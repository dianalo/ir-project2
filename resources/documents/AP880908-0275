But Perot's former company, which is challenging the attempt byPerot and the Postal Service to do business together, disputed theclaim in arguments Wednesday before a three-judge federal panelreviewing the case.   Electronic Data Systems Corp., which Perot sold to GeneralMotors Corp. in 1986, is challenging a contract between the PostalService and Perot and his new company, Perot Systems Corp.   Perot Systems Corp. won the contract without competitive bids ornotice to other companies that such a venture was envisioned.   The contract involves Perot studying the Postal Service andrecommending efficiency steps and then sharing the savings realizedfrom his ideas. It is Perot's first attempt to compete directlywith his former company.   ``This is an area where Congress has spoken often about the needfor competition,'' EDS attorney Richard Schecter told the judges.   EDS initially lodged a protest with the federal Board ofContract Appeals, and contended that the potentially lucrativecontract awarded to Perot conflicted with bidding rules. Theappeals board voided the contract in August.   The federal appeals court could reinstate the contract.   Two federal statutes were at the center of the argumentsWednesday. One requires most government agencies to solicitcompetitive bids on purchases involving computers and dataprocessing, and another created the Postal Service in 1970 as aquasi-private agency.   In creating the Postal Service, Congress freed it from federalrules and regulations unless specified by law.   Postal Service attorney Helene Goldberg said the Board ofContract Appeals does not have jurisdiction over the Postal Serviceand therefore lacks the authority to invalidate the Perot contract.   Clifton Elgarten, representing Perot Systems, said Congress'intent in creating the service was ``to free the Postal Servicefrom the constraints'' binding its predecessor.</TEXT></DOC>
