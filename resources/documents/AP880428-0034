The Nov. 9, 1987, accident at the Lawrence, Mass., freight yardhas been at the center of a labor dispute between GuilfordTransportation Industries and unionized workers who charged thatinexperience of a newly hired engineer led to the fatal accident.   About 1,200 rail workers walked off the job three days after theaccident to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions on thefreight line. The strike, in its sixth month, is against MaineCentral and Boston andamp; Maine lines now under Springfield Terminal Co.   ``Both sides have attempted to use the tragedy to theiradvantage, and the irony is that the report really doesn't supporteither position,'' FRA Administrator John Reilly said in atelephone interview Wednesday.   ``The company is clearly liable for the faulty repair on thehand brake,'' said, but added, ``We found nothing to support thelabor allegation that lack of experience or training by theengineer contributed to the accident.''   FRA investigators were unable to conclude if Richard Hopkinson,the veteran conductor and head of the three-member crew, properlyblocked the boxcar to prevent it from moving.   But the report said once the boxcar began to move, Hopkinsonapplied the hand brake without success. Reilly said a working brakewould have stopped the boxcar and prevented the tragedy, and thatthe problem could have caused the initial runaway.   Investigators discovered that Boston andamp; Maine repair crews failedto install the necessary weld on the brake system during repairsearlier in the year.   After realizing the brake failure, Hopkinson _ who was on therunaway car _ radioed instructions to the engineer to speed up tothe boxcar so the conductor could attempt to couple the two cars,which were moving at speeds that reached up to 25 mph.   The report said the engineer, who joined the strike, did notcontribute to the accident.   Eugene Lyden, vice president of the United Transportation Union,said he believes the report incorrectly dismisses the engineer'srole in the accident.   Guilford Vice President Colin Pease said the company was``gratified'' by the report and agreed with its conclusions.</TEXT></DOC>
