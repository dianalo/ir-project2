Areas coveredinclude: 1) breadth of frequency content; 2) effective ground acceleration;3) number of strong nonlinear response cycles and strong motion durationand 4) soil-structure interaction. Instrumental peak acceleration andcorresponding elastic response spectra are not suitable measures of structuraldamage and the above effects should be considered in defining designearthquake parameters.</TEXT></DOC>
