(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The long-delayed launch debuts of twonew military space rockets, the Delta 2 and Titan 4, should occurwithin two months as the Air Force prepares for what could be thebusiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday.   The commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, Air ForceCol. Lawrence L. Gooch, said the Delta 2, carrying a pair ofmilitary navigation satellites, is set for liftoff Feb. 7, with theTitan 4, which will be America's most powerful unmanned rocket, tofollow within a few weeks.   Gooch told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls forseven Delta 2s, two commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; twocommercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a Navy communicationssatellite, and six to eight submarine test launches of the Navy'spowerful new Trident 2 nuclear missiles.   In addition, the missile center will support seven NASA spaceshuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.   But launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold downthe total, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, butif we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to greatlyincrease its Titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttleChallenger in 1986.   Both the Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unmanned rocketsand putting all launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. AfterChallenger, officials realized this was a mistake and they orderedexpendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space.   Gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waitingfor a rocket ride, as a result of the 32-month shuttle standdownafter the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan34D for several months after back-to-back failures in 1885 and 1986.About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said.   Gooch said the range may have problems supporting the schedule ifthere are delays in a lot of the missions.   Citing the Trident 2 submarine launches, the first of which isscheduled in about two months, he said, ``If you have a Trident subat sea, and it comes in here for demonstration firings, that's a lotof resources and involves a national defense commitment.''   In most cases, the Trident launch probably would have priorityover all except the most critical defense satellite launches.   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 already has been delayed sixmonths and the debut of the Titan 4 about five months by problemspreparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads.   Another problem, Gooch said, could be a shortage of manpower tosupport launches. He said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operationsgroup.</TEXT></DOC>
