 The firm also offers several processor-independent Keyproducts.andP;  Each is internally customized to ensure uniqueness for eachdeveloper and application.andP;  All Key products are available for PCs under DOS,OS/2, Windows, and UNIX; several special versions for Macintoshes and otheroperating systems are available.andM;The Key series is ProTech's least-expensive, plain-vanilla system; it'stargeted at users supplying identically reproduced software.andP;  At manufacture,it is wired with both unique customer and software codes.andP;  During a program'sexecution, an interface decrypts and calls an assembler routine that checksfor the Key's presence and recognizes the codes.andP;  Calculations performed onfour random values called from the Key produce a constant number or returncode, but the exact values vary from call to call.andP;  Once an interrogation isevaluated, the routine is immediately re-encrypted and doesn't exist asexecutable code until it is called again by the interface instructions.andP;  Keyis available for PCs and can use serial or parallel ports.andM;A system-independent Microprocessor Key version communicates over anystandard RS-232 serial port.andP;  These keys include ROM-based firmware and aneight-bit microprocessor; key recognition is accomplished by unique lookuptables in the key's ROM.andP;  Data in these tables, inaccessible without specialroutines, is also stored onchip; these are accessed by seemingly randomstrings sent to the port from within an application.andM;For multiple software-protection tasks, Register Key provides 10 bytes ofmemory in five 16-bit words.andP;  The contents of the key's memory are controlledby the software developer, but they may not be changed from within anapplication.andP;  Register Key is available in serial and parallel versions forPCs.andM;The more memory-laden Memory Key features 62 bytes of userreprogrammable,nonvolatile EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory).andO;The field-alterable EEPROM chip allows power to be turned off withoutdisturbing the contents of memory locations.andP;  Memory Key can thus storesignificant parts of an application's code-normal use of a program withoutMemory Key is virtually impossible.andP;  Typically, jump vectors or severalcritical instructions can be stored in the unit's EEPROM.andM;Like many key products, Memory Key is placed on a PC's bidirectional printerport where it is accessed initially by an application program.andP;  Once data isretrieved, the program places the stored data into the correct places in amemory map, allowing application code to process normally.andP;  A slightly moresophisticated scheme can use Memory Key's EEPROM to store anencryption/decryption key to keep an application encrypted on a program disk.andO;In a typical start-up, a short decryption routine would load the decryptedmemory image after obtaining the decryption key from EEPROM.andM;ProTech offers two non-PC versions of Memory Key.andP;  Macintosh Memory Keyconnects to a Mac's SCSI port.andP;  Micro Memory Key, like Microprocessor Key,contains its own eight-bit processor and EEPROM and acts as an intelligentdevice connected to a standard serial port.andM;Like the serial microprocessor key, ProTech's latest product also includes amicroprocessor packing a unique communications protocol, but it talks over aprinter port.andP;  Processor Memory Key (PMK) decodes an 80-character string sentto it when the application's software runs.andP;  The string initializes thedevice and gets it ready to accommodate seemingly random data that can onlybe deciphered by an algorithm and associated data stored within the device'son-board ROM.andP;  Handling up to 31 16-bit words, PMK can be actively written toor read from.andP;  In addition to custom interrogation sequences, PMK can storecounter values, checksums, pointers, module identification words, activeprotectionmode data, or anything else a programmer wishes to include incopy-protection code.andM;With very short developer's instruction manuals (the one I reviewed was only13 pages long), ProTech provides very little insight about how its productswork-the company calls this an &quot;unwordy' approach.andP;  Moreover, all ofProTech's keys-like most competitive products-use resinmolding compound toconceal delicate surface-mount technology components.andP;  It's unlikely theboard's hardware would survive reverse-engineering attempts to remove theresin encapsulation.andP;  Floppies are supplied with the annotated source codenecessary to interrogate the keys.andM;The Key family's developer's kit includes one key and interrogation routinesfor Ada, C, Pascal, and BASIC as well as assembler, APL, COBOL,Clipper-compiled DBASE, FORTRAN, and Foxbase.andM;ProTech's interrogation consists of about 10 lines of set-up code and a callto an assembly language routine.andP;  The set-up code also inserts random bytesinto interrupt vectors used by debuggers, effectively disabling them.andP;  Thisroutine never exists as executable code except just before it is called.andO;After the routine interrogates the key, it encrypts itself again, so evendevelopers cannot learn much about a key's functions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
