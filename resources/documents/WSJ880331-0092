The cost wasn't disclosed.    The Danbury, Conn.-based chemical company said it is trying to respond &quot;as quickly as possible to the persisting tight resin-supply problems facing polyethylene fabricators.&quot; Polyethylene has diverse uses, including trash bags, lawn bags, insulating jacket systems and underground water pipes.    The new facility will add 500 million pounds a year of capacity to the Seadrift plant by the early 1990s, the company said. After this addition is completed, Union Carbide will add 500 million more pounds of annual capacity to polyethylene plants in Seadrift and in Taft, La.    The expansions will raise Union Carbide's total domestic polyethylene capacity to 3.1 billion pounds annually from 2.1 billion now. </TEXT></DOC>
