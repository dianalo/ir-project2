Buckets of sterilized flies were unleashed starting at 10 a.m.by workers in trucks cruising neighborhoods 20 miles northwest ofdowntown. Four million flies were being released.   An airplane was to release more flies in the afternoon, saidRobert Donley, deputy director of the county Agriculture Commission.   The release follows the weekend discovery of two Medflies in thevalley, bringing the total to six. Earlier aerial spraying also wasaimed at the pest that threatens the state's $14 billion-a-yearagricultural industry.   The tiny flies, dyed fluorescent pink to distinguish them fromfertile wild Medflies, mate with females so their eggs will neverhatch. The eggs can be deposited inside more than 250 varieties offruits and vegetables.   ``They're interested in eating and mating,'' state AgricultureDepartment spokeswoman Gera Curry said. ``They'll all go theirlittle ways looking for mates.''   The latest two live Medfly captures occurred in a backyard inReseda, inside a 62-square-mile quarantine area, said RobertDonley, deputy director of the Los Angeles County AgricultureCommission.   The immature male flies, one found Saturday, the other Sunday,are thought to have survived last week's malathion pesticidespraying because they were in ground cocoons, Donley said.   Officials think the flies flew almost immediately to the baitedtraps after emerging from their cocoons, Donley said, adding thatground spraying was carried out at the property.   The discovery won't force another round of aerial pesticidespraying, he said.   Officials removed thousands of traps in preparation for thesterile fly release, Donley said. Previously, more than 100 trapsper square mile were hung from trees in the residentialneighborhoods, he said.   The first release of 4 million from an airplane and rovingtrucks was to be followed by daily releases for about two months,totaling between 20 million and 40 million flies weekly, covereringtwo possible generations of Medfly development, Donley said.   Similar use of sterile male flies helped eradicate Medflyinfestation in eastern Los Angeles County last summer.   Three Medflies were discovered July 20 in fruit tree traps, anda fourth was found just before officials sprayed a 16-square-milearea of Northridge, Reseda and Sepulveda on July 25.   The Medflies are feared because they reproduce rapidly and useso many different fruits and vegetables as egg-laying sites,infesting the fruit with maggots.   Medflies are often brought to the mainland accidentally bytourists who bring fruits from Hawaii and Pacific Rim nations.   The sterile flies may wander into homes, but pose no healththreat to humans, and most people won't notice them, Ms. Curry said.   The sterile flies are raised at a state laboratory in Hawaii.The lab was established after the California's damaging 1981 Medflyinfestation, which cost the state $97.6 million in eradicationefforts.</TEXT></DOC>
