Already, thearresting officer files an affidavit of probable cause for the arrest, and acourt commissioner reviews it before the suspect ever appears in court.;   The affidavit is attached to the complaint, which must be issued before thesuspect is brought into court. California law requires that the first courtappearance, called an arraignment, be held as soon as possible or not longerthan two working days after the arrest. Representatives of both the SantaClara County public defender's office and the county district attorney'soffice said if the time limit is not met, the suspect is released.;    Writingfor the court today, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said such hearings generallymust be provided within 48 hours.;    If more than 48 hours pass before ahearing is granted, she said, &quot;the burden shifts to the government todemonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinarycircumstance.&quot;;    O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquistand Justices Byron R. White, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.;   Joining Scalia in dissent were the court's three most liberal justices --Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.;    Today'sdecision on warrantless arrests sent back to a federal appeals court a &quot;classaction&quot; civil rights lawsuit against Riverside County by Donald LeeMcLaughlin.;    He sued county officials in 1987 over the county's policy onproviding probable-cause hearings for people arrested without warrants.;   Most arrests require quick police action and are not accompanied by previouslyobtained court warrants. It is for those arrests that such hearings arerequired.;    And in Riverside County, the hearings are provided within 48working hours -- excluding weekends and holidays.;    The San Francisco-based9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that such hearings must be providedimmediately after an arrested person is booked.;    Writing for the high courttoday, O'Connor said the 9th Circuit court's ruling went too far. But sheadded that Riverside County's policy and practice &quot;do not comport fully withthe principles&quot; of providing prompt hearings.;    &quot;The county's current policyis to offer combined proceedings (an arraignment and probable-causedetermination) within two days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays or holidays,&quot;O'Connor said. &quot;As a result, persons arrested on Thursdays may have to waituntil the following Monday before they receive a probable-causedetermination.&quot;;    She said the delay could be even longer if there is anintervening holiday.;    &quot;The county's regular practice exceeds the 48-hourperiod we deem constitutionally permissible, meaning that the county is notimmune from systematic challenges, such as this class action.&quot;;    O'Connorsaid the 9th Circuit court or a federal trial judge should decide whether thecounty's policy is based on legitimate administrative reasons or merelyfosters &quot;delay for delay's sake.&quot;;    The case is Riverside County vs.McLaughlin, 89-1817.;    Other actions;    Other decisions today by theSupreme Court:; (box)Age bias -- The court ruled that workers may be barredfrom suing their bosses for alleged age bias if the employees previouslyagreed to submit such claims to binding arbitration.; (box)Alien asylum --Justices said they will hear arguments that a federal appeals court is usingtoo lenient a standard for determining which aliens are eligible for asylumunder the Refugee Act of 1980. The act requires aliens seeking asylum to show&quot;a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.&quot;;(box)Endangered species -- The court agreed to consider letting federalagencies ignore the impact on endangered species when they support projects inforeign countries. It said it will hear a Bush administration appeal tooverturn a victory for wildlife groups that want to protect endangered animalsoutside U.S. borders.; (box)Conrail antitrust -- Justices refused to kill alawsuit that charges Conrail with illegally monopolizing shipments ofnewsprint from Canada to mid-Atlantic states.; (box)Private lawyers --Justices left intact a Tennessee law that lets private lawyers representingcrime victims help prosecute criminal defendants. They rejected an appeal by aconvicted murderer who said he was denied a fair trial because two prominent,private lawyers helped the prosecutor.; (box)Jury information -- The courtleft intact a ruling that said Mississippi juries must be told whetherconvicted killers ever would be eligible for parole if sentenced to life inprison rather than death.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910513  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  919  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 13, 199100134108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
