 July 16.andO;The first order of business was to unpack the systems they had shipped to thesite.andM;Each team was then assigned a private room, which gave them a place todiscuss design plans.andP;  Some of the teams even brought whiteboards that theyused to sketch the application design.andM;At 9 a.m., the teams gathered in a meeting room to receive the officialtest-application specification.andP;  Ted Mirecki, senior technical analyst at PCWeek and mastermind of the technical side of the Database-DevelopmentShoot-Out, acted as master of ceremonies.andP;  The application to be developedwas a student registration and tracking system for a private secondary school(see sample spec at left).andM;For the next four days, the constestants spendt long hours working.andP;  Mostteams arrived when the offices opened at 7:30 a.m.andP;  and stayed until closing,at 8 p.m.andP;  Teams were not allowed to do work other than paper designs outsidethe offices.andM;Each morning and afternoon, Mirecki held a question-and-answer session forthe teams.andP;  This ensured that all contestans received the same information atthe same time.andM;The meetings also gave Mirecki an opportunity to spring a bit of real-lifemisery on the teams.andP;  To model the situation after a real-world corporatescenario where the client changes plans midproject, Mirecki made changes totwo of the data relations--one on the second day and one on the third.andM;The contest ended at 5 p.m.andP;  July 19, when the teams loaded theirapplications onto the evaluation systems (IBM PCs with 3M bytes of RAM andEGA resolution).andP;  It wasn't state-of-the-art hardware, but it's probablytypical for a private school or most corporate sites.andM;The next day, the teams showed their applications to the judges and packed uptheir development systems.andP;  An awards ceremony that afternoon gave the teamsan opportunity to unwind and socialize with the other contestants.andM;With the heat finally off, the contestants had a chance to look back at theexperience.andP;  &quot;Usually, the challenge of developing the application isenough,&quot; said Paul Kent of SAS Institute Inc. in Cary, N.C.andP;  &quot;Then add thestress of 16 competitors and a cheering section back at the ranch.&quot;andM;Doug Goldner of Data Access Corp. of Miami considered it a personalchallenge.andP;  &quot;This competition was a test of ingenuity, programming prowessand endurance.&quot;andM;Specification UpdatesandM;Add to the ChallengeandM;Of Database Shoot-outandM;Below is a sample of the original application specification and the two specupdates supplied to the participants in The 1990 PC Week LabsDatabase-Development Shoot-Out.andM;Original SpecificationandM;The application to be developed is a student registration and tracking systemfor a private secondary school (grades 9 through 12).andP;  The distinguishingcharacteristic of this school is that there is a high percentage of siblingsin the student body.andP;  Residence data and tuition accounts are to be kept bythe family; course registration records and grades by the student.andM;Initially, the application will run on the school's stand-alone 286-based PCwith 1M byte of RAM, a 20M-Byte hard disk, EGA video monitor and aHewlett-Packard Co.andP;  Laser-Jet II.andP;  The school could be persuaded to add anadditional 2M bytes of RAM if the application absolutely requires it;however, implementations that run in the original configuration will receivefavorable consideration in scoring.andM;Eventually, the application will migrate to a networked environment of threeto 10 workstations, with multiple concurrent entry, update and queries.andP;  Ifthe initial implementation is not LAN-ready, it must be accompanied by awritten statement outlining the changes required to migrate the applicationto the new environment.andP;  The network software and hardware have not beenchosen at this time; the school will consider any reasonable recommendation.andM;Specification Update 1andM;&quot;New Guardianship Structure&quot;andM;The data model of each student belonging to one and only one family is notentirely realistic.andP;  Because of divorces, a student's two guardians may bemembers of two different families.andM;For a student with guardians in two families, one family will be designatedas responsible for the student's tuition.andP;  The multiple-student discountswill be given on the basis of payment responsibility, not residence.andP;  Forexample, if three students from one address are registered, but the tuitionfor two of them is paid by another guardian, then the guardian who lives withthe students pays the single-student rate and the other guardian pays thetwo-student rate.andM;Specification Update 2andM;&quot;Class Schedules&quot;andM;You may choose to implement any portion of the following.andP;  You are notlimited to using the database software used for the main functions.andM;Produce a schedule of courses that:andM;a) minimizes scheduling conflicts in the existing registration data, andandM;b) conforms to a set of rules involving student time and class availabilityrequirement.andM;From the Editor-in-ChiefandM;Few corporate buyers evaluate computing solutions the way they'd like to.andM;In a perfect world, buyers would hold technical &quot;auditions&quot; where prospectivevendors would come to town and &quot;read&quot; for the part.andP;  Buyers would then sitback and judge which vendors best perform their tasks on stage, when itcounts.andM;This is the concept behind the 1990 PC Week Labs Database-DevelopmentShoot-Out and subsequent Shoot-Outs headed your way.andM;The corporate buyers' world is far from perfect.andP;  People who evaluatepotential computing solutions need much more than technical specifications.andO;They need to observe how seemingly similar candidates perform under pressurein a real-world environment.andP;  They need to gauge how a product's technicalstructure suits their specific application and, in programming, the extent towhich human interaction can wring the most productivity from that solution.andM;PC Week pioneered the concept of editorial Shoot-Outs, and we're not about torest.andP;  Shoot-Outs that focus on 3270 emulation under Windows, 3.0, networkmanagement and other key corporate-computing disciplines are around thecorner.andM;I cordially invite your comments on the PC Week Labs Shoot-Out and how it canserve you even better.andM;Database International Inc./DataEase version 4.2andM;Database is a database manager and development system aimed at bothinexperienced users and professional developers.andP;  Its centerpiece is anonprocedural forms-based development environment that can implement mostdatabase functions with virtually no programming.andP;  A fourth-generationprogramming language and hooks to third-generation languages are provided forcases that cannot be handled by the forms generator.andP;  The underlying datamodel is entity-relational.andM;Winner: Best Overall ApplicationandM;Borland International Inc./Paradox version 3.01aandM;Paradox is a database manager with a highly relational table-oriented datamodel.andP;  Its strong suit is interactive, menu-driven data manipulation inresponse to ad-hoc user input, but it also has a programming language with anon-typical, menu-based syntax for implementing customized applications.andO;Code can be written by hand or generated automatically with an applicationbuilder called Personal Programmer.andM;Honorable Mention: Best Overall ApplicationandM;Precision Software Inc./Superbase 4 for Windows version 1.20andM;Superbase 4 is a database manager that runs under Microsoft Windows, usingall of the graphic user interface facilities of that environment.andP;  also, itcan store graphical data in the database and display graphics on the screenalong with textual data common to most database systems.andP;  SuperBase issuitable for both end-user computing and professional development of customapplications; to this end, it includes both non-procedural and procedurallanguage capabilities.andP;  It can directly read and write dBASE II and IIIfiles.andM;Honorable Mention: Best Overall ApplicationandM;Aker Corp./Magic PC 3.5andM;Magic PC is a non-procedural development system that does away with mosttraditional programming.andP;  Databases andoperations on them are defined bymaking entries in a set of tables: data dictionary tables, menu tables andtask tables.andP;  It is not a code generator in the usual sense, however, becauseit does not create source code that can be examined and fine-tuned.andP;  Instead,the tables are used directly to drive the database retrieval engine.andM;Caltex Software Inc./D the Data Language version 2.7.8andM;D the Data Language is an object-oriented fourth-generation language fordefining and manipulating relational databases.andP;  The development environmentis highly interactive, with WYSIWYG definition of screen forms and menus.andO;Programming is done in a high-level, top-down language that treats files,screens, menus and reports as objects.andM;Clarion Software/Clarion Professional Developer version 2.1andM;Clarion Professional Developer incorporates a programming languagereminiscent of COBOL and PL/I.andP;  Its user interface and report-writingcomponents are highly non-procedural, but the file-handling syntax isstrongly indicative of its third-generation-language heritage.andP;  Thecenterpiece of the system is a menu-driven application generator that canautomatically create all of the declarative and most of the procedural code,greatly speeding up the development process.andM;Data Access Corp./DataFlex 2.3bandM;DataFlex is a relational database manager aimed at professional developersfor creating custom applications.andP;  Accordingly, interactive processing isvery limited, and almost all database operations must be programmed.andP;  Thelanguage is somewhat procedural, but an automated application generatorreduces the tedium of hand-coding the most common operations.andM;Information Builders Inc./PC Focus release 5.5andM;PC Focus is an application-development and decision-support environment withcomprehensive reporting, graphics, statistics and spreadsheet capabilities.andO;It incorporates both a fourth-generation language and an automatedapplication generator for creating database definitions, user interfaces andprocessing procedures.andP;  PC Focus is available for a variety of platforms,from microcomputers through minicomputers to mainframes, and on each platformit can access data managed by a number of standard database systems.andM;Microrim Inc./R:base version 3.0andM;R:base is a relational database manager with both interactive anc programmingcomponents.andP;  It maintains tight control over database integrity, in bothinteractive and programmed modes, by managing a database as an intergratedentity made up of a collection of tables relations and data constraints.andO;R:base can automatically generate SAA-compliant user interfaces.andM;Must Software International/PC Nomad version 2.5andM;PC Nomad is a relational database manager suitable for both applicationsdevelopment and end-user computing.andP;  It provides a windowed user interface,supports rule-based referential integrity, and has both procedural andnon-procedural language capabilities.andP;  It can be used in either stand-alonemode on a single PC or in cooperative-processing mode with remote minis andmainframes.andP;  Versions are available for DEC VAX/VMS and IBM mainframesystems.andM;Progress Software Corp./Progress version 5.21andM;Progress is a fourth-generation language and relational database-managementsystem that allows professional developers to create complex applications fordistributed computing environments.andP;  It includes FastTrack, an automated codegenerator for speeding up the development process.andP;  Progress is availablefor, and applications developed with it are portable across, MS-DOS, OS/2,VAX/VMS, CTOS/BTOS and various versions of Unix.andM;Revelation Technologies Inc./Advanced Revelation version 2.01andM;Advanced Revelation is a relational database manager with somecharacteristics not typically found in other systems of this type.andP;  Datarecords are not rigidly divided into fixed-length fields, but can containmultiple instances of variable-length data.andP;  A data dictionary automaticallymanages the relations and constraints in multiple-table databases.andM;SAS Institute Inc./The SAS Application System release 6.04andM;The centerpiece of the SAS Application System is its statistical-analysiscapabilities, which range from simple descriptive statistics to complexmultivariate techniques.andP;  In addition, the system includes tools forrelational-database management, report writing, econometrics and forecasting,operations research, decision support and quality control.andP;  Experienced userscan develop customized menu-driven applications incorporating full-screenprocessing and data-entry capabilities.andP;  A host-link facility providesconnectivity between an SAS session on a PC and remote SAS sessions on any ofa variety of mini and mainframe operating environments.andM;Software Products International/Open Access III versin 3.01andM;Open Access III is an intergrated program with spreadsheet, word-processingand communications components in addition to the relational database managerthat is the product's core.andP;  The programming language has a decidedlydatabase orientation, but includes facilities for creating attractive userinterfaces incorporating drop-down menus.andP;  Procedures written in C can beincorporated for tasks beyond the scope of the built-in language.andM;Sterling Software Inc./ZIM version 3.11andM;ZIM is a database manager and development system based on theentity-relational data model.andP;  It includes report and query generators, aforms creation and manipulation module, and a fourth-generation English-likeprogramming language with compiler.andM;WordTech Systems Inc./dBXL version 1.3B and Quicksilver version 1.38andM;dBXL is an interactive database manager that handles dBASE III-compatiblefiles and interpretively executes an enhanced dialect of the dBASEprogramming language.andP;  Quicksilver is a compiler for that language, producingstand-alone EXE files of the final application.andP;  one major advantage ofWordTech's dialect over Ashton-Tate's dBASE III + is support for a windoweduser interface.andM;Ashton-Tate/dBASE III + version 1.1andM;With Ashton-Tate declining to participate, dBASE was represented by the onlyend-user team in the competition.andP;  They were John Gregor, assistant executivedirector, engineering and operations, and Richard Phillips,engineer-in-training, of the Nashville Metro Traffic and Parking Commission.andM;Although dBASE does include an interactive database manager, it is primarilyuseful as an applications-development tool.andP;  Developing applications requireswriting procedural code by hand, but third-party applications-generationtools are available.andP;  The database structure implemented in dBASE is anindustry standard, and many other databases, whether or not they incorporatedialects of the dBASE language, can read files in this format.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
