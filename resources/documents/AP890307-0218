REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After years of decline, the Philippineeconomy shows signs of revival, and business leaders hope that themodest boom heralds desperately needed stability for PresidentCorazon Aquino's government.   Serious problems still face the Aquino administration, includinga burgeoning population, environmental destruction and the fact thatmillions of Filipinos have not yet benefited economically from theturnaround.   The Philippines, which had been East Asia's second-most-developednation after Japan, now lags far behind other non-CommunistSoutheast Asian economies after 20 years of misrule under oustedPresident Ferdinand Marcos.   Government figures show that more than 60 percent of the 58million Filipinos live below the poverty line. Millions still leaveeach year in search of employment abroad.   Nonetheless, the economy has grown during each year since Mrs.Aquino took power in the February 1986 uprising against Marcos. Herrise to power followed two straight years of negative growth andsoaring inflation.   Throughout the capital, construction projects have resumed, anddepartment stores are jammed with shoppers on weekends and holidays.   Mrs. Aquino abolished the ruinous state monopolies on sugar andcoconut export, which Marcos and his associates used to corner thosemarkets, and moved slowly to remove government from private business.   Last year, the gross national product grew by 6.7 percent, whileinflation remained under 9 percent. According to government figures,unemployment fell from 11.2 percent in 1987 to 9.6 percent, duemostly to a boom in construction that absorbed out-of-work farmers.   Agriculture, which provides the livelihood of about 65 percent ofFilipinos, grew 3.4 percent despite several destructive typhoons.   Economists say most of the economic growth is due to consumerspending _ up 5.1 percent in 1988 _ thanks in large measure to arelaxation of import restrictions and a drop in world petroleumprices.   But the favorable figures have led to renewed optimism within theforeign and Filipino business community that the country may at lastbe on the road to recovery.   ``In sharp contrast to the wait-and-see attitude so prevalentjust two years ago, businessmen, entrepreneurs and consumers tookpositive and decisive steps to keep the Philippine economic recoveryon the right track,'' said the influential Makati Business Club in areport.   In 1988, the Board of Investments approved $1.47 billion worth ofinvestment projects, up 216 percent over the previous year. About 22percent of the total came from foreign investors.   Last Friday, Toyota and Mitsui inaugurated a new automanufacturing plant in suburban Paranaque that will be half-owned byFilipinos.   Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion said total exports last yearreached $7.07 billion. South Korea and Hong Kong broke through thatbarrier 12 years ago, but nevertheless the figure represented a 24percent increase in Philippine exports over the previous year.   The boom has not been limited to Manila, which traditionallyoutpaces the rest of the island nation. Last year, the economy inCebu City and surrounding islands grew by 7.5 percent.   In Davao City, exports of wood and processed foods topped $450million last year. Construction in the southern city tripled from1987 levels and banks reported a 35 percent increase in businessloans.   Western diplomats and Filipino commentators believe politicalstability has been the key to the economic rebound. After a seriesof failed coups in 1986 and 1987, including the abortive putsch onAug. 28, 1987, that killed 53 people, there were no serious, armedattempts against Mrs. Aquino last year.   Rumors of new, right-wing conspiracies periodically sweep Manila.But there has been a growing sense here that Mrs. Aquino will finishher term in 1992.   A dramatic upsurge in street killings by Communist rebels in thecapital tapered off last year because of a police crackdown and apublic backlash to the carnage.   In addition, the wave of strikes which swept Manila, Cebu andother industrial areas in the months after Marcos' downfall declinedsharply. In October 1987, Mrs. Aquino ordered a crackdown on illegalstrikes. Barricades that blocked pedestrian and vehicle traffic weretorn down and strike leaders were frequently arrested.   According to the Labor Department, those measures reduced thenumber of strikes from 484 in 1987 to 296 last year. Governmentfigures show production time lost because of strikes fell by 20percent in 1988 over the previous year.</TEXT></DOC>
