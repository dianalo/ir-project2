Nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere, mostly asnitric acid, appear to contribute about 25 percent of totalnitrogen flowing into Chesapeake Bay, said the EnvironmentalDefense Fund in a report by staff scientists.   Ammonium compounds from the atmosphere, mostly originating inthe evaporation of manure, contribute another 14 percent of thebay's nitrogen load, the report said.   The damage comes not from the acidity, which is immediatelyneutralized by salt water, but from the overload of nutrientsprovided by nitrates and ammonium. These fertilizers encourage``blooms'' of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water,making it difficult for other plants and fish to live, and cut offlight necessary for bottom-anchored plants to grow.   By contrast, the fund estimated the nitrogen contribution fromfertilizer runoff at 34 percent, municipal and industrialdischarges at 23 percent and direct runoff from animal waste at 4percent.   Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist on the fund staffand one of the study's authors, said, ``This should change foreverour view of the acid rain problem,'' showing that ``sewage from thesky'' in the form of nitrogen compounds are a major pollutant ofinshore waters.   Although the fund's scientists concentrated on Chesapeake Bay,they said there was evidence these airborne compounds also arecontributing to problems in Delaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Soundin North Carolina, Long Island Sound between New York andConnecticut and the New York Bight in the Atlantic Ocean off NewYork and New Jersey.   Nationwide, a little more than 21 million tons of nitrogenoxides are emitted from all sources, about one third from motorvehicle exhausts, one third from power plant smokestacks and oneseventh from industrial boilers.   The fund said it had provided the first estimate of how much ofthe nitrogen flowing into the bay originates in the atmosphere,both as runoff into streams and as direct precipitation on thebay's surface.   The fund's estimate of 154,000 tons of nitrogen compoundsflowing into the bay from all sources was higher than the 110,000estimated by the federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution controlprogram for an average year, but within the range of that program'sestimates of 92,000 tons for a dry year to 198,000 tons for a wetyear.   The joint program has set a goal of reducing nitrogen loading onthe bay by 40 percent, and the fund's report said a 40 percentreduction should be aimed for in airborne nitrogen.   Oppenheimer called for enactment of one of the acid rain controlbills pending before Congress, saying, ``With the exception of newauto controls, the states on the Atlantic Seaboard can begin thisprogram on their own, but they cannot finish it. ... A strongfederal role is absolutely necessary.''   Bob Beck, environment manager of the Edison Electric Institute,the major trade association of private utilities, said nitrogenoxides from his industry were declining.   Chris Rice, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency,said EPA had not had a chance to study the fund's report and thuscould not comment immediately.   The report kicks off three days of rallies, press conferencesand other events by environmental groups seeking an acid raincontrol program that the Reagan administration opposes on thegrounds that not enough is known to justify it. The activity istimed to coincide with the visit of Canadian Prime Minister BrianMulroney, who also is seeking a U.S. program because half the acidrain falling in Canada originates in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
