In the occupied territories, troops wounded seven Palestiniansin scattered stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officialsreported.   In three villages and a refugee camp in the West Bank, about3,000 Israeli activists from the Peace Now movement met with Arabswho have lost family members in the 17-month-old uprising. Soldierswatched the gatherings from afar without intervening.   Leaders of the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip condemned the meetings.   In the West Bank village of Nahalin, 200 Palestinian men, womenand children greeted the Israelis.   ``I stand here and greet you because we need peace,'' saidMohammed Attiyah, whose 22-year-old son Subhi was shot and killedin a raid last month that left five Palestinians dead and 18injured.   Palestinians warned that uprising activists were inclined to useweapons against the army if Israel persisted in its refusal to talkpeace with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which thegovernment considers a terrorist organization.   ``The people with weapons are beginning to wake up,'' saidvillage leader Abu Khalid. ``We must warn that a true revolution ispossible if we do not achieve our rights.''   ``We must remind the Israeli government that the Palestiniannation has its roots here, and there must be peace with our solelegitimate representative, the PLO,'' Khalid said.   Last week, a soldier was killed and three Palestinians woundedin the first gun battle between Israeli troops and Arab activists.In all, 498 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have died since therebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip began in December 1987.   The Peace Now movement advocates opening talks with thePalestine Liberation Organization and establishing an independentPalestinian state. The Israeli government has ruled out either.   ``If we can prove to Israelis that relations, even political,are possible, it would also make possible the idea of a compromiseand withdrawal,'' Yoki Amir, a Hebrew University lecturer, said atNahalin.   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded sevenPalestinians in stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officialsreported. They said the victims included a 16-year-old girl shot inthe head and a 60-year-old woman shot in the ear.   The army said it was checking the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
