Within the Fed, pressure for a prompt easing move isgrowing. &quot;Outside of manufacturing, the numbers aren't sogood,&quot; one top Fed official said yesterday. And even inmanufacturing, the official added, the anticipated uptick inproduction from rebuilding of inventories is surprisinglysmall.</LP><TEXT>   The dollar is strong, money-supply growth remains weak andthe bond market's favorable response to an expected easingweakens the case for waiting any longer, the Fed officialsaid. And a midmonth action would be more likely to nudgebanks to cut their prime lending rate another notch, theofficial added.   The most likely Fed action is a one-half point cut in thediscount rate, at which the Fed lends to financialinstitutions, and a one-quarter point cut in the federalfunds rate, at which banks lend to each other. Both rates arecurrently at 5 1/2%.   The Fed last moved to cut interest rates in early Augustand the bond market clearly is enthusiastic about anotherround. The bond market's bellwether security, the Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year bond, advanced 1 1/8 points, a gain of$11.25 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Theissue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of itsprice, eased to 7.92%, the lowest closing yield on abenchmark 30-year bond since December 1989.   &quot;It was the busiest trading day we've had since the end ofthe Persian Gulf War,&quot; about six months ago, said WilliamSullivan, director of money market research at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. &quot;Trading was very, very strong.&quot;   Bond prices began to climb in early trading, shortly afterthe government released a better-than-expected report oninflation. The Labor Department said the producer priceindex, a measure of inflation on the wholesale or producerlevel, rose 0.2% last month. That was much lower than the0.4% gain that many economists had expected and was widelyviewed as the &quot;green light&quot; needed to prompt officials at theFed to push interest rates down further. Over the past 12months, producer prices have climbed only 2.9%.   The rally picked up steam later in the day after theFederal Reserve released the latest money supply figures.   The Fed reported that the money supply measure known asM2, the aggregate most closely watched by the Fed, fell $9.7billion in the week ended Sept. 2. The report also showedthat M2 was growing at an annual rate of about 2.4% throughthe latest reporting period, below the Fed's 1991 targetgrowth band of 2.5% to 6.5%.   &quot;The inflation numbers are turning out to be outstanding,the economy is not going any place and money supply growth isvery weak -- the ingredients seem in place for the FederalReserve to ease,&quot; said Bruce Lakefield, manager of governmenttrading at Lehman Government Securities Inc., a unit ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.   As a result, Mr. Lakefield said, investors are activelybuying bonds in an effort to lock in current yields beforethey move any lower.   The bond market rally picked up steam later in the dayafter the Federal Reserve released the latest money supplydata. The money supply measure known as M2, the aggregatemost closely watched by the Fed, fell $9.7 billion in theweek ended Sept. 2. The steep decline put the M2 growth rateso far this year at 2.4%, below the Fed's annual growthtarget band of 2.5% to 6.5%. The money supply measure knownas M1 declined $2.6 billion in the latest reporting week andM3 fell $10.8 billion.   &quot;The market overwhelmingly believes that a cut in thediscount rate and the federal funds rate is imminent, maybenot today but over the coming days or weeks,&quot; said PhilipBraverman, senior vice president at DKB Government SecuritiesInc., a unit of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. &quot;It's reasonable toexpect that the Fed will ease given the weak condition of theeconomy. It's hard to find a justification for them not toease.&quot;   Several analysts warn, however, that the bond market couldsell off if the Fed decides not to ease. &quot;An easing isalready priced into the market,&quot; said Robert Andres, aprincipal at Martindale, Andres andamp; Godshalk Inc.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury issues ended sharply higher. The benchmark30-year bond ended at a price of 102 7/32 to yield 7.92%, thelowest closing yield on a benchmark bond since December 1989.The bond was quoted at 101 4/32 to yield 8.01% on Wednesday.   Prices of shorter-term Treasurys also shot up. The latesttwo-year notes ended at a price of 100 14/32 to yield 6.12%compared with 100 9/32 to yield 6.20%.   Treasury bill rates tumbled. The discount rate onthree-month bills ended at 5.18% for a bond equivalent yieldof 5.32% compared with 5.25% to yield 5.39% on Wednesday. Thediscount rate on six-month bills ended at 5.19% to yield5.40% compared with 5.27% to yield 5.48%.                                                                                                          Corporate, Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bonds of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. retreatedafter a report that one of the parties potentially interestedin making a bid for the troubled retailer is no longerseeking to pursue the transaction.   Carter Hawley said one of two parties who had asked toreview non-public information about the company returned thedata and said it was &quot;not interested in pursuing atransaction.&quot;   Carter Hawley's 12.25% senior subordinated notes, due in1996, fell 1 1/2 points to a bid price of 42 1/2 inover-the-counter trading. In the broader high-yield market,prices of junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities withlow credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, sagged to endwith losses of 1/8 point.   Carter Hawley confirmed earlier that two unidentifiedparties had sought nonpublic information from the companywith an eye to making a bid that would compete with thepending 40-cents-on-the-dollar tender offer from a fundcontrolled by Chicago investor Sam Zell.   The Carter Hawley bonds rallied earlier in the year onspeculation that a wealthy investor would seek to buy thecompany and would tender for the bonds at levels above theones they are trading at now. The bowing out of one of thepotentially interested parties diminishes the chances of asale, analysts say.   In the secondary market for investment-grade corporatedebt, high-grade bonds advanced, following U.S. Treasurysecurities sharply higher, to finish as much as 5/8 pointhigher.   Even though interest rates fell sharply yesterday, fewcorporations stepped into the market to take advantage.   Investment bankers say many corporations are waiting tosee whether the Federal Reserve will cut the federal fundsrate and the discount rate after today's August consumerprice index report.   Among companies selling debt yesterday was Shell Oil Co.,which offered $250 million of four-year notes priced to yield7.04%. The notes were won in competitive bidding throughunderwriters at Lehman Brothers Inc.                                                                                                          Municipal Issues                                                                                                          Pennsylvania's offering of $1.45 billion of taxanticipation notes fared well.   Nine underwriting groups purchased the issue, most ofwhich was offered to investors with a yield of 4.75%.   Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. won the largest portion of thePennsylvania deal awarded to a single underwriter; Goldmanpurchased $388.9 million of the issue.   The 4.75% yield on the issue, which matures June 30, 1992,is about fifteen-hundredths of a percentage point higher thanthe current yield on the bellwether California revenueanticipation notes, which also mature in late June 1992.   Meanwhile, most actively traded municipals finishedunchanged to 3/8 point higher after moderately activedealings.   In negotiated action, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. grouptentatively priced $75 million New Jersey Building Authoritystate building revenue bonds.   The bonds, which are zero-coupon college savings bonds,were priced to yield to maturity from 5.90% in 1999 to 6.65%in 2009-2011.   The New Jersey Building Authority offering marks the firstsale of Garden State college savings bonds under the newGarden State Savings Bond Act passed earlier this month, aDean Witter official said. The bonds are noncallable and willbe marketed to New Jersey residents only.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          The first two deals were priced yesterday from a hugeslate of expected offerings from the Resolution Trust Corp.,which earlier this week filed a $10 billion mortgagesecurities shelf registration with the Securities andExchange Commission.
