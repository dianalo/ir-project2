San JoseState is 2-8, 0-1.; San Jose State update: The good news is that no otherSpartans have joined the disabled over the past 48 hours. When G Andre Brooksrecently went down with a sprained ankle, he became the third potentialstarter knocked out of the starting lineup. PG Sub Crump's emergence willhelp. He had 12 points and four assists in a 70-62 loss Wednesday to UC-SantaBarbara, his best performance to date.; UC-Irvine update: A slimmer, trimmer CRicky Butler will lead the Anteaters, who lost twice to the Spartans lastseason. The 6-foot-7 Butler, who scored 37 points and grabbed 21 rebounds inthose two games, dropped 15-20 pounds over the summer to bring his playingweight down to about 240. He's averaging 17.9 points and 7.8 rebounds thisseason.
