But therally cooled, and most of the gains were erased.   The September contract ended 0.90 cent a pound higher at88.85 cents. It traded as high as 89.20 cents and as low as87.50.</LP><TEXT>   Prices were strong initially on reports that a cold wavewas expected to come in from Chile and hit Braziliancoffee-growing areas early this morning, a trade source said.Later, the forecast was changed and the colder temperaturesare expected to arrive this evening and early tomorrow,according to the dealer. He said another cold wave isexpected to hit Tuesday and a third on Thursday.   According to Peter Leavitt, meteorologist for WeatherServices Corp., Bedford, Mass., the reports were basicallycorrect, but &quot;I don't expect any freezing weather,&quot; he said.   The strongest cold wave will be the first one, he said,and temperatures in major coffee-growing areas such as SaoPaulo, Minas Gerais and Parana are expected to range between37 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday morning. The coldesttemperatures will be in the most southern areas such asParana.   &quot;Those temperatures will be the lowest, and the coldmovements next week will be mostly in Argentina and head eastrather than northward toward Brazil,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said.   It is winter in Brazil, when that nation's coffee cropsare most susceptible to cold weather damage. July 15 isgenerally regarded as the point of greatest danger, with thelikelihood of damaging frost receding after that. However,there have been damaging frosts in late August and even atthe beginning of September.   A major frost in July 1975 wiped out the coffee harvest inthe then-major coffee-producing state of Parana, which wasalso the southernmost coffee-producing area. Since then,coffee-growing has been intensified in more northern statessuch as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.   Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities,New York, observed that the selling, which trimmed the earlygains, came mostly from producing countries, which wereselling contracts to lock in prices and take advantage of thegains.   &quot;There also appeared to be some liquidation as it becameevident that there wasn't any damage in Guatemalancoffee-growing areas because of the earthquake earlier in theweek,&quot; he said.   There was some profit-taking following three days ofadvances as well, he said. But, with the prospect of coldweather on Sunday and next week, renewed demand developed andhelped firm prices toward the close.   Stephen Platt, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago,said that contributing to the recent strength in prices hasbeen strong rains, particularly in western sections of SaoPaulo and Parana.   &quot;This has caused concern over possible deterioration ofcoffee quality and some yield losses as well,&quot; he said.   In other markets yesterday:                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices were strong. The October contractrose 0.44 cent a pound to 11.43 cents. No fresh developmentsaccounted for the rally, analysts said. However, one analyst,noting the October price had dropped five cents since thebeginning of May, said the market may have been oversold.There was active buying of contracts by dealers, according tothe analyst, but it wasn't known whether the buying wasassociated with transactions in the cash market. The recentprice declines were attributed mainly to the lack of demandfor sugar from major nations such as the Soviet Union andChina, excellent current crop progress and improved prospectsfor the 1990-91 crop, according to Judith Ganes, analyst forMerrill Lynch. However, Ms. Ganes said buying by smallernations cumulatively has surpassed expectations for theseason so far and to a large degree has made up for the lackof major buyers. In the first 10 months of the 1989-90season, which began last September, 34 countries bought atotal of six million tons of sugar. Ms. Ganes said the Germanstatistical firm F.O. Licht had predicted those nations wouldbuy just 6,250,000 tons over the whole season.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices declined. The September contractwas off 1.40 cents a pound to $1.1790. Expectations of astrong rise in copper supplies and news that Asarco Inc. andthe United Steelworkers Union would resume contract talkscontributed to the easier tone, analysts said. Asarco and theunion will sit down together for the first time since July 3,two days after the workers went on strike at the company'smine in Arizona, a company spokesman said. The old contractran out June 30. One analyst said the general feeling is thatonce the company and the union resume negotiations, asettlement would follow soon. The increase in London MetalExchange warehouse stocks of copper is expected to range from5,000 to 20,000 tons when it is announced today, analystssaid. Earlier in the week, there were predictions that thestocks would increase by as much as 10,000 tons.   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futurescontracts retreated for the second consecutive day. Analystsattributed the decline to signs that meatpackers are havingan easier time finding hogs to slaughter. Hog prices havebeen strong most of the year because of tight supplies. Atthe same time, high retail prices caused by those high hogprices appear to be choking off demand for pork in thesupermarket. The contract for July delivery of pork bellies,which are used to make bacon, fell its daily limit of twocents to settle at 46.5 cents a pound. Prices of most cattlefutures contracts slipped in quiet trading.</TEXT></DOC>
