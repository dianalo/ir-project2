Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson waitedimpatiently for word he could fly out of his ranch on the PedernalesRiver.   The flight hinged on a National Weather Service forecast, left toa neophyte weatherman with more than a little awe of the vicepresident.   Ron McPherson says it was one of his toughest calls in threedecades of forecasting: ``I was a 22-year-old kid with a year'sservice and here's a vice president who wants to get out of hisranch. When he wanted to go somewhere, he wanted to go. He didn'ttake too kindly to the clouds covering the hills.''   But for McPherson, there was no other way. Johnson had to make itto Austin by car. Johnson's pilot let McPherson know the vicepresident was not too happy with the arrogance of the weather.   The memory has stayed with McPherson through his career whichbegan as an undergraduate intern in 1959 while at the University ofTexas in Austin, one that has now taken him to the agency'ssecond-highest post.   He was named deputy director of the weather service in Septemberand started work in mid-October, in charge of day-to-day operationsat an organization attempting to move into the 21st century.   ``But what better person is there than a guy who worked his wayup in the system?'' asks Don Witten, a spokesman for the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration which operates the weatherservice.   The service has 299 offices nationwide responsible for watchingand warning of storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and flash floods. Itplays a key role in space and air travel and is at the edge ofresearch into understanding such phenomena as drought, wind shearand turbulent storms that die almost as quickly as they erupt.   What attracts McPherson to weather, he says, is its uncertainty.   ``It's knowing that you're dealing with something slippery.You're trained to deal with uncertainty, fragments of evidence, morethan any other profession than maybe law,'' he says.   Those fragments come from scores of sources around the countryand the world _ from forecasters in the field and thousands ofvolunteer storm spotters, weather balloons and river forecastingcenters at the headwaters of the nation's major waterways, ships atsea and satellites hovering above the equator and circling the poles.   The weather service, which traces its roots to the Army's SignalCorps in the late 1800s, has sometimes been on the cutting edge oftechnology and other times lagged behind, McPherson says.   Now the weather service is trying to buy its way into the future,ordering up some sophisticated new electronic equipment to replacesome of its antiquated methods and gear. The new probes will allowforecasters to look inside a major storm system and maybe evenpredict a tornado in the embyronic stage, or the kinds of storms andsqualls that spark killer flash floods.   It is part of the NEXRAD project of the service, the Air Forceand the Federal Aviation Agency.   The basic unit is automated Doppler radar, which will allowmeteorologists to look inside weather systems to see the movement ofwater droplets, vapor and dust particles which will betray otherwiseinvisible winds and air turbulence, which will in turn betray theformation of severe storms and tornadoes.   Doppler radar is more refined than current radar which can onlydetect water in weather systems, but not its movement. A Dopplersystem reads the returning radar echo and determines whether it isshortening or lengthening, much the way the ear can determine thatan approaching ambulance siren has a higher pitch than one goingaway. Computers can then give operators a more instant and fluidreading on what is going on inside clouds.   The first of the 170 to 190 units will be installed in the early1990s at a cost of $2.5 million each.   McPherson hopes, too, that they will help explain how the weathersystems work.   ``You can't forecast what you don't understand, and you have tobe able to observe what you're going to forecast.''   McPherson's most recent job was as chief of the meteorologicaloperations division at the National Meteorological Center, a weatherservice branch outside Washington. He moved there from San Antonio20 years ago.   Growing up in Port Arthur, McPherson says he was bitten by theweather bug as a 12-year-old Boy Scout working on a weather meritbadge. As part of the assignment, McPherson says he read a passagefrom the book, ``Storm,'' by George R. Stewart.   ``The story is about a forecast office on the West Coast trackinga major Pacific storm and its impact on land and on people. It wasvery impressive for a 12-year-old kid,'' he says.   ``As it turns out, I've run into at least eight or 10 people whohave read the same novel and gotten into meteorology through theinfluence of that novel. It's a little dated now, but it's still agood story.''   ``You can get hooked on weather,'' Don Witten of NOAA says.``What is it that touches every human life on earth? One of theanswers is weather. It can make you an orphan, it can bring you afresh crop. It can cause you a lot of trouble getting to work; yetthere's nothing like a beautiful day.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
