Hours after Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredyand five bodyguards were killed in a hail of gunfire Friday,authorities pledged to hunt down Pablo Escobar, Colombia's cocainegodfather and its most-wanted criminal.   President Bush called President Virgilio Barco to congratulatehim and the country's security forces for eliminating RodriguezGacha, who has been implicated in hundreds of murders ofpoliticians, judges and peasants.   Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels are believedresponsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the streetsof the United States.   The operation was by far the biggest success of Barco's16-week-old war on drug traffickers. Authorities said GachaRodriguez in fact had ordered the Aug. 18 assassination of aleading presidential candidate, the slaying that led to thegovernment's crackdown on traffickers.   A Bogota daily, La Prensa, today quoted a journalist who waspresent at the raid as saying Rodriguez Gacha killed himself with ahand grenade after he was cornered by police.   The journalist was identified as Silvio Cohen, a correspondentfor Barranquilla's El Heraldo newspaper. La Prensa said RodriguezGacha's body was ripped to pieces by the grenade explosion.   However, an official coroner's report released today said bulletwounds to the head and body had killed Rodriguez Gacha, apparentlyconfirming the official version of his death.   Just hours after the drug lord's death, gunmen fatally shot apolice lieutenant in Medellin, the RCN radio network reported. RCNsaid it was not known if the slaying was related to the drug war.   Security forces tracked Rodriguez Gacha to a farm owned byEscobar near the Caribbean port of Covenas, 360 miles north ofBogota. Rodriguez Gacha and the others were wiped out in the fiercebattle that ensued, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national policechief, told a news conference in Bogota.   The New York Times reported in today's editions that police laida trap for Rodriguez Gacha about 10 days ago. The newspaper,quoting senior police officials, said Gacha's son, who had beenarrested earlier on a weapons charge, was freed so police couldfollow him to Rodriguez Gacha.   About 1,000 police and troops, supported by seven helicoptergunships, participated in the operation, Colombia's leadingnewspaper El Tiempo reported today, citing police officials as itssources. Security forces began mobilizing for the raid lateThursday, El Tiempo said.   A judge had released the trafficker's son from jail on Nov. 23after holding him for three months. Police arrested the youth onAug. 25 after raiding his hideout and discovering a weapons cache.   El Tiempo quoted a police official as saying that authoritiesacted on information provided by farmers in the area. Gen. CarlosArturo Casadiegos reportedly said the government would pay a$581,000 reward to the farmers.   None of the various versions of the events could be confirmedwith Bogota police today.   Miguel Maza Marquez, head of Colombia's investgative police,said the trafficker's death was ``a splendid Christmas present.''   Rodriguez Gacha was linked to many of the killings that haverocked Colombia and killed 199 people since Aug. 18.   Maza accused Rodriguez Gacha of ordering the killing ofpresidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a staunch opponentof the nation's drug trade and the favorite to succeed Barco.   Rodriguez Gacha also has been accused of the murders of JusticeMinister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984, of newspaper publisherGuillermo Cano in 1986 and of the leader of the leftist PatrioticUnion Party, Jaime Pardo Leal, in 1988.   Maza also blamed Rodriguez Gacha for a Dec. 8 car bomb attackthat killed 63 people outside the investigative policeheadquarters. His cartel also was suspected in the Nov. 27 bombingof a Avianca airlines jetliner near Bogota, which killed 107 people.   Among the possible results of Rodriguez Gacha's death is anincrease in violence within the cartel itself to fill the powervacumn.   Maza said the next step was to hunt down Escobar. ``We just needa little luck like we had today with Rodriguez Gacha,'' Maza said.   A former pig farmer who became a billionaire cocaine trafficker,Rodriguez Gacha owned vast stretches of land in Colombia.   He was fighting wars against the government as well as a rivalcocaine cartel from the southern city of Cali. He was also battlingother gangsters for control of the country's emerald mines.   ``This guy wants to be the Hitler of Colombia,'' a foreigndiplomat said recently.   Rodriguez Gacha also financed and directed several right-wingdeath squads. In recent years, the death squads have killedhundreds of peasants suspected of supporting left-wing guerrillas.   Officials have assumed that the drug lords are using a bombingcampaign to try to pressure the government into abandoning itsextradition policy, decreed by the president as part of the latestcrackdown.   The government has sent 10 middle-level drug suspects to theUnited States in less than four months.</TEXT></DOC>
