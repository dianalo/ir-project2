L. 100-86). 53 FR 19373 (May 27, 1988). In keeping with theBoard's view that the Act established a clear link between the time itnormally takes a check to be cleared and returned, and the time withinwhich the depositary bank \1\<NOTE/> must make the funds available to the depositor, the regulationsprovided that where a check is payable by one bank but ``payable through''\2\<NOTE/> another and sent to the payable through bank for paymentor collection, the location of the payable through bank would determinewhether a check is local or nonlocal vis-a-vis the depositary bank forthe purposes of the funds availability schedules in the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act uses the term ``receiving depository institution''to mean ``the branch of a depository institution or the proprietary ATMin which a check is first deposited.'' 12 U.S.C. 4001(20). Because theterm ``receiving depository institution'' is unique to the Act, the Boardused the term ``depositary bank,'' which, because it is used in the UniformCommercial Code (``U.C.C.'') and the Board's Regulation J (12 CFR Part210), is familiar to the banking industry.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ When a check states on its face that it is ``payable through''abank, that bank is referred to as the ``payable through bank.'' Under theU.C.C., a payable through bank is not named as the payor, but is designatedas a ``collecting bank to make presentment.'' U.C.C. 3-120. Under the Board'sRegulation J, a payable through bank is the ``paying bank.'' 12 CFR 210.2(j).Shortly after the Board issued Regulation CC, a trade association of creditunions and one credit union whose checks are payable through a nonlocalbank filed suit against the Board seeking to overturn the definition ofpaying bank to the extent that the definition included a payable throughbank where the check was drawn on a credit union. Recently, the court grantedthe plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and invalidated RegulationCC's definition of paying bank to the extent that it includes a payablethrough bank where the check is drawn on a credit union. <T3>Credit Union National Association </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>No. 88-1295 OG (D.D.C. July 28, 1988). Thecourt found that the Board's regulation was inconsistent with the Act tothe extent that it defined the payable through bank as the paying bankfor purposes of the Act's funds availability requirements.The Expedited Funds Availability Act takes effect on September 1, 1988.Regulation CC also takes effect on that date, except for those portionsof it invalidated by the Court's order. The Board has not determined whetherto appeal the court's decision. Nevertheless, in order to clarify the dutiesof banks and others with respect to checks in light of the court's order,temporary conforming amendments are being made to the definitions and tothe disclosure rules. These amendments primarily affect the classificationof checks payable by a depository institution but payable through anotherinstitution as local on nonlocal. They do not affect payable through draftspayable by nonbank payors. Further, as the payable through share draftwill carry the routing number of the payable through bank, not the creditunion, provisions in the regulation that allow a depositary bank to relyon the routing number to determine whether a check is local or nonlocalare also being amended.The interim rule permits depository institutions whose initial disclosuresare affected by the court's decision to send simple clarifying noticesin regularly scheduled mailings to existing account customers. Institutionswill be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure requirements ofthe regulation as long as the disclosures are revised by December 31, 1988.Finally, depository institutions may have operational difficulties in identifyingcredit union payable through share drafts for availability purposes. TheCommentary to andSection; 229.21(c) concerning bona fide errors is beingamended to clarify that it may be a bona fide error if a depository institutionfails to identify for availability purposes a local check that is a payablethrough draft provided that it has procedures for identifying such drafts.If the Board decides not to appeal the court's decision or if any appealis unsuccessful, the Board, after consideration of any comments receivedwith regard to the interim rule, may adopt the interim rule as a finalamendment to Regulation CC. In addition, the Board may also consider additionalrulemaking to address operational or disclosure problems that might resultbecause depositary banks and bank customers cannot rely on the routingnumber printed on a payable through draft to determine whether the checkis local or nonlocal for funds availability purposes. The Board believes that it is important to clarify these issues with anamended regulation before September 1, so that banks and other partiesaffected by Regulation CC are fully aware of their responsibilities underthe Act by the time it takes effect. Nonetheless, there is not sufficienttime for the Board to publish proposed regulations for comment before thatdate. Accordingly, the Board, for good cause, finds that the notice andpublic comment procedure normally required is impractical and contraryto the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The Board further findsthat, for the same reasons, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)to make the interim rule effective on September 1, 1988, without regardfor the 30-day period provided for in 5 U.S.C. 553(d). <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act Notice. </T3>The Board has previously submittedthe disclosure requirements and model forms and clauses of Regulation CCto the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for clearance under thePaperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and OMB's Regulations for Controlling Paperwork Burdenson the Public (5 CFR Part 1320). (OMB Docket number: 7100-0234.) The changes to Regulation CC require modifications to the disclosure requirementsand two additional model forms; these are described elsewhere in this notice.These are being submitted to OMB for clearance. Additional supporting documentsmay be obtained from the OMB clearance officer listed above. The Board estimates that the amended disclosure requirements will resultin an increase in the one-time reporting burden of Regulation CC requirementsof approximately 107,000 hours. Approximately 11,000 hours of the increasein reporting burden will be borne by state member banks and other institutionsunder the Board's jurisdiction. Any comments on the collection requirements should be sent to the OMB deskofficer listed above. OMB's usual practice is not to take any action onan information collection until at least 10 working days after notice inthe <T4>Federal Register, </T4>but occasionally the public interest requiresmore rapid action.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229 </ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System.For the reasons set out in the preamble, effective September 1, 1988, Title12, Chapter II, Part 229 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 229_AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND COLLECTION OF CHECKS </ITAG>1.

Appendix E_Commentary to Part 229 is amended as follows:   a.

For example, ifa person deposits a check into an account at a nonproprietary ATM, thebank holding the account into which the check is deposited is the depositarybank even though another bank may service the nonproprietary ATM and sendthe check for collection. (Under andSection;229.35 the depositary bank mayagree with the bank servicing the nonproprietary ATM to have the servicingbank place its own indorsement on the check as the depositary bank. Forthe purposes of Subpart C, the bank applying its indorsement as the depositarybank indorsement on the check is the depositary bank.)   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of Subpart B, a bank may act as both the depositary bankand the paying bank with respect to a check, if the check is payable bythe bank in which it was deposited, or if the check is payable by a nonbankpayor and payable through or at the bank in which it was deposited. A bankis also considered a depositary bank with respect to checks it receivesas payee. For example, a bank is a depositary bank with respect to checksit receives for loan repayment, even though these checks are not depositedin an account at the bank. Because these checks would not be ``depositedto accounts,'' they would not be subject to the availability or disclosurerequirements of Subpart B.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(r) <T3>Local check </T3>is defined as a check payable by or at a local payingbank, or, in the case of nonbank payors, payable through a local payingbank. A check payable by a local bank but payable through a nonlocal bankis a local check. Conversely, a check payable through a local bank butpayable by a nonlocal bank is a nonlocal check. Where two banks are namedon a check and neither is designated as a payable through bank, the checkis considered payable by either bank and may be considered local or nonlocaldepending on which bank it is sent to for payment. Generally, the depositarybank may rely on the routing number to determine whether a check is localor nonlocal. Appendix A includes a list or routing numbers arranged byFederal Reserve Bank Office to assist persons in determining whether ornot such a check is local. If, however, a check is payable by one bankbut payable through another bank, the routing number appearing on the checkwill be that of the payable through bank, not the paying bank. Many creditunion share drafts and certain other checks payable by banks are payablethrough other banks. In such cases, the routing number cannot be reliedon to determine whether the check is local or nonlocal. In a few cases,a payable through bank will be designated only by routing numbers and willnot be named on the check. In such cases also, the routing number may notbe relied on to determine whether the check is local or nonlocal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(s) <T3>Local paying bank </T3>is defined as a paying bank located in the samecheck processing region as the branch or proprietary ATM of the depositarybank. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Examples </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. If a check that is payable by a bank that is located in the samecheck processing region as the depositary bank is payable through a banklocated in another check processing region, the check is considered localor nonlocal depending on the location of the bank by which it is payableeven if the check is sent to the nonlocal bank for collection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The location of the depositary bank is determined by the physicallocation of the branch or proprietary ATM at which a check is deposited.If the branch of the depositary bank located in one check processing regionsends a check to the depositary bank's central facility in another checkprocessing region, and the central facility is in the same check processingregion as the paying bank, the check is still considered nonlocal. (SeeCommentary on definition of ``paying bank''.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For deposits at nonproprietary ATMs, a paying bank is a local payingbank only if the paying bank is located in the same check processing regionas the location of both the branch of the depositary bank at which theaccount is held and the nonproprietary ATM at which the check is deposited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(z) <T3>Paying bank. </T3>The regulation uses this term in lieu of the Act's``originating depository institution.'' For purposes of Subpart B, theterm ``paying bank'' includes the payor bank, the payable at bank to whicha check is sent, or, if the check is payable by a nonbank payor, the bankthrough which the check is payable and to which it is sent for paymentor collection. For purposes of Subpart C, the term includes the payablethrough bank and the bank whose routing number appears on the check regardlessof whether the check is payable by a different bank, provided that thecheck is sent for payment or collection to the payable through bank orthe bank whose routing number appears on the check. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under andSection;andSection; 229.30 and 229.36(a), a bank designated asa ``payable through bank'' or ``payable at bank'' and to which the checkis sent for payment or collection is responsible for the expedited returnof checks and notice of nonpayment requirements of Subpart C. The payablethrough or payable at bank may contract with the payor with respect toits liability in discharging these responsibilities. The Board believesthat the Act makes a clear connection between availability and the timeit takes for checks to be cleared and returned. Allowing the payable throughbank additional time to forward checks to the payor and await return orpay instructions from the payor would delay the return of these checks,increasing the risks to depositary banks. Subpart C places on payable throughand payable at banks the requirements of expeditious return based on thetime the payable through or payable at bank received the check for forwardcollection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If a check is sent for forward collection based on the routing number,the bank associated with the routing number is a paying bank for the purposesof Subpart C requirements, including notice of nonpayment, even if thecheck is not drawn by a customer of that bank or the check is fraudulent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The phrase ``and to which [the check] is sent for payment or collection''includes sending not only the physical check, but information regardingthe check under a truncation arrangement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks are also payingbanks under all subparts of the regulation with respect to checks payableby them, even though such banks are not defined as banks for purposes ofSubpart B.</ITAG>b.

The Commentary on andSection; 229.30 is amended by revising the introductoryparagraphs of (a) and the complete text of (a)(1) to read as follows: Section 229.30 Paying Bank's Responsibility for Return of Checks <ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Return of checks. </T3>This section requires a paying bank (which,for purposes of Subpart C, may include a payable through and payable atbank; see andSection; 229.2(z)) that determines not to pay a check to returnthe check expeditiously. Generally, a check is returned expeditiously ifthe return process is as fast as the forward collection process. This paragraphprovides two standards for expeditious return, the ``two-day/four-day''test, and the ``forward collection'' test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the ``two-day/four-day'' test, if a check is returned such thatit would normally be received by the depositary bank two business daysafter presentment where both the paying and depositary banks are locatedin the same check processing region or four business days after presentmentwhere the paying and depositary banks are not located in the same checkprocessing region, the check is considered returned expeditiously. In certainlimited cases, however, these times are shorter than the time it wouldnormally take a forward collection check deposited in the paying bank andpayable by the depositary bank to be collected. Therefore, the Board hasincluded a ``forward collection'' test, whereby a check is nonethelessconsidered to be returned expeditiously if the paying bank uses transportationmethods and banks for return comparable to those used for forward collectionchecks, even if the check is not received by the depositary banks withinthe two-day or four-day period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Two-day/four-day test. </T3>Under the first test, a paying bank mustreturn the check so that the check would normally be received by the depositarybank within specified times, depending on whether or not the paying anddepositary banks are located in the same check processing region. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where both banks are located in the same check processing region,a check is returned expeditiously if it is returned to the depositary bankby 4:00 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) of the second businessday after the banking day on which the check was presented to the payingbank. For example, a check presented on Monday to a paying bank must bereturned to a depositary bank located in the same check processing regionby 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday. For a paying bank that is located in a differentcheck processing region than the depositary bank, the deadline to completereturn is 4:00 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) of the fourth businessday after the banking day on which the check was presented to the payingbank. For example, a check presented to such a paying bank on Monday mustbe returned to the depositary bank by 4:00 p.m. on Friday. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This two-day/four-day test does not necessarily require actual receiptof the check by the depositary bank within these times. Rather, the payingbank must send the check so that the check would normally be received bythe depositary bank within the specified time. Thus, the paying bank isnot responsibile for unforeseeable delays in the return of the check, suchas transportation delays. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Often, returned checks will be delivered to the depositary bank togetherwith forward collection checks. Where the last day on which a check couldbe delivered to a depositary bank under this two-day/four-day test is nota banking day for the depositary bank, a returning bank might not scheduledelivery of forward collection checks to the depositary bank on that day.Further, the depositary bank may not process checks on that day. Consequently,if the last day of the time limit is not a banking day for the depositarybank, the check may be delivered to the depositary bank before the closeof the depositary bank's next banking day and the return will still beconsidered expeditious. Ordinarily, this extension of time will allow thereturned checks to be delivered with the next shipment of forward collectionchecks destined for the depositary bank. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The times specified in this two-day/four-day test are based on estimatedforward collection times, but take into account the particular difficultiesthat may be encountered in handling returned checks. It is anticipatedthat the normal process for forward collection of a check coupled withthese return requirements will frequently result in the return of checksbefore the proceeds of local and nonlocal checks, other than those coveredby andSection; 229.10(c), must be made available for withdrawal under thetemporary schedules in andSection; 229.11. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under this two-day/four-day test, no particular means of returningchecks is required, thus providing flexibility to paying banks in selectingmeans of return. The Board anticipates that paying banks will often usereturning banks (see andSection; 229.31) as their agents to return checksto depositary banks. A paying bank may rely on the availability scheduleof the returning bank it uses in determining whether the returned checkwould ``normally'' be returned within the required time under this two-day/four-daytest, unless the paying bank has reason to believe that these schedulesdo not reflect the actual time for return of a check. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>e. The Commentary on andSection; 229.31(a) is amended by revising the paragraphsup to the examples to read as follows:Section 229.31 Returning Bank's Responsibility for Return of Checks<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Return of checks.</T3> The standards for return of checks establishedby this section are similar to those for paying banks in andSection; 229.30(a).This section requires a returning bank to return a returned check expeditiouslyif it agrees to handle the returned check for expeditious return underthis paragraph. In effect, the returning bank is an agent or subagent ofthe paying bank and a subagent of the depositary bank for the purposesof returning the check. A returning bank agrees to handle a returned checkfor expeditious return to the depositary bank if it:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Publishes or distributes availability schedules for the returnof returned checks and accepts the returned check for return;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Handles a returned check for return that it did not handle forforward collection; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Otherwise agrees to handle a returned check for expeditious return.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As in the case of a paying bank, a returning bank's return of a returnedcheck is expeditious if it meets either of two tests. Under the ``two-day/four-day''test, the check must be returned so that it would normally be receivedby the depositary bank by 4:00 p.m. either two or four business days afterthe check was presented to the paying bank, depending on whether or notthe paying bank is located in the same check processing region as the depositarybank. This is the same test as the two-day/four-day test applicable topaying banks. (See Commentary to andSection; 229.30(a).) While a returningbank will not have first hand knowledge of the day on which a check waspresented to the paying bank, returning banks may, by agreement, allocatewith paying banks liability for late return based on the delays causedby each. In effect, the two-day/four day test protects all paying and returningbanks that return checks from claims that they failed to return a checkexpeditiously, where the check is returned within the specified time followingpresentment to the paying bank, or a later time as would result from unforeseendelays.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ``forward collection'' test is similar to the forward collectiontest for paying banks. Under this test, a returning bank must handle areturned check in the same manner that a similarly situated collectingbank would handle a check of similar size drawn on the depositary bankfor forward collection. A similar situated bank is a bank (other than aFederal Reserve Bank) that is of similar asset size and check handlingactivity in the same community. A bank has similar check handling activityif it handles a similar volume of checks for forward collection as theforward collection volume of the returning bank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the forward collection tests, a returning bank must accept returnedchecks, including both qualified and other returned checks (``raw returns''),at approximately the same times and process them according to the samegeneral schedules as checks handled for forward collection. Thus, a returningbank generally must process even raw returns on an overnight basis, unlessits time limit is extended by one day to convert a raw return to a qualifiedreturned check.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A returning bank may establish earlier cut-off hours for receipt ofreturned checks than for receipt of forward collection checks, but thecut-off hour for returned checks may not be earlier than 2:00 p.m. Thereturning bank also may set different sorting requirements for returnedchecks than those applicable to other checks. Thus, a returning bank mayallow itself more processing time for returns than for forward collectionchecks. All returned checks received by a cut-off hour for returned checksmust be processed and dispatched by the returning bank by the time thatit would dispatch forward collection checks received at a correspondingforward collection cut-off hour that provides for the same or faster availabilityfor checks destined for the same depositary banks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>f. The Commentary on andSection; 229.36 is amended by revising the completetext of (a) and (b) to read as follows:Section 229.36 Presentment of Checks<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Payable through and payable at checks.</T3> For purposes of SubpartC, the regulation defines a payable through or payable at bank (which couldbe designated the collectible through or collectible at bank) as a payingbank. The requirements of andSection; 229.30(a) and the notice of nonpaymentrequirements of andSection; 229.33, are imposed on a payable through or payableat bank and are based on the time of receipt of the forward collectioncheck by the payable through or payable at bank. This provision is intendedto speed the return of checks that are payable through or at a bank tothe depositary bank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Receipt at bank office or processing center.</T3> This paragraph seeksto facilitate efficient presentment of checks to promote early return ornotice of nonpayment to the depositary bank, and clarifies the law as tothe effect of presentment by routing number. This paragraph differs fromandSection; 229.39(b) because presentment of checks differs from deliveryof returned checks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The paragraph specifies four locations at which the paying bank mustaccept presentment of checks. Where the check is payable through a bankand the check is sent to that bank, the payable through bank is the payingbank for purposes of this subpart, regardless of whether the paying bankmust present the check to another bank or to a nonbank payor for payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Delivery of checks may be made, and presentment is considered tooccur, at a location (including a processing center) requested by the payingbank. This is the way most checks are presented by banks today. This provisionadopts the common law rule of a number of legal decisions that the processingcenter acts as the agent of the paying bank to accept presentment and tobegin the time for processing of the check. (See also U.C.C. 4-204(3).)If a bank designates different locations for the presentment of forwardcollection checks bearing different routing numbers, for purposes of thisparagraph it only requests presentment of checks bearing a particular routingnumber at the location designated for receipt of forward collection checksbearing that routing number.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Delivery may be made at an office of the bank associated with therouting number on the check. The office associated with the routing numberof a bank is found in a publication of Rand McNally, <T3>Key to Routing Numbers,</T3> which lists a city and state address foreach routing number. Checks are generally handled by collecting banks onthe basis of the nine-digit routing number encoded in magnetic ink (oron the basis of the fractional form routing number if the magnetic inkcharacters are obliterated) on the check, rather than the printed nameor address. The definition of a paying bank in andSection; 229.2(z) includesa bank designated by routing number, whether or not there is a name onthe check, and whether or not any name is consistent with the routing number.Where a check is payable by one bank, but payable through another, therouting number is that of the payable through bank, not that of the payorbank. As the payor bank has selected the payable through bank as the pointthrough which presentment is to be made, it is proper to treat the payablethrough bank as the paying bank for purposes of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no requirement in the regulation that the name and addresson the check agree with the address associated with the routing numberon the check. A bank may generally control the use of its routing number,just as it does the use of its name. The address associated with the routingnumber may be a processing center.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In some cases, a paying bank may have several offices in the cityassociated with the routing number. In such case, it would not be reasonableor efficient to require the presenting bank to sort the checks by morespecific branch addresses that might be printed on the checks, and to deliverthe checks to each branch. A collecting bank would normally deliver allchecks to one location. In cases where checks are delivered to a branchother than the branch on which they may be drawn, computer and couriercommunication among branches should permit the paying bank to determinequickly whether to pay the check.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. If the check specifies the name of the paying bank but no address,the bank must accept delivery at any office. Where delivery is made bya person other than a bank, or where the routing number is nor readable,delivery will be made based on the name and address of the paying bankon the check. If there is no address, delivery may be made at any officeof the paying bank. This provision is consistent with U.C.C. 3-504(2),which states that presentment for payment may be made at the place specifiedin the instrument, or, if there is none, at the place of business of theparty to pay. Thus, there is a trade-off for a paying bank between specifyinga particular address on a check to limit locations of delivery, and simplystating the name of the bank to encourage wider currency for the check.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If the check specifies the name and address of a branch or headoffice, or other location (such as a processing center), the check maybe delivered by delivery to that office or other location. If the addressis too general to identify a particular office, delivery may be made atany office consistent with the address. For example, if the address is``San Francisco, California,'' each office in San Francisco must acceptpresentment. The designation of an address on the check is generally inthe control of the paying bank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph may affect U.C.C. 3-504(2)(c) to the extent that theU.C.C. requires presentment to occur at a place specified in the instrument.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>g.
