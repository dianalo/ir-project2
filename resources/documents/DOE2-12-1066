In Nigeria increased attention focused onthe prospects of providing new energy supply options and technologiesbased on renewable sources of energy. Solar cookers, biogas and improvedwood stoves were the most commonly proposed technological changes toenergy supply systems in the rural areas of Nigeria. These energy technologieswere attractive because they had the potential to provide cheap, pollution-free,renewable or unlimited energy sources.
