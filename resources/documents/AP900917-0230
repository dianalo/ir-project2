The two sides planned a tenth day of meetings today at AndrewsAir Force Base in Maryland after a Sunday evening session ended ona fractious note.   ``Some of our members are wondering if they want an agreement,''said a Republican official familiar with the talks. ``It doesn'tlook good right now.''   For the last several days, Democrats have expressed awillingness to pare benefit programs by $125 billion from theamount needed over the next five years to keep pace with inflation.Differences over spending cuts have been considered one of thebargainers' minor squabbles.   But Sunday, Democrats told GOP bargainers that they could accepta lesser cut of about $90 billion in Medicare, agriculture andother benefit programs, said two officials who demanded anonymity.   Among the proposed reductions they rejected was a Republicanplan to save $27 billion over the next five years by boosting themonthly premium Medicare participants pay for doctors' coverage.Under the GOP proposal, people with higher incomes would pay morethan the current $28.60 monthly fee.   Reductions in benefit programs would be a crucial part of a dealbargainers are trying to shape to shrink the federal deficit by $50billion next year and $500 billion through 1995. These programs areamong the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and are oneof the prime targets on the GOP hit-list for savings.   Major problems remain over taxes.   Democrats and Republicans agree that the package should includeabout $25 billion in new levies and fees for next year.   Republicans, saying they want to spur the weakening economy,insist that a cut in the capital gains tax rate be part of thatpackage. They say cutting the tax - paid on profitable sales ofproperty - would encourage more people to sell their holdings andwould increase government revenues.   But Democrats say the proposal would simply help the wealthylower their tax burden, and they want some other tax boost for therich as a tradeoff.   The two sides tried working out a deal on taxes Sunday but gotnowhere.   Administration budget director Richard Darman proposed severalalternatives he said Republicans would accept in exchange fordropping the capital gains tax rate, said one official. Among themwas a plan eliminating certain deductions for people with adjustedgross annual incomes above $200,000.   ``There was no meeting of the minds at all,'' the official said.   Both sides agree taxes should be increased on alcoholicbeverages, luxury items such as fancy cars and electronicsequipment, energy and perhaps on cigarettes. Final details have yetto be worked out.</TEXT></DOC>
