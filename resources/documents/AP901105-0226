According to Christmas Ideas, a Better Homes and Gardenspublication, this volunteer project at Children's Hospital MedicalCenter started nine years ago and now provides much-needed garmentseach month for 100-150 premature babies, some of whom have majorhealth problems.   Volunteering to knit or crochet tiny caps and bootees or sewsmall kimono-style gowns for premature infants in children'shospitals across the country is a Christmas craft project that canbe extended year-round. Children's hospitals welcome all of thesegarments, says Susan Bales, public relations person for theNational Association of Children's Hospitals and RelatedInstitutions.   Even in a hospital's controlled environment, the tiny babiesstill need caps and bootees for warmth. Their bodies, however, aretoo small for newborn-size clothes (some of the infants weigh lessthan 1 pound).   At the Children's Hospital of Akron, nurses used cut-off tubesocks to cover the infant's heads before volunteers startedproviding garments that fit, says Marilyn McGuckin, director ofvolunteers. ``We now have a core of volunteers who regularly maketam hats, caps topped with big pom-poms, and others knitted inbright seasonal, holiday, and school colors.''   Volunteers also are needed to make small mittens to keep someinfants from pulling out stitches. In addition, doll-size kimonogowns can be sewn from soft, fire-retardant flannel materials forthe babies.   ``The babies in our neonatal intensive care unit start out sosmall, but after they progress through several stages, gain weight,and become healthier, then they go home wearing colorful caps andbootees,'' McGuckin says.   ``The caps-and-bootees program is one of many examples of whatvolunteers in a community can do to support their children'shospital,'' says William H. Considine, president of Children'sHospital Medical center of Akron. ``It requires just a smallinvestment of time and money, but it means so much to the familiesof these infants. The caps and bootees provide these families witha special keepsake of their baby's first days in this world. Theprogram also provides a human touch of kindness at a critical timefor parents and their newborn child.''   Instructions and patterns for six projects are given in the 1990issue of Christmas Ideas magazine.

Members of the Boeing group, working through the company'semployee outreach program, make the toys on their own time duringevenings and weekends. Materials, including wooden wheels, axlesand scrap wood, are donated by the company. One Seattle retireealone has produced 1,000 wooden cars in his home workshop thisyear.   The project was started in l984 by employees who asked thatfunds usually spent on a company Christmas party be used oncommunity service projects instead. Last year the group made 28,000items.</TEXT></DOC>
