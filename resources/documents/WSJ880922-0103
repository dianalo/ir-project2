But alas, there is still one hitch before the momentous U.S.-Canadian trade agreement can take effect, as it is scheduled to do at the beginning of next year. A group of reactionaries holed up in the Canadian Senate in Ottawa is fighting a last-ditch battle to derail the agreement.    We doubt that they will succeed. At this point, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose popularity has been rising as the trade agreement has moved toward reality, seems likely to take the issue to the Canadian people. After some rocky times politically over the past 17 months, polls now show him with something like a 55% support level. So he has a good chance to successfully call the bluff of his Senate opponents.    The trade agreement now has been resoundingly endorsed by both national leaders and every elective body on both sides of the border. The U.S. Senate gave it overwhelming approval Monday. Both the U.S. and Canadian houses also gave it strong votes. But the Canadian Senate is not elective. Its members are &quot;life&quot; appointees, not required to retire until they are 75. For that reason it is controlled by the Liberal Party, which dominated government, with one brief interruption, for years before Mr. Mulroney's conservative sweep in September 1984. Senate Liberals receive support from New Democrats, the furthest left of the three major parties.    The positions of these senators can be described as reactionary because they hark back to the era when the Liberals were trying to fence off Canada, culturally and economically, from its big neighbor. This effort employed a strident nationalistic rhetoric and self-destructive policies such as controls on energy exports from Canada and foreign investment in Canada. The U.S. economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s wasn't in great shape either but Canada suffered worse. After his victory, Prime Minister Mulroney reopened Canada to foreign investment and reduced other controls, with the result that it has been perhaps the fastest-growing industrial state these past four years.    The trade talks Mr. Mulroney and President Reagan set in motion shortly after Mr. Mulroney's victory were designed to further expand the flow of capital and commerce between the two countries, which already represents the largest bilateral trade flow in the world. Total trade this year is running some 10% over a year earlier and could exceed $280 billion.    Canadians can only benefit from the improved access they will have to the huge U.S. market and to U.S. capital. There is a natural synergy between the two countries. Canada is rich in natural resources; the U.S. is a plentiful source of capital for developing those resources. Both countries are rich in human potential. In short, the trade agreement will provide an economic boost on both sides of the border, and could perhaps pave the way for a broader free-trade zone that would eventually encompass Mexico and other Hispanic nations of the hemisphere. That would be a major political and economic achievement, not unlike the one currently moving toward a culmination in Europe.    The Canadian reactionaries make much of the idea that Canada, as a lightly populated nation, is always in danger of being swallowed up, economically and culturally, by the United States. This is mostly nonsense, as are similar arguments employed by protectionist forces in the United States when they argue for policies that keep out the &quot;foreigners.&quot; Canada's culture, which is in some sense even more diversified than that of the U.S., shows no signs of damage from proximity to the U.S. And so far as economics are concerned there is no such thing as a prosperous closed society. Ask the Albanians or the Burmese.    One thing Liberal leader John Turner may succeed in doing is to force Mr. Mulroney to call an election at a time when he has been weakened by other problems having nothing to do with the trade agreement. Thus, even with a victory, Mr. Mulroney would undoubtedly lose some of his huge majority, 208 seats in a 285-seat house. In other words, some of what is going on here is simply old-fashioned political maneuvering. But it is dangerous maneuvering from the point of view of Canada's future. Someone should give that message to the ancients who control Canada's version of a House of Lords. </TEXT></DOC>
