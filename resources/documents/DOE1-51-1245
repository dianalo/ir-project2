The distortion,which has a shift-variant property, is caused by a geometrical structureof the collimator. We developed a correction method considering thisproperty. In this method, the correction is performed in the frequencydomain. The conception of the correction method is that the blurringfunction is defined at the circular position of the polar coordinatein the frequency domain, the cyclic deconvolution of projection datawith the shift-variant blurring function is effective to remove the distortion.In this paper, we considered the effect of aperture angle and that ofdistance between the surface of the gamma camera and the rotational centerof the gamma camera. Moreover the applicability to clinical studies wasdiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
