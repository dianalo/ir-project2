Describes a studyconducted with the aim of optimizing stock holdings and shows how theprinciples of statistical analysis can be applied to the management ofmaintenance stocks. Using regression analysis of spare part consumption,a probability calculation is made involving Poisson's normal, negativeand gamma distribution formulae. A practical application of maintenancestock management is illustrated using as a subject the Dobro Selo surfacecoal mine and a detailed description of a simplified computation methodapplicable in this case is described. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
