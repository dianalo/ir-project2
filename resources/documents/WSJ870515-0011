Union local presidents voted 16-14 to reject the proposed pact, citing provisions that would have eliminated 511 jobs at LTV, the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, and combined certain trade and craft positions in an effort to reduce costs.    Some of the presidents also said they objected to the proposed contract because they believed LTV managers haven't shouldered as much financial sacrifice as the company's 23,000 steelworkers. Negotiators had worked sporadically on the pact most of the year.    Any new contract will supersede a concessionary accord reached last April. The pact that was rejected wouldn't have altered the wage levels set by the earlier agreement, which reduced wages and benefits an average of $3.15 an hour.    Only three months after last year's contract negotiations, LTV filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The move enabled it to dump $2.3 billion in unfunded pension obligations on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government-chartered insurer of private pension plans.    After LTV's bankruptcy-law filing, union negotiators agreed to reopen the contract, and other steelmakers expressed concern that LTV might wrest deep laborcost savings, pressuring them to ask the union to renegotiate their agreements as well. Though LTV's bankruptcy-law proceeding has enabled it to cut costs drastically -- mainly by shedding pension liabilities -- union negotiators have taken a hard stance against further wage cuts.    Both union and LTV officials indicated they expect to reassess their positions and return to the bargaining table. Though LTV could ask a federal bankruptcy court to void the existing pact, such a move isn't viewed as likely now.    LTV estimated that the proposed new contract would have saved it about $50 million annually. The pact also would have restored about 92% of the retirement income lost by LTV retirees when the company's pension plans were terminated. </TEXT></DOC>
