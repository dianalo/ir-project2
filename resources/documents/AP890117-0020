Since the November election, the once-spotlighted Quayle hasdeliberately kept a low profile while President-elect Bush remainedat center stage with personnel and policy pronouncements.   Until the end of last week, the former Indiana senator eschewedinterviews, rebuffing reporters' attempts to learn what specificgoals or projects he has in mind for his vice presidential tenure.His standard reply is that he wants to do Bush's bidding and becomea close adviser to the president.   He told The Washington Post, however, in an interview publishedSunday, that he plans ``crusades'' in such areas as education,anti-drug and crime-fighting efforts, that could include personalvisits to crime victims, drug users or school dropouts.   Both Quayle and Bush have said they want to build an easy-accessrelationship of the type Bush had with President Reagan. Bush metprivately with the president once a week and said that was generallythe opportunity he used to relay his views and advice.   But how much Bush might rely on Quayle's advice is an openquestion.   His press secretary, David Beckwith, summed up the situation thisway: ``Quayle comes to the job with certain strengths but he alsocomes to learn and to work hard. It's not like he's 65 years old andhas a wealth of experience across the board like Bush had. On theother hand, he has a certain perspective that I think Bush values.''   Quayle will be chairman of the National Space Council and wantsto spend several hours a week on Capitol Hill, working as anadministration advocate with his former colleagues.   The energetic 41-year-old politician also is expected to workwith the Republican National Committee, making the rounds of thespeaker circuit, raising money and courting supporters.   Although a favorite of conservatives, Quayle has said he does notintend to be a mouthpiece for their interests with the more moderateBush. RNC spokesman Mark Goodin contended that Quayle appeals to aRepublican mainstream constituency beyond those who share hisconservative ideology.   Goodin noted that Quayle managed to raise several million dollarsfor the party through high-roller campaign events after weatheringthe spate of negative publicity following his nomination.   Quayle's focus in Congress was on national defense, as a memberof the Senate Armed Services Committee, and on job issues stemmingfrom his co-authorship of job-training legislation.   But Quayle spent most of the post-election period selecting hisstaff and meeting privately with officials and interest groups.   Aides reject any notion that the Bush team wanted to keep Quayleunder wraps, but say Quayle himself set the low profile during theperiod when he wanted to establish his relationship with Bush.   ``We've been sensitive to not try and handle him,'' said Bushtransition communications director Dave Demarest.   Aides acknowledge that Quayle has an image problem stemming fromthe post-Republican convention furor over his National Guard serviceand poor grades in school. Opinion polls have shown that mostAmericans are doubtful about Quayle's competence to assume thepresidency should anything happen to Bush.   Quayle's image isn't helped by the jokes perpetuated not only bylate-night TV comedians, but by fellow Republicans. One was toldrecently by a close associate of President Reagan.   Bush plans to issue Quayle bonds, the joke goes. ``There's noprinciple, no interest and they never mature.''   When President Reagan first took office in 1981, he assigned Bushto head a commission on deregulating the government. With thatcommission's work mostly finished, Quayle apparently won't take onanything similar.   In his campaign, Bush initially said he would want his vicepresident to head administration anti-drug efforts, but Quayle wasedged out of that responsibility by congressional legislationcreating a separate cabinet-level ``drug czar'' post.   Bush last week named former Education Secretary William Bennettto the job.</TEXT></DOC>
