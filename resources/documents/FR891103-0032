The statute requires Federalagencies to follow certain procedures to recover penalties, and assessmentsagainst persons who file false claims or statements. It provides for designatedinvestigative and reviewing officials, an administrative hearing process,and an agency appeal procedure with limited judicial review. The President'sCouncil on Integrity and Efficiency developed draft model regulations inorder to facilitate and promote uniformity in implementing the new procedure.The State Department, with minor variations, has adopted the model regulations.Consistent with the statute's requirements, the Department's proposed regulationsprovide that the Office of Inspector General will act as the InvestigatingOfficial; the Comptroller of the Department will act as Reviewing Official;an administrative law judge will be the Presiding Official; and the DeputySecretary or his designee will act as Authority Head on appeals. The newadministrative process should serve to deter fraud in cases where costsof litigation formerly made it uneconomical to press such claims, and shouldgive the Department an effective remedy against persons submitting falseclaims to the Department.The proposed rules would have no direct effect on the economy, or on Federalor State expenditures, and thus do not constitute a ``major rule'' withinthe meaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291. Consequently, wehave concluded that an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required.Nor do the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)apply. The proposed rules contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1978, and fallwithin the exceptions to coverage.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 35</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Fraud, Penalties.Accordingly, title 22, chapter I of the Code of Federal Regulations isproposed to be amended to add part 35 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 35_PROGRAM FRAUD CIVIL REMEDIES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.1 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.3 Basis for civil penalties and assessments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.4 Investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.5 Review by the reviewing official.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.6 Prerequisites for issuing a complaint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.7 Complaint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.8 Service of complaint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.9 Answer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.10 Default upon failure to file an answer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.11 Referral of complaint and answer to the ALJ.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.12 Notice of hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.13 Parties to the hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.14 Separation of functions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.15 Ex parte contacts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.16 Disqualification of reviewing official or ALJ.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.17 Rights of parties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.18 Authority of the ALJ.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.19 Prehearing conferences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.20 Disclosure of documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.21 Discovery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.22 Exchange of witness lists, statements and exhibits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.23 Subpoenas for attendance at hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.24 Protective order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.25 Fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.26 Form, filing and service of papers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.27 Computation of time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.28 Motions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.29 Sanctions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.30 The hearing and burden of proof.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.31 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.32 Location of hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.33 Witnesses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.34 Evidence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.35 The record.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.36 Post-hearing briefs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.37 Initial decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.38 Reconsideration of initial decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.39 Appeal to authority head.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.40 Stays ordered by the Department of Justice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.41 Stay pending appeal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.42 Judicial review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.43 Collection of civil penalties and assessments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.44 Right to administrative offset.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.45 Deposit in Treasury of United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.46 Compromise or settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">35.47 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>31 U.S.C. 3801-3812.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Basis.</T3> This part implements the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Actof 1986, Pub.
