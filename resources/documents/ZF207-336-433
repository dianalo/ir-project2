(TelecommunicationInsights) (technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hargadon, Thomas J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Ten years ago, telecommunications involved voice-grade service,provided by ATandamp;T, with some data communications provided at300-1200 baud over leased lines or value-added networks.andP;  Now,there are alternatives to ATandamp;T, including private networks.andO;Modems are faster and less expensive.andP;  A move toward higherbandwith is clear in local area networks (LANs): ten years, ago,128Kbps was adequate; figures ranging between 1Mbps and 10Mbps arenow common.andP;  A fusion of telecommunications transmission and localarea networks (LANs) is expected, in combinations such as campusnetworks and metropolitan area networks (MANs), with bandwidthsbetween 100Mbps and 600Mbps.andP;  The technology for such bandwiths isfiber optics.andP;  Bell operating companies favor ISDN, with acapacity of only 156Kbps.andP;  A possibility: an 'invidiousdistinction' might develop between heavy users and others.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     NetworksISDNTrendsBandwidthData Transfer RateTelecommunicationsCommunications Service SuppliersFiber Optics.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
