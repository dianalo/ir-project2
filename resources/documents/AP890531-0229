Despite the advent of the credit card and bank teller machinenetworks, reported sales of travelers checks keep rising steadily,98 years after an employee of American Express Co. named MarcellusBerry hit on the idea.   American Express, which remains the best-known travelers checkpurveyor, says its worldwide sales of the checks increased from$13.8 billion in 1983 to $21.1 billion last year.   The Credit Union National Association, a trade group, says itssales of checks to credit unions jumped more than 50 percent in1988.   CUNA attributes this growth to a booming travel and vacationmarket at just about all age levels of the population, from theyoungest of the baby boomers to the rapidly growing ranks of olderAmericans.   The appeal of travelers checks, of course, is that they serve asa kind of marked money _ nearly as handy as cash, but protected,unlike cash, from the hazards of theft or loss.   In fact, says the CUNA, less than 1 percent of the travelers'checks that are issued become the subject of refund claims.   Nevertheless, if you are going to take the trouble of gettingthem for the protection they offer, financial advisers say, itmakes sense to handle them properly and wisely.   First of all, they suggest, familiarize yourself beforehand withthe procedure for obtaining a refund in the places you plan tovisit.   Then, you need a plan for safe, separate storage during the tripof the documents that show what checks you have bought and theirserial numbers.   Among the travel safety tips it offers, American Expressrecommends drawing up in duplicate a list of the travelers checksyou will be carrying, along with numbers of such other things ascredit cards, passports and insurance policies.   ``Keep one copy with you and leave the other at home with afriend or business associate,'' the company says. ``It will speedreplacement or recovery in case of theft or loss.''   ``Each time you cash a traveler's check, write down the amountand number of the check, the place you cashed it and the time anddate,'' it adds. That way, you will know at any time the amountsand numbers of checks that still may be lost or stolen.   All this may sound like a lot of trouble to take, more than alot of people would actually bother with. After all, you are goingon a vacation, not to an accounting convention.   But the whole idea of travelers checks is security, against lossof your money and against the disruption of your trip.   Few institutions that sell travelers checks charge onerous feesfor them. If you're inclined to shop around, however, you may wellfind a place where they are available more cheaply.   At the end of a trip, it makes sense to cash in any remainingchecks quickly to put the money to use elsewhere.   A few years back, one firm suggested in its advertising that youkeep one or two unused checks in your wallet more or lesspermanently as a sort of emergency reserve.   Whether that appeals to you or not, you should bear in mind thatthe suggestion does not come from a disinterested source. Companiesthat make travelers checks profit from the ``float,'' earninginvestment returns on your money between the time you buy atravelers check and the time you spend it.   So hanging on to an old travelers check is pretty much the samething as putting it into a savings account that pays no interest atall.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday June 1</NOTE></DOC>
