<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-1138 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Chernobyl reactor accident certainly reduced the acceptance of nuclearenergy, by the general public in the FRG, deteriorating its image from'acceptable and to a certain extent useful' to 'unfortunately not yetreplaceable'. This last opinion, however, seems to be the current, realisticjudgement of nuclear technology by the public, so that one can say thatnuclear technology is again accepted for a transitional period, for reasonsof economic and environmental policies. On the international level, theChernobyl accident did not essentially affect the acceptance or assessmentof nuclear energy. The General Assembly of the UN unanimously confirmedthe vital importance of nuclear energy within the global energy supplysystem. So far, no country has made any decisive change in its nuclearpolicy. The article in hand investigates the political situation in theFRG that might jeopardize the consensus between coal and nuclear energy.It also discusses the engineered safety of German nuclear power plants,uranium enrichment, reprocessing, ultimate nuclear waste disposal, theHanau nuclear industries, the THTR-300 commissioning experience, andthe obstacles still delaying progress with the SNR-300, as well as novelapproaches and agreements on the level of international cooperation inthe nuclear energy sector.
