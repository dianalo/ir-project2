Beginning at least one year before the Red Army withdrew inFebruary 1989, the operation has brought hundreds of thousands oftons of commodities to Afghanistan, the state-run press hasreported.   Another $3 billion in military aid, including advanced weapons,is supplied annually, Eastern European diplomats said.   The United States gives the anti-government guerrillas anestimated $500 million worth of arms a year.   ``If we didn't have food from the Soviet Union, we wouldstarve,'' says Massuma Esmaty Wardak, president of the AfghanistanWomen's Council. ``We have no one else to turn to.''   The massive operation indicates the commitment Moscow has madeto the Kabul government, which came to power in a bloody Communistcoup in 1978. Soviet troops arrived the following year to prop upthe faltering Marxist regime.   After the Red Army ended its decade-long military interventionin February, Western diplomats predicted a quick victory for theguerrillas. But Kabul didn't fall.   The rebels failed to unite, and Soviet aid gave the governmentthe firepower and food it needed.   ``The West underestimated the Soviet commitment. Everyonethought the Red Army was retreating and had lost the war,'' saidone diplomat, who has been counting transport planes and trucks forthe past nine months. ``Only now do we know how serious theRussians really were.''   For their aid, the Soviets get a pliant government on itssouthern border that helps offset neighboring Iran's Islamicfundamentalism and Pakistan's pro-Americanism.   In late October, the Daily Payam, official organ of the rulingPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, published an unusuallydetailed account of Soviet aid.   From February to August, it said, 266,543 metric tons of Sovietgoods crossed through the border town of Hayratan.   Among the goods, more than 40,000 tons of fuel, 82,000 tons ofwheat, 1,000 tons of cooking oil, 900 tons of sugar and 540 tons offlour rolled into Afghanistan on more than 21,000 Soviet trucks,the newspaper said.   The United Nations says another 220,000 tons of Soviet-suppliedflour, some of it purchased from the United States and Australia,is in the pipeline.   Also since February, 168,750 tons of goods have arrived in Kabulaboard 6,750 Soviet transport planes, diplomats said.   Diplomats estimated that until recently the airlift contained 75percent weapons and 25 percent food. But Afghan officialsreportedly have asked that the food portion be raised to 40 percentin view of the coming winter and the country's serioustransportation problems, caused by war, bad roads and harsh weather.   To help with this problem, the Soviets recently gave Kabul 2,200heavy duty trucks, the state-run Bakhtar news agency reported lastmonth. Tens of thousands of vehicles had already been left behindby the Red Army when it pulled out.   Diplomats said the duration and size of the operation make itone of the biggest aid programs in Soviet history, rivaled only bySoviet aid to Cuba and Vietnam.   ``The costs are tremendous and we believe that not even Moscowknows how much it is paying,'' said one high-ranking Asian diplomatwhose country is friendly with both Moscow and Kabul.   In the military sphere, diplomats in Kabul and Islamabad saythat since 1988, about $200 million to $300 million in weapons havebeen crossing the Soviet border each month.   Diplomats from two Eastern European countries who provided the$3 billion annual estimate said Moscow has promised to provideAfghanistan with two advanced weapons: the Scud-500, an updatedversion of the medium-range missiles already supplied to Kabul, andthe MiG-29, an advanced combat jet. The Soviets already have givenAfghanistan more than 150 planes for its air force, mostly MiG-21fighters.   Afghanistan also has received air defense rockets, according tothe April 29 edition of the state-run Kabul Times, which carried aphotograph of the weapons on its front page.   Some diplomats challenged attempts to estimate the value ofSoviet military aid because accounting methods vary from country tocountry.   Diplomats in Kabul and Pakistan say Afghanistan has fired 1,000Scud missiles in the past year at the rebels. Each rocket costsabout $1 million on the arms market, bringing the Scuds' total costto $1 billion.   But they contend the missiles are valueless because Moscowprobably would have destroyed the weapons, which were orginallybuilt to carry nuclear warheads and use 1960s technology.   In addition to aid, the Soviet Union occupies a commandingposition in Afghanistan's economy.   Soviet economic ties account for 60 percent of Afghanistan'sstate budget and 75 percent of its industrial output, the DailyPayam said in November.   Soviet assistance is used in the production of 100 percent ofAfghanistan's natural gas, 100 percent of its chemical fertilizerand 60 percent of its electricity, the Payam said.   Since the 1954 signing of the first Afghan-Soviet long termcredit agreement, Moscow has had close economic ties with Kabul.Soviet aid built housing, roads and bridges, and generated power.In 1956, the two nations signed an agreement for the training andmodernization of Afghanistan's armed forces. The military led theCommunist revolution in 1978.   Since the Soviet intervention, Afghanistan has becomeincreasingly isolated economically.   The U.S.-backed rebels have cut the road to Pakistan, whichcarried flour and cooking oil. Trade with Iran is minimal. Amongthe industrialized nations only Japan, which exports about $100million a year, has substantial economic ties.</TEXT></DOC>
