It will happen the night of July 21 during the acceptance speech of the party's presidential nominee. He will say something like this:    &quot;And I promise the American people: as president of the United States, I will never trade arms for hostages.&quot;    It will rattle the rafters at the Omni arena in Atlanta.    Which is only to suggest that Ronald Reagan will have to live with the legacy of the Iran-Contra affair during the remaining 18 months of his presidency and that anyone the Republican Party nominates to succeed him will have to scramble hard during the campaign to deal with what happened.    It's a big issue now and it looks as if it's going to remain a big issue.    Even Patrick Buchanan, former White House communications director and firm defender of Mr. Reagan, acknowledges that the president &quot;took a permanent hit from selling the arms to Iran.&quot;    &quot;Ronald Reagan,&quot; says John Deardourff, the Republican strategist, &quot;is going to end up with a very big black eye and there is no possibility he can do anything about it.&quot;    But there is one light in all this Republican darkness. Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North may have affected public opinion on the question of supplying military aid to the Contras, making it more likely that Congress will vote for additional money.    The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last week first showed a significant jump in support for the Contras after Col. North's initial testimony; other polls subsequently have shown similar shifts in public sentiment.    &quot;There is a resurgence of support for Contra aid,&quot; says Rep. Buddy MacKay (D., Fla.), who opposes the assistance. &quot;Ollie North has reinvigorated the emotional aspects of Contra aid.&quot; Some experts believe this could prove ephemeral, however.    But while it now seems clear that the president has escaped the most severe potential consequence of impeachment, he and his administration have lost the advantage that kept them a step or two in front of the Democrats throughout the first six years of his tenure.    As a result of the Iran-Contra affair, says Peter Hart, the Democratic poll taker, &quot;the president has come down from a high plateau to a low plateau, and he'll not go back up.&quot;    The White House puts a brave face on it.    &quot;I think we feel pretty good about where we're coming out, compared to where we went in,&quot; says White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He claims that one advantage that came out of the hearings &quot;is that Congress has looked incredibly bad.&quot;    The president now is planning to take the offensive by vetoing major spending bills and pushing for an arms-control accord. But what could really reinvigorate Ronald Reagan is attacking Democrats as being weak in the face of a communist threat in Central America if they don't support more aid for the Contras.    Mr. Fitzwater dismisses polls that show people don't believe the president is telling the truth about what happened and don't believe he is doing a good job in handling the situation.    In fact, Mr. Maslin, the Democratic poll taker, says, &quot;Mr. Reagan gets it coming and going. People are upset about selling arms for hostages. They criticize the president if he did know about that. And if he didn't know about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to support the Contras in Nicaragua, they criticize him for that.&quot;    Mr. Deardourff, the Republican strategist, is especially pessimistic. &quot;The president's confidence level continues to decline,&quot; he says. &quot;People think Reagan knows more than he's telling -- or that he's hopelessly out of touch. And you get the feeling he's slipping physically. His voice is fading and his body language is less aggressive. He's running out of gas.&quot;    Republican candidates will try to separate themselves from the Iran-Contra affair, an especially daunting task for Vice President George Bush. They may even want to tread warily in the way they treat today's hero, Col. North. &quot;They'd be taking a chance if they went around taking his side,&quot; Mr. Deardourff says. &quot;There's still a lot of things we don't know.&quot;    Anyway, some strategists believe, Col. North will fade as a national hero as time marches on. To some, the analogy is Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who, after being fired by President Truman, came home from Korea to deliver a passionate speech to a joint session of Congress. Old soldiers never die, he said, they just fade away. And fade away he did.    Robert Teeter, a Republican poll taker whose clients include Mr. Bush, thinks the Iran-Contra affair may fade away, too. &quot;When it's over,&quot; he says, &quot;it's over.&quot; His big problem is he isn't sure when it will be over.    The best bet for GOP candidates, says Mr. Deardourff, &quot;is to pick and choose from those items the president still gets good marks for -- interest rates, low inflation, low unemployment.&quot; The Reagan years have been good times, relatively speaking, and that's going to be good for Republicans, as long as the good times roll.    For the Democrats, the Iran-Contra affair means foreign policy may turn out to be a major issue in 1988. And that could be a mixed blessing.    First of all, none of the seven Democratic candidates have much experience in the conduct of foreign affairs. The Rev. Jesse Jackson might argue he is at the head of the class. After all, he can point to the time in January 1984 when he flew into Damascus and rescued Navy Lt. Robert Goodman Jr.    &quot;The problem isn't that these Democratic candidates are weak on foreign-policy credentials,&quot; says Mr. Deardourff. &quot;They're weak on credentials, period.&quot;    In 1988, says Mr. Hart, the Democratic poll taker, &quot;Democrats will need a strong national-defense component in their platform and on their ticket. It's not enough for Democrats to say we're against the Republicans for what they've done. It's now up to the Democrats to say, here is where we stand.&quot;    Mr. Maslin echoes the thought. &quot;Democrats can say the defense budget should be cut and that aid to the Contras is a misguided policy. But it should be clear to all of them by now that they need some independent means to demonstrate they can be trusted with the nation's defense.&quot;    ---   'Do you approve or disapprove of the Reagan administration's support of the rebels in Nicaragua?'
