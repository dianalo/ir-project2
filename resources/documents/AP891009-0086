Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands told 800 delegates andobservers at a 10-day session of the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species that supporters of the ivory quotasystem ``must admit that it has failed to control the illegal ivorytrade.''   Bernhard, president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, warneddelegates of alarming census reports. ``You must give benefit ofthe doubt to the survival of the species,'' he said.   The convention issued an infractions report detailing howAfrican countries, especially Zaire and Gabon, had floutednon-ivory wildlife trade restrictions.   The report also singled out Argentina, Spain, Japan andThailand, among others, for failing to comply with conventionregulations on other species. It mentioned only the most flagrantabuses, it said, indicating widespread problems in policinginternational trade.   A separate report dealt with ivory, the heart of the wildlifetrade issue.   Delegates from 103 convention nations must decide whether toleave elephants under their present designation as threatenedspecies or list them as an endangered species, which would force aban on ivory trade.   Ivory fetches more than $150 a pound on world markets.   The United States, Canada and the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity halted imports in June.   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana argue that carefulmanagement has increased their elephant herds and entitles them tosell tusks to finance their game reserves. Zimbabwe says it earns$9 million a year by selling ivory from herds estimated at 52,000.   But East African states say herds have been reducedcontinent-wide from 1.3 million in a decade to just more than600,000 and can only be protected by a ban that applies to theentire continent.   In July, Kenya burned 2,500 poached ivory tusks worth $3 millionto draw attention to the slaughter of elephants across thecontinent. Kenya's population had declined from 65,000 in the 1970sto about 17,000 today.   Environmentalists say poachers kill at least 70,000 elephants ayear and that poorer nations such as Kenya and do not have theresources to stop well-armed poachers, many of whom come fromneighboring countries.   Connie Harriman, a U.S. assistant secretary of the interior andhead of the American delegation, said a partial ban would ``createa loophole which would allow continued illegal trade. We have noflexibility.''   Other delegates agreed, suggesting that Eastern Africa mightmuster the required two-thirds majority to change the elephants'status to endangered.   But others rallied around Southern Africa. ``We must respect theAfricans' wishes,'' said Kiyohiko Arafune of the Japanesedelegation, which favors limited ivory trade.   Convention Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe suggested a splitlisting that would ban trade where elephant populations are at riskbut allow quotas for South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.   The World Wide Fund for Nature and the International Union forthe Conservation of Nature backed a ban but left room for maneuver.   ``We would support a split listing with a moratorium to gaintime,'' said Tom Milliken of TRAFFIC, an enforcement groupassociated with the conservation groups. ``The alternative is toback Southern Africa to the wall, so they file reservations andopen the door to abuse.''   The convention's rulings are non-legally binding agreements thatrely on international pressure for enforcement. Convention membersare allowed to file a so-called reservation to bypass guidelinesfor an individual species.   The position of the conservation groups was met by anger from arange of other environmentalist groups, mostly from the UnitedStates, that have lobbied for an immediate ban.   ``We should stand together on what is necessary and letgovernments do the compromising,'' said Sue Lieberman of the HumaneSociety of the United States. ``It's incredible when official U.S.and British positions are stronger than some environmentalists'.''   Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Davis said: ``The compromiseapproach has meant the death of hundreds of thousands of Africanelephants. ``Only a total ban with a really concerted effort toshut down the markets can save the elephants.''   Simon Lyster, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's 19-persondelegation, said: ``Our objective is a total ban but we are notwedded to the mechanism.''   He blamed individual nations for a gross failure to enforceregulation and said the convention lacked the resources to fulfillits mandate. Lyster also said that even a total ban would not beenough.   ``We must make the wearing of ivory, using of ivory, as sociallyunacceptable as wearing a cheetah-skin coat,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
