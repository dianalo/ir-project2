A two-partseries, ``Bad Times On The Bayou,'' examines the depression and thesocial revolution taking place in Louisiana. First, the economicwoes of what was once one of the nation's richest states.</TEXT><NOTE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One day last year, state government was withinan hour of not making the payroll. One day in the future, economistswarn, this city could be knocking on bankruptcy's door. Bond ratingsare just one notch above junk bonds.   Times are hard in Louisiana.   Charity hospital clinics overflow because the state can't affordenough doctors to go around. Windows in City Hall remain cracked andunrepaired. Children go to school in packed classrooms withoutmodern teaching aids such as computers. One town has to turn offstreet lights to save money.   ``We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state ofexcellence,'' said Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine.``We've become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state.''   Times are hard in Louisiana.   An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; somehave been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago. Manyof the state's skilled workers have fled to healthier regions. Inall, close to 100,000 jobs have been lost.   Even worse, antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff publicofficials' efforts to attract new business and raise the moneyneeded to improve education, health care and the economy.   French-Cajun optimism, the let-the-good-times-roll attitude thatdrank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts,seems to be fading. People have been packing up and moving out. Nohope of another oil boom, they say. No hope.   ``We seem to find people with short fuses lately,'' said HubertChiasson, the manager of New Orleans' largest unemployment office.``Do I really see any signs of improvement? No, I really don't.''   Times are hard in Louisiana.   The state was forced to borrow $1.3 billion to cover its debt,and another $1.2 billion to bail out its insolvent unemploymentinsurance fund. About 10 percent of the state tax collections now goto pay interest on debt.   Sales taxes are already highest in the nation _ 9 percent in NewOrleans. Businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the stateout.   ``It's a spiral _ you can't get new business, so you can't employall the people who need jobs,'' said Tim Ryan, director of businessand economic research at the University of New Orleans. ``Thatdoesn't mean we will spiral down any further, but there will be nonew growth.''   In fact, there are indicators that the economy has bottomed outafter two years of depression. There are no signs of improvement,however.   The price of oil began its crash in 1984, and two years later aleading state business organization proclaimed that Louisiana'srecession had become a depression. Unemployment reached 14.5 percentin January 1987. The latest figure is about 10 percent _ twice thenational average.   Despite its abundance of resources, waterway location andreputation for good food and good times, the state proved to beill-prepared for the day when the oil ``gravy train'' stopped,economists said.   The taxing structure dates back to the days of populist HueyLong, who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at theexpense of business. Most homes are exempt from property taxes; manystate services are offered at unusually low rates, such as $3 a yearfor an automobile license plate.   Gov. Buddy Roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, buthis first attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he'lltry again, and win, because the future of the state depends on it.   ``We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's aloser. We're trying to reverse it,'' Roemer said.   The state has a huge group _ estimated at 30,000 _ of out-of-workoil workers with no employable skills. Most dropped out of schoolfor the lure of big money on oil rigs. Many don't even have themoney now to pack up and move out.   ``How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?''asks Eugene Schreiber, director of New Orleans' World Trade Centerand chairman of a governor's task force on labor. ``We have to trainand develop our workers.''   New Orleans has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that themayor said the only services left to cut were courts and schoolcrossing guards. The city has lost $100 million in revenue _ a fullone-third of its entire budget _ since oil prices crashed.   ``The current budget is in a crisis,'' Mayor Sidney Barthelemysaid in an interview before opting for an $8-per-household ``publicsafety fee'' and slashing court funding from $25 million to $15million, with layoffs in the district attorney's office.   But Louisiana law says the City Council can't raise propertytaxes without a general election, and besides, only 15 percent ofthe homeowners in New Orleans pay property taxes, by law.   The City Council can't raise the sales tax, by law. It can'tcreate an income tax, by law.   All Barthelemy says he can do is raise fees, such as slapping asurcharge on water bills for ``public safety.''   The city of Shreveport, in the northern part of the state,balanced its budget by laying off 115 Sanitation Department workers,abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewerrates 25 percent.   Houma, an oil town near the Gulf of Mexico, found times were sohard that 3,000 street lights had to be turned off to save money.   ``Business has never been as bad,'' said Dan Catlett, owner ofthe Houma Pawn Shop. ``I can't see any improvement, and I'm usuallythe first to tell.''   New Orleans school Supt. Everett Williams has had to cope withall the problems of a large, urban school system while his budgethas been slashed. The state cut back on its funding, so did thefederal government, and the city. He's laid off 300 employees. Histeacher-pupil ratio has climbed to 29-to-1 in elementary schools.His counselor-to-pupil ratio is 450-to-1.   Voters approved a bond package to help the schools, but it's notenough. This year, the schools are operating with $30 million in``bridge funding'' from the state. Williams is worried he'll losethat money next year.   That could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budgetso poor ``I really couldn't operate the school district.''   Williams, like Mayor Barthelemy, Gov. Roemer, economists andbusiness leaders, says the key to the future will be reshaping thetax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs fromlocal governments. Despite the element of futility, they see goodtimes ahead.   ``I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive,'' Williamssaid.   The governor added, ``We are going to turn this state around.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
