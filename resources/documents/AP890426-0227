Iran's relations with Moscow also are warming and thefundamentalist Moslem regime is turning to the Soviet blocincreasingly for arms, apparently paying for tanks, artillery andother weapons with crude oil.   ``Strengthening the Islamic Republic's defense capabilities isone of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period,''President Ali Khamenei told senior military commanders at a recentconference.   Both belligerents have large forces along the cease-fire lineand, with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began,Iran's rapid buildup is causing concern among Western officials.   ``It's very worrisome. They're rebuilding much faster than weexpected,'' a senior official of the U.S. Defense Department toldThe Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.   Iraq also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces,and both countries have been developing their own arms industries,including missile production, since the cease-fire Aug. 20.   Earlier this month, the Tehran daily Payam e-Enqelab said themissile firepower of the Revolutionary Guards Corps will ``increasefive-fold in the near future'' using domestically produced weaponswith ranges of up to 100 miles.   The American source said of the Iranian rearmament program: ``Itappears they're talking in the range of $20 billion over the next4-5 years. They've got serious economic problems and yet they'respending this kind of money on rebuilding their military. Thequestion is: to what end?''   U.S. and other Western officials said Iran's major armssuppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war, China and NorthKorea, still are its main sources.   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf region reported recentlythat the Chinese are helping Iran build a plant to producesurface-to-surface missiles.   Al-Ittihad, a daily in Abu Dhabi, quoted military sources lastmonth as saying China would provide 40 new Silkworm anti-shipmissiles, a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of HQ-2Jsurface-to-air missiles, the Chinese version of the Soviet SAM-2.   Evidence increases, however, that Iran also is turning toEastern Europe for Soviet-designed weapons. U.S. sources said mostof the equipment is tanks, trucks, artillery and small arms ratherthan high-technology weapons.   Gulf newspapers have said Romania would supply nearly 500 tanks,armored vehicles and tank transporters; help build a naval base onQeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz, and convert a tractor factoryArak to produce armored vehicles.   Czechoslovakia will supply Iran with 180 T-54 and T-55 tanks andhelp build a plant to make anti-tank weapons, the papers havereported.   No independent confirmation of the reports was available, butIran has made trade agreements with several Soviet bloc states,including Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, providing forpayment in crude oil.   It has a similar pact with Brazil, now the world's sixth largestarms exporter.   Iran's official media, monitored in Nicosia, said only that thedeals involve ``products and services,'' but analysts believe armsare involved.   ``The East bloc will be swimming with T-54s and T-55s because ofEast-West force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that Iranwould be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter,'' saidHans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist with the InternationalInstitute for Strategic Studies in London.   In the U.S. source's view, arms deals with the Soviet bloc``have obvious advantages, including all-land transportationthrough Russia,'' Iran's northern neighbor.   Tehran also has strengthened military links with its easternneighbor Pakistan, a Moslem nation. The Pakistanis are developingtheir own arms industry and are advanced in the production ofmissiles and some other high-tech weapons.   Both Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, the air force commander, andAli Shamkhani, the Revolutionary Guards Corps minister, visitedIslamabad in recent weeks to meet with senior Pakistani militaryofficials.   ``We'll soon see the fruits of these talks, which have defenseand other objectives,'' Shamkhani said without elaboration.   Official Iranian media have reported a defense allocationequivalent to $5.85 billion in this year's budget, described asabout half last year's total.   Reselat, a Tehran daily, said Parliament also approved a secretbudget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher.   Exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of thesecret budget. They said it included $4.9 billion for the DefenseMinistry and $3.6 billion for Revolutionary Guards.   The Mujahedeen Khalq, based in Iraq, also told The AssociatedPress those figures did not represent Iran's ``entire plannedmilitary spending,''   Analysts have estimated that, on the basis of such needs ascombat jets, tanks, radars and missiles, Iran would spend about $5billion a year on new weapons.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, May 3</NOTE></DOC>
