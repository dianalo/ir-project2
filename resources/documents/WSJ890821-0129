The computer-services company attributed the earnings growth to strength in its employer-services and dealer-services businesses, and said it expects both those lines to have double-digit growth in the year ending June 30.    In the quarter, net income rose to a record $53 million, or 73 cents a share, from $48.6 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. In the year, net rose 10% to $187.6 million, or $2.53 a share, from $170.3 million, or $2.20 a share, in fiscal 1988. Per-share profit rose 15%, as average shares outstanding decreased about five million, to 72.8 million at June 30. ADP has been buying shares in the open market in the past few years, and is authorized to continue doing so.    Revenue rose 6.3% in the quarter, to $418.1 million from $393.2 million. The company said it anticipates &quot;a modest increase&quot; in revenue for the new year, despite an 8% expected loss in revenue resulting from the recent sale of some businesses. Fiscal 1989 revenue 8.2% to $1.68 billion from $1.55 billion.    ADP said it expects its employer-services business, which contributes 50% to sales, to have another good year, along with the automated-business-centers business, which it recently acquired. It expects a gain from the sale of its banking service, which it says will be completed soon.    The results were &quot;very much in line with our expectations,&quot; said Arthur Weinbach, chief financial officer. In the past two years, ADP consolidated many of its brokerage-service businesses into a new facility in Jersey City, and in 1989 started subletting space resulting from the consolidation.    ADP increased its provision for expected losses from excess space. The provision, combined with other nonrecurring charges, effectively canceled out a $66 million pretax gain from the sale of its automated-teller and real-estate-service businesses in the fourth quarter. Steve McClellan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Research, said the company put the entire pretax gain into reserves against losses on space in the Wall Street area. </TEXT></DOC>
