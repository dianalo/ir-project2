Most significantly, the justices agreed to decide whetherfederal bankruptcy judges may conduct jury trials -- whenthey are legally required -- on issues arising in bankruptcycases, or whether such cases may be handled only by federaldistrict judges.</LP><TEXT>   In such cases, the right to a jury trial may arise fromthe type of dispute, not directly from the bankruptcy filing.Many state and federal laws, as well as the Seventh Amendmentto the Constitution, guarantee defendants a jury trial incertain types of civil cases.   Civil jury trials in federal court are generally conductedby federal district judges, who are appointed by thepresident and confirmed by the Senate and who have lifetenure. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the federalappeals courts to 14-year terms. Neither Congress, inrevising federal bankruptcy law, nor the Supreme Court, ininterpreting the law, nor the Constitution has settled thequestion of whether bankruptcy judges may conduct jury trialswhen the disputes arise from bankruptcy cases.   The question of the authority of bankruptcy courts toconduct jury trials has divided the federal appeals courtsand created uncertainty in bankruptcy cases.   It is an issue that has important practical implications.Bankruptcy lawyers who favor jury trials in bankruptcy courtssay they are desirable because such disputes often involvethe transfer of a company's assets that needs quickresolution. Forcing these disputes to federal district courtscould involve long delays, they say. Some lawyers argueagainst bankruptcy court jury trials, fearing that bankruptcyjudges will become overloaded with such cases and becausedistrict judges have more experience with juries.   The justices agreed to resolve another bankruptcy issue inthe same case. They will decide whether a dispute aboutinsurance coverage for the assets of a company in Chapter 11reorganization is a &quot;core&quot; issue over which the bankruptcycourt has jurisdiction, or whether it is a &quot;non-core&quot; issueand should be decided by a federal district court or a statecourt.   The case is a dispute between Ben Cooper Inc., a toy andcostume manufacturer that filed for protection under Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code in April 1988, and InsuranceCompany of the State of Pennsylvania, a unit of AmericanInternational Group Inc., which insured Cooper after theChapter 11 filing. The dispute is over an insurance claim byCooper for damage caused by a fire at one of its factories inGeorgia.   A federal appeals court in New York ruled in February thatthe insurance dispute directly affected the company'sreorganization status because the insurance coverage wasbegun after the Chapter 11 filing. The appeals court said,therefore, that the dispute was within the bankruptcy court's&quot;core&quot; jurisdiction. And because such insurance fights arenormally subject to jury trials in federal court, the appealscourt said, the bankruptcy court should conduct the jurytrial.   The high court agreed to hear the insurance company'sappeal in the next court term, which begins Oct. 1. Theannouncement that the court would hear the case was containedon a list released yesterday; the justices technically begantheir summer recess Wednesday.

West Virginia Taxes                                                                                                          The justices, in two unsigned orders, ruled that courts inWest Virginia improperly refused to apply retroactively aruling that the state's corporate taxes are unconstitutional.The ruling will force the state to drop efforts to collectback assessments against some companies and may requirerefunds to others.   Without hearing oral arguments, the justices ruled infavor of Ashland Oil Inc. and National Mines Corp., aNational Steel Corp. unit. In one case, West Virginiaassessed a back levy of its business and occupation taxagainst National Mines totaling $475,345 for wholesale salesof coal mined in other states. In the other case, the stateassessed a deficiency of $181,313 against Ashland for taxeson wholesale oil sales in West Virginia.   In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia'scorporate taxes were unconstitutional because they favoredcompanies based in the state. But the West Virginia SupremeCourt of Appeals has said that the high court's decisionisn't retroactive and doesn't apply to taxes owed prior to1984.   The Supreme Court said that on the basis of two rulings itissued in other tax cases, West Virginia must consider thetaxes unconstitutional retroactively.
