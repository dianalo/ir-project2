The two republics have control over significant areas of publiclife, including education, culture and health care.   The federal parliament controls foreign affairs, defense, financeand the environment. It also has to elect a new president, virtuallycertain to be the incumbent, Vaclav Havel, after he appoints a newfederal government based on the results of the election.   The chief task of the new federal parliament, which like theregional parliaments will sit only for two years, is to draft a newCzechoslovak constitution.   This should remove the vestiges of four decades of Communist ruleand will have to deal with rising separatist sentiment in the Slovakrepublic, where many people seek the eventual creation of a separateSlovak state that could enter a new united Europe.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES: There are 22 parties competing in theelections, although some are standing only in the Czech or Slovakrepublics.
