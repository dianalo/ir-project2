A spokesman said the textile company hasn't determined the amount of the deficits.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company earned $10.7 million, or $1.12 a share, on sales of $336 million. It had 1986 net income of $17.4 million, or $2.11 a share, on sales of $1.08 billion.    In projecting the losses, Fieldcrest Cannon cited higher raw material costs -- particularly the high cost of cotton -- as well as difficulties in combining two carpet operations, and start-up costs associated with the introduction of new stain-resistant carpeting. The company said it expects margins to continue to be under pressure in the first half of 1988, followed by improvement in the second half. </TEXT></DOC>
