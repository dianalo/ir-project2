Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, yesterday said he favored imposing a fee on oil imports to raise revenue as part of a deficit-reduction package. Also this week, Sen. Bentsen introduced legislation that would require the president to take action to prevent imports from rising above 50% of U.S. oil consumption. The Senate Finance chairman said he might attach that proposal to trade legislation, which along with revenue measures falls within his committee's jurisdiction.    House Speaker Jim Wright, also a Texas Democrat, called Sen. Bentsen's proposal &quot;a very positive move.&quot; Mr. Wright, who as speaker will play an important role in shaping legislation, voiced support for the idea of linking oil legislation to the pending trade bill. &quot;Trade and energy . . . are two of the most important problems facing our country,&quot; he said. &quot;We are becoming more reliant on foreign sources for our energy. We have seen the erosion of our industrial base, including refineries.&quot;    The Reagan administration opposes an import fee, and Sen. Bentsen conceded that it would be difficult to get one through Congress without White House support. But while there is no consensus within Congress or the administration about what, if anything, should be done to buttress the domestic oil industry, some administration officials appear to be leaning toward backing tax incentives designed to encourage oil exploration and domestic production.    Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, said he expects an Energy Department study due to be released next week to show that the costs of import fees would exceed their benefits for the economy as a whole. Sen. Gramm, who has been closely involved in discussions within the Reagan administration about oil policy, predicted that the study will show that tax breaks are the least costly and most efficient way to stimulate U.S. oil exploration and development.    Under Sen. Bentsen's proposal, the president would be required to submit to Congress each year a three-year projection on U.S. oil production, demand and imports. For any year in which oil imports are projected to exceed 50% of demand, the president would be required to propose a corrective plan to Congress that could include invoking conservation measures, incentives to drill more or an oil import fee.    In a proposal aimed at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Sen. Bentsen also suggested that an oil import fee could be imposed only on foreign countries that belong to oil cartels. &quot;That way foreign dependence would be more and more on countries like Mexico, Canada and Venezuela, which traditionally have been friends of ours,&quot; he said.    Interest in oil legislation picked up last week, when Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said the U.S. should consider raising the oil-depletion allowance to curb dependence on imports. Currently, imports fill almost 40% of U.S. oil needs, up from less than 30% a year ago.    Sen. Gramm said he, working with Mr. Hodel, has drafted a bill to provide tax incentives to encourage new oil development. The tax breaks would phase out when oil prices rise above $20 a barrel.    The main element in Sen. Gramm's package is a boost in the oil depletion allowance, a deduction based on the value of the oil produced, for new wells or those that use enhanced recovery methods. When prices are below $20 a barrel, Sen. Gramm's bill would restore to the entire industry the 27.5% oil depletion allowance that it enjoyed before 1975. The additional tax break would phase out for major companies when oil prices rise to between $20 and $30 a barrel. For independents, the allowance would be phased down to 15% over that price range.    Messrs. Gramm and Hodel concede that such a package may be tough to get through Congress, but they suggest that the forthcoming Energy Department report will help generate support for it. The report's analysis of the impact of interruptions in oil supplies in the 1990's &quot;are going to show some big costs for the economy,&quot; Sen. Gramm said. </TEXT></DOC>
