Gorbachev.   Early Tuesday morning, Reagan will board Air Force One and flyto Brussels, Belgium, for two days of talks beginning Wednesdaywith the heads of state or government of the Western alliance. Themeetings at NATO headquarters will be the organization's firstfull-scale summit in six years.   With the exception of an opening statement the first day andclosing remarks on Thursday, all of the sessions will be in private.   Thorny problems on basing rights for U.S. military forces aswell as West German reluctance about modernizing short-rangenuclear weapons are expected to remain on the shelf as NATO leaderstry to highlight areas of agreement.   ``There is a good chance for a love-in. It looks as though theyhave it pretty well wired,'' said Robert E. Hunter, director ofEuropean studies for the Washington-based Center for Strategic andInternational Studies.   ``Anything that comes out ought to show that the alliance isstrong and that everybody is working together and moving togetherbasically in the same direction,'' said a senior White Houseofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``Nobody's going in there looking for confrontation,'' theofficial added.   The meeting offers a chance to review how to deal with thechallenge to NATO by Gorbachev's public relations offensive to givehim the image of a champion of peace and disarmament.   It also could highlight that although a lame-duck Reagan islosing his clout on domestic policy at home, he still commandsrespect as a world leader.   ``I think a lot of time is going to be spent among the leaderstalking about East-West relations, talking about change in theSoviet Union, talking about what's real and what's just words andhow that guides us in dealing with our public,'' said one official,speaking at a White House briefing on condition of being identifiedonly as a senior administration official.   The official said the problem of the Warsaw Pact's overwhelmingsuperiority in conventional military forces will have ``a verycentral place'' in the talks and be the subject of ``a lot oftime.''   However, it was understood there was difficulty in producing ahoped-for statement on conventional weapons because of disagreementabout what should go into it.   Sensitive questions on the pace of modernizing battlefieldnuclear weapons in Europe will be looked at only broadly, theofficial said, with nuts-and-bolts discussions left for meetings ofdefense ministers and foreign ministers.   Likewise, the official said ``it would be a perilous way to go''to have the leaders tackle differences over U.S. bases in Spain,Greece and Portugal. Instead, those problems will be left tonegotiators who have been working on the issue.   Given budget pressures in the United States, one question willbe how NATO nations can absorb a greater share of the defenseburden, or as the administration official said, ``how do you staystronger with less money.''   To counter Gorbachev's peace offensive, Reagan can be expectedto trumpet the signing in Washington of a U.S.-Soviet treaty toeliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles (INF).   The summit falls within three months of an expectedReagan-Gorbachev meeting in Moscow in late May or early June. Infact, a team of White House planners will break off from thepresidential party at the conclusion of the Brussels meeting nextThursday and fly to Moscow to begin planning the superpower summit.   If, as expected, Reagan gets strong backing in Brussels, he cango to Moscow saying he has the alliance behind him.   ``If you don't have an alliance that's split, you're dealingfrom a position of strength,'' the White House official said.   Hunter said the allies ``believe that Gorbachev got the betterpart of the deal on the INF treaty, and they want to be reassuredthat in Moscow the president will have deep concern for Europeaninterests. And he (Reagan) will say all the right things next week(to reassure them).''   Reagan already has taken some of the steam out of the drive fora treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons by 50percent. He said in an interview there is too little time tocomplete an agreement before he goes to Moscow.   White House planners said the NATO summit also could produce oneor two more Senate votes for the INF treaty. However, the agreementalready seems assured of ratification by an overwhelming margin.</TEXT></DOC>
