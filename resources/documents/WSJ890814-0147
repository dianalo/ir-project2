The English did not seem at all embarrassed by these distinctions.    As an American, I was outraged by the inequities of the system, and saw it as an insidious method of maintaining class distinctions. I remembered with pride my own school days, and the fact that in my American high school, we all read Dickens and Shakespeare, we all studied European and American history. In the U.S., there were expectations for all of us.    By the time I returned to the United States in the late 1960s, the source of my pride in American education had begun to crumble. What I found when I arrived was a British school system in the making. Course requirements and curriculums were being abandoned. We had to increase our global perspective. We had to find more &quot;relevant&quot; material for the disaffected student. We had to give various ethnic groups their own literature and history, as if Western culture were not their birthright as well. We had to find something &quot;those kids&quot; could read. . . .    For a moment, the cry became &quot;Back to basics]&quot; But no one was quite sure what they were, and hadn't they caused all the trouble in the first place? . . .    I would like all policymakers, politicians and teachers, before they support any approach or curriculum, to consider if it is one they would choose for their own children. A voice in my head says, &quot;Don't be silly. 'Our' children are different, more capable and more motivated.&quot; Are they? One only has to observe all the tutoring and summer preparatory programs in our private schools to realize that not all middle- or upper-class children are born scholars. When they are &quot;our children,&quot; we assume that they must be pushed and pulled until they get where they want to go. To make other assumptions for other people's children, to do less for &quot;those kids&quot; as opposed to our kids seems, at the very least, immoral. At the very worst, it can destroy the fabric of that society of which many of us, and for good reason, were so very proud. </TEXT></DOC>
