The stoppages are part of a wave of union militancy confrontingPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government as ittries to halt inflation topping 8 percent.   The rail and subway strike is the fifth joint 24-hour stoppage infive weeks. Hopes were raised Monday that the rail strike could beaverted when a second British Rail union accepted an 8.8 percentwage increase.   The 17,500-member train crews' union, the Associated Society ofLocomotive Engineers and Firemen, accepted the offer and called offits ban on working overtime and days off.   However, the third and biggest union, the National Union ofRailwaymen, rejected it late Monday night, holding out for a10-percent raise for its 75,000 members.   The union's general secretary, Jimmy Knapp, told reporters theoffer was simply not enough.   Rail workers are among Britain's lowest paid industrialemployees, with average earnings, including overtime, of $471 a weekfor drivers and $325 for the rest.   Transport Minister Paul Channon called the decision``irresponsible.''   ``I think people will be utterly astonished and totally fed up,''he said.   Mrs. Thatcher came to office 10 years ago declaring that thebattle against inflation was her prime economic aim. But the annualinflation rate, at 8.3 percent against 4.9 percent a year ago, isthe highest in the 12-nation European Economic Community.   The 10,500 striking London subway workers are also among thelowest paid industrial staff. They want a $102 weekly pay raise tooperate subway trains without conductors.   Management has offered $48 plus extra vacation, but is demandingincreased production.   The National Association of Port Employers said an indefinitestrike that began among 9,400 dockworkers at 60 ports around Britainon July 10 is crumbling. The association's spokesman Iain Dale saidthat just 37 of the 60 ports are now halted and that the other 23are working normally.   The dockworkers are striking over he government's abolition atthe 60 ports of a legally enforced scheme dating back to 1947 thatguaranteed them work. Britain's other 102 ports are unaffected bythe strike.   Also on strike were more than 500,000 members of the National andLocal Government Officers Association, halting municipal servicesacross the country.   The workers earn an average of about $16,000 a year. They want a12 percent pay raise. Their employers have offered 7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
