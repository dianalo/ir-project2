Meeting as regulatory agencies made two announcementsunderscoring the urgency of swift action, the House Bankingsubcommittee on financial institutions on Thursday also decided topermit regulators to charge higher deposit insurance premiums toinstitutions engaged in speculative lending.   By a 27-20 vote, the subcommittee authorized the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., if it chooses, to levy higher premiums againstSandamp;Ls and banks making high-risk investments.   The Bush administration opposes the measure. It is trying toprevent delay of its Sandamp;L rescue package by deferring ticklishdeposit insurance issues until the completion of an 18-month study.   The FDIC said it took over 38 institutions, bringing the totalnumber of Sandamp;Ls under its supervision to 215 in 31 states. Theagency is attempting to hold losses down at the sickest Sandamp;Ls untilCongress appropriates the money to close or merge them.   Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the industrysuffered $9.4 billion in withdrawals in February, the 10thconsecutive month of outflows and down only slightly from the $10.6billion record in January.   The House subcommittee, in the first of three scheduled all-daysessions, slogged through 48 of 165 proposed amendments, adoptingtwo that would increase the power of the FDIC over Sandamp;Ls and denythe Bush administration some of the political control it had soughtover the agency.   But it was a push by Northern legislators to force Texas,California, Florida and other states with lax regulation ofstate-chartered Sandamp;Ls to pay part of the bailout cost that generatedthe most heated debate.   The panel voted 39-7 against an amendment sponsored by Reps.Paul E. Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, requiringstates with high numbers of state-chartered thrift failures tocontribute 20 percent of the cost of bailing them out.   The measure drew considerable sympathy, but committee membersargued against it for political reasons.   ``This would have sent the bill to Fort Sumter. It would havestarted the second Civil War,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., saidafter the vote.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, argued that attaching punitive measuresto the Sandamp;L bill could draw a veto from President Bush: ``All I askthe people here is, with this provision, is there a slight chancethat a Texan in the White House will sign it?''   Kanjorski and Kaptur argued that Texas will get the lion's shareof the bailout, $31 billion, representing $1,856 for every man,woman and child in the state, while most other states will pay morethan they get, $479 per capita in Connecticut, for instance.   ``What we are involved in here ... is the most mammoth transferof resources from many regions of the country to one region of thecountry in the history of the republic. Everything else done by thegovernment pales in comparison,'' said Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y.   However, Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said the measure wasunconstitutional, arguing, ``This is an excellent amendment forthose who wish to vent anger, but it is bad law.''   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full bankingpanel, called the amendment an ``outlandish'' and ``shoddilywritten concoction.''   The FDIC was one of the big winners in Thursday's session. Itwon support on a 35-12 vote for an amendment giving it, rather thanthe Federal Home Loan Bank System, primary authority overstate-chartered Sandamp;Ls.   The measure was sponsored by Leach, who intended it as a rebuketo the bank system. Sandamp;Ls' chief lobby group, the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions, said in a letter Thursday that they oppose asimilar measure before the Senate Banking Committee.   In a move to secure the political independence of the FDIC, theHouse panel provided fixed four-year terms to its chairman and vicechairman. The Bush administration had proposed that the chairmanserve at the pleasure of the president. It also increased theFDIC's borrowing limit.   Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee concluded three days ofbehind-closed-door meetings intended to smooth the way for a fullSenate vote the week of April 17. The House subcommittee plans tofinish its version of the bill next week.</TEXT></DOC>
