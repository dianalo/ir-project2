The Bush administration will begin shipping military equipment to Colombia, under a $65 million emergency aid program announced by White House officials at the president's vacation home here. The U.S. will send helicopters, small arms, radios, jeeps, assault boats, grenade launchers and military technicians to help Colombia fight drug cartels that have begun widespread anti-government violence in the South American country.    Meanwhile, President Bush also will summon several members of his cabinet here later in the week to set strategy for pushing the administration's broad drug-fighting plan, which Mr. Bush is to unveil Sept. 5. The president has approved a plan that will call for the U.S. to spend about $7.5 billion a year to fight drug use and cut off drug trafficking.    The president has &quot;signed off on the fundamentals&quot; of his anti-drug strategy but wants to meet with top advisers to discuss operating details and strategy for selling his proposals in Congress and to the public, the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, said in an interview. The administration's drug czar, William Bennett, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh are expected to attend.    The emergency dispatch of aid to Colombia is the most significant step the administration has taken so far to try to staunch the flow of drugs at a foreign source. The administration acted with unusual haste, after Colombian drug dealers assassinated a leading presidential candidate, bombed political offices and declared &quot;absolute war&quot; on the government.    The $65 million assistance package for Colombia is paid for with funds from an emergency pool of foreign aid money that the president can use at his discretion in international emergencies. White House officials said that the expenditure is the largest single one ever made from the special fund, and that it exhausts the money available in the fund for the current fiscal year.    The money will be used to buy, among other things, 20 Huey helicopters, one Blackhawk helicopter, an undetermined number of fixed-wing aircraft and 18-man assault boats. The equipment will help the Colombian government quickly move troops or police to sites where drugs are being shipped or processed, which U.S. officials say is one of Colombia's most pressing needs.    And, in an indication of the growing firepower of international drug cartels, the U.S. also is including some anti-tank weapons in its emergency package.    In addition, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that a &quot;small&quot; number of U.S. military advisers and military trainers will be dispatched to Colombia to help soldiers and police forces in that country use the new equipment. Mr. Fitzwater insisted that the U.S. soldiers will be in Colombia to &quot;train in the use of the equipment and not there for combat advisory purposes or anything like that.&quot;    The question of U.S. troops has become a sensitive one for both the Bush administration and Colombia. After Attorney General Thornburgh said recently that the U.S. would consider dispatching troops to help Colombia fight drugs if asked, there was a flurry of speculation that U.S. forces might be requested. But Colombian officials were embarrassed by the implication that they might have to rely on U.S. soldiers to fight their battle with drug cartels, and President Bush himself quickly tried to quash speculation that he would send troops.    The Colombian emergency package only sets the stage for Mr. Bush to announce another dose of drug-fighting aid for Colombia and other South American countries, when he announces his broad drug-fighting plan next week. Though the drug plan will focus most heavily on cracking down on drug use in the U.S., it also will include millions of dollars in funds to help foreign lands try to eradicate drug crops or cut off drug shipments to the U.S.    In Washington, Justice Department officials said a meeting between Mr. Thornburgh and top Colombian law-enforcement officials, planned for last week, had been postponed. U.S. officials said that, among other problems, there are concerns about ensuring the security of the Colombian officials. Separately, Colombian President Virgilio Barco said in an address to his country that he plans to speak before the United Nations at the end of September &quot;to carry our message to the world community.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
