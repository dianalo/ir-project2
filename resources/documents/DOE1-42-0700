<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0700 </DOCNO><TEXT>Over the past year, the experimental scientists and engineers have workedwith the instrument developers, field crews, and data analysts as a teamthat has participated in 56 downhole experiments and borehole surveysat Fenton Hill, NM; Imperial Valley, CA; Geysers, CA; Valles Caldera,NM and Costa Rica. These well-logging surveys and experiments were performedin geothermal boreholes where temperatures ranged from 240 to 355{sup0}C. The wide variety of problems encountered and the results of theteam analyses has lead to development of geothermal wellbore instrumentationthat will work reliably at 300{sup 0}C. This work has also provoked continuousupgrading and improvements in the prototype instruments as well as severalnew initiatives which will be described in this paper. The paper describesthe operation and calibration of a spinner/temperature/pressure tool.</TEXT></DOC>
