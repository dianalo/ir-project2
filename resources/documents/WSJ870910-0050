The purchase of the properties from Summa, the closely held Las Vegas investment concern founded by the late Howard Hughes, would be through MGM Grand, currently part of Mr. Kerkorian's personal holding company, Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Tracinda Corp. MGM Grand, however, has a registration statement pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a rights offering that would make the concern publicly traded.    Terry Christensen, president of Tracinda, said the purchase is contingent on approval by Nevada gambling authorities. The Desert Inn Country Club and Spa and the Sands Hotel and Casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip, together have 1,600 rooms and cover nearly 200 acres.    Mr. Kerkorian left the casino business in April 1986, when Bally Manufacturing Corp. completed the purchase of his 70%-owned MGM Grand Hotels Inc. for $440 million.    Fred Benninger, chairman and president of Tracinda's recently formed MGM Grand Inc. unit, said the Nevada Gaming Commission is expected to approve the purchase by the end of the year. Mr. Benninger said MGM Grand hasn't yet decided how the properties will be modified or how much capital will be required to improve them.    Summa officials weren't immediately available for comment. The two casinos had been up for sale for more than a year, industry experts said.    The 70-year-old Mr. Kerkorian, who launched his career by shuttling gamblers to Las Vegas in an old World War II bomber, has been rumored for months to be interested in buying Las Vegas gambling properties. In August, Mr. Kerkorian narrowly missed buying the Dunes Hotel andamp; Country Club, when his offer was topped by a $157.7 million bid from Japanese investor Masao Nangaku.    Over the past two decades, Mr. Kerkorian has been involved in building of the MGM Grand Hotel (now Bally's Las Vegas), and the International Hotel andamp; Casino (now the Las Vegas Hilton), which he sold along with the Flamingo Hotel to Hilton Hotels Corp.    Mr. Kerkorian currently has the right to use the name MGM Grand, Mr. Christensen said, but said the company will continue to operate the Desert Inn and the Sands under their current names for now. In the original transaction with Bally, Mr. Kerkorian agreed not to use the MGM Grand name until April 1989, but that agreement was altered a few months ago, Mr. Christensen said.    Representatives of Mr. Kerkorian wouldn't speculate on how the two casinos would be run, but the Kerkorian style in previous Nevada ventures has been to cater to high rollers and to offer flashy entertainment on a large scale. By contrast, the Sands and Desert Inn recently have been aimed toward small bettors.    The agreement to buy the two properties is the latest in a series of new ventures for the publicity-shy investor, who also owns a 79% stake in MGM/UA Communications Co., an entertainment concern. Mr. Kerkorian recently started a transportation venture, MGM Grand Air, a premium-service airline that began scheduled service between Los Angeles and New York yesterday.    The SEC filing covering the proposed rights offering by its parent, MGM Grand Inc., said Mr. Kerkorian is expected to hold 70% of 5.2 million units registered. The offering is limited to former holders of MGM Grand Hotels Inc., in which Mr. Kerkorian also held a 70% interest. The filing said that proceeds are expected to finance the luxury carrier and acquisitions in businesses including gambling and airlines.    As previously reported, Mr. Kerkorian also has a contract with the management of Pan Am Corp. to examine the troubled carrier's books and records for a possible investment. Mr. Christensen said the review is expected to continue for several more weeks, and could be extended to late October. The agreement allows the airline to explore the possibility of an investment by two other parties, Mr. Christensen said, although he declined to identify them. Pan Am representatives haven't commented on the talks.    Tracinda officials have also met informally with representatives of Pan Am's unions, but no detailed discussions have been held, according to Mr. Christensen. </TEXT></DOC>
