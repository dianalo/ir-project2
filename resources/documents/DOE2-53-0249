Because of the neutron energy dependenceof the /sup 6/Li cross section, mixed spectrum reactors can lead to severeself-shielding in a solid breeder test. This self-shielding can be minimizedby selecting lower /sup 6/Li enrichments, by selecting small specimendimensions, or by spectral tailoring. The effect of spectral tailoringwas considered for a large solid breeder test in a mixed spectrum reactor.Fast neutron reactors offer the opportunity to conduct large multipleinteraction tests at high lithium burnup.</TEXT></DOC>
