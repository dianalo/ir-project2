Two ways of improving polarization transfer will be treated:passing through depolarizing resonances using either fast tune shiftsor slow adiabatic spin flip, and reducing the strength of depolarizingresonances by redesigning the lattice using spin matching. It is shownthat a combination of the two methods can result in about 70% polarizationtransfer through the accelerators, providing about 55% polarization of30 GeV protons.</TEXT></DOC>
