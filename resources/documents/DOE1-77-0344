Driving this need to share is a stunning technological capacityfor automated processing, a deep-rooted desire to share born from a perceptionseemingly limitless possibilities, and a fiscal requirement to do betterwith less by making more out of what we have. Unfortunately, the sharedinformation processing benefits Government Oversight Agencies (GOA's)need are not available just for the asking or for the cost of the equipment.This frustrates the manager who thinks the box on the desk should helpwith decision support as well as it helps with task automation. To moveGOA's toward successful shared information processing and decision mechanisms,Management Systems Laboratories (MSL), under the grant, plans to accomplishthe following two-part objectives: To use the real-world laboratory ofthe US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Materials (ONM) asa generic test to observe, define, characterize, and qualitatively modelthe shared information processing in a GOA; and then To develop qualitativeand quantitative instruments to measure, evaluate and promote the psychological,sociological, and technological dimensions of successful sharing.</TEXT></DOC>
