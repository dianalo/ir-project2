Twenty-eightsurface sediment samples from the Elizabeth River and 40 surface sedimentsamples from the Patapsco, were analyzed in detail for the presence ofmainly aromatic and polar organic compounds. Approximately 310 distinctcompounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry inthe Elizabeth River samples, and about 480 in the Patapsco. Total aromaticconcentrations ranged from 440,000 to 3,100 ppb in the Elizabeth andfrom 2.7 x 10{sup 6} to 6100 ppb in the Patapsco. Similar to observationin the Chesapeake Bay, unsubstituted polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbonsdominated, contributing about 50% to the total resolved concentration.This report consists of four appendices that present lists of concentrationsand computer-reconstructed gas chromatograms of aromatic extracts fromElizabeth River sediments.</TEXT></DOC>
