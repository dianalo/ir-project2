With some misgivings, Democrats in the Senate and theHouse agreed yesterday that they have little choice but toaccept Mr. Bush's invitation to a so-called budget summit.Congressional leaders are to meet with Mr. Bush this morningto tell him that. Senate Budget Committee Chairman JamesSasser (D., Tenn.) said talks could begin before the weekends.</LP><TEXT>   While the White House stuck tenaciously to its pledge toavoid preconditions, Republican Whip Sen. Alan Simpson ofWyoming declared flatly: &quot;Nobody's talking about raisingincome tax rates.&quot;   And other Republicans went even farther. &quot;I'm opposed tohaving taxes be on the table, period,&quot; said Rep. BillSchuette (R., Mich.), who is challenging incumbent DemocraticSen. Sander Levin.   Democrats, on the other hand, insist they won't agree toany package that relies exclusively on raising revenue bycutting capital-gains tax rates and imposing regressiveenergy and excise taxes. They will press for an increase inthe marginal income tax rate on the richest Americans, now28%. Many Democrats consider that unfair because someless-wealthy taxpayers face a 33% marginal rate -- the rateon the last dollar of income.   And as Democratic leaders try to assemble a coalition, thecall by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) for cutting SocialSecurity payroll taxes may find new support, even among thosewho were cool to the idea before.   &quot;It can't just be gasoline taxes,&quot; said House BudgetChairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). &quot;It demands thatDemocrats be for equity, and that means `the bubble' {CapitolHill jargon for raising the marginal tax rate on the richesttaxpayers above the current 28%} or Moynihan.&quot;   At separate House and Senate caucuses, Democratsrepeatedly expressed fears that Mr. Bush will use a budgetsummit to make them take the blame for raising taxes. &quot;Theyhave just one goal: To put the tax noose around our neck,&quot;said Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.).   Sen. Sasser voiced the same fear. &quot;If revenues are used tosolve this problem,&quot; he said, &quot;the president will say, `theDemocrats made me do it.'&quot; When talks begin, Sen. Sasservowed, &quot;The first question I'm going to ask {Mr. Bush} is,`What is your proposal?'&quot;   At the House caucus, some Democrats demanded thatPresident Bush clearly state the dimensions of the presentdeficit so the public will understand why taxes may beneeded. White House Budget Director Richard Darman may becalled to Capitol Hill to testify on his revised deficitestimates and the administration's proposed solutions.   Distrust of the White House is so strong among Democratsin Congress that one Southern Democrat even suggested thatthe different sides communicate in writing so that allunderstand what they are getting into. Rank-and-fileDemocrats warned their leaders that they aren't blindlypromising to accept whatever the summit produces.   In short, Democrats don't want to be trapped. &quot;They don'twant to be blamed for the result,&quot; said Rep. Panetta. &quot;Itwill take a lot of good faith,&quot; he added. &quot;It's very tough tofind good faith in an election year.&quot;   The primary goal of budget talks will be to assemble apackage of revenue increases and spending cuts to avoidtriggering across-the-board spending cuts this fall under theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Budget Director Darmansays that means paring more than $50 billion from thedeficit. The Gramm-Rudman deficit target for fiscal 1991,which begins Oct. 1, is $64 billion.   Taxes, of course, won't be the only controversy.Republicans and Democrats differ sharply on how much to cutthe defense budget and how hard to squeeze domestic spending.White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater yesterday saidMr. Bush wants one comprehensive pact that sustains economicgrowth, cuts the deficit over more than one year andoverhauls of the often-criticized federal budget process.   But taxes were about the only issue on the lips of membersof Congress yesterday, both because of the uncertainty overMr. Bush's position and because some Republicans areconvinced that their party's fortunes rest on their image astax foes. Some Republicans are particularly upset that theirleaders, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Robert Michel ofIllinois, seemed resigned to tax increases after joiningtheir Democratic counterparts at a meeting with Mr. BushSunday night.   &quot;If the Republicans are dumb enough to give up the taxissues,&quot; said Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), &quot;you bet it's goingto hurt us at the polls.&quot; He called the public's perceptionof the differences between the two parties' stances on taxes&quot;the most significant distinction . . . in this post-Cold Warera.&quot;   Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.), who is using the tax issue inher campaign to replace Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), saidyesterday that she isn't concerned that Mr. Bush will somehowundercut her chances by agreeing to tax increases in asummit. But she drew a much harder line on taxes than theadministration has, ruling out increases in personal taxes,corporate taxes and &quot;consumer taxes.&quot;   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia added thatno summit agreement will erase the distinction between thetwo parties. &quot;They aren't going to undo {Walter} Mondale,{Michael} Dukakis and {Jesse} Jackson in one signingceremony,&quot; he said.   Republican pollster Vincent Baglio, though counselingRepublican candidates not to waver from their no-new-taxesstance now, says that President Bush's popularity couldprevent any tax increases from hurting the party. &quot;Clearly,George Bush has tremendous popularity, and any politicianwith tremendous popularity can lead public opinion as well astake some direction from it.&quot;   Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, predictsthat Democrats will flub a chance to turn Mr. Bush'ssurrender on taxes into a potent political issue. He saysthey can hurt Mr. Bush if they effectively contrast hissupport for, say, gasoline-tax increases with his insistenceon cutting capital-gains taxes. &quot;The danger to Bush comes ifthe Democrats get smart and start defining just who Bush iswilling to tax and who he isn't,&quot; he says.   &quot;If the Democrats do that they make the issue take on apolitical cost to Bush -- but these people seem to have losttheir political compass,&quot; Mr. Phillips adds.   ---   David Rogers and Jeffrey H.
