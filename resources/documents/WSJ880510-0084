The debate had been scheduled to begin tomorrow, but leaders of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees sought the delay. &quot;There are serious problems and until they are resolved, I think it would be very difficult to proceed with a full-fledged debate in the Senate,&quot; said Sen. William Cohen, (R., Maine), vice chairman of the intelligence committee. &quot;My feeling is that until these disputes are resolved, we should not proceed.&quot;    Administration officials said the Soviets haven't agreed to some U.S. demands for on-site inspection of facilities where medium-range missiles are assembled or stored. They said the delay in the Senate debate probably means the Senate won't approve the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty before President Reagan begins his Moscow summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev May 29.    &quot;I have absolutely no intention of being governed by an artificial deadline,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). &quot;May 29 is just a date on the calendar. It means nothing to me or to this Senate.&quot;    A State Department official said ratifying the INF Treaty &quot;isn't an essential component of the summit,&quot; and said the pact itself isn't in jeopardy. And Senate leaders said they hope the problems over verification can be resolved during a trip by Secretary of State George Shultz and National Security Adviser Colin Powell to Geneva. They said they hope the Senate debate can begin by late this week or early next week.    In a Capitol Hill meeting, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Mr. Powell concurred with the lawmakers' decision to delay consideration of the treaty, senators said. The decision came after the Senate Intelligence Committee heard administration officials testify about outstanding questions regarding on-site verification.    U.S. officials acknowledged that in a letter delivered to Mr. Shultz Sunday by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, the Soviets backed away from what one U.S. official called &quot;a series of Mickey Mouse provisions&quot; in the INF treaty. One such provision would permit inspectors to examine missile cannisters that are smaller than missiles covered by the treaty.    U.S. diplomats attributed the apparent Soviet balk to disputes in Moscow over how much on-site inspection should be permitted, not to any Soviet desire to back away from the treaty itself. &quot;This probably reflects internal disorganization and dispute of the kind that occasionally has plagued us,&quot; a State Department official said. &quot;Officials at the gerbil level have cold feet about what the people at the policy level agreed to, but as soon as these issues reach the policy-level people, they'll be resolved. At the end of the day, we'll get done what we need to get done.&quot;    But Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was less optimistic. &quot;This is no way to begin a relationship under a treaty as important as this if these deliberate ambiguities remain,&quot; he told reporters. Sen. Cohen also said he is &quot;less optimistic&quot; that the U.S.-Soviet differences can be resolved quickly. </TEXT></DOC>
