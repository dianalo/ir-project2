Before approving the health-care bill, the Health and Energy Subcommittee adopted amendments to provide a prescription-drug benefit, to provide occasional home-care services for house-bound Medicare recipients receiving full-time care by unpaid relatives, and to reduce the financial burden of spouses of nursing-home residents.    The drug-sales bill, adopted by a voice vote, would allow doctors to sell drugs they prescribe only at cost. It would provide exceptions for injected drugs, for physicians in rural areas and for medical emergencies.    Without the legislation, doctors have a financial incentive to &quot;over-prescribe and over-medicate,&quot; said Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), sponsor of the measure. During an interview, Mr. Wyden acknowledged that only about 5% of all doctors sell drugs to their patients. But he said the figure could grow.    Mr. Wyden's effort is opposed by the Competitive Health Care Coalition, a group representing companies that purchase drugs in bulk from manufacturers, repackage them in safety-seal containers and resell the product to doctors.    Rep. Wyden called repackagers a &quot;group of fast-buck artists who are basically talking about nothing but easy money.&quot; But the coalition, contending that drugs sold by physicians are cheaper and therefore more attractive to consumers, predicted the lawmaker's bill eventually will be defeated.    &quot;It is also clear that the public is just beginning to learn that physician-dispensed prescriptions are not only less expensive than the prices at drugstore chains, but more convenient,&quot; said Bill West, a member of the coalition. &quot;We feel confident that the public will demand more competitive prices. Once the consumer and Congress is informed, this anti-competitive legislation . . . will never become law.&quot;    During testimony in April, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver said the legislation would restrain competition. He argued that selling drugs poses no conflict of interest for physicians. The commission also has urged state legislatures to oppose similar measures.    The amendments on catastrophic health care were added to legislation already passed by the House Ways and Means Committee. Before clearing the entire package on a 9-1 vote, the Health and Energy Subcommittee approved an amendment to cover prescription-drug costs, above a $400 yearly deductible, for Medicare recipients.    The panel also adopted the amendment to give limited in-home care for housebound Medicare recipients.    The panel approved another provision that would allow spouses of nursing-home residents to keep a larger portion of their income while Medicaid pays the nursing-home bill. </TEXT></DOC>
