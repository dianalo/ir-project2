The partner, John L. Montgomery, 53 years old, who headed consulting in the New York area for the past four years, was reassigned to head Peat's strategic and operations management services.    In his previous job, Mr. Montgomery had some 375 consulting professionals, including 50 partners, reporting to him. In his new job, he will serve in a staff function and work with personnel reporting to other partners. Peat, which has the fifth-largest consulting practice in the country, has 1,975 partners, of which 320 are consultants.    Some Peat partners say the move reflects a power struggle within the firm between accountants and consultants. &quot;Over the past few years, the accounting partners have been trying to exercise more power over the consulting partners, who are bringing in more money&quot; per partner, said a partner who requested anonymity. &quot;John was a strong advocate of consultants running their own practice, and he paid for it,&quot; the partner added.    Mr. Montgomery said in an interview that the job change &quot;was requested of me as a recognition of my desire to get into a new dimension of the consulting business.&quot; He declined to comment on whether his job change reflects his advocacy of consultants running their own practice.    &quot;I don't understand what you mean,&quot; he said, when asked about the problem of consultants resenting accountants' control in the major accounting firms.    In his new job, Mr. Montgomery will report to William Hasler, vice chairman in charge of Peat's consulting practice.    Mr. Montgomery's job change doesn't reflect any unrest, said Herbert E. Morse, vice chairman of Peat's New York region and managing partner of the New York office, the man to whom Mr. Montgomery reported prior to the job change.    &quot;This isn't a reaction to consultants vs. CPAs, but rather a structural change in the firm,&quot; Mr. Morse said. &quot;We want to build up our strategic services practice, and John Montgomery is the right man for the job.&quot;    In the past few months, consulting partners have been fired at Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. and Arthur Young andamp; Co. for allegedly trying to leave the firms and take consulting business with them -- charges those partners deny. Consulting partners have been complaining that accounting partners won't let them reap the rewards of increased consulting business, and that they force them to share in paying for litigation costs of malpractice suits involving allegedly faulty audits.    Peat said Mr. Montgomery was being succeeded by Michael J. May, 38, who joined the firm in 1982 and has been a partner in charge of financial services consulting in the New York region since 1985.    In what could be another indication of a growing schism between Peat consulting and accounting partners, Russell Peppet, 48, managing partner of the firm's Silicon Valley consulting practice in California, said he plans to leave Peat in the fall. Mr. Peppet headed Peat's consulting practice in the U.S. and world-wide from 1981 through 1986 before being assigned to head the San Jose office two years ago.    &quot;I'd like to get back into the mainstream of consulting and plan to investigate various possibilities nationally and internationally,&quot; Mr. Peppet said. </TEXT></DOC>
