Under the agreement, the operator of rural health-care systems said it must close or sell 22 of its 40 systems, &quot;plus certain other business interests.&quot; As a result, Westworld said it will incur a &quot;very substantial&quot; charge when it reports fourth-quarter results. For the first nine months, Westworld posted a loss of $1.8 million on revenue of $148.6 million.    Westworld, which has had trouble controlling costs during a rapid expansion, already began closing eight of the 40 health care systems in November. The company's bank credit line was increased to $60 million from $50 million in September.    Separately, Westworld said it is developing a proposed exchange offer with holders of its $65 million in long-term notes and debentures. The offer, which Westworld expects to make in the next two weeks, is expected to include new debentures with equity participation.    Last November, Westworld deferred about $2.5 million in interest payments on the debentures, pending completion of its restructuring plans. A Westworld spokesman said the company still hasn't made the interest payments. </TEXT></DOC>
