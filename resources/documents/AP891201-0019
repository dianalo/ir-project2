(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state can still regulate who can ownguns despite an amendment to Nebraska's constitution that allowsresidents to bear arms in almost all circumstances, the stateSupreme Court ruled today.   The ruling came in the case of two men whose cases weredismissed by district judges who cited the amendment, approved byvoters in the Nov. 8, 1988, general election.   Defendants Charles A. Comeau and Larry Rush of Lincoln Countycontended that the amendment's language must be read literally andthat the language prevents any regulation by the Legislature of theright to possess arms.   The state argued that the right to keep and bear arms is limitedto lawful purposes.   ``There are very few rights which are absolute,'' Judge LeslieBoslaugh wrote in the state high court's opinion. ``In every phaseof everyday experience, there are extremes beyond which somerestraint or regulation is necessary for the common good.''   Most states regulate handgun ownership in some form, Boslaughsaid. Prohibiting convicted felons, for instance, from possessingguns is widely accepted, he said.   Four states prohibit carrying a handgun without a license orpermit, and several states do not allow handguns to be concealedwithout a license, Boslaugh said.   ``We conclude that the right to keep and bear arms is notunlimited,'' Boslaugh wrote. He added the state had the power tomake ``reasonable regulations for the purpose of protecting thehealth, safety and welfare of its citizens.''   The controversial amendment to the Nebraska Constitutionincludes a part that reads, ``the right to keep and bear arms forsecurity or defense of self, family, home, and others, and forlawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all otherlawful purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringedby the state or any subdivision thereof.''</TEXT></DOC>
