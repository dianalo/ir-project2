The admakers at PaineWebber Inc. scrambled Monday afternoon tomake a new version of their long-running ``PaineWebber SpecialReports'' commercials that give the views of some of its topexecutives.   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., meanwhile, unveiled a new campaigndebuting Wednesday in which it stakes its claim to an industryleadership role.   Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was already on the air during Sunday'sbaseball World Series broadcast with commercials it has used beforewith the tagline ``A Tradition of Trust.''   But Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co. isn't likely to rerun theadvertisement it placed in Friday's Wall Street Journal anytimesoon.   ``What does an old-fashioned investment firm say to someone whofled to CD's two years ago?'' the ad said. ``The environment thatdrove you into CD's is not the environment of 1989.''   ``The timing wasn't exactly propitious,'' spokesman Bob Connorconceded Monday even as the Dow Jones industrial average recouped88.12 points of the 190.58 it lost Friday. ``I don't think we'llrun it again this week.''   Financial services advertising has been in the doldrums sincespending fell sharply after the October 1987 market crash.   Financial advertising on network television, for instance, wasdown 25 percent from a year ago in the first six months of 1989,according to the Television Bureau of Advertising.   Advertising in the print media also has been soft, as evinced byDow Jones andamp; Co.'s report last week that ad linage in The WallStreet Journal was down 7.9 percent in the first nine months of theyear.   The stock market's sharp selloff Friday afternoon left no timefor most financial services companies to come up with newadvertising for the weekend.   But moments after the market closed Monday afternoon,PaineWebber was recording Mary Farrell, a senior vice president andinvestment strategist, for a one-minute commercial on her view ofmarket developments.   The message: Farrell says that although wide swings may beinevitable in the short term, the stock market ``is still the placeto be for long-term appreciation.''   Some critics say investor confidence in the market is so low fewpeople will pay any attention to such pronouncements.   But John Lampe, advertising director for PaineWebber, said hewanted to get the commercial on the air immediately.   ``It shows the people that are watching the commercials that weare on top of what is going on in the marketplace and are trying tobe upfront and candid about our advice,'' he said.   Shearson hired a new ad agency last spring, and the new campaign``Leadership by Example'' is the first offering produced by Ally andamp;Gargano Inc.   Hardwick Simmons, Shearson's vice chairman, said the ads weredesigned to tout the firm's leadership role in areas such asover-the-counter stocks, municipal bonds and assets undermanagement without making the firm ``appear arrogant orYuppie-like.''   Five commercials have been created. In one, a European companyin need of $300 million is depicted as turning to Shearson, whichtapped its Tokyo, New York and Geneva offices to arrange low costfinancing within 24 hours.   In another ad, scenes of Russians, Chinese and East Europeansenjoying the fruits of capitalism _ like skateboards, hot dogs andfancy sneakers _ are shown to illustrate that Shearson stands readyto ``help expand the free enterprise system globally.''   The campaign and the scheduling of its debut during Wednesdaynight's boradcast of the World Series baseball game were determinedwell before Friday's market fall and Monday's partial recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
