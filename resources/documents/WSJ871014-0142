The appointments strengthen the central management of the big advertising and consulting group. The group has been seeking further expansion by acquiring consultants and other services companies, including banks or financial services concerns. In the past few months, Saatchi also has taken several steps to reorganize and streamline the stable of ad agencies acquired in recent years.    Mr. Sinclair, 40 years old, relinquished his duties as chairman of an advertising unit, Saatchi andamp; Saatchi International, based here. He assumes responsibility for the overall group's corporate communications, a new duty. The company didn't name a successor to Mr. Sinclair.    Mr. Woods, 43, remains based in New York as chairman of the U.S. holding unit Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Inc. He also becomes responsible for the group's planning and longer-term development, Saatchi said.    Its first non-executive board member is Vanni Treves, 46, a partner in the London law firm of Macfarlanes and a trustee of several major trusts, including Getty Trust. Maurice Saatchi, the group's chairman, said Saatchi andamp; Saatchi has known Mr. Treves &quot;for some years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
