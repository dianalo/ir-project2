And the futurepromises even lower prices -- and more sophisticatedmachines.</LP><TEXT>   Equipping a basic home office costs under $4,000, and evena lavish setup is under $10,000. Here's a list of some of theitems that most home businesses are likely to buy today, withprices culled from recent advertisements.                                                                                                          Basic Needs                                                                                                          IBM-compatible personal computer -- $1,000   Prices have dropped sharply during most of the past sixmonths, and the most basic machines can be had for under$500. But much of the best software today requires a harddisk instead of cheaper floppy disks. The minimum computertoday should include an Intel 80286 processor, a 20-megabytehard disk and a monochrome monitor. Prices will keep dropping30% a year.                                                                                                          Letter-quality printer -- $270   The 24-pin models print characters almost as well aselectric typewriters do.                                                                                                          Answering machine -- $70   After a telephone, the most important single item for anyhome business.                                                                                                          Facsimile machine -- $480   The most basic models don't cut the paper or dial numbersautomatically, but they get the job done.                                                                                                          Two-line telephone -- $120   A must, unless you want to risk annoying clients with busysignals or with constant requests to hold on while you answeryour call-waiting line.                                                                                                          Computer modem -- $100   The 2400-baud versions save lots of money when sendingelectronic mail.                                                                                                          High-Powered Office                                                                                                          More powerful personal computers -- $3,099   PCs with 100-megabyte hard disks will run faster and aremore likely to accommodate software packages that come out inthe future. Home workers say that the bigger the hard disk,the better off you are.   Hard-disk prices have been plunging lately. Color monitorsdon't make much difference in the business, but they make thekids' educational software look great -- and that's one ofthe benefits of having a home office.                                                                                                          Tape drive -- $380   When all your business information is on your computer,you need to back it up at least weekly. Keep the tape in thecar or elsewhere out of the house.                                                                                                          Laser printers -- $995   They let users print out headlines, different fonts, andgraphs and charts that look professionally produced. They arealmost silent and print at four to six pages a minute. Oncelimited to print shops, they fell below $1,000 last fall.                                                                                                          Personal copiers -- $530   They're much less common in home offices than in corporateoffices. In emergencies, a fax machine can be used to make acopy. And big jobs still require a trip to the print shop.                                                                                                          Facsimile machine -- $800   You might want one that includes an answering machine thatswitches automatically to voice or fax.
