The unit, Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, received a $151.5 million capital infusion from its Los Angeles-based parent in conjunction with admitting violations of state insurance law. It also paid a $250,000 fine, which equals the highest fine ever levied by the New York State Insurance Department.    The cash infusion into Executive Life, based in suburban Jericho, Long Island, was part of an agreement with the state insurance department. The funds make up for a like amount of credits that the state said the company wasn't entitled to take on its 1983 to 1985 regulatory accounting statements. The credits involved annuity-related obligations the company transferred to reinsurance companies.    In a written agreement released by the state, Executive Life of New York admitted to violating eight sections of the insurance law. An insurance department official said the size of the penalty &quot;speaks of the very serious nature of the violations committed.&quot;    First Executive, whose leading subsidiary is Executive Life Insurance Co., in Los Angeles, has long been a controversial company. The principal reason is its large holdings of so-called &quot;junk,&quot; or below investment-grade, securities used to finance takeovers.    First Executive may be feeling fallout from anti-takeover sentiment that has been fanned by the federal government's insider-trading investigation. One analyst, who asked not to be named, speculated that the New York insurance department may have treated Executive Life in a &quot;heavy-handed&quot; way because it already has objections to the New York unit's junk-bond holdings. Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman, declined comment on that suggestion.    The state insurance department highlighted the large junk-bond holdings of the unit when it recently proposed a regulation to limit such holdings. In an unrelated matter in 1984, the insurance department fined the unit $100,000 for not cooperating with examiners.    Mr. Carr said the capital infusion won't have any impact on the parent company's earnings. Analysts said they didn't expect the transaction to have a significant effect on the parent's overall capital position or on its ability to continue its recent pattern of rapid growth.    Mr. Carr said &quot;the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries remains substantial and very adequate.&quot;    First Executive stock fell 25 cents a share, to $18.50, in heavy national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    Reinsurance treaties, under which insurers pay fees to transfer some of their future claims obligations to other insurers, are a standard part of the insurance marketplace. They enable insurers to spread risk. The reduction in liabilities also translates into an increase in net worth as calculated for regulatory purposes -- an attraction to fast-growing insurers such as First Executive that need capital to support expansion.    According to the New York regulators, however, Executive Life of New York took credits for reinsurance agreements that provided less protection to the insurer and its policyholders than New York rules require.    The department said the reinsurance agreements had various provisions that could limit the ability of Executive Life of New York and its policyholders to receive payment if claims were made to reinsurers. The state therefore disallowed the credits the company had taken in relation to those agreements.    The company also failed to file certain forms and receive regulatory approvals and, in a few instances, took credits for treaties that were never executed, regulators said.    In its agreement with the state, Executive Life of New York said it believed the disputed treaties were in compliance with New York rules at the time it entered into them. It said some of the other violations &quot;were the result of inadvertence on its part and clerical error.&quot;    Analysts said company officials complained to them that the New York regulators applied retroactively some tighter rules on reinsurance that took effect in 1985. Mr. Carr declined comment. An insurance department official said such a suggestion is &quot;categorically untrue.&quot;    Mr. Carr said the capital infusion for the New York unit came from Los Angeles-based Executive Life. He noted that First Executive has &quot;put capital in continuously&quot; to both the California and New York insurers &quot;over a long period of time&quot; to support their rapid growth. In 1986, he said, First Executive put $120 million into the New York unit alone. </TEXT></DOC>
