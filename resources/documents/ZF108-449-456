(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The local area network marketplace is huge, and it's growing rapidly.andP;  Moreand more companies are connecting more and more PCs and Macintoshes tonetworks; most of the major computer vendors-IBM, ATandamp;T, Compaq,Hewlett-Packard have announced comprehensive products and/or systems thatmake networking a vital part of their strategies for growth in the 1990s.andO;And we're even seeing advertisements for network products in majormetropolitan general-circulation newspapers.andM;But just how big is the LAN industry? How &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;wide&quot; is it? What areasare buyers flocking to? What kinds of products do they plan to Purchase thisyear or the next? Are they looking at Unix or a PC-based solution? And howbig a piece of the proverbial network operating system (NOS) pie does Novellreally control with Netware?andM;These are the kinds of questions that LAN vendors in search of sales and  theever-important  &quot;market share&quot; regularly ask market research firms to answer.andO;And answer they do-often in volume upon volume, most paid for by those askingthe questions.andP;  This produces a huge compendium of often-conflicting numbers,numbers that, yes, can be fine-tuned to your own outlook.andM;The only problem is, the answers keep changing as buying patterns shiftrapidly in reaction to equally rapid changes in technology.andP;  This, in turn,forces the market research industry to continually regenerate and reevaluateraw data and interpret what the data means for its customers.andM;We'll take a look at some of this data and-with some help from a few marketresearch firms-try to make some sense of the overall size, breadth, depth,and direction of the local and wide area networking industry.andM;It's a Big MarketandM;Just how big is the LAN market? Quite big, according to &quot;PC LAN OpportunitiesThrough 1991: Summary Report,&quot; an &quot;executive summary,&quot; condensation of a moredetailed study released this year by Salomon Brothers, the New YorkCity-based securities firm.andP;  The study says that the worldwide LANmarketplace grew to $4.68 billion in 1989 (see Figure 1), up from $2.40billion in 1987 and $3.57 billion in 1988.andP;  Furthermore, Salomon Brothersexpects the PC LAN industry sales to expand to $5.64 billion this year and to$5.90 billion in 1991.andM;&quot;The PC LAN market is booming in some technology subsectors but is mature anddeclining in others,&quot; the report states.andP;  &quot;As the PC LAN market increases insize and as large subsectors of this market decline (such as adapter boardsand proprietary servers), the year-to-year growth rate is deceleratingrapidly.andP;  PC LAN spending increased year over year by 48.7 percent in 1988and by 30.6 percent in 1989.andP;  We project a .andP;  .  .  21.0 percent gain [in1990, with) 1991 customer spending up only 4.5 percent.&quot;andM;High-growth areas, according to Salomon Brothers, include PC LAN operatingsystems offering Unix, IBM PC and Apple connectivity, internet work routers,and products that allow using unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling withEthernet and Token Ring networks.andM;No surprises there, particularly regarding the predicted growth in the use ofUTP-anyone who's attended a LAN industry trade show, read any tradepublications, or talked with corporate buyers of networking products is awareof the popularity of telephone wiring in LAN installations.andP;  (More about eachof these subjects later.)andM;Salomon Brothers' report reveals a number of other interesting statistics.andO;For example, Salomon says that IBM (not too surprisingly) &quot;overshadows all PCLAN market participants&quot; with 23 percent of the 1989 worldwide LAN sales.andO;Novell (Provo, Utah) and 3Com (Santa Clara, Calif.) follow IBM with 13.5percent and 13.4 percent, respectively, of worldwide PC LAN sales.andM;The installed BaseandM;Another study, this one from Market Research Intelligence Corp. (MIRC) ofMountain View, Calif., in its 1989 &quot;Local Area Network Market&quot; report, notes,&quot;The market for LANS, particularly PC LANS, has been growing explosivelysince 1986.andP;  The large installed base of stand-alone PCs is fueling thisgrowth; nearly 30 million have been installed worldwide by the end of 1988.&quot;andO;Only 12 percent of those are connected to a host or via a PC LAN, the reportadds.andM;The report, which is available for a fee from Electronic Trend Publications(Saratoga, Calif.), indicates there will be 31.8 million PC LAN nodesinstalled by 1993, up from an estimated 7.8 million in 1988.andP;  By then, morethan 50 percent of all PCs will be connected  via  networks,  MIRC projects.andM;MIRC'S report predicts that the primary LAN growth area will be in Token Ringnetworks: In 1988, new Ethernet connections outnumbered new Token Ringconnections 1.45 million to .3 million, according to the study; by 1993, newToken Ring connections will be up to 1.9 million a year versus 2.88 millionfor Ethernet.andP;  This makes for a 64 percent compound annual growth rate forToken Ring, with only 15 percent for Ethernet.andP;  Arcnet connections, the thirdother major player&quot; in the media-access field, are expected to grow 28percent, from .275 million to .96 million connections.andM;Helping fuel this growth will be a steady decline in the price per networknode, according to Market intelligence Research.andP;  The cost of an Ethernetconnection should drop from $550 per node in 1988 to $300 per node in 1993;similar declines should occur in Token Ring, both for 4 Mbps ($775 to $475)and 16 Mbps ($1,200 to $925) connections.andM;The report also broke the cost of Ethernet connections down by media type;the cost of connecting a twisted pair Ethernet node will actually rise from$125 in 1988 to $300 in 1993.andM;Arcnet connections will similarly decline in costs, from $200 to $100 pernode for a 2.5 Mbps connection; the cost of a 20 Mbps Arcnet connection,which was not available in 1988 but will be this year for $800 per node,should drop to $600 by 1993.andM;Fiber-optic connections will continue to cost less-the forecast sees a dropfrom $900 to  650-but the cost of 100 Mbps Fiber Distributed Data Interface(FDDI) links won't decline substantially-from $7,000 per node in 1990 to$5,500 in 1993.andM;Network connections made via RS-232 ports, often called zero-slot LANSbecause they do not require a network interface card-they use a serialport-will continue to be the most inexpensive way to link computers, costing$125 in 1988, only $75 in 1993.andP;  There's another price to pay for thiseconomy, however: RS-232 connections are limited to 19.0 to 115 Kilobits persecond (Kbps) compared to 10 Mpbs for Ethernet, 16 Mbps for the high-speedToken Ring technology, and 20 Mbps for the new Arcnet adapters.andM;The Market NichesandM;As these numbers would indicate, the LAN marketplace isn't a cohesive,single-product entity; it's easily broken down into a wide variety ofcategories, statistically, from network operating system type to serversales, to bridges and routers to repeaters and wiring.andM;The Salomon Brothers report noted earlier breaks down the worldwide PC LANmarketplace into several product-specific categories, including networkoperating systems, LAN interface adapters, proprietary servers, bridges androuters, and overall physical-layer (i.e., cable and wiring) components,including adapters.andM;Overall, the 1989 worldwide LAN market was $4.66 billion, the SalomonBrothers report notes; 35.9 percent of this figure was made up of adaptercards, 20.1 percent network operating system sales (see Figure 3).andO;Proprietary servers,  such  as  3Com's 3+Server line, made up the nextlargest market share at 19.4 percent.andM;The Market Intelligence Research report reveals a different set of numbersfor LAN sales.andP;  MIRC estimated that worldwide revenue for all kinds ofLAN-basedandM;components-including multiuser computers-was $3.9 billion for 1989, $8.1billion in 1993; this is a 22 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).andO;For PC LAN components, the numbers are $1.7 billion in '89, $2.8 billion in'93, a 16.6 CAGR.andM;Unit shipments, according to MIRC, were 1.3 million (for all types of LANS)and.5 million (for PC LANS only) in 1989; those numbers should climb to 2million and 1.2 million, respectively, by 1993.andP;  In the U.S., MIRC sees unitshipments of 797,000 in 1993, with a total installed base of 3.3 million PCLANS.andM;The NOS MarketandM;Salomon Brothers says the worldwide market for LAN network operating systemswas $934 million in 1989 (up from $685 million in 1988 and $434 million in1987); it should expand to $1.12 billion this year, $1.36 billion in 1991.andO;The greater majority of these sales comes in PC/Macintosh environments-$823million worth in 1989; the Macintosh-only NOS market was only $67 millionthat year, according to Salomon Brothers.andM;Worldwide NOS sales by manufacturer reveal the expected: Novell owns 55percent of the market (see Figure 5), with 3Com (13 percent) and IBM (12percent) a distant second and third.andP;  in dollar sales volume, SalomonBrothers estimated that Novell did $515 million in NOS business, 3Com $120million, and IBM $110 million.andM;Other not-so-major &quot;players&quot; in the NOS arena include Banyan with 6 percent($60 million in sales) and TOPS/SUN (now TOPS alone) and Apple with 3 percenteach ($32 million and $30 million, respectively).andM;The File Server ArenaandM;Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market researcher, offers some intriguingforecasts about the growth in the PC file server and NIC markets.andP;  While itforesees both as areas of strong growth, the NIC market, particularly thatfor Token Ring adapters, is expected to soar.andM;Let's look at the file server numbers first, however.andP;  Dataquest estimatesthat 168,000 servers were shipped worldwide in 1988 (see Figure 6); thegreater majority-123,000, or about 73 percent-were installed, notsurprisingly, in U.S.andP;  networks.andP;  The growth of networking elsewhere in theworld, especially Europe, can be readily seen in the progression of numbersproduced by Dataquest.andP;  In 1990, the U.S.andP;  share drops to 63 percent; 214,000U. S.andP;  shipments versus 314,000 worldwide-and by 1993 it should be down to 60percent, or 313,000 out of 528,000.andM;Worldwide, this represents a 19.6 percent CAGR; nationally, server growthuntil 1993 will be 15.9 percent, notes Dataquest.andP;  The Expanding Token RingandM;Market researchers have for years forecast the slow demise of Ethernet andthe ascendance of Token Ring, a predominantly IBM arena.andP;  Dataquest agrees,predicting that shipments of Token Ring network interface boards will surpassthose of Ethernet in 1991.andP;  By then, Token Ring will own 41 percent of themarket compared to 40 percent for Ethernet (see Figure 10); in unit-shipmentnumbers, Dataquest says 4.3 million Token Ring NICS will be sold in 1991compared with 4.2 million Ethernet boards.andM;By 1992, 45 percent of the NIC sales will be for Token Ring cards; thatfigure will be 46 percent in 1993.andM;As noted earlier, numbers can be deceiving, and this area offers a primeexample because Ethernet's market share isn't expected to erode substantiallyas a result of Token Ring's growth.andP;  A close look at Dataquest's forecastshows that in 1988, Ethernet had 41.5 percent of the NIC market and 42percent in 1989, and should have 41 percent this year and 40 percent in 1991,1992, and 1993.andM;Thus, Token Ring's growth should come at the expense of those technologies inthe &quot;other&quot; category, presumably Arcnet and an assortment of proprietaryLANS; Dataquest, noting that &quot;those vendors in the PC LAN market segment withproprietary products will face stiff competition against products based onstandards,&quot; predicts that the &quot;others...andP;  share of the NIC market shoulddwindle from 38 percent in 1988 to 14 percent in 1993.andM;As evidence, Dataquest points out that in 1987, Wang, one of  severallong-time vendors of proprietary facility LANS,&quot; offered support for standardLAN technologies.andM;Overall, Dataquest sees a 31.8 percent growth rate for NIC sales from 1989through 1993; Token Ring NIC shipments should climb at a49 percent rateversus 30.2 percent CAGR for Ethernet during that time frame.andM;Salomon Brothers offers total worldwide NIC dollar-sales figures thatgenerally mimic Dataquest's findings.andP;  One major difference: Salomon saysthat total dollar sales of Token Ring products have already surpassed thoseof Ethernet, posting $769 million versus $7 10 million in 1989 (see Figure8).andP;  This is consistent with the Dataquest numbers because Token Ringadapters are generally more expensive-often, by as much as $100 or more  per board-than Ethernet adapters.andP;  Hence, fewer Token Ring units can indeed equalgreater dollar sales.andM;IBM'S virtual stronghold on Token Ring adapter sales has played a major rolein driving overall Token Ring sales; with 23 percent of the 1989 worldwideLAN sales.andP;  Novell (Provo, Utah) and 3Com (Santa Clara, Calif.) follow IBMwith 13.5 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively, of worldwide PC LAN sales.andM;The installed BaseandM;Another study, this one from Market Research Intelligence Corp.

35.9 percent of this figure was made up of adaptercards, 20.1 percent network operating system sales (see Figure 3).andO;Proprietary servers,  such  as  3Com's 3+Server line, made up the nextlargest market share at 19.4 perandM;The Market Intelligence Research report reveals a different set of numbersfor LAN sales.andP;  MIRC estimated that worldwide revenue for all kinds ofLan-basedandM;components-including multiuser computers-was  3.9 billion for 1989, $8.1billion in 1993; this is a 22 percent compound annual growth rate (CAG R).andO;For PC LAN components, the numbers are $1.7 billion in '89, $2.8 with morethan 90 percent of the Token Ring NIC market, IBM is in a strong position toresist most downward pressure on the price of its adapter boards.andM;By 1991, Salomon sees Token Ring NIC sales at $1.054 billion.andP;  Ethernetsales, meanwhile are expected to peak out in 1990 at $814 million beforedeclining somewhat in 1991 to $789 million.andM;Like Dataquest, Salomon Brothers expects much of Token Ring's growth to comeat the expense of the others&quot; in the adapter market; the firm's figures showsales of these NIC products declining from a high of $382 million in 1987down to only $60 million in 1991.andM;The UTP ConnectionandM;No longer is coaxial cable the media of choice for Ethernet connections.andO;Dataquest's forecast for the sale of NICS by media type-coax, unshieldedtwisted-pair (UTP), and fiberoptic cable-offers no great surprises.andP;  By 1993,the San Jose market research firm believes 78 percent of Ethernet connectionswill be made via twisted pair wire.andM;Twisted-pair connections numbered only 127,000 in 1988, according toDataquest; that was a tiny 9 percent of the Ethernet media market.andP;  Steadygrowth pushed this up to 450,000 in 1989 (20 percent of the market), and UTPshould take over 33 percent, with 1.06 million shipments, this year.andP;  By1993, 5.01 million UTP units will be shipped; this works out to an astounding82.7 percent growth rate.andM;Fueling this growth are a number of factors, including the ability to use thealready installed telephone cable in many installations.andP;  Another key factoris the centralized topology used by UTP cabling networks.andP;  Centralization ofthe network repeater technology greatly facilitates managing, expanding, andcontrolling Ethernets.andM;Dataquest, meanwhile, expects coaxial cable shipments to slip gradually toonly 20 percent of the market by 1993; this represents a -7.2 CAGR.andM;Fiber-optic cable's share of the market will remain small, barely surpassing1.4 percent in 1993, according to Dataquest, which sees the overall Ethernetmarket growing at a 30 percent CAGR.andM;Another Growth AreaandM;Yet another booming LAN market: Internetworking, or the building of so called&quot;enterprisewide&quot;  networks.andP;  This interconnection of LANS to LANS and LANS tothe corporate mainframe propelled the sales of bridges, routers, and gatewaysat an 83 percent CAGR from 1987 to 1989, according to Market IntelligenceResearch.andM;Only 10 percent to 12 percent of overall LAN revenues came from internetworking products in 1988, notes MIRC; it expects that figure to grow to 75percent by 1993.andM;Spearheading this growth will be the sales of remote bridges and routers,according to Salomon Brothers; total sales of remote bridges, which link LANSof similar types-two Ethernets, for example-to each other over high-speedtelecommunications lines, are expected to grow to $186 million in 1991, upfrom $84 million in 1987.andM;Routers, which selectively forward data from different protocols-from anEthernet to a Token Ring, for example-should enjoy even greater success:Salomon Brothers says sales should climb from $15 million in 198 to $196million in 1991.andM;On the Software SideandM;While the hardware marketplace may grab the dollars-it is generally moreexpensive to develop, manufacture, and market a chips-plastics-and metalpiece of equipment than to develop software-software sales are importantLan-related growth areas, of course.andM;Market Research Intelligence reports that the LAN application software markethas climbed from $55 million in 1984 to $234 million in 1987, and should growto exceed $1 billion in 1991, $4.1 billion in 1994 (see Table 3).andM;&quot;Within this boom, growth will be especially strong in the vertical industrymarket segment,&quot; Market Research intelligence noted.andP;  &quot;Strong growth willalso occur in the large database  and  text  handling segments.&quot;andM;Data processing (28 percent) and text-handling (21 percent) applications willmake up a combined 49 percent of the LAN application software market in 1994,says MIRC.andM;The Unix MarketandM;As users search for more powerful software solutions, the Unix operatingsystem should continue as a growth area in the 1990s, according to theinternational Technology Group, a Los Altos, Calif., market research firmthat specializes in the Unix and other niche market areas.andM;In &quot;Unix Directions,&quot; a subscription-only newsletter, the InternationalTechnology Group, estimated that the 1989 U.S.andP;  Unix market was $5.63billion.andP;  Of this figure, 47 percent, or $2.65 million, was associated withworkstations &quot;employed predominantly for engineering/scientificapplications,&quot;  according to  the newsletter.andM;&quot;The vast majority of single-user Unix usage is workstation-like, andconcentrated in engineering/scientific application,&quot; the newslettercontinues.andP;  &quot;The reason why Unix is widely regarded as a  PC' operatingsystem challenger appears to be that many analysts have failed to recognizethat Xenix [the PC version of Unix) popularity is primarily as a multi-userrather than single-user solution.&quot;andM;The  International  Technology Group believes that the so-called &quot;corporatemarket&quot; for Unix-based applications-that is, accounting, databases, etc.-hasproved  an irresistible myth.andP;  Despite numerous targeting attempts by[software] vendors over the years, there has proved to be little demand forUnix-based systems for  generic' office and departmental applications among Fortune 500 users.andM;&quot;This  situation  reflects  the broader collapse of demand in corporateAmerica since 1986 for mid-range systems,&quot; the editors of &quot;Unix Directions&quot;note.andP;  &quot;The reality is that the Fortune 500 has moved heavily toward PC/LANconfigurations and away from the minicomputer- and superminicomputer-basedsystems for a wide range of applications.&quot;andM;As Figure 13 shows, commercial engineering and the scientific applicationsand hardware sales are the largest Unix market segment, at 40.7 percent;government spending is the next largest area, at almost 22 percent.andP;  Small-to medium-sized business outlay is third, prompting the editors of &quot;UnixDirections&quot; to state that this area &quot;is surprisingly neglected by Unixvendors and analysts, particularly given its relatively high growth rate andlong-term sales potential.&quot;andM;The editors of &quot;Unix Directions&quot; took close-up looks at all of the key Unixniches, pointing out a number of trends that vendors of Unix-based productswould be wise to note.andM;For instance, they divided the U.S.andP;  federal government market into what theytermed &quot;industry vertical&quot; markets.andP;  &quot;Example of these  markets' includeaccounting (the U.S.andP;  government employs more accountants' that the  Big CPA'firms combined), retail POS [point of sale] systems (installed at governmentcommissaries, financial services, hospitality, education, andtransportation,&quot; the ITC report says.andM;When it included the federal government's engineering and scientific spendingwith non-government spending for these services, &quot;Unix Directions&quot; discoveredthat 62 the total Unix market-that's the $5.63 billion noted earlier-goes toengineering and scientific applications.andM;One surprising note in the &quot;Unix Directions&quot; report: Corporate businessspending accounted for &quot;no more than $519 million or 9.2 percent&quot; of thetotal U.S.andP;  Unix market.andP;  The ITC researchers commented that most corporateUnix systems have &quot;tended to be in industry-specific applications involvingnetworking of remote sites.andP;  The predominantly industry-specific segment hasbeen retail and (to a lesser extent), wholesale distribution.andP;  This is partlydue to the activities of vendors such as NCR and Unisys with establishedbusinesses in this area.&quot;andM;ITC calls the small-to-medium business segment &quot;the largest single area ofU.S.andP;  'commercial' usage of Unix systems,&quot; accounting for $687 million, or12.2 percent of the U.S.andP;  Unix total and 57 percent of the commercial Unixtotal.andM;&quot;The vast majority of all Unix systems sales in this segment are throughvalued-added reseller (VAR), OEM and two-tier distribution channels .andP;  . andO;.vendors such as ATandamp;T, NCR and Unisys are the main players in this segment.&quot;andM;ITC also observes that one of &quot;the most striking aspects of Unix penetrationin this segment is that ...andP;  turnkey resellers and software houses, multiusersystems have more appeal than the PC/LAN configurations increasingly favoredin the  Fortune 500' market.andP;  This reflects the generally more conservativenature of small/medium business users, and their preference for relativelysimple, reliable solutions to perform conventional accounting and businessmanagement tasks.&quot;andM;A Little FailureandM;Infonetics, a Santa Clara, Calif., market research company, in 1989 undertooka survey of network downtime that reveals several interesting points.andP;  Thestudy, titled, &quot;The Cost of LAN Downtime,&quot; and available for a fee fromInfonetics, showed that network size didn't necessarily dictate how often thenetwork went down.andM;In its executive summary to that report, Infonetics commented, &quot;Surprisingly,although the number of network devices is increasing dramatically,respondents [in its survey] believe that the number of network disabilitiesis diminishing over time.&quot; Actual statistical correlations between the numberof network devices versus the actual number of disabilities proved otherwise,however.andP;  &quot;It is possible that the respondents believe that integratednetwork management technology will account for a diminishing number ofnetwork disabilities,&quot; Infonetics added.andM;Infonetics' survey found that the average campus-wide LAN .andP;  .  .  iscompletely or partially disabled 6 percent of the time, based on 2,080 hoursin the &quot;working year,&quot; an average of 23.6 network disabilities per year, andan average network disability  .andP;  .  .of 4.9 hours.&quot;andM;Among Infonetics other findings: 9 Companies lose $3.48 million a year inemployee productivity due to LAN downtime; 9 Revenue loss averages $606,000per year; 9 The average company spend only $60,000 a year on LAN maintenance;9 Fortune 1000 companies spend more than $650,000 a year in LAN performanceupgrades.andP;  A ConclusionandM;Enough numbers.andP;  Suffice it to note that the LAN marketplace has come a longway since 1984; most likely, we'll be able to report even greater growth ayear from now.andP;  We might even report that LAN Manager has made inroadsagainst Netware in the operating system wars.andP;  Probably not, but in such arapidly evolving marketplace, just about anything seems possible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
