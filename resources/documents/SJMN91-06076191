But they all highlight the past, not thepresent, and some of the figures, such as the unemployment rate, are so-calledlagging indicators that will continue to deteriorate well after the economyhas rebounded.;    Evidence that the recession is ending -- in Silicon Valley,at least -- is popping up most everywhere. Consider:;    (check) Thesemiconductor industry's widely watched book-to-bill ratio, a comparison oforders to sales, spiked sharply in February after an eight-month downtrend.The ratio stood at 1.09, up from 0.96 in January, which meant that chip makerswere finally getting new orders at a slightly faster rate than they wereshipping semiconductors. Several analysts say this marks the start of aturnaround in the industry.;    (check) Business equipment spending, thelifeblood of Silicon Valley, is slowly showing new signs of life. The WEFAGroup, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic consulting firm, says it will grow 3.3percent after inflation this year, up from 2.7 percent in 1990, and then growmore than twice as fast in 1992. One big plus will be the introduction laterthis year of a new generation of mainframe computers by International BusinessMachines Corp., Hitachi Data Systems and Amdahl Corp., which could generatetotal sales of up to $50 billion.;    &quot;We see a lot of pent-up demand forthese products, if for no other reason than that they're at least twice aspowerful as existing mainframes,&quot; said Stephen Cohen, a computer industryanalyst at Soundview Financial Group, a Stamford, Conn., brokerage firm.;   (check) The California Peninsula franchise of Manpower Inc., the temporaryhelp firm, is seeing a turnaround in business after more than a seven-monthslump. Placements, which had been down about 20 percent, have rebounded nearly15 percent this month. Temporary workers are the first to be fired in a slumpand the first to be hired in a recovery, and Manpower President Bob Lee saysthe most promising sign is requests for human resource managers.;    &quot;Thisshows that companies are gearing up to hire,&quot; Lee said.;    (check) The homemarket rebounded crisply in February and is expected to maintain its momentum.According to the San Jose Real Estate Board, pending sales jumped 42 percentin February to 1,304, and the median price of homes sold in Santa Clara Countyrose $7,750 to $225,000. John Pinto, the board's immediate past president,said home sales will continue to strengthen, bolstered by pent-up demand,lower mortgage rates and the start of the spring sales season, the strongestof the year.;    &quot;March will definitely be stronger than February, just asFebruary was stronger than January,&quot; Pinto said. &quot;If homes are priced fairly,they are selling well again across the board.&quot;;    (check) New signs of lifeare stirring in retailing, which is starting to recover after the worstChristmas shopping season in eight years. Ross Stores Inc., the Newark-basedoff-price retailer, said comparable-store sales rose 5 percent in Februaryover February 1990, the best showing in more than a year. Last year, Ross'store-for-store sales declined 3 percent.;    Albert Aguiar, a suburbanSacramento retailing consultant and a former senior vice president of Macy'sCalifornia, predicted that many retailers will post gains at least comparableto those at Ross starting next month. &quot;The Persian Gulf war hurt business,&quot;Aguiar said. &quot;But it's over, and consumer confidence is rising. People willstart buying what they had postponed because of uncertainty.&quot;;    (check) Anostensibly negative sign -- the local unemployment rate -- isn't as bad as itappears. Santa Clara County's jobless rate rose from 4.8 percent in Decemberto 5.6 percent in January, a four-year high, and the California EmploymentDevelopment Department says it may rise as high as 6 percent in February. Butthe jobless rate almost always peaks early in the year, reflectingpost-Christmas retailing layoffs, and the EDD says the rate should drop backto the 5 percent range for the rest of the year.;    Although these rates aresomewhat higher than usual, they are low by recession standards.;   Economists say the economy is coming out of recession for a variety ofreasons. The end of the Persian Gulf war is having a beneficial impact onconsumer confidence, they say, and the Federal Reserve Board has beenaggressively cutting interest rates since last summer. They also note that oilprices have fallen dramatically and are likely to fall more, that U.S. exportshave remained strong, and that business inventories have remained very lean.;   &quot;When business improves a little more, manufacturers will have to startmaking goods very rapidly because they don't have anything extra on theirshelves to sell,&quot; said Kurt Karl, a senior economist at the WEFA Group. &quot;Thismay turn out to be the most mild recession we have ever had.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVE KAUFMAN, Business Monday Editor  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910316  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  897  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 16, 199100076191,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
