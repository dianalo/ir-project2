We need more officers looking at cargo. We need more canineteams. ... We need more technology.''   The president Thursday proposed a $1.1 billion increase indrug-fighting funds on a wide variety of fronts, including newspending in five high-priority areas: New York, Miami, Houston, LosAngeles and the Mexican border area from Texas to California.   Piatt said the mere designation of Houston and the border asdrug target areas was very important.   ``What that's going to do is beyond whatever additional moneyHouston gets with this drug strategy, what it's going to do is addfocus. All the various federal agencies are going to realizethey're going to have to put more resources into these areas towork on this drug problem. So I think there are going to be a lotof spinoff benefits.''   He called Houston ``a conduit for smuggling across the border.... There's a lot of drug drug money that's floating around. To theextent that we can work on joint money laundering projects, a lotof that money can go right back to the city.''   On the technology side, he suggested that ``There's got to be away we can X-ray vehicles and trucks. That would certainly make usfar more effective than we are now.''   In Miami, Customs Commissioner Carol Hallet said she was``delighted'' with the new initiative.   ``We are in this war to win it and Customs, the Coast Guard andthe DEA will help us see an end to this scourge that is a globalproblem.''   ``We will study the high intensity areas to see what needs to bedone.''   The new federal funds includes increases for education andtreatment, but the focus in the Miami region will continue to be onhalting drug shipments, Ms. Hallet said.   Customs, she said, will ``continue to be the lead agency when itcomes to interdiction on the land. We will be adding not onlyagents but additional inspectors and K-9 teams.''   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez said he has always been pleased withfederal help in anti-drug efforts in the region, but wished the newmoney would give local officials had more say in how it was spent.   ``We'd like to have some discretion on the use of the money,''he said.   Two Southern California congressmen said the declaration of LosAngeles County as a high-intensity drug trafficking area was a longoverdue step.   Rep. Mel Levine said the Bush administration ``seems tounderstand the seriousness and magnitude of the drug problem facingLos Angeles County'' but must allocate even more resources to thearea.   ``The resources announced today are woefully inadequate and needto be dramatically increased,'' Levine said in a statement.   Rep. Howard Berman, who like Levine is a Democrat, said theadministration should have taken the step a year ago and in themeantime much ground was lost.   ``I hope the administration realizes that, excellent as this is,it's jut a start,'' Berman said.   In New York, Mary Cooper, a spokeswoman for the New York regionof the Drug Enforcement Administration, said officials in heroffice were meeting Thursday to discuss the anticipated extra funds.   And New York City police Sgt. Ralph St. Just said if any of thefunds make it to the local level, that's when NYPD will decide.``We've got to have it in our possession before we decide whatwe're going do with it,'' said St. Just.</TEXT></DOC>
