In such immigrant meccas as Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago, the once-languid program has seen a surge of applicants during its twilight -- about 25,000 a day. The feverish last-minute pace was marked by concern that applicants who could never qualify were filing claims in an effort to win temporary work authorization cards -- one immediate byproduct to filing.    Thus far, nearly 1.4 million illegal immigrants, mostly Mexicans, have applied for amnesty with claims of near-continuous residence in the U.S. beginning before Jan. 1, 1982. The Immigration and Naturalization Service had estimated two million persons would apply and that as many as 3.9 million were eligible.    In Houston, lines of families wrapped around the shopping mall that houses the legalization center. Some even snapped photos as a memento. Vendors pitched 50-cent confections popular in Mexico to the crowd, while attorneys pitched $100-a-person legalization services from a trailer across the street. Many immigrants cited lack of money for the $185-a-person application fee and difficulty in obtaining documents as the primary reasons for not applying until the last minute.    Estella Huerta, a 28-year-old Mexican native, eagerly awaited passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act in October of 1986 by saving rent receipts and the hospital bills from the births of her two U.S.-born toddlers. Then her purse, with those documents, was stolen.    Yesterday, Mrs. Huerta filed a trimmed-down application for amnesty. &quot;If you don't try, you don't gain,&quot; said the office-building janitor as she bounced her diapered baby on her hip.    In the final weeks, many other applicants across the country were giving the INS only skeletal applications, without the pay stubs, rent receipts or tax forms many others were required to use to prove their U.S residency. Under an INS rule change in mid-March, the government agreed to accept skeletal applications in an effort to increase the pool of applicants.    But the practice was raising concern that many immigrants were simply desperate to get the work authorization card, good for six months, as the job market tightened. In Houston and Los Angeles, social service workers feared many of these last-minute applicants simply didn't qualify.    &quot;I think it reflects their cultural experience with their own governments,&quot; said Maria Jimenez, director of an immigration project for the American Friends Service Committee. &quot;Fraud in Mexico may not have the same implications as it does here.&quot;    Moreover, illegal immigration, as measured by INS border apprehensions, has begun to creep up from 1987 levels. That's proof, in critics' eyes, that the much-ballyhooed amnesty program was no panacea.    The 12% increase in the first three months, however, is still substantially below the record apprehensions experienced in 1986, Border Patrol agents note. In the San Diego sector, the nation's busiest, apprehensions were up 20% for the month of April. In Texas, a Border Patrol spokesman speculated that 1987 apprehensions decreased about a third, in part, because of initial fears in Mexico of mass raids and deportations in the U.S. Those fears may be decreasing, said the government agent.    Indeed, at the border gateway of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Enrigue Lomas of the Center for Migratory Information and Studies gazed across a bus station parking lot and lamented that Mexico has &quot;lost its best people.&quot; Illegal immigration will continue, he said. &quot;What will be the reaction from Mexicans who have tasted the dollar for so many years, when and if they return to Mexico and taste the peso? They'll return immediately. Only a Berlin Wall or a Great Wall will keep them out.&quot;    For many, the wall will rise in the U.S. interior for the illegal immigrant-subclass, ever willing to work for cheap wages. For despite the INS pitch of &quot;no se quede atras,&quot; many immigrants undoubtedly will be left behind. Some immigration scholars estimate there will be as many as two illegal immigrants for every immigrant legalized.    Among them will be a worn-looking Santa Ana, Calif., resident who feeds his family by peddling sacks of fruits and peanuts along a busy street. He identified himself only as Virgilio, and his stubby, lined face attested to his fatigue. Certain that his wife wouldn't qualify, he didn't bother applying for amnesty. Besides, he said, &quot;'Soy pobre.' I'm poor.&quot;    Despite the fact that the INS expects to beef up its Border Patrol force to 4,000 agents from 2,900 in 1986, the merchant had no fears of the frequent &quot;sweeps&quot; performed by the INS in this city. &quot;I'm more afraid of going back to Mexico and me and my family going hungry,&quot; he said, pulling his tattered hat downward over his brow. </TEXT></DOC>
