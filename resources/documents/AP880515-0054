RABIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of Israelis attended ceremoniesSunday marking the 21st anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem'sArab sector. Arab stores observed a strike on what Palestinianprotesters called a ``day of calamity.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Jerusalem would remainIsrael's capital forever and said his government would never giveup the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967Middle East war.   Stores were shut throughout the occupied lands and in Arab EastJerusalem in response to an order by leaders of the 5-month-oldPalestinian uprising to mark a ``day of calamity.'' Only scatteredprotests were reported.   The army clamped a curfew on the Shati refugee camp in Gaza andthe village of Anabta in the West Bank after disturbances the nightbefore.   A 60-year-old Palestinian from Hebron died of a head woundsuffered in a beating four days ago, an official at the MoslemMukassad Hospital said Sunday.   Palestinians accused Jewish settlers of beating Ibrahim AbuAishe, but an army spokesman quoted Aishe's family as sayingPalestinians attacked the man for violating an earlier strikecalled by the underground leadership of the uprising.   The latest death raised to 188 the number of Palestinians killedsince the uprising began Dec. 8. A soldier and an Israeli teen-ageralso have died.   Israel radio quoted an Israeli legislator, Yair Tzaban of theleft-wing Mapam party, as saying high school students recently beatjailed Palestinians under the guidance of their paramilitary youthgroup commander. The army had no comment on the report.   Shamir spoke at a ceremony on Ammunition Hill, site of one ofthe fiercest battles in which Israel's army seized East Jerusalemfrom Jordan in 1967.   ``There are still those who shun Jerusalem,'' Shamir told acrowd of about 1,000. ``To all these we will say: Take your handsoff Jerusalem. No force in the world will change her destiny ... asIsrael's eternal capital and fortress of strength.''   Although Jerusalem is Israel's declared capital and the seat ofthe national government, few countries recognize it as such.   Throughout the festivities marking the Hebrew calendaranniversary of what Israelis call the city's reunification, therewere reminders of the Palestinian uprising.   At the Wailing Wall, the only remaining outer wall of thebiblical Jewish Temple and Judaism's holiest site, youngsters andorganized tour groups passed through rigorous security checks toenter the courtyard compound.   Police barred a group of Jewish extremists, followers ofAmerican Rabbi Meir Kahane, from visiting the Temple Mount to praySunday morning, Israel radio reported.   The hill is known in Arabic as Haram al-Sharif and contains theDome of the Rock, where Moslems believe Mohammed ascended to heaven.   Jews also consider the Temple Mount holy as the site of twoancient Jewish temples, one built by the biblical King Solomon.   In other developments Sunday:   _A military court sentenced Sgt. Maj.
