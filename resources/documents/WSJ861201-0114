James B. Sherwood, president, in a letter to shareholders said the company is undergoing a major reorganization and seeks to raise new capital, complete the disposal of shipping operations and sell some interests in its hotels.    The company earlier reported a loss of $912,000 for the third quarter on revenue of $18.8 million, and a loss of $26.3 million for the nine months on revenue of $42.5 million.    &quot;The company will incur a heavy loss this year but if our program of reorganization can be accomplished expeditiously and we are blessed with a normal year for tourism in 1987, we should be able to report a profit in 1987 and build on that in the years thereafter,&quot; he said.    In his letter, Mr. Sherwood said the company is seeking a &quot;full-time chief executive&quot; with a strong financial background.    When such a person is hired, Mr. Sherwood said he intends to become chairman, with a policy role rather than an operating role. He will remain chief executive of Sea Containers Ltd., a former subsidiary.    Proxy materials for the recent annual meeting indicated that a newly elected director, Georg R. Rafael, may be offered the position of president and chief executive. Mr. Rafael is a former top executive of Regent International Hotels Ltd., which operates hotels.    Mr. Sherwood declined to elaborate on the letter to shareholders.    Four of the ships currently chartered will be offered to Sea Containers. Earlier this year SeaCo, which changed its name in October to Orient-Express Hotels, took a $17 million provision for loss on disposal of container ship operations.    Until 1984, shares of SeaCo and Sea Containers traded together under the name Sea Containers Group, but the two companies split that year and SeaCo began concentrating on its tourist business, while Sea Containers remained in the shipping business.    Last June, SeaCo said Sea Containers was discussing a possible cash-and-stock acquisition of SeaCo, declaring that both companies believed SeaCo &quot;cannot operate satisfactorily in the long term as an independent company.&quot; SeaCo then hired Dillon, Read andamp; Co. to seek bids from possible buyers, including Sea Containers. In August, a group holding a 21.9% interest in SeaCo, including Mr. Sherwood, said it intended to take control of the board and end efforts to sell the company.    At the annual meeting in mid-October, non-management directors didn't seek reelection, and the company elected six new directors, including Mr. Rafael; Peter J. Pearson, managing director of Fidelity International Investment Management (H.K.) Ltd.; and Adrian W. L. Zecha, director of Arral andamp; Partners Ltd., an investment banking and holding company. Both concerns are in Hong Kong.    Other new directors are Sir John Bremridge, financial secretary of the government of Hong Kong from 1981 until 1986; David J. Davies, managing director of Hongkong Land Ltd., a property development company, from October 1983 until Aug. 31, 1986; and Marcus O.H.L. Birley, chairman and managing director of Annabel's (Berkeley Square) Ltd., a private club in London.    In his letter, Mr. Sherwood said he and other officials are seeking to raise $15 million to $20 million of new equity through a rights issue, and that major shareholders have expressed agreement in principle to subscribe to much of the new offering. Mr. Sherwood controls 13% of the company's shares.    The company also is seeking investors in the Lodge at Vail, a Vail, Colo., property, and in British hotels to free up capital. &quot;It is likely the company will retain a minority shareholding in these hotels,&quot; he said. The company operates 10 hotel properties, including five in Britain, three in Italy, and one each in the U.S. and the Bahamas. It also operates a luxury train service between London and Venice, manages a cruise ship, M.V. Orient Express, and operates other travel-related businesses.    Sea Containers is providing &quot;interim financial support to the company on a fully collateralized basis,&quot; pending sale of shares and some hotel assets, he said. The company's third-quarter financial report listed among current liabilities $8.5 million in notes payable to Sea Containers. </TEXT></DOC>
