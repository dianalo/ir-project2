However, the volumeof gas that must remain in the storage aquifer (base gas) is typicallylarge compared to the quantity that is available for withdrawal (workinggas). One way of improving the efficiency of gas storage operations isto keep the working gas closer to the withdrawal wells and to createa thicker gas saturated region. To achieve this, the mobility of theinjected gas must be controlled. The authors are investigating the feasibilityof using foam as a mobility control agent for gas storage operations.Specific concepts for using foam to improve gas storage operations rangefrom improved injection/withdrawal well performance to the potentialfor creating isolated underground storage regions. This paper describesthe efforts of the first year of the three-year research program thatis being sponsored by the Gas Research Institute. Laboratory studiesfor identifying suitable foams and for improving their knowledge of foambehavior are being carried out. In addition, a mathematical model forsimulating &quot;foam-protected&quot; gas storage operations and for designing&quot;foam-protected&quot; storage operations is being developed. Preliminary economicanalyses indicate a significant reduction in gas storage costs in a successfullyimplemented &quot;foam-protected&quot; aquifer gas storage operation.</TEXT></DOC>
