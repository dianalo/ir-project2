And &quot;Les Miz&quot; is by no means a flawless piece of work. But by the end of it, you are genuinely stirred by the suffering and courage of the poor people of Paris, and, by extension, of the poor people the world over fighting for a better life. At the end of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; you feel cheated. You sense that you're meant to be moved by the tribulations of the Joad family, and also by the thought of today's Okies, today's Hoovervilles, inescapable in any American city.    You know there's been a barrage of words and stage pictures intended to jolt you into emotion -- 11 scenes, 68 speaking parts, a square dance, a fit, a shooting, a birth, and more deaths than you can shake a stick at. You can see the designers and technicians have gone to tremendous trouble to give you a moving truck, several live campfires burning in trap doors, an honest-to-God &quot;river&quot; flowing in a downstage pit, and even a California rainstorm. The only thing you haven't had is the one thing theater can't do without: drama.    In a sense, Steppenwolf was asking for trouble simply by deciding to adapt this work. The fact that it had already been successfully turned into a movie (by John Ford in 1940) says nothing about its suitability for the stage. Moreover, the film was made in Hollywood, with Hollywood's usual disdain for its source material. Looking at Frank Galati's adaptation, you can almost hear him and his fellow Steppenwolves vowing to correct Hollywood's corny misrepresentation of the book, to be true to Steinbeck's harsh vision. But, as it happens, Steinbeck's novel is almost a textbook case of the kind of book that shouldn't be put on stage as is. There may well be a play, or several plays, in it somewhere. But trying to stage the whole novel seems almost perverse.    To begin with, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a story almost from first to last about nature in the raw, outdoors: about the dust storms that destroy the Joad family farm; about the sun beating down on their rickety home-made truck as they set out for Golden California; about the swelling fruit in the green orchards; about the downpours that signal the end of the harvest and the onset of pneumonia and starvation for the pickers.    Although Kevin Rigdon's set occasionally lets in the outdoors in the form of a starry sky, it is essentially an arrangement of planks, and the fires and rainfall do nothing to mitigate the feeling you get of the great indoors. Oklahoma looks just like Arizona looks just like California. The farm looks like the highway looks like the campsite looks like the orchard.    If the geography of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; challenges the resources of the theater, the book's characters are equally recalcitrant. In the pages of Steinbeck, the Joads are flat archetypes whose most notable characteristic is their ability to endure and endure and endure. Endurance is not theatrical. Neither is the kind of generic family that Steinbeck favors in so many of his books: Pa's in charge, Ma cooks and drops pearls of wisdom now and again, Tom and Al drive, Rose or Sharon waits for her baby to arrive. Even worse in terms of theatricality, they all are victims -- of the bank that threw them off the land, of the deceptive handbills that lured them west, of the exploitative locals along the route, of the slave wages and company stores in the fields.    When it becomes clear even to the stoical Ma and Pa that everything's been botched beyond repair, Pa asks, &quot;Couldn't we of did nothin'?&quot; And Ma replies, &quot;No. There was only one thing to do ever, and we done it.&quot; She's quite right, but people who have no choices don't make good stage heroes. We can't pull for them, we can't cry for them, we can only watch as they glumly go about doing what a man has to do.    In the film, the Joads and their companions were turned into a warm, earthy bunch by some of Hollywood's most appealing character actors. The Steppenwolf adaptation, by contrast, works hard to keep Steinbeck's laconic tone intact. As Tom Joad, Gary Sinise is stiff and pokerfaced. Lois Smith (Ma Joad) veers between the same tight-lipped toughness and something a little softer, a little, well, maternal. She positively beams when Mr. Sinise takes her for a turn on the dance floor at one of the camps, although she barely manages a smile when he comes home from jail. She injects real feeling into a few of her speeches, and you can't help wondering if those aren't the ones that Mr. Galati, who also directed the piece, isn't happy with.    As Jim Casy, the preacher who converts to collectivism, Terry Kinney is only slightly more animated than his colleagues. It's hard to picture him ever getting up the energy to bring down the Holy Spirit, much less organize a strike. And if he has trouble conveying a dynamic character, pity the poor actors who must make do with roles like &quot;Man,&quot; &quot;Scowling Man,&quot; &quot;Old Man,&quot; &quot;Young Man,&quot; &quot;Ragged Man&quot; and &quot;Man in Overalls,&quot; in the brief exchanges with strangers that mark the Joads' westward progress.    Sensing, perhaps, that these picaresque events needed some tying together, Mr. Galati has interwoven some of Steinbeck's meditations and descriptions into a kind of running narration spoken by Tom Irwin and Cheryl Lynn Bruce. It's sad that these turn out to be the liveliest moments in this truly lugubrious piece of theater. It's especially distressing to see Messrs. Kinney and Sinise so wan. As two of the original Steppenwolves, they helped create the energetic style for which the company is best known. And they have given some vibrant performances in previous Steppenwolf productions.    Here, they are simply swamped. You'd almost think that the impetus for this piece was the urge to mount something epic rather than to say something epic. In sticking so closely to Steinbeck, Steppenwolf has transformed the book's passion into doggedness, its mythic style into vapid blandness. No one walking out of this production of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; will be inspired to scribble radical exhortations on a wall, or to give a second thought to the migrants who stooped over the lettuce fields picking their evening salad. So, despite its slavish fidelity to the book, this play is in fact the ultimate betrayal of Steinbeck. </TEXT></DOC>
