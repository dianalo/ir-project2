The purpose of the software is to graphicallydisplay and interactively manipulate the events, fit tracks and verticesand calculate physics quantities. The INGRES database forms the coreof the system, while the DI3000 graphics package is used to plot theevents. The paper introduces relational database concepts and their applicabilityto high energy physics data. It also evaluates the environment providedby INGRES, particularly its usefulness in code development and its Fortraninterface. Specifics of the database design they have chosen are detailedas well. 6 references, 2 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
