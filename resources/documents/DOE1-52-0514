Silks treated with a simulated acid rain of pH 3.6 or 2.6 developednecrotic lesions in the most distal regions. When silk tissue was immersedin a simulated acid rain of pH 3.6, the development of necrosis in thetip region was related to the duration of the exposure. Silk tissue placedin a simulated acid rain solution was able to buffer the acidity of therain over time.</TEXT></DOC>
