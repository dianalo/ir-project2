A statement issued by the state-owned airline after a regular board meeting said that &quot;it is in the interest of Air France to be among the launch carriers&quot; for the A-340, which is expected to come into service in the mid-1990s.    Last month, an Air France official said the airline was &quot;considering&quot; an order of six or seven A-340s. The West German carrier Lufthansa is the only airline that has agreed to buy A-340s from Airbus, which is a European consortium. Lufthansa has signed firm orders for 15 jets and has taken options on another 15. </TEXT></DOC>
