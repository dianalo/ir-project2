As previously reported, Dallas-based Southland said it will sell its 465 Chief Auto Parts stores and other businesses to finance a $4 billion leveraged buy-out of Southland. The sales would leave Southland's founding Thompson family, which is leading the buy-out, with the company's 7-Eleven convenience stores, distribution centers and its half interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp. Sources said the auto parts operation could fetch about $120 million.    For the Hafts, who control Dart Group Corp. and have made unsolicited bids for other retailers in recent years, the anticipated offer would mark an unusually friendly step. &quot;This is going to be for sale,&quot; said Robert Haft, who is president of both Landover, Md.-based Dart and Trak Auto Corp., in which Dart has a majority interest. &quot;We're an interested buyer. They've welcomed our participation.&quot;    In Dallas, a Southland spokesman said the company has received &quot;dozens and dozens and dozens of inquiries&quot; about the Chief Auto Parts stores and other divisions it plans to sell. The company, which purchased the Chief chain in 1978 when it had 119 stores, is putting together sales documents on the units and hasn't begun soliciting bids, the spokesman said.    The spokesman declined comment on whether Southland has heard from the Haft family.    In the past, the Hafts have made unsolicited bids for or bought stakes in several companies without taking them over. As a result, the family has a reputation of being more interested in making money on takeover speculation than in actually buying a company. The Hafts have indeed reaped handsome profits on their investments in takeover situations, but they have maintained that they are interested in buying a major retailer or real estate concern.    Most recently, the family sought regulatory clearance to buy a controlling stake in Dayton Hudson Corp. after being rebuffed by the Minneapolis-based retailer. Mr. Haft declined to comment about the family's intentions with respect to Dayton Hudson, but sources familiar with the Hafts have said the family is still serious about wanting to acquire and operate Dayton Hudson.    Mr. Haft said Trak is interested in buying Chief Auto Parts as a way to rapidly expand its operations. Trak currently operates 225 stores in California, the Chicago area, Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va., and has announced expansion plans of its own. In the fiscal year ended March 31, the company earned $1.3 million on sales of $183.7 million.    Chief Auto Parts, with stores primarily in Texas and California, had losses in the early 1980s and is now profitable. &quot;We think we could add some of our systems and our marketing ideas and make it healthy,&quot; Mr. Haft said. &quot;It's in markets we're already in.&quot;    Mr. Haft said Trak approached Southland about buying Chief Auto Parts before Southland announced its leveraged buy-out in early July, but those talks were eclipsed by the buy-out plan.    ---   Karen Blumenthal contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
