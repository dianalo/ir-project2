Just a year ago, 23-year-old Yuri Leonov and a few otheryoung people helped start a little independent newspapercalled the Independent Newspaper. True to its name, itprinted articles that ran contrary to the Communist Party orgovernment line.</LP><TEXT>   Headlines from a June edition: &quot;Americans Show Moscow theWay to the Market,&quot; &quot;Will the KGB Remain in Power?&quot; and --prophetically -- &quot;USSR Facing Instability.&quot; Its circulationsoon grew to 150,000.   On Monday morning, just after the coup, Vitaly Tretiakov,the 37-year-old editor in chief, was told along with theeditors of hundreds of other independent newspapers to stoppublishing. The alternative: fines and possibly jail.   The response of Mr. Tretiakov, Mr. Leonov and their 200Independent Newspaper colleagues: They kept working, day andnight, in their cramped news room, where people bang oldmanual typewriters or write longhand and where a strangeplastic-like contact paper covers the floor. &quot;There was noother answer,&quot; Igor Baranov, the director of the newspaper,says simply. If the coup had succeeded, he says, &quot;it would bethe end for us and for the democracy of the country.&quot;   The staffers of the Independent Newspaper are among themany heroes who risked jail and even death to show thehard-line Communists that it was too late to turn back theclock. The staff of the Independent Newspaper typed up atwo-page edition and used a Xerox machine to produce 1,000copies. They faxed copies to other newspapers and toembassies around the world. With the help of volunteers, theyposted copies in subways. And they stood on corners and gavethem away.   &quot;Most people understood that we could use civil resistanceto stop the coup,&quot; says Mr. Leonov, the young reporter. &quot;Ourstrength was in the newspaper that we gave to the people.&quot;   Those are remarkable words in a nation with a very briefhistory of freedom of the press. Mr. Baranov, the director ofthe three-day-a-week Independent Newspaper, used to be thedirector of a state chemical company that made plastics. Mr.Leonov had just received a degree from the Moscow Institutefor International Relations when he was hired by Mr.Tretiakov as one of the first three reporters at thenewspaper. Mr. Tretiakov told him he was young andinexperienced enough &quot;not to have been influenced by the badSoviet press.&quot;   Fearing reprisals, the journalists didn't put the name ofthe newspaper on the first edition published during thecrisis, which condemned the coup, explained what hadhappened, described tank movements and reported reaction fromaround the country. The jeans-clad Mr. Leonov himself walkedonto the sidewalk to distribute it -- and was quicklysurrounded by a crowd of people who grabbed copies. Even ataxi driver, a usually grouchy bunch who argue over fares anddrive off in a huff if they aren't offered enough, turnedfriendly when he discovered that Mr. Leonov was a journalistwho needed to get to a press conference quickly. &quot;He said,`Please sit down,' and didn't even ask me how much I wouldpay,&quot; Mr. Leonov recalls. &quot;It was amazing.&quot;   Mr. Leonov says the newspaper's efforts were cheered on byother newspapers around the world. Liberation of Paris, forinstance, faxed the staffers a note Monday telling them tokeep up the good work.   By the second day, feeling braver, the newspaper used itsbanner at the top of the page. Then, 10 banned newspapers putout a separate edition with everyone's banner listed in theleft column.   Mr. Leonov didn't eat or sleep on Monday or Tuesday. Hiswife took care of their two-year-old daughter at home.   Wednesday morning, when Mr. Leonov finally went home tocatch some sleep, he was awakened by gunfire that left atleast three people dead. He desperately wanted to find outwhat was happening -- but didn't leave his apartment becauseof the nighttime curfew.   Still, Mr. Leonov was convinced the coup was going tofail. Nobody from the KGB ever visited the newspaper. Thejunta had failed to take the most obvious repressive measure:cutting the telephone lines. Another tell-tale sign came atthe press conference held by new self-appointed leaders. Whenone of them, acting President Gennady Yanayev, said thatMikhail Gorbachev was sick, reporters laughed at him. Anothersign, Mr. Leonov says: Mr. Yanayev looked scared.   Mr. Leonov also says he knew in his heart that most peopleweren't going to support a return to the past. &quot;I knew theSoviet people would feel the sense of freedom that they haveseen for the past six years,&quot; he says. &quot;They couldn't give upand return to the past.   &quot;It is impossible, when people know what a better life is,to give up.&quot;   His colleague, Vladimir K. Abarinov, 36, editor of thenewspaper's foreign department, agrees. He says one reason heknew the coup would fail was because the junta had &quot;gone theold way of saying Gorbachev was sick.   &quot;The times have changed,&quot; he says. &quot;We are past all thatkind of thing now.&quot;   At 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, just about the time that BorisYeltsin was formally announcing that the coup was finished,three columns of tanks and armored personnel carriers simplyevaporated from the center of Moscow. Their pullout seemed tobe accomplished in less than five minutes.   On most days, people in Moscow walk the streets with theirheads down, barely acknowledging each other. But as the newsspread that the coup was over and the junta was on anairplane, the sun suddenly burst through the clouds. Andpeople actually cheered. &quot;I'm happy. The sooner they get backto a normal, legal government, the better,&quot; says NikholaiGerasimov, 23. Mr. Gerasimov, who guards the U.S. Embassy,works for the KGB.   Meantime, at the offices of the Independent Newspaper, Mr.Tretiakov, the editor in chief, sat down at his simple woodendesk and, with a ball point pen, wrote the lead story fortoday's edition. &quot;The tanks leave Moscow with Russian flagson them,&quot; he began. &quot;The coup was unsuccessful. It just fellapart. Democracy and the people have won.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
