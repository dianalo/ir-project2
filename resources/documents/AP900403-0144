Foley said Tuesdaythat if the Supreme Court throws out the federal law against flagburning, he will vote against a constitutional amendment to protectthe flag.   By tradition, the Speaker of the House rarely votes and Foleyhas not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago. But Foleysaid he would come off the speaker's podium and vote ``no'' if theHouse considered a constitutional amendment.   Foley last year supported passage of the law against flagburning. But he said amending the Constitution, and especially theFirst Amendment definition of ``elemental freedoms of thiscountry,'' was not justified.   The First Amendment ``is the most sacred part of theconstitutional document, and to amend it for these reasons would beextraordinarily unwise,'' Foley said. ``I think the judgment ofhistory would be unkind on the Congress or the state legislaturesif that were to occur.''   The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for May 14 onwhether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that theflag burning statute passed by Congress last year isunconstitutional.   Foley has promised a House vote on a constitutional amendmentwithin 30 days if the court rules against the statute.</TEXT></DOC>
