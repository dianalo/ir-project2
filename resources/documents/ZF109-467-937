The answer lies in today's high-performance PCarchitecture.andP;  With the advent of MCA, EISA, and the 486, SCSI is aninterface whoseandM;THIS THING CALLED SCSIandM;SCSI is used in a variety of applications from disk drives and tape backupsystems to printers, CD-ROMS, and even more eclectic I/O devices.andP;  Theprimary concept--and main benefit--of SCSI is that it enables many differentperipherals to share a common I/O bus.andP;  The idea can be traced back to the1960s when IBM's 360 mainframe machine had an I/O bus that could talk toseveral different peripheral devices simultaneously.andM;Over the years, this IBM bus, which became known as the OEM Channel, wasmodified, enhanced, and presented to the American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI) for adoption as a standard I/O bus for peripheral devices.andO;Because of the proprietary nature of the OEM Channel, the ANSI committeerejected it, citing the need for a commercially standard parallel I/O bus.andM;In the early 1980s, a disk drive manufacturer, Shugart Associates, developedits own parallel I/O interface called SASI for Shugart Associates SystemInterface.andP;  When this specification was finalized, it was released to severaldifferent manufacturers and enjoyed commercial success.andP;  In 1982, SASI waspresented to ANSI as a basis for a standard.andP;  Because of the commercialsuccess and widespread market use of SASI, ANSI formalized and extended theSASI specification and changed the name to SCSI (in part to separate thespecification from any one vendor in particular).andP;  But it wasn't until June23, 1986 that SCSI was formally adopted by ANSI.andP;  In fact, the forward to thestandard (which is not an official part of the draft), states that &quot;manyexisting SASI devices are SCSI compatible.&quot;andM;The main advantages over the original SASI are:andM;*  An electrical option that allows devices to be cabled up to 25 meters fromthe host adapter.andM;*  Synchronous data transfers permitting throughput rates of 3MB to 4MB persecond over the SCSI bus.andM;*  An optional extended command set allowing the use of very large capacitystorage devices.andM;*  Command sets for tape drives, printers, processors, and optical drives.andM;HISTORY LESSON OVER--LET'S GET TO WORKandM;So why now for SCSI? A big advantage that SCSI enjoys over other I/Ointerface strategies (e.g.andP;  ESDI and ST-506) is that up to eight differentSCSI devices can be connected to one SCSI bus.andP;  Years ago when PCs had onlyfloppy disks and the occasional hard disk, this type of interface strategyseemed overkill.andP;  But today, with the advent of multiple hard disks, drivearrays, optical drives, high-speed printers, and the myriad of otherperipheral devices, both tangible and those yet to be developed, an interfacestrategy that doesn't require separate adapters for every device makes moresense.andM;From a configuration standpoint, it's also more advantageous: addingperipherals to the SCSI bus only requires setting the SCSI ID for thatdevice.andP;  For nonSCSI devices, it requires configuring both the interfaceadapter as well as the new peripheral.andP;  What this means is that for thesystem with a floppy drive, a hard disk, a printer, an optical drive, and anetwork connection, only one interface card would be required instead offour, leaving bus slots free for those really strange I/O devices.andM;Another advantage the SCSI bus has over other interfaces is that devices onthe bus are logically rather than physically addressed.andP;  This serves twopurposes.andP;  It eliminates any physical limitations a particular CPU imposes onI/O devices, such as the 1024 cylinder limitation PC BIOS places on fixeddisk drives.andP;  Also, logical addressing eliminates any overhead the host mayhave in managing physical aspects of a device, such as a bad track table.andO;The SCSI controller handles this.andM;INITIATORS AND TARGETS: WHICH WAY DOES THE BUS GO?andM;SCSI-supported devices consist of what are called &quot; initiators &quot; and &quot;targets.andP;  &quot; An initiator is any SCSI device that requests an operation to beperformed by another SCSI device.andP;  A target is any SCSI device that performsan operation requested by an initiator.andP;  An example is the SCSI host adapter(initiator) that resides in the expansion slot of a PC and a SCSI disk drive(target) connected to the other end of the bus.andP;  In this instance, the PCrequests information from the disk, tells the SCSI adapter to go get it, andthe SCSI adapter commands the disk controller to retrieve the data.andP;  It's thedisk controller's responsibility to know where the data is physically locatedbased upon the request from the host adapter.andP;  Once the disk reads the data,the controller sends it back across the SCSI bus to the host adapter, atwhich point the cycle is completeandM;But SCSI goes beyond a single initiator/single target configuration.andP;  TheSCSI bus also allows single initiator/multiple target configurations, whereone SCSI adaptor can connect to multiple devices, such as a hard disk and atape drive.andP;  A third configuration lets you have a multipleinitiator/multiple target system, which not only permits multiple peripheraldevices to share the bus, but also allows multiple hosts to share those sameperipheral devices.andM;Another little known fact of the SCSI bus is the concept of extendedmessages.andP;  Typically, each target on the SCSI bus is tied to a physicaldevice.andP;  It is possible, however, to have multiple physical devices hooked toone target.andP;  Through a system of extended messages, you could conceivablyhave 2,048 peripheral devices hooked to a single target--in a singleinitiator/multiple target system, you could have a total of 14,336 peripheraldevices hooked to one SCSI adapter! In theory, this gives the SCSI bus almostunlimited expansion potential.andP;  In practice, though, most vendors wind upwith just one peripheral device per target.andM;MAKING CONNECTIONSandM;While there is potential for many peripheral devices to share one SCSIadapter, only two SCSI devices can communicate over the bus at the same time.andO;How does the bus accommodate the potential traffic that multiple targets cangenerate? The answer lies in another little known SCSI capability calledDisconnect/Reconnect.andM;Because of the logical addressing of the SCSI bus, devices connected to itdon't need the constant supervision required by devices connected to a busthat performs physical addressing.andP;  This fact, along with the idea that notall peripheral devices require constant monitoring by the host (such as whena printer is composing an image in its printer memory) frees up trafficacross the SCSI bus.andP;  In these cases, a peripheral target can Disconnect fromthe initiator while it is going about its business.andP;  This frees the bus sothat other attached devices can communicate.andP;  When the time comes for thetarget (printer) to communicate with the initiator (host) to resume itsfunctioning (such as getting more data to the image) the target Reconnectswith the initiator and resumes where it left off.andM;In multiple-target SCSI configurations using Disconnect/Reconnect, you canhave multiple peripherals competing to use the bus simultaneously.andP;  This isanalogous to how bus mastering cards in both MCA and EISA systems compete forthe system bus.andP;  But the winner of the competition for the SCSI bus isdecided neither by the user configuration set up in MCA systems nor theround-robin approach taken by EISA systems.andP;  Arbitration on the SCSI bus isdecided by a target's SCSI ID number.andP;  The lower the ID number, the higherthe priority the device has on the bus.andP;  When two devices compete for thebus, the one with the lower number always wins.andP;  This is important whenassigning SCSI IDs to a device.andP;  For example, a printer should not be given alower ID number than a hard disk, since it's more critical for CPU operation.andM;IT'S ALL IN THE COMMANDSandM;All these features give the SCSI bus tremendous power and flexibility; but alogically addressed bus needs a way to deal with all the devices that couldbe attached to it in a consistent and non-vendor specific manner.andP;  To dothis, a common command set was created for different types of devicescompatible with the SCSI bus.andP;  This command set is generic in terms of whatit asks devices to do (e.g.andP;  read, write, and print).andP;  It is the peripheralvendor's responsibility to implement these commands in their devices and tointerpret them.andP;  As the SCSI specification states, this command set &quot;aids inthe transfer of logical blocks of data across the bus.andP;  &quot; This command sethas become the key to the future success or failure of the SCSI bus.andM;The true  intelligence&quot; of the SCSI bus is found in a command method calledcommand queuing.andP;  Without command queuing, an initiator can only give atarget one assignment at a time.andP;  With command queuing, a target can acceptmultiple commands from one or multiple initiators and then act on thosecommands.andP;  Command queuing is useful in multiuser and multitaskingenvironments such as Unix and OS/2.andP;  For example, in a multiuser environment,six users may need to read data off the disk simultaneously.andP;  Without commandqueuing, each request must be processed in the order received, regardless ofwhere the data is located on the disk.andP;  This may require the disk heads tojump back and forth across the entire disk surface, wasting time and puttingextra wear on the disk mechanism.andP;  With command queuing, these requests canbe lumped together so that the data closest to the disk heads are read firstfollowed by the data increasingly farther away.andP;  This concept, known as&quot;elevator seeking&quot; can dramatically increase the performance of a SCSI disksystem.andM;THE BUS BREAKS DOWNandM;With everything that SCSI has going for it, why isn't it the dominant I/Ointerface on the PC today? The answer is also in the SCSI specification forthe command set, which led to a proliferation of many different &quot;SCSIS&quot; anddefeated the purpose of the SCSI bus as a standard interface.andM;Within the ANSI standard document X3.131-1986 are listings of commands forvarious I/O device types.andP;  The devices listed in this document are:andM;*  Direct-Access Devices (such as hard disks and floppy disks)andM;*  Sequential-Access Devices (such as tape drives, both streaming andstart-stop)andM;*  Printer DevicesandM;*  Processor DevicesandM;*  Write-Once Read-Multiple (WORM) DevicesandM;*  Read-Only Direct-Access  (CD-ROM) Devices.andM;Each device type has 64 possible operation codes available to it.andP;  Thesecodes are classified as being mandatory  required for devices that supportdevice-independent self-configuring software), optional, vendor-specific, orreserved.andP;  Of the operation codes listed for direct-access devices, forexample, only four of the 64 operation codes are deemed as being mandatoryfor the device to adhere to the SCSI specification.andP;  Four codes are for thedevice independent, self-configuring type.andP;  Twenty-two codes are optional.andO;Twenty-three codes are vendor-specific and 11 codes are reserved.andM;This means that for a hard disk to be considered a &quot; SCSI &quot; hard disk, all ithas to do is implement four commands (Request Sense, Format, Read, andWrite).andP;  Anything beyond these four commands that a vendor might deemnecessary to aid the unit's performance could be implemented and the devicecould still qualify as SCSI compatible.andP;  Often, these &quot;extensions &quot; require anonstandard host adapter or initiator to be properly supported, therebymaking it nonstandard.andM;In retrospect, there are a number of reasons why SCSI didn't take off as anI/O bus.andP;  Certainly, the problem of command set implementation leading to themany different flavors of SCSI didn't help.andP;  It only served to confuse andscare off buyers by making them think they were locking themselves into oneparticular vendor's SCSI.andP;  The relaxed implementation 6f the command set wasa concession to all vendors who had their own particular &quot;SCSI&quot; at the time.andM;Another problem was the PC itself The ST-506 interface was perfectly suitedto the hard and floppy disk storage requirements of the average PC user.andO;Printers were easily attached to parallel and serial ports.andP;  If the userneeded any additional devices, he could add interface cards to get them upand running.andP;  In terms of the number of devices that SCSI could access, itscapabilities were simply beyond what most PC users would ever need.andM;So why didn't SCSI die? The answer is also found inside today's PC.andP;  Whereonce the capabilities of the SCSI bus exceeded the demands that a PC placedon it, the current crop of high-performance 386 and 486 PCs can not only makeuse of, but demand SCSI bus capabilities.andP;  With high performance CPUs comingin small footprint packages, expansion bus slots come at a premium.andP;  A oneslot solution makes a lot of sense in these diminutive power-houses.andP;  Thetrend toward more &quot;intelligent&quot; peripheral devices points toward SCSI aswell, which offloads many I/O tasks from the processor and permits more CPUtime for processor-intensive software such as Unix and OS/2.andM;SCSI II-THE NEXT GENERATIONandM;Given the troubles of the original SCSI specification and the challenges oftomorrow's computer systems, the next logical step, taken on March 9 of thisyear, was to advance the current SCSI to a higher level and callit--surprise!--SCSI II.andM;SCSI II brings many new dimensions to the SCSI specification and somefeatures to advance it to a true common I/O bus.andP;  The SCSI II specificationsupports all the devices that SCSI I supports with the additions of scanningdevices, optical memory devices (such as magneto-optical disk drives), mediumchanger devices (like CD-ROM jukeboxes), and communication devices (networkinterfaces).andM;SCSI II also widens the bandwidth along the I/O bus.andP;  While SCSI I has an8-bit wide bandwidth, SCSI II provides for a 16- or 32-bit wide bus.andP;  (Somepeople refer to this as &quot;Wide SCSI.andP;  &quot;) The SCSI bus' timing has also beenoptimized in SCSI II (sometimes referred to as &quot;Fast SCSI&quot;).andP;  When &quot;WideSCSI&quot; and &quot;Fast SCSI&quot; are combined, throughput rates of 40MB per second arepossible--fast enough to keep the world's MCA and EISA buses filled withdata.andM;Most important, SCSI II imposes a more robust command set.andP;  For example, withdirect access devices, SCSI I deemed that implementation of four commandsmade a device &quot;SCSI&quot;; SCSI II requires 12 commands for these same devices.andM;These improvements help the SCSI bus keep pace with the new generation ofadvanced PC architecture.andP;  However, these improvements alone won't be enoughto make SCSI the standard I/O interface for the nineties.andP;  SCSI still needsmore software support and a way to make the disk system more PC specific-bothare problems that the industry is addressing.andM;Currently, a specification is in the works to allow SCSI controllers toemulate an AT hard disk controller.andP;  Called the AT Bus Attachment (ATA) forISA bus computers and Enhanced AT Bus Attachment (EATA) for EISA buscomputers, this specification will help in overcoming the differences betweenthe physical addressing that a PC performs with a hard disk and the logicaladdressing done on the SCSI bus.andP;  Without ATA, the physical addressesgenerated by a PC to access the hard disk must be translated to logicaladdresses before they can be transmitted across the SCSI bus to the diskdrive where they are again translated back to physical addresses using sometype of device driver.andP;  These translations take time and diminish SCSI'seffectiveness.andM;On the software side, Microsoft Corp. announced at the time of this writing,a layered OS/2 device driver architecture (LADDR) which would provide astandard method for hardware vendors to write SCSI device drivers.andP;  Already,the ANSI committee responsible for SCSI II supports LADDR as do major SCSIhardware vendors such as Adaptec, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, NCR, and WesternDigital.andP;  With this level of support, you can look for lots of future SCSIdevelopments.andM;SCST is an I/O bus whose time has indeed finally come.andP;  The technical meritsof SCSI are clear: they offer today's high-performance PC architectures thestorage and throughput capabilities that these systems demand.andP;  The questionthat remains is whether enough vendors will make their devices &quot;true SCSI&quot; sothat all the benefits of the SCSI bus can be realized.andP;  And with the supportof both IBM and Microsoft, SCSI might turn out to be the dominant I/O bus ofthe decade.andP;  Robert W.
