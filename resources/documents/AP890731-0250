Will Rogers said the tax system generates more liars than thegame of golf, and Edmund Burke said man can be no more successfulabout taxes than love. It goes that way all the way back to theGreeks and Romans.   More currently, when the politics of taxation arise some of themost extreme claims ever made are heard from taxpayers whootherwise stick to the facts.   Everyone has heard them: The rich live off the taxes of thepoor, the rich pay no taxes, the middle class pays most of thetaxes, the poor are taxed disproportionately high.   Seeking facts rather than assumptions, the nonpartisan TaxFoundation went back through Treasury Department and InternalRevenue Service records and came to this conclusion:``The topearning half of the population continues to pay well over 90percent of the Federal individual income tax bill.''   In spite of numerous changes in the law, the percentage has heldfor at least a decade.   The foundation found that in 1987, 43 percent of all federalincome taxes were paid by the highest 5 percent of taxpayers, asignificant increase from the 37.6 percent in 1979. More than halfthe taxes were paid by the top 10 percent, and almost 77 percent bythe highest 25 percent, based on adjusted gross income.   In contrast, the lowest 50 percent paid less than 6 percent oftaxes in 1987.   The system, it concludes, remains progressive. In fact,statistics show it might have grown more even more so, because thelowest half of the income scale paid more than 7 percent of taxesin 1979 and less than that in 1987.   That takes care of the rich and poor _ but what about themiddle-income class? It is in this area that the statistics can doan injustice, and every person who considers himself or herself tobe middle class will tell you so.   The main reason for confusion here is the simple phrase ``ormore.'' It means that those in the top 5 percent of income are inan open-ended category that ranges all the way from $71,125 toscores of millions of dollars.   Drop down to the next lower category and the point becomesclearer. Those earning $54,700 or more paid 55.4 percent of alltaxes paid in 1987. But, an income of $54,700, the foundationpoints out, is hardly ``fat cat'' status.   It comments, ``It still takes millions of basically middle andupper-middle income taxpayers to pay the bulk of the total incometax bill.''   But hold on. Such categories, neat and specific though they be,are really a cause of confusion. Those making $34,260 a year mightbe middle-class statistically, but many of them consider themselvespoor in regard to others.   The term is subjective. A recent college graduate, still single,might think $34,260 a year is excellent compensation. A middle-ageparent funding college tuitions might think it a starvation wage.   For tax purposes, almost all people are poor, not statistically,perhaps, but certainly in their own minds.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, Aug. 1</NOTE></DOC>
