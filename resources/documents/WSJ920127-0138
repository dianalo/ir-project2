Japan's economy continues to grow at a brisker pace thanthat of any other industrialized nation, but Tokyo shareprices are tanking, and financial authorities here wonder ifsome sort of official intervention would prevent investors'deeply rooted pessimism from becoming a self-fulfillingprophecy.</LP><TEXT>   In the U.S., meanwhile, the economy remains braked by alingering recession, the White House is begging Tokyo to buymore American goods, and the dollar is edging toward anall-time low against the yen. But those problems haven'tfazed optimistic investors on Wall Street, where the bettingfavors a recovery: Share prices on the New York StockExchange keep hitting a record high.   What's going on? No one seems certain, but there's growingconcern in Tokyo, at least, that there's little reason tothink Japanese market conditions will brighten.   &quot;I'm getting worried&quot; about the Tokyo market, says PeterTasker, a director at the Tokyo office of Kleinwort BensonInternational Inc. &quot;Unless {Japan's financial} authoritiesreally decide to support the market, it will be a bad year.&quot;   But avoiding that outcome may require Japan's regulatorsto take bold -- and controversial -- action.   Despite recent efforts by the nation's government andsecurities industry officials to talk up the market, theNikkei 225 index resumed its slide into the danger zoneFriday, falling 508.57 points, to 21072.15.   On Monday, the Nikkei index eased 54.31 points to closethe morning session at 21017.84.   Friday's volume was a disappointing 180 million shares.Even with a 675-point rally Wednesday, the Nikkei lost atotal of 249.22 points last week.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all issueslisted in the First Section was down 25.92 points, or 1.61%,to close at 1584.86.   It wasn't supposed to work like that. Last week, bothFinance Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bank of Japan GovernorYasushi Mieno repeatedly made statements in support of themarket. In the past, hopes of official intervention didwonders to stock values.   Nor did the market get a boost from the first publiclyannounced meeting of senior officials of the so-called &quot;BigFour&quot; securities firms -- Daiwa Securities Co., NikkoSecurities Co., Nomura Securities Co., and YamaichiSecurities Co. -- since last summer's financial scandals.   Like the talk from Messrs. Hata and Mieno, the meeting wasclearly designed to draw investors (indeed, many brokersthink the Big Four met at government urging). It was followedwith an apparently false newspaper report that the four wouldcreate a joint fund to buy stocks -- the kind of story that,back when investors had confidence, made prices roar.   Regulators may have to do more than jawbone to keep theNikkei from sinking deeper. The problem is, there doesn'tseem to be much policy makers can do, and many argue that thebest course is simply to wait. If changes do come, look foreasier interest rates or liberalized pension fundregulations.   The mood is certainly serious enough for action. For alllast week's talk, &quot;the psychology {of the market} hasn'tshown any improvement,&quot; said Masanobu Takahashi, researchdirector at Sanyo Investment Research Ltd. &quot;The number ofpeople who believe the Nikkei will go below 20000 isincreasing.&quot; Such a plunge would take the index well underthe 20221.86 low it reached after the 1987 crash.   This is a scary prospect for Japan's financial system. Ifshare prices move down a little bit from here, many Japanesebanks won't meet the capital-adequecy ratios set by the Bankfor International Settlements. A stronger yen would helptheir balance sheets somewhat, but if banks need money, manynow-shaky businesses, particularly in the real estate sector,will collapse.   &quot;The more the market goes down, the less the Japaneseeconomy looks likely to recover&quot; from its current slowdown,said Kleinwort Benson's Mr. Tasker. &quot;That gives companiesfinancing trouble, which can send the market lower. It canbecome self-feeding.&quot;   That prospect lent urgency to Friday's news that seniorofficials of the Bank of Japan will have a meeting in lateFebruary with members of the New York Federal Reserve.   Sources at the Fed played down the meeting, which aspokesman called &quot;not particularly unprecedented.&quot;   Officials are worried about a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; inwhich the anemic U.S. economy prompts investors finally tostart unloading shares, triggering simultaneous financialcrises in Japan and the U.S., says Soichi Enkyo, chiefeconomist at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.   Not everyone here sees a meltdown coming. Several Ministryof Finance officials maintain that bearishness will easewithin the next several weeks, as corporations stop sellingstocks in their corporate funds ahead of the March 31 end ofthe fiscal year.   They also think the outlook for business will pick upsoon, as the Bank of Japan's Dec. 30 cut in the officialdiscount rate to 4.5%, the third in six months, takes effecton investment plans.   Given what they see as the prospect of a turnaroundrelatively soon, the bureaucrats are reluctant to instituteextraordinary measures.   The government's willingness to act apparently increaseswhen stocks are under the 21000 level, however. During thecrash of 1990, it was the point where then-Finance MinisterRyutaro Hashimoto announced market-boosting measures.   On Wednesday, when the Nikkei opened at 20858.30, the Bankof Japan injected funds into the money market, which sentshort-term interest rates below 5%. The central bank, whichremains concerned about inflation, tightened on Thursday andFriday, though, sending rates back over 5.5%.   Friday's stock market tumble should cause them to rethinktheir policy on short rates. Another cut in the discount rateis still likely to be at least a month off, as the bankersgauge business sentiment.   There are other steps the government could take, too. Mostprobable is to raise the maximum amount pension funds caninvest in the market.   Yet there are signs that the authorities may be right tosimply wait for a market turnaround. On Friday afternoon theTokyo Exchange revealed that in the week ending Jan. 17,Japanese corporations were net buyers of 11.6 billion yen($93.6 million) of stocks. This was only the second timethey've been net buyers since October 1990.   ---   Other Market Activity                                                                                                          London share prices fell Friday, hurt by worries about theoutlook for corporate profits and Britain's economicrecovery.
