Each applicant's information,which is subject to the verification regulations, is used to calculatean EFC. The EFC is the amount that an applicant and the applicant's familycan reasonably be expected to contribute toward the cost of attendanceat an institution of higher education and is used to determine the applicant'sfinancial need for assistance. The applicant's financial need is definedas the difference between the applicant's cost of attendance and the EFC.The applicant may receive assistance under most Title IV Higher EducationAct programs upon demonstrating financial need for such assistance. The Secretary proposes to amend Section s668.53(a)(3) to reduce burdenplaced on institutions to notify each applicant that completes the verificationprocess of the results of verification. Instead, institutions would berequired to notify verified applicants of the results of verification onlyif the applicant's expected family contribution and award or loan amountchanges as a result of verification. An applicant's award letter may serveas this notification.The Secretary proposes to amend andSection; 668.54(a) to provide that aninstitution is not required to verify the information from more than 30percent of its applicants for assistance under the Pell Grant, campus-based,need-based ICL, and GSL Programs in any award year. This proposed changeis required by section 484(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.Currently, the regulations give an institution the authority to requirean applicant, selected for verification, to provide documentation to verifyany data element it specifies. The Secretary proposes to amend andSection;668.54 and andSection; 668.60 to require an applicant to provide the necessarydocumentation to verify any data element required by an institution orthe Secretary. Previously, citizens of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands wereexcluded from verification requirements, unless an institution had informationconflicting with information reported by an applicant or otherwise hadreason to believe information reported by an applicant to be incorrect.The Compact of Free Association (Pub. L. 99-239) conferred independentnation status on certain entities, formerly trust territories of the UnitedStates; these entities are now known as the Federated States of Micronesiaand the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Therefore, the Secretary proposesto amend andSection; 668.54 to update the references to these entities sothat eligible Title IV aid applicants from these entities continue to beexcluded from verification requirements. In anticipation of the enactmentof a similar compact to create the Republic of Palau, these provisionsare prospectively extended to eligible students of that Republic. Section 668.54(b)(2)(vii) currently provides that under certain conditionsa student transferring from one institution to another may be excludedfrom verifying data at the second school. The Secretary requests commenton how to notify the second school that it is not required to verify thestudent's data. The purpose of this notification is to relieve burden andimprove delivery of aid. The Secretary requests comments on the use ofthe Electronic Student Aid Report (ESAR) to achieve this goal. Section 668.55 is being amended to simplify and clarify the updating requirements.Currently, applicants must update or verify information as to the numberof household members and the number of household members enrolled in postsecondaryinstitutions, except for changes in marital status. Currently, the regulations require an applicant to update information asto dependency status, except for changes in marital status, throughoutthe year. Also, an applicant is not permitted to update dependency statuson a GSL application, if the institution has previously certified thatapplication. To simplify the regulations and to make the updating requirementsmore consistent, the Secretary proposes to eliminate the marital statusexception and require all applicants to update dependency status, includingapplicants for whom a loan has been certified. In the proposed regulations,applicants would be required to update information as to their householdsize, number of family members enrolled in a postsecondary educationalinstitution, and dependency status throughout the year regardless of thereason for a change in the applicant's dependency status, for all TitleIV programs. Household size, number of family members enrolled in a postsecondaryeducational institution, and dependency status, under these proposed regulations,must be updated as a result of an actual change in an applicant's maritalstatus and may not be updated or changed because of a projected changein marital status. Title IV Quality Control Studies indicate that there is significant misreportingby applicants of the number of family members enrolled in postsecondaryeducational institutions. These errors have resulted in incorrect awardsand loans to students. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to amend andSection;668.56 to provide that an institution must require an applicant selectedfor verification to verify the number of family members enrolled in postsecondaryeducational institutions, even though there was no change from informationverified in the previous award year. Section 668.56(a)(5) (formerly andSection; 668.56(a)(6)) would be amendedto delete data elements, listed in the verification regulations, that areno longer considered untaxed income as a result of the Tax Reform Act of1986. Untaxed income is income that is excluded from Federal taxation byprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of Title IV student financial assistance, untaxed incomeis considered in the formula used to determine the EFC toward the costsof postsecondary education. Except for Social Security benefits and childsupport, the Secretary relies on the information applicants, their spouses,and their parents report on their Federal tax returns to verify the receiptof untaxed income that is subject to the verification requirements. TheSecretary intends to maintain untaxed income verification requirementsthat are consistent with Federal income tax reporting requirements foruntaxed income items listed on the Federal tax return, except for SocialSecurity benefits and child support. To avoid publishing new regulations each time Federal income tax reportingrequirements for untaxed income change, the Secretary proposes to followFederal income tax reporting requirements in determining elements of untaxedincome subject to verification. The Secretary, in andSection; 668.56(a)(5)(vii),would require verification of all elements of untaxed income listed onthe tax return without the use of additional schedules or attachments,beginning with the 1990-91 award year. The Secretary would publish in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> a list of categories of untaxed income subjectto verification whenever Internal Revenue Service reporting requirementsfor untaxed income change. Because of recent changes in Federal tax reporting requirements, andSection;668.56(a)(5) would be amended to delete references to unemployment compensation,which is now fully taxable, and to delete references to the married couplededuction and dividend exclusion, which have been discontinued. Similarly,references to capital gains would be deleted since these are now treatedas taxable income and therefore no longer require a separate verificationrequirement. This section would also be amended to require interest ontax-free bonds to be verified as a part of untaxed income. Prior to 1987,taxpayers were not required to report interest on tax-free bonds on the1040 and 1040A tax forms. The new IRS Forms 1040 and 1040A include thesedata as a line item.Section 668.56(c) of the current Verification Regulations provides an exclusionfor the verification of a dependent Pell applicant's base year income because,under the previous Student Aid Index (SAI) formula, estimated year earningswere often used to calculate the applicant's EFC, instead of base yearadjusted gross income. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, nowrequires the use of the dependent Pell applicant's base year income asa fixed data element in the current SAI formula used in calculating anapplicant's EFC, unless the dependent student is classified as a dislocatedworker by the appropriate State agency in accordance with Title III ofthe Job Training Partnership Act. Consequently, the Secretary is proposingto delete andSection; 668.56(c) to, in effect, require verification of dependentstudent base year income. This change does not result in significant additionalburden to financial aid administrators because dependent student base yearincome must already be verified beginning with the 1988-89 award year forthe campus-based and Guaranteed Student Loan programs. Public Law 100-369 requires income tax returns filed with the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico, the government of another U.S. territory or commonwealth,or the central government of a foreign country to be treated the same asU.S. income tax returns. Therefore, andSection; 668.57 would be amended toconsider an income tax return filed with a government of a U.S. territoryor commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a foreign governmentin the same manner as a U.S. income tax return. Section 668.57(d), independent student status, would be deleted. The HigherEducation Act requires that, for independent students within certain categories,no disbursal of an award may be made without documentation of independentstudent status. The Secretary has previously issued guidance on this subjectin a ``Dear Colleague Letter'' and will not prescribe requirements to documentindependent student status in these regulations. Section 668.59 is being amended to change the amount of the dollar toleranceoption for the GSL and campus-based programs and also to delete one ofthe Pell Grant specific tolerance options: SAI Recalculation Option. Atolerance option is a dollar error level allowed on an applicant's applicationfor which the recalculation of an applicant's EFC or SAI will not be required.A $200 tolerance option would be proposed for all Title IV programs inplace of the current $200 Pell and $800 GSL/campus-based programs toleranceoptions. It is appropriate to apply the tolerance previously used onlyfor the Pell Grant Program to the campus-based, need-based ICL, and GSLprograms because the Higher Education Act now provides a single formulafor establishing need for campus-based and need-based ICL aid and GuaranteedStudent Loans, similar to the formula for the Pell Grant Program. Previously,under the Uniform Methodology, allowable variances in calculating the EFCwarranted a more liberal tolerance. Additionally, the use of a single toleranceamount will increase consistency among the Title IV programs. Therefore,the Secretary proposes to use the Pell Grant $200 tolerance figure to makeall Title IV programs consistent. Because changes in the Pell Grant formula made the Zero SAI Charts toocomplex, reference to the Zero SAI Charts would be deleted. An institutionmay continue to process the application of any applicant with a reportedSAI of zero on his or her SAR without submitting that SAR to the Secretaryfor recalculation, if the institution determines that the applicant's SAIremains at zero on the basis of the verified information. Section 668.58 is being amended to specify that a CWS recipient may beemployed for the first sixty (60) consecutive days of the award year, priorto verification being completed, provided the institution has no informationindicating that the aid application is inaccurate. Several other minor changes have been made to the verification regulationsto reflect changes in verification requirements resulting from the HigherEducation Amendments of 1986. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291  </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Small entities affected by these regulations are small institutions ofhigher education. The proposed regulations revise the verification itemsused to calculate an applicant's financial need. These changes are requiredby statutory amendments. There are several other minor changes in the regulationsto update present policy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Sections 668.53, 668.54, 668.55, 668.56, 668.57, and 668.59 contain informationcollection requirements.
