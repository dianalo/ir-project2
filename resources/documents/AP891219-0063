The announcement followed a meeting between Modrow and WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during which the two leadersdiscussed the thorny issue of how to bring the long-divided nationscloser together.   Since the Berlin Wall started crumbling early last month,Germans in both East and West have demanded an opening at the gateto demonstrate the new era of improved relations between thecountries.   Modrow told reporters the new opening for pedestrians will becreated before Monday. And the date for visa-free travel by WestGermans and West Berliners to East Germany will be moved up fromJan. 1 to Dec. 24, in time for Christmas and New Year.   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe today:   _Former Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel received anendorsement for president from the Communist premier, Marian Calfa.   _Hungarian radio reported that gunfire rang out early today inthe streets of the Romanian city of Timisoara, where bloody clashesbetween security forces and anti-government protesters reportedlyleft dozens dead last weekend.   _Yugoslavia's premier suffered a blow after the nation's largestrepublic, Serbia, flatly rejected his key reform program that wouldintroduce market mechanisms into the ailing economy.   The summit highlighted the debate raging over Germanreunification, which Kohl supports and Modrow opposes.   Chants of ``Helmut! Helmut!'' and ``Germany, unitedfatherland!'' rose from the crowd of at least 5,000 that lined thestreets as Kohl's motorcade of black Mercedes limousines carriedhim to the meeting at the Hotel Bellevue.   Workers in hard hats left work to catch a glimpse of thechancellor, and West German flags and banners calling for Germanunity formed a sea of red, black and gold.   But there were signs of opposition to Kohl's pro-reunificationstance.   ``A Fourth Reich _ Is that why you stayed behind?'' said oneposter on a fence in the city center. It referred to those EastGermans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy West Germany,choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild their troubledsocialist state.   With the ruins of war-ravaged buildings visible in the distance,Modrow told reporters his first talks with Kohl marked a ``newbeginning'' in relations between the countries. Kohl accepted anoffer to start negotiations on a treaty to improve relations, andnegotiations will start ``immediately,'' Modrow said.   Kohl told reporters he hopes such a treaty can be signed by latespring.   He later walked through a crowd of several thousand people.Several signs called for German reunification, with one saying``Helmut and Hans, make us into one Germany.''   At an outdoor rally, Kohl drew wild cheers when he referred tothe crowd as ``compatriots'' and said, ``We will not abandon you.''   ``The emotions are nice, but we have to see what the realityis,'' he said on West Germany's ZDF television.   Kohl said he and Modrow would meet again at the end of Januaryor the beginning of February.   He said the two sides ``got closer on some issues,'' citing theEast German push for a more formal relationship between the twostates.   The summit was held in Dresden because West Germany refuses toacknowledge East Berlin as the capital of a separate and sovereignEast German state.   East Germany has been seeking a ``Treaty Community,''establishing fuller ties between East and West Germany, rather thanworking to join them.   Kohl has proposed a 10-point plan aimed at eventual Germanreunification.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today reiteratedSoviet concerns about reunification during a speech to members ofthe European Parliament in Belgium, saying there are two goodreasons to oppose it:   ``We (the Soviet Union) paid the price of 20 million lives forthe existing European stability,'' he said of World War II.``Furthermore, can the German people themselves forget the nationaltragedy brought onto them by Hitlerism?''   Kohl has made clear that his conservative-led government seekseventual reunification of the two German states that have beendivided since 1945.   But Modrow and many other East Germans active in theincreasingly fragmented political arena have said joining the twostates would be destabilizing for Europe and would result in a``sellout'' of East German land and industry.   Reunification has become a major topic of public debate and apolitical football in both Germanies ever since a massive popularuprising forced East Germany to open its borders Nov. 9 and led toa crumbling of Communist control.   East Germany's first free elections are now set for May 6.   Chants of ``Germany, united fatherland'' occasionally disrupteda candlelight vigil in Leipzig on Monday night. The silent marchwas called by church and reform leaders in memory of the victims ofStalinism.   The words ``Germany, united fatherland'' were originally part ofthe East German national anthem but have been excised since theearly 1970s when Communist officials dropped reunification as agoal.</TEXT></DOC>
