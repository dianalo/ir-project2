The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced that depositorswithdrew $9.4 billion from Sandamp;Ls in February, down only slightlyfrom the all-time record of $10.6 billion in withdrawals in January.   For just the first two months of this year, withdrawals havetotaled $20 billion, more than double the net withdrawals for allof 1988, which were $8.6 billion.   Analysts attributed the bulk of the withdrawals in both Januaryand February to the failure of Sandamp;Ls to keep pace with risinginterest rates offered by competitors, principally money marketmutual funds.   The latest bad news on declining deposits came as the HouseBanking subcommittee on financial institutions began voting on thefirst of several of the 165 proposed amendments to the Sandamp;Llegislation.   The subcommittee, which includes all but four members of thefull committee, voted 35-12 to adopt an amendment that would leavethe Sandamp;L regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, witheven less authority than proposed by President Bush.   The amendment, offered by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, gives theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., rather than the bank system,primary authority to regulate state-chartered Sandamp;Ls.   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., alsoadopted by voice vote an amendment providing fixed four-year termsto the chairman and vice chairman of the FDIC, which now insuresdeposits in commercial banks and would also become responsible forinsuring Sandamp;L accounts. The Bush administration had proposed makingthe chairman of the FDIC serve at the pleasure of the president.   A third amendment, offered by Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C.,encourages state housing authorities to buy repossessed Sandamp;Lproperties from the federal government.   The subcommittee planned to meet all day today and for two daysnext week.   In a further indication that the legislation may face slowgoing, the full committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,D-Texas, earlier said he doubted the subcommittee has set asideenough time and promised to reconsider any of the amendments ifsponsors believe they received short shrift in the subcommittee.   ``I'm not going to be party to a stampede, to act in great hasteonly to repent later at great leisure,'' he said.   In the Senate, the legislation appears to moving at a fasterpace. The Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,D-Mich., told members of his panel that Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, intends to have the Senate vote on the billduring the week of April 17.   The Senate committee met privately for five and a half hoursTuesday, eight hours Wednesday and plans another session today.   ``It looks like many, most, of the controversial decisions willbe made behind the closed doors of the Senate Banking Committee _no votes, no fingerprints, no political blood,'' said Kenneth A.Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent BankersAssociation of America.   One possible snag in the Senate is Riegle's effort to scrap thepart of the administration plan that would keep $50 billion in Sandamp;Lspending from counting as part of the budget deficit, with manyDemocrats lining up behind Riegle and most Republicans opposed.   Kevin Gottlieb, director of the Senate committee staff, saidpanel members Wednesday did not resolve the question, but he saidDemocrats were ``sending a strong signal'' that Riegle's fundingpackage remained ``clearly viable'' despite administration attemptsto squelch it.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has put together a similaramendment in the House, but on Wednesday he said he was concernedabout reaction in financial markets and had not decided whether tooffer it.   However, Gonzalez today strongly supported including Sandamp;Lspending in the budget, criticizing Bush for going ``the budgetgimmick route _ the most expensive route.''   ``I know that President Bush is stuck with his `read my lips'statements, but this committee's responsibility goes beyondcampaign slogans,'' he said.   In another development Wednesday Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady, in an effort to persuade Congress to accept the mainfeatures of the administration's proposal, warned that he mayrecommend a veto of any rescue package that gives the industry toomuch leeway in getting its financial house in order.   Brady told a small group of reporters that Congress would be``asking for a repeat of the (Sandamp;L) problem some time in thefuture'' if it passed bailout legislation that postponed the 1991deadline set by the administration for Sandamp;Ls to beef up theircapital.</TEXT></DOC>
