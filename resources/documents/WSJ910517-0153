Operating profit climbed 48% to 36 billion pesetasfrom 24.3 billion pesetas.</LP><TEXT>   Repsol's performance &quot;was very good thanks to widerefining and marketing margins,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;With thestart of the {Persian Gulf} war, crude prices dropped, butthere was a lag before the prices of oil products began tofall, which kept margins high.&quot;   Though margins on refining and marketing have beennarrowing steadily since the war's end in late February, thecompany's prospects for the year are still bright, he said,because margins remain &quot;significantly high.&quot;   In addition, Repsol stands to benefit from a steadyincrease in the use of natural gas, a key element of theSpanish government's pending energy plan, he said. To preparefor an expected surge in gas demand, the oil company hasagreed to merge its gas unit, Gas Madrid S.A., with Catalanade Gas S.A.   Repsol owns 14% of Catalana de Gas, and La Caixa, aBarcelona-based savings bank, holds 31%.   Gas Natural, as the new gas company will be known, willalso include gas assets belonging to Repsol Butano, one ofRepsol's four divisions. Repsol Butano will continue tomarket liquid propane gas.   Operating profit from Repsol's liquid propane and naturalgas activities climbed 31% to five billion pesetas in thefirst quarter, bolstered by an 80% increase in natural gassales.   To expand its proven oil reserves, Repsol acquired 50% ofthe Vizcacheras oil field in Argentina in the first quarter,raising its production capacity by 12,000 barrils of oil aday. Total investments in the quarter came to 24 billionpesetas, half of which was channeled into marketing, refiningand logistics.</TEXT></DOC>
