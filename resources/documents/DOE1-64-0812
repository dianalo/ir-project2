First: the best way peace can be guaranteed isby each country ensuring its own defence. It may sound obvious, but itmust be constantly stressed: defence rests on a military balance. Theauthor is quite aware that this concept of balance is extremely complex.But, if he does not know exactly what balance is, he does know what imbalanceis. The second concept is detente, that is to say, normal relations withour Eastern partners and in particular with the Soviet Union, especiallyin the economic sector. France has never been willing to turn economicrelations into a weapon as part of an overall strategy. There are manyreasons for this. In any event, many of us believe that &quot;the economicweapon&quot; is totally impracticable. We must therefore have normal East-Westrelations and we should even try to strengthen them. The third conceptis that we should make an effort to ensure the military balance - difficultthough it may be to determine - at the lowest level possible.</TEXT></DOC>
