Mr. Strauss asked publisher Ted Cross, who describes himself as a &quot;good Democrat,&quot; to soften or kill the article. Mr. Cross says that instead he will publish the piece one month later than planned, along with a rebuttal to be written by the speaker.    &quot;We're not backing down,&quot; Mr. Cross says. &quot;I'm a journalist with integrity.&quot;    The monthly claims circulation of 20,000, including many copies sent free to senior banking executives. In its March edition, it reprinted the first half of the article, which had appeared in full last year in the Washington business magazine, Regardie's, under the title, &quot;The Speaker and the Sleaze.&quot; It was reprinted later by Texas Observer, a liberal journal. After each appearance, Mr. Wright, a Texas Democrat, and his aides denounced it angrily and said several facts were wrong.    When Mr. Strauss, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the monthly, it already had printed the final episode as part of its April issue, but hadn't mailed any copies. At a meeting at the monthly's New York office last Monday, Mr. Strauss and Speaker Wright's chief of staff, Marshall Lynam, confronted the publisher, his attorney, and free-lance writer William Adler, an author of the article.    &quot;I told them they shouldn't run the . . . thing,&quot; Mr. Strauss says. &quot;I told them we might very well sue . . . &quot; Mr. Strauss added: &quot;I did it with a smile. I said I think you've just got inaccurate information.&quot;    The article contains unflattering profiles of Mr. Wright and of Donald Dixon, a Texas savings and loan promoter whose Vernon Savings Association collapsed into insolvency last year with 98% of its loans in default. That required a $1.3 billion rescue, the biggest in the history of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The article also recounts Mr. Wright's feud last year with federal thrift industry regulators on behalf of Texas savings and loans and real-estate developers.    Messrs. Strauss and Lynam met with the publication's officials only days after a former Vernon official pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges and agreed to cooperate with an investigation. Mr. Dixon has refused to testify on grounds of possible self-incrimination.    Mr. Lynam called the article &quot;scurrilous,&quot; and Mr. Strauss said he can provide &quot;absolute evidence of inaccuracies.&quot; But a &quot;fact sheet&quot; that they provided disputes the tone of the article more than its facts. For example, it says, &quot;The writers make the absurd allegation that 'Texans don't give a hoot about questions of ethics and judgment.' . . . Texans, including Jim Wright, have provided some of the great leadership and moral direction for the United States.&quot;    It also insists that Mr. Wright didn't swear at William Black, a senior FSLIC official, as depicted in the article's lead anecdote. A letter to Mr. Strauss from journalist John M. Barry, who was present at the meeting while researching a book, says Mr. Wright did get angry at the deputy's interruptions and said, &quot;Now you wait just a goddamn minute. I listened to you. Now you listen to me.&quot; Mr. Strauss attached the letter to bolster his case.    Mr. Cross, the publisher, says the meeting with Mr. Strauss was &quot;cordial, polite and as you can imagine on his side, courtly and persuasive.&quot; After the meeting, Mr. Cross yanked the article from the April magazine, which required him to discard some pages already printed and to substitute another article. His attorney sent Mr. Strauss a letter saying this entailed &quot;considerable expense,&quot; but was being done &quot;to afford your client an opportunity to have his response to the article published at the same time.&quot;    Mr. Strauss said he hadn't decided whether he would charge Mr. Wright a fee. He said he would have to consider whether House rules permitted him to give free legal help, and whether he was acting as a lawyer or as a &quot;friend and adviser.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
