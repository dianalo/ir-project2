Public Order Minister Dimitris Manikas said the alert was ajoint decision made last week by the European Community's securityofficials, and in reaction to the arrest of suspected Shiite Moslemterrorists in Spain on Nov. 23.   In addition, the U.S. State Department sent an advisory Dec. 15to U.S. embassies expressing its concern that terrorists may beplanning near-term attacks against U.S. interests.   The increased vigilance was ordered at Greece's airports,frontier posts, seaports, embassies and airline offices.   Manikas declined to disclose whether information had beenreceived advising of possible terrorist action in Greece.   He said security at Athens International Airport, a hub forMiddle Eastern points, was already one of the tightest in the world.   Terrorists have struck in Greece several times in the past 10years. In the most recent incident in July 1988, nine people werekilled and 53 injured in a grenade attack aboard a Greek liner asit sailed toward Athens. No one has ever been arrested in thebloody incident but police suspect terrorists of Middle Easternorigin were involved.</TEXT></DOC>
