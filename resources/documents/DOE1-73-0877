Discharged waste gases and liquids, which range in temperaturefrom less than 100{sup 0}F to well over 2000{sup 0}F, should be consideredfuels, just like coal, oil, or natural gas, and must be recovered, whenevereconomically feasible. A variety of devices for capturing previouslydischarged energy easily and effectively for use in process, comfort,and combustion applications are described.</TEXT></DOC>
