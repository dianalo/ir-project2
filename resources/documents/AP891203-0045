The historic action, announced by megaphone to a wildly cheeringcrowd, stripped power from Krenz less than six weeks after hereplaced hard-liner Erich Honecker. Krenz was left off the newpanel, which will control East Germany's ruling party until a partycongress later this month.   It was the shortest reign of any leader in the country'shistory. However, Krenz retains the largely ceremonial position ofpresident.   The Communists also expelled Honecker from the party he had ledfor 18 years and announced that three ousted Politburo members hadbeen arrested on corruption charges. A top state trade officialfled the country.   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans linked hands across thecountry to form a human chain intended to increase pressure forquicker democratic reforms and to protest corruption in CommunistParty ranks.   In neighboring Czechoslovakia, leaders included non-Communistsin the government for the first time in 21 years, but angeredopposition leaders said there were too many Communist holdovers onthe new Cabinet. They vowed to resume pro-democracy protests.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev praised the changes underway in Eastern Europe as he ended his two-day summit with PresidentBush.   ``I think (it) is something we should welcome because it'sconnected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble theirsocieties, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open upthe rest of the world,'' he said.   Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus ofthousands, Krenz took over on Oct. 18 and opened the Berlin Wall onNov. 9. He promised democratic reforms including free elections,but there were increased calls for his ouster even within the partybecause of his past links to Honecker's rule. He was jeeredSaturday by party members who demanded his resignation.   The new committee will run party affairs until a special partycongress Dec. 15-17 and prepare for that congress. Its role ingoverning the country was not immediately clear.   Guenter Schabowski announced the resignations of the 10-manPolitburo and the 163-member, policy-making Central Committee bymegaphone to 10,000 cheering people who stood outside the CentralCommittee building.   ``The Politburo accepts the criticism raised by a large numberof party members that the current leadership is not capable ofuncovering the entire scope of serious mistakes of the members ofthe former Politburo and to draw the necessary consequences,'' hesaid.   Schabowski, who was one of those who resigned from thePolitburo, was considered a reformer, but like all of the oustedofficials, he was not named to the new committee.   Officials made it clear the Central Committee actions were meantto convince the populace the party is truly intent on jettisoningits tainted image and fulfilling demands for political and economicreforms.   ``We want to form a modern Socialist party guided by the rankand file. We want to save this country. We want to savesocialism,'' said Gregor Gysi, a prominent East Berlin lawyer andspokesman for the new 25-member committee.   Gysi said the panel's first act was to set up a commission toexamine ``violations of the party's statutes and laws by former andcurrent functionaries of the party.''   The new panel includes reformers such as former spymaster MarkusWolf, Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and the panel's chairman,Erfurt party chief Herbert Kroker.   Kroker said the leadership was forced to resign because ``of itsinability to develop a constructive policy for the renewal ofsocialism.''   Gysi said Premier Hans Modrow, also a reformer, declined anoffer to join the committee because his current work already takesup most of his time.   Schabowski also announced the ouster from the party of Honeckerand 11 other disgraced officials following disclosures ofcorruption among top party ranks.   Others thrown out of the party included former Premier WilliStoph, ex-security chief Erich Mielke and former Parliament speakerHorst Sindermann.   The 12 are suspected of ``serious violations of partystatutes,'' Schabowski said.   The widening investigations of corruption led to the arrests ofthree former Politburo members.   Guenter Mittag and Harry Tisch, who had been key Politburomembers under Honecker, were arrested and accused of ``heavilydamaging socialist property and the people's economy through abuseof power,'' the state-run news service ADN said.   Gerhard Mueller, former party leader in the city of Erfurt andformer candidate, or non-voting, member of the Politburo, wasarrested under similar suspicions, ADN said.   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a state secretary in the foreigntrade ministry, fled the country after authorities opened aninvestigation into suspected corruption by him, ADN reported.   Mittag was expelled from the party last month, while Tisch,Mueller and Schalck-Golodkowski were kicked out Sunday.   ADN said that 30 other criminal probes into allegations ofcorruption had been opened, but it did not give any names.   Schalck-Golodkowski was East Germany's chief trade negotiatorand headed the Commercial Coordination department, which has beenresponsible for acquiring hard currency.   The investigation was opened after Saturday's discovery of asecret operation to ship weapons to the Middle East, Africa andSouth America.   Hard-currency earnings from the sales went to the country'sforeign trade bank addressed to Schalck-Golodkowski, ADN said,without mentioning how much money was involved.</TEXT></DOC>
