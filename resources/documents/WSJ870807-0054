Currently, only Japanese financial institutions may invest directly in financial futures overseas, obtaining the permission in May. The new rules would include other corporations.    Tsuneo Iida, a professor at Nagoya University, has been nominated to head the panel. The full roster of 20 members should be drawn up by the end of the month, the ministry official said.    The panel is expected to make its recommendations by year's end, and they will be incorporated in a package of proposed revisions of Japan's foreign exchange control law, the official said.    Separately, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange plans to open a marketing office in Tokyo Sept. 1, said Bruce Teague, the exchange's managing director for the Far East region.    On Sept. 17 the exchange begins evening trading in currency options and futures to coincide with morning trading in Japan. While Japanese financial institutions aren't allowed to trade options on cash instruments, some do so through overseas subsidiaries, Mr. Teague said. Many Japanese banks and securities firms also hedge foreign exchange risks with currency futures and futures options traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.    The Philadelphia exchange's Tokyo office would complement an existing marketing office in Hong Kong. Mr. Teague, who is based in Hong Kong, will move to Tokyo to open the new office. </TEXT></DOC>
