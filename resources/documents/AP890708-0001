She said the numbers of dead birds being found has dropped offsince the initial fatalities after the tanker struck a reef inPrince William Sound on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallonsof crude oil spilled into the sea.   In general, seabirds over water cannot detect oil and do notdiscriminate between clean places and dirty places in deciding whereto touch down, Mendenhall said.   Figures released Friday by a federal information office in Valdezshow 563 of 1,326 seabirds received alive at rescue centers havebeen released. Nearly 600 have died at the facilities.   Fish andamp; Wildlife Service spokesman Bruce Batten said 103 baldeagles are known to have died from the spill. Alaska's bald eaglepopulation is about 35,000, with 3,000 of the birds in PrinceWilliam Sound and 5,000 in other areas contaminated with oil, hesaid.   The federal tally sheet released Friday also reported 843 ottersdead. About two-thirds of the 343 received alive by rescue centershave survived. Batten said a Fish andamp; Wildlife Service plan for therelease of treated otters likely will be issued next week.</TEXT></DOC>
