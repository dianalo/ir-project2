That's the brokerage-house employee whocalls you up and asks you to post more money after a tradeyou have made has gone bad. As a rule those phone calls arenot pleasant. But if you read Michael Curley's book&quot;Understanding and Using Margin&quot; (Probus, 158 pages, $19.95),you might be able to avoid receiving such calls. Mr. Curley'sbook is written for stock and bond investors and not forthose who trade commodities or options on futures.Nevertheless, it provides good basic information for anyonewho trades on margin -- that is, someone who borrows aportion of the cost of his or her investment. The book showsreaders what margin can do for an investor if he is rightabout his investments and, alas, the consequences if he iswrong. (It would not be of much use to commodity traderssince futures trading involves no borrowing of funds as itdoes when trading equities and debt instruments on margin.)   ---   The future will be just like the past, only different,says Bruce Babcock Jr. in his book &quot;The Dow Jones-Irwin Guideto Trading Systems&quot; (Dow Jones-Irwin, 316 pages, $57.50).With that warning one might wonder why bother to even try todevise a trading system to extract profits from the commoditymarkets? But Mr. Babcock makes a fairly convincing argumentthat with a little patience, thought and an inexpensivepersonal computer profitable systems can be created.(However, whether you or anyone else will be able to use suchsystems to actually take money from the markets is anotherstory. Developing trading systems and using them profitablyare two separate skills, not necessarily related.)   Mr. Babcock starts with market basics and makes tradingsound easy. But then he explains why about 70% of allcommodity traders lose money and you learn it has nothing todo with the nature of markets and everything to do with thenature of people. Chapter 7 alone is worth the price of thebook as it gives a brief history of the marketing of tradingsystems. If the practices he describes didn't cost people somuch money, it would be hilarious to read about the salespitches that have persuaded traders to shell out thousands ofdollars for questionable systems. (Unfortunately, these samemethods continue in use today.) Readers will learn how todesign and test trading systems.   More importantly they also will learn about the pitfallsof &quot;curve-fitting,&quot; that is, designing a system that tradesthe past perfectly but has about the same chance of producingprofits in the future as I have of becoming a pilot in theChinese air force. Mr. Babcock doesn't just show you how todevelop a successful system but actually provides you withseveral of them that appear, at least on paper, to have thepotential of being profitable in the future. Unfortunately,most investors do not have the discipline to trade any systemfor consistent profits.   ---   But futures are not the only derivative instruments thatmarkets offer to dyed-in-the-wool risk takers. They alsooffer options on futures. Readers who want a straight-forwardintroduction to the subject should read Ronald Frost's book&quot;Options on Futures&quot; (Probus, 254 pages, $55). Mr. Frost haswritten the text as a workbook and provides exercises aftereach section to let readers see if they truly understand themeaning of such terms as delta, theta, gamma and a Christmastree spread.   ---   I'm not the type of guy who leads readers into a casinoand says, &quot;Here's $50, good luck]&quot; and walks out. So here's abook by three attorneys, Stephen Elias, Albin Renauer andRobin Leonard, that could be your lifeline if you do somefoolish things after reading any of the three books justreviewed. It's called &quot;How to File for Bankruptcy&quot; (NoloPress, 203 pages, $24.95). This book shows how anyintelligent person can use Chapter 7 of the FederalBankruptcy Code to cancel his debts and start fresh. It won'thelp at all in complicated cases such as a married personfiling for bankruptcy separately from a spouse or for peoplein business partnerships. The book explains in some detailwhat property can be kept after bankruptcy and how to fillout the various bankruptcy forms. Unlike most things writtenby attorneys, this cheerful book is in plain English withlittle jargon.   ---   Mr. Angrist writes about the commodities and optionsmarkets for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
