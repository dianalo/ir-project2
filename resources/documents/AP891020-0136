Officials also worked on an environment statement after theleaders of Commonwealth nations left for a weekend retreat onLangkawi Island. Diplomats said differences remained on India'sproposal for an new enviornmental fund, which Britain opposes.   ``On South African sanctions, we've agreed to disagree,'' aCanadian official said privately. No details were released.   Commonwealth leaders were to consider both drafts at Langkawi,where they settled into luxury two-bedroom chalets at a beach hotel210 miles northwest of here in the Straits of Malacca.   Young Malaysian women dressed in sarongs greeted the leaders ofthe 49-nation grouping of Britain and its former colonies, whoarrived at the resort in the rain with their spouses. Police andsoldiers guarded the hotel.   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan also took her babyson, Bilawal Asif, and his governess.   A 10-nation committee of foreign ministers, including John Majorof Britain, met late into the night refining the draft on SouthAfrica.   Diplomats said it incorporated an Australian proposal toincrease financial pressure on the white authorities that Britain,the sole opponent of sanctions, refused to accept.   Representatives of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governmentsaid the draft ``also recognizes a sense of change in South Africaand the need to look at how to set negotiations in train.''   Mrs. Thatcher told the summit F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's newpresident, should be encouraged in his moves toward reform.   Australia countered that pressure should be maintained as longas South Africa continued apartheid, the policy of racediscrimination that enables the 5 million whites to maintainsupremacy over 28 million blacks.   Its proposal would withhold pressure on trade for for about sixmonths to give de Klerk time to deliver on promises of reform.   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.   On the environment, Mrs. Thatcher rejected India's proposal fora fund and said all resources should be channeled through the U.N.World Environmental Program.   Many other delegations also expressed reservations about a newfund.</TEXT></DOC>
