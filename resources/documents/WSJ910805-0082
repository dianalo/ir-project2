MD-11s sell for about $100 million each.   &quot;It's much less of a big deal than people are trying tomake it,&quot; said a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas'stransport aircraft division in Long Beach, Calif.   Nonetheless, the company's share price sank $2.125 toclose at $54.25 Friday in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst with KemperSecurities Group, said some of the stock decline apparentlyreflected profit-taking after McDonnell Douglas shares roseearlier in the week on the strength of its second-quarterearnings report. But he said the Singapore move also probablyspooked some investors, especially because &quot;so far this year,commercial orders for McDonnell Douglas have been somewhat onthe weak side.&quot;   Fuel efficiency has been a burning issue for the MD-11since the three-engine airliner was introduced late lastyear. Carriers have complained that the MD-11 has failed tomeet certain range requirements, whether powered by enginesmade by General Electric Co. or Pratt andamp; Whitney, a unit ofUnited Technologies Corp.   Singapore Airlines said it was counting on the MD-11 toperform on long-range routes, including the 7,200-mile tripfrom Singapore to Paris. &quot;While the aircraft is excellent forshorter-range requirements, it has not to date been able tomeet {Singapore Airlines'} long-haul demands,&quot; the carriersaid in a statement.   The Singapore Airlines MD-11s were to have been equippedwith Pratt andamp; Whitney PW-4000 engines. &quot;We're certainlydisappointed&quot; about the cancellation, said a spokesman forPratt andamp; Whitney. &quot;But Singapore has some relatively uniquerequirements.&quot;   Pratt andamp; Whitney and McDonnell Douglas stressed that theyhave a program in place to enhance the MD-11's range, andboth companies said they are confident they could have metSingapore Airlines' needs well before the carrier would havetaken delivery of the planes.   &quot;We've already made tremendous improvements,&quot; theMcDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said, adding that the companyexpects the issue to be resolved by the end of next year.   The Airbus A-340-300, a new model of the wide-bodyaircraft, will be powered by CFM International 56-5C4engines, which are made by a partnership of General Electricand Snecma of France.   Airbus is a consortium including Aerospatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain, and Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Germany's Daimler-BenzAG.</TEXT></DOC>
