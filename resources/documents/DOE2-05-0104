<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0104 </DOCNO><TEXT>The interaction of vapor-deposited Al with the Ru(0001) surface and itsinfluence upon CO chemisorption has been studied in ultrahigh vacuumby use of Auger electron spectroscopy, thermal desorption mass spectroscopy,and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). Below 670 K, the Al growsas an overlayer in (111) oriented islands. By 1170 K, Al penetrates thesurface to form intermetallic compounds with the Ru, and a (root 3 xroot 3)R30{sup 0} LEED pattern dominates the surface structure. Thisis interpreted in terms of a stoichiometric monolayer of the compoundAl{sub 2}Ru. Thermal desorption data indicate that this monolayer alloyhas a heat of formation of about -24 kcal/mol, compared to -14 kcal/molfor the multilayer alloy which nucleates at higher coverages. The CO/Ruinteraction at the surface of these intermetallic compounds is not verydifferent from that on the clean Ru(0001) surface, except for the expecteddilution of Ru sites by the added Al. In contrast, when the Al overlayerhas not yet been annealed and the Al adatoms still sit on top of theRu(0001) surface, they have a very strong influence upon CO desorptionspectra. A new CO desorption state at 850-1050 K appears at submonolayerAl coverages, which is attributed to strong, direct, interaction betweenadsorbed CO and Al probably involving C-O bond cleavage.</TEXT></DOC>
