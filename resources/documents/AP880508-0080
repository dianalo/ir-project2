American Telephone andamp; Telegraph predicted about 46 million callswould be placed Sunday, topping the old mark of 44 million callsplaced Christmas Day 1987. Actual calling figures were notavailable late Sunday.   About 750 people participated in a Mother's Day protest at thenation's nuclear testing grounds in Nevada, and 323 people,including actor Martin Sheen, were arrested on trespassing charges,authorities said.   While many families shared Mother's Day privately, in SanFrancisco, over 100 mothers from the impoverished Tenderloinneighborhood dined at a Fisherman's Wharf restaurant while fathersand other men from the community took care of their estimated 300children.   In Minneapolis, many of the 1,000 people at the Mother's DayMarch for Peace and Justice used the eighth annual event to showconcern for the future of their children.   ``We've got a world here to pass along to our children, and we'dlike to impress upon people that it would be nice to have a worldthat's safe for children,'' Dr. Phyllis Goldin, chairwoman of theMinneapolis chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, saidduring Saturday's march.   ``I think part of being a responsible parent is takingresponsibility for creating a world of peace and justice,'' saidMary Benrud, a 26-year-old mother of three.   A group with the same goals, the Women's Action for NuclearDisarmament, used a Mother's Day Ball gathering in Boston to honorastronomer Carl Sagan and his wife, author Ann Druyan, for theirefforts to reverse the nuclear arms race.   Hospitals got into the Mother's Day spirit in Connecticut andBaltimore. Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven hired limousines totake new mothers home, while babies at Mercy Medical Center inBaltimore were ``gift-wrapped'' with flowers and pink or blueribbons before being brought to their mothers.   A baby with a new heart was the gift for an Arizona woman whosetwo other children died of heart ailments.   The 6-month-old child, Anthony Lopez, was discharged Sunday fromLoma Linda University Medical Center in California, where heunderwent the five-hour surgery on April 19, said Anita Rockwell, ahospital spokeswoman.   The mother, Liza Lopez, 22, of Glendale, Ariz., called it ``thebest Mother's Day gift she ever had,'' Ms. Rockwell said.</TEXT></DOC>
