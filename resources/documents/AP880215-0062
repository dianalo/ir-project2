Gold prices were little changed.   Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement that theJapanese trade surplus had narrowed sharply to $3.072 billion inJanuary from $8.601 billion in December had reinforced the market'smore positive recent view of the dollar.   However, dealers said a national holiday in the United Statesand a holiday in the northern part of West Germany meant tradingwould be limited and they predicted little movement for the dollar.   ``The Japanese trade figures were very promising, even if notexceptional,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bankin Milan. ``But they solidified the feeling that the dollar mayhave turned the corner.''   But dealers also warned that in such a thin market, anyprofit-taking would exaggerate rate movements.   ``There are no other factors except profit-taking that couldsend the dollar lower,'' said a trader at a major West German bankin Frankfurt.   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, thedollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 131.00. Later, in London, it wasquoted lower at 130.40 yen.   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday'srates:   _ 1.7090 West German marks, down from 1.7123   _ 1.4047 Swiss francs, down from 1.4065   _ 5.7710 French francs, down from 5.7865   _ 1.9165 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9225   _ 1,257.50 Italian lire, down from 1,260.75   _ 1.2660 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2624   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost$1.7450 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7401 on Friday.   Gold was little changed from Friday's prices, but lower than itsopening levels. Dealers said it was pressured by lightprofit-taking.   Bullion markets in Hong Kong were closed for the Chinese NewYear.   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $446.70 a troy ounce, upfrom Friday's late bid of $443.00.
