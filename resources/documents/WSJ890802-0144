You cannot put something down and respect it at the same time.    American children have received mixed messages about teachers. For example: Many movies and TV shows portray teachers as oddballs and nerds (&quot;Mister Peepers&quot;), as being cruel (&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;) or even as being sex fiends (&quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot;). When teachers are portrayed in a &quot;positive&quot; light they are usually saccharine/cutsey or more self-sacrificing than anyone ever wants to be.    Meanwhile, these &quot;oddballs&quot; are told to teach values and morality in addition to the basics, but then get criticized when they do try. They are given a mandate to teach everything a child should be learning at home, without having the power or authority to do the job right.    To make education work, it probably should be separated from politics. As it is now, school administrators walk a tightrope between the demands of the community and the realities of how children really act when they are away from home. It's in an administrator's best interest never to bring bad news to the school board. Consequently, teachers' pleas for help and/or empowerment fall on deaf ears or get lost in the bureaucracy. An administrator must give the impression that he can cope with all problems.    Many school boards run their districts like absentee landlords. They rarely go into the schools for long periods to see what is really happening, mainly because school hours coincide with business hours. And they don't spend enough time talking in a non-threatening way with teachers about solutions, so decisions rarely are based on reality or &quot;grass-roots&quot; input.    Parents know you don't give children everything they ask for. Maybe it's time to realize this is true for communities, too. The result of trying to give everything is that the children get spoiled and the public becomes unreasonable, and both of them lose respect for what they do receive.    Teachers need a massive infusion of respect. Administrators and school boards cannot repress teachers (sometimes using fear tactics on them) and dismiss their concerns, and then expect them to turn around and turn the community's children into confident, well-functioning members of society with the strength to say &quot;no&quot; to today's destructive temptations. David W.C. Koven    Milwaukee    ---   As a senior associate with the Education Department from 1982 to 1987, I would like to say that it seems the National Education Association leadership has been more interested in politics than education.    What works in education? The academic basics. Teachers bought the worthless truism that not every student learns to read the same way, and of course they don't; but when research shows the vast majority of students make considerable gains in reading scores when they are taught by an intensive phonics method that includes reading comprehension, it is time for our schools to convert from the eclectic approach. Similarly, the educational experimenters gave us the disastrous &quot;new math,&quot; and it is time once again to use a method such as Saxon's, which teaches fundamental math skills and concepts through long-term practice.    D.L. Cuddy    Raleigh, N.C.    ---   Let's open this failed governmental system to free enterprise and allow the public's tax money to go to private as well as public schools. Let the parent make the choice. The government's additional obligation then would be to provide regular examinations or other evaluations to ascertain schools' performance with this information made public.    Both public and private schools then would be competing for the tax money, with the parents being the judge. No doubt the competition would force some major changes in the current government-supported self-serving lethargic educational bureaucracy or it would perish.    Emmett J. Murphy    Woodside, Calif.    ---   Why do upper-middle-class, suburban school districts with mostly white, conservative property owners spend $4,500 to $7,000 a pupil when they would be much better off keeping that money in their pockets? Their children enter school with few educational disadvantages and are far less likely to drop out of school; therefore, they are cheaper to educate. These school districts prefer experienced teachers with advanced degrees, pay higher salaries and have low student-teacher ratios. Why do these taxpayers put up with so much wasteful spending? Only the poor are ill-served by our education system.    In the 1984 Texas education reforms, we raised both teacher salaries and per-pupil expenditures as well as increasing standards. Our students' test scores have increased every year, with low-scoring students making the biggest gains.    Gregory Luna    Texas State Representative    Austin, Texas </TEXT></DOC>
