Kroc, the fast-food company's founder.    Their voices hushed, half a dozen workers tap into rows of desktop computers offering 1 1/2 hours of videotaped messages from the late Mr. Kroc. Wearing a sport coat and looking in the pink, the short, balding executive appears on their screens, barking pronouncements from telephones at each terminal.    On cleanliness: &quot;If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean.&quot; On the competition: &quot;If they were drowning to death, I would put a hose in their mouth.&quot; On expansion: &quot;When you're green, you grow; when you're ripe, you rot.&quot;    Ten years after Mr. Kroc stepped away from day-to-day operations at the world's largest fast-food chain, his ghost lives on. His office at McDonald's headquarters here is preserved as a museum, his reading glasses untouched in their leather case on the desk.    Mr. Kroc wasn't averse to new ideas. In fact, he encouraged them -- and had his own, some of them awful. But McDonald's main strategy can be summed up in his three-decades-old philosophy of assemblyline cooking and preparation, fast service, a wholesome image and a near-religious devotion to the hamburger. Today a new generation of McDonald's executives cheers his axioms.    It is an odd corporate culture in an industry where products, promotions and strategies change at a dizzying pace. But its impact is growing. Defying a recent threat by competitors, McDonald's this year raised its share of hamburger restaurants' $25 billion fast-food market by two percentage points, whipping other chains into a frenzy of cost-cutting.    At the same time, the Kroc legacy is beginning to exert an almost Disneylike effect on American culture as the company spreads Mr. Kroc's platitudes and promotional characters through an ever-expanding network of restaurants, charities, sporting events and retail stores. Some critics see serious problems in McDonald's growing influence on youth.    Little has changed in the war rooms of McDonald's suburban headquarters since Mr. Kroc died in 1984. A photograph near his old office shows the former milkshake-machine salesman washing windows at his first McDonald's, the Des Plaines, Ill., hamburger stand he opened 32 years and 60 billion burgers ago.    Few departed corporate chiefs have left such an imprint. Today's executives at McDonalds's cite Mr. Kroc so often that he still seems to be in charge. His photo smiles down on every desk. &quot;When Ray died, people worried that his vision couldn't be kept alive,&quot; says Sharon Vuinovich, assistant vice president for accounting. &quot;But we're doing that.&quot;    That vision, however, also harnesses his heirs to some unfashionable strategies:    For years, the company refused to appeal to health-conscious consumers by following an industry move to salads.    Mr. Kroc's quick-cooking systems aren't geared to the individualized service that competitors say today's sophisticated consumer wants. &quot;We don't want Ray Kroc's kind of burgers, all dressed the same with dehydrated onions,&quot; says Robert L. Barney, the chairman of Wendy's International Inc., the No. 3 hamburger chain. (Actually, you can get a hamburger your way at McDonald's, but it will take longer than if you get it their way.)    And McDonald's shuns diversification at a time when competitors are courting jaded consumers with a flood of new restaurant concepts.    Aided by these apparent weaknesses, McDonald's trendy competitors seemed poised a few years ago to derail Mr. Kroc's dream. In an ad campaign, No. 2 Burger King Corp., the Pillsbury Co. unit that flame-broils its burgers, attacked the quality of McDonald's burgers grilled according to Mr. Kroc's quick-cooking dictates, and scored sharp market-share gains. A similarly tough Wendy's campaign featured the prize-winning Clara Peller as its &quot;Where's the Beef?&quot; inquisitor, making such Kroc-era characters as Ronald McDonald look outmoded by comparison.    At the same time, Wendy's and other chains rolled out a succession of flashy new products, from salad bars to potato skins, that made McDonald's menu look dull. The assault gave rise to a new round of predictions that McDonald's would at last fall victim to stagnation and market saturation.    But this year Big Mac came roaring back. Aided by competitors' marketing and service slip-ups -- a recent Burger King advertising campaign featuring Herb, a bespectacled nerd who had never visited a Burger King, was an embarrassing flop -- McDonald's market share rose to 36%, from 34%, in 1985. The gains came partly at the expense of Burger King and Wendy's, whose combined market share fell to 27% from 28%. Analysts see McDonald's 1987 profit rising about 15% to $551 million from last year's record $480 million. The company's revenue last year was $4.24 billion.    &quot;If you stand in McDonald's way cooking a better burger, they just roll over you like a tank,&quot; says Ronald N. Paul, a Chicago restaurant consultant.    McDonald's staged a new-product comeback as well. The company this year finally fielded plain, packaged salads suitable for easy sale to the drive-in window customers who buy 40% of fast foods. Seven months after national introduction, the salads already account for 7% of McDonald's total sales. &quot;You have to keep shooting silver bullets to stop McDonald's,&quot; says George Rice, a Chicago restaurant researcher.    These latest successes of McDonald's have touched off a scramble among competitors. Wendy's, barely out of the red, is adding an Italian-Mexican buffet. Burger King, reeling from a 41% profit decline in the fiscal year ended May 31, is laying off workers, slashing building costs and trying to recover from the Herb the Nerd debacle. &quot;It was dumb, didn't sell burgers and cost $40 million,&quot; grumbles William Prentice, a Burger King franchisee in Fayetteville, N.C.    Big Mac has never been closer to realizing Mr. Kroc's dream of a world-wide chain. With 9,800 McDonald's -- 7,500 of them in the U.S. -- already dispensing burgers in 46 countries, his disciples continue to open new restaurants at a rate of one every 17 hours; less than 0.5% of the new units fail. McDonald's dispenses nearly one out of every three hamburgers served in U.S. restaurants and more than one-fourth of the french fries. And consumers in awareness surveys name McDonald's more often than the next six chains combined. Steven A. Rockwell, an analyst at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, says: &quot;They're doing fine just following {Mr. Kroc's} guidelines.&quot;    One reason is the company's tight rein on owner-operators. From the beginning, Mr. Kroc retained ownership of most of McDonald's buildings and land and barred franchisees from operating other kinds of restaurants or being absentee owners.    Even the wealthiest of McDonald's 2,100 franchisees -- nearly one-fourth of whom are millionaires -- are still required to clean the lots of neighboring competitors. Angelo Lencioni, a Chicago franchisee, sends a crew out every morning to sweep the sidewalk for an entire block, in front of the neighboring Burger King and Taco Bell and down the stairs to the subway. &quot;We try to give people a good impression of the neighborhood,&quot; he says.    At the same time, franchisees are encouraged to spend enormous energy on the tiniest details of their operations. &quot;Ray taught us to put yourself in the customer's place,&quot; says Michael R. Quinlan, the president and chief executive officer.    Michael Magruder, the owner of four McDonald's in California's prosperous Marin County, spent hours practicing on more than 300 burgers, trying to figure out a way of folding them in paper without leaving a thumbprint on the bun. &quot;Customers resent food that looks shoved around,&quot; he explains. The result was the new &quot;thumbless burger&quot; -- a breakthrough praised at the giant chain's headquarters and videotaped for training managers at every McDonald's.    &quot;McDonald's is winning on good service,&quot; says Mr. Paul, the restaurant consultant.    Largely by example, Mr. Kroc also encouraged franchisees to tinker endlessly with products and promotions. At Hamburger University here, instructors still ridicule Mr. Kroc's marketing bombs to assure trainees that bad ideas won't be held against them. Aspiring managers roar with laughter at the founder's ill-fated Hula Burger -- a meatless concoction of pineapple and cheese -- and a caramel-pecan roll with a glaze that just wouldn't stick.    These days franchisees generate most of McDonald's best ideas, including the Egg McMuffin and fried apple pie. Franchisees and their local ad agencies also contribute about 20% of McDonald's promotions.    That emphasis on operations at the franchisee level keeps McDonald's top-management bureaucracy tiny -- and decidedly anti-elitist, as Mr. Kroc dictated. A high-school dropout, Mr. Kroc often reminded his disciples that &quot;the world is full of educated derelicts.&quot; Says Ms. Vuinovich: &quot;It's the only company where you don't tell people you have an M.B.A. It might be held against you.&quot;    Fearful that management would lose touch with the kitchen, Mr. Kroc warned managers not to &quot;get fat in the head with power or become arrogant.&quot; Today, 10,000 executives and suppliers, from Mr. Quinlan, the $603,000-a-year president and chief executive officer, on down, still pay homage to Mr. Kroc on &quot;Founder's Day&quot; every Oct. 9 by cooking and cleaning in a restaurant. This past October Ms. Vuinovich found herself elbow-deep in lettuce and tomato in a San Francisco McDonald's, making salads for a busload of German tourists.    To commemorate another directive of Mr. Kroc's -- avoid a &quot;one-chair barbershop&quot; management style -- the company's top four managers all decorate their offices with barber chairs.    Critics deride the Kroc legacy as a simple-minded corporate cult that tricks consumers into eating junk food by soothing such raw nerves as their desire for service, security and predictability. &quot;Many of us seek comfort under the golden arches,&quot; says Yolanda Wesely, a New York market researcher. &quot;We know we'll get instant gratification without being ripped off. It's like a visit to a parent.&quot;    And McDonald's seeks constantly to deepen its psychological appeal to consumers. Since Mr. Kroc urged franchisees to add community relations to the company's arsenal of marketing weapons, they have opened 107 Ronald McDonald Houses, which provide free or low-cost room and board to families visiting children's hospitals. The company and its franchisees also gave more than $50 million to charity last year and sponsored dozens of amateur athletic competitions.    &quot;Twenty years ago, we decided we wanted an image beyond food, based on strong virtues,&quot; says Paul D. Schrage, McDonald's chief marketing officer. &quot;We put up a value structure that's difficult to penetrate. It makes us dependable in a world of strange new things like American flags on Kuwaiti ships.&quot;    McDonald's relentless drive to expand has also led it to focus much of its $789 million advertising and promotion budget (more than the total of its four largest competitors) on children. Ms. Wesely likens McDonald's to the 19th-century missionary movement that sought to convert entire populations. &quot;McDonald's,&quot; she says, &quot;follows the missionaries' tactic: Get to the children and they're yours for life.&quot; Roughly one-third of McDonald's 20 million customers each week are children.    &quot;McDonald's is acculturating tens of millions of kids to a diet of fat and sodium,&quot; says Michael Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group.    Some critics say McDonald's takes advantage of children by equating such values as honesty with the food it advertises. &quot;McDonald's fairy tales teach children moral lessons and to eat french fries. I'm concerned about values being taught merely by choices of products,&quot; says Richard A. Peterson, a professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University.    As McDonald's extends its marketing reach, it is beginning to rival the Disney entertainment empire in its influence and visibility in American culture, marketing experts say. And it is influencing other cultures as well. &quot;Their ads act as if all cultures should be the same as ours or they're missing something. That's a bad message,&quot; says Arthur Kleinman, a professor of anthropology and psychiatry at Harvard University. &quot;Why not let Asia develop its own fast food? Maybe fish and noodle stems would be better.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Kroc continues to preach expansion daily in his dark museum. &quot;The only definition of saturation is a sponge; there's really no limit,&quot; his video image intones. Therein, critics say, lies McDonald's chief vulnerability. The giant chain's esprit de corps demands continual expansion, continual promotion of kitchen workers to manager and franchisee. Whether Big Mac can continue to defy experts' predictions of saturation remains to be seen.    A pause, admits Frank J. Gowens Jr., McDonald's training manager, &quot;would wipe the smiles off a lot of faces around here.&quot;    ---            The Largest Restaurant Chain by Far   Restaurant companies ranked by system-wide sales in theU.S. (includes franchise sales)                                    U.S. SALES     TOTAL NO.
