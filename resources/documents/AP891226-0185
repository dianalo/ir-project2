Anything about housing has a wide audience. More than 60 percentof households own their homes, and many renters would like to own.   Homeowners have big investments. They worry about their money,and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it.That includes forecasts, and helps explain why forecasts of housingdebacles never cease.   Several years ago, in fact, a book was written about the comingcollapse of housing prices. The event was never recorded by anyeconomic statistic or seismograph, but it didn't deter theforecaster.   Similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surestbet you can make is that the outpouring of doom, much of it fromfinancial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only,will continue in 1990.   At the moment, in fact, there exists a popular notion thatsingle-family home sales and prices have declined sharply in muchof the country, especially in the Northeast. Specific collapses,always available, are used to illustrate.   The specifics, however, don't always make a generalization.   National data show that the median price of existingsingle-family homes in October 1988 was $88,900. One year later, inOctober of this year, it was $92,100. That's a gain of 3.6 percent.   Data for the Northeast, compiled by the National Association ofRealtors, shows the price of typical new single-family homes inOctober 1988 was $144,400, and in October 1989 $143,300. That's adecline of 0.8 percent, hardly a disaster and one barely worthmentioning in the stock market.   At that, the significance might be overdone. Oddly, that declinein the price of new houses, tiny as it is, might indicate strengthrather than weakness. To wit:   Falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier hadbeen priced out of the market. Clearly, these people wouldn't seekthe most expensive homes; they would buy in the middle ranges,creating a lower median.   In spite of warnings and forecasts, home prices have beenremarkably stable or strong year after year. Industrial andcommercial real estate might not have done well, but single-familyhousing is distinct from them.   What has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans,and in this way a banking problem becomes a so-called crisis inreal estate.   Since 1972, Census Bureau figures show not one year in whichprices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally,although there have indeed been been regional or local declines.   But, while bad news in one stock, unless it is IBM or GeneralMotors, rarely is used to suggest a general market decline, thatreasoning isn't always applied to housing.   Housing is, in fact, an even better investment than shown onsome popular Wall Street charts of relative values. Most charts ofcomparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing tothe total price. However, most Americans put down but a fraction ofthe price when buying homes. They take loans instead.   When ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price ratherthan go on margin, or borrow from the broker. To borrow may beunwise because of volatility. So, if a $10 stock rises $1 theyusually have a 10 percent gain.   When a $50,000 house, bought with $5,000 down, rises in value to$55,000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent. But, since it waspurchased with only $5,000 down the real return to the homeowner is100 percent.   The homeowner pays interest on the mortgage, and real estatetaxes, insurance and upkeep, but he or she also receives big incometax deductions not available to shareowners, and gets to sleep inthe home-investment.   Remember it the next time financial ``experts'' proclaim the endof the world in housing. And remember, some of these are the sameones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in badloans for banks.</TEXT></DOC>
