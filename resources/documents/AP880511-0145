The march began after a military court sentenced the leader of aJanuary 1987 coup attempt to 12 years hard labor.   Late Tuesday, the court convicted a total of 106 officers andenlisted men of various charges in connection with the coupattempt, which the government said was aimed at restoring Marcos topower.   Marcos supporters marched at midday to the Mendiola Bridge, 300yards from the presidential compound, where 200 riot police stoodguard. The bridge was blocked by barbed wire and two water-cannontrucks.   Protesters set off firecrackers and carried banners reading``Cory regime - heartless'' and urging President Reagan to allowMarcos to leave his Hawaiian exile and return for the funeral ofhis mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos.   Marchers chanted ``Bring Back Marcos'' and ``Cory governmentresign.'' Col. Emiliano Templo, deputy capital region commander,estimated the crowd at between 8,000 and 10,000.   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos, 95, died May 4. Here body has been lying instate at a suburban church, and no date has been set for thefuneral. Relatives hope Mrs. Aquino will change her mind and allowMarcos to attend.   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return for thefuneral, saying he threatens national security. Marcos supportershave been linked to several coup attempts against the Aquinogovernment.   Marcos fled to Hawaii after a civilian-military uprising toppledhis 20-year administration and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power inFebruary 1986.   The Reagan administration barred Marcos from leaving Hawaiiwithout permission after the Aquino government claimed he hadchartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attemptsucceeded.   During the Jan. 27, 1987 attempt, hundreds of dissident soldiersstormed media and military facilities in the Manila area, takingcontrol of a few media facilities but surrendering about 60 hourslater. One mutineer was killed.   Late Tuesday, a military court sentenced the leader, Lt. Col.Oscar Canlas, and 10 others to 12 years imprisonment at hard labor.They were convicted of mutiny, illegal possession of weapons, beingabsent without leave and conduct unbecoming an officer.   Twenty-nine other soldiers were sentenced to six years in prisonand 66 received six-month sentences for being absent without leave.   The trial lasted nearly a year.</TEXT></DOC>
