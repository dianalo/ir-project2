But Compaq Computer Corp., IBM's top rival in speedy personalcomputers, hinted it would strike back with one even faster thatwould reach the market before IBM's. Compaq has scheduled a productannouncement for June 20.   ``In the time frame that IBM has indicated they might delivertheir product, we will continue to have the highest performance386-based machines in the marketplace,'' said Michael Swavely, vicepresident for marketing at Houston-based Compaq.   IBM said the fastest version of its new Model 70, to beavailable in the July-September period, will be up to 50 percentfaster than the Model 80, its fastest currently available computer.Its price will be $11,295.   IBM also announced two other versions of the Model 70 availableimmediately, starting at $5,995, and a version of its Model 50starting at $3,995 that is up to 35 percent faster than the currentmodel.   Also introduced was a version of the Model 25, the smallest andcheapest member of the Personal System-2 family, that is designedfor use in office networks. Hard disk drives are also available forthe Model 25 for the first time. Those products are available thismonth.   IBM said the new computers are up to five times more reliablethan the original PC, introduced in 1981. It said its one-yearmaintenance contract on a Model 60 is about $200 a year, comparedto the $600 to $800 a year charged by competitors for computers ofsimilar power.   IBM reduced prices on the Model 60 and Model 80 by 5 to 18percent to keep them in line with the improved new models. Analystsare expecting announcements of improvements in those products incoming months.</TEXT></DOC>
