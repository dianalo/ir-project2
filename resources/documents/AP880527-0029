Actual quantities of shipments may reach 145.5 million metrictons, up from 129.2 million tons last year, the USDA said Thursday.   Export values dropped to a decade low of $26.3 billion two yearsago but improved slightly to $27.9 billion in 1986-87. The tonnageof shipments dropped to 109.5 million tons in 1985-86 beforerecovering in 1986-87.   Despite this year's gains, the current estimates are still farbelow the record of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreigncompetition, a rising value of the U.S. dollar and other factorstriggered the slide.   The new foreast also was up by $1 billion and 3 million tonsfrom USDA's previous estimate on Feb. 25.   Officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal products,horticultural products and soybeans. The boost in tonnage``reflects improved prospects for wheat, feed ingredients andsoybeans,'' the report said.   The value of animal products was boosted $600 million from theFebruary forecast to a record of $5.6 billion this year, due to``stronger-than-expected demand for hides, red meats and animalfats,'' the report said.   ``Most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exportsas the Export Enhancement Program and tighter competitor suppliesboost the U.S. share of world markets,'' the report said. ``Also,higher prices are expected for grains, oilseeds and cotton.''   Under the EEP arrangement, selected countries _ including theSoviet Union and China _ have been getting wheat and otherdesignated commodities at prices subsidized by the U.S. government.   Imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecastat a record $21 billion, up $500 million from the Februaryestimate. Last year's imports dropped slightly to $20.6 billionfrom $20.9 billion in 1985-86, the previous high mark.   But as a result of export values climbing more rapidly, the U.S.agricultural trade balance _ the difference between exports andimports _ is expected to rise sharply to $12.5 billion from $7.3billion last year.   However, the 1987-88 balance would still be far less than the$19.1 billion edge U.S. farm exports had over imports in 1983-84.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald D. Plowman says he has no plans tocarry out a massive reorganization of the Agriculture Department'sprimary science agency, the Agricultural Research Service.   Plowman, who will collect an estimated $126,500 a year to headup the agency, has been rumored as having been tabbed to revamp theagency, including the pruning of a number of high-level jobs.   But Plowman, who is head of the department of animal, dairy andveterinary sciences at Utah State University, told The AssociatedPress on Thursday that he has no such intentions.   ``They've been reorganized to death,'' he said. ``We're going towork with what we've got.''   Plowman's USDA job appointment was announced on April 15 byAgriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng at a salary of $77,500 a year.   It was subsequently disclosed, however, that Plowman _ whoretired from the USDA agency in 1984 after 27 years to go to workfor Utah State _ will be on loan from the university under a lawfularrangement that will permit him to continue drawing his federalretirement income, estimated at $35,000 a year. Additionally, hewill get $14,000 a year in per diem to help with relocation and thehigher costs of living in Washington.   Technically, the university will pay Plowman's $77,500 salary ashead of the USDA agency, but the department then will reimburseUtah State for that amount.   However, if Plowman, 59, at some point in the future decides torejoin USDA permanently, he will have to give up his retirementincome, at least until retiring again from the federal government.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A decision by the Agriculture Department toloosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production ``indicates theUnited States intends to be a grain seller, not a grain storer,''says the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers.   Frank Johannsen, a Bayard, Neb., wheat farmer, referred in astatement released Thursday to an earlier USDA announcement thatproducers would be required to idle no more than 10 percent oftheir wheat base acreage to qualify for 1989 program benefits. Theacreage set-aside was 27.5 percent for 1988.   But Johannsen said the smaller land-idling requirement``requires a continuing federal commitment'' to operate the ExportEnchancement Program, or EEP, which has helped reduce surplus U.S.wheat stockpiles.   Under EEP, selected foreign countries _ including the SovietUnion and China _ have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat atsubsidized prices.   ``We intend to work closely with USDA and the Congress to seethat existing export assistance programs are used effectively andthat the past oversupply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur,'' hesaid.   ``For 50 years _ and often to its detriment _ the United Stateshas held virtually all the world's surplus grain,'' Johannsenadded. ``With the 1989 wheat program, we shift that burden to ourcompetitors.''</TEXT></DOC>
