Developer Thomas W. Moye and Boca Raton, Fla.-based Commercial Center Development Corp., which he controls, are seeking more than $100 million in damages from AmeriFirst Bank, a Federal Savings Bank, a Miami-based thrift that operated Sunrise under the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.'s management consignment program, and others involved in construction projects.    In a suit filed in June in state circuit court here, Mr. Moye alleges that AmeriFirst and others mishandled construction projects that his company had turned over to Sunrise for completion with an option to repurchase. The complaint alleges that Commercial Center Development had contracts to sell the projects to third parties, but that the AmeriFirst management team and others delayed completion of the projects and unreasonably increased construction costs.    Robert Benner, executive vice president and chief financial officer of AmeriFirst said: &quot;If any suit is proper, and we don't think it is, it would be against FSLIC, not us.&quot;    The acquisition of AmeriFirst by a unit of Miami-based American Capital Corp. is awaiting regulatory clearance and shareholder approval.    Sunrise was a high-flying thrift that grew rapidly during its short life between 1980 and 1985. Federal regulators declared Sunrise insolvent and seized it in July 1985. The thrift was placed under the management of AmeriFirst. In September 1986, it was closed and reopened as Beach Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association -- minus the bad loans.    Mr. Moye, his associate, William Frederick, and three former top Sunrise officers are awaiting trial on federal criminal charges of conspiracy, misapplication of bank funds and making false statements in connection with more than $120 million in loans made for real-estate development between 1983 and 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
