It concludes that Washington D.C. should also try to attract more information service companies and biotechnology concerns that could benefit from being near federal agencies and academic institutions.    The study entitled &quot;Washington D.C., A World Capital?&quot; was prepared by six Harvard Business School students for Julien J. Studley Inc., a New York-based real-estate services firm. The results are intended for use by local government policy makers and trade groups in Washington, as well as by real-estate and corporate relocation professionals.    In addition to examining Washington's business climate and real-estate development potential, the researchers surveyed the attitudes of 209 of their senior classmates at Harvard Business School. They also asked 206 undergraduate students of various majors at Washington area colleges where they envision themselves living and working.    The students overwhelmingly agreed that New York is &quot;the most prestigious corporate address&quot; and has the most career opportunities. The business school students, however, ranked New York's quality of life last among eight large metropolitan areas, and named San Francisco's number one. Meanwhile, the college students cited Washington first and New York as number two.    Says Julien J. Studley, whose company sponsored the report, &quot;The Harvard Business School students did not look upon Washington D.C., as a place to go upon graduation. But they did see themselves in Washington ten and twenty years from now.&quot;    One implication, he concludes, is that while Washington does not have the financial services companies that attract MBAs today, the students believe more such banking and investment firms will be there in the future. If so, this would contrast with New York, where the number of financial services jobs is contracting.    The consulting and law professions, currently well-represented in Washington, are likely to expand further, the study found. One key reason is the capital's growth as an international center. The report states that Washington, with its concentration of federal agencies and proximity to law- and policymakers, will become a more important business hub by the time European trade barriers are dismantled in 1992.    In particular, there will be more international banking institutions -- particularly foreign government banks -- in Washington, says Stephen B. Goldstein, who heads Mr. Studley's Washington office.    Mr. Studley's report acknowledged Washington's problems with education, drugs, crime and poverty and noted that the District, like every city, must address these issues to improve its economic climate. It also recommended that the district ease real-estate development restrictions on building height, which it said limit opportunities to attract large corporations.    Advances in communication technology that limit companies' need to cluster in a central business district could also lure companies to the Washington area. Large information companies may relocate to the region where Gannett Co. and MCI Communications are already based, the study suggests, posing direct competition for New York. </TEXT></DOC>
