A strong business commitment to biotechnology is benefiting thepublic by creating products that can unclog heart vessels, easetransplants and treat diseases such as diabetes, leukemia andhemophilia, the Washington-based group stated in a news release.   ``Biotechnology is changing the very nature of this industry andwill have a profound effect on medical treatment in the yearsahead,'' the group's president, Gerald J. Mossinghoff, said in aprepared statement.   But the heated competition between companies also is leading toconflicts over property rights, because many companies are at workon similar products, the industry organization said.   ``Uncertainty over property rights and lack of information aboutpatents could lead to wasted resources, longer development timesand higher development costs,'' the group said.   The survey also found:   _Forty of the 81 drugs and vaccines in development are forvarious types of cancers, making cancer the most frequentlytargeted disease of biotechnology-based products.   _Seven of the 81, none yet approved, are aimed at AIDS.   _Americans won 80 percent of the 206 genetic engineering patentsissued by the U.S. Patent Office last year, while Japan was adistant second with about 9 percent, the survey found.   _U.S. corporations led the list of recipients of geneticengineering patents last year, with 45 percent.   Sloan-Kettering Institute, the New York research institution,was the top receipient of genetic engineering patents last year,with 13.   But the rest of the top four were all private companies: CetusCorp., with 11; Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., with nine; andGenentech and Eli Lilly, each with eight.   Of the products already on the market, the best-known areGenentech Inc.'s heart attack drug, Activase, which dissolves bloodclots; Merck andamp; Co. Inc.'s hepatitis B vaccine; and Eli Lilly andCo.'s genetically-engineered human insulin for diabetics.   The 81 products in development include 67 that are being testedon people in clinical trials and 14 that have completed trials andare awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration.   Patent protection for biotechnology advances is critical becausecompanies want to make sure that they will be able to earn a fairreturn on their heavy investments.   The Office of Patents and Trademarks has cut down the backlog ofbiotechnology patent applications, to 6,500 from 7,800 a year ago,but it still takes an average of more than four years to processapplications, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said.   To deal with the backlog, the patent office is reorganizing andassigning a larger portion of new examiners at higher pay tobiotech patents. The goal is to cut the processing time to 18months by 1993 or 1994, the association said.</TEXT></DOC>
