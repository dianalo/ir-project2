The dollar ended the day's trading at 128.30 yen, up 0.65 yenfrom Friday's close of 127.65 yen. It traded in a range of128.20-128.63 yen and was quoted at 128.50 yen at midday.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225selected issues, a 53.56-point winner Friday, closed 146.67 pointsor 0.4 percent lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at a recordhigh 32,131.99 points.   A hike in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11 percentby many American commercial banks and the news of ahigher-than-expected U.S. producer price index for January, bothannounced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's rally, said a dealerat the Bank of Tokyo.   The dollar dipped slightly in midmorning selling, but reboundedsomewhat later. Trading was slow, the dealer said.   The dollar's direction hinges on what happens to overseasinterest rates, so players here are inclined, in the absence of anycompelling incentives to trade during Tokyo business hours, to letthe European and U.S. markets take the lead, the dealer added,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The prime lending rate is closely watched because bankers use itas a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and fordetermining various types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumerloans, including home equity loans.   Higher U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive toforeign investors, but tend to have a negative impact on stockprices.   Kazuhiro Nakamura of Wako Securities said Tokyo share pricesdeclined in reaction to the interest rate hike and also to thedefeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Sunday in a closelywatched parliamentary by-election.   The election was seen as an indication of public sentiment towardthe LDP following the passage of a long-sought tax reform packagelast December that included introduction of an unpopular 3 percentsales tax.</TEXT></DOC>
