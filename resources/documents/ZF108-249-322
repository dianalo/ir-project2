 Then, the MIS community discovered 'good' outsourcing and 'bad'outsourcing.andP;  Now, it's being placed on MIS managers' agendas as a topic thatgenerates great debate and confusion.andM;But few doubt that the interest shown in outsourcing in the US last year willcontinue to build in 1990.andP;  Unprecedented pressure on MIS departments to cutcosts and divert their resources is spurring companies to weigh outsourcing'sbenefits.andM;And as US business undergoes tumultuous changes and the use of informationsystems matures, many corporate executives are finding that their MISdepartments require very careful management.andM;Unfortunately though, outsourcing has been awarded buzzword status in theindustry, leading to confusion, misunderstanding and fear.andP;  Vendors such asIBM, Electronic Data Systems and Andersen Consulting are rapdily blurringtraditional boundaries in the market-place -- to offer a supermarket ofservices including outsourcing and systems integration.andM;Meanwhile, users such as Estman Kodak and Merrill Lynch are approachingoutsourcing in different ways -- still clouding the definition.andM;Gradually though, and with increasing certainty, executives in thesecompanies are concluding that the promised productivity which was theirreason for investing in information technology in the first place, will notmaterialize unless drastic measures are taken.andM;So outsourcing is being seriously considered as a potential solution torising computer costs.andP;  Any MIS manager anywhere, who at the momentanticipates the need for a budget increase and whose organization fits thedescription of a good candidate for outsourcing, would do well to study thefinancial and organizational benefits it brings.andM;Now, more than every, department is required to cut cost excesses to gaingreater profitability.andP;  Additionally, competitive pressure from around theworld is creating a restructuring of business and demanding the integrationof processes.andM;The fast-paced change of the computer market is partially to blame as well.andO;Some companies are beginning to question the value of their computerinvestments.andP;  Many are tired of spending millions on hardware and softwarethat may be obsolete next year.andM;The quest for the right machines for the right people also becomes even morefutile when neither seems to exist.andM;Further, the challenge of keeping up with technological changes becomes moredifficult without the skilled people required for today's mainframeoperations.andP;  The pressure of reduced budgets is adding more fuel to the fire.andM;Outsourcing can help ease organizational problems in several ways.andP;  In thepast, outsourcing was available in the form of such speciality applicationsas payroll, insurance processing, credit cards and mailing lists, and wasoffered by service bureaux.andP;  Today, however, the outsourcing of entiremanagement information functions is an option.andM;The most recent increase in service bureau-type activity has occurred in thearea of data centre outsourcing -- where in-house data centres are turnedinto remote data-entry operations, and the mainframes are owned and operatedoffsite by a remote computer service company.andM;But while few would argue that severe, perhaps drastic, measures need to betaken to diminish the financial drain caused by MIS offices, executivesaren't sure of the best way to go about it.andM;William Morgan, MIS vice president for Copperweld Corp, is an advocate foroutsourcing because it leads to &quot;greater than imagined personal cost savingsand productivity gains&quot;.andM;In what was initially a budget-cutting measure, Copperweld, a Fortune 500company in the 1970s, focused on the MIS department in an effort to reduceits employee numbers and excess costs.andP;  Morgan reports that: &quot;We save [lots]of money.andP;  But another reason why we turned our data processing over tooutsiders was the proper allocation of resources.andP;  We can now focus onprofit-generating opportunities, not problems.&quot;andM;But Stefan Gladyszewski, director of operations systems at General Signal,voices many people's concern about outsourcing: &quot;Why would a companyoutsource the lifeblood of its business -- the information?&quot;andM;Gladyszewski feels that service bureaux focus on two very emotional issues.andO;The first is the reduction of costs, and the second a more nebulous 'We'llget this under control for you'.andP;  While both are important considerations,any company serious about the long-term contribution of automation to itsbusiness, &quot;can do a better job of managing this critical resource than anoutsider&quot;.andM;Some confusion arises because outsourcing bears such a similarity to theservice-bureaux and time-sharing operations of the 1960s and '70s -- it lookslike the modern reworking of an old theme.andP;  The time sharing of yesterday'snumber-crunching mainframes has given way to simply running applicationsremotely on a service vendor's hardware.andM;But outsourcing is (and will continue to be) part of the wider trend incorporate US to carefully examine departments for possible cost savings.andO;Outsourcing of operations will continue to grow by 17 per cent annuallythrough to 1994, predicts the US research comapny Input.andM;But in 1990 and beyond, the key question facing MIS departments is not justwhether to outsource but what to outsource.andP;  Following Kodak's example in1989, many senior executives, anxious to find new options, will take a lookat outsourcing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
