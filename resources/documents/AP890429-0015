The Washington Post and The New York Times reported the decisionwas made Friday by President Bush's Economic Policy Council. Thedecision could result in imposing penalty tariffs on similarJapanese products under the new trade law passed by Congress lastyear, the papers said.   The decision came as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hillscharged that 34 countries are erecting unfair barriers to U.S.products, in a move that could eventually lead to 100 percenttariffs against some imports.   The trade representative office's general counsel, JoshuaBolten, and spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, could not be reached athome Friday night to confirm the reports on sanctions againstJapan. Such sanctions would be the first ordered since 1987, whenthe Reagan administration accused Japan of failing to keep anagreement to buy more U.S. semiconductors.   The Times quoted Hills as saying that public hearings will beheld sometime in May to determine what Japanese products andservices might be subject to retaliation.   Hills' report on the trade barriers took 18 pages to list thecomplaints against Japan, the most for any country. The 12-nationEuropean Community and South Korea were next, each with nine pagesof complaints.   The accusations of trade barriers covered a wide range ofproducts from shipments of autos to Argentina to the sales ofAmerican cigarettes in Yugoslavia.   In addition to the 34 nations, two trading organizations arenamed. Those are the EC and the Gulf Cooperation Council, whichincludes Saudi Arabia.   The report is the first step in drawing up a ``hit list'' ofpriority countries the administration will target for intensivenegotiations aimed at getting the trade barriers eliminated. Thatpriority list, drawn from the countries mentioned Friday, is due onMay 30.   The United States must initiate negotiations with the countrieson the priority list with a deadline of achieving results within 18months. The countries then would have three years to live up to theagreements and remove the trade barriers America finds offensive.   Should the negotiations prove unfruitful or a country fail toimplement the agreement, the trade law gives the administration thepower to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected imports.   The procedure set up by the Omnibus Trade Act was the mostcontroversial section of the 1988 law, which Congress passed in aneffort to force the executive branch to take a tougher stance towhittle down the country's huge trade deficits.   Many economists said at the time the legislation was debatedthat the effort could backfire and set off a global trade war inwhich U.S. attempts to punish unfair trade practices are met bycounter-retaliation against American goods.   Foreign governments, concerned by the tight deadlines fornegotiations to be completed, have already begun intensive lobbyingefforts to keep from being placed on the priority list.   While the law provides various loopholes a president could useto avoid imposing retaliatory tariffs, a failure to act would haveto be explained to Congress.   American companies have filed petitions with Hills' officerecommending that close to 50 countries be placed on the prioritynegotiating list. South Korea has the most complaints filed againstit by U.S. businesses followed by Japan, India, Taiwan, Brazil andthe European Community.   Officials from those nations have mounted their owncounterattack, dispatching their top trade officials to Washingtonfor meetings with top administration officials to press their casethat their countries should not be singled out.   The debate has been particularly intense with regard to Japan.Some in the administration have expressed concerns about applyingfurther trade pressure on Japan at a time the country is facinginternal turmoil with the announced resignation of Japanese PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita.   But Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the trade subcommitteeof the Senate Finance Committee, said last week the administrationwould be ``cutting the heart out of'' the new trade law if itdidn't target Japan.   In Friday's report, the countries named were Argentina,Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, WestGermany, Finland, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
