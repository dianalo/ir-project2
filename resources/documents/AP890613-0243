Brittan said he expects the regulations, which would allow ECbanks to operate across their borders, to pass within a month.   But the licensing proposal has raised controversy because of itsso-called reciprocity clause.   Some EC members worried that foreign banks might be excluded fromoperating in the Community unless EEC banks were given equivalentadvantages abroad.   Sir Leon amended the proposal earlier this year. Under thechanges, the EEC would open negotiations with countries whosebanking regimes were less liberal than its own but wouldn'tsystematically suspend an application by a foreign bank while itreviews access to the foreign bank's home country.</TEXT></DOC>
