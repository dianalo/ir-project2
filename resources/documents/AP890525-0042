Bespectacled office workers and elderly women in baggy trouserssay they are all for democratic reform, but what really angers themis nepotism and ``guandao,'' the official corruption they must dealwith every day.   ``Mao sent his son to Korea, Deng sends his children toAmerica,'' goes one popular slogan, which by the contrast accusestoday's Communist Party leaders of furthering their own interestsinstead of serving the public.   One of Mao Tse-tung's sons died in the Korean War, while severalof senior leader Deng Xiaoping's children have had extended staysin the United States.   Ordinary Chinese view with helplessness and rage the power ofhigh officials to send their sons and daughters abroad, obtain goodhousing and cars and buy amenities.   Common people often cannot buy a train ticket or a goodtelevision unless they know the right people. The ``back door'' isthe most common entrance for getting many goods and services, andeverything comes with a price, ranging from ``gifts'' of cigarettesand free meals to cash bribes.   Officials' access to sought-after goods has made themsusceptible to bribery. Many consider receiving money, lavishbanquets, color television sets or stereos all part of the job.   Newspapers regularly report how officials stockpile scarce goodssuch as fertilizer and steel, buying them up at artificially lowstate-set prices and selling them for huge profits on the freemarket.   Despite a government crackdown last year, many officials stilluse their positions to set up companies that distribute _ for ahealthy profit _ hard-to-get raw materials and resources.   One of the first posters to go up at Beijing University duringthe student upheaval listed several dozen senior officials who italleged got their jobs because of family connections.   Premier Li Peng, it noted, was the adopted son of the late ChouEn-lai. People's Liberation Army Chief of Staff Chi Haotian isPresident Yang Shangkun's son-in-law.   A recent survey of 10,000 workers found that 46 percent listedcorruption as China's most serious social problem and 63 percentsaid improper deeds by party members was a major political problem.   Chinese courts handled 37,000 cases of official profiteeringlast year, up 50 percent from 1987, and 101 embezzlers andbribe-takers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment.   Local governments have set up neighborhood centers whereordinary people can report official abuses of power without fear ofrecrimination.   But most agree that corruption is here to stay until Chinaalleviates imbalances in supply and demand and closes the wide gapbetween subsidized state-set and free market prices.</TEXT></DOC>
