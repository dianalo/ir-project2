(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Complaints from the widow of famed footballcoach Vince Lombardi helped prompt the arrests of hundreds ofhomosexual men at a turnpike service area named after him, a statepolice spokesman says.   Marie Lombardi complained to a detective more than 10 years agoabout the reputation of the New Jersey Turnpike's Vince LombardiService Area as a hangout for gay men, Capt. Thomas Gallagher saidFriday.   Mrs. Lombardi, who died in 1982, told the detective she wasdisturbed by the service area's reputation and threatened to haveLombardi's name and football memorabilia removed, the state policespokesman said.   The detective, whom Gallagher would not identify, said thatthere had been many such complaints about the rest station innorthern New Jersey and that ``Mrs. Lombardi complained that it wasgetting all this media attention.''   In response to the protests, then-superintendent Clinton Paganolaunched an undercover operation that led to hundreds of arrestsbetween 1986 and last month.   Officers working on overtime lingered in the men's room in teamsof two, encouraged men to join them in homosexual activity and thenarrested takers on charges of lewd conduct.   The operation was halted last week by Col. Justin Dintino, whomGov. Jim Florio named to replace Pagano. Dintino called theundercover operation ``repulsive.''   ``No matter who started it, what let it continue was policebelieving they could get away with this kind of behavior,'' saidEvan Wolfson, staff attorney for Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a NewYork-based civil rights group that pressured New Jersey officialsto halt the crackdown.   That group and other critics have labeled the operationentrapment inspired by bigotry against a sexual minority.   ``State police should not be preying on vulnerable minorities,let alone wasting valuable resources on such an absurd operation,''Wolfson said.   Pagano, the superintendent for 14 years, was moved to theless-prestigious job of director of the state Division of MotorVehicles.   The exact number of arrests ensuing from the service areacrackdown is unknown, Gallagher said.   The legal defense group has counted 540 arrests between February1988 and October 1989, which covers only a portion of the period inwhich the operation was underway.   Jean Adubato, a turnpike spokeswoman, said she was not aware ofany complaints by the wife of the former Green Bay Packer coach,who coached high school football in Englewood before joining theprofessional ranks.   ``We do not comment on what the state police do. It's strictlyin their hands,'' the spokeswoman said.</TEXT></DOC>
