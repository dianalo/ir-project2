Rather, nuclear power is needed as a growing partner in our national electric generation mix. The U.S. now receives about 20% of its electricity from nuclear power. Our environment would be worse off if that electricity were generated from fossil fuels.    In the future, the U.S. will need more, not less electricity. And nuclear energy will play an important role. Polls and referendums show that even with all the negative publicity nuclear power receives today, more than half the people consistently respond positively toward using more nuclear power in the future. And near operating plants, public acceptance is generally very high, because they know the people who work there.    As for investors, nobody shoves investment opportunities down their throats. Neither utilities nor investors can even consider any new nuclear plants until the current regulatory system is reformed. At that time, investments in nuclear power will be evaluated on their own merits. Regulation must serve the public interest, and not be an invitation for interest groups to manipulate.    A. David Rossin   Los Altos Hills, Calif.    ---   (Mr. Rossin was assistant secretary for nuclear energy, Department of Energy, from 1986 to 1987.) </TEXT></DOC>
