The recommendations, offered by the Electoral Review Committee,mark a step toward political reform in Japan following scandalsthat caused two prime ministers to resign last year. The committeewas set up in June 1989 to lessen the power of money in Japanesepolitics.   The government plans to draw up legislation based on theproposals, but opposition is strong and analysts believe itunlikely the government will adopt the proposals without change.   The report recommended keeping the mixed system of national andregional constituencies used in selecting the 252 delegates to theupper house, but suggested voters be allowed to choose candidatesby name when voting in the national constituencies.   That would decrease the role of parties and increase theimportance of policy in campaigning, the council argued. Critics ofJapan's political system frequently cite lack of substantive policydebate during electioneering.   The report suggested the government provide more money forcandidates to lessen their dependence on outside financing.   It recommended toughening election laws and requiring stricterreporting on the use of political funds.   Kaifu pledged political reform to restore the prestige of hisLiberal Democratic Party and trust in the government. He becameprime minister last August after his two predecessors resigned inquick succession over money and sex scandals.   Earlier proposals from the committee constituted a plan toreshape the more powerful lower house. The panel suggestedreformulating Japan's system of multiple-seat constitutencies tobring greater equality, to reduce politicians' ability to raisemoney on their own and to tighten rules on reporting politicaldonations.</TEXT></DOC>
