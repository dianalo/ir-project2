Then they present, as a new result, the axial anomalyfor simple conformal supergravity. Axial anomalies have been discussedextensively in recent articles. For supergravity, the issue is, as usual,more subtle than elsewhere, because one must fix gauges and add ghostsfor the fermions in the loop. The axial anomal in simple ordinary supergravityhas been calculated by various methods. The authors begin by reobtainingthe same result by means of the original Fujikawa method, since it isinteresting in itself and will be used to illustrate certain aspectsin the conformal computation. The authors show that using as regulatoreither the operator which is obtained directly from the classical actionplus gauge fixing term, or simply the Dirac operator itself, yields thesame result. The authors present the Pauli-Villars computation becauseit most clearly shows which regulator should be used for a given anomaly.</TEXT></DOC>
