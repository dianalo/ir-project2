The nine industrysectors are brass and bronze ingot production (SIC 3341/3362), independentbattery breaking (SIC 5093), lead chemicals (SIC 2816/2819), lead chromatepigments (SIC 2816), leaded steel (SIC 3312/3313), nonferrous foundries(SIC 3362/3369), secondary copper smelting (SIC 3341), shipbuilding andship repair (SIC 3731), and stevedoring (SIC 4463). The determination ismade in response to an order of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit, which remanded the record to OSHA and required OSHAto reconsider the question of feasibility for these industries.Based upon the record, OSHA has determined that the standard is both technologicallyand economically feasible in eight of the nine industry sectors becauseexposure levels above the PEL can be controlled by available and affordableengineering and work practice controls within the time period permittedfor compliance. For some operations within certain industries, it may benecessary for employers to rely on respirators for supplemental protection.For the ninth industry sector, non-ferrous foundries, OSHA has determined50 mg/m\3\ is technologically feasible. With regard to economic feasibility,because the rule could significantly contribute to the withdrawal of overone-half of small foundries and because small foundries constitute about60 percent of the nonferrous foundries, OSHA concludes that achieving 50mg/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controls is economicallyinfeasible for the nonferrous foundry industry. OSHA has not, however,examined whether achieving a PEL above 50 mg/m\3\ but below 200 mg/m\3\by means of engineering and work practice controls is economically feasible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Effective date is August 10, 1989.

Background and Judicial History of the Lead Standard </ITAG>On November 14, 1978, OSHA promulgated the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025),which in part limited occupational exposure to airborne concentrationsof lead to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air (andCx.18;g/m\3\), basedon an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) (43 FR 52952; and 43 FR 54354,November 21, 1978). In paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard, employersin the lead industries were required to achieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PELby means of engineering and work practice controls and various industrieswere given extended time to comply with that obligation. Immediately after promulgation, the lead standard was challenged by bothindustry and labor in several U.S. Courts of Appeals. All cases were transferredto and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit. On August 15, 1980, the United States Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit upheld the validity of OSHA's lead standardin most respects. The court found OSHA's analysis of the feasibility ofthe standard to be adequate and upheld the validity of the entire standardfor the following industry sectors: primary lead smelting, secondary leadsmelting, printing, can manufacturing, battery manufacturing, paint andcoating manufacturing, ink manufacturing, wallpaper manufacturing, electronicmanufacturing and grey-iron foundries. However, the court found that OSHAhad failed to present substantial evidence or adequate reasons to supportthe feasibility of paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard for 38 industrysectors. <T3>United Steelworkers of America </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>453 U.S. 913 (1981). The court did not vacate any portion of the lead standard. Rather, forthe 38 industry sectors, it stayed the enforcement of paragraph (e)(1)of 29 CFR 1910.1025, which requires compliance with the PEL exclusivelyby means of engineering and work practice controls. The court held thatthese industries, however, were immediately required to meet the PEL of50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by some combination of engineering, work practice andrespirator controls. The court also remanded the record to OSHA for reconsiderationof the question of technological and economic feasibility for these industrysectors and gave OSHA six months in which to complete its reassessmentof the feasibility issue. In accordance with the court order, the Agency conducted an expedited rulemaking(45 FR 63476; September 24, 1980). On January 19, 1981, OSHA filed itsresponse to the remand order in which it concluded that attainment of the50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL through use of engineering and work practice controlswas generally feasible in an expanded list of remand industries. A SupplementalStatement of Reasons and Amendment of the Standard containing this conclusionwas published on January 21, 1981 (46 FR 6134). In response to industry petitions for reconsideration, OSHA subsequentlyrequested and was granted a deferral of further court action pending reconsiderationof its January 21, 1981 feasibility findings. Upon reconsideration, OSHAreaffirmed its conclusion that compliance with the PEL was generally feasiblefor most of the remand industries, either because exposure levels did notgenerally exceed the PEL, thus requiring minimal or no compliance actions,or because exposure levels above the PEL could be controlled by availableengineering controls or work practices. A Revised Statement of Reasonscontaining this conclusion was published on December 11, 1981 (46 FR 60758).In this notice, OSHA stated that it could not reach a conclusion regardingfeasibility on the existing record for eight specified industry sectorsand that it also wished to reexamine the applicability of the lead standardfor the stevedoring industry. Therefore, OSHA requested the court on December10, 1981 to remand the record concerning these nine industry sectors forsupplementary administrative proceedings (46 FR 60761). In its December 11, 1981 Revised Statement of Reasons OSHA also amendedthe Lead Standard (29 CFR 1910.1025) in several important respects, oneof which was to exempt employers from the requirement to implement engineeringcontrols for employees who are exposed above the PEL for 30 days or lessannually. In that same document OSHA also included a revised footnote 3in Table I of paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard. That footnote simplymade explicit that the obligation of employers in the lead industries touse engineering and work practice controls to comply with the preexisting200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL was continued, until either the 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\interim PEL or the final 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL for engineering and workpractice controls became effective for a particular industry. That footnotewas inadvertently omitted from succeeding publications of the Code of FederalRegulations. OSHA in this final rule corrects this typographical omissionby republishing footnote 3 as it previously appeared.On March 31, 1987, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitgranted OSHA's request of December 10, 1981 and remanded the record toOSHA for further administrative proceedings to determine the feasibilityof paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard for the nine industry sectorslisted above. The Court ordered OSHA to return the record on or beforeOctober 1, 1987. On June 17, 1987, OSHA filed with the Court a motion requesting a 90-dayextension of time in which to return to the Court the record of the nineremand industry sectors. The Court granted OSHA's unopposed motion. After the March 31, 1987 remand, OSHA contracted with Meridian Research,Inc., a private consulting firm, to collect, develop and update data concerningthe feasibility of compliance with the PEL by means of engineering andwork practice controls in each of the remand industries. The Meridian preliminaryreport was placed into the rulemaking record on August 3, 1987 for publicreview and comment, and OSHA set a September 15, 1987 date for an informalpublic hearing (52 FR 28727; August 3, 1987). In the notice announcingthe hearing OSHA requested interested parties to submit relevant data,including the last two years of air lead monitoring data on an operation-by-operation(job category-by-job category), plant-by-plant basis. OSHA also asked interestedparties to address their comments to 22 specific issues and questions OSHAraised in the notice. On August 18, 1987, OSHA received a request from the Oxide and ChemicalsCommittee of the Lead Industries Association (LIA), the main trade associationfor the lead chemicals industry, that the public hearing and deadline forreceipt of written comments be deferred for at least 30 days, or in thealternative, that the deadline for receipt of written comment be extendedbeyond September 2, 1987. In light of the court order granting OSHA additional time to make feasibilitydeterminations concerning the nine industry sectors and to return the recordto the court, OSHA decided to defer the public hearing and the deadlinefor receipt of written comments for two weeks (52 FR 32312; August 27,1987). Thereafter, on September 8, 1987, the American Cast Metals Association(ACMA) requested a further deferral of the hearing. According to ACMA,the additional time was needed because some important information uponwhich OSHA's contractor, Meridian Research, Inc., based its feasibilityreport was not available in the public docket soon enough for ACMA to evaluateit and to submit meaningful comments by the deadline. ACMA sought a furtherdeferral of the dates for the hearing and the close of comments for approximatelyone or two months. ACMA's request for additional times was immediatelysupported by similar requests from the American Foundrymen's Society, theAssociation of Brass and Bronze Ingot Manufacturers, the American Ironand Steel Institute, and the Plumbing Manufacturing Institute. Thereafter, and without objection from other parties to the rulemaking,OSHA extended the deadline for prehearing comment to October 16, 1987 andthe date for the hearing to November 3, 1987 (52 FR 35731; September 23,1987). OSHA received 111 submissions during the prehearing period and 10late submissions. Twenty-seven persons, including representatives fromeight of the remand industry sectors and two unions, indicated their intentionto appear and testify at the hearing. To supplement the exposure data in the record, on October 27, 1987, OSHAby letter made specific requests to 14 companies in six industry sectorsfor air lead monitoring data job category by job category for 1984-87 (Ex.646). In response, 13 companies submitted the requested data, which wereentered into the record. Thereafter, on November 3, 1987 in Washington, DC, an informal public hearingwas convened by Administrative Law Judge Joan Huddy Rosenzweig pursuantto notice and section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of1970 (29 U.S.C. 655 (b)(3)). At the hearing, representatives from threeindustry sectors (lead chemicals, lead chromate pigments and leaded steel)testified and answered questions. Representatives from five other industries(stevedoring, brass and bronze ingot production, nonferrous foundries,independent battery breaking, and secondary copper) made appearances toquestion OSHA's expert witnesses and contractor, but did not present testimonyor submit to questioning by OSHA or other interested parties. The hearingconcluded on November 6, 1987. During the remand hearing, certain industry participants expressed concernabout the lack of recent plant visits by OSHA or its contractor, Meridian,in preparing the 1987 update of feasibility data. No plant visits had beenconducted by OSHA in the remand industries for the rulemaking since 1981-82.While OSHA considered the existing record sufficient to make a feasibilitydetermination for each of the remand sectors, the Agency agreed that sitevisits and receipt of additional data would be useful. Therefore, in responseto industry's expressed concern, OSHA proposed at the administrative hearingthat it conduct expedited post hearing site visits on a voluntary basisin some of the remand industry sectors (Tr. 1289-90). The purpose of thesite visits was to collect information on manufacturing processes, employment,exposure levels, engineering and work practice controls, and costs andother economic data which would aid OSHA in its determinations of feasibility.In view of OSHA's proposal for site visits and the complexity of the issuesaddressed at the hearing, the administrative law judge ordered that theclosing date for submission of additional post hearing information anddata would be January 8, 1988 and that the closing date for submissionof briefs would be February 5, 1988 (Tr. 1304-05). That order was madecontingent upon the court granting a deferral of its January 1, 1988 deadlinefor return of the record. On November 25, 1987, OSHA requested the courtto extend the deadline for return of the record until July 15, 1988 toallow the Agency time to receive and evaluate more data, to conduct posthearing plant visits and produce site visit reports, and to develop andpublish a final rule. The court granted the motion by its order of December16, 1987, with the provision that OSHA file a status report with the courton or before April 4, 1988, which OSHA did. OSHA received 23 submissionsduring this post hearing comment period. During January and February, 1988, OSHA conducted eight site visits infour industry segments (lead chemicals, lead chromate pigments, nonferrousfoundries and secondary copper). OSHA also tried to arrange site visitsin two other industry sectors, brass and bronze ingot production and leadedsteel, but those industries declined to arrange visits. The site visits were conducted according to agreements executed by OSHAand the plants visited or the relevant trade association. According tothose agreements, the site visit team included OSHA staff, representativesfrom OSHA's contractor, Meridian, and an independent certified industrialhygienist. Also according to the site visit agreements, the name of thefacility visited was kept confidential by OSHA and each plant was giventhe opportunity to review the site visit report for accuracy and tradesecrets before the reports were placed into the docket for public comment.The judge certified the hearing record to the Assistant Secretary on March23, 1988. On April 7, 1988, by <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 1151) OSHA reopened the recorduntil May 9, 1988, for the limited purpose of receiving comments on a finalset of documents OSHA placed into the docket. These documents includedthe eight site visit reports, the final Meridian reports and exposure monitoringdata received in response to the site visits and to OSHA's October 27,1987 request. On April 27, 1988, ACMA requested an extension of the comment period forat least 60 days beyond the May 9 deadline because, ACMA asserted, importantand complex documents were not entered into the docket by OSHA at the timethe record was reopened and the May 9 deadline was insufficient to allowindustry to make meaningful comments. ACMA's request was supported by otherindustry commenters. Thereafter, and without objection from other partiesto the rulemaking, OSHA extended the deadline for public comment to May23, 1988 (53 FR 16731). OSHA received 43 submissions while the record wasreopened and two late submissions (Docket H-004J). On July 15, 1988, OSHA filed with the court a request for an extensionof the deadline from July 15, 1988 to November 30, 1988 for returning theremand record. OSHA requested an extension in part because the Agency hadbeen unable to close the comment period on May 9, 1988 as planned and becausemany comments proved unexpectedly lengthy and complex. On September 7,1988, the court granted OSHA's request and ordered that the Agency filea status report with the court no later than September 30, 1988. OSHA didso. Thereafter, OSHA filed four other motions requesting additional time tocomplete its feasibility determinations and to return the record to thecourt. The first three of these requests for extension of time were grantedwithout objection by the parties to this rulemaking. The Agency's finalmotion for a 90-day extension of time was objected to by the United Steelworkersof America. The court granted OSHA's motion on May 22, 1989. On June 28, 1989, OSHA returned the record to the court and requested thatthe court approve its feasibility findings. OSHA also requested the courtto remand to the Agency the record concerning the nonferrous foundry industryto examine whether achieving a PEL above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ but below 200andCx.18;g/m\3\ is economically feasible for the nonferrous foundry industry.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Feasibility Determinations </ITAG>A. Introduction to Feasibility Assessments <ITAG tagnum="81">Feasibility in General </ITAG>OSHA is obligated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84Stat. 1593; 29 U.S.C. 655, 657) and by court decisions interpreting theAct to protect workers to the extent feasible from significant risks ofmaterial impairment to health. <T3>Industrial Union Department </T3>v. <T3>American Petroleum Institute, </T3>448 U.S. 607 (1980); <T3>Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>838 F.2d 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <T3>United Steel Workers of America </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d 1189. The courts have established the legal criteria for determining economicand technological feasibility. However. the Agency has considerable discretionin applying those criteria. Since OSHA's judgment on feasibility is considereda ``legislative decision,'' the courts will give it ``necessary deference.''The most exhaustive consideration of feasibility and the controlling lawfor this rulemaking is the ``lead decision.'' <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d 1189. <ITAG tagnum="81">Technological Feasibility </ITAG><T3>Introduction. </T3>OSHA concludes that achieving the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL of paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025) by meansof engineering and work practice controls is technologically feasible ineach of the nine industries for which the court in March 1987 remandedthe record to OSHA to pursue further rulemaking. The determination thatit is feasible to achieve the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is based upon reducingemissions from many sources of lead emission and fugitive emissions bya combination of engineering and work practice controls. OSHA makes this determination on the basis of conventional technologiesthat are commonly known, readily available, and, to some degree, currentlyused in the affected industries. These controls generally can reduce exposuresto below the PEL in most operations in each industry. The controls can be used individually or in combination. If one controlis not sufficient, additional ones can be used. If one type of controlis somewhat less effective than expected, another may be more effective.It is the interaction of various engineering controls and work practicesas part of an integrated system of controls that is predicted to resultin the needed overall reduction in exposure levels. OSHA does not specifywhich control must be implemented. Rather, OSHA allows the employer thechoice best suited to the particular characteristics of the workplace.Where feasible engineering and work practice controls cannot achieve thePEL, as in many maintenance and repair operations, intermittent short-termoperations, and tasks performed in confined spaces, respirators are permittedto supplement feasible engineering and work practice controls. For reasons set out below in the Agency's assessment of economic feasibility,OSHA has recognized the need for extended compliance times in these remandindustries. No industry will be required to comply with paragraph (e)(1)of the lead standard in less than two-and-one-half years. This extendedcompliance time gives additional assurance that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ levelis technologically feasible. (a) <T3>OSHA's Approach. </T3>In the following pages OSHA analyzes the technologicalfeasibility of achieving the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL by means of engineeringand work practice controls operation by operation in each of the nine leadindustries included in this remand rulemaking. In that analysis OSHA makesseparate feasibility findings for each industry. OSHA has chosen this analytical approach for several reasons. First, thecourt's reasoning in the lead decision and its resulting remand orders,which control this rulemaking, would seem to require a detailed and separateanalysis for each of the remand industries. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1301. Second, where the evidence clearlysuggests that in important operations achieving the PEL may be difficult,analysis of individual operations would seem to be appropriate to showthe PEL can be achieved in most operations. <T3>Id., </T3>at 1296-97. Third, the level of detail in the record concerningindividual industries confirms the appropriateness of industry-by-industryanalysis in this rulemaking. Finally, conditions in industries as diverseas shipbuilding and lead chemicals, for example, make it better to considersuch industries individually rather than within a single generalized analysis.In each of the nine remand industries OSHA sought to collect the best evidencefor assessing technological feasibility. The Agency hired a contractor,Meridian, to collect data for assessing feasibility and to prepare a preliminaryreport. OSHA then requested relevant data in a notice of limited reopeningof the lead remand rulemaking record (52 FR 28727; August 3, 1987) (Ex.580) and repeated the request with some specificity numerous times duringthe public hearing (e.g., Tr. 385-86, 388-89, 392, 402-03, 1127). In addition,OSHA made written requests for exposure monitoring results to 14 specificfacilities in the remand industries Ex. 646). Finally, OSHA sought to carryout site visits to facilities in six of the nine industries. After gatheringthe data, OSHA then proceeded as follows to assess technological feasibility.First, OSHA briefly describes the production process, operation by operation,and the sources of lead exposure within that process and within the plant.This section also contains background information to make it easier tounderstand the more detailed feasibility analysis that follows. Second, OSHA analyzes the data sets in the record for each industry toassess existing exposure levels operation by operation or job classificationby job classification and, as evidence permits, correlates those exposurelevels with existing engineering controls.OSHA seeks in each industry to rely on the best evidence available in therecord concerning existing and achievable exposure levels. The data setsin each industry are of wide ranging quality. As in most OSHA rulemakings,the record does not contain industrial hygiene or engineering studies thatspecifically evaluate the ability of particular technologies to controlexposures in various operations. Instead, the evidence in the record involvesgeneral descriptions of control technologies and general exposure monitoringdata, which was collected to measure workers' exposures to lead and notto evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls.OSHA's conclusions that these technologies can achieve the PEL are supportedin each remand industry by documented cases of successful implementation,technical analyses incorporating plant-specific exposure data and first-handobservation of plant operations, and expert testimony as to the effectivenessof properly applied engineering design and industrial hygiene principles.Although this data and information certainly is adequate to determine technologicalfeasibility, it requires analysis and judgment to understand and assessthe relationship between exposure levels and control technologies.In assessing the reliability, usefulness and probative value of the datasets in the record and in determining their implications, if any, for thetechnological feasibility of achieving the PEL in a particular industry,OSHA also must exercise its expert judgment. With regard to the nine remandindustries, OSHA feels comfortable with that judgment. OSHA evaluates thedata sets in terms of widely accepted criteria. Using these criteria, OSHAdiscusses and characterizes each of the data sets industry by industryin an effort to identify the best available evidence of exposure levels.OSHA then relies upon the best evidence available for each industry tomake its determinations.Ideally, the best evidence would be a data set that: (1) Was composed ofcomprehensive raw monitoring results over the last several years, includingmonitoring results from tasks associated with higher exposure levels; (2)was gathered by trained personnel; (3) was part of an on-site industrialhygiene evaluation of production processes and existing controls; and (4)was from a facility with typical production processes and state-of-the-artengineering and work practice controls. Such data, accompanied by annotationsdescribing all the relevant conditions under which the sampling was conducted,would provide a most reliable reflection of existing exposure levels andthe firmest basis for determining technological feasibility.However, in none of the nine remand industries does OSHA have data froma facility with state-of-the-art controls. In fact, OSHA has frequentlyfound the application of industrial hygiene principles and effective engineeringdesign to be inadequate throughout these industries. A substantial numberof data sets, thus, appear to be from facilities with poor or no controls.Consequently, existing exposure levels generally are not indicative ofthe levels that an industry can achieve.The next best data set would include recent and comprehensive raw monitoringresults collected by trained personnel at a facility with reasonably typicalproduction processes. It would be accompanied by annotations describingthe relevant conditions under which sampling was conducted. It might besupplemented by an OSHA site visit during which observations by industrialhygienists would associate key production processes with current exposurelevels and existing controls.There are a number of these sorts of data sets available in the record,covering at least four industries (lead chemicals, lead pigments, non-ferrousfoundries and secondary copper smelting). In general, these data sets enableOSHA to assess technological feasibility with considerable assurance.A data set that included neither annotations, descriptions of existingcontrols, nor a site visit would be less useful. There are many such datasets in the record. Typically in this rulemaking, companies submitted datawithout annotations or descriptions of relevant controls. Nevertheless,where it appears from such data sets that 50 mg/m\3\ already is being achievedor is close to being achieved, such data constitute evidence of technologicalfeasibility. However, where it appears that 50 mg/m\3\ is far from beingachieved, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the data because of thelack of contextual information needed to understand why this is so.The least useful sets of monitoring data: (1) Are incomplete or dated;(2) include only summary statistics of sampling results (e.g., only rangesof results or averages, without individual monitoring results), especiallyif they are unaccompanied by an explanation of how they were compiled;(3) aggregate data from a number of plants rather than present data plantby plant; (4) aggregate data across job classifications or operations ratherthan present data operation by operation or job classification by job classification;and (5) include no contextual information concerning the conditions underwhich sampling was conducted, existing controls, and the like.For example, even if a data set in some respects is of reasonably goodquality, if it is composed of data aggregated from a number of plants,it is generally unreliable for determining technological feasibility. Itis unreliable because, to an unknown degree, high monitoring results inone or more plants with poor controls may drastically influence the aggregate.While OSHA seeks to quantify its assessment of technological feasibilityto the extent the data will allow, the data provided by industry are rarelyprecise or clear enough to allow the Agency to make unassailable, statisticallysophisticated determinations. Rather, where appropriate, OSHA uses simplestatistical techniques and supplements these techniques with expert judgment.In the final analysis, as indicated above, OSHA has had to exercise expertjudgment in interpreting and assessing these data. Where the record evidence shows that, in one or more facilities with productionprocesses that are reasonably typical of an industry, exposure levels alreadyhave been controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in most operations mostof the time, that fact is the best evidence that the PEL is technologicallyachievable in the broader industry. Indeed, as the courts have said, ifa PEL has been ``virtually met in one plant * * *, [t]hat in itself canconstitute substantial evidence,'' which would satisfy OSHA's burden ofproving technological feasibility for an industry. <T3>Id., </T3>at 1280. However, even where this is so and still more generally where the recordis not that definitive, OSHA does not simply, or even primarily rely uponexisting exposure levels to prove technological feasibility. OSHA restsits feasibility determination for each industry in large part on the fourthpart of its analysis, which is set out below and focuses on the expectedreductions in existing exposure levels that can be achieved by employersimplementing the sorts of additional controls recommended by OSHA. As a result, the particular method chosen by the Agency to represent theraw exposure data in the Agency's analysis of existing exposure levelsin each industry is not crucial to OSHA's feasibility determination forthat industry. OSHA presents the exposure data in a variety of generallyaccepted ways. For example, OSHA often relies upon the geometric mean (seediscussion below) to characterize the array of monitoring results in individualoperations or job classifications. However, in some industries, OSHA reliesupon the frequency distribution of monitoring results or the arithmeticmean (average) of those results to describe existing exposure levels. In any event, whichever statistic OSHA uses to represent the raw exposuredata for a particular industry, OSHA does not treat the fact that thatstatistic might show that exposures are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ as completeproof by itself of technological feasibility. Rather, the Agency's positionis that such exposure levels generally indicate that controls are in placeto limit excessive employee exposure (or that exposure levels are low tobegin with) and that only relatively modest further additions and improvementsto controls are necessary to reduce the exposure levels of all workersconsistently to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA also does not treat thefact that a statistic that shows exposures in a particular operation arebelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ as complete proof by itself of technological feasibilitybecause OSHA realizes that a geometric mean or any statistic below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\does not by itself guarantee that an employer will be able to achieve 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ at all times under all conditions in that operation. However,based on its knowledge, experience and expertise, OSHA is confident inits assumption that the further a geometric mean is below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\the more likely that most exposure levels in that operation will be below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Third, OSHA describes typical existing controls operation by operationin an industry. Fourth, OSHA recommends the implementation of various additional engineeringand work practice controls for each operation in an industry to reduceemployee exposure levels to or below the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL. When itis able to do so, the Agency also estimates the associated reductions inexposure levels that can be anticipated from implementing such controls.OSHA quantifies the expected reductions where, as in the case of facilitiesto which the Agency has carried out site visits, OSHA feels reasonablyconfident it can numerically estimate the extent of the reductions. OSHA'srecommendations and estimates are based upon analyses by experienced industrialhygienists, frequently industrial hygienists from outside the Agency whowere specifically selected to perform these analyses.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In some of the operations for which the expert panel estimatedreductions in exposure levels that could be anticipated from implementingrecommended controls, the worker's exposure resulted from emissions comingfrom different independent sources or points within that operation. Estimatedreductions in the worker's exposure levels are obtained by eliminating,capturing or in other ways reducing one or more of those contributing,but independent, emission sources. To obtain the overall estimated reductionin the worker's exposure level by controlling every emission source orpoint in the worker's particular operation or job category, the expertpanel utilized the following methodology. The panel first estimated thereductions in emission to the particular operation which could be anticipatedfrom implementing each recommended control. The panel next estimated thepercentage each emission source contributed to the worker's overall TWAexposure level in that operation. The panel then arrived at an estimateof the anticipated reduction in the worker's overall exposure level fromcontrolling the particular emission source by multiplying the estimatedpercentage reduction times the contribution of that emission source tothe worker's overall TWA exposure. Finally, OSHA quantified the overallimpact of implementing the various recommended controls for a particularoperation by adding the weighted contribution of each control to determinethe worker's total anticipated reduction in exposure due to controllingthe independent emission sources in that operation. OSHA notes that inthose situations in which the impact of the controls may be dependent uponeach other, OSHA would multiply the reductions anticipated from each ofthe different recommended controls.OSHA's main approach in this additional controls section of the preambleis to concentrate first on the operations that industry itself has identifiedas the most difficult to control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Although the Agencydoes not limit its analysis of additional controls to these operations,OSHA concludes that, if it can show that exposure levels can be controlledto or very near the PEL in those operations, controlling other operationsto the PEL should be relatively easy. The controls OSHA recommends arenot mandatory. OSHA's lead standard does not require employers to institutespecific controls. OSHA intentionally drafted the standard in performancelanguage in order to permit employers the latitude to develop the combinationof engineering and work practice controls suited to particular facilities.The list of recommended controls also is not exhaustive. OSHA fully expectsthat industry and its consultants will devise many additional ways to successfullycontrol exposure levels. The recommended controls also are not intended as a blueprint or infallibleguide to be implemented in every facility in an industry. On the contrary,as a fundamental part of the Agency's recommended control strategy, OSHAurges that each plant that needs to reduce exposure levels conduct itsown plant-wide industrial hygiene survey and job/task analysis to determinethe particular sources of emission, their contribution to employee exposures,and the proper mix of controls needed to deal with the specific exposureproblems found in that plant. OSHA also suggests that followup industrialhygiene studies be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of whatevercontrols are implemented and to refine the controls in place in accordancewith the results of sampling performed after the controls were implemented.Hence, in industries where OSHA finds the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL to be technologicallyfeasible, the recommended controls are simply illustrative of effective,conventional ways to achieve the PEL. As such, they provide a reasonablebasis for assessing technological feasibility and for estimating costsof compliance and assessing economic feasibility. Fifth, OSHA then makes its determination concerning the technological feasibilityof achieving the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL by means of engineering and workpractice controls in the particular industry. In reaching this decision,OSHA summarizes and responds to an industry's main criticisms and mainarguments. For example, many representatives of industry asserted in their commentsthat currently available engineering and work practice controls are notcapable of achieving the PEL. However, as indicated earlier, OSHA foundthat often these representatives did not appreciate, and in their facilitiesdid not demonstrate a basic understanding of, the principles of industrialhygiene so necessary to assess and control employee exposures to lead.As a consequence, these industry assertions of technological infeasibilitycannot be accepted at face value. (b) <T3>Data Analysis. </T3>In order to make use of the exposure data in therecord to assess technological feasibility, OSHA had to select statisticalapproaches that would best describe the data in each case. OSHA recognizesthat there is no single statistic that can fully describe a set of exposuredata, and the statistics one chooses depend in part upon how the data areto be used. For example, a range of exposure levels (e.g., from 8 andCx.18;g/m\3\to 579 andCx.18;g/m\3\) provides very little useful information about typicalexposure levels. Similarly, an arithmetic mean, which is equivalent to the commonly used``average,'' provides little insight into the distribution of exposuresand is subject to gross distortion by outlying numbers. The arithmeticmean is equal to the sum of all the sampling results divided by the numberof results. The arithmetic mean is a good way to characterize a set ofdata where the individual data points follow a normal distribution, thatis, where the distribution of points above and below the mean is symmetricaland can be charactrized by a bell-shaped curve. Then, the arithmetic meanis the same as the median (i.e., the point above and below which 50% ofthe sampling results fall). The reason the arithmetic mean, which is often used in everyday life, isnot the best method for representing and evaluating exposure measurementsis that exposure measurements typically are asymetrically distributed andfollow a log normal distribution. Where data are distributed lognormally,the arithmetic mean is always greater than the median of the sampling data.With such data, it is generally accepted that the geometric mean is thebest single statistic to characterize the data set (``Occupational ExposureSampling Strategy Manual,'' Leidel, <T3>et al., </T3>NIOSH, 1977; Exs. 686A. pp. 12-13; 694-6, p. 2; 694-9,Comments by Company B. pp. 15, 21). (The differences between a ``normal''distribution and a ``lognormal'' distribution are explained with clarityin that same publication, particularly in Technical Appendix M.) With exposure data, the lower exposures are bounded by the limit of detectionor zero but the higher exposures are virtually unbounded. This typicallyresults in many exposures being relatively close to zero with a few veryhigh measurements. Thus, the distribution typically is skewed to the lowend and has a long flat ``tail'' on the high side. When the actual dataare depicted graphically, lognormal distributions generally peak to theleft of the median and have a long ``tail'' to the right. Atypical observationson the high side fall in the ``tail'' area of the lognormal distribution.If the sampling results from a lognormal distribution are assigned theirlogarithmic values, they can be plotted as a normal distribution, and theexponent of their average will be the geometric mean. The geometric meanappears to give less weight to, or to discount the few high monitoringresults reflected by that tail.The geometric mean exposure of a group of lognormally distributed exposuresrepresents the median exposure, just as the arithmetic mean representsthe median exposure in a normal distribution. Consequently, the use ofan arithmetic mean for samples that are lognormally distributed does notadequately describe the data. In such cases, the arithmetic mean will behigher than the median so that mean will always be higher than the ``typical''exposure. In addition to using geometric means, OSHA also looked at the frequencydistribution of data points to assess the dispersion of the data. OSHAbelieves that the use of the frequency distribution in combination withthe geometric mean provides an especially stong basis for making informedfeasibility determinations. For example, in operations where the vast majorityof sampling results already is below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and the geometricmean already is at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA believes there is enoughindication that the spread of exposure levels above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ isquite limited for the Agency to conclude that implementing a few additionalcontrols is likely to consistently control exposure levels in those operationsto below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. When information on the record was available, OSHA quantified reductionsin exposure levels that could be anticipated from implementing engineeringand work practice controls recommended by the expert panel of certifiedindustrial hygienists. As described above, in several cases the geometricmean was one of the methods used to describe worker exposure levels whereraw monitoring data on an operation by operation basis were available.However, in many of those cases the exposure data were poorly characterizedor not characterized at all so that OSHA was not able to determine whysome measurements for the same operation were high and some were low. Forexample, the data from Company B in the lead chemicals industry did notprovide any information on the conditions which may have existed when anmonitoring result of 427 andCx.18;g/m\3\ was obtained for the shipper in1986, even though all other monitoring results for that operation duringthat year were below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Because of the lack of specific information explaining why monitoring resultswere high or low, OSHA applied the estimated reduction in exposure levelsdue to implementing the recommended controls to the geometric mean foreach operation. OSHA recognizes that reductions in exposure levels willnot be the same for all measurements, however, industry has not providedthe necessary infomration to show how reductions will vary for the differentmonitoring results obtained for each operation. OSHA believes that applyingthe reduction to the geometric mean is a reasonable method for interpretingthe data. In any event, OSHA would have reached the same adjusted geometricmean had the estimated reduction been applied to each raw monitoring resultand then a new geometric mean been recalculated. OSHA's contractor, Meridian, applied the reductions to the geometric meanin the same way by using the following methodology (e.g., Ex. 686A, p.19). First, any reduction in exposure assigned by the expert panel of certified,experienced industrial hygienists to a specific job category or workerwas applied to the geometric mean exposure for that job category or worker,and the new geometric mean was calculated. Because the panel generallyassigned a range to the expected exposure reduction, the resulting geometricmean exposure was expressed as a range and as the midpoint of that range.After all specific exposure reductions were calculated, any general exposurereduction (e.g., reductions applying either to the facility or work areaas a shole) was applied to each affected worker's geometric mean exposure,after which a new geometric mean was calculated. As to OSHA's reliance on particular statistical methodologies, the Agencyis assured that it could have relied on other methodologies and that, onceit adjusted the data to better reflect real, underlying conditions, itwould have reached the same technological feasibility determinations. (c) <T3>Technological Feasibility, Exposure Variability, and Enforcement. </T3>Undersection 6(b)(5) of the OSH Act, the Agency is to set standards that ``tothe extent feasible'' best protect workers from significant risks of materialimpairment of health. 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(3); <T3>American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Donovan, </T3>452 U.S. 490 (1981); <T3>Industrial Union Department, </T3>448 U.S. at 607; <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1189. OSHA does not believe that it cansatisfy this obligation by using a lowest-common-denominator approach toprotecting workers; i.e., by protecting all workers only to the extentthat the most severe feasibility constraint on protecting any worker wouldallow. On the contrary, OSHA believes that if a minority of workers cannotbe as effectively protected as the majority, that fact is not an adequatereason to forego protecting the majority to the extent feasible. OSHA has developed this understanding of technological feasibility as amatter of policy from recent court decisions. The meaning of feasibilityis most thoroughly analyzed in <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1189, which is the law of the case for thisrulemaking. That analysis is adopted and further developed in a very recentdecision concerning the asbestos standard, <T3>Bldg and Construction Trades Dept., AFL-CIO, </T3>838 F.2d at 1258.Under the OSH Act, which has been interpreted by the courts to be ``technology-forcing,''OSHA is ``not bound to the technological status quo.'' OSHA ``at the veryleast, can impose a standard which only the most technologically advancedplants in an industry have been able to achieve_even if only in some oftheir operations some of the time. * * * OSHA can also force industry todevelop and diffuse new technology. * * * So long as * * * [OSHA] presentssubstantial evidence that companies acting vigorously and in good faithcan develop the technology, OSHA can require industry to meet PEL's neverattained anywhere.'' <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1264-65. In proving technological feasibility, OSHA is not required by the courtsto provide ``anything like certainty. * * * [A] standard is obviously notinfeasible solely because OSHA has no hard evidence to show that the standardhas been met.'' The courts ``cannot require OSHA to prove with any certaintythat industry will be able to develop the necessary technology, or evento identify the single technological means by which it expects industryto meet the PEL. * * * OSHA's duty is to show that modern technology hasat least conceived some industrial strategies or devices which are likelyto be capable of meeting the PEL and which the industries are generallycapable of adopting.'' <T3>Id., </T3>at 1266. With such broad authority, OSHA must bear ``the initial burden of provingthe general feasibility of the standard for the industry as a whole atthe rulemaking stage * * *. This proof creates a presumption of generalfeasibility, which shifts ``to the employer in later proceedings the taskof overcoming OSHA's initial finding.'' ``[S]ince the presumption of feasibilityremains rebuttable, in pre-enforcement review the court would not expectOSHA to prove the standard <T3>certainly </T3>feasible for <T3>all </T3>firms at <T3>all </T3>times in <T3>all </T3>jobs'' (italics in original). Rather, OSHA ``would have tojustify the presumption, and the attendant shift in burden, with reasonbletechnological * * * evidence and analysis.'' <T3>Id., </T3>at 1270. Describing this preliminary test of general feasibility that an OSHA standardmust pass in a pre-enforcement review, the court sums up OSHA's burdenof proof as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">First, within the limits of the best available evidence, and subjectto the court's search for substantial evidence, OSHA must prove a reasonablepossibility that the typical firm will be able to develop and install engineeringand work practice controls that can meet the PEL in most of its operations.OSHA can do so by pointing to technology that is either already in useor has been conceived and is reasonably capable of experimental refinementand distribution within the standard's deadlines. The effect of such proofis to establish a presumption that industry can meet the PEL without relyingon respirators, a presumption which firms will have to overcome to obtainrelief in any secondary inquiry into feasibility * * *. Insufficient proofof technological feasibility for a few isolated operations within an industry,or even OSHA's concession that respirators will be necessary in a few suchoperations, will not undermine this general presumption in favor of feasibility.Rather, in such operations firms will remain responsible for installingengineering and work practice controls to the extent feasible, and forusing them to reduce lead exposure as far as these controls can do so.In any proceeding to obtain relief from an impractical standard for suchoperations, however, the insufficient proof or conceded lack of proof will<T3>reduce </T3>the strength of the presumption a firm will have to overcomein justifying its use of respirators (italics in original) * * *. Sucha standard of review for feasibility, of course, in no way ensures thatall companies at all times and in all jobs can meet OSHA's demands * **. <T3>Id., </T3>at 1272.</ITAG>With this understanding of feasibility, two related questions arise. First,how does a certain amount of random variability in exposure levels affectan assessment that a particular PEL is technologically feasible? Second,is it appropriate for OSHA to find a PEL technologically feasible whenit is understood that: (1) That finding does not mean or assure that thePEL is achievable all of the time in all operations; (2) that some randomvariability in exposure levels is to be anticipated; and (3) that exposurelevels in a facility may on a particular day therefore be in excess ofthe PEL expressed as an 8-hour TWA, potentially subjecting the employerto some risk of citation? As to the first question, OSHA recognizes that some random fluctuationof exposure levels around an average does exist. Depending upon minor changesin operations or the environment, such as weather, process flow and employeework practices, which may not be fully controllable by the employer, oncertain days exposures will be higher, and on others they will be lowerthan the average. Due to such random variability, employers may want togenerally control exposure levels to an average somewhat below the PELto ensure that random variations above that average will not exceed thelimit. However, not all variability is truly random or outside employers' control.For example, many high exposures are the result of identifiable and controllablecauses, such as inadequate or poorly maintained engineering controls, improperwork practices, or lack of oversight by qualified industrial hygienists.Many companies recognize that such exposures are not random and recordinformation on operational and environmental conditions prevailing at thetime of sampling to explain sampling results (Exs. 688a; 688c). Many companiesalso concentrate their hygiene efforts on the conditions associated withthe highest exposures. OSHA is confident that correcting deficiencies incontrols not only will broadly reduce existing exposure levels but alsowill substantially reduce variability. After carefully considering the impact of truly random variability on theissue of technological feasibility in this rulemaking, OSHA has concludedthat the variability that remains outside the employers' control afterthe employer has implemented all appropriate controls does not make compliancewith the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL technologically infeasible. Control techniquesare readily available in most operations to keep average exposures sufficientlybelow the PEL to ensure that remaining variations will result in very fewrandom exposures above the PEL. The second question concerns the implications of such a determination oftechnological feasibility for enforcement. It is a fundamental principleof OSHA Act law that the Act does not impose strict liability; its purposeis preventive rather than punitive or compensatory, and the duties it imposesmust therefore be achievable. See, e.g., <T3>National Realty and Construction </T3>v. <T3>OSHRC, </T3>489 F.2d 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1973). OSHA understands that determiningtechnological feasibility in part on the basis of statistical probabilitiesmay mean that, while an industry generally can achieve compliance witha permissible exposure limit, some employers, in some operations, someof the time will not in fact be able to do so. At such times, these employersmay be vulnerable to citation. In fulfilling its statutory duty to protect workers, the Agency wishesto avoid unfairness to employers. Thus, in recognition of the existenceof certain variables that the employer cannot completely control, suchas occasional, random outliers in monitoring results, OSHA has built someflexibility into its longstanding enforcement policy to prevent citationsfrom being issued when such events occur. This flexibility means that employersneed not control average exposures to so far below the PEL that there remainsonly a negligible probability that an exposure measurement on any particularday will exceed the PEL. For example, since, due to sampling and analytical error (SAE), monitoringresults may not reflect ``true'' employee exposures, OSHA has explicitlystated that it will not issue a citation on the basis of a single OSHAsample result unless that result exceeds the PEL plus the SAE (currentlydetermined to be 12% in the case of lead). Consequently, a citation forexceeding the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL will not be issued unless the resultof a lead sample is greater than 56 andCx.18;g/m\3\. This policy in practicemay also provide some latitude for random variability. In addition, OSHA specifically takes account of uncontrollable random variabilityin its enforcement policy. The OSHA Industrial Hygiene Technical Manual(p. 10-7/ IV-4), directs compliance officers to consider long-term, historicalexposure patterns in reaching compliance determinations. Consequently,if a compliance officer finds an exposure over the PEL for an employee,and the employer has many measurements for that employee that are underthe PEL, the compliance officer will investigate the problem. If the investigationreveals that the compliance officer's sample may not be a true representationof the employee's exposure, the compliance officer may decide to remonitor.OSHA generally will not cite for a violation of the PEL if the employershows that the inspector's measurement is unrepresentatively high and thatthe employer has been taking all feasible steps to meet the PEL. (51 FR22653-54). OSHA has been following this approach to enforcement since its inception.In OSHA's experience, this approach has proven to be protective, fair,and efficient. It has been protective of workers. It also has been fairto employers, because it has provided reasonable certainty to employerswho, after installing appropriate controls, have consistently achievedthe mandated levels. Finally, the approach has been reasonably efficientin terms of the compliance officer's time. OSHA's approach to enforcement has been upheld by the courts. In a recentdecision in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit, the court explicitly addressed the interrelationship between OSHA'senforcement policy, technological feasibility, and random uncontrollablevariability in exposure levels. In upholding OSHA's policy, the court said,``if OSHA is permitted to adopt a standard that some employers assuredlywill not be able to meet some of the time, with the employers limited tochallenging feasibility at the enforcement stage, * * * it is difficultto find legal objection in an OSHA enforcement policy that attempts totake account of particular feasibility difficulties at the pre-citationstage.'' <T3>Building and Construction Trades Dept., AFL-CIO, </T3>838 F.2d at 1268.<ITAG tagnum="81">Economic Feasibility</ITAG><T3>Introduction.</T3> In this section, OSHA explains its interpretationof economic feasibility and presents its general assessment of the abilityof these nine remand industry sectors to finance the costs 50 mg/m\3\ standardfor occupational exposure to airborne lead.The criteria for determining economic feasibility are provided in the ``leaddecision.'' There, the court said:<ITAG tagnum="21">``A standard is not infeasible simply because it is financially burdensome(citation omitted) or even because it threatens the survival of some companieswithin an industry * * * A standard is feasible if it does not threaten`massive dislocation' * * * No matter how initially frightening the projected* * * costs of compliance appear, a court must examine those costs in relationto the financial health and profitability of the industry and the likelyeffect of such costs on unit consumer prices * * * [T]he practical questionis whether the standard threatens the competitive stability of an industry(citation omitted) or whether * * * the standard might wreck such stabilityor lead to undue concentration. * * * [To demonstrate economic feasibility,]OSHA must construct a reasonable likelihood that these costs will not threatenthe existence or competitive structure of an industry, even if it doesportend disaster for some marginal firms.''<T3> USWA</T3> v.<T3> Marshall,</T3> 647 F.2d 1189.</ITAG>Thus, the fact that compliance costs could be burdensome to an industryor that some firms could go out of business because of these costs doesnot mean a standard is economically infeasible. The issue is not whetherthe standard creates economic hardship for specific firms in an industryor even for the industry as a whole. For a standard to be economicallyinfeasible the courts require more. A standard is economically infeasiblewhen the costs imposed are so overwhelming that they create ``massive dislocation''of the industry, threaten the ``existence'' or ``competitive stability''of the industry, or lead to ``undue concentration'' within the industry.<T3>USWA </T3>v.<T3> Marshall,</T3> 647 F.2d 1189.OSHA believes that it must base its determination of economic feasibilityupon substantial evidence that an industry sector is not threatened withmassive dislocation attributable to the cost of complying with the standardat the time compliance deadlines arrive. In order to make this judgment,projected capital or annual costs of compliance must be examined in relationto the financial health and profitability of an industry sector and thelikely effect of such costs on prices. A standard is economically feasibleif costs can be passed on in price increases and/or absorbed by firms,and any necessary absorption of costs will not threaten the competitivestability of the industry.OSHA interprets economic feasibility as the ability of an industry as awhole to withstand the cost impacts of a rule, even though some firms coulddiscontinue operations. If, for example, an industry is in a period ofreconstruction or contraction due to prevailing economic conditions, thefact that a rulemaking could accelerate such trends does not in itselfmake the standard economically infeasible.OSHA has found substantial evidence to support its determinations for eachof the nine remand industries. While much of industry was largely unresponsiveto repeated requests for plant specific financial data, an abundance ofinformation outlining general economic trends encompassing the affectedindustries exists in the public record and in the public domain.Financial and price information were submitted by some firms. OSHA usedthis information, in conjunction with economic data gathered by its contractoras well as data available from other public sources, to develop representativefinancial profiles.Cost estimates were prepared by OSHA's contractor and were submitted tothe docket for public comment during a written comment period. Also, OSHA'scontractor was cross-examined during the informal public hearing. Manycommenters submitted useful comments and the final cost estimates representthe combined efforts of OSHA's contractors, industry personnel and associations,and OSHA staff.Costs and financial data were then used to develop impact ratios. Theseratios provided quantitative estimates of the possible impacts of thisregulation on prices and industry profitability.Assessments of economic feasibility were not, however, based solely uponthese quantitative impact estimates. In many cases, information was availablewhich provided the Agency with a means to qualitatively assess an industry'sability to withstand the impacts of the rule. Such information includedevidence of modernization and/or new construction, evidence of the abilityof certain plants to shift away from lead-related products, thus avoidingcompliance costs altogether, and evidence of the ability of certain plantsto attain the 50 mg/m\3\ PEL with limited or negligible expenditures.Thus, quantitative estimates and qualitative information were analyzedwithin the context of each respective industry's market structure and currentstatus to determine economic feasibility.The results of this analysis led OSHA to conclude that an extended fiveyear compliance schedule is justified for secondary copper smelting, brassand bronze ingot manufacture, and lead chemicals. A two and one-half yearschedule will be in effect for stevedoring, shipbuilding and repair, independentbattery breaking, leaded steel, and lead chromate pigments. For reasonsdetailed elsewhere in this preamble, OSHA concluded that the 50 mg/m\3\PEL is economically infeasible for the nonferrous foundry industry.The extended compliance schedule was required in three industry sectorsprincipally to permit modernization and construction to continue and toallow firms to phase in engineering controls. The unique cost impact relatedto lowering permissible exposure levels to lead by means of engineeringand work practice controls is not expected to significantly alter restructuringactivities which are in response to prevailing economic conditions. OSHAbelieves that the objectives sought by the 50 mg/m\3\ standard are consistentwith such restructuring in that modernization is often accomplished withproduction technology which inherently reduces worker exposure.In general, with the five year extended schedule granted to the three sectorsmentioned above, evidence demonstrates that most plants in these sectorswill not experience undue burden as a result of this rulemaking action.Nevertheless, OSHA recognizes that this regulation could accelerate thephasing out of certain less efficient facilities and that some marginalfirms could decide at least in part to discontinue operations as a resultof this standard.Thus, based on the evidence in the record and the analysis below, OSHAhas determined that the 50 mg/m\3\ lead standard is economically feasiblefor eight of the nine remand industries considered.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Feasibility of the Lead Standard in Each of the Nine Remand IndustrySectors </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Brass and Bronze Ingot Production </ITAG><T3>Process Description. </T3>Brass and bronze ingot production involvesrefining copper-based alloy scrap, which is melted, adjusted to achieveparticular alloy specifications, and poured into molds to form ingots.Most of the lead originates in the scrap, with lead added at times to bringa particular melt to desired alloy specifications (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-1).Raw materials used by brass and bronze ingot producers include a wide varietyof copper-bearing scrap, such as faucets, automotive radiators, electricalcable and machinings (Ex. 574, p. 1). Typically, the lead content of thescrap varies. The lead content of the most common types of ingots producedis 5-7% (e.g., leaded red brass and semi-red brass; Ex. 574, p. 2). Insome brass and bronze ingot producing facilities, no more than 20% of totaltonnage is in high lead alloys (25% lead), which means that 80% of theirtonnage is comprised of low-lead or unleaded alloys (Ex. 582-89, pp. 34-35).The main operations in ingot production are scrap preparation; furnaceoperations, which include charging, melting, slagging (also called drossingand skimming), tapping and sometimes pouring; pouring molten metal intomolds; and ingot handling. <T3>Scrap Preparation. </T3>Scrap preparation may involve receiving, sorting,cleaning, cutting, preheating and storing copper-based scrap (Ex. 574,p. 1). Scrap is received by truck and rail in car load quantities from scrap dealers.Scrap is received loose (e.g., tubing from radiator plants), in bulky pieces(e.g., used radiators), and in compressed blocks. Loose scrap is sortedand organized in bins according to metallic composition. Some scrap isprocessed to facilitate handling and charging. For example, bulky scrap(e.g., automotive radiators) may be reduced in size by briquetters or balers.Bulk quantities of borings and drilling scrap are reduced through crushersand hammermills. If pieces of scrap are too large to handle easily (e.g.,ship propellers), they may be cut (Exs. 553-4, p. 1-1; 694-11, p. 9). In some cases the scrap is also cleaned (e.g., sweated or stripped) toremove oil, paint, lead solder, or plastic wire coating (Ex. 574, p. 1).Rotary dryers also may be used to remove other unwanted contaminants (Ex.568, p. 116). Processed scrap also may be passed through a magnetic separatorto remove ferrous metals before it is fed into the furnace (Ex. 568, p.47). If scrap is wet, because, for example, it has been stored outdoorsor because it has been moistened to suppress dust, it must be preheatedbefore being charged to the furnace. <T3>Furnace Operation. </T3>The primary function of the furnace is to meltthe scrap charged into it. Furnace operations involve the following tasks:charging, melting, slagging, tapping, sometimes pouring, and transferringmolten metal. Furnaces can be of various types. The most commonly used furnaces in ingotproduction are directly-fired reverbatory furnaces, which are charged withhigh-grade copper scrap, and rotary furnaces. OSHA understands that someingot producers may use reverbatory furnaces primarily for refining themelt, relying on rotary furnaces to produce the particular alloy. Smallcrucible or electric-fired furnaces are also used sometimes (Ex. 553-4,pp. 1-1 to 1-2). Charging is done by skip hoists, forklift trucks, or electrically poweredvehicles. Reverberatory and rotary furnaces are charged from above, whilein other furnaces the charge is added through a side door (Ex. 607, pp.1-2). Where scrap is top-charged, employees perform the work on groundlevel, using a monorail skip hoist and tote-bin material-handling system(Ex. 568, p. 236). Fuels are fired directly into the charged furnace to melt the scrap. Whenthe furnace reaches melt temperature, fluxes are added to reduce impurities.These impurities combine to form slag, which rises to the surface of themelt (Ex. 607, p. 2). During slagging the furnace is rotated approximately90 degrees so that the charging door is positioned at the side of the furnace.Slag is then skimmed off from the charging door into an uncovered slagladle (Ex. 568, p. 236). Filled slag ladles are transported from the furnacearea by forklift trucks. When necessary, certain metals are then added to bring the melt to desiredalloy specifications. A furnace grab sample of the melt is taken and analyzedto monitor metal composition before the melt is tapped (Ex. 553-4, pp.1-1 to 1-2). When the molten alloy is ready, the molten metal may be tappedinto a ladle or into a trough known as a launder, which leads to a ladleat the casting line (Ex. 568, p. 239). In some cases, the molten alloyis poured directly from the furnace into ingot molds (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-2).<T3>Pouring and Casting. </T3>After the molten alloy is tapped and transferredto the pouring area, it is poured into ingot molds. Most facilities useautomatic casting methods. For example, with a casting carousel, the operatorpours the molten metal into empty molds that rotate into place under thepouring ladle (Ex. 574, p. 20). Some ingot producers do not use automaticcasting but instead continue to use manual pouring, which is associatedwith higher lead exposures for pourers (Ex. 582-85, p. 31). Generally,the alloy is cast into sixty-pound ingots. <T3>Ingot Handling. </T3>The ingots are cooled, separated from their molds,and mechanically stacked onto pallets that are moved by forklift truckinto the product warehouse until delivery. Some facilities cool ingotsusing water-cooling methods (Ex. 568, p. 51). <T3>Sources of Exposure. </T3>The main sources of lead exposure in ingotproduction are dust emitted during briquetting of scrap and fume emittedduring charging of the furnace, tapping, slagging and pouring. A lessersource of lead exposure is dust generated during scrap preparation. OSHAbelieves that cross contamination from primary sources of lead emissionsmay also be a source of higher exposure levels elsewhere in ingot production.OSHA does not believe that ingot handling itself provides a significantsource of lead exposure. Sometimes charging may be a source of high exposure when upsets occur.For example, when scrap fed into the furnace is hung up in the tote binas it is dumped or is caught in the throat of the charging hopper, a workermay have to climb to the charging deck to dislodge the jam. At these times,the worker may be exposed to high lead exposures from dust and fumes escapingfrom the charging port.<T3>Employee Exposures_Overview.</T3> An overview of existing exposurelevels reveals the following. As far back as 1979-81, nearly three-quarters(74%) of all employees in ingot production were reported by OSHA's contractor,JACA, to be exposed at levels below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-3). Moreover,in three of the four plants for which JACA reported employee exposure levels,nearly two-thirds or more of all employees were exposed below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 583-48).Data from recent OSHA inspections show that 55% of all exposures are below50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 574, p. 2). These data thus corroborate JACA's findingson exposure levels in this sector.<T3>The Data. </T3>The preceding overview and following analysis of exposurelevels is based upon the best available evidence in the record. The recordincludes four primary data sets: data collected from ingot producers byOSHA's previous contractor. JACA (Exs. 553-4 and 583-48); data submittedby the Association of Brass and Bronze Ingot Manufacturers (``ABBIM'')(Ex. 665); data from OSHA inspections (Ex. 574, p. 2); and data submittedby the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) andRadian (Exs. 567; 568; 583-16). These data sets tend to be incomplete regardingexposure data and associated control information but they do provide sufficientinformation to allow OSHA to assess technological feasibility.For several reasons, the data set provided by ABBIM (Ex. 665) appears tobe less useful than other data sets. The data set is upwardly biased, inpart because ABBIM has only provided sampling results from operations generallyconsidered to have higher exposure levels. Thus, for example, data areprovided concerning pourers and briquetters, but no data are provided forscrap sorters or ingot handlers. Such data cannot therefore be taken asrepresentative of exposure levels throughout the industry. In addition,sampling results from the furnace and pouring areas at Company A are mixedtogether as ``melting and pouring operations'' (Ex. 665), so OSHA cannotascertain exposure levels in either of the individual operations.As indicated, the ABBIM data set (Ex. 665) also is incomplete. With regardto Company B, for example, ABBIM provided data only from one undated ``inspection,''rather than providing, as OSHA requested, the more extensive air monitoringdata that are required under the lead standard to be collected on a quarterlybasis.Finally, the ABBIM data generally are not accompanied by information concerningunderlying conditions, processes or controls. ABBIM provides almost nodescription of associated controls operation by operation. Consequently,the ABBIM data provide little information with which to perform the operation-by-operationanalysis useful for determining whether it is feasible to achieve 50 mg/m\3\in most operations most of the time. Without such information about existingcontrols, OSHA cannot conclude simply from high sampling results that controllingto 50 mg/m\3\ is infeasible. The mere fact that in operations like pouringexposure levels are high when the operations may be uncontrolled or poorlycontrolled says little about the feasibility of controlling to 50 mg/m\3\.For all of these reasons, OSHA considers the data submitted by ABBIM ofvery limited use in determining technological feasibility.By contrast, the JACA data (Ex. 553-4) show that by 1979-81 a number ofbrass and bronze ingot producers already were achieving exposure levelsbelow 50 mg/m\3\ most of the time, whatever the controls being implemented.The fact that existing controls also are not adequately described operationby operation in the JACA report is much less a limiting factor than itis for the ABBIM data. Where air lead levels of 50 mg/m\3\ have alreadybeen achieved, it is not so critical to OSHA's determination of technolgicalfeasibility that the Agency know precisely which of the array of conventionalcontrols were implemented. On the other hand, where 50 mg/m\3\ is not beingachieved, it is crucial for purposes of determining technological feasibilitythat the Agency know the state of existing controls.In addition, where 50 mg/m\3\ is being achieved, that fact by itself constitutesthe best available evidence of technological feasibility. Only a showingthat plants achieving 50 mg/m\3\ are not representative of the rest ofthe industry could refute such evidence. In this case, ABBIM and othercommenters for industry have made no such allegation concerning the JACAdata. On the contrary, industry representatives repeatedly cite JACA favorably,suggesting that JACA's data are indeed representative of the rest of theindustry (Exs. 694-10, p. 2; 694-11, p. 3; 694-39, pp. 13-14).Specifically concerning the JACA data (Exs. 553-4, pp. 1-2 to 1-3; 583-48),OSHA believes for a number of reasons that they are reliable and useablein determining technological feasibility in this sector. First, the JACAdata were supplied by ingot producers and include sampling results as wellas distributions of air lead levels across their workforces. Second, theJACA data include the years 1977 to 1981. Since then production levelshave fallen and some additional controls have been implemented. Therefore,OSHA considers these data likely to be conservative estimates of currentexposure levels.The final data set was generated by OSHA inspections in 1984-87 of fivebrass and bronze ingot producers (Ex. 574, p. 4), a number constitutingnearly one-third of all current producers. OSHA believes these data tobe conservative as well, since OSHA inspectors tend to sample operationswhere they anticipate high exposure levels. Moreover, inspection data includeresults from plants OSHA inspects in response to employee complaints. Suchplants tend to have relatively high air lead levels. In any event, therecent OSHA inspection data confirm OSHA's findings that 50 mg/m\3\ alreadyhas been and continues to be achieved in ingot production.Looking more closely at the JACA data, in which 74% of employees are exposedbelow 50 mg/m\3\, OSHA notes the following. Nearly one-half (44%) of allemployees were exposed below 30 mg/m\3\, the action level of the lead standard.Thus, nearly twice as many employees were exposed below 30  mg/m\3\ aswere exposed above 50 mg/m\3\ (26%) (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-4).In addition, as indicated above, in three of the four plants for whichJACA reported employee exposure data nearly two-thirds or more of all employeeswere exposed below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 583-48). For example, at Plant K exposurelevels were below 50 mg/m\3\ in all operations except the baghouse, a maintenanceoperation. At Plant K, where 94% of the 68 employees were exposed below50 mg/m\3\ in 1981, the company reported that typical 8-hour time-weightedaverages (``TWAs'') for foundry workers were between 30-50 mg/m\3\. Forall other workers typical TWAs were below 30 mg/m\3\, except for the baghouse.Typical exposure levels in the baghouse, which OSHA considers essentiallya maintenance operation, were said to be between 100-150 mg/m\3\, but theonly actual sampling results provided for baghouse attendants indicateaverage TWA exposure levels of 75 mg/m\3\ in 1981 (Ex. 583-48, Plant K,p. 3).Similarly, at plants M and N, 65% and 85% of employees were exposed below50 mg/m\3\, respectively. At the fourth plant, Plant L, which inexplicablyhad higher exposure levels, 22% of employees were exposed below 50 mg/m\3\,and one-half of the employees were exposed between 100-150 mg/m\3\ (Ex.583-48, Plant L, p. 1). For all of the brass and bronze ingot workers surveyedby JACA in 1981, fully 73% of all exposures were already below 50 mg/m\3\,and the combined data indicate that only 2% of employees were exposed above150 mg/m\3\ and none were above 200 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 583-48).A similar picture is presented by the OSHA inspection data set, which includes20 air lead monitoring results from five ingot producers (Ex. 574, p. 2).Those data show that 55% of all monitoring results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,and 90% are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Only 2 results are between 100-200andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 574, p. 2). Even looking at the ABBIM data (Ex. 665), OSHA notes the following. ForCompany C, exposure levels have significantly decreased since 1985. Forexample, 75% of the sampling results at Company C were below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in 1987, while only 11% and 33% were below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1986 and1985, respectively (Ex. 665, p. 4). Similarly, all of the sampling resultsat Company C were below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1987, while only 55% and 58%were below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1986 and 1985, respectively (Ex. 665, p.4). Viewed operation by operation, substantial reductions in exposure levelswere achieved from 1985-87 in all operations at Company C for which ABBIMprovided data. Monitoring results for companies A and B were considerablyhigher than those for Company C. Nonetheless, of the 64 combined exposuremonitoring results from all three companies, only two sampling resultsexceeded 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\. This fact, in conjunction with the trend inmonitoring results from Company C, further confirms OSHA's understanding,based primarily on the JACA and OSHA inspection data, that at many ingotproducers 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ already is being achieved in most of the operationsand that excursions above 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\ are rare (Exs. 553-4, p. 1-4;574, p. 2; 583-48). <T3>Existing Controls. </T3>OSHA has shown in the previous section thatas early as 1979-81, 74% of ingot production employees were reported tobe exposed below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-4). Recent OSHA inspectiondata appear to confirm this picture, with 55% of all exposure levels inall operations at inspected brass and bronze ingot plants already below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 574, p. 2). These exposure levels have been achieved with existing controls. JACA reportedthat, in 1981, brass and bronze ingot makers employed manual sorting ofscrap and movement of scrap by front-end loader or truck, and that someproducers used water spray in the scrapyard to suppress dust (Ex. 553-4,p. 1-3). JACA noted that the extent of the use of local exhaust ventilationon briquetting machines in this sector was not known (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-3).In 1981, facilities visited by JACA had local exhaust ventilation overthe furnace tap hole, launder, or ladles; however, JACA reported that theextent to which employers in this sector were using charging hoods on theirfurnaces in 1981 was not known. Based on JACA's 1981 data and on OSHA's recent inspection data, OSHA believesthat most ingot producers with these controls already are controlling mostof their air lead levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA also believesthat many producers without such controls are not achieving employee airlead levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA recognizes that both ABBIM and another commenter have asserted thata number of facilities in the industry do not now have such controls ordo not have controls with sufficient volume of air flow (Exs. 582-85, pp.20-23; 683, pp. 11-13). OSHA is aware that some brass and bronze ingotproducers are not using adequate engineering controls. For example, indescribing Company A (Ex. 665, p. 2), ABBIM reports that windy conditionsor high humidity may cause Company A's air lead levels to fluctuate. OSHAbelieves that Company A is relying heavily on natural ventilation ratherthan engineering controls, which would not be affected by wind or humidity.OSHA believes that the reason for Company A's high readings is the lackof engineering controls. However, neither ABBIM nor any other producerin the industry has submitted data or other information to the record todocument baseline control levels. OSHA finds that most plants in this sector already are achieving air leadlevels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and have very few monitoring resultsthat are above 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA believes that these exposure levelstestify to the fact that many facilities in this sector are adequatelyand efficiently controlled. A description of the current level of controls, operation by operation,follows. <T3>Scrap Preparation. </T3>Local exhaust is being used at some plantson briquetting machines. At Company A, for example, side-draft ventilationhas been installed there (Ex. 665, p. 2). Although Company A asserts withoutdocumentation that side-draft ventilation has not produced the anticipatedreductions in exposure levels in this operation (Ex. 665, p. 2). briquettingis evidently not a problem operation for many brass and bronze ingot producers(Ex. 553-4, p. 1-4). For example, in facilities where employers have installedbriquetting machines of the type described by NIOSH (Ex. 568, p. 177),the briquetter operators' exposure level has been reduced to an average8-hour TWA of 38 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In addition, some companies apparentlyuse little radiator scrap, which results in lower exposure levels (e.g.,Company C, Ex. 665). <T3>Furnace Operations. </T3>Local exhaust is being used at some plantsover furnaces, and is common on launders and ladles, and at tapping points(Ex. 553-4, pp. 1-3 to 1-6). Company C, for example, has hooding aboveits furnace (Ex. 665). Some hoods over the top of reverberatory furnacesare provided with automatic damper opening systems, which effectively keepsthe furnace at negative pressure during charging to prevent lead fume anddust from escaping into the workplace air (Ex. 574, p. 20). A flue gascontrol system, consisting of a brick-lined flue that connects to steelductwork leading to baghouses, also is used to control emissions duringfurnace charging and slagging. This control system provides sufficientdraft to capture emissions before they can exit through the charging door.At some plants, the charging door and jamb are water cooled to minimizewarpage and maintain a good seal. The water cooled charging door is remotelyoperated from a station where furnace burning rate can also be regulated.In addition, many plants have local exhaust over the tapping port (Exs.574, p. 20; 553-4, p. 1-6) and have covered the launder that carries moltenmetal from the furnace to the ladles (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-6). <T3>Pouring. </T3>Most ingot producers in the industry now rely upon automatic,rather than hand pouring to cast ingots (Exs. 574, p. 1; 582-85, p. 32).Where pouring is done automatically by rotating carousel, the tapping pointis hooded and exhausted to the baghouse (Ex. 568, pp. 190-92). <T3>Baghouse. </T3> Brass and bronze ingot producers have baghouses tocapture the dust generated in their facilities (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-3). Thesebaghouses, installed for purposes of air pollution control, filter exhaustair from hood systems positioned over emission sources and collect contaminateddust. Baghouse dust contains substantial amounts of lead. Baghouses canbe a significant source of lead dust exposure for employees who tend themor who are responsible for recycling or disposing of dust collected bybaghouses. Since this dust can contaminate an entire facility, it mustbe carefully handled. Many plants, like Company B, have installed screwconveyors to move the dust from the baghouses to a central location toawait further disposition (Exs. 665, p. 3; 574, p. 21). This substantiallyreduces manual removal of dust from the baghouse, which, in turn, reducesworker exposure and the potential for spills that could contaminate thearea or plant.<T3>Additional Controls. </T3>OSHA believes, based upon JACA and OSHA inspectiondata, that most employee exposures in brass and bronze ingot facilitiesare already controlled below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA therefore finds, simplyon the basis of these data, that it is technologically feasible for brassand bronze ingot makers to achieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL using conventionalcontrols. However, OSHA is also aware that certain facilities in this sectorare not adequately controlled (e.g., Company A, which continues to relyon natural ventilation, and other facilities that still hand pour (Ex.582-85, p. 31)). To aid these facilities in reducing their employee exposures,OSHA in this section describes additional controls that may be implementedto achieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL. In addition, where necessary, OSHA recommends that ingot producers generallyimprove their engineering controls as indicated below and eliminate crosscontamination to control employee air lead levels consistently to or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. With these improvements, OSHA anticipates that exposurelevels in all production operations will be controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.OSHA believes that for operations where most employees already are exposedbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, relatively modest improvements in work practicecontrols, such as improved housekeeping or better preventive maintenance,will be sufficient to reduce the lead exposures of employees consistentlybelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarly, for the remaining operations where employeesare exposed to air lead levels of less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA believesthat a combination of limited additional and improved controls (e.g., improvingthe efficiency of the ventilation system) will be sufficient to controlexposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. On the whole, the same sorts of readily available, conventional controlsthat have successfully reduced exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in many plants in this industry and in similar industries, like non-ferrousfoundries and secondary copper smelters, are precisely the kinds of additionalcontrols that OSHA recommends to other ingot producers to reduce employeeair lead levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The Agency's discussion of the reductions in air lead levels expected tobe achieved by implementing recommended controls relies in part on assessmentsmade by OSHA's contractor, Meridian. Meridian's assessments are based upondata in the record and its extensive experience and expertise in industrialhygiene. For purposes of determining technological feasibility, OSHA hasalso made its own analysis of additional controls and anticipated reductionsin air lead levels in ingot production. OSHA's analysis is supported bythe testimony of its expert witness, Fredrick W. Boelter (Ex. 607). OSHA's discussion of additional controls and expected reductions is alsobased upon OSHA's independent analysis of processes and controls in thesecondary copper smelting and non-ferrous foundry industries, which aresimilar in many respects to ingot production. Representatives of theseindustries provided better data than did ingot producers, particularlyconcerning exposure levels and associated controls. Unlike ingot producers,representatives of both industries also arranged site visits to facilities.For these reasons, OSHA believes that some of the best evidence concerningadditional controls and expected reductions in employee air lead levelsamong users may come from submissions and testimony about these other industries.Consequently, OSHA believes it is reasonable and entirely appropriate torely on that evidence in assessing the technological feasibility of achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controls iningot production. In previous rulemakings, OSHA has relied upon evidenceconcerning one industry to prove feasibility in a similar industry (e.g.,51 FR 22656, DATE), and that reliance was not rejected by the courts. <T3>Bldg and Construction Trades Dept, AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>838 F.2d 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The similarities between brass and bronze ingot production, secondary coppersmelting and non-ferrous foundries are substantial. Ingot production islike secondary copper production in its scrap preparation and like non-ferrousfoundries in its furnace and pouring operations. In addition, as discussedbelow, facilities in each of these pyro-metallurgical sectors have manyoperations and procedures in common. Like copper smelting, ingot production involves copper-based scrap, typicallycontaining a substantial amount of lead, as the raw material, and dependsupon refining to produce the finished product. Unlike copper smelting,ingot production does not involve smelting and therefore does not entailthe high exposure levels associated with blast furnaces. In addition, unlikecopper smelting, the refining process in ingot production is not aimedat removing all metals, like lead, to produce increasingly pure copper.Rather, the purpose in ingot production is to remove only those contaminantsthat do not meet particular alloy specifications. In these aspects, ingotproduction, as industry concedes (Ex. 582-85, p. 5), is similar to theprocess used by non-ferrous foundries that produce lead-containing alloycastings. Indeed, alloy ingots are the primary raw material for the non-ferrousfoundry industry. In both industries lead is present throughout the productionof leaded alloys, and therefore the potential for lead exposure existsin nearly every operation, and is especially great in hot operations. To the extent that ingot production is similar to copper smelting and non-ferrousfoundries, information concerning sources of exposure, exposure levels,and controls in those industries is applicable to ingot production. Theprinciple of control technology transfer, for example, is widely acknowledged(Ex. 568, p. 9). Many operations in different sectors of the pyro-metallurgicalindustry have commonalities that make them excellent candidates for suchtransfer. Among these similarities are: their use of heat to reduce, refineand alloy metals; their handling and preparation of feed materials; theiruse of furnaces; their production of metal products, slag, and by-productwastes; their use of emission controls (baghouses, ducts, etc.); and theirpotential for causing employee exposure to metal dust and fume (Ex. 568,p. 9). Specifically, for example, regarding the scrapyard, where the sources ofexposure, applicable controls, and lead content of the scrap in ingot productionand in secondary copper smelting are similar, OSHA believes it should beas easy to control scrap preparation in ingot production as it is in secondarycopper smelting. OSHA further believes that cross contamination, whichis a problem in both secondary copper smelting and non-ferrous foundries,is a problem in brass and bronze ingot production as well. The benefits of transfer of technology include the avoidance of duplicationof effort in developing and testing controls, reductions in the costs ofcompliance, increases in the chances of achieving successful emission control,and reductions in employee exposures. <T3>Prevention of Cross Contamination and Cross Drafts. </T3>In non-ferrousfoundries two of the major sources of cross contamination are furnace operationsand pouring. Furnace operations and pouring in ingot production are verysimilar to those in non-ferrous foundries. These operations therefore havesimilar potentials for cross contamination. There is, moreover, nothingin the record to suggest that the level of controls or applied industrialhygiene currently is materially different in ingot production than in non-ferrousfoundries. OSHA therefore assumes that the problem of cross contaminationis at least as severe in some ingot production facilities as it is in somenon-ferrous foundries. This assumption is supported by evidence of highbackground levels and cross contamination in brass and bronze facilitiesat which NIOSH conducted in-depth surveys (e.g., Ex. 568, pp. 195, 200).The Agency notes that the typical increment to exposure levels attributedto cross contamination in non-ferrous foundries is at least 20 andCx.18;g/m\3\.This cross contamination can be eliminated in ingot production in the samemanner and to the same extent that it can be controlled in non-ferrousfoundries. Consequently, OSHA hereby incorporates into this assessmentof ingot production on how to control cross contamination that appearsin the non-ferrous foundry section of this preamble. OSHA wishes to emphasize two points from that analysis. First, it is vitalin controlling cross contamination to contain cross drafts, which not onlyspread contamination from one operation to another but also compromiselocal exhaust ventilation, preventing exhaust hoods from operating at maximumeffectiveness (Ex. 583-13. p. 7-2). Second, to remedy the problem of crosscontamination, as well as other problems, OSHA believes that the firstthing ingot producers must do is obtain the services of experienced industrialhygienists. These professionals can perform plant-wide industrial hygienestudies that focus on a task-by-task analysis of sources of exposure andcan analyze cross drafts and cross contamination as a basis for designingcross draft barriers and other measures to eliminate them. OSHA is confident that such studies are essential to the systematic controlof air lead levels in inadequately controlled plants in this industry.Such studies are a precondition for employers instituting effective, regularprograms to identify the precise sources of exposure and reasons for upsetconditions in order to determine how best to reduce them to a minimum (Ex.686A, pp. 40-41). OSHA believes, as Meridian stated in connection withnon-ferrous foundries, that no control measure is as likely to producesuch dramatic results in controlling air lead levels in ingot productionas the relatively low-cost approach of obtaining the services of an industrialhygienist (Exs. 686A, p. 41; 689-3, p. 1).If undertaking plant-wide hygiene surveys and preventing cross contaminationare among the most important steps that can be taken to reduce exposurelevels generally throughout this industry, other conventional controlsthat are applicable to many operations also should be implemented broadlyto reduce exposure levels. Implementation of effective conventional controlsalready has dramatically reduced exposure levels in various operationsthroughout this industry (e.g., Exs. 574. p. 70; 686D, pp. 7-8; 568, pp.177-82). The controls recommended by OSHA include better exhaust ventilation,enclosure, isolation, automation of the production process, and betterwork practices (e.g., housekeeping and preventive maintenance). <T3>Ventilation. </T3>The presence of excessive lead in the work environmentsof some ingot producing facilities indicates that existing engineeringcontrols like local exhaust ventilation (LEV) and general dilution ventilationare not doing the job. Although much more quantitative and other informationthan industry has provided would be needed to state with any precisionhow great a reduction of any particular exposure level could be achievedby enhancing specific ventilation systems, OSHA believes that in many operationsimproved or additional ventilation can achieve major reductions in workerexposure. Such controls have been developed, tested, and where found effective, manufacturedand applied widely for many years throughout industry to control specificcontaminants. Conventional controls for nearly every operation in ingotproduction, secondary copper smelters and foundries have been describedin detail and often depicted in photographs or diagrams by industrial hygienistsand engineers from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists(e.g., Exs. 583-13, pp. 5-4 to 5-20, 5-41, 5-48 to 5-60), the AmericanFoundrymen's Society (AFS) (Exs. 689-3; 689-4), NIOSH (Ex. 645), AmericanNational Standards Institute (ANSI) (Exs. 689-13A, 13B, 13C), and manyconsultants who have worked for OSHA or industry (e.g., Exs. 689-6; 689-7;689-8; 689-9; 689-10; 689-11; 689-12). The ventilation controls applicableto ingot production are basically the same as those applicable to comparableoperations in secondary copper smelting and non-ferrous foundries. Improved or additional ventilation can achieve major reductions in airlead levels, for example, at briquetting (Exs. 568, p. 177; 574, pp. 19-20)and in furnace operations (Ex. 574, p. 20). More generally, OSHA believesthat in many ingot producing facilities, as in many non-ferrous foundries,ventilation capacity often may be inadequate and may have to be increased(e.g., Exs. 689-3, p. 26; 689-4D, fig. 19). OSHA anticipates that increasingventilation capacity to satisfy generally accepted criteria (e.g., Exs.689-3; 689-4D, fig. 19) should result in nearly total capture of emissionsby any properly designed hood. As indicated in OSHA's discussion of non-ferrous foundries and incorporatedhere by reference, it is imperative that improvements to existing ventilationand newly-installed ventilation be properly designed and installed. Inaddition, ventilation systems must be maintained regularly to assure theireffectiveness. <T3>Enclosure and Isolation. </T3>Enclosure and isolation are two alternativemethods of separating workers from air contaminants. In the case of isolation,the employee is physically separated from contaminants in the air, forexample, by working in a filtered, ventilated control booth (e.g.,  Exs.684D, p. 15; 689-4D, fig. 32). With enclosure, the source of the contaminantis physically contained and separated from the rest of the work environmentto prevent contamination of the air (e.g.. Exs. 586-l8, figs. 1, 2; 583-13,p. 4-14). Docket entries generally describe standard enclosure techniques that arein use, or can be readily implemented in industry (e.g., blast furnacecharging door enclosure, casting operation enclosure; Exs. 568, p. 54;590, p. 22). Simple isolation techniques that have been successfully usedin plants in this and other lead industries are applicable throughout thisindustry (e.g., providing employees with filtered, ventilated cabs formobile equipment, fresh air islands, isolation booths for rotary furnacetapping, and control rooms; Exs. 568, p. 114; 590, p. 11; 684f, p. 13;689-4D, p. 7-14, figs. 31, 32). Isolating workers even for a portion of their shift can significantly reduceexposure levels. For example, a Radian study of a secondary lead smelterdemonstrates that employee exposures can be reduced by 23-77% even whenemployees spend only a portion of the workday in an isolation booth (Ex.583-16, p. 30). A second Radian study (Ex. 568, p. 217) reported that useof a fresh air island for a casting wheel operator in a brass and bronzeingot producing facility effectively reduced employee exposure to fumesmigrating from the tapping/pouring operation. Another study, by NIOSH,investigating the effectiveness of various control technologies in secondarylead smelters, reports that workers spending even one-quarter of theirtime in a supplied air island would experience a 20% reduction in their8-hour TWA exposure levels (Ex. 590, p. 40). Consequently, in ingot productionsupplied air islands could be installed near the furnace, for example,to reduce remaining excess exposures for operators after other controlsare implemented. <T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices, and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices, and preventive maintenance are essential controls whoseimportance frequently is not adequately recognized by employers. Failureto develop and use rigorous housekeeping, good work practices, and preventivemaintenance can destroy the effectiveness of otherwise adequate engineeringcontrols. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of good housekeeping andwork practices (e.g., Exs. 475-32D, H-004H; 607, p. 6). Each ingot producershould thoroughly clean its entire facility, including rafters, at leastannually. Moreover, to the extent that ingot producers rely upon dry sweeping,the practice should be eliminated and be replaced to the extent practicableby wet cleaning or vacuuming. Such straight-forward improvements in housekeepingas these have been estimated by Meridian to be likely to reduce workerexposures in general by 10-25% in the non-ferrous foundry industry (Ex.686a, p. 22). Detailed housekeeping instructions also should be prepared and adherenceto them enforced by employers, with scheduling and checkoff of regularcleaning of all areas of the plant where dust can  collect. If necessary,housekeeping instructions should 1ist individual sites, pieces of equipment,parts of equipment, and obscure corners (e.g., under screw conveyors) toassure that they are cleaned regularly. Implementing appropriate work practice controls is also vital to achievingexposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Many engineering controlsoften can only be as effective as the associated work practices that determinehow they are used and where the employee locates himself or herself relativeto the controls (Ex. 607, p. 6). For example, scrap preparation for chargingand charging itself should be done in a manner that minimizes the probabilityof jams in the throat of the charging hopper, which subject the chargerneedlessly to exposure to lead fumes and dust by requiring him or her toclimb the charging deck to dislodge the jam (Ex. 568, p. 247).Work practices also should be written to prescribe correct procedures forall tasks that might result in increased employee exposure. Such proceduresshould dictate, for example, that employees remove themselves from proximityto a source of exposure whenever possible and, to the extent possible,isolate themselves from contaminants by standing in a fresh-air islandor booth. Similarly, the storage of slag in open bins should be prohibited.Care also should be taken to assure that covers or exhaust hoods are kepton ladles filled with molten metal whenever possible (Exs. 568, p. 48;607, p. 4).OSHA also notes the importance of maintenance programs to assure that allsystems function as cleanly and as efficiently as practicable (e.g., Ex.689-3, p. 74, Table 8-1; and see <T3>Safety in Metal Casting,</T3> Des Plaines, IL, Vol. 6, 1970, p. 172).Exhaust systems lose their capacity because belts and pulleys slip, ductbranches become clogged, duct couplings become loose and develop holesthat leak air, filters become occluded, and fan blades become corrodedor unbalanced. Thus, the effectiveness of engineering controls can be severelylimited by poor maintenance.OSHA also recommends the following controls operation by operation.<T3>Scrap Preparation.</T3> The main source of lead exposure in scrap preparationis lead oxide that forms on scrap, which is emitted as dust when the scrapis handled. This source of dust is most difficult to control in briquetting,where scrap of varying sizes and shapes is mechanically compressed. Nonetheless,with proper engineering controls briquetting can be controlled to below50 mg/m\3\. For example, by implementing local exhaust ventilation at briquettingmachines, area samples indicate that exposure levels have been reducedto between 32-43 mg/m\3\. Alternatively, employers may install a briquettingmachine of the type described by NIOSH, which reduced the briquetter operators'average 8-hour, TWA to 38 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 568, p. 177).In addition, to control air lead levels in the scrapyard in general, OSHArecommends the wetting of scrap before handling to suppress lead dust.JACA reported in 1982 that some brass and bronze ingot producers used waterspray to reduce dust in the scrapyard and on scrap going to the briquetter(Ex. 553-4, p. 1-3). OSHA recognizes that where scrap is moistened it cannotsafely be charged directly into the furnace and therefore also recommendsthat, prior to charging, all wet scrap be pre-heated. OSHA believes thatits recommendation to preheat scrap should not pose any additional burdenon ingot facilities since most scrap must be preheated because it is storedoutside, exposed to weather. Where only a few of the combined controlsOSHA recommends for the scrapyard were implemented in the scrapyard ofa large secondary copper smelter, 60% of the exposures were below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 684d, p. 14).Additional measures that could be implemented by ingot producers whoseexposures in the scrapyard continue to be excessive even after scrap wettingis introduced include enclosing the scrapyard, installing a cement floorfor ease of washing, and installation of effective exhaust systems in briquetters(Ex. 568, p. 177).<T3>Furnaces.</T3> The furnaces are the primary emission source for theentire facility, particularly during such activities as charging, slagging,and tapping. Local exhaust hoods installed over all furnace openings, liketapping and charging ports, constitute the most effective control for metalfume emissions from the furnaces. These hoods are available in close-capture,fixed, mobile and telescopic forms, which can be adapted to various circumstancesand multiple operations (Ex. 583-13).The effectiveness of such controls in reducing air lead levels in furnaceoperations is manifested in area and breathing zone exposure data collectedby NIOSH as part of an in-depth survey it carried out at an unnamed ingotplant. Both breathing zone and area sample results there uniformly indicateexposure levels well below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 568, p. 249, Table 13). Thisingot manufacturer achieved such levels by operating the furnace at negativepressure during charging and providing local exhaust at the tapping port(Ex. 568, p. 236). The effectiveness of these controls on melting furnacesis also demonstrated by the exposure levels achieved at Company K, whereair lead samples consistently are below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 583-48).In addition to implementing additional controls that capture emissionsat their sources, other engineering controls can be implemented in thefurnace area to isolate workers from lead fume and dust. As discussed abovein the subsection describing isolation of workers, devices such as isolationbooths, control rooms, and fresh-air islands can provide additional meansto further reduce furnace employees' exposures even if employees can spendonly a portion of their time isolated from contaminants.<T3>Pouring. </T3>Several controls are available in pouring to achieve50 mg/m\3\ where it is not now consistently being achieved. These includeimplementing local exhaust ventilation at the tap hole and the ladle. Thistechnology was employed at one brass and bronze ingot plant, and employeeexposure levels in the pouring area were reduced to 36 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 568,p. 249). To achieve additional exposure reductions in the pouring area,local exhaust ventilation also should be implemented in the ingot coolingarea, as was done at a second unnamed ingot facility (Ex. 568, pp. 217-18).Supplied air islands can be provided to ladlemen and pourers, as well,as they were in one ingot facility (Ex. 568, pp. 215-16). The combinationof exhausting the cooling area and providing fresh air islands for thepouring area achieved exposure levels of 16-17 mg/m\3\ for the pourer and23-29 mg/m\3\ for the ladleman in one ingot plant (Ex. 568, p. 208).<T3>Baghouse and Dust Control.</T3> Control measures for baghouses anddust handling include establishing proper work practices to be followed,repairing and maintaining baghouses to eliminate leaks and ensure properfunctioning of cleaning mechanisms, shielding baghouses from wind by erectingbarriers, providing ventilation at dust-packaging operations, and installingan automatic dust-packaging system that uses mechanized material handlingequipment such as a screw conveyor.Repair and maintenance of the baghouse is an intermittent maintenance activity.During that activity baghouse operators traditionally use respirators toperform their duties where engineering controls are not feasible. OSHAacknowledges that in such situations respirators are needed to supplementavailable engineering controls to adequately protect employees.<T3>Technological Feasibility. </T3>Based upon the above analysis of theevidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, the Agencydetermines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by engineering andwork practice controls is technologically feasible in the brass and bronzeingot production industry as a whole. To sum up, OSHA has shown the following. As long ago as 1979-81, nearlythree-quarters (74%) of all employees in ingot production were reportedto be exposed at levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Indeed, according to theseindustry-supplied data, nearly one-half (44%) of all employees were exposedbelow 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\. At Plant K, for example, 94% of the 68 employeeswere exposed below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1981, and the only operation whereexposure levels were above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ was the baghouse, essentiallya maintenance operation. Recent OSHA inspection data confirm this generalpicture, with average exposure levels in all operations for the inspectedplants already at, below, or not far above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-4,p. 1-4; 583-48; 574, p. 4). These results have been achieved with existing controls, before OSHA'srecommended additional controls have been implemented and before crosscontamination has been controlled. With the implementation of additionalcontrols and the control of cross contamination, OSHA anticipates thatexposure levels in all operations, with the possible exception of baghousemaintenance, will be consistently controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.This conclusion is supported by OSHA's feasibility assessments in the otherpyrometallurgical industries, secondary copper smelting and non-ferrousfoundries, the relevant portions of which are hereby incorporated intothis assessment. For both these industries, OSHA has determined that itis technologically feasible to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineeringand work practice controls alone. OSHA is confident that the controls availableto achieve the PEL in those industries are applicable, with no more thanmodest modifications, to those facilities in brass and bronze ingot productionthat still have inadequate controls. With regard to the controls needed to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in ingotproduction, OSHA wishes to point out that all of its recommended controlsare conventional and readily available. OSHA has not needed to exerciseits statutory authority to force the development of new technology in thisindustry to justify the Agency's finding of feasibility. In reaching its conclusion, OSHA does not purport to have recommended anexhaustive list of additional controls. The Agency is certain that industrywill be capable of devising and fine-tuning various controls to furtherreduce exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA anticipates that industry willbe able to consistently achieve exposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in virtually every phase of production. OSHA believes that achieving the PEL requires implementing an integratedsystem of controls. The basic element of that system is an industrial hygienestudy. Each ingot producer is required by paragraph (e)(3) of the leadstandard (29 CFR 1910.1025) to establish and implement a written complianceprogram that includes an in-depth job/task analysis and a plant-wide survey.This survey and analysis should be performed by an experienced industrialhygienist who shall identify sources of emission in each task and sourcesof cross drafts and cross contamination. Such an analysis should also recommendappropriate engineering and work practice controls to control emissions,control cross drafts and cross contamination, and generally minimize employeeexposures. If, after implementing these recommendations, reductions inair lead levels deviate substantially from what was anticipated, a followupindustrial hygiene survey should be conducted and necessary correctionsmade. The second element in that system is the development of good, written housekeepingand work practice programs, as required by paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of thelead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025), that are systematically implemented sothat proper work procedures are routinely and meticulously followed. Forexample, wall-to-wall cleanups should be conducted at least annually. The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean, efficient,and effective condition. The brass and bronze ingot production industry does not agree that a PELof 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable. Industry's disagreement is based uponsix main arguments. The six main arguments are: A prior OSHA contractorand OSHA itself previously concluded that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is not feasible;Meridian's report is incorrect, incompetent and unsupported; in any event,the evidence in the remand record does not support a determination that50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible; factors unique to ingot productionmake it impossible to consistently achieve  50 andCx.18;g/m\3\; technologydoes not exist to control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in particularoperations; and even if it were feasible to consistently achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in newly constructed plants, that PEL cannot be achieved by retrofittingolder plants. First, industry asserts that OSHA's contractor, JACA, previously concludedthat it was not technologically feasible to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ withoutsubstantially rebuilding plants. Industry further asserts that in 1983OSHA itself found 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ technologically infeasible in brassand bronze ingot production (Exs. 582-85, pp. 14-17; 582-89, pp. 39-40;680, pp. 4-6 and 10). In response, OSHA agrees that JACA did conclude that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ wastechnologically infeasible without substantial rebuilding of plants. However,even if JACA were correct, this does not mean that the PEL is technologicallyinfeasible. On the contrary, JACA's point is that the PEL is technologicallyfeasible, but, by implication, that achieving it is likely to be expensive.OSHA agrees with JACA that the PEL is technologically feasible but rejectsthe rest of JACA's conclusion as inconsistent with, and unsupported bythe very data upon which it is based. JACA's own data show that nearlythree-fourths of employees in ingot production already were exposed below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by the years 1977-81 (Ex. 553-4, p. 1-4). The data furthershow that nearly one-half of all employees were exposed below 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\,which is nearly twice the percentage exposed above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Moreover,JACA does not explain how it reached its conclusion about the supposedneed for substantial rebuilding. In fact, the focus in the JACA report is almost exclusively on economic,rather than technological feasibility. There is no industrial hygiene analysisin the report, and the report does not present substantial arguments orconduct meaningful analysis of data in support of any conclusion abouttechnological feasibility. In any event, the determination of feasibility is for the Agency aloneto make. Industry asserts that OSHA has already made that determination,finding that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is infeasible in this industry. Industryis incorrect. In 1983 some members of OSHA's staff did draft a documentthat included a finding of infeasibility for brass and bronze ingot production(Ex. 570). However, that draft never received Agency approval. In addition,the draft finding appears to have been based exclusively upon the JACAconclusion and is therefore vulnerable to the same criticisms. Furthermore,OSHA had previously informed the court that it needed more informationto determine feasibility for this industry. Since then, OSHA has receivedconsiderably more information about this and similar industries, whichthe Agency has relied upon in this assessment of feasibility. Second, industry argues that Meridian's report is incorrect, incompetentand unsupported by record evidence (Exs. 582-85, pp. 20-23, 31 and 37;582-89, pp. 38-41; 664, p. 1; 680, pp. 18-19; and 683, p. 10). On the whole,OSHA rejects these criticisms and believes that Meridian did a creditablejob, given time and resource constraints.Meridian has had extensive experience and possesses very broad competencein the area of industrial hygiene, the principles of which are universallyapplicable to all industries. It also has broad expertise and experiencein assessing factors relevant to technological feasibility. Physically,there is nothing unique about lead dust and lead fume or about brass andbronze ingot production that would make Meridian's extensive expertiseand competence in evaluating engineering and work practice controls acrossmany industries irrelevant to this industry. The control technologies recommendedhere are conventional and transferrable from similar industries, and theanticipated effectiveness of these controls in reducing air lead levelsalso is the same across industries. Of course, notwithstanding its experience and expertise, Meridian may havedrawn some incorrect conclusions and made certain mistakes of fact. Thisis almost inevitable when a contractor can devote only limited time andresources to examining a complex industry and record. Such mistakes arealso more likely to occur where, as here, the industry has declined totestify and subject itself to any questioning at the public hearing andhas declined to arrange site visits to its plants. OSHA actively soughtto set up site visits in this industry similar to those OSHA carried outin four other lead industries after the 1987 hearing, but representativesof ingot producers did not make such sites available (Ex. 690B). OSHA concludes that Meridian's reports and its conclusions are based uponthe best available evidence. Meridian's reports, including revisions toits preliminary report based upon industry comments, generally are firmlygrounded in the record, and its conclusions are based  on numerous sourcesin that record. These include data, other evidence, and comments submittedby employers, trade associations and other interested parties. In any event, OSHA has independently assessed the record, reviewed Meridian'sfinal report for accuracy, taken account of industry's comments on thatreport, and relied only in part upon the Meridian reports for the Agency'sdetermination of technological feasibility. In contrast to Meridian, forexample, the Agency has found the data submitted by ABBIM not to be usefuland has placed greater emphasis on the JACA data. Third, industry argues that the evidence in the remand record does notsupport a determination that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible.OSHA, of course, disagrees, as this feasibility assessment would indicate.The Agency further notes that industry has failed to present data and contextualinformation to show that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be technologically achievedby engineering and work practice controls alone. OSHA's statutory obligation is to make its feasibility determination basedon the best available evidence in the record. OSHA has actively soughtto collect and develop a full and accurate record. OSHA is persuaded thatit has more than enough information and data in the record upon which tobase its determination of technological feasibility. However, OSHA recognizes that there would be substantially more useableinformation and data in the record had the brass and bronze ingot productionindustry been cooperative in developing that record. For example, since1979 the lead industries have been required by the lead standard to conductquarterly monitoring of all employees exposed above the PEL; that is, theyhave been required to regularly monitor all operations in which there mightconceiveably be technological feasibility problems. Thus a wealth of exposuremonitoring data exists on this topic. Nonetheless industry representatives provided very little of that datato the record, despite frequent requests by OSHA. In fact, no ingot producerdirectly submitted air lead monitoring results to the record in the recentproceedings. The single industry submission of exposure data is from anindustry trade association, is limited to 64 selected data points in threeplants, and is unaccompanied by any substantial description of associatedcontrols (Ex. 665). OSHA also is certain that the record in this rulemakingwould be much richer had industry not declined to participate in site visitsand declined to testify at the public hearing and to subject itself tocross examination by OSHA and others. In arguing that the record does not support the feasibility of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,industry has asserted that 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is the lowest level technologicallyachieveable (e.g., Ex. 680, p. 9). Industry has failed to present dataand information to support this position. In fact, even the sparse datait chose to provide consistently show not only that 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\ isachieveable but also that it already has been achieved (e.g., only twoof the 64 monitoring results provided by ABBIM are above 150; nearly two-thirdsare below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\; Ex. 665).OSHA therefore finds industry's argument that the evidence in the recordis insufficient to prove the technological feasibility of a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\unpersuasive.Fourth, industry argues that certain factors in ingot production, likethe varying amounts of lead used in particular alloys and the variabilityof the weather, make it impossible to consistently achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(e.g., Exs. 581-14, pp. 2, 9; 664, pp. 1-2; 665; 668D). OSHA disagrees.Such factors, as well as any variability in exposure levels that may resultfrom them, are typical of many lead-using industries for which the feasibilityof the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ already has been determined by OSHA andapproved by the courts (Ex. 686D, pp. 11-12).Variability in exposure levels above and below an average over time haslong been recognized by industrial hygienists. However, as employers inother lead industries have reported, part of this apparent variabilitymay be caused by contamination of the sampling process (e.g., Ex. 684e,p. 7).Eliminating the factor of sample contamination, most variability in exposurelevels is the result of factors that are within the control of the employer(e.g., poor work practices, inadequate housekeeping, and most upset conditions;Ex. 686D, p. 11). OSHA strongly believes that if production and engineeringand work practice controls are properly and consistently carried out, thefactors causing variability will be largely controlled and the range ofvariability will be substantially narrowed. OSHA therefore considers evidenceof repeated, wide-ranging variability in exposure levels as evidence ofthe inadequacy of controls. That inadequacy, of course, hardly constitutesevidence of infeasibility.However, OSHA recognizes that some variability is random and beyond theemployer's control. As discussed earlier in this preamble, OSHA has determinedthat this random variability does not make it technologically infeasiblefor brass and bronze ingot producers to achieve the PEL. Moreover, as indicatedabove, OSHA has built some flexibility into its enforcement policy to takeaccount of random variability.Once the range of variability has been narrowed by effective controls,the degree of latitude for variability that is built into OSHA's determinationthat the PEL is feasible should prove sufficient. This latitude is implicitin OSHA's determination that in most operations ingot producers will beable to reduce exposures to levels that are reasonably below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.For example, JACA data show that as long as seven years ago nearly halfof all employees already were exposed below 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-4,p. 1-4).Nonetheless, OSHA understands that from time to time peak exposures dueto unforeseeable upsets or other aberrational events will exceed the latitudefor variability. OSHA believes that the notion of technological feasibilityadopted by the courts_capable of being achieved in most operations mostof the time_takes such realities into account. OSHA further believes thatthe Agency's Field Operations Manual (FOM), which suggests that OSHA inspectorsre-monitor exposure levels in cases where OSHA's monitoring shows resultsthat are unusually high relative to those in the employers' exposure records,also takes account of such realities in OSHA's enforcement activities.As a result, OSHA does not believe that such excursions are relevant tothis feasibility determination.Fifth, industry argues that the technology does not exist to control exposurelevels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in particular operations. OSHA does not agree.Industry at best has shown that certain plants, in certain operations likebriquetting and baghouse maintenance are not achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\with existing controls. However, ingot producers have made no showing,and have scarcely argued that these plants have implemented state-of-the-arttechnology in these problem operations. Based upon OSHA's analysis of several,relatively advanced non-ferrous foundries with similar operations and exposureproblems, OSHA is certain that no ingot producer has approached the levelof technology at which no additional controls can be implemented to furtherreduce exposure levels.Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to show that any plant inthis industry sector has conducted the kind of in-depth industrial hygienesurvey of plant conditions that OSHA considers necessary to identify sourcesof emissions and appropriate controls. Such a survey is necessary for implementingeffective controls. It is the foundation for the kind of integrated controlprogram that is capable of consistently achieving the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL of the lead standard. Without such a survey, industry's claim thatit has already done all that it can to control exposure levels simply isnot credible.In any event, OSHA has already shown that for each and every operation,with the possible exception of baghouse maintenance, at least some plantsin this industry have been able to achieve exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Sixth, industry argues that even if it were feasible to consistently achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in newly constructed plants, that PEL cannot be achievedby retrofitting older plants (Exs. 582-85, pp. 26-27; 664, p. 5; 694-11,p. 4). Essentially, industry appears to be arguing that existing ingotplants would have to be rebuilt to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA doesnot accept this broad assertion, for which industry has failed to presentany supporting evidence. OSHA believes that the record itself demonstratesthat existing plants in this sector can achieve this level without beingrebuilt, as evidenced by the exposure data from industry in 1982 (Exs.583-48; 553-4, p. 1-4).Other record evidence also suggests that this assertion is incorrect. Asthe NIOSH/Radian study has shown, industry can implement many additionalcontrols within existing plants (Ex. 568). Moreover, industry's contentionthat the level of baseline (existing) controls assumed by Meridian is toohigh (Exs. 582-85, p. 23; 664, p. 5; 694-11, p. 6) would seem to concedethat much more can be done to control exposure levels within existing plants.In fact, as previously stated, OSHA has shown that nearly 10 years agomost employees in the industry already were reported to be exposed to airlead levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Exs. 553-4, p. 1-4; 583-48). OSHA hasno reason to believe that these workers were employed only in newly constructedplants. Industry makes no allegation to that effect, and JACA has givenno such indication.Finally, the breadth of industry's assertion regarding rebuilding is similarto the broad scope of industry's claim that 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is the lowestfeasible level. Based upon industry's own recent data submission (Ex. 665),OSHA has shown that assertion to be incorrect, unfounded and thereforenot credible. OSHA also finds not credible industry's broad assertion thatrebuilding of plants generally will be required to achieve the PEL. OSHAbelieves it previously has shown that the PEL can be achieved most of thetime in most operations without rebuilding.Thus, for all the the above reasons, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry'sarguments that the PEL cannot be achieved by means of engineering and workpractice controls. Based upon its own expertise, experience and the recordevidence, the Agency concludes that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achieveablein the brass and bronze ingot production industry by means of engineeringand work practice controls.<T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Brass and bronze ingot producers primarily meltcopper and copper-based scrap, and cast it into blocks and bars. Thesefacilities are classified under SIC code 3341, Secondary Smelting and Refiningof Nonferrous Metals.Information submitted to the docket indicates that there are 16 ingot manufacturersactive in the business today [Ex. 686d. p. 1]. Total production employmentis estimated at approximately 800 [Ex. 686d, p. 1].Recent data show ingot production increased about 4 and one-half percentbetween 1986 and 1987 [1987 Minerals Yearbook, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Departmentof Interior]. Between 1981 and 1982, production dropped 22 percent, from239,423 short tons to 187,126 short tons, and has fluctuated between 185,000and 217,000 short tons since that time [Ex. 574, p. 5].The two leading types of ingots produced between 1980 and 1986 were leadedred brass and semi-red brass, with the former containing 5 to 7 percentlead; high-leaded tin brass, the third leading type of ingot shipped, contains7 to 24 percent lead [Ex. 574, p. 2]. In 1985, these three ingot typesaccounted for over 74 percent of the 199,147 short tons produced by theindustry [Ex. 574. p. 6].The major market for brass and bronze ingots is the foundry industry, whichuses about 70 percent of all ingots produced. In 1987, brass ingot constituted66 percent of all copper materials consumed at U.S. foundries [Bureau ofMines, U.S. Department of the Interior]. Other users of brass and bronzeingots include brass mills, powder plants, and miscellaneous copper andcopper-alloy using industries [Ex. 574, p. 7].Over 97 percent of the copper used to make brass and bronze ingots comesfrom scrap [Ex. 574, p. 7]. The brass and bronze ingot industry competeswith brass mills and foreign bidders for this scrap.Comparisons have been made between quoted prices of the ingot producers'final product and that of the scrap input. Meridian collected data forthe years 1967 through 1985 and reported that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[b]oth red brass scrap and leaded red brass ingots reached a currentdollar price high in 1980. By 1985, red brass scrap prices had declinedby 38 percent, while scrap red brass ingot had declined by 23 percent.* * * When prices are measured in real 1982 dollars * * *, both scrap andingot prices show declines from 1974 peaks. However, the price differentialbetween scrap and ingots has only varied between 37 and 47 cents per poundsince 1981, despite significant changes in the prices of both scrap andingots over the same period [Ex. 574. p. 11].</ITAG>The Association of Brass and Bronze Ingot Manufacturers (ABBIM) and theBrass and Bronze Ingot Institute (BBII) commented that the actual pricedifferential was on the order of 15 to 17 cents per pound in 1987 [Ex.582-85, p. 23]. According to the commenters, this was because virtuallyall ingot is sold at a discount below the list price.Financial information submitted to the docket by the ABBIM was obtainedfrom 11 brass and bronze ingot manufacturers and was aggregated and averaged[Ex. 582-85. Attachment]. This information indicated financial distress.Average return on assets (ROA) for these 11 firms for the year 1986 was0.4 percent. It was not clear from this information whether a few firmswere doing very poorly or whether all firms were realizing very low ratesof return.Publicly available data from Dialog Information Services (Duns FinancialRecords Plus (DFRP)) provided additional information which OSHA found usefulin assessing the financial status of this sector. These data included salesfigures for six brass and bronze ingot producers. Two of these producers,each employing over 150 workers in SIC 3341, realized annual sales of $40million in 1987. Another producer whose primary activities under SIC 3341employed 40 workers and realized annual sales of $9 million in 1986. Thisfirm had an ROA of 2.2 percent and a rate of return on sales (ROS) of 0.7percent. For three additional firms, activities under SIC 3341 were secondaryin nature. Two of these firms, each with 60 employees, realized annualsales of $10 million and $18 million, respectively, in 1987. The third,employing over 160 workers, realized annual sales of $38 million in 1987.These sales data are inconsistent with the sales data reported by the ABBIM.The Dialog data confirm information in the public record which suggestedthat some brass and bronze ingot producers engage in other activities,which may take place at the same location [Ex. 574, p. 15]. For the threefirms noted above for which activities classified under SIC 3341 are secondaryin nature, primary activities are classified under SICs 3334 (Primary Productionof Aluminum) and 3339 (Primary Metal Mills). The latest information availablefrom Dun and Bradstreet [Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios, 1987]indicates that firms in these SIC codes realized rates of return on sales(ROS) of 4.6 percent. The ABBIM data failed to address these additionalactivities; thus, it is not clear whether the ABBIM average sales estimateof $6 million per facility is an estimate of total sales or sales relatedsolely to the production of brass and bronze ingots. In either case, theaverage sales figure provided by the ABBIM appears to substantially underrepresentsales activity in this sector. Additionally, recent price increases (seebelow) indicate demand for ingots has strengthened since 1986, a year whenprices of alloyed brass ingot fell over 4 and one-half percent [Ex. 661].Based on the above discussion, OSHA's economic feasibility assessment isbased on Dun and Bradstreet industry statistics. The ROS reported for SIC3341 in 1988 was 1.7 percent. This rate was based on information obtainedfrom 60 firms, representing about 25 percent of the total number of firmsin SIC 3341.<T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>Compliance costs for the Brass and BronzeIngot sector were estimated by Meridian Research in its 1987 report [Ex.574]. These cost estimates were based on the number of emission sourcesfound in a typical facility and the extent of controls already believedto be in place.Comments were received regarding these cost estimates. ABBIM and BBII statedthat Meridian failed to cost a travel vent for hand pouring and the make-upair required for proper functioning of ventilation systems [Ex. 582-85,p. 21]. In its August, 1987 report, Meridian estimated costs for ventilatingthe pouring ladle and for fresh air islands for the ladleman and pourer;costs for hand pouring were estimated to be similar. With regard to makeup air, Meridian stated in its Addendum to the August, 1987 report thatmake up air was taken into account in the $15 per cfm unit cost [Ex. 686d,p. 13]. These commenters also asserted that Meridian failed to includecosts for materials handling at the briquettor [Ex. 582-85, p. 22]. Costsfor agglomerating devices (briquettors) were identified by Meridian, butOSHA believes that additional costs may be required to provide this ventilation.Accordingly, OSHA has revised the Meridian estimate of $39,000 per agglomeratingdevice to $70,000. OSHA also adjusted Meridian's estimates to include costsfor a scrap pre-heating system, supplied air islands for the furnace area,ventilation for the ingot cooling area, dust packaging controls, isolationbarriers, and housekeeping costs, which include portable vacuum sweepers.These adjustments are detailed below. Additionally, OSHA adjusted downwardthe Meridian assumption of four furnaces per plant to two, based on informationin the public record [Ex. 568, pp. 174-221].Costs for the pre-heating of wetted scrap were estimated to be approximately$400,000 [Ex. 694-11, p. 7]. Annual costs would include annualized capitalcosts, assuming a twelve year useful life and a 10 percent cost of financing,of $58,720 and operating and maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses of $40,000.Total annual costs for the pre-heating of scrap were thus estimated tobe $98,720.A supplied air island for the furnace area would require a $10,000 capitaloutlay. Annualized capital costs would be $1,468 and Oandamp;M expenses wouldbe $1,000. Estimated total annual costs for this booth were thus $2,468[Ex. 574, p. 23].Costs for ventilating the ingot cooling area were based on the costs ofan isolated cooling chamber. The cost of such a chamber with a capacityof approximately 45,000 cfm is estimated to be $50,000 [Ex. 582-81]. Annualizedcosts are $5,875 based on a useful life of 20 years. (The 20 year periodreflects the structural nature of this control). Oandamp;M expenditures wouldbe $5,000. Total annual costs were thus estimated to be $10,875.Costs for isolation barriers and partitioning (which may include structuralor flexible materials) to prevent cross-contamination within the facilityare assumed to be $50,000. Annualized costs, computed using a 20 year usefullife, will be $5,875. (Since it was anticipated that the majority of thesecosts would be for structural materials, a 20 year useful life was usedto compute annualized capital costs). No operating cost was estimated tobe required.Additional costs for housekeeping were also estimated. An annual cleaning,which may be performed by a contractor, was estimated to cost $22,000 fora brass and bronze ingot facility [Ex. 686c, p. 32]. Costs for daily laborwere estimated to be $4,235, based on one man-hour per day at $12.10, 7days per week and 50 weeks per year.OSHA also estimated the costs for a portable vacuum sweeper. Costs wereestimated to be $3,900 each [Ex. 579, p. 29]. Annual costs, including annualizedcapital costs of $573 and Oandamp;M expenses, which include HEPA filter replacement,of $2,390, were estimated to be $2,963.The cost of the industrial hygiene survey was estimated to be $1,000, basedon one hygienist working for two days at $500 per day. The first day wouldbe required for a survey of the site and the second day would be requiredfor actual monitoring and for the evaluation of mechanical equipment. Recurringcosts were not estimated to be required; thus, no annual costs were estimated.Finally, costs for wind barriers and ventilation of dust packaging (orautomation, if necessary) at the baghouse are expected to be at least $75,000for facilities of this size [Ex. 668E]. Annual costs would be $18,510.Commenters indicated that the baseline level of control in the brass andbronze ingot sector is lower than the baseline assumed by Meridian (50%)in its August 1987 report [Ex. 574]. Other evidence suggests that the 50percent baseline may underestimate current compliance in this industry[Exs. 582-89, p. 35; 553-4; 583-48]. However, no information was submittedby industry that would allow OSHA to calculate a revised baseline. Thus,in calculating the average incremental costs for this sector it was assumedthat 50 percent of the controls needed were already in place.Meridian's annual cost estimate of $98,597 per plant was adjusted to includea scrap pre-heating system, two fresh air islands for furnace areas, ventilationof the ingot cooling area, dust packaging controls, isolation barriers,and housekeeping costs, which include costs for two portable vacuum sweepers.Since some plants may incur higher operating expenses in cold weather [Ex.582-89, p. 351], an increase in average operating expenses for ventilationof 2.5 percent of capital costs has also been added. The average incrementalannual cost estimate was thus $181,000 per plant.In sum, total incremental annual costs for this industry are estimatedto be approximately $2.9 million.<T3>Economic Feasibility. </T3>Price increases required to pass throughthe costs of compliance were estimated by computing the ratio of coststo sales. Sales for the brass and bronze ingot industry were estimatedby multiplying industry production by price.Industry production was estimated to be about 175,000 metric tons, or 386,000,000pounds, in 1986 [Ex. 582-85, Attachment] and the list price of leaded redbrass ingot (a major industry product) was about 75 cents per pound forthe same year [Ex. 574, p. 12A]. It was reported, however, that ingot israrely sold at the list price [Ex. 582-85, p. 23]. Assuming the sellingprice of this product to be 10 percent below its list, yields a price of67andCx.11; per pound. This price was then adjusted to 87andCx.11; per poundto reflect recent increases in ingot prices (see below). Industry saleswere thus estimated to be $336 million.Using this sales figure and the total incremental annual cost figure of$2.9 million, price increases were estimated. The cost/sales ratio indicatesthat average price increases of 0.9 percent will be required to pass throughthe costs of compliance.Alloyed brass ingot prices increased by more than 30 percent in 1988 [ProducerPrice Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, November, 1988]; production levelsalso increased somewhat during the same period, according to data fromthe Bureau of Mines. Since the users of ingot have the ability to performalloying on site, and since some have the ability to process scrap, theingot producers ability to raise prices is limited. (The 30 percent priceincrease in ingot noted above was paralleled by a 30 percent rise in theprice of refined copper and a 36 percent rise in the price of copper basescrap, the input of the ingot maker).Cost to profit ratios were also computed, and represented the impact uponprofits assuming full absorption of compliance costs. Profit estimateswere based on the sales figure developed above and the Dun and Bradstreetprofitability estimate of 1.7 percent for SIC 3341. Total profits for brassand bronze ingot activities were thus estimated to be $5.7 million. Toestimate profit impact, the tax-deductibility of compliance costs was takeninto account. That is, care was taken to compute before-tax profit beforesubtracting annual costs. After subtracting annual costs, the appropriateaverage tax rate was then reapplied to determine after-tax profit net ofcosts. For this sector, an average tax rate of 0.34 was used. Compliancecosts were found to represent 34 percent of industry profits. This impactwould result in a drop in ROS 0.6 percent, from 1.7 to 1.1 percent.However, OSHA estimates that roughly one-half of the firms in this sectorare engaged in activities other than the production of brass and bronzeingots. Available data indicate that these activities are profitable (seediscussion above) and firms should be able to absorb compliance costs fromoverall profits. Based on the average sales figure of $25 million and theROS rates presented in the industry profile, total profits per firm wereestimated to average $775,000. (This value was computed using an averageof the 1.7 and 4.6 ROS rates, or 3.2 percent.) Since the average cost perplant was estimated to be $181,000, the cost to profit ratio, using thesame tax considerations as described above, was 0.15. ROS would dip from3.2 percent to 2.6 percent. Normal rates of return on sales for firms inSIC 33 range from 3 to 3.5 percent.Annual costs as a percentage of fixed assets was also computed. Using financialdata from Dun and Bradstreet (Ex. 574, p. 31), and based on an averagesales figure of $21 million per plant, fixed assets for a brass and bronzeingot manufacturer were computed to be approximately $1.7 million. Sinceannual costs were estimated to be $181,000, annual costs as a percentageof fixed assets would be 10.6 percent. Historical data on capital expenditureswere not available for brass and bronze ingot manufacturers; therefore,OSHA examined data for SIC 3341. Capital investment as a percentage ofgross fixed assets for SIC 3341 averaged 11.5 percent over the fifteenyear period between 1963 and 1977 and was about 8.7 percent in 1982, accordingto Census data.OSHA recognizes that rates of return are modest for this sector. OSHA alsorecognizes that the brass and bronze ingot manufacturing industry has experienceda major contraction over the past twenty five years. Since the 1950's,thirty-two brass and bronze ingot plants have closed or have stopped producingingot (Ex. 582-85, p. 7). This contraction reflected the long term declinein the nonferrous foundries.It is clear, however, that demand for brass and bronze ingots will continue.This is evident from data which show, as noted above, that in 1987, 66percent of copper materials consumed at U.S. foundries consisted of ingots(Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of Interior). All 1,300 foundries usebrass and bronze ingots as raw material. Data from the Commerce Departmentindicate that production of copper-based castings has increased substantiallysince the recession of the early 1980s and now approximates 1979 levels(1989 U.S. Industrial Outlook, U.S. Department of Commerce. p. 18-13).While OSHA estimates that some brass, bronze, and copper foundries willexit the casting market over the next five years, total casting productionis expected to remain constant. Demand for ingots will shift away fromfoundries which cease production and shift to foundries which remain inbusiness. Total nonferrous foundry demand for the brass and bronze ingotsis expected to remain constant throughout this shift. No decline in productionfor any brass and bronze ingot manufacturer is expected to occur. Currentlyeach ingot manufacturer supplies, on average, over 80 individual foundries.This large number of buyers should ameliorate the potential disruptionfrom the consolidation in demand.Based on the computed profit impact ratios, evidence of recent demand foringots, and evidence that demand for ingots will continue, this analysisindicates that this sector should be able to withstand the impacts of thisrule with an extended schedule of five years. The five year schedule isrequired due to the limited ability of firms in this sector to raise pricesand to allow firms to phase in engineering controls.OSHA concludes that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL is economically feasible forthe brass and bronze ingot manufacturers. At the end of the five year period,profit impacts are not expected to be of sufficient magnitude to threatenindustry existence or structure. Further, evidence of domestic demand foringots, as indicated by recent product price rises and increases in productionvolume, strongly suggests that some plants will be able to expand salesand improve profitability.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Independent Battery Breaking</ITAG><T3>Process Description. </T3>Independent battery breakers process usedbatteries to recover lead for sale to secondary smelters. Although independentbattery breaking facilities do not engage in secondary lead smelting operations,independent battery breakers do utilize the same battery breaking processand production technology as captive battery breakers in secondary leadsmelters, an industry segment in which OSHA has found it feasible to achievea PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controls.In both industry segments, batteries are broken or cracked to separate,recycle, and/or dispose of the various materials of which they are composed.Those components include hard and soft lead, lead oxide/sulfate and salts,sulfuric acid, paper or plastic cell separators, and rubber or polypropyleneencasing materials (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-1; 605).Independent battery breakers process various kinds of batteries, includingautomotive, junk, odd-size, damaged, small lot and sometimes large industrialbatteries. On the other hand, generally captive battery breakers processonly automotive batteries (Ex. 694-1, p. 2). However, Delatte Metals Company(Delatte), an independent battery breaker that recently acquired a smelterand is now classified as a secondary smelter, still handles large industrialbatteries in its battery breaking facility (Ex. 687-13).Many battery breaking operations are automated, (e.g., sawing, dumping,crushing, shredding) (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-7; 686F, p. 6). However, at somefacilities, dumping the cells and loading the washed lead cells for shipmentto smelters may also be performed manually. In addition, unloading automotivebatteries and cutting large industrial batteries are performed manually.In a typical battery breaking operation, employees unload batteries fromtrucks onto roller conveyors which carry the batteries to the cutting saw.At Ashland Metals Company (Ashland), for example, the conveyor system automaticallyturns batteries on their side to go through the saw. Low-speed saws (40rpm), with blade dimensions of approximately 1 inch by 36 inches, typicallyare used to cut off the tops of battery cases (Ex. 583-52, p. 3). To cutbatteries, Ashland, Delatte and the Battery Salvage Division of Ace Battery,Inc. (Ace) all use low-speed saws, which generate less lead oxide dust(Exs. 583-52, p. 3; 694-1, p. 11; 687-13). Battery tops may also be cutoff using high-speed saws, guillotines and shears, or the whole batterymay be crushed in a hammermill or shredder. Cutting batteries with high-speedsaws and guillotines scatters more lead dust, so these production methodsmay result in greater exposure levels (Ex. 694-1, p. 11).After passing through the saw, the battery top drops below the saw andthe case, which contains the cells and other lead-bearing materials, continueson the conveyor to the dumping station (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-1; 694-1, pp.3-4) and uses manual shakeout to dump the internal components from batteries(Ex. 687-1), while Ace and Delatte utilize automatic dumping equipmentto separate the cases from the cells (Exs. 583-52, p. 1; 694-1, p. 3).An automatic dumper, also called a tumbler, consists of a stainless steelrotating drum that receives the batteries as they are discharged from theconveyor. By the action of stainless steel bars within the tumbler drum,the tumbler separates the case from the ``groups'' or cells, which consistof hard lead grids covered by a paste of lead oxide/sulfate. The groupsdrop through the slots in the tumbler and are deposited into product collectionbins. Typically, front end loaders remove the groups from the dumping areafor shipment to lead smelters (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-1; 583-52, p. 3; 694-1).The empty battery cases, both tops and bottoms, are often further processedto recover additional lead oxides and polypropylene. The cases are conveyedfrom the tumbler or moved by a front-end loader to a crusher, called ahammermill. At this point the tops are merged with the cases for crushing.The hammermill grinds the cases and tops, while the batteries are sprayedwith water (Exs. 583-52, p. 3; 694-1, p. 7).Lead oxide/sulfate is removed from the crushed pieces by various methods.In one method, the crushed pieces are washed and lead oxides and residuefrom the wastewater treatment are collected and placed into the groupspile for shipment. In another method, the slurry of crushed pieces andwater moves through a series of screw conveyors to settling tanks to separatethe plastic and rubber from the lead oxide/sulfate. The materials are separatedby gravity separation, called a sink/float process. In this process thelead-bearing materials sink to the bottom of the settling tanks and areremoved by conveyors while the crushed case pieces remain afloat and areskimmed off the tank surface (Ex. 605).Entire batteries may also be processed by crushing, which generates muchless dust than sawing. One method involves feeding whole batteries intoa heavy-duty hammermill. After the battery is crushed, the lead materials,plastic, rubber and acid are separated from each other by the sink/floatprocess (Ex. 605, p. 4).Batteries may also be crushed using an automated shredder, such as theSaturn Shredder. The operating principle of the Saturn Shredder is thehigh torque and low-speed revolution of two counter-rotating shafts, eachequipped with stainless steel teeth, to slowly shred whole batteries intopieces. No hammering, pounding, ripping, or other high-energy breakingforce is employed, as is done with the hammermill (Ex. 592); thus the Saturnshredder generates less dust than sawing or crushing in a hammermill.Large industrial batteries, because of their size and steel casing, aremanually broken. These batteries, weighing from several hundred poundsto several tons, consist of a dozen or more closed plastic cells containedin a large steel casing. First the steel casing is cut and removed witha torch, a pneumatic cutting device or a hand-held gas-powered saw. Thenthe lead-bearing materials are recovered from the cells (called ``jars''in an industrial battery) through the processes described above or thecells can be broken by either a saw or hand axe (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-2; 605,p. 4; 687-1).<T3>Sources of Exposure.</T3> While the data are unclear, it appears thatthere are at least two independent battery breaking facilities and possiblyas many as 12 facilities in operation currently, with each facility havinga maximum of 10 lead-exposed employees. Thus, the independent battery breakingindustry and total lead-exposed workforce is very small (Exs. 694-1, pp.1, 4).Because of the small size of independent battery breakers, such as Ace,employees perform various tasks interchangeably and therefore all employeespotentially may be exposed to lead. However, since many battery breakingoperations are automated and enclosed or performed with wet controls, theydo not pose high lead exposure problems (Exs. 583-52, p. 1; 694-1). JACAreported back in 1982 that ordinarily sawing and dumping operations werealready automated and enclosed, and therefore that employees are not exposedto lead while these operations are in process (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-7). In thosefew cases where automated processing equipment has not been enclosed, employeeexposure levels may be high for employees working in close proximity tothe equipment (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-7).Generally, employee exposure problems are limited to tasks that are performedmanually (Ex. 605; p. 3). In processing automotive batteries, manual tasksgenerally are limited to unloading used batteries as they enter the facilityand to loading cleaned and wetted cells for delivery to secondary smelters(Exs. 583-52, p. 3; 694-1, p. 2-3). However, at Ashland the groups aremanually dumped from the battery cases after the top is sawed off (Ex.687-1).Unloading batteries generally does not result in high exposure levels sincemost automotive batteries arrive at battery breaking facilities ``wet''(i.e., still containing the sulfuric acid electrolytes). This conditioncan aid in reducing air lead levels associated with battery breaking. Somejunk automotive batteries, such as factory rejects or drained batteries,may be received ``dry'' (i.e., lead-bearing grids have dried). When batteriesare handled dry (e.g., manual unloading, manual dumping), the dried leadoxide/sulfate may become airborne and employee exposure may be greater(Ex. 605).Loading the washed lead cells for delivery also does not pose exposureproblems where the cells are kept wet. At Delatte even large industrialbatteries are loaded and shipped wet (Ex. 687-13). In addition, at someindependent battery breaking facilities manual loading has been replacedwith loading by front-end loaders (Ex. 583-52, p. 3).In processing large industrial batteries, the sources of high lead exposureare manually cutting the steel casing off of the battery and manually breakingand dumping the cells from the battery. Cutting off the tops of large industrialbatteries may result in potentially high exposure levels because workerswielding cutting devices such as torches can only be separated from thelead acid and mist generated by their action by approximately three feet(Exs. 553-7, p. 1-12; 668F). Employee exposure to lead from manually breakingand processing the cells is eliminated if they are processed in the automatedand enclosed automotive battery breaking equipment.Processing of large industrial batteries and resulting lead exposure appearsto be only intermittent. A task is considered to be intermittent if itis not performed every day or if it is not performed continuously throughouta shift. Both forms of intermittency are compounded in the processing oflarge industrial batteries. For example, a consultant for Ashland, MarthaJ. Guimond, of Joseph A. Guimond andamp; Associates, Inc., stated that ``thecutting of large industrial batteries [is] not done every day, but [is]scheduled as there [are] enough batteries to cut for about one to two hours''(Ex. 668F, letter dated Jan. 5, 1988). In addition, Delatte, which hadthe highest battery breaking capacity in 1988 when it was part of thissector, reports that it ``only occasionally handles industrial batteries''(Ex. 687-13).In addition to exposures connected to certain specific manual operations,employees may also be exposed to lead dust when movement of heavy equipmentor local truck and forklift traffic causes spilled and dried lead oxide/sulfateto become airborne (Ex. 605).<T3>Exposure Date. </T3>An overview of existing exposure levels revealsthat by 1986 one independent battery breaking facility, Ashland, alreadywas controlling exposure levels to or close to 50 mg/m\3\ in all operations.The most recent data (1986) from Ashland show that the overall arithmeticaverage exposure was 51 mg/m\3\ that one-half of the sampling results werebelow 50 mg/m\3\, and that 83% of the results were below 56 mg/m\3\. Indeed,at Ashland in 1986 no sampling result was above 63 mg/m\3\.A second independent battery breaker, Ace, also submitted some personaland area monitoring results for 1985-87. For reasons set out below, OSHAbelieves the Ace data have only limited use in determining technologicalfeasibility, and the Agency relies on these data only to confirm OSHA'sconclusions drawn from its analysis of the Ashland data. For example, theoverall average for Ace's most recent personal monitoring results (61.7mg/m\3\) is consistent with the most recent monitoring results at Ashland.In addition, at Delatte, which is now classified as a secondary lead smelterwith a captive battery breaking operation, the president reported thatpreviously the company had controlled exposure levels to 50 mg/m\3\ andhad ``no trouble'' meeting a PEL of 50 mg/m\3\, even in industrial batterybreaking (Ex. 687-13) Other captive battery breaking operations also arecontrolling exposures to or below 50 mg/m\3\ solely by means of engineeringand work practice controls (Tr. 175, 192).The exposure data in the record include three data sets: data from Ashland,submitted by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) (Ex. 582-88,App. C; Tables 1 and 2, below); data submitted by Ace (Ex. 694-1, App.A; Table 3, below); and summary data included in the JACA report (Ex. 553-7;Table 4, below). In general, these data sets tend to be incomplete regardingmonitoring results, job categories, and associated control information.However, in combination with other information in the record, the Ashlandand JACA data and the submissions from Delatte, Ace, and the Battery RecyclingAssociation (BRA) provide sufficient evidence to allow OSHA to assess thetechnological feasibility of achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in thisindustry sector. The first data set is from Ashland (see Tables 1 and 2, below). The mostrecent data from Ashland shows that by 1986 exposure levels in all operationswere already at or only slightly above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The overall arithmeticaverage in 1986 was 51 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the highest sample result wasonly 63 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Even in the battery chopping operation, for example,which involves the manual cutting of large industrial batteries and whichindustry maintains is the most difficult operation in which to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, the average exposure level was 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Twoof three employees in that operation were exposed below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,and the remaining one was only exposed to 63 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s100,11</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Exposure Data for Ashland Metals Company, </T4>1986 <H1>Job title</H1><H1>8-hour TWA (andCx.18;g/m\3\)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Large loader/cutter <D>\1\56 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Large loader/chopper <D>\1\48 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Battery chopper <D>40 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do. <D>63 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do. <D>48 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rubber room (hammermill) <D>53</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Overall average <D>51 </D><F>\1\ OSHA had to calculate 8-hour TWAs for some of the individual monitoringresults. OSHA calculated the 8-hour TWAs using two assumptions: (1) Thatthe employee was not exposed to any lead during the remainder of the shift,and (2) that the employee was exposed to the same concentration of leadduring the unsampled time as during the sampled time. OSHA then took themidpoint of this range to represent the employee's full-shift exposure.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The 1986 Ashland data are significantly lower than the 1985 data. In 1985,the overall average exposure was 103 andCx.18;g/m\3\; only three operationshad average exposures at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table 2, below).In addition, only 26% of the sampling results were at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,while 64% of the samples were below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The improvement from 1985 to 1986 is most apparent by comparing similaroperations. For example, in 1985 large industrial battery cutter/loaderaccounted for a majority of sample results above 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ andhad an average exposure level of 359 andCx.18;g/m\3\, while in 1986 the averagefor this operation was 52 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA notes that during 1985-86Ashland implemented a special ventilation system and modified the cuttingtorch to reduce exposure levels for the industrial battery cutter (Ex.668F). The 1986 data appear to indicate that these controls have been successfulin significantly reducing the exposure levels of industrial battery cutters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s75,9</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4> Summary Exposure Data for Ashland Metals Company, </T4>1985 <H1>Job title</H1><H1>Avg. exp. levels (andCx.18;g/m\3\, 8-hr.

OSHA calculated the 8-hour TWAs using two assumptions: (1) Thatthe employee was not exposed to any lead during the remainder of the shift,and (2) that the employee was exposed to the same concentration of leadduring the unsampled time as during the sampled time. OSHA then took themidpoint of this range to represent the employee's full-shift exposure.</F></ITAG></ITAG>An industry consultant, Martha Guimond, argues that Ashland's 1986 dataare not representative of the exposure levels of employees at this facilitybecause production levels were greatly reduced in 1986 because the companyhad made a decision to cease battery breaking production. Guimond arguesthat the low exposure levels in most operations in 1986 are due to lowproduction levels since the only engineering controls implemented duringthat time were limited to the industrial battery cutting area (Ex. 668F,p. 1).For several reasons OSHA does not believe that lower production levelssolely account for the lower exposure levels in 1986.First, the most recent exposure data from Ace and information from Delatteand the Battery Recycling Association (BRA) indicate that low exposurelevels are currently being achieved at other facilities (Exs. 583-52; 687-13;694-1) (see discussion of data and information below).Second, other information in the record submitted by industry appears toindicate that increased production levels are not necessarily correlatedwith higher exposure levels. For example, when Delatte was still an independentbattery breaker, it had the highest volume of batteries per day (18,000)of any independent breaker; yet the plant had ``no trouble'' controllingexposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 583-52, p. 3).Third, most facilities respond to lower production levels by reducing thenumber of their employees or by operating fewer shifts. As a result itis reasonable to assume that the employees who continue to work are dealingwith approximately the same sources of emissions and exposure levels asin the past. For these reasons, OSHA believes that the 1986 Ashland dataare representative of current exposure levels at that facility and in theindustry in general.A second data set was submitted by the Battery Salvage Division of AceBattery, Inc. (Ex. 694-1, App. A). For several reasons, OSHA believes thatthese data, which include results from both personal and area sampling,have only limited utility. First, the personal sampling data are not brokendown according to job categories. Second, the most recent data, from 1987,were obtained exclusively by area sampling, which is not necessarily agood indication of employee exposure levels. Nonetheless, if, as OSHA assumes,Ace was following good industrial hygiene principles and sampling areaswhere air lead levels were likely to be highest, that data may have somevalue as a conservative indication of employee exposures. In any event,OSHA does not rely on the Ace data as an independent source of analysisbut uses it only to broadly confirm Agency conclusions derived from othersources.Like the data from Ashland, the Ace data show a reduction in exposure levelssince 1985. For example, in 1985, the plant-wide average exposure levelobtained from personal sampling was 247 mg/m\3\ with none of the personalsample results below 50 mg/m\3\. By 1986, that average had been reducedto 62 mg/m\3\, and 40% of the personal sample results were below 50 mg/m\3\.Similar reductions were reflected in area sampling results between 1985-87.Other information in the record also corroborates OSHA's analysis of theAshland data. Delatte, according to its company president, has had no difficultycontrolling exposure levels to below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 687-13). Moreover,according to Lee Norman, of BRA, generally across the industry employeesperforming manual unloading of batteries, operating front-end loaders toload the washed cells for shipment and monitoring the battery tipping processon the sawing conveyor all typically have exposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 583-52, p. 3; see Table 3).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s80,r20</C><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Typical Exposure Levels in Independent Battery Breaking Operations,Battery Recycling Association</T4><H1>Job Title </H1><H1>Average exposure level (</H1>mg/m\3\ 8-hr TWA)<ITAG tagnum="1">Truck unloaders (manual) <D>10-20 </D>mg/m\3\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conveyor monitor, tipper <D>10-20 </D>mg/m\3\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Front-end loader (loading) <D>30-50 </D>mg/m\3\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cleanup (vacuum sweeper) <D>40-50 </D>mg/m\3\ <F>Source: (Ex. 583-52, p 3).</F></ITAG></ITAG>Furthermore, OSHA's expert witness Mr. Mel Cassady, who has been in 50-75%of all secondary lead smelters, testified that most captive battery breakingoperations in those smelters are controlling employee exposure levels toor below 50 mg/m\3\ in most operations most of the time by means of engineeringand work practice controls (Tr. 175, 192). Mr. Cassady also testified thatthere was nothing to indicate that it would be technologically more difficultto achieve 50 mg/m\3\ in independent battery breaking than in captive batterybreaking operations (Tr. 189).The final data set is from the 1982 JACA report (Ex. 553-7). That reportdoes not provide any raw sampling data on air lead levels in independentbattery breakers. Rather, the report provides estimated ranges of typicalexposure levels in various operations when no controls are in place andestimated resulting exposure levels after controls have been implementedin those operations. The report also contains an estimate of the totalnumber of lead-exposed employees in the industry, 140, nearly all of whomJACA believes were exposed above 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-11). Withoutindividual monitoring results and other information, the JACA report hasonly limited utility in assessing current exposure levels. Moreover, theseestimates, OSHA believes, are too high, because they are predicated onthe counter-factual assumption of zero controls.<T3>Current Controls. </T3>OSHA's discussion of current exposure levelsin the previous section indicates that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ already is beingachieved or is close to being achieved in many operations by independentbattery breaking facilities and in most operations by captive battery breakingoperations in secondary lead smelters. The primary methods currently usedto control air lead levels in independent battery breaking are wet controlsand automation and enclosure of processing equipment. Ashland and Delatteare controlling exposure levels through a combination of wet process technologyand automating and enclosing equipment, while Ace appears to have generallyachieved employee exposure levels only ``somewhat above * * * 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\''primarily by the use of wet control technology (Ex. 694-1, pp. 4, 6, 7,8).<T3>Automation and Enclosure. </T3>In order to meet Environmental ProtectionAgency regulations and to increase productivity, several battery breakingfacilities have chosen to replace manual operations, where there may bepotentially high exposure levels and contamination of the environment,with automated and enclosed shredding and recycling equipment (Ex. 576,p. 3). When process equipment is enclosed and automated it reduces employeeexposure to lead by preventing employees from coming into direct contactwith lead oxide/sulfate dust generated during processing of the battery.At least by 1982, high speed saws and automated dumping operations at independentbattery breakers already were ordinarily enclosed (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-7).Automation and enclosure can have a dramatic effect on employee exposurelevels by allowing employees to distance themselves from the sources oflead emissions. For example, JACA reported that when dumping (shakeout)components was performed manually and controls were not in use, exposurelevels ranged from 150-500 andCx.18;g/m\3\. However, when dumping is automatedand enclosed, JACA estimates that exposure levels can be controlled tobelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-7, pp. 1-8, 1-12). Similarly, at Delatte,where sawing, dumping and crushing equipment are automated and enclosed,the company reports that it has no trouble controlling exposure levelsto below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 687-13).<T3>Wet Controls. </T3>Some independent battery breakers control exposurelevels throughout their facilities primarily by use of wet controls. Themost common practice is either to keep the entire work area wet with wateror to keep the lead oxide wet with recycled battery acid (Ex. 553-7, p.1-7). Ace practices wet control by spraying and maintaining the wet conditionof the entire battery breaking area (Ex. 694-1, p. 7). To control employeeexposure levels in the battery cutting area, Ashland uses a wet system.Ashland also uses a water spray system in the hammermill to keep air leadlevels low (Ex. 583-52, p. 3).<T3>Maintenance and Housekeeping. </T3>Lead oxide/sulfate that is spilledand allowed to dry may become airborne due to agitation and vibration fromfront-end loaders and other local traffic or due to dry sweeping of thearea. Typically, independent battery breakers clean these spills by wetsweeping, squeegeeing, and vacuuming (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-7; 583-52. p. 3).<T3>Work Practices. </T3>Industry has not provided much specific informationon what work practice controls are currently used in this industry. Acereports that it utilizes various work practice controls to reduce employeeexposure levels. For example, Ace trains employees in precision handlingof materials through proper use of equipment (Ex. 694-1, p. 7). In addition,Ashland reports that it trains its employees in the appropriate work practices(Ex. 668F, letter dated June 8, 1987).In addition to these general control methods, independent battery breakersuse the following controls operation by operation.<T3>Unloading. </T3>Unloading whole batteries from delivery trucks, eventhough performed manually at some facilities, is typically controlled tobelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ because the batteries are received wet and do notgenerate lead oxide/sulfate dust as they are being moved (Exs. 553-7, p.1-8; 583-52, p. 3). Employee exposures are maintained this low in partbecause batteries are usually unloaded onto conveyors that feed the saw,so unloaders are separated from that potential source of cross contaminationby the length of the conveyor.<T3>Sawing/Cutting. </T3>Ashland and Ace both control exposure levels inthe cutting and sawing operation by using automated low-speed saws (40rpm) to cut off the tops of batteries (Exs. 687-1, 694-1, p. 11). Low-speedsaws emit less lead dust and acid mist than high-speed saws or guillotines,and thus are associated with lower air lead levels (Ex. 605, pp. 3, 4).In 1982 JACA reported that there was a 20-fold difference in the exposurelevels in cutting batteries with low-speed rather than high-speed sawseven if no other controls are used. Without controls, cutting with low-speedsaws typically results in air lead levels of 50-100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ whilecutting with high-speed saws generates exposure levels of 1,000-2,000 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8). Delatte also controls employee exposure levels below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in cutting and sawing in part by using low-speed saws(Ex. 687-13).In addition to controlling employee exposure levels by automating the cuttingprocess with low-speed saws, some independent battery breakers have furtherreduced exposure levels by enclosing or ventilating the low-speed saw (Exs.553-7, p. 1-7; 605, p. 3). Ace has not enclosed or ventilated its low-speedsaw and conveyor system (Ex. 694-1, p. 5).Battery breaking facilities also control exposure levels in cutting andsawing by keeping the batteries wet. For example, Delatte keeps employeeexposures low in this area by maintaining the entire process wet (Ex. 687-13).Ace also uses a water spray system in the cutting area to maintain thewet condition of the batteries (Ex. 694-1, p. 7).Finally, Ace has controlled employee exposure levels in the battery tippingoperation, which precedes sawing, by automating that operation as well.Automation of the tipping process reduces exposures to 10-20 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 583-52, p. 3). According to JACA, even manually tipping batterieswithout controls results in typical air lead levels of only 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8).<T3>Dumping. </T3>Most independent battery breaking facilities controlexposure levels in dumping of the lead-bearing cells from battery casesby automating and enclosing this operation. Both Ace and Delatte have automateddumping equipment, however Ace indicates that its dumping equipment isnot enclosed or ventilated (Ex. 694-1, p. 5). Ashland still uses manualshakeout of cells from battery cases (Ex. 687-1). <T3>Crushing and Separating. </T3>Independent battery breakers controlemployee exposure in crushing operations primarily by enclosing the crusher(hammermill) and using water spray systems to maintain the batteries wet.Ace and Ashland both control exposure levels in this operation with waterspray systems. Ace's water spray system also washes off lead residue fromthe crushed battery cases so there is little exposure to lead when thecrushed cases are loaded for shipment (Ex. 694-1, p. 3). Some independent battery breakers have replaced cutting off battery topswith crushing whole batteries in a hammermill or shredder, which has theresult of reducing employee exposure levels because sources of exposureassociated with tipping, cutting and dumping batteries are eliminated (Exs.553-7, p. 1-3; 605. p. 2). Those sources of exposure can be significantwhen batteries are manually tipped and dumped (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-2; 605,p. 2). After whole batteries or battery cases are crushed, some independent batterybreakers separate leaded cells and lead oxide residue from battery casepieces by a sink/float process (Ex. 605, p. 3-4). From the viewpoint ofexposure control, the wet nature of this process itself is the key control.The lead-bearing materials sink to the bottom of the settling tank andare still wet when moved to collection bins or loaded onto trucks for shipment.When the groups are saturated with water, lead dust is not generated (Ex.605, p. 4). The sink/float process also effectively reduces exposure levelsin certain downstream operations because lead oxide is washed off of thebattery case pieces during this process. Thus, when employees load thecase pieces for shipment, they are not exposed to lead. <T3>Loading. </T3>Some independent battery breakers have controlled exposurelevels by replacing manual loading of washed cells and cases on trucksfor shipment with loading by front-end loaders. Ace states that it loadsthe washed groups for shipment with front-end loaders because the saturatedgroups do not move well on conveyors (Ex. 694-1, p. 12). Where loadingis done with front-end loaders, typical air lead levels are between 30-50andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 583-52, p. 3). <T3>Large Industrial Batteries. </T3>In processing large industrial batteriesthe steel casings are removed manually by a worker holding a gas torchor a pneumatic cutter (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-2). To reduce exposure levels duringthis task Ashland has implemented a ventilation system and modified thecutting torch (Ex. 668F, pp. 3-4). Some independent battery breakers have eliminated exposures associatedwith manually breaking the cells with saws or hand axes by processing thecells in the facility's automotive battery breaking equipment (Ex. 553-7,p. 1-2). In addition, in order to control exposure levels generated fromthe lead oxide in the industrial battery cells, Delatte loads and shipsthe cells wet (Ex. 687-13). <T3>Additional Controls._Overview_ </T3>With the existing controls describedin the previous section, OSHA has found that one former and two currentindependent battery breaking facilities already have achieved 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in many operations and many captive battery breakers have achieved thatlevel in most operations. With the additional controls recommended by OSHAimplemented, the Agency anticipates that exposure levels will be controlledbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations, except perhaps the task of manuallycutting the steel cases of industrial batteries. OSHA's analysis of the record in the previous sections indicates that by1986 Ashland had achieved air lead levels close to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in almost all operations through a combination of wet process technology,automation of equipment and enclosure. Ace has achieved low exposure levelsin almost all operations primarily by wet process technology and work practices.OSHA concludes from these data and information on current controls thata limited number of additional controls are needed to consistently maintainexposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at these two facilities inevery operation except industrial battery cutting. OSHA also notes thatDelatte has achieved 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations, including industrialbattery breaking, with the same or similar combination of controls.  On the whole, the same sorts of readily available, conventional controlsthat have successfully reduced exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in Delatte's facility and in many captive battery breaking operations areprecisely the kinds of additional controls that OSHA recommends to otherindependent battery breakers to reduce employee air lead levels to below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. These engineering controls consist primarily of enclosureand automation of process equipment, improvement in ventilation systems,enclosure of conveyor systems, use of low-speed saws, use of low-energyshredders and installation of additional water spray systems. OSHA believes that most independent battery breakers will not need to implementall of these recommended additional controls to control exposure levelsbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Some independent battery breakers should be ableto consistently control exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ solely byimproving work practices and keeping the batteries and work area wet. Iffurther additional controls are needed, independent battery breakers maybe able to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementing simple enclosure andisolation techniques such as enclosing the cabs of mobile equipment orenclosing automated equipment. OSHA's discussion of additional controls and expected reductions in airlead levels relies in part upon OSHA's independent analysis of processesand controls in captive battery breaking operations in secondary lead smelting,an industry sector for which the court has already found it feasible tomeet a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practicecontrols. For several reasons OSHA believes this reliance to be reasonable.First, the production processes utilized by captive battery breakers arevirtually identical to those in use in independent facilities and captiveoperations are controlling exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ usingconventional rather than ``unique'' technology. For example, Delatte isachieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ with the same production and controltechnology it used as an independent facility. As such, there is nothingto suggest that the control technologies employed by captive operationswould not be directly applicable and transferrable to independent facilities.Second, as Mr. Cassady points out, on the average, captive battery breakingoperations and independent battery breakers are about the same size; twoto five employees in captive operations and five employees in independentfacilities (Tr. 190). Delatte, which was an independent battery breakeruntil 1988, employs approximately the same number of workers in its captivefacility as does Ashland. Consequently, OSHA agrees with Mr. Cassady thatthere is nothing about battery breaking in an independent facility thatwould make it technologically more difficult to control exposure levelsbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ than it is in a battery breaking operation in asecondary smelter (Tr. 189-98).Before discussing additional controls specifically, OSHA notes that thefirst step any company should take to systematically reduce exposure levelsis to conduct an industrial hygiene survey that includes an in-depth job/taskanalysis, plant-wide survey and identification of sources of emission ineach task and area. For some independent battery breakers it may be clearwhat the exposure problems are and how those problems can be remedied.These facilities may be able, without extensive surveying, to go througha series of controls and identify the more or less easy and inexpensivecontrols which may be sufficient to achieve exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Still other facilities may need an industrial hygiene study in order todevelop an integrated system of controls that will consistently controlexposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. <T3>Wet Controls. </T3>Independent battery breakers may be able to controlexposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in every operation except industrialbattery cutting by implementing or improving water spray systems for allequipment and conveyor systems and utilizing other wet control techniquesto maintain the wet condition of the batteries at all times. For example,Delatte states it has had no trouble controlling exposure levels below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ because it keeps the batteries wet (Ex. 687-1). Ace, whichalso relies primarily on wet control technology, reported that its exposurelevels were only somewhat above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 694-1, p. 4). Inaddition, Ace states that wet control technology is the most effectivecontrol system for independent battery breakers. Since batteries are alreadysaturated with water and sulfuric acid, little additional water is necessaryto maintain the wet condition of the battery (Ex. 694-1, p. 9). In addition to installing water spray systems on all equipment, there areother simple wet control methods that independent battery breakers shouldimplement. For example, wetting cracked or damaged batteries that havelost their electrolytes will prevent leaded plates from drying out anddispersing lead oxide into the air during unloading and loading. To theextent practicable groups should be loaded and shipped wet, as is doneat Delatte (Ex. 687-13). In addition, floors and other surfaces shouldbe kept wet to suppress dust and to prevent spilled lead oxide from dryingand becoming airborne. Finally, floors and surfaces throughout the plantshould be wet mopped or squeegeed as often as necessary, but not less thanonce per shift (Ex. 605). <T3>Automation and Enclosure/Isolation. </T3>To the extent that wet controltechnology cannot reduce exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in alloperations, automation of process equipment and enclosure of process andmobile equipment should be implemented to control exposure levels to below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Some battery breakers who have automated and/or enclosedequipment have achieved significant reductions in exposure levels (Ex.583-52; see discussion, above, under Current Controls). Although automation alone may not reduce exposure levels in every operation,some battery breakers have dramatically reduced exposure levels simplyby automating various processes. For example, Delatte has eliminated exposurelevels associated with battery tipping by automating that process (Ex.583-52, p. 1). In addition, General Battery Corporation (GBC), a captivebattery breaker, has reduced its exposure levels by more than 50% by installingautomated process equipment (Ex. 592). Where automation alone does not sufficiently reduce employee exposure levels,automated equipment used in cutting, dumping and crushing operations shouldbe enclosed to reduce exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For example,in shakeout Ashland should be able to control exposure levels below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ by replacing manual shakeout with automated, enclosed andventilated dumping equipment. JACA reported back in 1982 this combinationof controls would reduce exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in dumpingoperations. In addition, JACA reported that enclosing high-speed saws,which had exposure levels of 1,000-2,000 andCx.18;g/m\3\, would reduce typicalair lead levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8). Enclosinglow-speed saws would also result in substantial reductions. Ace has automated but not enclosed its automotive battery processing equipment.Ace contends that it cannot enclose its equipment or conveyor because toomany adjustments would be required for odd-sized batteries. However, whenDelatte was an independent battery breaker, the company implemented state-of-the-artautomated and enclosed equipment to process various sizes of batteriesand has successfully controlled exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Ace has not explained why it would be technologically infeasible for thecompany to implement the same sorts of automation and enclosure employedby Delatte and other battery breakers. Finally, one of the simplest methods to isolate employees from lead emissionsthat should be implemented by independent battery breakers is to provideall mobile equipment operators with enclosed cabs equipped with HEPA filtersand tempered air. This control technology is readily available and in usein other industries. <T3>Ventilation. </T3>OSHA believes that in many battery breaking operations,including industrial battery cutting, implementing or improving ventilationcan achieve major reductions in exposure levels. Such controls have beendeveloped, tested and, where found effective, manufactured and appliedwidely for many years throughout industry to control specific contaminants.The ventilation controls applicable to captive battery breaking are thesame as those applicable to independent battery breaking. Implementing or improving ventilation can achieve major reductions in airlead levels in even the most difficult operations to control, such as industrialbattery cutting. At Ashland use of a special ventilation system to pushthe fume away from the industrial battery cutter's breathing zone significantlyreduced the operator's exposure level (Ex. 668F, p. 1). In 1986, Ashlandalso reported that it was working with exhaust system manufacturers todevelop an exhaust system that is actually part of the industrial batterycutting torch. As indicated in OSHA's discussion in other areas of this preamble and incorporatedhere by reference, it is imperative that improvements to existing ventilationand newly-installed ventilation be properly designed, installed and maintained.<T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices and preventive maintenance are critically important controlsin independent battery breaking (Tr. 176), whose importance frequentlyis not adequately recognized by employers. Failure to develop and use rigoroushousekeeping, good work practices and preventive maintenance can destroythe effectiveness of otherwise adequate engineering controls.Meticulous housekeeping is essential to ensure that exposure levels areconsistently controlled below 50 mg/m\3\. To the extent that any independentbattery breaker still relies upon dry sweeping in some operations, thatpractice should be eliminated and should be replaced by vacuum sweepingor wetting and squeegeeing spilled material to prevent the reentrainmentof lead oxides (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-7; Ex. 694-1). Equipment should be washeddown daily, as GBC does, to control exposure levels (Ex. 592). Batteriesshould be stored on paved platforms or yards so that the surface can beeasily washed down.Preventive maintenance of battery breaking equipment should consist ofdaily inspection and cleaning. Sharpening saw blades and lubricating equipmentbearings regularly are all part of a proper maintenance program.Implementing appropriate work practice controls is also vital to achievingexposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\ and to reducing exposure levels for industrialbattery cutters. For example, Ashland reports that industrial battery cuttersmust be trained to properly position gas torches in a manner so that thefume flows away from the clean air stream or the efficiency of this ventilationsystem will be reduced (Ex. 668F, p. 2). It also is important to trainmaintenance workers who must enter enclosed areas, where exposures maybe high, to not enter these areas more frequently than is necessary.Ace asserts that work practices cannot be improved because it would decreaseproductivity and because there would be significant resistance among employeesto improving work practices.Specifically, Ace argues that there would be resistance among employeesbecause of additional training and concentration required for precisionhandling of equipment. Also, Ace argues that the educational level of itsemployees is not compatible with precision training. Ace, however, providesno evidence to support its assertion that work habits cannot be changedand poor work practices cannot be corrected. OSHA considers Ace's viewunacceptable, especially since it is likely to become a self-fulfillingprophecy. OSHA, along with the industrial hygiene community, believes thatgood work practices should be taught to workers and retaught as often asnecessary. If the work practices are sensible and the company communicatesto workers its seriousness in requiring that such work practices be followed,OSHA has no doubt that workers will follow them. No matter what effortsa company may make to implement effective engineering controls, if itswork practices are poor those controls are likely to be rendered ineffective.OSHA also recommends the following controls operation by operation.<T3>Unloading. </T3>Unloading of batteries from delivery trucks can beaccomplished by various methods: manually, with mobile equipment or byautomation. Currently some independent battery breakers, including Ashlandand Ace, manually unload batteries from delivery trucks and place themon conveyors that go to the sawing area. BRA reports that typical exposurelevels for manual unloading already are below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 583-52, p.3). To the extent that exposure levels may exceed 50 mg/m\3\, unloadingcan either be automated or, as discussed above, controlled by enclosingcabs of mobile equipment used for unloading.One method of automating unloading would be to implement an automated conveyorsystem. The use of conveyors rather than front-end loaders to move brokenbattery scrap not only would reduce lead dust, but also would increaseproduction efficiency by requiring less manpower and allowing faster unloadingof batteries (Ex. 592, p. 33). GBC has reduced exposure levels by palletizingbattery unloading (Ex. 592). The palletized batteries, which can then behandled by fork-lift trucks, eliminate workers' manual contact with batteriesat this stage and also eliminate exposure that results when employees handledry batteries or accidentally drop batteries.<T3>Cutting and Sawing. </T3>Information in the record indicates that batterybreakers that are controlling exposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\ in cuttingand sawing utilize low-speed saws. Those independent battery breakers thatmight still use high-speed saws or guillotines should replace them withlow-speed saws to reduce exposure levels. Where exposure levels exceed50 mg/m\3\ in the cutting area, the automated sawing equipment should alsobe enclosed and ventilated. This combination of controls should reduceexposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8).<T3>Dumping. </T3>To control exposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\, independentbattery breakers should install automated and enclosed dumping equipment.This combination of controls should reduce exposure levels below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8). Delatte already has achieved exposure levels below50 mg/m\3\ by using such equipment (Exs. 583-52, p. 3; 687-13).<T3>Crushing and Separating. </T3>Information in the record indicates thatbattery breaking facilities that are controlling exposure levels belowor close to 50 mg/m\3\ are using wet controls in the hammermill. Enclosingthe hammermill should reduce exposure levels to consistently below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8).To the extent that exposure levels may still exceed 50 mg/m\3\, independentbattery breakers might replace their saws, dumpers and hammermills withautomatic shredders, such as the Saturn shredder. At least five captivebattery breakers have installed Saturn shredders to process batteries (Ex.605). The Saturn shredder is a low-enargy machine that shreds batteriesinto pieces with two low-speed shafts with teeth. This system slowly shredsbatteries into separable pieces without hammering, pounding, ripping orusing any other high-energy force. Consequently, the generation of acidmist and lead particulate is low, which results in low exposure levels.If the use of a Saturn shredder does not reduce exposure levels consistentlyto below 50 mg/m\3\, the shredder may need to be enclosed and ventilated(Tr. 179).Where Saturn shredders are already being used by battery breakers, additionalimprovements can be implemented to further reduce exposure levels. Forexample, the capture point of the hood could be repositioned to more effectivelyexhaust lead dust. Enclosing the hopper more completely, moving the crushedbattery scrap by conveyor rather than front-end loader, and installinga ramp or slide gate under the shredder to avoid falling and splashingemissions will also reduce exposure levels in the shredding operation (Ex.592, p. 33).<T3>Loading. </T3>Independent battery breakers can reduce exposure levelsin loading the washed cells on trucks for shipment to secondary smeltersby replacing manual loading with front-end loaders. This should reduceexposure levels, even if the cabs are not enclosed (Ex. 582-52. p. 3).Where exposure levels exceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, the cabs of front-end loadersshould be enclosed and equipped with a HEPA filter and tempered air. Withsuch controls, typical air lead levels will be controlled to or below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8). <T3>Large Industrial Batteries. </T3>There are several readily availablecontrols that should be able to significantly reduce exposure levels inindustrial battery cutting. These controls include using a low-speed, ratherthan a high-speed saw, providing local exhaust ventilation, installingsupplied-air islands for the cutter, using alternative cutting methods,modifying cutting torches, using a saw, rather than a hand axe to cut thecells and limiting the amount of time an employee cuts industrial batteries(Exs. 605; 668F, pp. 3-4). There are several ventilation systems available to capture lead dust emittedduring industrial battery cutting. For example, Ashland reduced exposurelevels significantly by implementing a special ventilation system in thecutting area to push fume away from the operator's breathing area (Ex.668F, pp. 3-4). In 1986 Ashland also reported that it was working to adapta special welding exhaust system on the cutting torch itself (Ex. 668F,pp. 3-4). For these exhaust systems to operate efficiently, it is importantthat employees also be trained to properly position cutting devices andthemselves so as not to contaminate fresh air streams (Ex. 668F, pp. 3-4).Other available exhaust systems include downdraft or sidedraft ventilationwelding tables, portable high velocity/low volume local exhaust systems,with a turntable used as a work platform. such as that commonly used inlarge painting booths (Ex. 605). Another technology that has proven effectivein wide industrial use is the supplied-air island. Such an island couldbe installed specifically for the industrial battery breaker (Ex. 605)and would reduce exposures by as much as 23-77% (Ex. 583-16, p. 30). There are also available alternative methods for cutting off the casesof industrial batteries. These methods should reduce the amount of leaddust generated and thus reduce exposure levels. For example, there is a20-fold decrease in typical exposure levels when high-speed saws are replacedwith low-speed saws (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-8). Gas torches that create a greatamount of air turbulence and thus push lead fumes into the employee's breathingzone can be replaced with cutting devices which do not produce such airturbulence (Ex. 668F, p. 4). To the extent practicable, independent battery breakers should eliminatemanual breaking of industrial battery cells with saws or hand axes andprocess the cells in the facility's automotive battery breaking equipment(Ex. 553-7, p. 1-2). <T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusion. </T3>Based upon the above analysisof the evidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, theAgency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by engineeringand work practice controls is technologically feasible for the independentbattery breaking industry as a whole. Indeed, OSHA finds it feasible inevery operation, with the possible exception of the cutting of industrialbatteries. Since OSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL feasible for theindustry, employers will be required in the task of industrial batterycutting, as well, to implement engineering and work practice controls tocontrol exposure levels to the PEL or to the lowest feasible level. Ifemployers cannot achieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL by means of engineeringand work practice controls for workers performing this task, they are requiredto provide workers with respirators for supplemental protection. To sum up, OSHA has shown the following: One former and two current independentbattery breaking facilities already have achieved 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in manyoperations and many captive battery breakers have achieved that level inmost operations. These results have been achieved in independent facilitieswith existing controls, before OSHA's recommended additional controls havebeen implemented. With implementation of such additional controls, theAgency anticipates that exposure levels will be consistently controlledto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations, except perhaps the taskof manually cutting industrial batteries. OSHA believes that for operations where most sampling results or averageexposure levels already are close to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, relativelymodest improvements in controls, such as improved housekeeping or betterpreventive maintenance, will be sufficient to reduce air lead levels consistentlyto below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarly, for operations where most of thesampling results or average exposure levels are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\,OSHA believes that a combination of limited, additional and improved controls,such as extending wet control technology to all process areas, will besufficient to control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA's feasibility conclusion for the industrial battery breaking industryis supported by OSHA's previous determination that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL is feasible in captive battery breaking and by the court's upholdingof that determination. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d 1189. The process and control technology availableand in use in captive battery breaking operations is conventional and readilyapplicable and transferrable to independent facilities with little, ifany, modification. Thus the controls needed to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in independent batterybreaking all are conventional and readily available. OSHA has not neededto exercise its statutory authority to force the development of new technologyin this industry in order to justify the Agency's finding of technologicalfeasibility. OSHA believes that its technological feasibility determination is conservativein at least two respects. On the one hand, as indicated above, most independentbattery breakers will not need to implement all of the recommended additionalcontrols to control exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Some independentbattery breakers should be able to consistently control exposure levelsbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ solely by improving work practices and keeping thebatteries and work area wet. On the other hand, in reaching its conclusion, OSHA does not purport tohave recommended an exhaustive list of additional controls. The Agencyis certain that industry will be capable of devising and fine-tuning variousother controls to further reduce exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA anticipatesthat industry will be able to consistently achieve exposure levels at orbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in virtually every phase of battery processing.OSHA believes that achieving the PEL requires implementing an integratedsystem of controls. The basic element of that system is an industrial hygienestudy. Each independent battery breaker will be required by paragraph (e)(3)of the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025) to establish and implement a writtencompliance program that includes an in-depth job/task analysis and a plant-widesurvey. This survey and analysis should be performed by an experiencedindustrial hygienist who shall identify sources of emission in each taskand sources of cross drafts and cross contamination. Such an analysis shouldalso recommend appropriate engineering and work practice controls to controlemissions, control cross drafts and cross contamination, and generallyto minimize employee exposures. If, after implementing these recommendations,reductions in air lead levels deviate substantially from what was anticipated,a followup industrial hygiene survey should be conducted and necessarycorrections made.The second element in that system is the development of good, written housekeepingand work practice programs, as required by paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of thelead standard, that are systematically implemented so that proper workprocedures are routinely and meticulously followed. For example, equipmentshould be washed down daily. The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean and efficientcondition. The independent battery breaking industry does not agree that a PEL of50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable. Industry's disagreement is based upon fourmain arguments. The four main arguments are: a prior OSHA contractor concludedthat 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is not feasible; Ashland cannot achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\even though it has implemented state-of-the-art controls and further technologydoes not exist to control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\; Meridian'sreport is incorrect, incompetent and unsupported; and the evidence in theremand record does not support a determination that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ istechnologically feasible. First, industry asserts that OSHA's contractor, JACA, previously concludedthat it was not technologically feasible to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ bymeans of engineering and work practice controls (Ex. 582-88, pp. 6-8).Industry asserts that JACA found that even after implementing additionalcontrols exposure levels would be in excess of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in cuttingand sawing, dumping and loading with front-end loaders; and that JACA advisedOSHA that respirator utilization would continue to be required to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA does not agree. JACA stated that ``[a] strong case can be made for[the] technological feasibility'' of achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\by means of engineering and work practice controls:<ITAG tagnum="21">Although the precise achievable exposure levels cannot be determinedin advance for any one plant, there is no known physical reason why exposurelevels could not be brought into compliance with [50 andCx.18;g/m\3\]. (Ex.553-7, p. 1-13)</ITAG>JACA's conclusion of technological feasibility is predicated on its expressfindings that with controls typical air lead levels could be controlledto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in almost every operation: unloading, tipping,cutting and sawing, dumping, crushing, separating and loading (Ex. 553-7,p. 1-8). As to these operations, industry simply misunderstands JACA'sreport. In three other operations, grinding, paste drying and furnace,JACA did find that exposure levels would be in excess of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\even with controls. However, there is no evidence in the remand recordnor any assertion by industry that independent battery breakers continueto perform these three operations. Industry also misunderstands JACA's report when it asserts that JACA foundthat respirators would still be required to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. WhileJACA did note that the industry as a whole was quite far from compliancein 1982 without regard to use of respirators, JACA did find that ``numeroustechnological innovations are available for implementation to reduce exposurelevels'' (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-13). This point is especially important todaybecause JACA's list of control technologies available to the industry didnot include certain recent control technologies, such as Saturn shredders,cutting torch ventilation and wet shipment of groups. Finally, industry also asserts that the JACA report effectively concludedthat a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ was infeasible when JACA said ``evidencesuggests that a combination of automation/isolation, with controls on workpractices (particularly housekeeping) should be able to bring exposurelevels quite <T3>close to </T3>the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ '' (emphasis added). Farfrom being a conclusion that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically infeasible,JACA's finding was that independent battery breakers can almost achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ solely by automating and enclosing equipment and implementinggood work practices. OSHA agrees with JACA's finding, as far as it goes.OSHA also believes that these controls in combination with implementationand improvements in process equipment (e.g., Saturn shredder), water spraysystems and/or ventilation will bring exposure levels in this industryconsistently to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In addition, OSHA's believesthat, with the implementation of good work practices and ventilation, theindustry can bring exposure levels in industrial battery cutting closeto 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Second, industry argues that Ashland cannot achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ eventhough it has implemented state-of-the-art controls and that further technologydoes not exist to control exposure levels at Ashland and Ace to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Exs. 582-88, p. 14; 680, p. 2; 694-1, pp. 4-5, 13, 16). While OSHA concedesthat, based on data submitted by Ashland, the company is not achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations all of the time, the Agency does notagree that Ashland has not been able, or is presently unable to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA maintains that, despite the characterization ofAshland as ``state-of-the-art,'' there are many additional controls andimprovements that can be implemented there. For example, Ashland stillhas not replaced manual shakeout of batteries with automated and encloseddumping equipment, a control technology that has been implemented successfullyat least since 1982 (Exs. 553-7, p. 1-7; 687-1). Also, at Ashland batteriesare still manually unloaded from delivery trucks. Nonetheless, OSHA hasshown that at Ashland by 1986 sampling results and average exposure levelsalready were close to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations. Ace argues that no technology exists to further reduce exposure levelsat its facility. However, Ace has not enclosed any of its production equipment,another control technology that most independent battery breakers had alreadyimplemented on cutting and dumping equipment by 1982 (Ex. 553-7, p. 1-7).Like Ashland, batteries also are still manually unloaded at Ace. Thus, the reason that Ashland and Ace are not achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\consistently is not because they have reached the limits of technologicalfeasibility. Rather, it is because they have not implemented readily available,conventional controls that other battery breaking facilities have foundsuccessful in reducing exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA is unpersuadedby industry's argument that Ace and Ashland have ``state-of-the-art'' technology,have been unable to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and that therefore the PELis unachievable by engineering and work practice controls. Third, industry asserts that Meridian's report is incorrect, incompetentand unsupported by the record (Exs. 582-88, p. 16; 694-39, p. 3). On thewhole, OSHA rejects these criticisms and believes that Meridian did a creditablejob, particularly given the time and resource constraints under which itwas operating. Meridian has had extensive experience and possesses very broad competencein the area of industrial hygiene, the principles of which are universallyapplicable to all industries. It also has broad expertise and experiencein assessing factors relevant to technological feasibility. Physically,there is nothing unique about lead dust or about independent battery breakingthat would make Meridian's extensive expertise and competence in evaluatingengineering and work practice controls across many industries irrelevantto this industry. The control technologies recommended here to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ are conventional and transferrable from similar industriesand from captive battery breaking, and the effectiveness of these controlsin reducing air lead levels also is the same across industries. OSHA concludes that Meridian's reports and its conclusions are based uponthe best available evidence. Meridian's reports, including revisions toits preliminary report based upon industry comments, generally are firmlygrounded in the record and its conclusions are based on numerous sourcesin that record. These include data, other evidence and comments submittedby employers, trade associations and other interested parties. In any event, OSHA has independently assessed the record, reviewed Meridian'sfinal report for accuracy, taken account of industry's comments on thatreport, and relied only in part upon the Meridian reports for the Agency'sdetermination of technological feasibility. Fourth, industry asserts that the evidence in the remand record does notsupport a determination that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible.OSHA disagrees with this argument, as this feasibility assessment indicates.OSHA's statutory obligation is to make its feasibility determination basedon the best available evidence in the record. OSHA has actively soughtto collect and develop a full and accurate record. OSHA is persuaded thatit has more than enough information and data in the record upon which tobase its determination of technological feasibility. In arguing that the record does not support the feasibility of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), asserts that200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is the lowest feasible level technologically achievable(Ex. 582-88, pp. 6, 21) and Ace asserts that a level of 100-125 andCx.18;g/m\3\in five years is the lowest feasible level (Ex. 694-1, p. 10). Both ISRIand Ace have failed to present data and information to support their positions.In fact, the data supplied by ISRI for Ashland shows that, by 1986, 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ already is being achieved or is close to being achieved inevery operation. OSHA therefore finds unpersuasive industry's argument that the evidencein the record is insufficient to prove the technological feasibility ofa PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Thus, for all the above reasons, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry's argumentsthat the PEL cannot be achieved by means of engineering and work practicecontrols. Based upon its own expertise, experience and the record evidence,OSHA concludes that a PEL of 50 mg/m\3\ is achievable in the independentbattery breaking industry by means of engineering and work practice controls,with the possible exception of large industrial battery cutting. In thatoperation it may be necessary for employers to rely upon respirators forsupplemental protection.<T3>Industry Profile.</T3> This sector is comprised of establishments whichbreak down used batteries into various components, including used leadcells, polypropylene and other plastics, and sulfuric acid. Firms in theindependent battery breaking sector own facilities that process batteriesbut do not engage in secondary lead smelting; instead, these companiessell the recovered lead to secondary smelters.It is believed that at least three independent battery breakers are inoperation today, with the total lead exposed workforce estimated at approximately30 employees. This represents a dramatic decline from the estimated 250independent battery breaking firms operating in 1978.For most of the current decade, economic conditions have not been favorablefor independent battery breaking. Prices of pig lead and scrap lead, whilepeaking in 1979, declined substantially through 1985 at which point theyapproached historic lows [Ex. 576, p. 5]. Additionally, many battery breakingfacilities had accumulated large piles of used battery casings and disposalof this hazardous waste required substantial financial outlays [Ex. 576,p. 2]. Recently prices have risen significantly and the current price isabout 37 cents per pound. In response to the increase in the price of lead,one independent battery breaker, Ashland Metals Company, which ceased operationsin July 1986, has reopened under new ownership to conduct ``limited operations.''[Ex. 686f, p. 1]. Another indication that financial conditions for batterybreakers are improving is the reported opening of a new facility [Ex. 686f,p. 2].Secondary smelters purchase the lead product produced by the independentbreaker. It is reported by the industry that the independent breaker isforced to produce its product at the price being paid by the smelter [Ex.694-1, p. 7].Financial information was received from one independent battery breaker[Ex. 694-1]. Rates of return on assets (ROA), equity, and net worth werepresented for the years 1983 through 1987 and reflect both the recent increasein lead prices and the preceding lows; rates were negative in 1986 butpositive in 1987. The ROA for this firm in 1987 was 22.06 percent, withall returns lead related. Since resuming operations, Ashland Metals isalso believed to be profitable [Ex. 686f, p. 8]. No information has beensubmitted with regard to other independent breakers. <T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>The costs to be borne by an independent batterybreaker have been based on the incremental costs which are estimated tobe incurred by two independent breakers, Ashland Metals and Ace Battery.Independent battery breakers may be able to control exposure levels inevery operation except industrial battery cutting through the use of wetcontrols. Incremental costs for a water spray system were estimated tobe about $14,000 (based on Means Site Work Cost Data, 1987). Annualizedcapital costs would be $2,054 and Oandamp;M costs would be $1,399. Totalannual costs for the water system are estimated to be $3,453.Ace Battery, however, already primarily relies on wet control technology;thus, incremental costs for improvements to this facility's wet controlsystem were assumed to be minimal.Ventilation costs for industrial battery cutting operations are estimatedto be $17,500, based on air volume requirements of 2,500 cfm and a unitcost of $7 per cfm [Exs. 686f; 643]. Annualized capital costs would be$2,569 and Oandamp;M costs would be $1,750. The total annual cost for ventilationwas $4,319. Costs were not estimated for ventilation of the industrialbattery cutter for Ashland since information in the public record indicatedthat this facility had already implemented some ventilation at this operationand that further improvements were being investigated [Ex. 668F].Thus, annual costs for Ashland Metals for the technology described abovewould be $3,453 (for water controls) while annual costs for Ace would be$4,319 (for ventilation of the industrial battery cutter).To the extent that water control technology cannot reduce exposure levelsbelow 50 mg/m\3\ in all operations, costs for additional controls may beincurred as described below; it is unlikely, however, that either facilitywill require each control.Additional costs for the Ashland facility could include costs for an automated,enclosed dumper; enclosure of the hammermill; ventilation of the low speedsaw; enclosing and ventilating cabs of payloaders; and additional housekeeping.Costs for an automatic dumper are estimated to be $57,000 [Ex. 686f, p.7]. (It is assumed that this cost includes enclosure.) Annualized capitalcosts would be $8,368, based on a twelve year useful life and a 10 percentcost of capital. Operating and maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses would beapproximately 10 percent of capital costs, or $5,700. Total annual costsfor this equipment are thus estimated to be $14,068.OSHA assumes the costs of enclosing the hammermill to be $10,000. Annualizedcapital costs are estimated to be $1,468. Oandamp;M costs are estimated tobe negligible, as this control would require little or no maintenance.Costs for ventilation of the low speed saw were estimated to be $17,500,based on an air volume requirement of 2,500 cfm and a unit cost of $7 percfm [Exs. 686f; 643]. Annualized capital costs would be $2,569 and Oandamp;Mcosts would be $1,750. The total annual cost for this system was thus estimatedto be $4,319.Costs for cab enclosures were estimated to be $5,000 per unit [Ex. 686c,pp. 32-33.] Annualized capital costs would be $734 per unit, and annualOandamp;M expenses would be $3,600, including HEPA filter replacement. Assumingfour such cabs are required for the Ashland facility, total annual costsfor cab enclosures were estimated to be $17,336.Finally, costs incurred for additional housekeeping will be $975. (Thisestimate assumes that one-half hour of labor per day will be required 5days per week for 50 weeks at an hourly wage of $7.80).Thus, total annual incremental costs for the Ashland Metals plant wereestimated to range from $3,453 to $41,619.Additional costs for the Ace Battery plant could include costs for enclosureof the automatic dumper; enclosure of the hammermill; ventilation of thelow speed saw; enclosing and ventilating cabs of payloaders; and additionalhousekeeping.Costs for enclosure of the hammermill, enclosing and ventilating cabs ofpayloaders, ventilation of the low speed saw, and additional housekeepingwere computed above for the Ashland Metals facility. Annual costs for enclosureof the automatic dumper are estimated to be the same as those assumed forenclosure of the hammermill, $1,468.Total annual costs for the Ace Battery facility were thus estimated torange from $4,319 to $29,885.The initial costs of an industrial hygiene survey were estimated to be$1,000. Such a survey would require one day to survey the work area andone day to collect exposure data and to evaluate existing controls. Norecurring costs would be required.Compliance costs for the new facility reported to be opening were assumedto be negligible, as this facility will be using fully automated equipment[Ex. 686f, p. 2]. Based on evidence in the public record which indicates the existence ofthree independent battery breakers, total annual incremental costs forthis industry were estimated to range from $7,772 to $71,504. (OSHA doesnot have sufficient information to suggest that there are more than threeindependent breakers). <T3>Economic Feasibility. </T3>The financial data submitted by the BatterySalvage Division of Ace Battery, Inc., along with information providedto OSHA by its contractor, Meridian Research, indicate that profitabilityfor the independent battery breakers is highly dependent upon the priceof lead. Ace Battery also provided production volume data [Ex. 694-1, p.15]. No financial information was submitted into the record regarding Ashland.Ace battery processes approximately 1.3 million batteries per year [Ex.694-1, p. 15]. To the recycler, these batteries represent about $2 in revenueeach. Thus, revenues for this facility are estimated to have been about$2.6 million, necessitating a price increase of about 0.2 to 1.1 percentto offset the costs of compliance. Ashland was reported to have the capacityto process 10,000 batteries per day [Ex. 576]. After ceasing operationsin 1986, however, it reopened under new management one year later and beganlimited operations [Ex. 686f], and OSHA assumes that at least 5,000 batteriesare currently processed per day at this facility. Thus, price increasesrequired for full pass-through for Ashland would be about 0.1 to 1.6 percent.The ability to pass costs forward is reported by industry to be limited,as the independent breaker must take the price offered by the secondarysmelter [Ex. 694-1, p. 7]. However, as smelter demand for lead batteryplates exceeds their capacity to produce these plates themselves, strongdemand may allow the independent breakers to increase prices. Inventory and seasonal fluctuations affect battery breaking operations.A smelter with a two or three month stock of plates will not be inclinedto buy plates from an independent breaker. Also, battery disposal slacksoff during the summer months. Both of these situations result in the batterybreaker having to periodically cut back its operations which in turn limitsits ability to pass costs forward to smelters or backward to suppliers.Though no estimates of profit levels were provided by the independent batterybreakers, evidence suggests that 1987 prices allowed at least one independentbreaker, Ace Battery, to realize revenues and rates of return sufficientto allow the annual costs to be absorbed [Ex. 694-1]. (It was reportedthat a strike at a major lead mine and smelter in Canada was probably responsiblefor higher prices; while this increase could be temporary, prices havenot yet fallen). Based on the revenue estimates developed above, OSHA computedprofit impacts based on an assumed rate of return on sales (ROS) of 5 percent.OSHA believes this rate of return to be a reasonable estimate, since returnon assets for Ace was over 22 percent in 1987. This ROS would result inprofits of $130,000 for both Ace and Ashland. Associated profit impactswere estimated to fall between 2.3 and 16.1 percent for Ace and 1.9 and22.4 for Ashland. It should be noted that the tax deductibility of compliancecosts was taken into account in computing profit impacts. That is, carewas taken to compute before-tax profit before subtracting annual costs.After subtracting annual costs, the appropriate average tax rate (30 percent)was then reapplied to determine after-tax profit net of costs. OSHA's estimatesof post-compliance ROS range from 4.2 to 4.9 percent for Ace, 3.9 to 4.9percent for Ashland. Since Ace realized an ROA of over 22 percent in 1987,as noted above, indications are that compliance costs can be absorbed withoutundue burden on profitability. OSHA does not feel that the structure of the battery breaking industrywill be further disrupted by regulating independent breakers. There arenow 18 secondary smelters with breaking operations (these are already requiredto meet the 50 microgram per cubic meter standard and are reported to becomplying) as well as the 3 independent breakers documented in the record.The regional nature of the supply and demand relationship in the secondarylead industry is such that it is doubtful that many of these facilitiescompete directly with one another. OSHA finds that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL is economically feasible for theIndependent Battery Breaking Industry within a two and one-half year complianceperiod. One firm is estimated to incur no cost. For two other firms, impactsare not projected to place undue burden on profitability. Thus, this rulemakingwill not disrupt the battery breaking industry in the U.S., and it mayaccelerate the shift to more environmentally sound technology and plantdesign. Also, the decision to open a new independent battery breaking facilityindicates industry confidence in continued profitability.<T3>3. Lead Chemicals_Process Description. </T3>Lead oxides are the majorproduct produced by the lead chemical industry, accounting for approximately85% of total industry production by weight (Ex. 575, pp. 7-9). Thus, theproduction of lead chemicals is largely the production of lead oxides.Lead oxides are produced exclusively by a dry process, which essentiallyinvolves the creation and collection of oxidized lead dust. Lead oxidesare interacted with appropriate acids in a wet process to produce otherlead chemicals like lead soaps and stabilizers. <T3>Dry Process. </T3>Overview: The manufacturing process of lead oxidebegins with the melting of pig lead in a melt pot. From the melt pot, themolten metal flows into a Barton kettle, where it is oxidized by aeration.The resulting lead oxide is then collected as dust, which can either besold as product (high-metallic lead oxide (``HM'')) or be further oxidizedin other furnaces to form red lead or litharge, the main products of theindustry. a. Production of High-Metallic Lead Oxide: HM lead oxide is approximately70% to 80% lead oxide (PbO); the balance is metallic lead. HM lead oxideis produced from elemental lead pigs and ingots, which are received atplants aboard rail cars and transported by fork lift trucks to the meltareas as needed. The lead is then fed by hoist or conveyor into a heatedpot a few feet in diameter to be melted. The melt must be drossed to removeimpurities on the average of once a day (Ex. 684b, p. 2). Drossing takes5 to 15 minutes (Exs. 684b, p. 2 and 694-9, p. 23). From the melt, molten lead flows down a trough or is pumped to an adjacentBarton kettle. To produce lead oxide, the molten lead in the Barton isagitated and exposed to an air stream created by an exhaust fan associatedwith a dust collector, which pulls air into the Barton. The air streamthen draws the lead oxide and lead fume off from the Barton through coolingand settling chambers and cyclones into a bag-filter dust collector. Thefiltered air is exhausted to the outside atmosphere. As the air stream moves from the Barton kettle through the process, leadoxide particles are collected in settling chambers, cyclone separatorsand bag houses. The product is then transferred by screw conveyors, bucketelevators and/or pneumatic conveying systems to storage hoppers. Thereafter,the HM oxide may be milled to produce a finer product or fed by mechanizedor pneumatic material transfer systems to the calcining furnaces for furtheroxidation, to produce red lead or litharge. b. Calcining: Both litharge (PbO) and red lead (Pb<T2>3</T2>O<T2>4</T2>) are made by heating and further oxidizing HM lead oxide ina calcining furnace. The process takes place at high temperatures, withcontinuous mixing for hours. In older plants, red lead and litharge areproduced in ``rake'' furnaces, where the lead oxide is continuously turnedover by rakes to oxidize it. At the end of these oxidation processes, thelead oxides are cooled and transferred by mechanized or pneumatic materialtransfer systems to hoppers for storage prior to milling and/or bulk loadingor packaging. c. Grinding and Blending: Some portion of lead oxides are milled or groundto size, commonly in hammermills. The entire process occurs in a closedsystem operated under negative pressure. The finished material is collectedin bag houses and gravity fed or conveyed to hoppers for storage. Milledproducts stored from different batches are sometimes blended to meet productspecifications. These processes and connecting conveying systems generallyare mechanized. d. Packaging and Shipping: Over 85% of all lead oxides are shipped fromthe producing plants in bulk by truck or rail car (See ``Additional Controls,''below). Another portion of the product is shipped in semi-bulk containers,like superbags and air pallets. The remaining portion is packaged for shipmentin much smaller containers like drums and 20- and 50-pound paper or plasticbags. In bulk and semi-bulk shipping, the containers are usually filled througha pipe from an overhead hopper. Smaller containers, like drums, are filledin a similar manner, except that some manual adjustment of product weightto meet customer specifications may be required at times. The industry continues to package some of its product in bags because ofcustomer demand for a variety of weights and package types. Some customers,for example, require that accurately-weighed contents be in plastic bags,so the bags with their contents can be thrown directly into the customers'chemical processes. The bags are packed on bagging machines, which are fed lead oxide by gravityfrom overhead hoppers. The bagging operator places the valve of a bag overthe machine's filling spout, and the machine fills the bag to the set cut-offweight. As the bag is being filled, the machine exhausts the displacedair from the bag. When the bag is filled, the operator removes it and placesit on a scale beside the bagging machine. If the customer requires accurately-weighedcontents and the bag is underweight or overweight, the operator uses atrowel and a bucket to add or remove small amounts of lead oxide. The packagerthen seals the bag and places it on a pallet. <T3>Wet Processes. </T3>In wet chemical processes, lead oxide (litharge)is slurried with water and then reacted with appropriate acids to formone of numerous lead soaps and stabilizers. The manufacturing processesfor these lead chemicals commonly are automated, with mechanized materialtransfer between hoppers and reaction tanks and remote control of the transfer,makeup, and reaction operations by operators in air-conditioned controlrooms. During these processes, the product precipitates out of the reactionliquor, is separated by filtration or centrifugation, dried, and conveyedto storage hoppers. The dried product is milled and stored in hoppers againbefore blending, packaging, and shipping. A higher proportion of theseproducts is shipped in non-bulk form.<T3>Sources of Exposure. </T3>Since a lead oxide plant may produce thousandsof pounds a day of fine, dust-like lead oxides and since it does not takemuch lead dust dispersed throughout a building to equal 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,it is obvious that it is essential to prevent the escape of dust from processequipment. Although lead is present in every operation in the productionof lead oxides, to the extent that the production process is entirely enclosed,mechanized and operated under negative pressure, the sources of lead exposurecan be quite limited (Exs. 582-90, p. 12; 694-9, Att. 6, p. 5). As industry sources have indicated, the production of lead oxide is highlyautomated. After the operator loads lead ingots into the melt kettle, theproduct is not handled until the product is packaged or loaded into bulktrucks (Exs. 582-90, p. 12; 694-9. Att. 6, p. 5). Consequently, exceptfor leaks and breakdowns, there is no direct source of lead exposure forworkers during that process unless they are performing periodic manualtasks that require interaction with the process (e.g., quality controlsampling; Ex. 684b, p. 10). On the other hand, to the extent that portionsof the production process are not fully enclosed, mechanized or operatedunder negative pressure, potential sources of lead emission increase. Acrossthe industry, packaging and maintenance are generally considered the twooperations that contribute most to high air lead levels (Exs. 582-90, p.7; 694-9, Att. 2-4; Tr. 1266). Feeding the melt pot with lead at the beginning of the production processdoes not appear to create substantial employee exposure to lead, in partbecause mechanical means are commonly used to feed the lead pigs into themelt pot and in part because the lead at this stage is still in solid form.In contrast, packaging the product at the end of the process in bags (andto a lesser extent in drums) undoubtedly contributes more than any othersingle operation to high employee exposure levels. At process points inbetween, some manual operations like drossing and product quality controlsampling may also contribute to employee lead exposure. In addition, the extensive mechanized system for transferring materialsthroughout the process can be a substantial source of lead exposure ifit is not completely enclosed. Even where the material transfer systemis completely enclosed (e.g., screw conveyors), product leaks from variouspoints on the conveyor can be a major source of lead emission. If the sourceof the leak is not promptly repaired and the spilled materials promptlycleaned up, employees throughout the area can be exposed. Aside from potential sources of exposure associated directly with productionprocesses, employees may also be exposed to high air lead levels duringmaintenance, which is performed intermittently. When equipment that regularlyhandles large amounts of lead dust periodically has to be opened to berepaired or cleaned, the employee performing the job and others in thearea may encounter air lead levels in excess of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. A veryhigh proportion of maintenance appears to be devoted to upkeep of mechanizedmaterial transfer systems (MMTS), like bucket elevators and screw conveyors(Ex. 684c, p. 5). As indicated, packaging is the operation that contributes most to employeeexposure levels. While there may be some potential lead exposure associatedwith all forms of non-bulk packaging (e.g., cleaning superbags if usedbags are returned), packaging in small bags generally poses the major problem.The bagging process currently in use in the lead chemicals industry, includingthe handling of filled bags, involves a number of manual interventionsby the operator, all of which constitute potential sources of lead emission.For example, operators place the bag on the machine spout and remove itwhen the machine stops the flow of lead oxide at the desired weight. Inaddition, when customer specifications for product weight in the bag areprecise, the operator weighs the bag and, if the weight is incorrect, manuallyadds or removes product to achieve the correct weight. In some cases, thesetolerances can be as narrow as plus or minus 1.5 ounces for a 50-poundbag (.2%) (Tr. 1282). Furthermore, when the bag is filled, it must be closed,surface dust must be removed, and the bag must be stacked on a pallet alongwith other bags. The physical attributes of lead oxide and of the bags used in packagingcontribute to the exposure problems in this operation. For example, becauselead oxides and many lead chemicals are sticky and may flow erratically(e.g., like flour), these substances may back up in the filling spout andthen drop down unexpectedly when the operator touches the spout to attachor detach the bag. In addition, generally the bags used in this industrybreathe when handled. When a bag breathes out, it emits a puff of air thatmay contain lead dust. Such puffs may be emitted when the bag is closed,when it is transported to and stacked on a pallet, and when other bagsare stacked on top of it. Concerning operations and exposures of workers involved in producing leadchemicals other than oxides, there is little or no information in the recordof this industry. Production of these lead chemicals is largely by wetprocess, which tends to minimize lead emissions. However, drying, blending,and packaging of the product at the end of the process do constitute potentialsources of lead exposure, as do spills of lead slurries that have beenallowed to dry.<T3>Existing Exposure Levels_ The Data Sets. </T3>There are eight datasets on employee lead exposures in the record. Most of these were submittedby employers in response to a letter request from OSHA. The employer isrequired to collect these data and to make them available to OSHA underthe lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025(n)). The eight data sets include data collected in 1981 by OSHA's former contractor,JACA (Exs. 553-1; 575, pp. 3-5); data from Plant A (Exs. 686E, p. 19; 688c);data from Plant B (Exs. 686E, p. 20; 684b); data from Plant C (Exs. 686E,p. 19; 684c); data from Plant X (Exs. 686E, p. 19; 688b); data from PlantM (Exs. 686E, p. 20; 688d); data from OSHA inspections (Ex. 583-4); andaggregate data from an unspecified number of plants submitted by the Oxideand Chemicals Committee of the lead industry's main trade association,the Lead Industries Association (``LIA'') (Ex. 582-90, App. A). Following the methodology for evaluating data described in the introductionto technological feasibility, OSHA reviewed these eight data sets for theirapplicability to feasibility analysis. Of the eight, six are useable. Ofthese, the data submitted by Plant A, in conjunction with OSHA's 1988 sitevisit to that facility, constitute the most reliable evidence for assessingtechnological feasibility in the record. Plant A has supplied OSHA with the most extensive set of useable data inthis proceeding (Ex. 688c). The data are recent and complete for four years.The data also are effectively annotated to aid in interpretation. For example,unusually high exposure levels are typically identified by annotation,and when the causes are known they too are noted. Annotations also typicallyidentify job tasks and work areas involved during monitoring. In addition,OSHA's site visit enables the Agency to concretely appreciate the productionand control context in which these exposures have occurred, including theexisting controls and production processes associated with particular exposurelevels, as well as general conditions in the plant (Ex. 684a). All of thisallows OSHA to effectively use the data and information made availableby Plant A in making a comprehensive and well-informed assessment of technologicalfeasibility. For these reasons, OSHA intends to rely heavily on the record data andinformation made available by Plant A. OSHA believes this reliance is especiallyjustified because technological feasibility judgments based on Plant Ashould be conservative for the industry as a whole. Plant A is old andnot modernized. Additional, conventional engineering controls can be implementedthere to reduce existing air lead levels. In addition, from the site visitit was apparent that the plant was quite dirty and that housekeeping andother work practices also can be substantially improved to further reduceair lead levels (Ex. 684a. pp. 12-13). However, some question might be raised as to whether data and informationconcerning the packaging operation at Plant A can be taken as representativeof the industry. Packer/blender/dryer operators (PBDs) at Plant A performother lead-exposed operations in addition to packaging (Ex. 684a, p. 4).Nevertheless, for purposes of determining feasibility, OSHA does not considerthat this fact, absent any information in the record to the contrary, makesPlant A's monitoring results for PBDs unrepresentative of packers in otherplants in the industry. There are several reasons for this. First, Plant A is not the only plant where workers who pack also performother duties. Indeed, at Plant B, for example, there is not a categorycalled ``packer'' (Ex. 684b). Workers in other named job classificationssimply spend part of their time in the plant packing. Second, since PlantA appears to package a much higher proportion of its product in bags thanis typical throughout the industry (see discussion below), the amount oftime workers spend packaging at Plant A may actually be more, rather thanless, than is typical throughout the industry. Thus, the lead exposuresof Plant A's PBD operators are likely to overstate, rather than understate,exposures of operators in other plants. Finally, OSHA knows that dryingand blending operations also are sources of potentially high air lead levels(see discussion of drying and blending in OSHA's technological feasibilityassessment for the lead pigments industry). As a consequence, the overalllead exposure of PBDs at Plant A may also be high precisely because someof their time is allocated to drying and blending. Consequently, OSHA's reliance on the exposure data for Plant A's PBDs asthe starting point in an analysis of the feasibility of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in packaging may be conservative in that these data are likely to overstatethe extent of the problem of controlling employee exposures during packaging.At worst, such reliance is unlikely to be prejudicial to the industry becauseit is unlikely that this approach understates the extent of the problem.The second useable data set is from Plant B (Ex. 684b). Plant B's dataalso are quite extensive and recent. However, the data are not annotatedto explain, where necessary, the conditions under which monitoring occurred.Thus, for example, OSHA cannot tell why in 1987 the range of 19 monitoringresults for the job category of operator extends all the way from 8-579andCx.18;g/m\3\, why three (259, 295, and 579 andCx.18;g/m\3\) of these resultsare unaccountably much higher than the others and why the 579 andCx.18;g/m\3\result is more than three times as high as the highest of the 16 othermonitoring results. Nevertheless, because OSHA gathered useful contextualinformation on its 1988 site visit to Plant B (Ex. 684b), OSHA finds PlantB's data set also useful for assessing technological feasibility. The third useable data set is from Plant X (Exs. 686E, p. 19; 688e). Thedata in this set also are quite complete and recent. But again, the dataset is not annotated to explain, where necessary, the conditions underwhich monitoring occurred. More importantly, the remand rulemaking recordis devoid of the contextual information concerning existing controls, productionprocesses, and general plant conditions that is so important to make senseof the data. This information is not in the record because a report ofOSHA's 1987 site visit to Plant X was withdrawn from the record at thecompany's insistence. OSHA therefore finds the Plant X data less usefulthan the Plant A and Plant B data. The fourth useable data set is from Plant M (Ex. 688d). The data providedfor that plant are incomplete, especially for the three years prior to1987. Like Plant X, no annotations to the data are provided, and OSHA'sreport on its site visit to the plant was removed from the record at thecompany's request. Moreover, Plant M uses wet and dry processes to producelead stabilizers; it does not produce lead oxides. Generally, the datafrom Plant M are useable to represent the production of lead chemicalsother than lead oxides. In addition, exposure data from Plant M for specificoperations that are common to both oxide and non-oxide production, likepackaging, are useable to represent exposure levels that are achievablethroughout the industry when modernized equipment is used in such operations.The fact that the Agency cannot determine from the record precisely whichamong the array of conventional engineering and work practice controlsare being implemented at Plant M to achieve its relatively low levels inpackaging does not vitiate the reality that these levels are already beingachieved there in what all concede to be among the dirtiest operationsin the industry (Exs. 582-90, p. 7; 694-9, Att. 2-4; Tr. 1266-67). The fifth useable data set is company-supplied data provided in the 1982JACA report (Exs. 553-1; 575, pp. 3-5). OSHA concludes this report andthe data in it are of only limited utility for several reasons. The dataare seven years or more old. Some significant improvements to controlshave been made in operations in certain plants since the time the datawere collected (Ex. 585-90, pp. 12, 19). Moreover, JACA did not supplythe detailed, contextual information concerning associated engineeringand work practice controls, production processes and general plant conditionsso important to meaningfully interpret the data. Mostly, the data and thereport are useful simply to confirm the broad outlines of industry exposurepatterns. For example, then as now, the highest exposure levels occur inpacking, and employees who work in other operations appear to suffer higherlevels of exposure due to cross contamination from lead emissions in thepackaging operation and in material transfers (Ex. 684a, p. 13). The sixth useable data set is comprised of data from OSHA inspections betweenJune 1979 and March 1987, which is contained in OSHA's Integrated ManagementInformation System (``IMIS''; Ex. 583-4). Because this data set may includesome monitoring results from unrelated industry sectors, and because thenumber of total samples is small and is dispersed among a number of plants,and because little associated, contextual information is provided, OSHAfinds this data set of only minimal utility. The IMIS data demonstratethat, for the plants inspected, more than 40% of all employee monitoringresults were below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The remaining two data sets have very limited value. One, the LIA dataset (Ex. 582-90, Appendix A and pp. 7-8), does not identify which plantsare represented and, more importantly, is not organized according to plants.The participating plants' data for a period ranging from January 1985 toAugust 1987 are pooled and then divided according to five job classifications.Thus, OSHA cannot determine exposure levels operation by operation in eachplant. Moreover, regarding existing controls. LIA provides nothing thatcan be used to establish which controls were in place when monitoring wasconducted. As a result, OSHA cannot determine from the LIA submission whatcontrols are associated with particular exposure levels.Moreover, although LIA provides what it claims to be typical ranges ofexposure data for the five job categories, the ranges do not accuratelyreflect much of the raw data LIA submits for these very categories. Noexplanation of the apparent discrepancy is provided. LIA also does notdistinguish between exposure levels in new and old plants or between exposurelevels in lead oxide production (dry process) and in other lead chemicalproduction (mostly wet process). Thus, monitoring results from potentiallyvery different plants and operations are inextricably mixed together inthis data set. In addition, based upon the data discussed below, OSHA knows that the extremelywide range of monitoring results for each job classification (e.g., packer,from 22 mg/m\3\ to 2,009 mg/m\3\) and the high averages for nearly alljob classifications (e.g., leadman, 338  mg/m\3\) reflected in this dataset are not representative of the current best operations in the industryor of what can be achieved. For all the above reasons, OSHA finds the LIAdata of very limited use for purposes of determining technological feasibilityin this rulemaking. Fortunately, the three largest companies in the industry,which were the industry employers who were most active in the rulemaking,independently submitted data plant by plant and provided other informationthat are much more detailed and useful than what LIA provided. The other data set that has very limited value is provided by Plant C.Although OSHA made a site visit to this plant and thus was able to obtainthe kind of contextual information about controls and processes that isimportant in interpreting exposure data, the actual exposure data providedby the company are sparse (Ex. 684c). In fact, many fewer employee samplingresults were submitted than are required by the lead standard. In 1987,for example, only eight personal samples are reported to have been collectedfor the entire plant, all on two days near the end of the year. Moreover,the data consist primarily of area samples, which are of only limited usein determining actual employee exposure levels, and include very few personalmonitoring results.In addition, the data are not broken down according to named job classificationsor named operations. Plant C also does not provide notations concerningoperating conditions that existed on the two days that employee samplingwas carried out, despite the fact that three of the eight sampling resultsare as high as 737 mg/m\3\, 633  mg/m\3\, and 514 mg/m\3\. Consequently,OSHA cannot correlate information concerning existing controls with adequatedata reflecting employee exposure levels operation by operation. OSHA thereforefinds Plant C's data set provides very little useful information for assessingtechnological feasibility. <T3>Analyzing the Data.</T3> As indicated, the Plant A data are the mostuseable. Plant A submitted data for the years 1984-87 in nine job classifications:chemical operator, general laborer, oxide operator, packer/blender/dryer(PBD), sanitary worker, warehouseman, machinist, electrician, and maintenance(Ex. 688c; Table 1, below). OSHA has combined data for electricians withdata for maintenance, because electricians perform maintenance work. OSHAtreats another category, machinist, as having air lead levels below 50mg/m\3\.There are no monitoring data for machinist in 1986 and 1987, presumablybecause no sampling was conducted in those years due to the fact that monitoringresults in 1984 and 1985 were below the action level. In any event, theavailable data for machinists at Plant A show air lead levels below theaction level. As of 1987, a majority of all sampling results at Plant A already are below50 mg/m\3\. In the same year, geometric mean exposure levels in six ofeight job classifications also are below 50 mg/m\3\, and geometric meansin all eight are at or below 65 mg/m\3\. Moreover, in five of the sevenjob classifications for which data are provided in 1987, geometric meanexposure levels are lower than they were in 1984. In addition, the averagegeometric mean for each job classification over the four years also arequite low; they are at or below 50 mg/m\3\ in 5 of the 8 job classifications.In two of the remaining jobs the geometric mean for the four years is only55 mg/m\3\ and 59 mg/m\3\. In the other, PBD, the geometric mean for thefour years is 84 mg/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,s100,5,5,5,5,9</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Summary of Exposure Data for Plant A, 1984-87</T4><H1>Job classification \1\</H1><H1>Annual geometric mean exposure level \2\</H1><H2>1984</H2><H2>1985</H2><H2>1986</H2><H2>1987</H2><H1>Combined years \4\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chemical Operator<D>34</D><D>30</D><D>44</D><D>35</D><D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Oxide Operator<D>38</D><D>51</D><D>95</D><D>62</D><D>59</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Packer/Blender/Dryer Operator (PBD)<D>68</D><D>79</D><D>121</D><D>65</D><D>84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Warehouseman<D>22</D><D>36</D><D>40</D><D>6</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">General Laborer<D>47</D><D>78</D><D>95</D><D>19</D><D>55</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sanitary Worker<D>54</D><D>26</D><D>61</D><D>8</D><D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maintenance<D>34</D><D>27</D><D>82</D><D>22</D><D>46</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Combined Jobs \3\<D>42</D><D>44</D><D>80</D><D>34</D><D>49</D><F>\1\ The job classification of ``machinist'' was not included in thistable.</F><F>\2\ For purposes of calculating geometric means, exposure monitoringresults of 0 </F>mg/m\3\ were treated as 1 mg/m\3\, which is approximatelyone-half the level of detectability.<F>\3\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Jobs'' is the geometric mean forall observations across all job categories for that year.</F><F>\4\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Years'' is the geometric meanfor all observations across all years.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Data from Plant M confirm that by 1987 levels at or around 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\already are being achieved in packaging at plants with better controlsin the industry (Ex. 688d; see Table 2, below). These data further indicatethat exposure levels for all other job classifications in this lead stabilizerplant also are being controlled fairly consistently to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.For example, in both 1986 and 1987 two-thirds of all sampling results werebelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. This represents a doubling of the proportion ofsampling results below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ since 1984. Moreover, in 1987 geometricmean exposure levels in all job classifications were at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,and the geometric mean for all lead-exposed jobs was only 18 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In 1986, geometric mean exposure levels in all jobs except packer werebelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the geometric mean for all lead-exposed jobswas 15 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In 1986, the packer had a geometric mean exposurelevel of 83 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,s10,5,5,9 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._ <T4>Summary of Exposure Data for Plant M in 1986-87 </T4><H1>Job classification</H1><H1>Annual geometric mean exposure level \1\ </H1><H2>1986</H2><H2>1987</H2><H1>Combined Years \3\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Production operator <D>18 </D><D>23 </D><D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Production foreman <D>5 </D><D>6 </D><D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Packer <D>83 </D><D>50 </D><D>64 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Packing foreman <D>6 </D><D>15 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Warehouse worker <D>8 </D><D>15 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maintenance <D>46 </D><D>32 </D><D>39 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Combined jobs \2\ <D>15 </D><D>18 </D><D>17 </D><F>\1\ For purposes of calculating geometric means, exposure monitoringresults of 0 andCx.18;g/m\3\ were treated as 1 andCx.18;g/m\3\, which is approximatelyone-half the level of detectability. </F><F>\2\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Jobs'' is the geometric mean forall observations across all job categories for that year. </F><F>\3\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Years'' is the geometric meanfor all observations across all years.</F></ITAG></ITAG> At Plant B, like Plant M, a much newer plant than Plant A, exposure levelsunaccountably tend to be considerably higher than at either of the othertwo (Ex. 684b). Nonetheless, from 1985 through 1987, in 3 of the 4 jobclassifications geometric mean exposure levels are all below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Only the job classification of operator has a geometric mean that is over100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in most years. Moreover, there is a striking trend atPlant B for all four job classifications: the geometric mean exposure levelshave been reduced dramatically since 1984. On the average, exposure levelshave been halved, with reductions ranging from 27% in maintenance to 80%for leadman (See Table 3, below). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,s100,5,5,5,5,9 </C><T4>Table </T4>3._ <T4>Summary of Exposure Data for Plant B, 1984-87 </T4><H1>Job classification </H1><H1>Annual Geometric Mean Exposure Level </H1><H2>1984 </H2><H2>1985 </H2><H2>1986 </H2><H2>1987 </H2><H1>Combined Years \2\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Operator <D>176 </D><D>119 </D><D>84 </D><D>103 </D><D>115 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shipper <D>94 </D><D>46 </D><D>88 </D><D>59 </D><D>68 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maintenance <D>125 </D><D>63 </D><D>92 </D><D>91 </D><D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Leadman (Supervisor) <D>146 </D><D>90 </D><D>51 </D><D>29 </D><D>66 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Combined Jobs \1\ <D>144 </D><D>85 </D><D>77 </D><D>73 </D><D>90 </D><F>\1\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Jobs'' is the geometric mean forall observations across all job categories for that year. </F><F>\2\ The geometric mean for ``Combined Years'' is the geometric meanfor all observations across all years.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The most important point to make about the Plant B data is that exposurelevels for operators are higher than they would otherwise be if operatorsperformed only typical operator tasks. At Plant B operators are rotatedinto the packaging operation to pack out product in small bags and drums(Ex. 684b, p. 3), and packaging probably constitutes the main source ofoperators' lead exposure. OSHA has reached this conclusion for the following reasons. Plant B hasno separate job classification for packers. Yet the company concedes thatapproximately 15% of its product is packed out in bags and drums and thatpackaging is one of the two main sources of lead emissions in the plant(Ex. 684b, p. 9). Thus, employees not designated as packers must act aspackers for a significant part of the time. The company also indicatesthat it rotates various employees into packaging to limit each employee'sexposure to lead (e.g., Exs. 686E, p. 28; 694-9, Att. 6, p. 31). Sincethe company is unlikely to routinely rotate supervisors (i.e., leadmen)or maintenance workers into such a production job, packaging must be doneby operators and/or shippers. Because operators usually have much higheraverage and geometric mean exposure levels than shippers, OSHA concludesthat operators probably perform the bulk of the packaging. A substantialreduction in lead emissions from packaging, therefore, is likely to substantiallyreduce the exposures of all workers who pack, especially the exposuresof operators, the workers with the highest lead exposures in the plant.The final data set that OSHA wishes to discuss further is from Plant X.That plant's data reflect exposure levels that are extremely high. Monitoringresults indicate that the plant frequently exceeds the applicable PEL of200 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For example, the average exposure level for all lead-exposedemployees was 237 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1987 (Ex. 688e). Based upon its analysis of data, including data from Plant A, another olderplant, OSHA believes that exposures in Plant X can be much more effectivelycontrolled and concludes that the high exposure levels at Plant X can onlybe attributed to poor controls. OSHA, therefore, does not rely on PlantX data to determine the limits of technological feasibility. Rather, OSHArelies on the data from Plant A as indicative of what can be achieved evenin old plants in the industry.In addition to the data discussed above, OSHA also was informed by thepresident of the parent company of Plant C that at its three other plantsthe company already is achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations exceptmaintenance and packaging (Ex. 684c, p. 5). In the 3 plants achieving thislevel, all product is shipped in bulk and no packaging is carried out.The president further informed OSHA that, after moving Plant C into a newfacility, he also expects to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operationsthere, except for maintenance and packaging, since it is expected that5% of the product will continue to be packaged in drums. The presidentalso stated emphatically that in 5 years or less all of his employees,with the exception of maintenance workers and non-bulk packers, would haveexposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 684c, pp. 1 and 5). Thus, in 6 of the 8 plants owned by the three major companies in the industry(i.e., Plant A, Plant M, and the four facilities operated by the ownerof Plant C), exposure levels either already are, or in the foreseeablefuture will be controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in almost all operations.In its analysis of exposure levels, OSHA has relied to a considerable extenton the geometric mean. As indicated in the introduction to the assessmentof technological feasibility, OSHA recognizes that there is no single number,or even range of numbers, that can perfectly characterize a data set. Amere range of exposure levels (e.g., from 8 andCx.18;g/m\3\ to 579 andCx.18;g/m\3\for operator at Plant B in 1987; Ex. 684b), provides very little usefulinformation about typical exposure levels. Similarly, the arithmetic mean,which is equivalent to the commonly used ``average,'' provides little insightinto the distribution of exposures and is subject to gross distortion byhigh or low numbers. Thus, for example, at Plant A in 1987, more than 60% of the 31 samplingresults for maintenance workers are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, but the arithmeticmean is 152 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 688c). This is simply because one resultis 1,715. By contrast, the geometric mean is 22 andCx.18;g/m\3\, which moreaccurately reflects routine exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA believesthat where data sets are lognormally distributed, as is typically the casewith exposure data, the geometric mean is the best single statistic tosummarize the data set. The commenter for Company B appears to agree: ``Thegeometric mean may be the best method to analyze the lead exposure data''(Ex. 694-9, Comments by Company B, p. 15, and see p. 21). OSHA is further assured of the reasonableness of relying upon a geometricmean by the fact that it appears to fit well with the court's definitionof feasibility. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1272. For a PEL to be technologically feasible,the court does not require that all operations be able to achieve the PELall of the time. Consequently, the mere existence of aberrant exposurereadings does not constitute proof of infeasibility. In using the geometric mean to characterize exposure data, the outliersthat are discounted include both high and low monitoring results. Veryhigh monitoring results can affect the mean more than low results, becauseon the low side monitoring results cannot fall below zero. Extremely high,atypical exposure levels often are caused by unusual events, like operationupsets and spills or monitoring problems, such as ``a piece of particulategetting into the sample'' (Ex. 684e, p. 7; Tr. 1176). Without knowing thecause of these extreme values, OSHA believes it is inappropriate to usethe arithmetic mean. OSHA's use of the geometric mean is also supportedby the opinions of some representatives of the lead industries and by Meridian(e.g., Exs. 581-4-B, p. 4; 694-6. p. 2; 686A, p. 12-13). Therefore, OSHAprimarily uses the geometric mean in its feasibility analysis. <T3>Current Controls. </T3>OSHA's discussion of current exposure levelsin the previous section indicates that in 1987 with existing controls PlantA, an old plant, already had a majority of all sampling results below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ and geometric mean exposure levels in 6 of 8 job classificationsbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. It also indicates that in 6 of 8 plants owned bythe three major producers in the industry, which represent over 80% ofall production, exposure levels already have been, or in the foreseeablefuture will be controlled with existing controls to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\most of the time in most operations. The primary methods currently used to control air lead levels to theseexposure levels are dust collection systems, ventilation, housekeeping,and replacement of packaging product in bags and drums, which requiresmanual intervention, with bulk and semi-bulk shipment. In addition, atleast Plant A has developed reduced-dust products that should reduce exposurelevels in packaging and perhaps other operations (Ex. 684a, p. 14). Meridian reports that in general the level of controls is considerablyhigher in relatively new plants than in old ones. For example, Meridianreports that in new plants housekeeping and preventive maintenance programsgenerally are better by a substantial margin. In addition, in relativelynew plants most major pieces of equipment and packaging are ventilatedand either fully or partially enclosed.OSHA's best information on existing controls comes from its site visitsto Plant A, Plant B and Plant C. OSHA believes the controls in place atall three companies are conventional in character and readily availablein the marketplace. At Plant B, for example, the only relatively new plantamong the three OSHA visited, prevailing engineering controls have beenin place since 1974 and are therefore extremely likely to be part of commonknowledge in the industry. Based upon this information, OSHA finds thefollowing current controls in the various operations. <T3>General Building. </T3>Both Plant A and Plant B provide general dilutionventilation with roof exhaust fans (Exs. 684a; 684b). This system is designedto provide a minimal level of air flow throughout the building and is notintended to provide control of lead contamination at specific locations.At Plant A makeup air for this system is provided by open building doors(Ex. 684a, p. 10). At Plant B the building, as well as the equipment, ismaintained under negative pressure by exhaust fans, most of which are linkedto the production equipment, which draws air in from surrounding areas(Ex. 684b, p. 5). <T3>Dry Process. </T3>The primary method both for processing lead oxidesand chemicals and for controlling lead emissions during production is adust collection system. The system is designed to collect the dust productthroughout the production process from most major pieces of equipment,conveyors and product packaging machines. At Plant A, for example, eachmajor piece of equipment (e.g., Barton pots, calcining furnaces, weighinghoppers) is connected to exhaust and collection systems to draw dust throughcollection ducts surrounding the equipment to product collection vessels(e.g., cyclones). From the final collector, a baghouse, the air is exhaustedto the outside atmosphere by an exhaust blower (Ex. 684a, pp. 10-11). The dust collection system is in place over some equipment (e.g., Bartonpots) primarily for production reasons, because it is part of the processby which lead oxide is produced from molten lead. However, since equipmentconnected to the system must be enclosed and ventilated for the systemto work, the system simultaneously operates as a method for controllingair lead levels. In some instances (e.g., melting pot, weighing hoppers),the system is installed primarily for control reasons, to prevent tracesof lead dust from escaping. The collection of product then is incidentaland minor. In addition, the process of producing lead oxide by a dust collection methodis continuous and automated. No manual handling of lead-bearing materialsis required after workers load pigs and ingots into the melting pots untilthe products are packaged or loaded for shipment. Thus, potentially highexposures associated with manual and batch processing are avoided. a. Lead Oxide Production: Although there is relatively little informationin the record on controls used in the receiving area, industry has notindicated that this operation poses an exposure problem. However, whilethe receiving operation does not generate lead dust directly, it may reentrainlead dust previously deposited in that work area from elsewhere. The facilityat Plant B has been constructed to allow rail cars delivering lead pigsand ingots to park inside the production area near the lead oxide operation.This design reduces forklift traffic, which can reentrain and dispersedust. The pigs and ingots are unloaded on the floor near the melting pots.Plant B controls this potential for dispersing deposited dust by wet-scrubbingand vacuuming the floors daily (Ex. 684b, pp. 1-2). Similarly, industry has not indicated that conveying lead ingots and pigsto melting pots poses any exposure problems. At Plant A, 100-pound pigsare manually loaded on open conveyors and continuously fed to the meltingpots. The melting pots at both Plant A and Plant B are at least partially enclosedand ventilated. At Plant A, the melting pots are provided with canopy hoods,which are connected to the dust collection system. The melting pots atPlant B are maintained at negative pressure, which is created by the exhaustfrom the dust collection system to facilitate capture of lead emissions.At Plant B, however, the enclosures around the melting pots are openedduring charging (Ex. 684b, p. 8). The melting pots at Plant C are neitherenclosed nor ventilated, but local side draft ventilation is provided (Ex.684c, p. 3). Meridian reports that completely modernized plants have replacedmelting pots with electric furnaces, which eliminates the need for drossingoff impurities (Ex. 686E, p. 29).For drossing the melting pots none of the site visit companies have implementedeither engineering controls or automation. In addition, at Plant C thereis no hood or cover on the dross pot. To control lead emission during the transfer of molten lead from the meltingpots to the Barton pots, Plant B has enclosed and ventilated the transfertroughs (Ex. 684b, p. 8). At both Plant A and Plant C the transfer troughsare open and not ventilated (Exs. 684a, p. 10; 684c, p. 3). The Barton pots/reactors at all three site visit companies are completelyenclosed and ventilated to the dust collection system. At C, however, thesite visit team observed fumes escaping from the Barton pot. In additionto controlling employee exposures with point source ventilation, PlantC has an enclosed and heated control room near the furnaces (Ex. 684c,p. 3). All three site-visited companies have fully enclosed and ventilated screwconveyors to transport the product to storage, milling and packaging. Thescrew conveyors at Plant A and Plant B are ventilated to the dust collectionsystem. At Plant A, however, the site visit team observed dust emissionsat the ends of conveyors, where worn out bearings had allowed lead oxidedust to spill out onto the floor (Ex. 684a, p. 10). Meridian reports thatcompletely modernized plants have replaced screw conveyors with pneumaticconveyors to more completely control lead emissions (Sx. 686E, p. 29).Pneumatic conveyors, which use air to move materials through the conveyor,are fully enclosed and operate at negative pressure, have considerablyfewer leaks and breakdowns, and require less repair and maintenance thanscrew conveyors and other mechanized material transfer systems. b. Calcining Furnaces: Exposure levels at calcining furnaces at Plant Aand Plant B are controlled by maintaining the furnace under negative pressure.At Plant A calcining furnaces operate at negative pressure because theflue gas from the furnace has to be exhausted to the atmosphere throughbaghouses. No engineering controls have been implemented to control quality controlsampling at the calcining furnaces. Plant A reports that all quality controlsamplers are thoroughly trained in sampling techniques. c. Grinding and Blending: Exposure levels are controlled in grinding andblending because the grinding mills are enclosed and ventilated to thedust collection system. Thus, they also operate at negative pressure. Insome plants bag dumping stations for loading blenders are also exhaustventilated. d. Packaging: In packaging, the most difficult exposure problem is limitedto packaging the product in paper bags. To a very substantial extent leadchemical producers have eliminated this high exposure problem by switchingfrom packaging in paper bags and drums, which requires extensive manualintervention, to bulk shipment. At Plant B, for instance, 85% of its productis bulk shipped (Ex. 684b, p. 3). At Plant C less than 5% of its productis packaged in drums, and at the company's three other plants all productis shipped exclusively in bulk. The company owning Plant C has successfullyconverted almost entirely to bulk shipment in part because the companyhas helped its customers to install bulk handling systems (Ex. 684c, pp.2, 5). In addition to bulk shipping a substantial portion of their product, plantsalso are controlling exposure levels in packaging by shipping a portionof product in semi-bulk form in superbags or supersacks, which can holdup to a few thousand pounds. Like bulk shipping, superbags do not requiremanual weight adjustment. To fill these containers a worker must placethe clean bag opening around the fill spout and start the flow of material.At Plant A, lead emissions are controlled during filling because the connectionbetween the bag and the fill spout is gasketed to achieve a tight seal(Ex. 684a, p. 4). In addition, the displaced air in the superbag is exhaustventilated to the dust collection system. After the superbag is filledand sealed, it is removed from the area by a forklift truck. To controlexposure levels during cleaning of reusable superbags, Plant B washes thebags in an isolated room (Ex. 684b, p. 9). A portion of the product at the three visited companies is packaged indrums. Although this packaging method requires some manual intervention(e.g., skimming off the product from the drum), it does not have the highexposure problems associated with packaging in paper bags. During drumpackaging at Plant A, the product is transferred from packaging hoppersto the drum in an enclosure that is exhaust ventilated to a bag filter.The enclosure draws air at a face velocity of 200 fpm and is open in frontto allow drum placement and removal (Ex. 684a, pp. 3, 11). Drum packagingat Plant B is also enclosed and exhaust ventilated (Ex. 684b, p. 8). Both Plant A and Plant B clean and reuse drums, an operation which posesadditional exposure problems. Neither company cleans drums in an isolatedroom or building. Plant B, however, has targeted a program to isolate andcontrol the cleaning of used drums as a part of its modernization projectfor that facility (Ex. 684b, p. 10). Currently, at Plant B dirty drumsare cleaned with a high vacuum cleaning system in a reserved but open areaof the plant. In the warehouse and production area at Plant A the sitevisit team observed drums waiting to be cleaned for reuse (Ex. 684a, p.11). Plant A cleans the sides of drums with vacuums before replacing thelid and sealing the top of the drum. Plant C has eliminated this exposureproblem by not reusing drums (Ex. 684c, p. 2). Where packaging is done in paper bags, air lead levels are controlled byenclosing and ventilating the operation. At Plant A the enclosure is ventilatedat a face velocity of 200 fpm and the scale for weighing bag contents iswithin the enclosure (Ex. 684a, p. 11). At Plant B, however, the fillingstation is only partially enclosed and the transfer between the fillingand weighing stations is not exhaust ventilated. At both Plant A and PlantB the site visit team observed emissions from the paper bags during weighing,closing and placing the bags on the pallets (Exs. 684a, p. 11; 684b, p.8). In addition, at Plant A the site visit team observed workers dustingthe paper bags, scales and filling stations with hand brooms Ex. 684a,p. 12).Among plants, there are wide variations in bagging machines and ventilationfor bagging machines (Ex. 582-90, App. C). Some bagging machines allowfor reversal of the rotation of the filling auger when bag weight is reachedto prevent material dropping from the filling spout when the bag is removed.Other bagging machines have an exhaust line into the bag to remove displacedair as the bag is filled to prevent puffs when the bag is removed fromthe filling spout. Some companies have modified bagging machines to improvethe precision of delivered weight in order to reduce the need for manualweight adjustment. Other companies have experimented with design and installationof small local exhaust hoods and slots around filling spouts to capturedust generated from the bagging machine. <T3>Wet Process. </T3>In wet processing, according to Plant A representatives,wetting tanks, reactors and storage tanks do not require exhaust ventilationbecause the wet product does not cause exposure to lead dust or fume. PlantA stated, nonetheless, that the reactor is fully enclosed and the dooris removed only for taking quality control samples. At Plant A, the sitevisit team observed some dry residue in the reactor area that was probablythe result of quality control sampling. In the dry end of the wet processat Plant A, screw conveyors, weighing hoppers, dryers and mills are equippedwith exhaust ventilation and dust collection devices (Ex. 684a, p. 11).<T3>Maintenance and Housekeeping. </T3>To prevent reentrainment of leaddust, Plant A's production area is cleaned twice a week with a centralvacuum system and mobile vacuum units. In addition, each employee is responsiblefor routine housekeeping in his work area. Several times per week, eachemployee also performs general housekeeping, which includes mopping andvacuuming the floor and other surfaces in his work station (Ex. 684a, p.12). At Plant B, wet scrubbers and stationary vacuums are used to cleanwork areas (Ex. 684b, p. 9). In addition to routine housekeeping, both Plant A and Plant B have scheduledprograms for plant-wide housekeeping. Plant B now conducts an annual plantcleanup, which includes rafters, during its shutdown time (Ex. 684b, p.9). Plant A performs biannual plant-wide cleanups, which are not, however,``rafters-to-basement'' cleanups. Plant A does not have an effective regulardust pile inspection program to identify problems with equipment or maintenancethat needs attention (Ex. 684a, pp. 12-13). <T3>Additional Controls_Introduction. </T3>In the previous sections, OSHAhas shown that with existing controls in 6 of the 8 plants owned by thethree major producers in the industry, exposure levels already have been,or in the foreseeable future will be controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\most of the time in most of the operations. More specifically, OSHA has shown that at Plant A, an old plant, in 1987a majority of all sampling results already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ andgeometric mean exposure levels in six of eight job classifications alsoare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In the most difficult operation to controlto 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, PBD, the geometric mean is only 65 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Although the data for 1987 are somewhat lower than for previous years,geometric means for the past four years also are quite low. In 5 of 8 jobclassifications, the geometric mean for 5 of 8 job classifications overthe four years are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\; in two of the remainingthree they are 55 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 59 andCx.18;g/m\3\; and none is above84 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (PBD). OSHA also has shown that at Plant M, a newer plant manufacturing lead stabilizers,geometric mean exposure levels by 1987 had been controlled to 50  andCx.18;g/m\3\or below in all job classifications. OSHA believes that for job classifications and operations where most samplingresults or geometric means already are near or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,relatively modest improvements in controls (e.g., improved housekeeping,better preventive maintenance, installing baffles to stop cross drafts,or covering dross buckets) will be sufficient to consistently control airlead levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarly, for operations wheremost of the sampling results or geometric means already are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\,OSHA believes that a combination of limited additional and improved controls(e.g., improving the efficiency of the ventilation system), will be sufficientto control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The Agency's discussion of the reductions in air lead levels expected tobe achieved by implementing recommended controls relies in part on assessmentsmade by a panel of three certified industrial hygienists established byOSHA's contractor, Meridian (Ex. 686E, pp. 23-30 and App. A). The panel'sassessments are based upon data in the record; site visits to three plants;and the members' extensive experience and expertise as industrial hygienists.Although quantification of the estimated reductions involves a substantialamount of expert judgment, OSHA believes that the panel's assessments,on the whole, are the best available evidence in the record concerningthe reductions in exposure levels that reasonably can be expected fromimplementing recommended additional and improved controls. OSHA, based on its own experience and expertise, therefore believes thatreliance in part upon the panel and Meridian for the Agency's feasibilitydetermination is entirely reasonable. In any event, OSHA has independentlyevaluated the record evidence and does not always concur with their judgments.For example, OSHA in its own analysis places greater emphasis than Meridiandoes on modernizing the packaging operation and replacing mechanical materialstransfer conveyors with pneumatic material transfer systems. Contrary toMeridian, OSHA also has concluded from the record that, notwithstandingsubstantial differences between newer and older plants, the age of existingplants is not determinative of a plant's ability to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.For example, as OSHA has already shown. Plant A, an older plant, is alreadycontrolling air lead levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, while the relativelynewer Plant B plant has not yet reduced its lead exposures to those levels.On the whole, the same sorts of controls that have been successfully utilizedto achieve exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at Plant A and PlantM and elsewhere are precisely the kinds of additional controls that OSHArecommends to reduce remaining excess air lead levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<T3>Recommended Integrated System of Controls. </T3>As discussed at greaterlength below in the concluding section on technological feasibility, OSHAbelieves that effectively controlling air lead levels involves more thanpiecemeal efforts at implementing individual additional controls. It involvesimplementing an integrated system of controls. That system is composedof three elements. The basic element is an industrial hygiene study. Thesecond element is the development of good written housekeeping and workpractice programs that are systematically implemented so that proper proceduresare routinely and meticulously followed. The final element of an integratedsystem of controls is a preventive maintenance program to assure that allsystems are maintained in clean and efficient condition.To understand the nature of exposure problems in a plant and to designand implement effective methods to control lead emissions, OSHA believesthat an effective control program would include as a first step obtainingthe services of a competent industrial hygienist to perform a plant-wideindustrial hygiene study. The study should focus on a task-by-task analysisof sources of lead emission in the plant and an analysis of cross draftsas potential sources of cross contamination in order to design measuresto control and/or eliminate these sources.Site visits in early 1988 to Plant A, to Plant B, to Plant C and discussionson site with industry representatives made OSHA and Meridian aware of theneed for such studies. As Meridian has pointed out, at each plant the sitevisit team found plant personnel who were extremely knowledgeable aboutproduction-related matters but were ``surprisingly uninformed about industrialhygiene'' (Ex. 686E, p. 29).At Plant C, for example, the president of the company insisted that areasamples were preferable to personal samples because they are ``more reliable''(Ex. 686E, p. 29). Moreover, at no visited plant was air lead monitoringbeing conducted by people trained in industrial hygiene, and at no visitedplant had any systematic task analysis been performed to determine thecontribution of various task elements to employee lead exposure.At Plant B, company representatives reported that no industrial hygienetask analysis sampling had ever been performed at any of the company'sfacilities (Ex. 684b, p. 4). (This statement was subsequently partiallyqualified when the company stated that task analysis sampling had beenperformed at another, unidentified lead chemicals plant owned by the company(Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, p. 33).Similarly, it appears that no industrial hygiene survey had been initiatedat Plant A until just prior to the November 1987 public hearing in thisrulemaking. Then, the company apparently consulted an industrial hygienist(IH), who reportedly recommended that the company have a job/task analysisperformed. Although the company did not submit a copy of any of the IH'spreliminary analyses or recommendations to the record, Plant A indicatesit was undergoing a plant-wide task analysis in the spring of 1988 (Ex.694-9, Att. 5, pp. 7-8). OSHA applauds this effort and considers it likelyto be very helpful in further reducing employee exposure to lead.OSHA believes that, to the extent feasible, each source contributing morethan an insignificant amount to workers lead exposures must be controlled,because the combined effect of controlling a number of sources of limitedexposure can be very significant. For example, during OSHA's visit to PlantA, one of the certified industrial hygienists on the site visit team commentedthat he saw ``more than a hundred industrial hygiene opportunities'' toreduce workers' air lead levels (Ex. 686E, p. 25). OSHA notes that if onlyhalf of those opportunities (50) were investigated and pursued and onlyhalf of that number (25) each resulted in a mere 1 mg/m\3\ reduction inTWA exposure levels, then total plant-wide emissions at Plant A could bereduced by 25 mg/m\3\ in any eight-hour period. OSHA does not believe thatthe TWAs of any workers would be reduced to the full extent of the multiplereductions. Workers who were affected to lesser degrees would have theirTWAs proportionally reduced.OSHA is confident that an industrial hygiene study is essential to systematicallycontrol air lead levels in this industry. It is a precondition for institutingan effective, regular program to identify the precise sources of exposureand reasons for upset conditions and to control them. Meridian has statedit believes that hiring a certified industrial hygienist to perform sucha full-plant survey is a ``relatively low-cost approach to the problemof over exposure'', which ``could produce dramatic reductions in theseexposures'' (Ex. 686E, p. 29). OSHA agrees.A simple example should suffice to show how useful such a survey can be.Cross contamination appears to be a problem in the lead chemicals industry(e.g., Ex. 684a, p. 13), although the extent of the problem in individualplants is unknown. It is not surprising that cross contamination is a problemsince operations throughout the industry generally are in large open buildingsand are not separately enclosed. Cross contamination exists where plantshave failed to adequately contain lead exposures at their primary sourceand cross drafts disperse escaping lead fume and/or dust into other areasor throughout the plant. By implementing proper controls, cross contaminationcan be eliminated or at least dramatically reduced.Cross drafts are caused by a variety of factors. Windows or doors leftopen, use of man-cooling fans, and reliance upon natural ventilation withseasonal variation, especially in open plants, all can create cross drafts.However, even in plants that have eliminated these obvious sources of crossdrafts, cross drafts still can be produced by air transfers between hotand cold operations and imbalances in the mechanical ventilation system.Cross drafts spread contamination from one operation to another. In addition,and less obviously, they also compromise local exhaust ventilation, preventingexhaust hoods from operating at maximum capacity. OSHA's evaluation ofthe complex, plant-wide problems that cross drafts create is substantiatedby the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' book,<T3>Industrial Ventilation, </T3>which states that ``[c]ross drafts notonly interfere with the proper operation of exhaust hoods, but also maydisperse contaminated air from one section of the building into anotherand can interfere with the proper operation of process equipment'' (Ex.583-13, p. 7-2). To control cross contamination simple steps may be effective. For example,fully enclosing and ventilating a potential source of cross contamination,like the packaging operation, will prevent the dispersion of lead. Erectingcross barriers at proper locations, eliminating windows, and using airlocks for entryways not only will decrease cross contamination, but alsowill increase the efficiency of exhaust hoods. An industrial hygiene surveycan identify the source and nature of cross contamination and can locatethe proper sites to locate barriers and other controls. OSHA's conclusion that an industrial hygiene study is needed is supportedby Mr. Knowlton Caplan, a well-known engineering consultant to the leadindustry. Mr. Caplan has said that engineering controls should be designedwith industrial hygiene problems in mind (Ex. 582-89, Appendix). An industrial hygiene study will indicate which controls need to be implementedin particular plants. The main controls are local exhaust ventilation,enclosure and isolation, plant design, automation built into the productionprocess, and work practices, including housekeeping and maintenance. <T3>Ventilation. </T3>The presence of excessive lead in the work environmentsof lead chemical plants indicates that existing engineering controls likelocal exhaust ventilation (LEV) and general ventilation are not doing thejob. Much more quantitative and other information than are available inthe record would be needed to state with any precision how great a reductionin any particular exposure level could be achieved by enhancing specificventilation systems. Nonetheless, OSHA has no doubt that in many operationsimproved or additional ventilation can achieve major reductions in workerexposure. Such controls have been developed, tested, and where found effective, manufacturedand applied widely for many years throughout industry to control specificcontaminants. Conventional controls for various operations in the leadindustries have been described in detail and often depicted in photographsor diagrams by industrial hygienists and engineers from the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (Ex. 583-13, pp. 5-34 to 5-37, 5-102,5-105), AFS (Exs. 689-4A; 689-4F), American National Standards Institute(Exs. 689-13A, 13B, 13C). Many consultants who have worked for OSHA orindustry also have recommended such controls (Exs. 689-6; 689-7; 689-8;689-9; 689-10; 689-11; 689-12). LIA agrees that ventilation controls usedin the lead chemicals industry are basically the same as those used inother industries (Ex. 582-90, p. 9). Thus, in terms of ventilation, thereis nothing unique about lead chemical production. Specifically, improved or additional ventilation can achieve major reductionsin air lead levels in packaging operations throughout the lead chemicalsindustry. At Plant A, for example, enclosing the packaging, weighing andpalletizing elements of the operation in a properly designed and maintainedside-ventilated booth could dramatically reduce air lead levels (Ex. 686E,p. 24). <T3>Enclosure and Isolation. </T3>Enclosure and isolation are two alternativemethods of separating workers from air contaminants. In the case of isolation,the employee is physically separated from contaminants in the air; e.g.,by working in a filtered, ventilated control booth (Ex. 689-4D, fig. 32).This method is being applied by Company C at one site visited by OSHA inthe construction of their new plant (Ex. 684c, p. 6). With enclosure, thesource of the contaminant is physically contained and separated from therest of the work environment to prevent contamination of the air (e.g.,Ex. 586-18, figs. 1 and 2). Sometimes, enclosures consist simply of topsinstalled on vessels containing molten metal (e.g., covering dross buckets;Ex. 583-16, p. 24). Docket entries describe standard enclosure techniques that are in use inthe industry or can be readily implemented (e.g., enclosing the transfertrough from the melt pot to the kettle or enclosing conveyors; Ex. 684b,p. 8). Simple isolation techniques that have been successfully used incertain plants in this and other lead industries also are applicable throughoutthis industry (e.g., providing employees with filtered, ventilated cabsfor mobile equipment, isolation booths and control rooms; Exs. 684c. p.6; 689-4D, p. 7-14, figs. 31, 32). Isolating workers for even a portion of their shift can significantly reduceexposure levels. For example, a Radian study of a secondary lead smelterdemonstrates that employee exposures can be reduced by 23-77% even whenemployees spend only a portion of the workday in an isolation booth (Ex.583-16, p. 30). Another study, by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH), investigating the effectiveness of various controltechnologies in secondary lead smelters, reports that workers spendingeven one-quarter of their time in a supplied air island would experiencea 20% reduction in their 8-hour TWA exposure levels (Ex. 590, p. 40). <T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices, and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices, and preventive maintenance are critically important controls,the importance of which frequently is not adequately recognized by employers.Failure to develop and use rigorous housekeeping, good work practices,and preventive maintenance can destroy the effectiveness of otherwise adequateengineering controls. OSHA believes that improved work practices, housekeeping,and more rigorous maintenance practices are among the principal tools forachieving compliance with the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL in existing lead chemicalplants.The importance of housekeeping measures in general was stressed in a reportprepared by the Cadre Corporation for a secondary copper smelter (Ex. 475-32D).The Cadre report states,<ITAG tagnum="20">[Housekeeping] is definitely the most underrated aspect of any fumeabatement program. In any industrial facility there will be some amountof particulate in the air. Sooner or later this particulate is going tosettle out on the plant floor, equipment and materials. If this dust isnot collected and disposed of then it will become airborne again due tobuilding drafts, mobile machinery traffic and numerous other disturbances.The housekeeping component of the abatement plan is a vital link in thesuccess of the project. By neglecting to properly control settled particulateany gains made by capturing fugitive emissions will be minimal.</ITAG>OSHA agrees. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of good housekeepingand work practices. Lead oxide products, which are fine dusts with averageparticle sizes of a few microns, are readily dispersed by air currents.A small amount of lead dispersed throughout a building's air space mayraise the airborne level over the PEL. Obviously, to avoid exceeding thePEL, process operations not only must be tightly enclosed, but emissionsor spills from equipment breakdowns, maintenance operations, broken bagsor any other sources also must be promptly contained and cleaned up tominimize dispersion throughout the workplace. Housekeeping in lead chemical plants needs to be improved. For example,Plant A has never had a complete rafters-to-basement cleaning (Ex. 684a,p. 12). It should have one and repeat it at least annually. Moreover, smallpiles of dust were observed in many places on floors at Plant A, especiallyunder MMTS, and on other surfaces (Ex. 684a, p. 13). The housekeeping programshould prevent the accumulation of such piles of dust and effectively providefor their prompt removal if they nonetheless occur. In addition, the packerwas observed using a hand broom to sweep product dust off a bag and offthe work station (Ex. 684a, p. 12). This practice, which contributes tothe packer's own exposure to lead and may also disperse lead dust morebroadly, should be discontinued. Thus, in practice Plant A's housekeepingprogram appears to be seriously inadequate. Similarly, at Plant C housekeeping also was poor. The site visit team observedextensive accumulations of lead-containing dust on the floor, in guttersand on conveying and other equipment. Lead ingots were covered with oxidedust. There was no regularly scheduled program of housekeeping (Ex. 686E,p. 25). In contrast, housekeeping at Plant B generally appeared to be considerablybetter than at the other two plants. The company reportedly had recentlyinstituted a documented, scheduled program of housekeeping, including cleaningthe rafters (Ex. 684b, p. 9). Nevertheless, the company apparently continuedto clean used, product-contaminated drums returned by customers in theopen production area. This practice, the team judged, added directly tothe plant's background level of contamination and thereby to the exposuresof all employees in the area (Ex. 686E, p. 27). By implementing strict housekeeping proceedures, segregating housekeepingactivities and assigning them to a trained housekeeping staff, and by effectivelyimplmenting a regular spill detection program and periodic cleanup program,the expert industrial hygiene panel estimated that exposure levels of allproduction employees at Plant A could be reduced by over 60% (Ex. 686E,App. A, A-1). By implementing a similar, strict program of regular housekeepingat Plant C, the panel estimated that workers exposure to lead could bereduced by 24% (Ex. 686E, App. A, A-3). With the new rafter cleaning programat Plant B and by ceasing to accept returned, contaminated drums or byautomating their cleaning or at least by fully enclosing and locally exhaustingthe cleaning process, the expert panel anticipated a reduction in workers'exposure at Plant B of from 23 to 35% (Ex. 686E, App. A, A-2). In all plants in the industry detailed housekeeping instructions shouldbe prepared and adherence to them enforced by employers, with schedulingand checkoff of regular cleaning of all areas of the plant where dust cancollect. If necessary, housekeeping instructions should list individualsites, pieces of equipment, parts of equipment, and obscure corners (e.g.,under conveyors) to assure that they are cleaned regularly. Where necessary,a trained housekeeping staff should be hired or perhaps housekeeping shouldbe contracted out. Implementing appropriate work practice controls is also vital to achievingexposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. No matter how good engineeringcontrols may be, they often can only be as effective as the associatedwork practices that determine how they are used and where the employeelocates himself relative to the controls. For example, when packers atPlant A perform manual activities outside the effective capture zone ofthe hood, they expose themselves to lead and disperse lead dust into theair. In doing so, the local exhaust ventilation is rendered ineffective.OSHA finds this work practice unacceptable.Work practices also should be written to prescribe correct procedures forall tasks that might result in increased employee exposure. Such proceduresshould dictate, for example, that an employee not use a broom to dry sweeplead dust. These procedures might also prohibit production employees whoperform some maintenance tasks from doing so where they already have excessexposure to lead. Good work practice rules also should require that coversbe kept on quality sampling containers. They should minimize the manualhandling of bags filled with product and, when some manual handling isnecessary, assure that it is performed with care. Good work practices areparticularly important in packaging, for example, to minimize dust releasedwhen bags breathe and to minimize loose dust in the stacks of bags on pallets.Improved work practices are very important since much of workers' dailyexposure may come from brief lapses in performing their tasks. One industryspokesperson, for example, estimated that as much as 80% of a worker'sdaily exposure might come from intermittent, high-exposure, short-termactivity (Ex. 684b, p. 10).OSHA also notes the importance of maintenance programs to assure that allsystems function as cleanly and as efficiently as practicable. The capacityfor ventilation systems to protect air quality depends not only on properdesign and installation, but also on proper maintenance and availabilityof sufficient makeup air. Exhaust systems lose their capacity because beltsand pulleys slip, duct branches become clogged, duct couplings become looseand develop holes that leak air, filters become occluded, and fan bladesbecome corroded or unbalanced. Thus, the effectiveness of engineering controlscan be severely limited by poor maintenance (Exs. 582-13, pp. 10-16; 689-3,p. 74, Table 8-1; and see <T3>Safety in Metal Casting, </T3>Des Plaines, IL, Vol. 6, 1970, p. 172).Two basic principles should be applied in maintenance work. First, extremecare must be taken when doing maintenance to prevent emissions into theworkplace. Second, foreseeable equipment failures that could contributeto emissions should be minimized through a preventive maintenance program.Opening up equipment for repair may release large amounts of dust. Therefore,it is imperative to remove this dust before it permeates the workplace.Floor vacuum cleaners may not be adequate. Plant-wide vacuum systems maybe required with outlets widely distributed and hoses available so thatworkers can clean up dust any place with minimum effort immediately afterit is discovered. Maintenance workers can use the hoses as small ad hochoods to capture dust when they must break connections on lines, open upconveyors, etc. Work practices must be developed to cover the use of thevacuum system and workers must be trained to strictly follow correct practices.Maintenance workers should be trained, for example, to trap dust at connectionsthey are going to break by setting up hoses before, not after the dustinside has dropped to the floor.Preventive maintenance minimizes emissions. It is much better to shut downequipment in a controlled fashion, with lines, conveyors, vessels, etc.,cooled or emptied to make it easier to open them up with minimum contaminationof the workplace, than to have equipment fail while in operation. Bettermaintenance and better controls should reduce major housekeeping problems.In addition to the above controls, OSHA specifically recommends additionalcontrols operation by operation. On the whole, the same sorts of controlsthat have been successfully utilized to achieve exposure levels at or below50 mg/m\3\ at Plant A, Plant M and elsewhere in the industry are preciselythe kinds of controls that OSHA recommends here as additional controlsto reduce remaining air lead levels to or below 50 mg/m\3\. In its operation-by-operationanalysis, OSHA focuses on the two operations/job classifications that aregenerally regarded by industry to be the most difficult to consistentlycontrol to 50 mg/m\3\, packaging and maintenance (Exs. 582-90, p. 7; 684b,p. 9; 694-9, Att. 2-4; Tr. 1266).<T3>Packaging.</T3> ``Packaging'' refers exclusively to filling drums andpaper or plastic bags with product. Bulk shipment by railcar or truck andsemi-bulk shipment in superbags and other large containers are not consideredpackaging by industry. Packaging is viewed by industry to constitute oneof the single most difficult sources of lead to control (Exs. 582-90, p.7; 694-9, Att. 2-4; Tr. 1266).Within packaging, the main problem is limited to packing bags. Packingdrums presents much less of an exposure problem. For example, the air indrums or bags, which initially fluidizes the product as the container isfilled, slowly rises carrying dust with it as the material settles. However,with drums, the closing of the drum contains the escape of dust-laden airfrom the compacting solids. With bags, on the other hand, the escape ofair remains a major problem for packagers. Because a bag is flexible, notrigid, any pressure applied to the bag in handling causes it to breatheand may result in the emission of a puff of dust-containing air. Typicallyin the industry, bags that require precise weight specifications have beenmanually filled, manually weight adjusted, and manually closed. When suchmanual intervention is required, employees may be exposed to relativelyhigh air lead levels. Similarly, when closed bags are manually moved, workersalso may be exposed to lead dust.The problem with successfully controlling packaging needs to be put inproper perspective. First, some plants already are effectively controllingair lead levels in packaging. As shown in the previous section, by 1987in packaging Plant M achieved a geometric mean exposure level of 50 mg/m\3\,while Plant A had a geometric mean exposure level of 65 mg/m\3\. Second, the amount of product being bagged already is quite limited. Currentlyacross the industry, based on OSHA's site visit observations, it appearsthat no more than 15% of product is packaged in bags and drums. Plant Bis typical, packaging 15% of product (Ex. 684b, p. 3). Plant C is wellbelow that average, packing less than 5% of its product in drums and nothingin bags Moreover, Plant C is the only one among four plants owned by itsparent company that packages in drums or bags at all (Ex. 684c, pp. 2 and5). By contrast, at Plant A ``a substantial amount of its product,'' apparentlymore than 15%, is reported to be packaged in bags (Ex. 684a, p. 3). TheLIA confirms that bulk shipping ``is the principal means of shipment''in the industry (Ex. 582-90, p. 12).Of the approximately 15% of product packaged in bags and drums across theindustry, obviously only a part is packaged in bags. At Plant B, for example,only one-third of the packaged product is in bags (5%). Furthermore, inthe bagged segment, apparently only some customers require precise weightspecifications. OSHA therefore estimates that considerably less than 10%,and probably less than 5% of total product has to be packed in bags withprecise weight specifications. For that small proportion of product that currently continues to be packagedin bags, as well as for the portion of the product packaged in drums, OSHArecommends three methods for controlling existing lead emissions. Theyare: further reducing or eliminating packaging, and shipping still moreproduct in bulk or semi-bulk form; purchasing and installing the new highlyaccurate packaging machines and appropriately reducing the variety of packagesprovided customers; or enclosing each packing and palletizing station witha side-ventilated booth (Ex. 686E, p. 24). These control methods can beemployed independently or in combination to achieve employee exposure levelslower than 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. However, OSHA believes it is unlikely thatany facility would have to implement more than one of these recommendedcontrols to achieve this level. OSHA's preferred method for controlling exposures associated with packagingis to encourage the lead chemical industry to further reduce the amountof product that is packaged by shifting increasingly to bulk and semi-bulkshipping. The parent company of Plant C is a leader in the industry insuccessfully moving in this direction, in no small part by persuading itscustomers to shift to bulk purchases and by helping them with the shift(Ex. 684c, p. 2). OSHA applauds this achievement. OSHA believes that otherlarge producers in the industry can persuade more of their customers toaccept bulk and semi-bulk shipment, as well. However, OSHA recognizes thatthere may be some portion of product that will have to continue to be packaged.For that portion, OSHA recommends that industry implement either, or acombination of the two following control methods. The first is to mechanize and automate packaging and subsequent bag handling.For bags that do not have to be packed to precise weight specifications,conventional automatic packaging machines that fill and seal bags havebeen available and in use in many plants for years. Today, even for bagsthat require filling to precise weight specifications, automatic packagingmachines are available that, according to LIA, ``can easily achieve accuraciesof 0.25% and sometimes even * * * 0.1% * * *.'' (Ex. 582-90, App. C. p.3). This means that for a 50-pound bag, the machine can automatically fillaccurately to within 2 ounces and less and can seal, all routinely withoutmanual intervention. Based upon industry statements regarding the weighttolerances required by some customers (e.g., Tr., p. 1282), OSHA concludesthat nearly all orders can be bagged on these more accurate packaging machines.The number of bags that would still require manual weight adjustment, therefore,should be extremely small. Consequently, if achieving precise weight specifications were the onlyproblem in bagging, emissions associated with manual interventions couldbe strictly controlled or effectively eliminated by mechanization. However,customers are reported to also seek different kinds of packages (e.g.,plastic bags, paper bags, 20-pound bags, 50-pound bags). This causes aproblem, because no single machine can handle a wide variety of packages.The industry, of course, could satisfy all the packaging demands of customersand fully automate packaging by purchasing and installing a sufficientnumber of the more advanced bagging machines. The problem is not technological.The technology exists and is available. The problem is cost. Industry admitsas much: ``Packaging could be automated if industry had unlimited resources''(Ex. 582-90, p. 13). In OSHA's view, ``unlimited resources'' are not required to resolve thisproblem. Industry, for example, could provide customers with a more limitedvariety of bags and thereby reduce the number of advanced automatic baggingmachines necessary to accommodate that range. With regard to handling the bags after they have been filled and sealed,OSHA believes that such handling can be mechanized as well. Bags can bemechanically flattened and conveyed (Tr. 1283). Mechanization of this phaseof bag handling should substantially reduce worker exposure from breathingbags, because workers can be removed from proximity to these emission sources.The emissions from flattening, for example, then can be controlled by localexhaust ventilation. The last recommended method for controlling employee exposure levels inthis operation to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, is simply to improve the captureof emissions at the existing level of production mechanization by isolatingthe entire operation and providing effective local exhaust ventilation.This control strategy needs to be accompanied by the implementation ofstrict work practices and preventive maintenance to assure that local exhaustventilation is effective. To be effective, this control strategy has to take account of a numberof factors. Each of the manual tasks in packaging provides a potentialsource of lead exposure. These tasks extend all the way from placing thebag on the bagging machine, through weighing the bag contents, adjustingcontent weight, and sealing the bag, to cleaning the outside of the bagand then stacking it on a pallet. Each of these tasks must be effectivelyexhausted, and the worker must be trained to carry out each within thecapture range of the ventilation and in a manner likely to minimize theamount of lead emission. Obviously, the local exhaust also must be properlydesigned, installed, and maintained. It also must be properly located andhave sufficient capacity to handle the job. The independent panel of expert industrial hygienists gathered by Meridianhas analyzed the additional controls needed at Plant A and Plant B andhas estimated the reduction in air lead levels to be expected from implementingthem. At Plant A, where the site visit team observed small plumes of lead dustgenerated during the performance of several manual packaging tasks andobserved emissions from work done outside the ventilation enclosure (Ex.684a, p. 11), the expert panel recommended improving work practice controlsand enclosing each packaging, weighing and palletizing station within aside-ventilated booth (Ex. 686E, p. 24). With this booth, the panel estimatedthat exposure levels of the PBD would be reduced by approximately 43% (Ex.686E, pp. 24 and App. A, A-1). For Plant A, the panel further recommended that panels on ventilation ductsbe maintained, to effect enclosure and maximize capture velocity, and estimatedthat a similar reduction of 43% in worker exposure could be expected fromthat simple control. However, the company has challenged the factual basisfor this recommendation, saying that panels were missing only on ventilationsystems that were undergoing repair or no longer in use (Ex. 694-9, Att.5). Although the company's claim is at variance with the site visit team'sobservations, and OSHA believes that this potential for reduction doesexist, nonetheless the Agency's feasibility determination does not takethis into account. Nonetheless, with an anticipated reduction of 43% in exposure levels associatedwith installation of the ventilated booth, air lead levels for the packagershould be reduced to a geometric mean of 37 andCx.18;g/m\3\ if the geometricmean for 1987 is used as the base. (Air lead levels would be reduced toa geometric mean of 47 andCx.18;g/m\3\ if the four-year average geometricmean were used as the base). In addition, OSHA believes that exposure levelswould be considerably further reduced if the needed improvements in workpractice controls, which also have not been factored in to these calculations,are implemented as well. Workers, for example, should not toss bags ontothe pallet; they should not use brooms to dust off bags or their equipment.Bags, pallets, and equipment should be regularly vacuumed. Improved housekeepingshould dramatically and relatively inexpensively further reduce air leadlevels at Plant A at the packaging and other operations where the sitevisit team observed poor housekeeping. With the implementation of all ofthese controls, OSHA concludes that air lead levels at Plant A can be reducedto consistently below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the packaging operation. Plant B also should be able to reduce exposure levels in packaging to below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, by implementing additional controls. As indicated inthe section on current exposure levels, there is no job classificationat Plant B denominated ``packer.'' Operators and shippers apparently rotateto perform packaging tasks. Thus, exposure levels for employees in bothjob classifications should be substantially reduced by additional controlsin packaging. At Plant B the site visit team observed small spills of lead chemicalsand dusting during the manual weight adjustment of bag and drum contentsand small amounts of dust coming from closed, breathing bags on the palletwhen the product in them settled. To capture these and other emissions,the expert panel recommends improved ventilation of point sources and betterenclosure of the packaging, weighing and palletizing operation. From implementing these recommended additional controls, the expert panelanticipates a reduction in exposure levels for operators and shippers of75-95% (Ex. 686E, p. 28 and App. A, A-2). With geometric mean exposurelevels in 1987 of 103 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for operators and 59 andCx.18;g/m\3\for shippers, resulting geometric mean exposure levels would be reducedto 5-26 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 3-15 andCx.18;g/m\3\, respectively.However, since the panel's anticipated reductions appear to be based uponthe assumption that all of the relevant workers' lead exposure is derivedfrom packaging, and since both shippers and operators perform other tasksthat are likely to subject the worker to lead exposure, and in the caseof operators to not insignificant lead exposure, OSHA believes that thepanel's estimates may overstate the expected reduction. OSHA believes operators do most packaging, because under the circumstancesthe Agency judges the geometric mean exposure levels for shippers (e.g.,59 mg/m\3\ in 1987 and 68 mg/m\3\ for the four-year average geometric mean)to be too low to incorporate much time in packaging. Operators typicallyhave exposure levels that are almost twice as high as shippers. The percentagereduction in air lead levels expected from implementing recommended additionalcontrols in packaging can be applied only to that portion of workers' exposureattributable to packaging. OSHA calculates the expected reduction for operators under two differentassumptions. OSHA assumes that either two-thirds or three-quarters of theoperators' exposure levels come from packaging. OSHA believes that bothof these assumptions are reasonable, because, on the one hand, packagingis one of the two main sources of lead exposure at Plant B according tothe company (Ex. 684b, p. 9) and, on the other, representatives of PlantB have indicated that, with few exceptions, operators are basically engagedin monitoring an automated process that is fully enclosed and operatedunder negative pressure (Exs. 532-90. p. 12 and 694-9, Att. 6, p. 20) andwhich therefore should not subject operators to high exposure to lead.If two-thirds of the operators' lead exposure comes from packaging, theresulting geometric mean achieved by implementing recommended controlsin packaging would range from 37 to 51  mg/m\3\, with a midpoint of 44mg/m\3\. If three-quarters of the operators' lead exposure comes from packaging,the resulting geometric mean would range from 30 to 45 mg/m\3\, with amidpoint of 37.5 mg/m\3\. Under both assumptions, the midpoint would bebelow 50 mg/m\3\. OSHA wishes to emphasize that these levels would be achieved by implementingthe recommended engineering controls for the packaging, weighing and palletizingoperation. Further reductions in operators' air lead levels also can beexpected by implementing the additional controls recommended by Meridianto reduce exposures associated with typical operators' tasks like drossing.Improving work practice controls and housekeeping in the area and throughoutthe plant also will reduce exposure levels. Additional reductions in this operation also can be anticipated from conductingthe plant-wide industrial hygiene survey to identify sources of lead emissiontask-by-task and cross winds around the plant and from implementing recommendationsfor methods to control them. With the realization of such multiple reductionsin lead emissions, OSHA is confident that the air lead levels in the packagingoperation (including weighing and palletizing) can be consistently controlledto below 50 mg/m\3\ at Plant B. OSHA has determined that exposure levels in packaging can be controlledconsistently to below 50 andCx.18;ug/m\3\ at Plant A, an older plant thatbags a higher proportion of its product than the industry average. OSHAalso has determined that exposure levels can be controlled consistentlyto below 50 mg/m\3\ at Plant B, a newer plant. A third plant, Plant M,by 1987 had already achieved a geometric mean of 50 mg/m\3\. Consequently,the Agency concludes that packaging can be controlled to below 50 mg/m\3\generally throughout the lead chemicals industry. Maintenance According to industry representatives, the other operation that most contributesto high air lead levels among workers in plants is maintenance. Maintenancework is intermittent, highly varied, and may subject maintenance workersin certain tasks to very high exposure levels, especially when they mustopen up dust-filled or dust-encrusted equipment. Certain maintenance tasksare very difficult to control to 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 582-90, p. 7); othersalready are controlled to below 50 mg/m\3\, as evidenced by the low geometricmean exposures of maintenance employees at Plants A and M (see Tables 1and 2, above). A very high proportion of maintenance work is currently devoted to maintainingmechanized material transfer systems (MMTS), like bucket elevators andscrew conveyors, which have many bearings, joints, and failure points that``require constant maintenance and upkeep,'' according to industry representatives(Ex. 684b, p. 10 and p. 9; and see Exs. 684a. p. 13 and 684c, p. 5). Maintenanceworkers in some plants spend fully 80% of their time repairing and maintainingMMTS (Ex. 684c. p. 5). Maintenance of these systems is reported to constitutethe major exposure problem at Plant C (Ex. 684c, p. 5).MMTS not only are potential sources of high lead exposure for maintenanceworkers. They also are potential sources of fugitive emissions, both whenthey leak and while they are being serviced or repaired (Ex. 684b, p. 10).In fact, mechanical conveyor systems like screw conveyors and bucket elevatorsappear to constitute a major source of workers' exposure throughout theplants (e.g., Ex. 684c, p. 5).This major source of lead exposure for maintenance and other workers islikely to be dramatically reduced in the next few years. The decided trendin the industry is to replace MMTS with pneumatic conveyance systems. Thelatter require much less maintenance and are considerably less likely toleak (Exs. 684a, p. 14; 684c, p. 5). This should also significantly reducebackground levels, especially in plants where they are high.Nevertheless, OSHA recognizes that in certain maintenance tasks exposurelevels may continue to exceed 50 mg/m\3\. If in those operations it isnot feasible to use engineering and work practice controls to reduce airlead levels to the PEL, OSHA recognizes that employers, as they traditionallyhave done, will continue to rely on supplementary respirator use to protectworkers.<T3>Operator. </T3>The only other job classification that might presentsome problems in achieving 50 mg/m\3\ is operator. Operators typicallyengage in two quite different sorts of tasks. First, operators monitorthe lead oxide production process, which is largely automated, enclosedand operated under negative pressure. Second, operators manually performcertain periodic duties that cause them to intervene in that system.Operators, for example, dross the melt pot and take product quality controlsamples at several points during the production process (Ex. 582-90, p.4). In addition, at Plant A and Plant C, operators, like other employees,perform minor maintenance. In some plants like Plant A and Plant B, operatorsalso perform tasks like packaging that are atypical of the job classification.Leaving aside considerations of cross contamination and lead exposure attributableto atypical tasks, the nearly exclusive source of a typical operator'slead exposure is the set of tasks that involve manual intervention in theotherwise largely automated production system. Consequently, any additionalcontrols intended to reduce operators' exposure to lead must be directedat reducing or eliminating these tasks or at more efficiently capturingthe lead emissions associated with them.As indicated earlier, operators at Plant B, in addition to performing typicaloperator tasks, also perform packaging, which constitutes their primarysource of exposure. Controlling operators' exposure levels in packagingto below 50 mg/m\3\ will significantly reduce their exposure levels. Properlycontrolling the melt pot and the tasks of drossing and quality samplingthat operators perform will further reduce these levels. At Plant B, forexample, the drossing task is essentially uncontrolled (Ex. 686E, p. 27).Although company representatives at Plant B concede this (Ex. 694-9, Att.6, p. 28), they did identify improved drossing technology as one of theitems the company was exploring to reduce exposure levels (Ex. 684b, p.10), and they do plan to install drossing chutes to contain emissions duringdrossing. Nevertheless, the company maintains that emissions from drossingcontribute insignificantly to operators' lead exposure, approximately 1.5mg/m\3\ during an eight-hour period (Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, p. 7).OSHA disagrees with this estimate, because it appears to only consideran operator's exposure during the time drossing is being performed anddoes not seem to account, for example, for any lead emissions from thedross after drossing is completed. OSHA believes that with proper controlsexposure levels for operators can be reduced consistently to below 50 mg/m\3\,even in Plant B.At Plant A, where the oxide operators' geometric mean exposure level in1987 already is 62 mg/m\3\ and the geometric mean for the entire 1984-87period is also 62 mg/m\3\, the task of reducing air lead levels to consistentlybelow 50 mg/m\3\, is relatively easy. With improvements in the drossingtask, improvements to the hoods over the melting pots and better work practicesin performing quality control sampling, OSHA has no doubt that exposurelevels there can be reduced to consistently below 50 mg/m\3\. Further reductions,not here accounted for, also can be expected from the implementation ofadditional controls elsewhere in the plant, like controlling cross contamination,that may impact on the exposure of operators to lead.OSHA wishes to make one final, general point about additional controls.OSHA believes that it is feasible to control exposure levels to below 50mg/m\3\ for workers involved in producing lead chemicals other than oxides.Plant M represents a successful approach to controlling exposures in thissegment of the industry (Ex. 688d; see Table 2, above). To the extent thatproblems in controlling air lead levels to 50 mg/m\3\ may continue to existin non-oxide production, OSHA determines that they can be resolved by followingthe recommendations OSHA made in its feasibility assessment of the leadpigments industry. The production processes for lead chemicals other thanlead oxides are sufficiently similar to those used in the production oflead pigments that the controls recommended and the reductions anticipatedfor that industry are broadly applicable here. Conventional technologyis all that is needed.Since industry has not provided any data indicating the infeasibility ofcontrolling exposure levels in non-oxide production to 50 mg/m\3\, OSHAhas not made a separate, detailed analysis of this part of the industry.OSHA concludes, however, that the recommended controls and anticipatedexposure reductions for the lead chemicals and lead pigments industriesin general are broadly applicable to this segment of the industry as well.<T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusions. </T3>Based upon OSHA's independentanalysis of the best available evidence in the record and OSHA's expertiseand experience, the Agency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\by implementing readily available engineering and work practice controlsis technologically feasible for the lead chemicals industry as a whole.Nevertheless, the Agency recognizes that it may not be possible to consistentlyachieve the PEL by these controls for the very limited amount of packagingthat continues to require manual weight adjustment even after state-of-the-art,automated packaging machines have been installed. Since OSHA has foundthe 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL feasible for the industry, employers will be requiredto implement engineering and work practice controls to control exposurelevels to the PEL or the lowest feasible level to protect workers engagedin this sort of packaging, as well. Where all feasible engineering andwork practice controls have been implemented and employees performing thesetasks are still exposed above the PEL as an 8-hour TWA, employers willbe allowed to provide them with respirators for supplemental protectionwhile they are performing such packaging. To sum up, OSHA has shown that in six of the eight plants owned by thethree major producers in the industry, exposure levels already have been,or in the foreseeable future will be controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\most of the time in most of the operations. At Plant A, for example, anolder plant, OSHA has shown that in 1987 a majority of all sampling resultsalready are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and that in six of eight job classificationsgeometric mean exposure levels also are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA hasfurther shown that in the operation that generally is considered by industryto be impossible to control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, packaging, geometric meanexposure levels in 1987 already were controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ inone plant and to 65 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in another. Furthermore, by implementing recommended additional controls, OSHA alsohas shown that air lead levels in packaging and other production processescan be reduced to consistently below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For all operations where the geometric mean exposure level or a majorityof sampling results already is near or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA believesthat a modest improvement in controls, such as improved housekeeping, betterwork practices, better preventive maintenance and perhaps the additionof simple engineering controls (e.g., putting a lid on a dross pot) willassure that exposure levels are consistently controlled to or below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA also believes that, where the geometric mean exposurelevel or a majority of sampling results is above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and ator below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, a relatively limited improvement in controls,like improving the efficiency of a ventilation system, will generally sufficeto bring geometric mean exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Meridian and OSHA have recommended a wide variety of additional controls,to be implemented as appropriate, to achieve the PEL. OSHA wishes to pointout that all of its recommendations for achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ relyexclusively upon conventional and readily available controls. OSHA hasnot needed to exercise its statutory authority to force the developmentof new technology to justify its finding of feasibility in this industry.OSHA also wishes to point out that to the extent it has relied upon theconcept of geometric mean, it has done so because the Agency believes itis the most accurate and convenient way to simply depict the array of monitoringresults. OSHA is assured that it would have reached the same feasibilitydetermination whether geometric means or another statistical methodologyhad been employed. In determining that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable most of the time inmost of the operations in the lead chemicals industry, OSHA does not purportto have recommended an exhaustive list of additional controls. The Agencyis certain that industry will be capable of devising and fine tuning variouscontrols to further reduce exposure levels. In many cases industry alreadyknows much of what it has to do and has begun to modernize its operations.At Plant B, for example, plans exist to modernize the packaging operationsand to reduce exposure levels in drossing by installing drossing chutes.Consequently, OSHA anticipates that industry will be able to consistentlyachieve exposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in nearly every phaseof production. OSHA believes that these levels will be attained by implementing an integratedsystem of controls. The basic element in that system is an industrial hygienestudy. Each plant should have an experienced industrial hygienist performan in-depth task analysis and plant-wide survey. This analysis and surveyshould identify sources of emission in each task and sources of cross draftsand cross contamination. Such an analysis should also recommend appropriateengineering and work practice controls to reduce emissions and minimizeemployee exposures. If, after implementing these recommendations, reductionsin air lead levels deviate substantially from what was anticipated, a followupindustrial hygiene evaluation should be conducted and necessary correctionsmade. The second element in that system is the development of good written housekeepingand work practice programs that are systematically implemented so thatproper procedures are routinely and meticulously followed. For example,wall-to-wall cleanings should be conducted at least annually. The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean and efficientcondition. Based on the site visits and other information in the record, OSHA doesnot believe that any company in the industry at present has thoroughlyimplemented an integrated system of controls. While control programs atvarious plants in the industry have certain strengths, key elements ofan integrated system are missing, even at a plant like Plant B, which claimsto be state of the art. The lead chemicals industry does not agree that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is technologically feasible. Industry's disagreement is based upon sevenmain points. First and most generally. industry claims the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL cannot be achieved ``on a consistent basis'' in any operation in thelead chemicals industry (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 2-4). Second, industry arguesthat even 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved ``on a consistent basis''in maintenance operations and 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved ``ona consistent basis'' in packaging (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 2-4). Third, industryasserts the efforts of Meridian and the expert panel are based upon mistakendeterminations of facts, and are unsubstantiated, biased, and methodologicallydefective (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 1, pp. 2-3, 5-6; Att. 5, pp. 3, 6-7; andAtt. 6, pp. 11, 23). Fourth, industry alleges there is insufficient informationin the record to support a finding of feasibility (Exs. 582-90. pp. 20-21;694-9, Att. 6, p. 2). Fifth, industry asserts that for a PEL to be feasibleit must effectively be achievable all the time in all operations (e.g..Ex. 694-9. Att. 5, p. 6, Att. 6, p. 32; Tr. 1276, 1278). Sixth, industryargues that use of the geometric mean is inappropriate in assessing feasibilityboth because compliance is judged on the basis of single-day's sampling(not on a mean of various days' TWAs) and because the geometric mean isdownwardly biased. Seventh, industry argues that the Meridian addendumviolates a confidentiality agreement between LIA and OSHA and thereforeshould be removed from the record. First, industry asserts that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved in anyoperation on a consistent basis. This assertion is the centerpiece of signed,sworn affidavits submitted by LIA from William J. Duffin, identified asthe Environmental Manager of Anzon (Ex. 694-9, Att. 2); Benjamin FranklinMcKinney, identified as the president of Oxide and Chemical Corportation(Ex. 694-9, Att. 3; and William P. Wilke, IV, identified as vice presidentof Hammond Lead Products, Inc (Ex. 694-9. Att. 4). Based upon the evidencein the record, OSHA does not find affiants' assertion persuasive.OSHA has analyzed record data and information from the very plants uponwhich affiants base their claim of infeasibility and has concluded thePEL can be achieved by engineering and work practice controls. Affiants'position also is contradicted by an earlier statement by the presidentof one of affiants' companies, who said that, with the exception of maintenanceand non-bulk packaging (of which his company does almost none), his companyalready is achieving 50 mg/m\3\ at its other plants and that he expectedto do so at the visited location, as well, after moving into a new facility(Ex. 684c, p. 5). Affiants' position also is not consistent with recordevidence and other statements made elsewhere in this remand rulemakingby affiants and their companies. For example, although the affiant  from Anzon  asserts  that  50    mg/m\3\ is not achievable in any operationin his plant, exposure data from his plant shows that in 1987, for example,before any further improvements are made to work practice and engineeringcontrols, a majority of monitoring results already are below 50 mg/m\3\.OSHA's analysis of these data further shows that in 1987 geometric meansin all operations but two also are below 50 mg/m\3\. (OSHA omits supportingcitations. See related discussion of confidentiality, below.) As OSHA has previously shown, not only is the PEL of 50 mg/m\3\ achievable,it already is being achieved most of the time in operations at plants ownedby affiants' companies. At one of those plants, for example, 20 of 31 samplingresults for maintenance workers in 1987 are below 50 mg/m\3\, and theirgeometric mean is 22 mg/m\3\. (OSHA omits supporting citations. See relateddiscussion of confidentiality, below.) More importantly, since the consideration of feasibility is not limitedto a consideration of what an industry has already achieved, OSHA has shownthat in every operation substantial, further reductions in air lead levelscan be achieved by the implementation of recommended additional controls.Indeed, with a system of integrated and improved controls, OSHA has shownthat 50 mg/m\3\ can be achieved in all operations, with the possible exceptionof certain maintenance tasks. In addition, the construction of new plants and the modernization of existingplants have major positive implications for reduced exposure levels, asMeridian has pointed out (Ex. 686E, pp. 6, 11, and 26). LIA seems to recognizethese implications. Indeed, in its argument that 50 mg/m\3\ is generallyinfeasible for the lead chemicals industry, LIA distinguishes between largerand older plants, on the one hand, and more modern plants. For the largerand older plants, LIA asserts that 50 mg/m\3\ is ``not feasible for virtuallyall production processes * * *.'' However, for ``the most modern plants''LIA says only that ``the 50 mg/m\3\ PEL cannot be technologically achievedin certain processes * * *.'' The only two operations LIA names as examplesare maintenance and packing (Ex. 582-90, p. 25). This would seem to meanthat at least in the most modern plants LIA recognizes that the 50 mg/m\3\PEL is achievable in all but these ``certain'' operations. In new and modernized plants, the replacement of mechanical material conveyorsystems by pneumatic systems will substantially reduce exposure levelsfor maintenance personnel and background levels in plants. Packaging willbe more automated and more products will be shipped in bulk. With so manyof the major producers modernizing, bringing new plants on line, or planningor constructing new plants, the issue of high employee exposure in certainof the older plants increasingly is becoming moot. Several of the olderfacilities are likely to be closed by the time the standard is appliedto the lead chemicals industry. Industry criticisms of this main pointare not persuasive (Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, pp. 5-9, 28). Broad assertions by industry representatives that 50 mg/m\3\ is not achievableneed to be carefully scrutinized. Based upon OSHA's three site visits tolead chemical plants in 1988, for example, OSHA is certain that none ofthe plants examined is close to the limits of technological feasibility.Only one of those plants, Plant B, even claims to be state of the art foroxide production (Ex. 684b, p. 11). If ``state of the art'' means the highestlevel of available technology, and especially if it implies that no substantialtechnological improvements can be made with available, conventional technology,as OSHA believes it does, Plant B is far from state of the art. In the two operations likely to be the main sources of lead emission inPlant B and industry wide, for example, packaging and maintenance, thereis considerable room for improvement using available technology. More sophisticatedpackaging machines could be purchased and installed that would substantiallyreduce or perhaps eliminate several manual tasks that are important sourcesof packers' lead exposure. Plant B itself would seem to agree with thispoint, since it currently has plans to modernize its packaging operation(Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, p. 32). Where practical, mechanical material conveyorsystems, like bucket elevators, also could be replaced by relatively cleanerpneumatic systems. Moreover, since Plant B has never had a certified industrial hygienistperform a plant-wide job/task analysis to identify all sources of leadexposure and their relative contributions to workers' exposure levels,OSHA does not think the company has sufficient information to reach definitiveconclusions concerning the limits of feasibility even in its own plant,let alone across the industry. By contrast, companies like the one thatowns Plant C, which report they already have achieved 50 mg/m\3\ in mostoperations in most plants, have definitive experience that the 50 mg/m\3\PEL is achievable. In responding to this first industry argument, OSHA has tried to maintainthe name confidentiality of site-visited plants, in accordance with OSHA'slimited confidentiality agreement with LIA (Ex. 685A). This has been madevery difficult by the fact that officials from the visited plants latein the rulemaking submitted affidavits in which they identify themselvesand their company by name and indicate that their company has been recentlyvisited by OSHA in connection with this rulemaking. OSHA believes thatby submitting such affidavits these companies effectively waived any rightthey may have had to name confidentiality. Nonetheless, the Agency in respondingto affiants' assertions has continued to maintain name confidentiality.To the extent the companies may believe that name confidentiality has beencompromised, OSHA maintains this is attributable solely to the companiesand their submission of such affidavits, which required a response fromOSHA.Industry's second main argument is that even 200 mg/m\3\ cannot be achievedon a consistent basis in maintenance operations and even 100 mg/m\3\ cannotbe achieved on a consistent basis in packaging (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 2-4).OSHA disagrees with industry's contention.With regard to packaging, the assertion that 100 mg/m\3\ cannot be achievedin packaging is directly contradicted by Plant A's statement that 100 mg/m\3\can be achieved in that operation (Ex. 694-9, Att. 5, p. 8). It also isin conflict with Plant A's exposure data, which in 1987 show that nearly60% of all monitoring results that the plant considered typical for PBDoperators already are below 100 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686c). Similarly, at PlantM, 75% of all monitoring results in packaging in 1987 were below 100 mg/m\3\(Ex. 686d). Moreover, since packaging operations across the industry generallydo not incorporate state-of-the-art technology, current exposure levelsin packaging can be substantially reduced by implementing additional controls,as OSHA has demonstrated above.With regard to maintenance, exposure data show that levels well below 200mg/m\3\ already are being achieved with considerable consistency. At PlantA, for example, in the years 1984-87 typically over 60% of monitoring results,adjusted in accordance with Plant A's annotations, were below 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 688c). In those years, approximately three-quarters of adjusted monitoringresults also typically were below 100 mg/m\3\. In fact, only 4 of 111 monitoringresults were over 200 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 688c).Nevertheless, as OSHA stated above, the Agency recognizes that in somemaintenance operations exposure levels may continue to exceed 50 mg/m\3\.If in a limited number of these maintenance operations it is not feasibleto use engineering and work practice controls to reduce air lead levels,OSHA also recognizes that employers will have to continue to rely on supplementaryuse of respirators to protect workers, as they traditionally have done.This sort of maintenance operation is not really relevant to an assessmentof technological feasibility since OSHA has consistently recognized thatin certain limited maintenance operations sole reliance on engineeringcontrols may be infeasible.In any event, to establish technological feasibility the Agency need notprove the PEL is capable of being achieved all of the time or in all operations.Thus, for example, even if it were true that the PEL were not achievablein a single operation in many plants, that would not in itself mean thePEL was technologically infeasible for the industry.Third, industry argues that the efforts of Meridian and the expert panelare based upon mistaken determinations of facts, and are unsubstantiated,biased, and methodologically defective (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 1, pp. 2-3,5-6, Att. 5, pp. 3, 6-7, Att. 6, pp. 11, 23). On the whole, OSHA rejectsthese criticisms and believes that Meridian did a creditable job withinthe given time and resource constraints.Meridian has had extensive experience and possesses very broad competencein the area of industrial hygiene, the principles of which are generallyapplicable across industries. It also has expertise and broad experiencein assessing factors relevant to technological feasibility. Physically,there is nothing unique about lead dust and lead fume or about the leadchemical industry that would make Meridian's extensive expertise and competencein evaluating engineering and work practice controls across many industriesirrelevant to this industry. The control technologies recommended are conventionaland transferrable from similar industries, and the anticipated effectivenessof these controls in reducing lead levels also is the same across industries(e.g., Ex. 582-90, p. 9). The expert panel established by Meridian alsowas composed of independent, broadly experienced, certified industrialhygienists, not themselves employees of Meridian.Meridian s final report (Ex. 686E) and its conclusions are based on numeroussources in the record. These include data, other evidence and commentssubmitted by lead chemical companies, trade associations and other interestedparties; site visits to three lead chemical plants, participated in bythree experienced, certified industrial hygienists; and recommendationsby the expert panel, two of whose members had been on one or more of thesite visits.Of course, notwithstanding their experience and expertise, Meridian andthe expert panel may have made certain mistakes of fact and drawn someincorrect conclusions. This is almost inevitable when a contractor andexperts can devote only limited time and resources to examining a complexindustry and voluminous record. Nevertheless, some of the specific allegationsthat Meridian misstated facts themselves seem incorrect. For example, PlantA states (Ex. 694-9, Att. 5, p.. 7) that Meridian was mistaken in its April1988 final report when it said that no industrial hygiene audit or taskanalysis had been performed at Plant A (Ex. 686 E, p. 29). As Plant A haspointed out, its plant was audited by an industrial hygienist in October1987, just prior to the public hearing in this rulemaking, and task samplingin one department had been completed by March 1988. However, Plant A didnot report these facts on the record until its comments in late May 1988,after Meridian's April report had been submitted to the record. Moreover,task sampling had not yet been completed by the May 1988 comments (Ex.694-9, Att. 5, pp. 7-8). Meridian's point, thus, appears to accuratelyreflect the evidence in the record at the time.Similarly, Plant B criticizes Meridian s methodology for including PlantA's packer/blender/dryer operator (PBD) in its analysis of exposure datafor operators. Plant B argues that this violates the job classificationsand job descriptions submitted by LIA, wherein ``the operator category* * * excludes packing'' (Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, p. 11; and see Ex. 582-90,p. 4). OSHA believes Plant B has a point and in deference to that pointdoes not in its own assessment treat PBDs as operators, despite the factthat PBDs' other tasks are typical operators' tasks (wet process). Nonetheless,the fundamental problem lies not in Meridian's methodology but in the fitbetween LIA job classifications and actual job classifications in the industry.LIA sets up five general job classifications: operator, packer, leadman,maintenance and shipper. However, several of these classifications do notexist at a number of plants (e.g., there are no leadmen at Plant A or PlantX). Moreover, some plants have classifications not included in the five(e.g., Plant A has general laborers).More importantly, in two of the three plants OSHA visited in 1988, thereis no distinct job category for packer. At Plant B, no job title includesthe word ``packer'' (Ex. 684b). Packing there apparently is done by operatorsand shippers. By contrast, at Plant A one job title is PBD, which includes,but is not limited to packaging. If data from PBD monitoring results cannot properly be analyzed as partof the exposure data for operators, as Plant B asserts, must it also beexcluded from analysis of the data for packers, who typically do not performtasks of drying and blending? OSHA does not think so. If it were excluded,the Plant A data would simply have to be discarded, since it fits no otherjob classification. Moreover, if OSHA could only rely on data collectedfrom employees who exclusively do packing, the Agency would be left withno reliable data for packagers from the plants where it conducted sitevisits. OSHA therefore believes that Meridian's approach is a reasonableeffort to make sense of data from various sources that do not all neatlyfit into the typical job categories presented in good faith by industry.Industry also claims that the expert panel's estimated reductions in exposurelevels are meaningless, because they are unsubstantiated by engineeringanalysis. (Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, pp. 23-24, 30 and 31). OSHA disagrees. Theanticipated reductions are meaningful because they are supported by thecollective expert judgment of the three experienced, certified industrialhygienists who constitute the panel. OSHA is not required to support eachof its estimates with substantial engineering analysis. Given OSHA's limitedresources, to deny the value of expert judgment and to demand instead thatOSHA conduct a ``substantial engineering analysis'' for each operationin an industry to prove technological feasibility would often precludethe Agency from being able to prove technological feasibility. Furthermore, Plant B's alternative suggestion that a more meaningful estimateof the real reductions achievable in packaging could have been made ifthe expert panel had studied the best packaging operations and comparedthem with packaging operations in older facilities (Ex. 694-9, Att. 6,p. 24), is not acceptable. Plant B's suggestion would only be useful inassessing technological feasibility if the best packaging operations inthe industry truly incorporated state-of-the-art technology. However, theevidence in the record does not show that any plant in the industry hasa state-of-the-art packaging operation, and OSHA does not believe suchan operation currently exists. Consequently, Plant B's suggestion cannotprovide an estimate of the full extent of achievable reductions in exposurelevels but instead would merely provide an estimate of reductions basedon levels already achieved at one plant or another. However, OSHA's determinationof what is technologically feasible is not confined to what has alreadybeen achieved. Thus, OSHA concludes that Meridian's findings and conclusions generallyare firmly grounded in the record and that its methodology generally representsa reasonable effort to make sense of, and use that record. In any event,OSHA has independently assessed the record, reviewed Meridian's final reportfor accuracy, taken account of industry's comments on that report, andrelied only in part upon the Meridian report for the Agency's determinationof technological feasibility.Industry's fourth argument is that there is insufficient information inthe record to support a finding of feasibility for the industry (Exs. 582-90,pp. 20-21; 694-9, Att. 6, p. 2). As indicated by the entire preceedingdiscussion of the record evidence in this document, OSHA disagrees. Thereis in the record substantial exposure data and information, including threesite visit reports, concerning six of the eight plants owned by the threefirms that together represent 80% of the industry's domestic productioncapacity. There is, as well, a final contractor's report that includesfindings of facts, analyses, and specific estimates by an expert panelof anticipated reductions in exposure levels to be achieved operation-by-operationin three plants by employers' implementing recommended additional controls.OSHA believes the record evidence constitutes a firm basis for assessingtechnological feasibility and that the evidence supports the Agency's determinationthat the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable by engineering and workpractice controls. Industry's fifth argument is that for a PEL to be considered feasible itmust effectively be achievable all the time in all operations (e.g., Ex,694-9, Att. 5, p. 6, Att. 6, p. 32; Tr. 1276, 1278). Industry essentiallyargues that since it can be cited by OSHA for an employee's eight-hourTWA being in excess of the PEL in any operation on any single day, thereforeOSHA must show an industry can achieve the PEL all of the time in all operationsto prove technological feasibility. This characterization of the issue of technological feasibility is nowhereclearer than in Plant B's closing comments in the record. There (Ex. 694-9,Att. 6, p. 32). Plant B asserts that Meridian's statement that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\``can be achieved most of the time'' in relatively new plants really meansthat 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is <T3>not </T3>feasible. Plant B explains that in enforcement ``OSHA usessingle samples to demonstrate compliance with the lead standard.'' Consequently,``<T3>meeting the standard most of the time does not demonstrate feasibility.</T3>Industry must meet the standard every time'' (emphasis added). This perspective is inherent, as well, in LIA's final comments (Ex. 694-9,Att. 1, p. 2). There, LIA criticizes Meridian's statement that employerscan have reasonable confidence that their workers' exposure levels willnot exceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ ``most of the time'' as inadequate assurance.That assurance, LIA goes on to say, ``does not mean that the * * * industrycan achieve such exposure levels for all tasks on a continuous basis ** *. [I]ndustry is not provided [by OSHA] with the opportunity to complywith a promulgated health standard `most of the time'.'' Industry's assertions elsewhere that it is not feasible to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\``on a consistent basis'' (Exs. 694-9, Att. 2-4, Att. 6, pp. 19, 20) mustbe understood in terms of its perspective on technological feasibility.To industry, the ambiguous phrase ``on a consistent basis'' appears tomean all of the time, not most of the time. The former meaning alone isconsonant with industry's position that, for a PEL to be considered technologicallyfeasible, industry must be able to comply with it essentially 100% of thetime. If OSHA is correct in this understanding, then when affiants assert that``it is not feasible to achieve on a consistent basis a 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\permissible exposure imit for the remaining processing areas under normalconditions'' (Ex. 694-9, Att. 2-4), they mean it is not feasible to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ <T3>all of the time </T3>in those operations under those conditions. Thusunderstood, OSHA can agree with industry's point without agreeing thatthat amounts to a proof of infeasibility. In fact, OSHA believes that industry is confusing technological feasibilitywith compliance. The two are related but not the same. As the courts havesaid, to prove the technological feasibility of a PEL, OSHA is not requiredto prove that an industry can achieve the PEL in all of the operationsall the time. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1270. Indeed, if a PEL is generally feasibleacross an industry, there may be an operation in which the PEL can neverbe achieved and in which industry's obligation is to engineer down to thelowest feasible level. Achieving that level, then, would constitute fullcompliance with paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard. OSHA believes thatindustry's extreme interpretation of technological feasibility to meanachievable all of the time in all operations would effectively subvertOSHA's statutory mission to protect workers ``to the extent feasible.''Industry's sixth argument is that use of the geometric mean is inappropriatein assessing feasibility both because compliance is judged on the basisof single-day's sampling not on a mean of various days' TWAs and becausethe geometric mean is downwardly biased (Ex. 694-9, Att. 5, p. 6, Att.6, pp. 15, 21). The first part of this argument is essentially the sameas industry's fifth argument and is unpersuasive for the reasons set outabove and for the reasons stated in the introduction to technological feasibilityin this preamble. The claim that the geometric mean is downwardly biasedis based upon the fact that the geometric mean is generally lower thanthe arithmetic mean and the related fact that the geometric mean givesless weight to outlying monitoring results, especially, for all practicalpurposes, to high outlying results. In response, OSHA notes that the geometric mean is widely accepted by thescientific community as the best single statistic to accurately representan array of data that, like typical exposure monitoring results, is lognormally distributed (Ex. 686E, pp. 16-17). The scientific validity ofusing the geometric mean to analyse exposure data is recognized by industryitself (e.g., Ex. 694-9, Att. 6, pp. 15, 21). The geometric mean is consideredthe best way to represent exposure data in part because it does give lessweight to outliers. In giving less weight to outliers, the highest of whichwould otherwise tend to have a disproportionate effect on the mean, thegeometric mean becomes lower than the arithmetic mean. Hence, the geometricmean is lower than the arithmetic mean for scientific reasons. OSHA's choiceof the geometric mean as a tool of analysis is based upon its analyticpower and empirical justification. Industry's seventh argument is that the Meridian addendum violates theconfidentiality agreements between LIA and OSHA and therefore should beremoved from the record (Ex. 694-9, Att. 1, p. 5) LIA argues that the confidentialityagreement ``clearly'' states that ``<T3>the plant visits </T3>were not designed to address the issue of economicand technical feasibility of the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL * * *.'' (emphasisadded). Rather, LIA contends, ``<T3>the plant visits </T3>were designed specifically to gather informationwith respect to production processes and the application of engineeringcontrols'' (emphasis added). In responding to LIA's argument, OSHA first notes that nothing LIA assertsis grounded in the language of the confidentiality agreement. On the contrary,the language of the confidentiality agreement provides no basis for distinguishingbetween addressing feasibility and gathering information with respect toproduction processes and the application of engineering controls. In anyevent, the Agency finds the meaning of LIA's point unclear and is not persuadedthat a meaningful distinction exists. Even if the distinction were validand relevant, OSHA would still reject the argument that the Agency breachedthe confidentiality agreement. The issue is whether the confidentiality agreement prohibits OSHA fromusing any information gathered on the site visits in the Agency's finalassessment of feasibility. The only provision of the confidentiality agreementdealing with feasibility conclusions is paragraph 5 (Ex. 685A). That paragraphis narrowly drawn. It says nothing about <T3>plant visits </T3>as such, but focuses exclusively on <T3>plant visit reports. </T3>The paragraph simply provides: ``The plantvisit <T3>reports </T3>will be factual in nature and will not draw any conclusionsas to either the technological or economic feasibility of achieving thePEL'' (emphasis added). The agreement thus prohibits OSHA from drawingtechnological or economic feasibility conclusions in the plant visit <T3>reports. </T3>In fact, OSHA did not draw feasibility conclusions inthose reports. LIA does not claim it did.The agreement does not prohibit, and cannot be read to prohibit all subsequentuse of information or data gathered on the plant visits in assessing feasibility.OSHA would not have conducted site visits under such restrictive conditions,which would have rendered the visits essentially useless. These visitswere made late in the rulemaking. They were not visits made prior to aproposal for purposes of introducing OSHA staffers for the first time toconditions in the relevant industry. By December 1987 and January 1988,OSHA had no need to conduct introductory visits. The Agency repeatedlymade these points, both orally and in writing, to LIA and other industryrepresentatives in the negotiations leading up to the site visits. A letterof December 4, 1987 to Robert N. Steinwurtzel, Counsel for LIA, from RichardM. Pfeffer, Project Attorney for OSHA in this rulemaking (Ex. 700), forexample, concludes as follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">Finally, let me reiterate that the Agency to date has not made a determinationabout the feasibility of implementing Section 1910.1025(e)(1) of the OSHAlead standard in the remand industries. The Agency believes the plant visitswill be useful in reaching a determination * * * OSHA's general approachto making the visits, as stated by Charles Adkins [, Director of the Officeof Health Standards Programs,] at the November 23 meeting, is that if wecannot use what we see, there is no point in carrying out the visits. OSHAwishes to make the best informed decision possible. </ITAG>Actions by company representatives and counsel for LIA during the sitevisits confirm that industry anticipated that the information gatheredon the plant visits would be considered as part of OSHA's final assessmentof feasibility. For example, during the visits company officials discussed,and made specific statements regarding the feasibility of achieving the50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL in their plants. These statements are incorporatedin the site visit reports (e.g., Ex. 684b, p. 11). Yet, so far as the Agencyis aware, neither LIA nor the companies visited objected that their inclusionviolated the confidentiality agreement. If LIA and the companies believedthe site visits were not designed to ``address the issue of * * * feasibility''at all, the Agency believes they would not have made such statements duringthe visits and, in any event, after the visits would have objected to theirinclusion in the site visit reports. Thus, the Agency is assured that the confidentiality agreement does notbar data and information gathered during the site visits from being usedby OSHA in its assessment of feasibility. The Agency is further assuredfrom the companies' and LIA's own actions that this was in fact, or inany event should have been understood by them. Thus, there is no justificationfor removing any document from the record on the basis of LIA's allegationof breach of confidentiality. Indeed, since the agreement does not barOSHA from using such information, OSHA may well be under a statutory obligationto use the information where it constitutes the ``best available evidence.''Consequently, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry's arguments. Based upon itsown experience, expertise and the record evidence, OSHA concludes thata PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically achievable by means of engineeringand work practice controls in the lead chemicals industry. <T3>Uses. </T3>Lead chemicals principally include lead oxides, lead silicates,and lead soaps. Uses include incorporation into products such as ceramics,paints, glass, plastics (mostly as stabilizers), and automotive batteries.They are also used in glazes for china and pottery. <T3>Industry Profile. </T3>The Lead Chemicals Industry is part of SIC classification2819. Industrial Inorganic Chemicals, and includes the production of leadoxides, lead silicates, and lead soaps, among other compounds. There are 13 firms currently involved in the production of lead oxide and/orred lead (primary lead chemicals), 19 producers of lead chemicals otherthan lead oxides, and an additional 2 or 3 plants involved in the productionof lead stabilizers [Ex. 686e, p. 2-4]. The Lead Industries Association(LIA) reports, however, that approximately 85 percent of the domestic productioncapacity of this industry is accounted for by just five producers [Ex.582-90, p. 1], and all are primary lead chemical producers. Also, withregard to the 19 lead chemical producers mentioned above, ``the amountsof lead involved are quite small in relation to the amounts involved inprimary lead chemical production'' [Ex. 686e, p. 4]. OSHA has thereforefocused its analysis on primary lead chemicals. Employment for the lead chemicals sector was estimated in 1982 at 700 totalworkers [Ex. 575, p. 2]. Information provided by the LIA indicates thatthere are currently 74 operators, 24 leadmen, 36 maintenance workers, 59packers, and 10 shipping employees, or 203 total lead-exposed workers employedby the 5 LIA member firms [Ex. 582-90, p. 4].Production data show that lead oxide production fluctuated during the period1980 to 1985, with red lead shipments at a five year low in 1984 (12,815short tons) and shipments of litharge at a six year high in 1985 (94,080short tons). Combined shipments of these chemicals declined 28 percentin 1986, then increased over 13 percent in 1987 [1987 Minerals Yearbook,Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of Interior]. In assessing price trends for lead oxide products, OSHA found the conceptof unit value to be the accepted measure of value by both the industryand government agencies which collect and report data on lead chemicals.Unit value is derived as total value of product divided by total volume,expressed in cents per pound. For example, in 1987, the 80,568 metric tons(177,571,872 lbs.) of litharge and red lead shipped by U.S. producers hada total value of $72,292,620. (Litharge is estimated to constitute approximately80 percent of the value of this combined product category and red leadis estimated to constitute the remaining 20 percent. OSHA believes, therefore,that the unit value for the combined product category is an appropriateproxy for the unit value of litharge [Ex. 575, p. 7]). Unit value for thisproduct category was thus 40.7andCx.11; per pound. This value must not beconfused with quoted price, which is generally higher, as transactionsgenerally do not take place at quoted price. The LIA reported an average price for litharge in 1987 of 39andCx.11; perpound [Ex 582-90, Appendix D, Table 3]. This value is consistent with theunit value derived above; OSHA concludes, then, that the LIA prices submittedare unit values and not price quotations. This value represents a 50 percentincrease from the 1986 unit value of 26andCx.11; per pound, according toLIA data. Unit values of battery oxide were also provided by the LIA. Unitvalues for this product increased from about 23andCx.11; per pound in 1986to about 36andCx.11; per pound in 1987, a jump of approximately 56 percent[Ex. 582-90]. With regard to imports, the U.S. imported 24.8 million pounds of lithargein 1986. The unit value of these imports was 19andCx.11; per pound [Ex. 582-90,Appendix D, Table 7]. In 1987, unit value of imported litharge rose to33andCx.11; per pound, an increase of 65 percent over the previous year'svalue. (In order to reduce tariffs, the value of imported shipments maybe underreported.) Quantity increased over 26 percent during the same period[1987 Minerals Yearbook, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of Interior].Imports of lead compounds other than oxides increased twofold from 1980to 1985 [Ex. 575, p. 14]. Data on imports of some of the products which incorporate lead chemicalsshow that 27 million pounds of pigments and 9.2 million lead-acid storagebatteries were imported in 1986. That same year, 2.3 million color televisiontubes and over 5 million pounds of paints were also imported. [Ex. 582-90,Appendix D, Tables 8-9D]. Demand for red lead is related to its use as a paint additive, its usein ceramics, and its use in storage batteries. Litharge is shipped foruse in ceramics, chrome pigments, paints, rubber, and other uses. Demandfor both of these chemicals in paints has decreased since the early 1980s;this use represents, however, only about 20-25 percent of red lead shipmentsand typically less than 10 percent of total litharge shipments [Ex. 575,pp. 10-11]. Demand for lead silicates is tied to the demand for potteryand china glazes while the demand for lead stabilizers is related to theiruse in plastics [Ex. 575, p. 12]. One industry source reports that ``leaddemand is stagnant, if not declining'' [Ex. 582-90, p. 19]. Another claimedthat the ``glass and plastics markets for lead chemicals are growing quitequickly; the battery oxide market is growing slowly; and the pigments marketis declining'' [Ex. 686e, p. 6]. The shipments and unit value data presentedabove indicate strong demand for both litharge and battery oxide. Comparable substitutes for the lead chemicals in glass, ceramics, crystal,and stabilizers do not exist. There are, however, substitutes for the leadchemicals in paints [Ex. 575, pp. 13-14]. Financial data averaged for four of the five lead chemical producers representedby the LIA showed negative return on investment and return on net worthratios for the years 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 and positive rates for1984 [Ex. 582-90, Appendix D, Tables 1 and 2]. Primary lead price data (primary lead is the major input for lead chemicals)provided in the LIA submittal were consistent with the Bureau of Mines``U.S. Producer'' and ``North American Primary Producer Mean'' (NAPPM)price quotations for lead [1987 Minerals Yearbook, Bureau of Mines, U.S.Department of Interior]. However, according to the Bureau, the quoted priceis not the actual transaction price (actual price paid) of the metal. Thetransaction price more closely resembles the quoted price less a discount,and approximates the London Metal Exchange (LME) value, which averaged18.4andCx.11; in 1986, plus a 4andCx.11; or 5andCx.11; per pound transportationcost. Since the U.S. quoted price averaged about 22andCx.11; in 1986, discountswere probably small or nonexistent that year (the quoted price and thetransaction price were about the same). In 1985, discounts were also smallor nonexistent. In other years, however, quoted prices have diverged from transaction prices.For example, since the price of lead on the LME averaged 27andCx.11; for1987, the transaction price would have approximated 32andCx.11; (27andCx.11;plus 5andCx.11; transportation cost), resulting in a discount of about 4andCx.11;per pound for the year between the actual price paid for the metal andthe quoted producer prices, which averaged 36andCx.11;. In 1984, the lastyear for which the LIA firms were reported to be profitable, this discountwas about 1andCx.11;-2andCx.11;. The LIA reported that U.S. lead chemicals producers ``have not succeededin increasing the conversion charge to the point where such charges covertotal costs'' [Ex. 582-90, Appendix D, p. 3]. (Conversion charge is definedby the LIA to be the difference between the price of primary lead and theprice of the industry's product). The LIA submission compared the differencebetween litharge unit values and quoted primary lead prices and concludedthat the conversion charge had been ``modest relative to total productprice, and confined within a narrow range over [the years 1984 to 1987]''[Ex 582-90, Appendix D, p. 3]. OSHA believes, however, that transactionprices rather than quoted prices of primary lead should be used in computingconversion charges. If transaction prices are used, based on the abovediscussion, conversion charges for the profitable year of 1984 (a yearin which conversion charges exceeded total costs_see LIA quote above) wouldhave exceeded conversion charges in 1985 and 1986, both reported to beunprofitable years, by as much as 2andCx.11; per pound. This figure representsapproximately 40 percent of the conversion charges reported for 1985 and1986. Since the difference between litharge unit values and primary leadtransaction prices appeared greatest in 1987, and since no evidence inthe record suggests a corresponding increase in production costs between1984 and 1987, OSHA concludes that profitability in 1987 was greater than1984. Additionally, OSHA notes that unit values for domestic products increasedby as much as 56 percent in 1987 (see above). At the same time, the primarylead transaction price (i.e., input price) increased only about 45 percent.OSHA also notes that the unit value of imported litharge (adjusted up by5andCx.11; per pound) increased by about 58 percent. This information suggestsan improvement in price the competitiveness of domestic producers in 1987.Finally, the recent construction of two new plants in this sector [Ex.694-9, Company B comments, p. 34] suggests that at least two firms arenow profitable and/or expect to be profitable in the long run. For these reasons, OSHA does not believe that the LIA profitability ratiosfor 1983 through 1986 accurately reflect the current financial conditionof lead chemical producers. Instead the Dun and Bradstreet 1986 rate ofreturn on sales for SIC 2816 of 4.9 percent was used to estimate the economicimpact of the rule [Dun and Bradstreet Industry Norms, 1987].<T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>Costs to be incurred by the lead chemicalsindustry in order to achieve compliance with the 50 microgram per cubicmeter standard are for additional ventilation, the implementation of improvedpackaging technology, and improved housekeeping. These costs will vary,however, depending on the age of the facility. Also, costs were estimatedonly for LIA member facilities which represent approximately 85 percentof primary lead chemicals production. The ``users'' of lead chemicals appearto manufacture lead chemicals as a minor part of their product lines, andthere is no evidence in the record to suggest that workers employed inthese operations are being exposed above the PEL of 50 micrograms per cubicmeter [Ex. 686e,  p. 2]. Among LIA member companies, two older plants will require additional ventilationin the melting and semi-automatic packaging areas (semi-automatic packagingrefers to packaging in bags or drums with manual intervention). Costs wereestimated based on the following judgements: ventilation costs will beincurred at the rate of $15 per cfm of air handling capacity for both areas,and this cost includes ductwork, additional baghouse capacity, fans, providingfor makeup air, and installation; the required cfm capacity for ventilationin the melting area (melt pots, molten lead transfer system, and drossingoperations) is estimated to be 4,500 and; the required cfm capacity forventilation for semi-automatic packaging stations is estimated to be 4,000.It is estimated that there are two of each type of area per facility andeach will require the appropriate system. Automated packaging units arealso expected to be implemented. Since customer demand for various packagesizes limits the use of automatic packaging units, it is assumed that onlytwo such units will be implemented per facility. The capital costs of eachunit are estimated to be $150,000, including bagger, palletizer, and associatedventilation [Ex. 582-17. p. 6]. Total incremental capital costs for melting area ventilation for the olderplant category amount to $135,000 ($67,500 for each of two melt pots) andincremental capital costs for packaging amount to $420,000 (ventilationfor two semi-automatic stations at $60,000 per ventilation system and twoautomated packagers at $150,000 per unit). Since many semi-automatic packagingstations already have some local ventilation in place, costs could be somewhatless than the $60,000 estimated in many cases. Annualized capital charges,based on a useful equipment life of 12 years and financing charges of 10%,will be $81,474. Operation and maintenance expenses are estimated to be10% of capital costs and are therefore expected to be $55,500. Thus, totalannual costs for this equipment are $136,974. Costs attributable to improved housekeeping will also be incurred. Installationof a central vacuum system is estimated to cost $50,000 [Ex. 694-9, CompanyA response, p. 7]. Total annual costs, including annualized capital andOandamp;M expenses, would be $12,340. Evidence in the record indicates thatat least one of the two older facilities has already installed a centralvacuum system [Ex. 694-9 Company A response, p. 6], and OSHA estimatesthat a 50 percent current compliance level estimate is reasonable. Totalaverage incremental annual costs per plant for this equipment are thus$6,170. The cost of an annual cleaning is estimated to be $50,000 per year($5,000 per day over ten days) [Ex. 694-9, Company A response. p. 7]. Finally,incremental costs for routine housekeeping will be incurred. OSHA estimatesthis cost to be $7,350 annually, based on an assumption of one and one-halfperson-hours of work per day, seven days per week, over 50 weeks at anaverage wage of approximately $14 per hour. Total incremental annual costsfor housekeeping are $63,520. In sum, total incremental annual costs for older facilities are estimatedto be about $200,000. Three relatively new plants will require similar controls in the packagingarea but less extensive controls in the melting area, as only ventilationfor the drossing operation is believed to be necessary for these plants.The judgments used to develop the costs for relatively new plants werethe same as those used for older plants, except that the air handling capacityrequirement for the melting area (where only the drossing operation requiresventilation) was 450 cfm. As was the case for older plants, newer plants also have two of each typeof area requiring ventilation. Total capital costs per facility are thesum of $120,000 for semi-automatic packaging ventilation (two systems at$60,000 each), $13,500 for drossing ventilation (two systems at $6,700each), and $300,000 for automated packaging (two units at $150,000 each).Evidence indicates, however, that improvements in the packaging area areplanned in at least one plant in this category [Ex. 684b, p. 11]; therefore,a baseline factor of 25 percent has been applied for packaging controls.Total incremental costs are thus estimated to average $328,500 per plantfor this equipment. Total incremental annual costs, including annualizedcapital and Oandamp;M expenses, will be $81,074. Costs for improved housekeeping will also be incurred by the three facilitiesin this category. These costs include $50,000 for a central vacuum system(annualized capital and Oandamp;M costs of $12,340), $7,350 for additionallabor, and $50,000 for annual cleaning. Evidence in the record indicatesthat at least one facility has installed ``large vacuum lines'' [Ex. 694-9];a baseline offset of 33 percent has been applied in computing the incrementalcosts of the vacuum system (i.e., the capital cost was reduced by one-thirdin order to account for current compliance levels). Total incremental annualcosts for improved housekeeping are thus $65,618. Total incremental annual costs for this facility category are thus estimatedto average approximately $147,000 per facility. Among a total of six modernized and new plants OSHA believes that no costswill be incurred by lead chemicals facilities which are packaging exclusivelyin bulk, and information in the record indicates that this is the casefor three plants [Ex. 686e. p. 29]. It is reported that these plants haveattained the 50 microgram per cubic meter standard in all operations [Ex.686e. p. 34]. Two new facilities will still use semi-automatic units (packingin bags and/or drums) in response to customer demand [Ex. 694-9, companyB comments, p. 34]. For these facilities, costs for the packaging areaare based on an assumption of two semi-automatic packaging stations. (Evidenceindicates that these new facilities will already have automated units forthat portion of product suitable for automation [Ex. 686e, p. 30]). Totalcapital costs would be $120,000. Total incremental annual costs per facilityfor this equipment, which include annualized capital and Oandamp;M expenses,are estimated to be $29,616. New plants packaging in bags will also require additional housekeeping.Incremental costs are estimated to be $2,450 per year, based on the requirementfor one-half person-hour per day, seven days per week, 50 weeks per yearat an average wage of about $14 per hour. (The one-half person-hour contrastswith the one and one-half person-hour estimate used for older facilitiesand appears justified based upon improved conditions in newer plants).Total annual costs per facility for new plants are estimated to be $32,066.OSHA assumes that annual costs for the sixth plant in this category aresimilar to the $32,066 computed above for the two new plants. Finally, isolation and barrier techniques may be required in some plantsto reduce cross contamination. The necessity for these measures will dependupon the amount of manual packaging done at a particular facility and theeffectiveness of other control strategies. However, the prevalence of manualpackaging is low throughout the industry and the control strategies prescribedshould be effective in controlling exposure levels when implemented properlyas part of an integrated control system. Thus, no costs for barrier techniqueshave been estimated. The costs of an industrial hygiene survey were estimated to be $1,000.The survey was estimated to require two days to complete. Though occasionalreevaluation may be necessary, no recurring costs would be required. It should be noted that to the extent that mechanical conveyance systemsare replaced with pneumatic systems, housekeeping and maintenance costswill tend to be reduced. To the extent that some replacement takes place,OSHA's cost estimates will be overstated. Costs are also overestimatedto the extent that producers are able to shift away from manual packaging.Aggregate industry compliance costs are based on the existence of two olderplants, three relatively new plants, four modernized plants (three of whichwill incur no costs), and two new plants. Total incremental annual costsare expected to be $937,000. There are about 30 additional chemical firms which may be affected by thisrulemaking but for which data were not available. OSHA believes that onlylimited expenditures will be incurred by these firms as each accounts forless than 1 percent of total industry volume of product [Ex. 686e. p. 2].Since OSHA has estimated that, at most, $200,000 in annual costs will berequired by any individual facility, an estimate of $2,000, or 1 percentof the cost to an older plant, provides a conservative estimate of theannual costs of compliance for each of the 30 additional firms. Total industrycosts will thus increase by about $60,000 for the 30 additional chemicalfirms, or to $1 million for all lead chemical firms combined.  <T3>Economic Feasibility. </T3>Price increases required for full pass-throughof compliance costs have been summarized in Table 4. The table lists estimatedsales and compliance costs per facility.

Profits impacts were determined usingan average federal income tax rate of 0.34. <F>Source: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of RegulatoryAnalysis.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Sales per facility were estimated to be 7.7 percent of total industry salesof primary lead chemicals. (This corresponds to a total sales figure of$61,448,727 for these firms, or 85 percent of the 1987 industry total of$72,292,620).Price increases required for older plants to pass through the costs ofthis regulation appear to be about 3.6 percent while increases for relativelynew plants will be about 2.6 percent and increases for modernized and newplants will be about 0.6 percent. (Three plants in the latter categorywill incur no costs and thus will require no price increases). Due to competitionfrom newer, more efficient operations, it is unlikely that older facilitieswill be able to use full cost pass-through as a long term strategy [Ex.686e, p. 39]. The ability of relatively new plants to increase prices willlikewise depend on competition with more efficient operations. Any pass-throughthat does occur will also depend on the price of primary lead (the opportunityto pass costs through may arise when the price of primary lead falls andlead chemical producers realize increased margins) and the extent of foreigncompetition; information presented above suggests that U.S. producers arecurrently competitive with foreign producers. New plants would be in abetter position to pass forward a larger portion of compliance costs, asrequired price increases are smaller and they are better able to cut productioncosts [Tr., pp.1301-2].Estimated profit impacts also appear in Table 4. Profits were estimatedusing the 1986 Dun and Bradstreet rate of return on sales for SIC 2816of 4.9 percent. It should be noted that the tax-deductibility of compliancecosts was taken into account in computing profit impacts. That is, carewas taken to compute before-tax profit before subtracting annual costs.After subtracting annual costs, the appropriate average tax rate (34 percent)was then reapplied to determine after-tax profit net of costs.In the older and relatively new plant categories, these figures suggestthat impacts will be about 49 and 35 percent of profits, respectively.(For one relatively new plant, these impacts were believed to be overstatedsince this plant is a lead stabilizer facility utilizing wet processes).Associated post-compliance ROS rates were estimated to be 2.5 percent forolder plants and 3.2 percent for relatively new plants. OSHA recognizesthat these older facilities may have difficulty in financing the costsof the standard. However, an LIA economist emphasized the need for restructuringif the industry was to remain competitive:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * I think the alternatives of the lead chemical industry are prettycircumscribed here, and it is the alternative of cutting costs by buildingnew plants and equipment, getting new efficiencies, getting new productivity,and lowering their costs [Tr., pp. 1301-1302].</ITAG>Industry's recognition of the need to revitalize and replace obsolete equipmentis also reflected in comments submitted by company ``B'' for the record,which indicate that, in addition to those firms constructing new plants,``[o]ne other company plans to modernize and modify two of its facilities''[Ex. 694-9, company B comments, p. 34]. Company ``B'' also reported that``Eagle-Picher recently completed a major capital project to modernizeits lead oxide and lead chemical manufacturing facilities'' [Ex. 694-9,company B comments, p. 2]. Additionally, testimony was presented whichindicated that each of the major lead chemicals producers had already committedin excess of $2 million to engineering control programs [Tr., p. 1285].For the modernized and new plant category, the figures suggest that profitswill decline less than 8 percent for three of the six facilities in thiscategory. Associated post-compliance ROS was estimated to be 4.5 percentfor these plants. Thus, these firms should be able to finance the costsof this rulemaking without particular difficulty.OSHA notes that three of the five LIA member firms represent over 80 percentof the collective capacity of the LIA members. Each of these firms operatesat least one facility for which profit impacts should be relatively low.The owner of one of the two older plants also operates a new facility;the owner of the second older plant also owns two relatively new plants,one of which is a lead chemical (as opposed to lead oxide) facility, andexposure data indicate that this plant is close to compliance [Ex. 686E].The third firm operates four new and modernized facilities, three of whichwill incur no cost. For these three firms, the most severe impact at plantlevel could be mitigated by absorbing compliance costs from overall profits.Based on this analysis, the Lead Chemicals industry should be able to withstandthe impacts of this regulation with an extended compliance schedule offive years. This extended period is required due to the limited abilityof firms to raise prices and the substantial impacts on profitability forolder and relatively new plants. The extended schedule will provide opportunitiesto increase production efficiency and phase in engineering controls. Asmodernization activities progress, exposure levels can be expected to fall,thus reducing the need for capital investments solely for the purpose ofcontrolling employee exposure to airborne lead.OSHA concludes that this standard as it applies to the lead chemicals industryis economically feasible with a five year compliance schedule. Over one-halfof the facilities in this sector fall into the categories of modernizedand new plants. At least three of these plants package exclusively in bulk[Ex. 684c, p. 5], and will incur no costs. Evidence indicates that profitimpacts on the remainder of the plants in this category should not placeundue burden on their profitability. As modernization continues, olderand relatively new plants will either be phased out or made more efficient.Both of these responses to prevailing economic trends will tend to reduceemployee exposures and, hence, the annual costs associated with this rulemaking.Further, more efficient operations would be better able to absorb any costsof compliance. The impacts of this rulemaking should not threaten industryexistence, though the phasing out of marginal, older operations could beaccelerated.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Lead Chromate Pigments </ITAG><T3>Process Description_Overview. </T3>The principal pigment produced inthis industry is lead chromate (chrome yellow), which is produced througha series of chemical reactions and physical processes. At the outset, leadnitrate and sodium chromate solutions are prepared and reacted to produceslurries and precipitate the pigment. The precipitate is then separatedfrom the mother liquor, and washed, dried, ground, and sometimes blendedwith other compounds to produce particular colors. Finally, it is packagedfor sale. These operations can be carried out in batch, continuous, orby a combination of the two (semi-continuous). The specific colors obtainable with lead chromate pigments range from lightyellow and greenish yellow through orange to red. Lighter shades of yelloware produced by coprecipitating lead sulfate with lead chromate. Orange/redpigments are produced by partially replacing sodium chromate with sodiummolybdate to produce a mixture of lead chromate and lead molybdate. Alkalineconditions are used to produce basic lead chromate, called chrome orange.Chrome greens are blends of chrome yellow (lead chromate) and iron blues,which are non-chromium pigments. <T3>Solution and Slurry Preparation. </T3>The first step in producing leadchromate is preparation of solutions and slurries to feed into the precipitationtanks. One of these solutions is lead nitrate, which can be made by reactingmetallic lead or slurried lead oxide (litharge) with nitric acid (Ex. 684hand Tr. 1163). The other solutions, sodium chromate, sodium bichromateand sodium molybdate, can either be purchased as solutions or preparedfrom dry compounds. <T3>Reaction. </T3>The second step in pigment production is the reactionof lead nitrate, sodium chromate and, depending upon the pigment to beproduced, possibly other ingredients to produce lead chromate, sometimeswith lead sulfate. The reactions can be conducted by a batch or continuousprocess. The reaction is complex and must be carefully controlled to yieldthe right types and sizes of crystals. The conditions under which reactionand crystallization occur, such as temperature, concentration, and lengthof time in the reactor, affect particle size, which in turn affects finalcolor. The slurry of crystals produced by the reaction is then subjectedto several physical operations intended to separate the crystals from themother liquor. <T3>Filtration and Washing. </T3>The slurry is pumped to filter presses,centrifuges, or drum filters, where the solids are separated from the liquorand washed. Only filter presses require manual handling. <T3>Drying. </T3>After they have been filtered and washed. the wet solidsare dried. However. in at least one plant, the wet solids are reslurriedbefore being pumped into a spray dryer. Drying can be accomplished in beltdryers, spray dryers, and tray dryers. Of the three, tray drying is theonly one that involves manual handling of the pigments. Where spray dryers are used, the wet solids are reslurried and pumped intothe spray dryer. The slurry is then sprayed into a hot gas stream, andthe dried powder is collected for conveying to the next step in the process.In belt drying, the wet solids are automatically spread onto a conveyorbelt, which passes through a drying oven. From the oven, the dried solidscontinue to be automatically conveyed to the next stage. In tray drying, which is limited to batch processes, workers manually spreadthe wet solids onto trays and load the trays onto racks in cars. Workersthen insert the cars into oven dryers. After the pigment is dry, workersremove the cars from the ovens and discharge the dry, lump pigment fromthe trays into interim containers for subsequent grinding, perhaps blending,and packaging (Ex. 640, pp. 1-2). <T3>Grinding. </T3>The dry pigment is ground in pulverizing equipment,which generally is fed automatically, but in some batch processes pigmentmay be fed manually. Grinding is carried out to achieve certain shadesto meet customer specifications. <T3>Blending. </T3>Blending involves mixing different batches of dry pigmentto meet product specifications (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p.16: Tr. 1185). Dozensof pigment grades are produced. In the batch process, the pigments canbe loaded manually or automatically into the blending equipment. Rotatingor ribbon blenders are used to blend the dry pigment. In at least one plant,some blending is carried out prior to drying by adding dry pigment to thepigment slurry in a ventilated tank (Ex. 684h, p. 2). <T3>Packaging. </T3>Most of the lead chromate pigment produced by thisindustry is in the form of a fine, dry powder. A limited amount of thefinal product may be sold as slurry or paste. The dry product is packagedin either paper bags, drums, or bulk shipping containers, such as air pallets.The majority of the product is packed on bagging machines into paper bags.For packaging in paper bags, the pigment is automatically fed into a hopperlocated over the bagging machine, from which it flows by gravity to themachine below. The bagging operator places a bag on the filling spout,and the machine fills the bag to the set cut-off weight. As the bag isbeing filled, the machine exhausts the displaced air from the bag. Whenthe bag is filled, the operator removes it and places it on a scale besidethe bagging machine. If the bag is underweight or overweight. the operatoruses a trowel and a bucket of pigment to manually add or remove small amountsof pigment to meet the tolerances, which can be as narrow as plus or minus2 oz. for a 50-lb. bag (Tr. 1188). The operator then closes the bag byfolding the bag valve into it, and stacks it on a pallet.<T3>Cleanout.</T3> Cleanout involves opening up and reaching into and evengetting inside production equipment to clean out accumulated lead pigmentresidues. With product changeovers, the equipment must be thoroughly cleanedbefore switching to a new product in order to prevent contamination ofthe new color by the old. The frequency or extent of cleanouts can be reducedby scheduling production in ``campaigns.'' In campaigns, the order of productionminimizes the changes in color from one product to the next by producinglighter shades first and moving progressively to production of darker shadesof the same color. The need for cleanout is also eliminated or reducedby dedicating an entire production line to a single color or group of closely-relatedcolors. In one plant, for example, one line is dedicated almost solelyto production of traffic yellow, while another line is reserved for molybdateoranges (Ex. 684h, p.1). When product changeover cleanout is required, the process vessels, conveyors,mills, dryers, product collection equipment, etc., must be manually openedup and cleaned. At Heubach, for example, cleanout includes high-pressurewater cleaning of process tanks, vacuuming and washing out dryers, andvacuuming material transfer equipment, including screw conveyors and bucketelevators. Cleanout of the continuous production line at Heubach takesfrom 28-48 hours and is said to be carried out approximately 5 times everytwo months (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 3). The basic operations in pigment production can be organized batch by batch,by continuous process, or by various combinations of the two. <T3>Batch Process.</T3> The batch process, which accounts for between 14-20%of total industry capacity, involves production of a fixed amount of aparticular pigment in one or more batches (Exs. 694-5, p. 4; 694-8A, p.3; and 686I, p. 2; Tr. 1169). The process has two basic uses. One is toproduce small amounts of pigments in a relatively simple manner. The otheris to provide the flexibility to produce a wide variety of distinct productsto meet varying customer demands. The customizing can begin at the reaction stage, where precisely measuredquantities of ingredients are mixed, reacted and precipitated under carefullycontrolled conditions to produce particular pigments. Additional modificationsof the properties of the product can be effected in the grinding and blendingoperations. Because a limited amount of pigment is involved in each batch, industrynormally uses filter presses and tray dryers in producing the dry pigment.These operations require considerable manual manipulation and transportationof the material, making them potential sources of high exposure to lead.After the pigment is dried and ground, it frequently is blended with differentbatches to meet specifications. <T3>Continuous Process.</T3> The continuous process is used for high volumeproduction and is characterized by a continuous and steady flow of ingredientsand products through the stages of production. Generally, manual materialhandling between the reactor and packaging stages is eliminated or minimized.With high volume production of a particular pigment, the number of productchangeover cleanouts also is reduced. In a fully continuous reaction process, ingredients are fed into the reactorat the beginning of the process at a carefully controlled rate. The slurryfrom the reactor is continuously pumped to centrifuges or drum filtersto separate and wash the pigment precipitate. The dewatered pigment isdischarged continuously to a dryer and automatically conveyed from thedryer to a grinder. From the grinder the pigment is conveyed to hoppersfor subsequent packaging. With full automation of the production line tofacilitate the continuous flow, continuous filters and dryers, for example,are used instead of filter presses and tray dryers. Thus, the product isno longer manually unloaded and transferred from the filters to the dryertrays or manually dumped from dryer trays. Batch processing may be integrated into an otherwise continuous processat various stages. For example, at Harshaw/Filtrol the pigment is precipitatedin a batch reaction and is thereafter continuously processed. One major production advantage of continuous processing is that a relativelyhigh-quality product can be produced in high volume continuously over anextended period of time because process conditions and ingredient flowscan be continuously monitored and adjusted to keep the properties of thefinal product within specifications. The major health and safety advantageis that, by eliminating intermediate manual handling between process stagesand by minimizing the number of cleanouts, potential sources of high exposureare greatly reduced or eliminated. <T3>Sources of Exposure.</T3> Although some level of exposure to lead maybe associated with nearly every operation in lead chromate pigment production,the Dry Color Manufacturers Association (DCMA), the industry's trade association,concedes that ``it is feasible to meet * * * 50 mg/m\3\ * * * through theuse of engineering and work practice controls in most operations.'' DCMAbroadly identifies the problem areas in which it asserts 50 mg/m\3\ cannotbe achieved as drying, blending, packaging, extraordinary maintenance operations,and product changeover cleanout (Ex. 694-8A, p.2. Ex. 582-18, p. 12-13).In drying, the major source of exposure is tray drying, which is used onlyin batch processes. Employees are exposed to airborne lead in tray dryingfrom dried residues on the trays dispersed during loading the press cakeand moving the cars, and from dumping pigment from the trays. In blending, the main problem again is limited to the batch process, whereemployees may be exposed to high air lead levels if dry pigment is manuallydumped into the blender. In continuous processing, employees also may beexposed to airborne lead above the PEL if they manually dump bags of dry,off-grade product into slurry tanks (Ex. 694-5, p. 8). In packaging, exposure problems may occur throughout the process of packagingpigment in paper bags. Puffs of pigment may escape when the bag is beingfilled, removed from the filling spout, closed, placed on the pallet, andpressed down by other bags stacked upon it. Lead dust also may be spilledwhen manual adjustment of bag weight is required to meet strict customerweight specifications. Finally, lead dust may be dispersed if a bag ofpigment is ruptured during handling. In addition to the potential sources of exposure associated with the particularproduction operations listed above, employees may be exposed to other possiblesources of lead dust. Generally, for example, an employee may be exposedto lead if a spill or a leak occurs somewhere in the production process,the product is dry or dries, and something causes the lead dust to becomeairborne. For minor spills or leaks, exposure levels ordinarily shouldbe below 50 mg/m\3\. Maintenance and product changeover clean-out provide other potential sourcesof lead exposure. High exposures to lead may occur during these operationswhen the equipment is first opened if the residue accumulated inside isdry and becomes airborne. High exposures also may occur thereafter if cleanoutis performed dry and part of the residue being removed becomes airborne.<T3>Existing Exposure Levels. </T3>OSHA in the 1987-88 phase of this rulemakingreceived exposure data from only two of the five remaining companies inthe industry, Heubach and Harshaw/Filtrol (HF). Their data are the mostextensive and useable recent data OSHA has received. By contrast, DCMAdid not provide any data to the record. Instead, without identifying itssources or explaining its methodology. DCMA simply characterizes as aboveor below 50 mg/m\3\ unspecified air lead levels in six job categories (Ex.582-l8, p. 16).Together, Heubach and Harshaw/Filtrol represent 88% of industry productioncapacity and account for approximately 69% of the lead-exposed employeesin the industry (Ex. 686I, pp. 2, 12). As a result, OSHA, like Meridian,focuses its analysis of industry exposures on their data. Of the two, Heubachis by far the largest producer and employer, with more then one-half oftotal production and employment in the industry (Exs. 686I, pp. 2, 12;582-16, Att. I, p. 5; and 694-5, p. 4).In analyzing the data from Heubach and HF, OSHA notes that job classificationsare not defined uniformly across the industry. Consequently, for purposesof determining feasibility, the Agency has conducted its analysis in termsof common production operations employed by a ``typical'' facility. Thisapproach is consistent with the requirements of the OSH Act. <T3>USWA </T3>v.<T3> Marshall,</T3> 647 F.2d at 1272.OSHA also is conscious of the fact that the data from Heubach and Harshaw/Filtrolmay be upwardly biased in several respects. First, to the extent that airlead monitoring is performed in accordance with the frequency requirementsof the lead standard, the number of samples taken per year increases withexposure levels. According to the lead standard, if exposure levels arebelow 30 mg/m\3\, no further monitoring is required; if exposure levelsare at or above 30 mg/m\3\ but at or below 50 mg/m\3\, monitoring is requiredsemi-annually; and if exposure levels are above 50 mg/m\3\, quarterly monitoringis required. Thus, if everything else is equal, there will be twice asmany sampling results for operations with exposure levels above 50 mg/m\3\than for operations between 30 mg/m\3\ and 50 mg/m\3\. Second, at least with regard to the Heubach data, Heubach states that somevery high exposure readings (e.g., 730 mg/m\3\) are attributable to monitoringproblems, such as ``a glob of pigment'' falling on the personal monitorand being taken to represent air lead levels (Tr. 1176).Third, although most measurements for a particular job may be below 50mg/m\3\, the average for that job still may be above 50 mg/m\3\ becauseproduction workers do cleanout, during which very high exposures are experienced.Characteristically for these jobs, relatively moderate sampling resultsobtained during routine operations are submerged in calculations of averageexposure levels by a few very high results obtained during periodic clean-outwork, which is like a maintenance activity.At Heubach, in the years 1984 through 1987 for which the company providedOSHA with exposure data, 71-75% of all employees and 66% of all samplingresults are at or below 50 mg/m\3\ (Tr 1175; Ex. 686I, pp. 13-14). In addition,for the combined years 8 of 12 job classifications have 50% or more oftheir air lead samples at or below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686I, p. 14; see Table1, below). In continuous processing, which accounts for 75% of Heubach'stotal production and within the next year or two is expected to accountfor nearly all production, Heubach reports that all employees are alreadyat or below, or at least able to achieve 50 mg/m\3\ , except those in packaging(e.g., chemical operator) and cleanout. In batch processing, which involvesmanual handling of the product at many points, Heubach also reports thatall employees, except those in blending (inorganic finishing, the processoperator), packaging (inorganic finishing, the unit operator) and cleanout(inorganic finishing, both the process and unit operators), already areat or below 50 mg/m\3\ or at least are able to achieve 50 mg/m\3\ (Tr.1163-66 and 1168-70).Thus, in two of the five operations in which, according to DCMA, 50 mg/m\3\cannot be achieved (Ex. 694-8A, p. 2). Heubach already is achieving thatlevel most of the time. In maintenance, 87% of the sampling results formaintenance workers are at or below 50 mg/m\3\ (see Table 1, below). Similarly,in drying, approximately 53% of all the samples are at or below 50 mg/m\3\(see Table 1, below, exposure levels for Processing_Process Operator andEx. 640, job description).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Summary of Exposure Data for Heubach Inc., 1984-87</T4><H1>Job classification</H1><H1>Number of employees</H1><H1>Distribution of exposure level</H1><H2>1984 (percent)</H2><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H2>1985 (percent)</H2><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H2>1986 (percent)</H2><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H1> </H1><H2>1987 \3\ (percent)</H2><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H2>Combined Years (percent)</H2><H3>andgreater;50 </H3><H3>andgreater;50 </H3>Semi-Finished<ITAG tagnum="2">Chemical Operator<D>4</D><D>82</D><D>18</D><D>67</D><D>33</D><D>82</D><D>18</D><D>40</D><D>60</D><D>72</D><D>28</D></ITAG>Continuous Process<ITAG tagnum="2">Senior Chemical Operator<D>5</D><D>58</D><D>42</D><D>50</D><D>50</D><D>69</D><D>31</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>50</D><D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chemical Operator \1\<D>4</D><D>9</D><D>91</D><D>10</D><D>90</D><D>47</D><D>53</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>26</D><D>74</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Process Operator<D>8</D><D>46</D><D>54</D><D>46</D><D>54</D><D>58</D><D>42</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>41</D><D>59</D></ITAG>Manufacturing<ITAG tagnum="2">Senior Chemical Operator<D>20</D><D>95</D><D>5</D><D>100</D><D>0</D><D>94</D><D>6</D><D>81</D><D>19</D><D>93</D><D>7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Process Operator<D>8</D><D>92</D><D>8</D><D>93</D><D>7</D><D>94</D><D>6</D><D>80</D><D>20</D><D>91</D><D>9</D></ITAG>Processing<ITAG tagnum="2">Chemical Operator<D>4</D><D>100</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>0</D><D>78</D><D>22</D><D>94</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Unit Operator<D>20</D><D>67</D><D>33</D><D>83</D><D>17</D><D>86</D><D>14</D><D>56</D><D>44</D><D>75</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Process Operator<D>8</D><D>31</D><D>69</D><D>76</D><D>24</D><D>71</D><D>29</D><D>35</D><D>65</D><D>53</D><D>47</D></ITAG>Inorganic Finishing<ITAG tagnum="2">Process Operator \2\<D>6</D><D>7</D><D>93</D><D>13</D><D>88</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>0</D><D>100</D><D>5</D><D>95</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Unit Operator \1\ \2\<D>8</D><D>28</D><D>100</D><D>19</D><D>81</D><D>8</D><D>92</D><D>6</D><D>94</D><D>8</D><D>92</D></ITAG>Maintenance<ITAG tagnum="2">General Mechanic<D>49</D><D>93</D><D>7</D><D>90</D><D>10</D><D>83</D><D>17</D><D>82</D><D>18</D><D>87</D><D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Employment/Total Distribution<D>144</D><D>65</D><D>35</D><D>73</D><D>27</D><D>71</D><D>29</D><D>54</D><D>46</D><D>66</D><D>34</D><F>\1\ Operator performs manual packing.</F><F>\2\ Operator performs process equipment cleanout.</F><F>\3\ In 1987, owing to the exiting from the industry of one of the majorproducers, a significant and sudden increase in production levels apparentlyincreased exposure levels substantially above the three preceding years.With this increase in production, existing controls appear to have beendisrupted or their capacity exceeded (Ex. 582-16, Att. I, pp. 3-4). Consequently,OSHA believes that 1987 is not a typical year.</F></ITAG></ITAG>At HF, geometric mean exposure levels during each of the two most recentyears for which data was provided, 1986-87, were well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\for at least 69% of the lead-exposed employees. During those same years,for an additional 14% of lead-exposed employees, the geometric means werebelow 64 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Table 2, below; Ex. 613 B-7). OSHA has derived these geometric means from the individual monitoring resultsprovided by HF (Ex. 613 B-7; see Table 2, below). While these individualmonitoring data cover fewer years than the data summary HF provided (Ex.694-5), OSHA has found errors in the summary for the years 1984-87, forwhich HF also provided individual monitoring results. OSHA therefore doesnot feel it can rely on the summary. The entire set of monitoring results includes only 46 samples taken overthe years 1984-1987 and covers only five job classifications and 18 ofthe 36 employees identified by the company as exposed to lead (Ex. 694-5,p. 5). OSHA understands that the reason no data were submitted for theother job classifications is because HF was under no legal obligation tomonitor other employees and did not do so. Monitoring is not required foremployees whose exposure levels are below the action level, 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\(29 CFR 1910.1025 (d)(6)(i)). OSHA further understands that HF is complyingwith requirements of the lead standard for monitoring frequency and thatthe 18 employees for whom no monitoring data were provided were exposedbelow 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Concerning the lead-exposed employees for whom data are provided, 7 ofthe l8 are color makers and utility workers. In 1984-87, 80% of their samplingresults were at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Only the 11 spray dryer operatorsworking on production lines A, B, and C frequently had average annual exposurelevels above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. HF itself has stated that the only job categorywith frequent lead exposures over 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is spray dryer operator(Ex. 582-17, p. 5). These operators run filters and spray dryers, cleanclarification presses, dump pigment from bags into the slurry/holding tanksfor blending, and fill bags on the packaging machines. Several of thesetasks currently are associated with high exposure levels. However, of the 11 spray dryer operators at HF, 5 work on line A, wherethe geometric mean exposure levels for 1986 and 1987 were 28 andCx.18;g/m\3\and 63 andCx.18;g/m\3\, respectively. OSHA notes that line A is almost exclusivelydedicated to the production of traffic yellow, which is low-grade, maybe coarser and less dusty, and involves long runs requiring relativelyfew cleanouts. Lines B and C, which each have three employees, are thedustiest lines in the company. Line B produces a variety of higher qualityyellow pigments of different hues and more stringent quality specificationsthan line A, so the operator on line B must frequently perform blendingand cleanout of equipment. Line C produces a molybdate chrome orange pigment,which the company admits is dustier than the other pigments. In addition,HF has recognized that the work practices of one of the spray dryer operatorson line C account for his higher exposures and contribute to higher averageexposure levels on line C. Nevertheless, even on lines B and C more than66% of total sampling results from 1984-87 were below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="21"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,s50,10,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.1,8.1</C><T4>Table </T4>2._Summary of Exposure Data for Harshaw-Filtrol, 1984-87\2\<H1>Job classification</H1><H1>Geometric mean lead exposures</H1><H2>No. of employees</H2><H2>1984</H2><H2>1985</H2><H2>1986</H2><H2>1987</H2><H1>Combined years \3\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Colormaker<D>5</D><D>28</D><D>66</D><D>24</D><D>14</D><D>33.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Utility<D>2</D><D>52</D><D>26</D><D>22.9</D><D>25</D><D>28.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Laborers<D>3</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lab.

Even in the packaging operation,the exposure level was only 66 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 476-264). Moreover, theKikuchi plant representative indicated at the time that the exhaust systemfor the packager was being upgraded and that he hoped levels would soonbe below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in that operation as well (Ex. 476-264). Kikuchi, built in 1979, is a highly automated plant with a single continuousline exclusively dedicated to the production of traffic yellow. Consequently,product-changeover cleanouts are not necessary. No dry blending is performedand all steps after the reactor stage are automated and enclosed. Undersuch conditions, it is clear that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ not only can be, butis being achieved in all operations, with the possible exception of packaging.<T3>Existing Controls. </T3>OSHA's discussion of current exposure levelsin the previous section indicates that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ already is beingachieved most of the time with existing controls in most of the operationsin the industry (See Table 1, above, Combined Years). The primary methodscurrently used to control air lead levels in lead pigment production arework practices and housekeeping, ventilation, and use of automated processingequipment. In addition, both Heubach and HF, which account for 88% of totalindustry production, have developed reduced-dust pigments that reduce thedust-generating properties of their products up to eight-fold (Ex. 684h,p. 3; Tr. 1156). <T3>Solution and Slurry Preparation. </T3>Although OSHA has obtained relativelylittle information on controls used in this area, industry has concededthat 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is being achieved currently and that this operationis not a problem area (Ex. 694-8A, p. 2). Colormakers' exposure to leadin this operation is intermittent since they spend only 10 minutes in thisarea twice a day (Ex. 684h). HF has been able to maintain this operationat or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by enclosing it in a separate building, segregatingthe lead oxide in closed bins outside that building, automatically conveyingthe lead oxide and the lead nitrate slurry without manual handling, andventilating the weigh hopper (Ex. 684h). At Heubach, which melts lead ingotsin electric furnaces to react with nitric acid, employee exposures aremaintained below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ during this operation (Tr. 1163). <T3>Reaction. </T3>Industry also concedes that this is not a problem operationsince at this stage the lead-bearing materials are wet. At Heubach, tocontrol air lead levels the synthesis tanks have closed tops and are connectedto a central exhaust system (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 11; Tr. 1167). <T3>Filtration and Washing. </T3>Industry acknowledges that exposure levelsin filtration and washing already are being controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.The most effective engineering control for this operation is using continuousprocess equipment rather than batch process. To control air lead levelsin this operation, HF and Kikuchi, for example, use drum filters and centrifuges,respectively, rather than filter presses, which require manual handling(Exs. 582-17, p. 2; 579, p. 21). This production equipment lends itselfto a greater degree of enclosure and automation (Ex. 579, p. 21). At HF, the drum filters filter and wash the pigment automatically; thusthe only manual handling required is cleaning the clarification presses.At HF, the presses and trays now are wetted down before opening, scrapingand dumping to prevent dried pigment residue from becoming airborne (Ex.694-5, p. 9). <T3>Drying. </T3>DCMA identifies drying as an operation that cannot becontrolled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ because manual loading and unloading isinvolved (Ex. 694-8A, p. 2). However, as OSHA has shown in the previoussections, the three largest lead pigment producers have almost completelyreplaced manual tray drying with belt or spray drying as part of theirconversion to continuous process. Thus, manual handling in drying operationsis limited to situations where pigment is being produced by the batch process,which amounts to less than 20% of total industry production (Exs. 694-5,p. 4; 694-8A, p. 3; and 686I, p. 2; Tr. 1169). In the batch process at Heubach, where manual tray drying is used, airlead levels are controlled by locating tray dumping in a ventilated booth,which has a minimum 300 fpm face velocity (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 13).A hoist system is used to raise or lower cars, providing better controlof resulting exposures. A monorail system instead of manual labor is usedto move and stage dryer cars. In addition, dryer cars are unloaded in aseparate building area. Heubach also controls exposures by rotating employeeswith those doing non-lead pigment dumping in adjacent booths (Tr. 1164).In the continuous process, exposure levels are controlled to or below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the drying operation because spray and belt dryers runas closed systems that are automatically fed and discharged using conveyorsor other mechanical transport systems. In addition, at Heubach the enclosedbelt dryers are operated at negative pressure and exhausted to a wet scrubber(Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 13). <T3>Grinding. </T3>DCMA concedes that in grinding 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ alreadyis being achieved or can be achieved (Ex. 694-8A, p. 2). To control airlead levels at Heubach, pulverizing equipment is enclosed, exhausted andplaced in a separate finishing area (Ex. 582-16. Att. II, p. 11). The entirefinishing area, which includes grinding, blending and packaging operations,has a central exhaust system and dust collector. Heubach also has controlledemployee exposures in this operation by installing separate grinding lines,each dedicated to different product groups (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 2).This reduces the need for cleanout. Exposure levels in continuous processesare controlled by the pigment being automatically conveyed to and fromthe grinding equipment, which eliminates the need to manually load andunload the dry pigment (Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 3). <T3>Blending. </T3>In blending, exposure problems are again limited tothe batch process, where employees manually load dry pigment into blenders.At Heubach the blending operation is located, along with grinding and packagingoperations, in a separate area of the plant. At the blending area exposurelevels are controlled by local ventilation at loading stations, where thebags are slit and their contents charged into the blender (Ex. 582-16,Att. II, p. 12). On continuous process lines, where dry, off-grade pigment is worked backin, exposure levels are controlled by ventilating the dumping stations,dumping the off-grade pigment into a slurry rather than dry pigment, andventilating the slurry tank. <T3>Packaging. </T3>In packaging, identified exposure problems are limitedto packing the product in paper bags. To some extent pigment producershave eliminated this problem by switching to packaging pigment in bulkbags, air pallets and shipping pigment in slurry or paste form.Where packaging is done in paper bags, air lead levels are controlled atHeubach's 7 packaging stations by using custom-designed auger packers,which minimize the need for manual weight adjustment. At the packer spout,air lead levels are controlled by point source ventilation and an exhaustedcatchpan, which picks up droppings from the spout. In addition, exposurelevels at the check weigh scale are controlled with point source ventilation(Ex. 582-16, Att. II, p. 11). At HF, exposure levels are controlled by dedicating each of its three productionlines to a different product group, thus reducing the number of necessarycleanouts in many operations including packaging. On line A, dedicatedalmost exclusively to production of traffic yellow, air lead levels atthe delivery tube are controlled by a circular exhaust duct with a shroudhood. On line B, in which a variety of yellow lead pigments are producedin campaigns, the packaging machine is in a hood that surrounds it on threesides and has an overhead exhaust. In addition, the weighing station ispartially ventilated. On line C, which is dedicated to production of molybdateoranges, a walk-in slot hood with exhaust slots at the back of the hoodencloses the bagging and weighing station (Exs. 582-17, p. 5; 694-5, p.7). <T3>Cleanout. </T3>The major methods currently used to reduce high exposurelevels in cleanout are elimination of cleanout and reduction in its frequency.At Kikuchi and almost completely on line A at HF, product changeover cleanoutshave been eliminated by dedicating each production line to a single product,traffic yellow. HF and Heubach also are controlling exposure levels incleanout by scheduling their production in campaigns. Where cleanout must be done, Heubach and HF are controlling exposures incertain operations by doing wet cleaning. For example, at HF clarificationpresses are cleaned wet (Ex. 694-5, p. 9). At Heubach, process tanks arewet cleaned and a central vacuum system with portable wet sweepers is alsoused to perform cleanout. <T3>Maintenance and Housekeeping. </T3>At HF, to prevent reentrainmentof lead dust, work areas are vacuumed daily with a HEPA vacuum, certainfloors are washed down and some work areas are kept wet. HF reports thata floor scrubber has been purchased to assist in removing pigment residues.In addition, personal vacuums equipped with HEPA filters are stationedat various points in the plant so employees can decontaminate their clothingbefore going to the lunchroom or leaving the premises. At Heubach portable floor scrubbers are used to remove pigment residuesand spills in the batch process area. For the continuous-process area,a vacuum is located at the bagger to clean up spills. <T3>Major Process Modification or Substitution. </T3>HF and in large partHeubach have switched production from batch processing to various formsof continuous processing. From the viewpoint of exposure control, the fullycontinuous nature of the process itself is the key control. Manual handlingof product, where employee exposures are the greatest, has been replacedwith automated and enclosed conveyors, or the operations requiring manualhandling have been entirely eliminated, except for packaging. At Kikuchi and HF, continuous processing has been combined with dedicatinga production line to a single product or product group. On these lines,blending of dry pigment has been eliminated and product changeover cleanoutshave been significantly reduced or eliminated. Thus, employees are notexposed to the high air lead levels customarily encountered in these operations.In addition to converting to continuous processing, Heubach and HF arecontrolling exposure levels by producing a dust-reduced product, whichreduces the dust-generating properties of their products by up to eight-fold(Ex. 684h, Tr. 1138, 1156, 1179). HF's dust-reduced product accounts for25% of the company's total production, and the company is working to broadencustomer acceptance of the product. In November 1987, Heubach reportedthat 33% of its production had been converted to the dust-reduced productand that 50% of its sales in the two months preceding the hearing had beenof that product (Tr. 1139). Finally, Heubach lists other controls which it has implemented in the batchprocess operations. These include exhaust hoods at all pigment dumpinglocations, a conveyor system for removing pigment drums, and a separatetote bin storage area. However, Heubach has not identified where in itsbatch operation these controls have been installed. <T3>Additional Controls. </T3>Based upon the discussion above, OSHA hasdemonstrated that the operations that currently present serious problemsto the industry in consistently achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ are packagingand clean-out, which are common to both batch and continuous processing,and to a lesser extent, dry blending, which is exclusive to batch processing.<T3>Packaging. </T3>Generally within the industry, the packaging operationis one of the main contributors to high exposure levels for employees forwhom packaging is a major portion of their job. At HF, for example, spraydryer operators average 20 minutes every hour packing bags (Ex. 684h, p.4). OSHA recommends four methods for controlling existing lead emissions inpackaging. They are: Further reducing or eliminating packaging by shippingmore product in bulk or semi-bulk form; converting product to the extentpossible to dust-reduced product; where necessary, purchasing and installingthe new and highly accurate packaging machines and appropriately reducingthe variety of packages provided customers; or enclosing each packing andpalletizing station with a side-ventilated booth (Exs. 582-16; 582-90,Appendix C, p. 3; 686I, pp. 24-25; Tr. 1139, 1156, 1283). These controlmethods can be employed independently or in combination to achieve employeeexposure levels lower than 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. However, OSHA believes itis unlikely that any facility would have to extensively implement morethan one of these recommended controls to achieve this level.OSHA's preferred method for controlling exposures associated with packagingis to encourage the lead pigments industry to further reduce the amountof product that is packaged by shifting increasingly to bulk and semi-bulkshipping. OSHA believes that large producers in the industry can persuademore of their customers to accept bulk and semi-bulk shipment. However,OSHA recognizes that there may be a substantial portion of product thatwill have to continue to be packaged. For that portion, OSHA recommendsthat industry implement any one, or a combination of the three followingcontrol methods. The first is to fully convert all product to dust-reduced product. OSHAbelieves that this step alone would dramatically reduce exposure levelsfor packagers, and other employees, since dust-reduced products reducedusting properties of products by up to eight-fold (Tr. 1156). Reduced-dustproducts, which HF is producing and to which Heubach stated it would convertall of its pigments by mid-1988 (Tr. 1139), should significantly reduceexposure levels in certain dry pigment operations, including at least blendingand packaging (Tr. 1156). The second method is to mechanize and automate packaging and subsequentbag handling. For bags that do not have to be packed to precise weightspecifications, conventional automatic packaging machines that fill andseal bags have been available and in use in many plants for years. Today,even for bags that require filling to precise weight specifications, automaticpackaging machines are available that ``can easily achieve accuracies of0.25% and sometimes even * * * 0.1% * * *'' (Ex. 582-90, Appendix C, p.3). This means that for a 50-pound bag, the machine can automatically andaccurately  fill the bag to within 2 ounces and less and can then sealthe bag, all routinely and without manual intervention. Based upon industrystatements regarding the weight tolerances required by some customers (Tr.1187), OSHA concludes that nearly all orders can be bagged on these moreaccurate packaging machines. The number of bags that might still requiremanual weight adjustment, therefore, should be extremely small. Consequently, if achieving precise weight specifications is the only problemin bagging, emissions associated with manual interventions can be strictlycontrolled or effectively eliminated by mechanization. However, if customersseek many different kinds of packages, this may cause a problem, becauseno single machine can handle a wide variety of packages. The industry,of course, could satisfy all the packaging demands of customers and fullyautomate packaging by purchasing and installing a sufficient number ofthe more advanced bagging machines. If the cost for such automation were too high, industry could reduce costsif it provided customers with a more limited variety of bags. This wouldreduce the number of advanced automatic bagging machines needed. In anyevent, the technology exists and is available. With regard to handling the bags after they have been filled and sealed,OSHA believes that such handling can be mechanized as well. Bags can bemechanically flattened and conveyed (Tr. 1283). Mechanization of this phaseof bag handling should substantially reduce worker exposure from breathingbags, because workers can be removed from proximity to these emission sources.The emissions from flattening, for example, then can be controlled by localexhaust ventilation. The last recommended method for controlling employee exposure levels inthis operation to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is simply to improve the captureof emissions at the existing level of mechanization of production by isolatingthe entire operation and providing effective local exhaust ventilation(Ex. 686I, pp. 24-25). This control strategy needs to be accompanied bythe implementation of strict work practices and preventive maintenanceto assure that local exhaust ventilation is effective. Heubach agrees that better ventilation, among other things, is needed andsuggests that an increase in local exhaust around each bag packing machineand enclosure of each packaging station in its own ventilated room in andof itself would reduce bagging operators' exposures to about 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 582-16). But it also is important that practices that disrupt effectiveventilation and disperse lead be corrected. At HF on line C, for example,a portable cooling fan, which could entrain dust generated by manual weightadjustments, was aimed to blow directly across the weighing station (Ex.684h, p. 4). To be effective, this control strategy has to take account of a numberof factors. Each of the manual tasks in packaging provides a potentialsource of lead exposure. These tasks extend all the way from placing thebag on the bagging machine, through weighing the bag contents, adjustingcontent weight, and sealing the bag, to cleaning the outside of the bagand then stacking it on a pallet. Each of these tasks must be effectivelyexhausted, and the worker must be trained to carry out each task withinthe capture range of the ventilation and in a manner likely to minimizethe amount of lead emission. Obviously, the local exhaust also must beproperly designed, installed, and maintained. It also must be properlylocated and have sufficient capacity to handle the job. Meridian agrees with OSHA that each of the industrial hygiene problemsin packaging can be overcome by using an appropriately configured ventilationsystem and by avoiding certain work practices that tend to defeat ventilation(e.g., carrying pigment out of range of the ventilation in an open containeror bag; not exercising care in weight adjustment, which can result in pigmentbeing spilled; using a broom to sweep pigment away from the work stationor off bags; or improperly using man-cooling fans) (Ex. 686I, pp. 24-25).Ventilation should be configured to encompass all packaging tasks, includingbag filling, weighing, and manual weight adjustment (Ex. 686I, p. 24).Since these operations can be done in a relatively small space, a largeside-ventilated booth could be configured to ventilate all of them. Sucha booth would allow the operator to face into the booth at all times andto move from side to side while packing the bags. This system should also include LEV slots to capture dust that escapesaround the nozzle and an exhausted pan (grill) beneath and in front ofthe bag as it is being filled, to catch any dust which falls from the bagor the machine nozzle. The hood also should be  designed to capture dustfrom bags on the pallet. There should be a vacuum hose for the operatorto use to pick up spilled pigment. According to Meridian, a system with the capacity of 4,000 cfm per packagingstation should be sufficient to control the packers 8-hour TWA exposureto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 686I, p. 28). Such a system involvesonly conventional engineering technology and industrial hygiene practices(Ex. 583-13, Ex. 689-13). Numerous consultants and engineering firms arecapable of providing the services necessary to implement such a system.Several other available controls and work practices, which will be discussedat greater length below, can achieve additional further reductions in airlead levels at packaging stations and elsewhere. For example, strict implementationof improved housekeeping programs can further reduce air lead levels. Inaddition, Meridian's recommendation for installing automatic palletizinglines, as well as for several other controls and practices to reduce airlead levels in packaging (Ex. 686I, pp. 24-25), should be effective inat least some plants. <T3>Cleanout. </T3>High exposure levels in product changeover cleanoutcan be significantly reduced by one or a combination of the following methods:completely eliminating cleanout, reducing its frequency, or improving itscontrol. The ideal way to handle the exposure problems associated with cleanoutis to dedicate a production line to a single product and thereby eliminatethe need for product changeover cleanout. HF examplifies this approach,with a line almost exclusively dedicated to traffic yellow (Ex. 684h, p.3). The method may be applied more broadly throughout the industry if plantsinstall more production lines with smaller capacities, each dedicated toa single product. A second approach is to reduce the frequency of cleanout, which may involvescheduling longer runs of particular products between cleanouts to buildup larger inventories between runs. It also may involve reducing the amountof product that is not produced by the campaign method. It also may bepossible to achieve lower frequency by reducing the number of productsproduced and persuading customers to accept a more limited palette of huesand shades. OSHA recognizes that these two approaches may not be feasible for smallbatch processes because of the need for frequent product changeover. Forthese processes, as well as for others, a third approach is available toimprove the control of cleanout. This has two fundamental elements: designingnew equipment so that it accumulates less residue and is easier to clean;and developing and implementing better and stricter work practices to minimizethe escape of dust when equipment is first opened and thereafter duringactual cleanout. New process equipment should be designed to eliminatecrevices and corners from which it is difficult to remove material; onelead chemicals plant visited by OSHA reported that it already was takingthis approach to facilitate housekeeping (Ex. 684b, p. 10). This designpractice is also followed in the dairy, food and pharmaceutical industries.Water lines, air lines, vacuum lines, and possibly other devices shouldbe built into the equipment to facilitate cleaning. Where possible, cleanoutshould be done by the mechanical action of water. Where that cannot bedone, pigment residues to the extent possible should still be wetted andkept wet while cleanout is taking place. Improved work practices also mayinclude the elimination of inappropriate tools. Thus, at HF, for example,the use of air lances, which rely upon compressed air for cleaning, shouldbe discontinued (Ex. 686I, p. 25). If this final approach does not proveeffective in reducing exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in smallbatch processes, OSHA recognizes that employers may have to rely upon respiratorsfor supplemental protection of employees. <T3>Blending. </T3>In the batch process, and to a lesser degree in thecontinuous process, dry, finished pigments may be blended to meet productspecifications. Blending in the batch process may produce high exposurelevels (See Table 1, above, exposure levels for Inorganic Finishing_ProcessOperator and Ex. 640, job description). The best way to handle that exposureproblem is, to the extent possible, to convert from batch to continuousprocessing. If production must remain by batch, Heubach recommends investigatingthe use of an automatic bag slitter and dumper to control the exposures(Ex. 582-16, Att. II, pp. 12, 17). Heubach once experimented unsuccessfullywith such a unit, but has done nothing in this regard for 10 years. OSHAalso recommends automating material transfers. Automatic bag slitters andautomated material transfer equipment are available and have proven effectivein reducing employee exposures to toxic substances such as asbestos (51FR 22655; June 20, 1986).In the continuous process at HF, where pigment is reblended to work inoff-grade product, the company has not reported exposure levels to be asubstantial problem. Meridian believes that ventilation will be sufficientto adequately control exposures if bags are opened and dumped within thecapture range of the ventilation system (Ex. 686I, p. 24). This has proveneffective in the manual debagging of asbestos fibers (51 FR 22655; June20, 1986). In addition to the specific engineering and work practice controls directedat controlling exposure levels in the particular problem operations discussedabove, lead pigment plants can and should take a number of more generalizedsteps to reduce exposures throughout the plant. <T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices, and preventive maintenance are critically important controlswhose importance is frequently not adequately recognized by employers.Failure to develop and use rigorous housekeeping, good work practices,and preventive maintenance can destroy the effectiveness of otherwise adequateengineering controls. Central vacuum systems should be installed with outlets widely and convenientlylocated and hoses always available so that both operators and maintenancepersonnel can promptly clean up any spills. When about to open equipmentfor inspection, cleanout, or maintenance, where escape of dust is likely,workers should have a hose ready to capture escaping dust. In addition,in high dust operations such as packaging and cleanout, employees shouldregularly use a vacuum hose to remove loose dust from their clothing beforethey contaminate themselves and other employees. To adequately controlsuch loose dust, it may not be enough to only clean dust off employeesbefore they enter the lunchroom, which is a specific requirement of thelead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025 (i) (4)(iv)). In accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F), written work practice programs,including housekeeping procedures, should be developed by each employer.Housekeeping instructions should be prepared and adherence to them enforcedby employers, with scheduling and checkoff of regular cleaning of all areasof the plant where dust can collect. These instructions should be appropriatelydetailed. If necessary, hundreds of sites, pieces of equipment, parts ofequipment, obscure corners, etc., should be listed in the instructionsto assure that they are cleaned regularly. Written work practices shouldbe developed for activities that could cause dust emission or later dustgeneration when spilled slurry dries. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of housekeeping and workpractices. A small amount of dust dispersed throughout a building's airspace can raise airborne levels. Nevertheless, housekeeping at the HF plant visited by OSHA was poor (Ex.684h, pp. 5-6). Floors, windows, equipment surfaces, and walls were coveredwith dried pigment, the colors of which matched the pigment colors beingproduced in the area. OSHA believes poor housekeeping may account for muchof the plant's difficulty in controlling exposures and, more specifically,may account to a considerable extent for the plant's inability to holdlevels consistently below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for spray dryer operators. In addition to implementing good work practices for housekeeping and cleanupof spills, written work practices should be developed to cover all tasksthat might result in the escape of dust into the workplace. Key tasks requiringcareful adherence to appropriate rules are packaging, clean-out, blending,batch operations where the operators work with filter presses and traydryers, and maintenance work. OSHA believes that development and enforcementof good housekeeping and work practices are absolutely essential to meetthe strict PEL of the lead standard. <T3>Ventilation. </T3>Effective engineering controls, like total enclosure,local exhaust ventilation (LEV), and general ventilation, need to be appliedto emission sources to contain and capture the contaminant and therebyreduce lead exposures. Although much more quantitative information is neededto state with any precision how much reduction of particular exposure levelswould be achieved by enhancement of specific ventilation systems, OSHAhas no doubt that ventilation can be improved in some operations to achievemajor reductions in worker exposure. Where ventilation is inadequate, crosscontamination can become a serious problem. <T3>Enclosure. </T3>Enclosures, often operated at negative pressure, areconstructed around single pieces of equipment or groups of equipment. Docketentries describe use of this standard engineering control technique byKikuchi, Heubach, and HF (Exs. 476-264; 582-16; 582-17). Sometimes, enclosureconsists simply of installing tops on vessels or closing up other openingsto minimize the amount of air that will be drawn through the equipmentwhen it is connected to an exhaust system in order to maintain negativepressure in the equipment. Reaction vessels, slurry tanks, screw conveyorsand elevators can be handled in the latter fashion. In other cases, box-likeenclosures are constructed around the equipment. <T3>Prevention of Cross Contamination. </T3>Cross contamination of onearea with airborne contaminant from another can be prevented by isolatingeither area to keep a contaminant in or out or by using local exhaust ventilationat the source to capture lead emissions before they can escape into thegeneral work environment. DuPont, the prior owner of the Heubach plant,for example, isolated the grinding, blending and packaging operations inthe batch process (the so-called ``finishing'' operations) in a separatebuilding. Heubach has also suggested enclosing each of seven bag packingstations in separate ventilated rooms (Ex. 582-16, Att. II. p. 11). <T3>Major Process Modification or Substitution. </T3>There also are severalavailable processing alternatives that will substantially reduce exposurelevels, most notably conversion to continuous processing and shifting productionto reduced-dust pigments. Some batch operations can be converted to continuous processing. Others,because of the small quantity of product involved, for all practical purposescannot. However, some of these latter may be converted to semi-continuousprocessing, which may offer sufficient flexibility to produce smaller amountsof pigments than can be produced economically by fully continuous processing.In any event, the conversion provides opportunities to eliminate manualhandling of the product and the high exposures associated with such handling.Thus, the high exposures associated with a batch process that employs presses,tray dryers, containers for interim storage, manual transfer of productbetween operations, etc. can be eliminated and the frequency of clean-outsreduced by replacing these operations with more automated and continuousoperations. HF, for example, replaced batch filtration and tray dryingwith drum filtration and spray drying, continuous operations that do notrequire operators to manually load or unload product and transport it tothe next operation (Ex. 476-244). HF, however, retains the flexibilityin this semi-continuous process to economically produce relatively smallquantities of product without the startup losses typically associated withfully continuous processing. HF's approach is one route, short of adoptingHeubach's fully continuous approach, for a company to avoid the exposureproblems of batch processing, while retaining some of its flexibility.Heubach, on the other hand, expects to convert all of its production tocontinuous processing within the next year or two (Tr. p. 1187). This wouldmean that within 2 years approximately 95% of total industry productionwill be by some form of automated continuous processing.In addition to converting to fully or semi-continuous processing, as indicatedabove, leading firms in the industry also are increasingly producing adust-reduced product, which reduces dust generated up to eight-fold (Ex.684h, Tr. 1156). This is a potentially major development, which shouldsubstantially reduce exposure levels in operations that are performed afterthe conversion to dust reduced product, like packaging, and probably duringcleanout of these operations. Heubach, as stated above, expected to produce only dust-reduced productsbefore the end of 1988. Harshaw-Filtrol's dust-reduced product currentlyrepresents 25% of production, and the company is seeking to broaden customeracceptance so it too can further expand production of dust-reduced pigments.Technological Feasibility Conclusion. Based upon its own independent analysisof the evidence in the record and the Agency's experience and expertise,OSHA determines that achieving the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologicallyfeasible by engineering and work practice controls in the lead pigmentsindustry as a whole. OSHA's determination is based upon the following elements.OSHA has shown that air lead levels in most operations in the lead chromatepigments industry already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of thetime. This assessment is supported both by industry statements and Meridian'sanalysis. For example, in HF's final submission to the record, the companystated that ``50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is generally achievable by engineering controlsand work practices in areas of the manufacturing process except for thedry end of the process (the job classification designated as the `SprayDryer Operators' at our facility) and for maintenance or clean-out work''(Ex.694-5, p. 34). At the two major producers in the industry at least 69% of the lead exposedemployees work in operations for which geometric mean exposures alreadyare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or a majority of sampling results already areat or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. These two plants account for approximately88% of total production and 69% of total lead-exposed employees in theindustry. In addition, in a third plant, Kikuchi, which produces only trafficyellow, as early as 1980 all operations were at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,with the exception of packaging. In packaging, where exposures were notfar above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, Kikuchi management anticipated achieving 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the immediate future (Ex. 476-264). Thus, for 3 of 5 plantsin the industry 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is largely being achieved. The remaining2 plants, which account for less than 10% of total industry production,chose not to participate in this rulemaking and did not submit any datato the record. Industry has not disputed the feasibility of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in a plant or production line dedicated to traffic yellow. This is importantsince approximately 20 million pounds, nearly one-third of total industryproduction, is traffic yellow, and Kikuchi produces only one-fifth of this(Tr. 1132-33). Consequently, other plants in the industry, notably includingHeubach, also must be involved in significant production of traffic yellow,which is relatively easily controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For all operations already at or near 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA believes that,if existing controls are not always adequate to routinely achieve air leadlevels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, a modest improvement in controls suchas improved housekeeping, better work practices, better preventive maintenanceand perhaps the addition of simple engineering controls will assure thatexposure levels are consistently controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In addition, OSHA and Meridian have recommended a number of specific engineeringcontrols, work practices, and preventive maintenance and housekeeping measuresthat OSHA believes will bring exposure levels down to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in all other operations, as well, with the probable exceptions of cleanoutand extraordinary maintenance. At various times DCMA has claimed that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is not technologicallyachievable by implementing engineering and work practice controls in atotal of five production and maintenance operations. The five are drying,blending, packaging, extraordinary maintenance, and cleanout (Exs. 582-18.pp. 12-13; 694-8A. pp. 11-13). However, OSHA has demonstrated in previoussections that in two of these operations, drying and maintenance, 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\already is being achieved at Heubach. With regard to the limited numberof maintenance operations where 50 andCx.18;g/m cannot be achieved by meansof engineering and work practice controls, which may be what DCMA refersto as ``extraordinary maintenance.'' OSHA traditionally has recognizedthat such employees will have to rely on respirators for supplemental protection.In a third operation, blending, OSHA also has shown that exposure levelsat both Heubach and HF in continuous processing are not a problem. As for packaging, OSHA has shown that nearly one-half of the employeesat HF who perform packaging operations are spray dryer operators who packagetraffic yellow, which is the single largest-volume pigment produced inthe industry. In 1986-87, the two-year average air lead level for theseoperators was 47 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In light of similar sampling results fromKikuchi, this suggests that packaging traffic yellow pigment can be relativelyeasily controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m3. OSHA, for example, believes that HFcan bring its line A into compliance by isolating it from the two otherlines if further engineering controls are still necessary.In light of these realities, OSHA has focused its analysis on the remaining``problem operations'': blending when part of a batch process, other packaging,and cleanout. With regard to blending in batch processing, OSHA has demonstrated thatHeubach is solving the associated exposure problem by effectively eliminatingbatch processing in a shift of all production to continuous processing(Tr. 1187). HF apparently also does little or no dry batch blending. Elsewhere,where batch processing may continue to be performed, OSHA believes thatthe blending operation can be largely automated by installing automaticbag slitters and dumpers and automatic material transfer conveyors (Ex.582-16, Att. II, pp. 12, 17; and see 51 FR 22655; June 20, 1986). Alternatively,OSHA has shown that some additional blending can be performed wet, as atHF, to adequately control exposure levels (Ex. 684h, p. 2). With thesemodifications, OSHA believes exposure levels in blending can be controlledto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Concerning packaging in general, OSHA recognizes that this is a difficultoperation to control and that effective control demands persistence inimplementing strict work practices, including daily attention to properhousekeeping. Nevertheless, if industry implements the recommendationsOSHA and Meridian have made for improved ventilation, work practices, andhousekeeping, OSHA believes exposure levels can be brought to or closeto 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. With the increasing use of low-dust pigments, whichreduce dust generation by 8-fold, OSHA is confident that packaging canbe controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Finally, product changeover cleanout is probably the most difficult operationin the industry to control. Industry's shift to production of a low-dustproduct should dramatically reduce exposure levels in cleanout of downstreamoperations. In addition, OSHA has recommended that cleanout be eliminatedwhere possible, or that its frequency be reduced and that the sources ofexposure be better controlled while it is being done. Where it remainsnecessary to perform such cleanout, OSHA believes equipment must be carefullyopened and cleaned. The use of compressed air for cleaning should be discontinuedand employers should rely instead upon water cleaning methods and keepingthe pigment wet to the extent possible, or upon alternative mechanicalmethods (Ex. 686I, p. 25). If these recommendations are implemented, OSHAbelieves that exposure levels associated with this operation will be significantlyreduced, conceivably to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For all of the above reasons, OSHA concludes that the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is technologically feasible for the lead chromate pigments industry asa whole. For product changeover cleanout and for the limited amount of packagingof pigment in bags that requires manual weight adjustment, OSHA recognizesthat it may not be possible to reach 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ on a consistent basis.Even if this is so, OSHA points out that the resulting percent of totalemployees exposed above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ would be quite small. At HF, forexample, less than 17% of employees would be exposed above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In any event, since OSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL technologicallyfeasible for the industry as a whole, employers will be required in productchangeover cleanout and packaging that requires manual weight adjustment,as well, to control exposure levels to the PEL or the lowest feasible levelby means of engineering and work practice controls. Where all feasibleengineering and work practice controls have been implemented and employeesperforming these tasks are still exposed above the PEL as an 8-hour TWA,then, so long as all  other  sources  contributing  to  the   8-hour TWAhave also been controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or the lowest feasible level,employers will be required to provide these workers with respirators forsupplemental protection while they are performing these tasks. Industry does not agree with OSHA's determination that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL is technologically feasible. Although all the industry representatives in the 1987-88 phase of thisrulemaking have recognized that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ either is already beingachieved or can be achieved in most of the operations most of the timeby implementing engineering and work practice controls, nonetheless, DCMA,Heubach and HF persist in arguing that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is infeasiblebecause it cannot be achieved in a few operations like cleanout and packaging.OSHA does not have to prove that the PEL has been or can be achieved inall operations all of the time. A standard is technologically feasibleif it can be achieved in most of the operations most of the time. The Agencyhas demonstrated that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ either has been or can be achievedin all operations except perhaps cleanout and extraordinary maintenance,which, in any event, are types of operations in which OSHA has permittedrespirator use to supplement engineering controls.DCMA also argues that OSHA cannot guarantee that its recommended additionalcontrols will work. However, with regard to some of the operations in whichDCMA contends 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved, OSHA has shown 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\already is being achieved (i.e., drying and maintenance). Further, currentexposures for some of the remaining operations are not very high at someplants (i.e., less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\) and OSHA has pointed out feasiblecontrols that have not yet been implemented which are capable of reducingexposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In any case, the courts have ruledthat the OSH Act does not require OSHA to prove to an absolute certaintythat its recommendations will result in the PEL being achieved all thetime. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1266. On the contrary, the courts have heldthat OSHA can require industry to meet PELs never attained anywhere. OSHAbelieves it has more than satisfied its burden of proving technologicalfeasibility for the lead chromate pigments industry. DCMA also has argued that cleanout should not be included in the calculationof the 8-hour, time-weighted average (TWA) for purposes of determiningwhether an employee is exposed above the PEL. OSHA is sympathetic to thenotion that cleanout in some respects is similar to maintenance. OSHA traditionallyhas recognized that certain maintenance operations cannot always be controlledto the PEL by work practice and engineering controls alone. In such circumstances,OSHA has also recognized that supplemental reliance upon respirators toprotect workers may be necessary. Nonetheless, OSHA cannot exclude from the calculation of TWAs an operationlike cleanout, which in this industry appears to be  performed by productionworkers. For these employees, cleanout periodically constitutes an undifferentiatedportion of their 8-hour TWAs. Under such circumstances, an exclusion ofcleanout activities would make interpreting company exposure data and enforcingcompliance with the PEL very difficult for those employees who performcleanout. At HF, for example, all production workers perform equipmentcleanout during product changeovers and thus HF's entire workforce wouldqualify for such an exemption. If it proves to be infeasible to consistently achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in cleanout, industry must implement engineering and work practices toachieve the lowest level feasible in that operation. If exposures for employeeswho perform cleanout still exceed an 8-hour TWA of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, then,so long as all other sources contributing to the 8-hour TWA have also beencontrolled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or the lowest feasible level, employerswill be required to provide these workers with respirators for supplementalprotection while they are performing cleanout. In addition, industry has criticized Meridian's estimates of reductionsin exposure levels to be expected from recommended additional controlsas not grounded in quantitative data. In fact, where useable quantitativedata were available in the record, Meridian relied upon it. Meridian, forexample, did analyze the data in the record and also participated in arecent site visit to HF. Only after that did Meridian rely upon an expertpanel of certified industrial hygienists to independently assess the expectedreduction in exposure levels that would result from implementing certainrecommended additional controls. Based upon all these factors, Meridianconcluded that exposure levels in all operations could be controlled toor below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, except for cleanout and certain maintenanceoperations. In any event, OSHA believes it is appropriate to rely uponexpert opinion and experience if better quantitative data are not available.Reliance upon expert opinion under such circumstances is not unique tothis rulemaking. OSHA has previously relied upon expert opinion and experienceunder similar circumstances in all of its past rulemakings. OSHA believes Meridian has made a reasonable assessment within prevailingtime and resource constraints. In any event, OSHA has not primarily reliedupon Meridian's analysis or estimates. Rather, OSHA has conducted an independentanalysis of the data and looked to Meridian primarily for confirmation.Finally, HF argues, first, that work practices cannot be improved, andsecond, that engineering controls are not correlated with exposure levels.OSHA rejects these arguments. The principles of industrial hygiene andthe exposure data from the lead pigment and other industries indicate thatthis is not the case. OSHA is assured that if HF conducted an industrialhygiene survey, as recommended, the company would recognize specific waysin which its work practices can be improved and in which implementing additionalengineering controls would reduce exposure levels. For example, with regard to engineering controls, HF argues that exposurelevels on line A, which has relatively crude engineering controls, arelower than on lines B and C, which have better engineering controls (Ex.694-5, p. 9). The company, therefore,  suggests that better engineeringcontrols won't necessarily further reduce exposure levels. If everythingelse were equal, this might be a plausible argument. However, everythingelse is not equal. Line A produces traffic yellow, almost exclusively.Consequently, as OSHA indicated previously, there are fewer cleanouts onthat line, the nature of the product apparently causes less generationof dust, and packaging probably requires less attention to meeting narrowweight specifications. HF has also stated that the molybdate oranges being produced on line C,which has the highest average exposure levels, is a dustier product thaneither of the products produced on lines A or B. In addition, HF has recognizedthat the work practices of one of the spray dryer operators on line C accountsfor his higher exposures and contributes to higher average exposure levelson line C (Ex. 684h, p. 7). Thus, neither the facts nor the principlesof industrial hygiene support HF's position. With regard to work practices, HF provides no evidence to support its assertionthat work habits cannot be changed and poor work practices cannot be corrected.OSHA considers this view unacceptable, since it it likely to become a self-fulfillingprophecy. OSHA, along with the industrial hygiene community, believes thatgood work practices should be taught to workers and retaught as often asnecessary. If the work practices are sensible, and the company communicatesto workers its seriousness about requiring that such work practices befollowed, OSHA has no doubt that workers will follow them. No matter whatefforts a company may make to implement effective engineering controls,if its work  practices are poor those controls are likely to be renderedineffective. Indeed, HF has made this very point with regard to one ofits employees on product line C. For all of the above reasons, OSHA concludes that the PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is technologically feasible in the lead pigments industry.<T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Lead Pigments fall under SIC classification2816. The principal lead chromate pigments are chrome yellow, chrome orange,molybdate chrome orange, and chrome green. There are five domestic producers of lead chromate pigments, followingthe withdrawal of two manufacturers, American Cyanamid and Ciba-Geigy,from the lead chromate industry [Ex. 582-161] and the announcement of another,NJZ Colors, that it will abandon its lead chromate production activities[Ex. 694-8, p. 3]. Lead chromate production represents 100 percent of corporate sales forKikuchi, with about 4 million pounds of capacity. Lead chromates constitute50 percent of sales for Heubach, with about 35 million pounds of capacity,30 percent of sales for Harshaw/Filtrol Partnership, with about 20 millionpounds of capacity, and 30 percent of sales for Wayne Chemical, with about3 million pounds of capacity [Tr., p. 1132]. No information was given forthe fifth producer, NL Chemicals; it is assumed that their lead chromatecapacity is relatively small [Ex. 686i, p. 3]. All firms produce lead chromatesin only one facility, though Harshaw/Filtrol and NL chemicals are multi-facilitycorporations. The number of workers exposed to lead in the manufacture of lead pigmentswas reported to be 310 by the Dry Color Manufacturers Association (DCMA)[Ex. 582-18, pp. 14-15]. This total seems consistent with the 1982 estimateof 665 workers. The 1982 estimate was based on twelve producers. In assessing price trends for lead pigments, OSHA found the concept ofunit value to be the accepted measure of value by both the industry andgovernment agencies which collect and report data on lead pigments. Unitvalue is derived as total value of product divided by total volume, expressedin cents per pound. For example, in 1987, the 3,354 metric tons (7,392,216lbs.) of chrome yellow pigment which were imported for consumption hada total value of $5,573,000 [1987 Minerals Yearbook, Bureau of Mines, U.S.Department of Interior]. Unit value for this product was thus 75.4andCx.11;per pound. OSHA compared unit value data as described below. Published data indicate that both the average price of primary lead andthe unit value of imported chrome yellow pigment increased from 1985 to1987 [1987 Minerals Yearbook, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of Interior].(Chrome yellow represents approximately one-third of industry capacity.)Unit value of imports were 70andCx.11; per pound in 1985, 72andCx.11; per poundin 1986, and 75andCx.11; per pound in 1987. Commerce Department data indicatethat domestic unit values of this pigment decreased from 1985 to 1986,from 91andCx.11; per pound to 75andCx.11; per pound, but then increased in1987, rising to 78andCx.11; per pound [Current Industrial Report, InorganicChemicals (MA28A), Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce].Data submitted by Heubach show unit values decreasing over the same threeyear period from 84andCx.11; to 76andCx.11; to 75andCx.11; per pound [Ex. 582-16].Unit value of molybdate chrome orange declined from $1.25 per pound in1986 to $1.16 per pound in 1987 [Current Industrial Report, Inorganic Chemicals(MA28A), Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce]. This pigment is produced in quantities about one-quarter to one-third thatof chrome yellow. Production of lead chromate pigments dropped off about 30 percent between1981 and 1982 but remained stable through 1985 [Ex. 579, p. 7]. No dataon production levels or shipments were provided by industry commentersat the public hearing. However, it was noted that five companies currentlyare operating at increased production levels [Ex. 582-16; Ex. 582-17, p.7]. Domestic shipments of chrome yellow declined 7 percent in 1986 butimproved by this same percentage in 1987. Shipments of molybdate chromeorange declined 6.5 percent in 1987 [Current Industrial Report, InorganicChemicals (MA28A), Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce].Imports of chrome yellow increased over 50% from 1980 to 1985 while importsof chrome green rose from 20 tons in 1983 to over 200 tons in 1985 [Ex.579, pp. 10-12]. Heubach, Inc. noted, however, that ``at the present time,the domestic chromate and molybdate industry is a net exporter'' [Ex. 582-16,response 21]. This apparent conflict was addressed by Meridian:<ITAG tagnum="21">Meridian's analysis * * * indicated that, as of 1985, the unit valueof imports of chrome yellow had fallen to more than 20 percent below theunit value of domestic production, and that imports (especially chromegreen) were increasing. * * * 1985 was also a peak year for the value ofthe dollar relative to foreign currencies, which tended to increase importpressure. Since 1985, however, the value of the dollar has fallen by about30 percent * * *. This should more than eliminate the price advantage ofimports, and it should generally reduce the level of import penetration.[Ex. 686i, p. 9].</ITAG>The effect of the devaluation of the dollar is apparent when unit valuesfor imports and domestic shipments of chrome yellow are compared for theyears 1985 through 1987. As noted above, the unit value of imports in 1985was 70andCx.11; while that of domestic shipments was 91andCx.11;. In 1987,the two values were practically the same, at 75andCx.11; for imports and75andCx.11;-78andCx.11; for domestic shipments. Additionally, since it is believedthat imports may be undervalued to avoid tariff, foreign producers apparentlyno longer enjoy a price advantage. This evidence, along with the fact thatU.S. producers ship over two times the metric tonnage of chrome yellowthat is consumed here, supports the claim by Heubach that the U.S. chromepigment industry is a net exporter. Demand for these pigments is ``heavily dependent on activity in the automotiveindustry, construction, equipment manufacturing, and the plastics industry''[Ex. 582-17, p. 7]. These industries all experienced substantial cyclicaldecline in the 1982 recession [Ex. 579, p. 9]. At the public hearing, Mr.William M. Arnheim of Heubach, Inc. testified that lead chromates are usedprimarily for road marking, which consumes nearly 20 million pounds oflead chromate yellow each year [Tr., p. 1133]. (Mr. Arnheim also notedthat the ``vast majority of the paints and coatings used in these applicationsare purchased and applied at taxpayers' expense'' [Tr., p. 1134]). Othermajor consumer markets identified were plastics coloring (over 10 millionpounds annually), paints and coatings (about 10 million pounds annually),and inks (5 to 7 million pounds annually) [Tr., pp. 1135-1137].Acceptable substitutes for lead chromate pigments are scarce, but theydo exist and are generally more expensive, up to twenty five times morecostly. One producer of lead chromates reported that its customers arelooking for organic substitutes [Ex. 684h]. Substitutes have been criticizedon appearance and quality [Ex. 582-16]. There do not appear to be substitutesfor lead chromate pigments at any cost for industrial top coatings, trafficpaints, and road markers [Ex. 579, p. 10]. While Meridian reported that demand can probably be expected to erode inthe long run, the information presented above does not suggest a potentialdecline. For one-third of this industry's product, traffic paint, demandis high [582-17]. Further, the limited availability of substitutes andthe use of lead chromates in the construction and automotive industriesindicate continuing demand. Commerce Department (Bureau of the Census) data indicate that the valueof shipments of organic pigments, which are also produced by Heubach andHarshaw/Filtrol and do not contain lead, increased approximately 8 percentin 1986 [1986 Annual Survey of Manufactures, Bureau of the Census, U.S.Department of Commerce]. Prices increased by 3.8 percent that year [ProducerPrice Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, December,1986]. Prices for these products increased approximately 9 percent in 1988[Producer Price Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor,November, 1988]. Financial information was available from Dun andamp; Bradstreet for SIC 2816,the industry code which covers the lead chromate pigment producers [Ex.579, p. 18]. However, Heubach, Inc. noted that statistics for SIC 2816are not necessarily representative of the lead chromate pigments industry,as the lead pigment producers make up only a small portion of the SIC (Mr.William M. Arnheim, representing Heubach, Inc., testified at the informalhearing that ``lead chromates can hardly constitute as much as 2 percentof the pounds or dollars sold under SIC 2816'' [Tr., p. 1133]). Financialinformation offered by Heubach noted that ``for the period 1984 through1986, rates of return on assets and net worth declined by more than 55%''[Ex. 582-16]; however, no specific rates were provided by the company.Harshaw/Filtrol provided profit data at the facility level for the years1984 through 1987 [Ex. 694-5, p. 6]. In each of the last three years forwhich data were available, losses were reportedly sustained by their leadchromate operations. In 1987, losses represented 5.6 percent of lead chromatesales. Losses for 1985 and 1986 were 10.2 percent and 11.0 percent of sales,respectively. While the Harshaw/Filtrol information suggests low or non-existent profitability,OSHA does not believe that these data provide an accurate representationof the current financial condition of this industry. Heubach's declinein profitability from 1984 through 1986 was most likely due to the overvaluationof the dollar, but, as explained above, circumstances have changed. Additionally,while Heubach reported a decline in profitability of 55 percent, no indicationwas given that the firm was not profitable. Harshaw/Filtrol's data alsoindicate poor performance, but substantial improvement is indicated for1987. The information presented above indicates continued demand for theproducts of this sector and domestic product prices which are internationallycompetitive. Since financial data supplied by industry were not adequate to allow OSHAto estimate current rates of profitability for the lead chromate industry,Dun and Bradstreet financial statistics were used to compute economic impacts.<T3>Costs of Compliance.</T3> In developing its cost estimates, OSHA foundthat information supplied by commenters made it possible to project compliancecosts for four of the five plants in the industry. Kikuchi Color andamp;Chemical Corporation should incur no incremental costs due to this regulation[Ex. 476-264]. Detailed annual costs for two facilities Heubach, Inc. andHarshaw/Filtrol (HF), are shown in Table 3. As noted in the table, certainestimates may be overstated due to the effect of dust reduced products.This effect is addressed below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Estimated Costs of Compliance for Plants in the Lead Chromate PigmentsIndustry</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Annualized capital </H1>a<H1>Annual Oandamp;M</H1><H1>Total annual</H1>Heubach <ITAG tagnum="3">Isolation_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Belt dryer </ITAG>b <D>$9,400 </D><D>$0 </D><D>$119,400</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Exhaust_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Belt dryer</ITAG>b <D>2,936 </D><D>2,000 </D><D>4,936</D><ITAG tagnum="2">Bagging b <D>199,550 </D><D>153,000 </D><D>352,550</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Housekeeping <D>1,718 </D><D>14,090 </D><D>15,808</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Annual cleaning<D> </D><D>50,000 </D><D>50,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>213,603 </D><D>219,090 </D><D>432,693</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG>Harshaw-Filtrol <ITAG tagnum="2">Blending b<D> 17,616 </D><D> 12,000 </D><D> 29,616</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Bagging b<D>63,858 </D><D>43,500 </D><D>107,358</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Isol_packaging<D>35,250 </D><D>0 </D><D>35,250 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Baghouses<D>26,424 </D><D>18,000 </D><D>44,424</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Housekeeping<D>1,145 </D><D>9,970 </D><D>11,115</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Annual cleaning <D> </D><D>50,000 </D><D>50,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Central vacuum <D>7,340 </D><D>5,000 </D><D>12,340</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>$151,633 </D><D>$138,470 </D><D>$290,103 </D><F> </F>a Capital costs were annualized using a 10% financing cost anda projected useful life of 12 years.

The Heubach facility hasa total of seven packaging stations. Costs for bagging were estimated basedon isolation and ventilation for five semi-automatic packers and on thepurchase of two fully automated packers. Costs for ventilation and isolationfor these stations were estimated to be $1.2 million ($175,000 each) [Ex.582-16]. Automatic palletizing equipment was also recommended. Evidencein the public record indicates that the cost of such a device would be$25,000 [Ex. 582-17]. Total costs for palletizing equipment for five semi-automaticpackaging stations would be $125,000. Automated packers were also recommended,and OSHA assumes that two such baggers will be implemented at this facility.Costs are estimated to be $85,000 per device, including packer and palletizer.[Ex. 582-17]. Total costs for automated baggers at this facility are thusestimated to be $170,000. Costs for housekeeping equipment were also includedfor this facility (three portable vacuum sweepers at $3,900 each [Ex. 686i,p. 30]. Since the company has expressed its intent to phase out batch operationswithin two years, no costs will be incurred for this portion of their facility[Tr., p. 1187]. Evidence in the public record also indicates that a centralvacuum system is already in place in this facility [Ex. 582-16]. In addition, Heubach identified construction of a containment wall aroundthe belt dryer as an additional control measure to reduce the exposureof the operator below the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL (except during periodicleanout) [Ex. 582-16, p. 21]; in oral testimony, representatives of Heubachdid not identify this as an area where employee exposures are consistentlyabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ [Tr., pp. 1165-1169]. It is not clear from thisinformation whether the belt dryer is contributing to employee exposuresabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\; OSHA has, however, incorporated Heubach's costestimates for this operation into its own cost estimates for this facility.Heubach also provided cost estimates associated with reducing employeeexposures to lead in the continuous centrifuge area of the plant. Heubachsuggested that continuous centrifuges be partitioned from the rest of thework area; however, Heubach also noted that employees in this area are``generally below the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL at this time'' [Ex. 582-16,p. 19]. Because exposure levels are generally in compliance, OSHA has notincluded Heubach's estimated costs for this area in its own compliancecost estimates.In the Harshaw/Filtrol facility, costs will be incurred for blending ($120,000),baghouses dedicated to separate colors ($180,000), and bagging equipment($435,000) [Ex. 582-17]. (Costs for bagging include three local exhaustventilation systems at $60,000 each, three automatic palletizers at $25,000each, and three automated baggers at $60,000 each. Cost estimates for baggingsystems required at the Harshaw/Filtrol facility were based on Ex. 582-17.Costs for housekeeping equipment (two portable vacuum sweepers at $3,900each and a central vacuum system at $50,000) were also estimated. Isolationor partitioning of the packaging area could also be required, and additionalcapital costs would be estimated at $100,000. The cost of regular cleaning (assumed to be done annually) was estimatedto be $50,000 for the large facilities (Heubach and Harshaw/Filtrol) [Ex.694-9]. Annualized capital costs were computed based on a projected useful lifeof twelve years, except in the cases of partitioning and isolation forwhich twenty years was used, and a ten percent financing cost. Operatingand maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses were calculated at ten percent of capitalcosts. Oandamp;M costs for housekeeping include HEPA filter replacement,at $2,000 per sweeper per year, and costs for additional labor, estimatedto be $6,920 for the Heubach facility and $5,190 for Harshaw/Filtrol. (Incrementallabor costs are based on an estimate of 2 person-hours for the Heubachfacility and 1 and one-half person-hours for the Harshaw/Filtrol facility,performed at an average wage of $13.84 over fifty weeks, five days perweek). Additional housekeeping will be particularly useful in removingfrom surfaces pigment released during the cleanout operation. As shown in Table 3, total annual costs for the Heubach facility are estimatedto be $432,693. Harshaw/Filtrol would be expected to incur annual costsof $290,103. As noted in the table, these estimates may not reflect the effect of thedust reduced products used by these firms. Heubach testified that theyexpect to see ``significant reductions in dust exposures during dry pigmenthandling operations, such as blending and packaging'' [Tr., p. 1156]. Inboth facilities, bagging area operations accounted for a significant partof total costs. OSHA estimates that with dust reduced products the costsfor bagging operations would be substantially reduced. For each of thesefirms, these products would most likely eliminate the need for isolationof the packaging areas resulting in an estimated reduction in annual costsof about $95,000 for Heubach and over $35,000 for Harshaw/Filtrol. Thus,annual costs would be expected to be reduced to $340,000 for Heubach and$255,000 for Harshaw/Filtrol. The costs for these two plants were related to the types and quantity ofcertain pigment products and production equipment. In the absence of specificcost or process information pertaining to the remaining plants, OSHA hasassigned costs based on the lead chromate capacity of these plants. Annualcosts for the Heubach facility are equivalent to $12,363 per million poundsof capacity. At Harshaw/Filtrol, annual costs are equivalent to $14,505per million pounds. Averaging these two values yields $13,434 per millionpounds. The production capacities of the remaining plants are estimatedto be 3 million and 1 million pounds. Annual costs for these plants areestimated to be $40,302 (Wayne Pigment) and $13,343 (NL Chemicals), respectively.(Due to economies of scale, this methodology may underestimate costs forsmaller operations somewhat). Total industry annual expenditures are expected to be about $777,000. Thesecosts are exclusive of major process or product modification, such as convertingbatch processing to continuous or semi-continuous processing. Data in thepublic record submitted by Heubach [Ex. 582-16] indicate the magnitudeof such additional costs. Heubach estimated total dryer replacement tocost $1.5 million to $2.0 million. A process conversion as completed byHarshaw/Filtrol [Ex. 476-244] would require at least $5.0 million in capitalresources. Cost data were also reported regarding separate grinding linesdedicated to different product groups [Ex. 475-37]. Costs for this typeof process modification were $4.3 million in 1975. <T3>Economic Feasibility. </T3>The economic impacts of the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\lead standard on the lead chromate pigments industry are summarized inTable 4. Lead related sales for the industry were determined by summing 1987 valueof shipments of chrome yellow, chrome orange, and molybdate chrome orange,and 1984 value of shipments for chrome green (1984 was the last year forwhich the Census Bureau published data for chrome green). [Current IndustrialReport, Inorganic Chemicals (MA28A), Bureau of the Census, U.S. Departmentof Commerce]. Total value of industry shipments ($58 million) were thenapportioned among the five producers (four of which are expected to incurcosts) on the basis of capacity, and are shown in column 1 of the Table.(NL Chemicals was assumed to account for about 1.6 percent of industrycapacity). Percentages of total sales, shown in column 2, were obtainedfrom information supplied during the public hearing [Tr., p. 1132] andwere used to compute the estimates of total corporate sales shown in column3. Total sales for Wayne Pigment were obtained from Dialog InformationServices (Duns Financial Records Plus). Lead related profits appear incolumn 4.

OSHA used conservative estimates;that is, compliance costs were not adjusted for possible reductions dueto dust reduced products. Impacts in columns 7, 8, and 9 are thus overstatedto this extent. Cost to sales ratios for the five firms listed appear in column 7 of Table4 and indicate that price increases of about 1\1/2\ percent will be requiredfor Heubach, Harshaw/Filtrol, and NL Chemical to pass the costs of compliancethrough to customers. Wayne Pigment would require over a 2\1/2\ percentincrease. OSHA believes that pass-through is possible for at least a portionof compliance costs. First, as noted earlier, substitutes for these pigments are scarce andwhen they are available, they are expensive. The largest market for leadchromate pigments is traffic paint, a use for which, as noted above, nosubstitutes exist. This is also a use for which demand is high and whichis produced primarily for public consumption; thus, full cost pass-throughis likely, either in the form of local taxes or other revenue enhancementmechanisms such as municipal bonds [Ex. 582-17, p. 7]. Second, as demonstratedabove, the price competitiveness of U.S. producers in the world markethas improved due to the decline in the U.S. dollar. Import penetration,therefore, is not expected to be a major deterrent to U.S. producers increasingprices. The ability of this industry to pass through at least a portionof compliance costs was indicated by Heubach, as they noted ``it is estimatedthat as little as 25 percent of the cost of meeting the PEL could be passedalong through price increases'' [Ex. 582-16]. Profit impacts appear in columns 8 and 9 of Table 4. (Information in thepublic record does not allow the calculation of corporate profits for NLChemicals; therefore, profit impact on total sales has not been estimated.)It should be noted that the tax-deductibility of compliance costs was takeninto account in computing profit impacts. That is, care was taken to computebefore-tax profit before subtracting annual costs. After subtracting annualcosts, the appropriate average tax rate (34 percent) was then reappliedto determine after-tax profit net of costs. As shown in the table, impacts on lead related profits will range between18.1 and 21.2 percent for all firms except Wayne, for which impacts willbe about 36 percent. The ability of the firms in this industry to absorbthe costs of compliance however, depends not only upon the profitabilityof their lead chromate operations but also on the extent to which theyengage in activities other than the manufacture of lead pigments. OSHAhas computed profit impact ratios with respect to total corporate profitsand these figures are also presented in Table 4. Impacts on total profitsrange from about 6.4 percent for Harshaw/Filtrol to about 10.7 percentfor Wayne. In the case of full absorption (which OSHA believes should not be necessary),ROS for lead chromate operations could dip 0.9 percent for Heubach, from4.9 percent to 4.0 percent, 1.0 percent for Harshaw/Filtrol, 0.9 percentfor NL Chemical, and 1.8 percent for Wayne, for which ROS could drop toabout 3.4 percent. Corporate ROS could dip as much as 0.6 percent, from4.9 percent to 4.3 percent, for Wayne. Based on this analysis, OSHA finds that the impact of this rulemaking actionwill not threaten industry existence or structure. OSHA's reasoning isas follows. First, it is estimated that one of the five domestic producers, KikuchiColor and Chemical, will incur no costs as a result of this rule. Another,NL Chemical, is a corporation in the $50 million asset size class and leadchromate production accounts for only a small proportion of total corporatesales [Ex. 579, p. 16]. It is estimated that this corporation producesless than 2 percent of total industry output. Costs of compliance are projectedto be lowest for this firm, which may absorb into corporate profits allcosts which cannot be passed through. Profit impact calculations for theremaining firms indicate that compliance costs can be absorbed. Second, OSHA has shown that some cost pass through is possible, based onthe large proportion of industry capacity represented by traffic paint,the unavailability of reasonably priced substitutes, and improved marketconditions for U.S. producers. Third, Heubach, with approximately one-half of total industry capacity,has announced that it will be converting exclusively to dust-reduced products.Representatives of the company testified that this product may offer upto an eight-fold reduction in the dusting level of the finished product[Tr., p. 1156]. Similarly, Harshaw/Filtrol has developed a proprietarytreatment to reduce the dust-generating quality of its product [Ex. 684h,p. 3]. As consumer acceptance of dust-reduced products increases, exposuresand, hence, control costs would be expected to be reduced. As noted aboveOSHA's cost estimates and, hence, impacts are believed to be overstated.Finally, OSHA observes that Heubach, Incorporated, purchased its chemicalproduction facility in 1984 [Tr., p. 1138]. Since then, the company hasinvested in both process and product modification [Tr., p. 1187]. The purchaseof this facility during pending regulation indicates investors' confidencein their ability to operate profitably in the pigment market. Thus, with respect to current market structure and demand, OSHA concludesthat the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ standard is economically feasible for the leadpigments industry within a 2\1/2\ year compliance schedule. All of thefour producers expected to incur costs should be able to finance the costsof this rule through a combination of pass-through and absorption.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Leaded Steel </ITAG><T3>Process Description and Sources of Exposure_Overview. </T3>Molten steelis produced in furnaces, poured into ladles, and then cast. The castingcan either be accomplished by a process known as teeming or by continuouscasting. In either case, lead is first added to the product at the castingstage. Thus, unless the furnace has been charged with lead-containing scrap,or unless there is cross contamination from downstream operations, operationsprior to the casting process should involve little or no lead exposure.After casting, the leaded steel is further shaped by rolling and surfacesare conditioned to customer specifications. <T3>Furnace Operations. </T3>In the United States, steel is produced byeither an electric arc furnace or a basic oxygen furnace. When the electricarc furnace is used, steel scrap is charged into the furnace, where itis melted. Iron oxide or oxygen is injected into the molten metal, whichreacts to remove impurities. Flux and alloy materials are added to producethe specified molten steel. Molten steel is poured from the electric arcfurnace into large ladles that transport the steel to the teeming aisle.The addition of lead to make leaded steel takes place at the teeming aisle.Currently, three leaded steel producers use electric arc furnaces. When the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) is used, molten iron, which is producedin a blast furnace, is charged into the BOF. Oxygen is blown into the BOFthrough a lance to remove excess carbon. Then flux (limestone) is added,which reacts to remove impurities. The injection of oxygen into the moltenmetal continues until the desired degree of purification is achieved. Withthe addition of alloying elements, molten steel is produced. The steelis poured from the BOF into large ladles that transport the steel to theteeming aisle, where lead is added in leaded steel production. Currently,two steel manufacturers use the basic oxygen process. <T3>Teeming. </T3>After the molten metal is tapped into the ladle, theladle is then carried by an overhead crane to a platform, where the moltensteel is poured into ingot molds, a process known as teeming. Railroadcars adjacent to the teeming platform are used to bring ingot molds tothe teeming area. A typical ingot mold has a capacity of 5 to 10 tons,and a typical heat produces enough molten steel to fill 15 to 40 molds(Ex. 582-87, p. 6). The teeming process can be done by top pouring or bottom pouring of moltensteel into the ingot molds. The top pouring process aligns the ladle overeach individual mold and fills the mold with a controlled stream of steelfrom the bottom of the ladle. The bottom pouring process involves aligningthe ladle over a refractory lined cast iron funnel, which is connectedto the bottom of a series of molds with refractory tubes. The steel isthen teemed into the funnel with a controlled stream which fills the completeseries of connected molds at the same time (Ex. 582-87, p. 6). In the production of leaded steel, lead is added during the teeming process.During top pour teeming, workers add lead into the top of the ingot moldas molten steel is poured, either by placing bags filled with lead shotor by pneumatic injection of lead shot using a lead gun comprised of arubber hose and long steel pipe with a nozzle (Exs. 582-87, p. 8; 620X).During bottom pour teeming, lead shot is added to the stream of moltensteel poured into the centrally located funnel. The process of adding leadlasts between 5 and 60 minutes, depending upon the size of the ingot, thelead content, and the number of ingot molds being filled. The quantityof lead added to each ingot mold varies between 40 and 110 pounds (Ex.582-87, p. 8). In the process of adding lead to the molten steel, the temperature of whichis 2685anddegrees; to 2750anddegrees; F, a substantial quantity of lead isvolatilized. According to AISI, the amount of lead loss per ingot due tofuming ranges from 5-35 pounds (Ex. 582-87). The volatilization of leadcontributes significantly to the amount of airborne lead in the plant.Employees who work on or around the teeming platform experience high exposuresto lead. They include workers who supervise the addition of lead to theingot molds; workers who add lead to the molds with a pneumatic gun orby placing bags of lead shot into the molds; workers who operate or maintainthe teeming ladle and ingot molds; workers who pour molten steel from theladle into the ingot molds; and workers who monitor the addition of leadto ensure that the leaded steel has the appropriate metallurgical properties.<T3>Stripping and Soaking. </T3>After the steel is solidified in the moldsat the platform, which takes two to three hours, the railroad cars aremoved to a stripper area where ingots are removed from the molds by gianttongs. Usually while still hot, the ingots are then charged into soakingpits, which are large, gas-fired, refractory-lined, covered furnaces usedto heat the ingots up to approximately 2400anddegrees; F, the temperaturerequired for rolling steel (Ex. 582-87, p. 7). Because of the automation in this process, there appears to be little orno lead exposure for the employees. <T3>Rolling Operations_Primary Mills and Bar Mills. </T3>The heated ingotsare then removed from the soaking pits and sent to the primary rollingmills or roughing mills to be rolled into semifinished forms of steel suchas: blooms (which are roughly square in cross-section); slabs (which arerectangular); and billets (which have smaller cross-section areas thanblooms but are usually much longer) (Ex. 582-87, p. 7). Companies typically begin the rolling cycle by rolling the largest sizesof steel products first, and then continue rolling sequentially smallersizes of products until the smallest size is rolled. The cycle then beginsanew. Leaded steel is rolled according to where its size fits in the cycle.Accordingly, rolling operations only produce intermittent employee exposuresto lead. In the primary mills, ingots are rolled into blooms which are then rolledinto billets. Before reaching the bar mills where billets are rolled intofinal product, the steel is transferred to a reheat furnace and heatedto proper rolling temperature. Depending on the final product dimensions,the steel is then rolled on bar mills of various sizes, ranging from 8-inchto 24-inch mills. Employees who are potentially exposed to airborne lead during rolling operationsinclude workers who operate the rolling mills, workers who assist the milloperators by adjusting the rolls and mill stands, workers who gauge leadedbars during bar mill operations for the precise dimensions required, workerswho transport leaded steel between mill stands, and workers who chain barsto cranes so that the bars may be moved (Ex. 582-87, p. 15). <T3>Surface Conditioning/Finishing. </T3>Following primary rolling or barmill operations, leaded steel may be sent through surface conditioningor finishing operations. The conditioning removes any surface defects thatmight affect the final product. Conditioning can be accomplished by grindingor scarfing out the defects in the rolled steel. Grinding is performedby large, high speed, automatic grinding machines or manually by spot grinding.The scarfing process, which can be done automatically or manually, involvesburning off surface imperfections with an oxy-fuel torch (Ex. 582-87).Most surface conditioning is performed on billets, most often by grindingthe surface with a grinding machine. Hand scarfing is required in certainlimited circumstances to satisfy customer requirements and results in highlead levels when scarfing leaded steel. To meet certain quality standards,it may be necessary to have several rolling and conditioning steps beforethe steel is rolled into a finished product. Employees are potentiallyexposed to lead when performing surface conditioning on leaded steel products.<T3>Continuous (Strand) Casting. </T3>There are several kinds of continuous(strand) casting machines used in steel production, such as slab, billet,or bloom casters. The kind of caster relevant to leaded steel productionis a bloom caster. Currently one company is using this continuous castingmethod instead of the traditional teeming process to produce leaded steel(Ex. 694-41, p. 12). In continuous casters, molten steel is poured from a ladle into a tundish,which is likened to the large open portion of a funnel. The stem portionof the funnel is the mold and its cross-sectional shape determines thetype of product or continuous strand the caster can produce; i.e., squareto produce blooms or rectangular to produce a slab. The bloom caster usedto produce leaded steel has two strands, each of which produces a continuousstrand of steel having the cross-sectional geometry of a bloom. Lead isadded to the molten steel in the tundish. Fume can evolve from its surfacewhen lead is added (Ex. 694-41). The area from which fume is emitted ismuch larger than the open surface area of an ingot mold on a teeming platform,and if not properly ventilated, can present a major source of employeeexposure to lead. The molten metal is cooled and shaped as it is movedby rollers during the forming of the strand. Each strand can be severalhundred feet long. At the end of the casting process, each strand of solidifiedsteel is cut with a torch into the desired lengths to be reheated in furnacesand sent to a primary rolling operation. After primary rolling, the castbloom is further processed in bar rolling mills and surface conditioningareas as needed. The ends of the strand and samples of the continuouslycast steel are also cut with a torch. The burning of leaded steel witha torch generates lead fume and creates another source of exposure to theoperator as well as the employees nearby (Ex. 694-41, p. 15). <T3>Other Operations_Scrap Handling and Maintenance. </T3>Other areas ofexposures to lead can be found in scrap operations and in the maintenanceof baghouses. In scrap operations, scrap may be cut as well as stored (e.g.,cobbles are cut with torches or hydraulic cutters). Whether done indoorsor outdoors, all forms of cutting or burning leaded steel result in significantlead exposures. The extent of exposure depends in part on the amount oflead in the scrap metal. Maintenance personnel are subject to intermittentbut high levels of airborne lead, especially in operations such as cleaningout baghouses. Additionally, crane and ground mobile equipment operators working in theteeming area, the furnace area, the rolling mills, and in surface conditioningareas may also be exposed to high air lead levels.<T3>Existing Exposure Levels</T3>. There are approximately 2,000 employeesworking in the production of leaded steel who are exposed to lead (Tr.935). Of these, approximately 75% are only occasionally exposed to leadabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and generally have average exposure levels wellbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 681, p. 16). Thus, an estimated 495 employeesare routinely exposed to air lead levels exceeding 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Thisconstitutes 25% of the lead-exposed employees in leaded steel and lessthan one-half of 1% of all production employees in the steel industry.Moreover, based on the best available evidence, exposure levels can be,and in at least one plant are controlled to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ mostof the time in every operation (see discussion below of LTV data). In theoperation that appears most difficult to control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, thepouring of leaded steel, conventional controls in teeming or continuouscasting appear to be capable of controlling exposures to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.OSHA's analysis of the feasibility of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is basedprimarily on the raw exposure level data submitted to the docket by LTV,one of the five leaded steel producers and a member of the American Ironand Steel Institute (AISI), the industry trade association. For severalreasons, OSHA has determined that these data (Ex. 688a) are the best availableevidence of existing exposure levels and of the feasibility of achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. First, all of the sampling at LTV was carried out when leaded steel wasbeing produced. Second, LTV, alone among all leaded steel producers, suppliedOSHA with individual sampling results of recent air lead monitoring, whichenabled OSHA to make its own evaluation of the data. Third, again aloneamong all leaded steel producers, LTV supplied OSHA with annotations explainingcertain sampling results, enabling OSHA to better evaluate the meaningof the raw data. Fourth, LTV's data are very current, covering 1984-1988.Fifth, since the ultimate issue in this rulemaking involves the technologicalfeasibility of achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, the strongest evidencefor such feasibility is that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ already is being achieved.Sixth, an LTV representative testified that his facility is typical insize and nature of operation to the other plants that produce leaded steel(Tr. 893). Finally, as suggested above, all of the data submitted by othersources are significantly less complete, useful and useable. For example, AISI, which submitted two overlapping sets of data to therecord, failed to provide OSHA with recent, individual sampling results,a description of associated control technologies, or any explanation ofpotentially aberrant sampling results. Indeed, until its second submissionof data late in the rulemaking, AISI's sole submission of data incorporatedonly ranges of exposure levels in various job categories without any indicationof the frequency of various distributions (Ex. 673, p. 3). Unfortunately,it is hardly useful for OSHA to know only that among steel pourers exposuresranged from 1-1,038 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or that among scarfers the range was1-784 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Such data do not provide an adequate picture of typicalexposure levels or provide any sense of the efficacy of existing controls.Moreover, AISI's data are not organized plant by plant and therefore arenot amenable to serious analysis for purposes of determining feasibility.Similarly, OSHA cannot ascertain from such submissions why a particularresult at some unidentified plant was as low as 1 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or whyanother was as high as 784 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Thus, OSHA cannot determine ifa sampling result of 1 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is due to the existence of sophisticatedcontrols in a particular plant or simply represents a sample collectedwhen leaded steel was not being produced. OSHA cannot derive meaningfulconclusions from such exposure data. AISI's second submission of data (Ex. 694-41, p. 24) is more substantialthan its first but is still of only limited use. This submission includesadditional aggregate data on the frequency distribution of samples withincertain ranges of exposure levels. However, the data are not broken downplant by plant; nor are the associated control measures described. As aresult, OSHA still cannot determine what controls in a particular plantare associated with what exposure levels. In addition, the job titles used in the earlier submission are absent inthis submission. In each work area listed, exposure levels from many jobsapparently are mixed together (e.g., supervisors, crane operators, etc.)Consequently, OSHA also cannot ascertain the exposure levels for employeesperforming particular operations Thus, for example, where AISI data indicatethat 47 out of the 103 samples in teeming are over 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHAcannot determine whether these results represent crane operators, leadmenwho manually add bags of lead shot to molten steel, or other workers. Similarly,OSHA cannot ascertain how sampling results said to be within a specifiedrange are distributed within that range. Thus, for example, where AISIdata indicate that 107 samples are in the 50-99 andCx.18;g/m\3\ range, OSHAcannot determine whether some, many or even all may be close to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.OSHA therefore has concluded that little meaningful analysis can be madeof AISI's second submission of data. The failure to submit detailed data restricts OSHA's analysis. OSHA explicitlyrequested disaggregated information and data in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice announcing the 1987 hearing in this rulemaking(52 FR 28727; August 3, 1987). OSHA reiterated the request during the publichearing (Tr. 1040-42). Nevertheless, AISI and, with one exception, theindustry as a whole did not provide OSHA with such data and information.Similarly, AISI declined to arrange site visits for OSHA after the Novemberhearing. Finally, the exposure levels summarily reported by AISI for 1986-87 arehigher than exposure levels reported for 1977-81 (Exs. 489, H-004E; 553-6,p. 1-5). This is contrary to the lower levels that would be expected inrecent years, because 8 to 12 years ago production levels were substantiallyhigher and serious modernization of the steel plants had not yet begun(Ex. 578, p. 14). In this context, the Agency cannot accept at face valueAISI's contentions and its incomplete, aggregated and unexplained data.Consequently, OSHA agrees with Meridian's assessment that LTV data arethe best and most detailed evidence of exposure levels in the record. TheAgency therefore has relied primarily on the raw data submitted by LTV(Ex 688a).Those data have been summarized on the record by Meridian (Ex. 686H, p.12; see Table 2, below) and by AISI (Ex. 694-41, p. 20; see Table 1, below).OSHA has also independently analyzed the raw data. OSHA's analyses of theraw data and the two summaries all show that LTV is able to achieve exposurelevels at or below 50 mg/m\3\ in all, or nearly all of its operations.Although AISI has made much of an alleged distortion of the raw data inMeridian's summary, OSHA sees no significant difference in the import ofthe two summaries. Nonetheless, OSHA will rely upon industry's summary.According to AISI's summary, 81% of all the sampling results are below50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 694-41, p. 20; see Table 1, below). In addition, 66% arebelow the action level (30 mg/m\3\), while 93% are below 100 mg/m\3\. Inall but one operation, the scrapyard, approximately two-thirds or moreof the sampling results are below 50 mg/m\3\. In the scrapyard, which AISIhas not identified as a problem area for the industry (Tr. 941-42), thereare only two sampling results. One is below 30 mg/m\3\ and the other isbetween 50 mg/m\3\ and 74 mg/m\3\. In only two operations are any samplingresults above 100 mg/m\3\. In one of these two, crane operators, only twoof 19 results are above 100 mg/m\3\. One is 101 mg/m\3\ and the other is215 mg/m\3\. However, LTV s annotation to the monitoring results indicatesthat the crane cab's windows were opened during pouring, when that secondsample was taken (Ex. 688a).AISI identifies three operations as problem areas for the industry_teeming,rolling and conditioning (Exs. 582-87, pp. 8-16; 681, pp. 6-15). In twoof these operations, rolling and conditioning, 90% or more of the samplingresults at LTV are less than 50 mg/m\3\ (see table 1, below). Moreover,in these two, all results are below 100 mg/m\3\ which suggests that highexposure levels have been eliminated by effective controls. In pouring,the third problem area identified by AISI, 65% of all sampling resultsare less than 50 mg/m\3\ and only 21% are at or above 75 mg/m\3\. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s100,6,6,6,6,6,6</C><T4> Table </T4>1._<T4>AISI Submission of Revised Summary of LTV Data (Ex. </T4>694-41)<H1>Work area</H1><H1>N</H1><H1>andless;30</H1><H1>30-49</H1><H1>50-74</H1><H1>75-99</H1><H1>andgreater;99</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Scrap yard<D>2</D><D>1</D><D>0</D><D>1</D><D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pouring<D>38</D><D>9</D><D>16</D><D>5</D><D>1</D><D>7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rolling<D>47</D><D>44</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>3</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conditioning<D>21</D><D>17</D><D>2</D><D>2</D><D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crane oper.<D>19</D><D>13</D><D>1</D><D>2</D><D>1</D><D>2</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>127</D><D>84</D><D>19</D><D>10</D><D>5</D><D>9</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s100,6,6,6,6,6,6</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Meridian Summary of LTV Data \1\ (Ex. 686H)</T4><H1>Work area </H1><H1>N </H1><H1>andless;30 </H1><H1>30-50 </H1><H1>50-75 </H1><H1>75-100 </H1><H1>andgreater;100</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Scrap yard<D>2</D><D>1</D><D>1</D><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pouring<D>14</D><D>9</D><D>2</D><D/><D/><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rolling<D>13</D><D>11</D><D/><D/><D>2</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conditioning<D>5</D><D>3</D><D>1</D><D>1</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crane Operator<D>9</D><D>5</D><D/><D>2</D><D>1</D><D>1</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">   Total<D>43</D><D>29</D><D>4</D><D>3</D><D>3</D><D>4</D><F>\1\ Meridian's summary covers only 1987-88 exposure data and only datafor employees working heats that were specifically labeled as leaded.</F></ITAG></ITAG>OSHA's own analysis of LTV's 1987-88 raw monitoring data confirms the conclusionsdrawn from the summaries above. This is most clearly demonstrated by focusingon the entire pouring operation, which is considered to be among the mostdifficult to control.The average of all monitoring results in pouring at LTV in 1987-88 is 109mg/m\3\ (see Table 3, below). However, within pouring there are five jobclassifications of employees who perform quite different tasks and experiencedifferent exposures to lead. These are: crane operator, pourer, moldman,metal observer, and recorder, Broken down into component job classifications,exposure levels for various categories of employees in the pouring operationlook quite different from the overall average. For example, average exposuresfor moldman, metal observer and recorder are all below 40 mg/m\3\. Thecrane operator's average is 60 mg/m\3\. Only the average of pourers, whoare generally considered to be among the employees who are exposed to thehighest lead exposures, is higher than 60 mg/m\3\, at 179 mg/m\3\.However, in the case of both the crane operator and the pourer these averagesare greatly increased by what appear to be atypical events occurring onone particular day. For the crane operater, only one of seven monitoringresults is above 67 mg/m\3\. That result, 215 mg/m\3\, was recorded ona day when, LTV notes, the crane cab's windows were left open during mostof the sampling time. If that single result is not counted, the crane operator'saverage exposure level would drop from 60 mg/m\3\ to 35mg/m\3\. Even includingthis single high data point, the geometric mean exposure level for craneoperators is 40 mg/m\3\.Similarly, for the pourer, 10 of 13 monitoring results are below 40 mg/m\3\.The three exposure readings above 40 mg/m\3\ (309, 910, and 922 mg/m\3\)were all obtained on one day, apparently during one shift. Because thesehigh levels were experienced at the same time and are atypical of mostother exposure measurements obtained for this job category, OSHA assumessome unusual condition, like an upset, must have existed. If those resultsare not counted, the pourer's average exposure level is 20 mg/m\3\. Inany event, even including the three high data points, the geometric meanfor pourers is 40 mg/m\3\.Looking at the LTV data for the entire pouring operation from a differentperspective, 78% of all sampling results in 1987-88 from that operationare below 50 mg/m\3\. In the job classification of pourer, 77% of the samplingresults are below 50 mg/m\3\. All other operations in the production ofleaded steel are generally considered to be easier to control than pouring.OSHA therefore concludes that air lead levels at or below 50 mg/m\3\, arebeing achieved most of the time in all operations at LTV. This conclusionis supported by AISI's and Meridian's independent summaries of the data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>OSHA's Summary of Exposure Data for Pouring at LTV, </T4>1987-88 <H1>Job classification </H1><H1>No. of samples </H1><H1>Arithmetic mean</H1><H1>Geometric mean </H1><H1>Distribution of exposure data </H1><H2>andless;50 </H2><H2>andless;75</H2><H2>andless;100 </H2><H2>andless;200</H2><H2>200</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Pourer <D>13</D><D>179</D><D>40</D><D>10 (77%)</D><D>10 (77%)</D><D>10 (77%)</D><D>10 (77%)</D><D>3 (23%)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crane Operator <D>7</D><D>60</D><D>40</D><D>4 (57%)</D><D>6 (86%)</D><D>6 (86%)</D><D>6 (86%)</D><D>1 (14%) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Moldman <D>3</D><D>38</D><D/><D>3 (100%)</D><D>3 (100%)</D><D>3 (100%) </D><D>3 (110%</D><D>0 ( 0%)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Met.

A, p. 9). AISI contends thatexposures in continuous casting ``remain above 100 andCx.18;g/m3'' (Ex. 673,p. 5). However, data submitted by AISI for that one producer contradictAISI's assertion and show that a majority of 59 sampling results for continuouscasting are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m3 and 93% of the result are at orbelow 100 andCx.18;g/m3 (Ex. 694-41, p. 16). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Lead Concentration Frequency Distribution for Continuous Casting, 1987-88</T4><H1>N </H1><H1>andless;50 </H1><H1>andless;100 </H1><H1>andless;200 </H1><H1>andgreater;200</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">59 <D>31 (53%) </D><D>55 (93%) </D><D>57 (97%) </D><D>2 (3%) </D><F>Source: Submitted by AISI (Ex. 694-41)</F></ITAG></ITAG> Data submitted by LTV concerning exposure levels during LTV's experimentswith continuous casting also contradict AISI's contention; each of sevensampling results taken during that operation were below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.(Ex. 688a). There are two other data sets from earlier years in the record that OSHAfinds consistent with the Agency's analysis of exposure levels. These datasets were submitted by a former OSHA contractor, JACA (Ex. 553-6, p. 1-5),and the United Steelworkers (USWA) for the years from 1977-81 (Exs. 489,H-004E; 578, p. 9). Both indicate exposure levels lower than AISI's 1986-87data. In the case of USWA's submission involving exposure levels at RepublicSteel's Buffalo plant between 1979-80, a majority of sampling results in6 of 8 operations were even then at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In one ofthe two operations (crane operator) with sampling results over 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,there is only a single monitoring result, 61 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In the otheroperation over 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ the average exposure level is 86 andCx.18;g/m\3\and no result is over 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 578, p. 9). With regard to the JACA report, which is based on data provided by AISIfor 1977-81, 44% of the sampling results at that time were below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 553-6, p. 1-5). However, AISI now reports that in 1986-87 only 38%of the sampling results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 694-41, p. 21).AISI offers no explanation of why worker exposure levels are rising asproduction is falling and the industry is modernizing. OSHA questions whetherexposure levels should be increasing under such conditions. AISI's dataare also inconsistent with the exposure data from LTV, which show the vastmajority of exposure samples are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. <T3>Existing Controls. </T3>In leaded steel production, local and generalventilation constitute the primary method for controlling air lead levels.In addition, filtered-air work stations and cabs regularly are used. Inthe three work areas that AISI has identified as problem areas, teeming,rolling, and conditioning, current controls are as follows: <T3>Teeming. </T3>Leaded steel is poured on a teeming platform where localexhaust systems of different designs capture and exhaust the lead fumesgenerated after lead shot is added to the molten steel (Ex. 582-87, Att.A, p. 6). Generally, each ventilation system utilizes side-draft hoodsor shrouds to capture the lead fume emitted during teeming. Exposure levelsat the ingot molds and feed trumpet are controlled by side-draft hoods,which are part of a mobile exhaust system that is connected to the centralteeming aisle fume collection system. Air volumes moved by ventilationsystems vary among the five producers; evacuation rates at the teeminghoods vary from 5,000-55,000 cfm (Ex. 582-87, Att. A, p. 6). Teeming employees manipulate the hoods and isolation dampers to providefor the removal of lead fume when the ingot mold is being filled. Appropriatework practices are essential to reduce exposure levels, as the productionemployee plays an important role in controlling the fume collection system(Ex. 681, pp. 8 9). All five producers of leaded steel use various administrative controls,which they claim has limited the number of employees exposed to lead inteeming. For example, each producer has concentrated leaded steelmakingoperations into a single facility and restricted teeming of leaded steelto a single aisle, where ventilation control systems are installed (Tr.1019, 1031; Ex. 681, p. 10). OSHA believes that this consolidation, whichmay have improved productivity, probably has increased exposure levelsfor the particular employees involved in teeming leaded steel and therebymade it more difficult to control exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\for those employees. <T3>Rolling. </T3>When ingots are heated prior to rolling, the doors tothe soaking pits are opened and closed by remote control from inside anair conditioned crane cab or by operators located in air-conditioned orventilated control pulpits. The potential for employee exposure to leadfumes is substantially decreased due to the isolation of the employee fromlead fumes (Ex. 582-87, Att. A, p. 9). Exposures in primary rolling mills are reportedly lower than in bar millsbecause smaller surface areas of steel are exposed to heat and becauseemployees are stationed farther away from the product (Ex. 582-87, p. 15).Operators of the mill generally work in booths (Tr. 901). Some specifictasks must be performed outside the booths; e.g., cleanup, maintenance,and crane helper. No methods of lead dust suppression are used at the primaryrolling mills at any of the five facilities, according to Middough (Ex.582-87, Att. A, p. 10). Although Middough in broad strokes seems to dismissthe possibility of controlling lead exposures in these mills. Meridianand OSHA are not persuaded that the nature of the process necessarily precludesimplementing such controls as isolation and local exhaust to deal withspecific emission sources. Other controls also may be appropriate. Forexample, the majority of bar mills `` * * * use water to cool the millrolls and provide for the suppression of lead dust. The water is sprayedor directed at the exit end of the mill stands'' (Ex. 582-87, Att. A, p.11). <T3>Surface Finishing/Conditioning. </T3>Surface conditioning generallyis performed by semi-automated grinding and scarfing machines that housethe operator in an enclosed air-conditioned cab. The dust and fumes arecollected in a combination evacuation hood/drop out box, with the evacuationcapacity of the hoods ranging as high as 30,000 cfm. All five facilitieshave grinding stations. One of the five facilities still uses an oldergrinding station that has an open cab (582-87, Att. A, p.13). Occasionallychipping, grinding, and scarfing are done by hand to meet customer specifications(Ex. 582-87, p. 16). These operations are likely to result in exposuresover 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. But crews are reported to be rotated to administrativelycontrol employee exposures (Tr. 1027).<T3>Additional Controls. </T3>OSHA's analysis of the record in a previoussection indicates that engineering and work practice controls that arecurrently available and in use already have achieved air lead levels inat least one plant that are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of the timein every operation (see Tables 1 and 2, above). More generally, acrossthe industry, 75% of the steel employees exposed to lead are only occasionallyexposed above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and generally have averages well below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 681, p. 16; Tr. 935). OSHA believes that these exposuredata alone are sufficient to demonstrate that the industry can reasonablybe expected to achieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL most of the time duringall leaded steel operations. Nevertheless, as the following discussionshows, industry has not yet exhausted all of the opportunities availablefor improving its existing engineering and work practice controls. Thiswas generally acknowledged by one representative of LTV, who testifiedthat his company has adopted a ``philosophy of continuous improvement''in worker health and safety (Tr. 1027-28). OSHA believes that for most operations in the industry few, if any, additionalcontrols are needed. Nevertheless, in the three problem operations identifiedby AISI, implementation of additional controls may be necessary at certainplants to control exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Such controlsare readily available. OSHA believes that the additional engineering controls needed to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the problem operations and in any other operation thatneeds some reduction in exposure levels consist primarily of improvementin existing ventilation systems, isolation and enclosure of workers, anduse of remote controls. Improvements in engineering controls should bepart of a system of integrated controls. Implementation of strict workpractices, administrative controls and a good housekeeping program alsoare necessary. Proper maintenance of ventilation equipment is essentialto assure the effective functioning of exhaust systems needed to achievethe intended reduction in worker exposure to lead. Two of the simplest improvements to engineering controls are to provideall mobile equipment operators with completely enclosed cabs equipped withhigh efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and tempered air and toprovide communication equipment. Communication equipment such as two-wayradios should be provided to allow communication without opening cab windows;otherwise, the purpose of the ventilated enclosed cabs will be defeated.Both of these control technologies are readily available and in use insome plants in the steel industry and elsewhere (Ex. 604). In its testimony and videotape, AISI acknowledges that some crane cabsare not enclosed and not provided with HEPA filters (Tr 965-66, 1043);Middough also observed that crane cabs in the steel industry are not ventilatedor air conditioned (Ex. 582-87, p. 7). If such enclosures are accompaniedby an integrated system of controls to assure that good work and maintenancepractices are followed in the use of the cabs, the data confirm that enclosingcabs can substantially reduce exposure levels.LTV's data, for example, show that one crane operator in the pouring areahad an exposure of 215 andCx.18;g/m\3\ when the cab windows were open duringmost of the sampling time while another crane operator on the same shifthad an exposure of 56 andCx.18;g/m\3\ with the cab windows closed duringpouring, representing a 74% reduction in exposure due to cab enclosureand good work practices (Ex. 688a). OSHA does not know whether this craneoperator was provided with communication equipment or whether the operatorhad to open the window for a time to communicate. AISI testified that useof filtered-air cabs, in conjunction with good work practices and communicationequipment, will reduce exposures to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, except in unusualor emergency situations (Tr. 1047). Employees working in the teeming, rolling, and even surface conditioningareas also can be isolated from lead dust and fumes in enclosed air-conditioned,filtered booths and pulpits. Use of a pulpit by an employee even for 25%of a shift has been shown to significantly reduce employee exposure tolead (Ex. 590, p. 40). Thus, OSHA believes that the exposure of employeeswho must work in close proximity to emission sources can be reduced ifthe employee can spend at least some time in a filtered booth or pulpit.Improvement in the collection efficiency of existing ventilation systemscan be achieved by increasing the volume of air exhausted and the capturevelocity. The efficiency of the exhaust system in certain operations liketeeming often can be increased simply by the installation of barriers toreduce unpredictable air currents that disrupt local ventilation. A representativeof Middough testified that the construction of such barriers was possible(Tr. 983-85). OSHA is aware that, because of the safety hazards involvedin the pouring of steel, employees need to be able to exit the platformquickly in an emergency (Tr. 1094-95). However, OSHA also believes thatuse of such barriers in a manner that does not interfere with employeeegress is an approach to reduce lead exposures that merits further exploration.Cross drafts can easily occur in steelmaking facilities, which typicallyare housed in very large, open-ended buildings to allow for railroad traffic.Because of the large openings in the ends of the building and the constanttraffic, these facilities are vulnerable to wind currents that can dispersecontaminants that are not controlled at their sources to other parts ofthe building. OSHA does not recommend reliance on uncontrollable naturalventilation to reduce employee exposures. Cross drafts not only reduce the efficiency of local exhaust ventilationbut they also in some cases can cause cross contamination. OSHA believesthat cross contamination may be a problem in some plants in the leadedsteel industry. According to recent AISI submissions, background levelsare generally in the range of 6-10 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 681, p. 33; Tr. 937-38),and those levels reflect ambient lead levels in the general environment.OSHA considers a background level that contributes up to 20% of a 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL rather high and believes it is caused by cross contamination more thanby ambient environmental levels. OSHA believes that cross contaminationshould be minimized by controlling emissions at their source. For example,the potential for cross contamination from teeming can be minimized, wherepracticable, by promptly covering ingot molds filled with fuming, moltenleaded steel. Engineering controls often can only be as effective as the work practicesassociated with them. Therefore good work practices are crucial to controlexposure levels. For example, according to Middough, the efficient operationof the teeming exhaust system requires workers to open and close dampersas necessary (Ex. 582-87, Att. A). Inappropriate work practices could reducethe effectiveness of the system, because ``too many open hoods ahead ofthe ingot poured reduces the rate of air flow through each hood and decreasesthe effectiveness of the hoods located at the sources of the fumes'' (Ex.602, p. 66). OSHA believes there is considerable room for further improvement in workpractices. According to one LTV spokesperson, for example, his facilityhas not, and never will exhaust the potential for improving work practices(Tr. 1028-29). Administrative controls, which are a form of work practice controls, suchas dispersed scheduling of pouring leaded heats and of rolling leaded alloys,also may need to be implemented to achieve reduced exposure levels forindividual workers in teeming. For example, current practice in the industryis to pour no more than an average of two leaded heats per shift, witheach heat producing 15 to 40 molds (Ex. 582-87, pp. 6, 8). In instanceswhere a large number of molds or more than two heats are to be poured ona single shift, dispersing the heats across shifts or different teemingaisles should reduce emissions and resulting exposure levels by as muchas 50% in teeming. Then, for example, the geometric mean exposure levelfor pourers at LTV, the task in teeming with the highest exposure level,would presumably be reduced from 40 andCx.18;g/m\3\ to approximately 20 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Good housekeeping practices and preventive maintenance also are importantcomponents of the system of integrated controls necessary to maintain exposurelevels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ throughout the industry. Indeed, arepresentative of USWA has testified that the equipment now in place, ifproperly maintained, could significantly reduce existing exposure levels.USWA indicates that in many cases where ventilation is in place, maintenanceof the equipment is badly neglected (Tr. 1123-24). Similarly, with regard to implementing a good housekeeping program, regularlycleaning work areas to keep surfaces as free of lead dust as is practicable,for example, will help to achieve and maintain low background levels andfacilitate controlling exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Vacuumsequipped with high efficiency filters can be used, for example, to cleanequipment surfaces prior to maintenance (Tr. 1126). More specifically, for each of the problem areas described by industry_teeming,rolling, and surface conditioning_OSHA has determined that the additionalcontrols necessary to achieve exposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\are readily available.<T3>Teeming. </T3>Teeming is the most difficult operation to control toor below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, according to AISI. Within the teeming process,the operation that creates the highest exposures involves the additionof lead to the molten steel being cast. Exposure levels in teeming canbe controlled down to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ using various methods,singly or in combination. These include adding lead shot by remote control,increasing the capture velocity of existing ventilation systems and changingthe point at which lead is added to the molten metal. As an alternativeto effectively controlling teeming, teeming itself can be replaced by continuouscasting. As indicated previously, currently some leaded steel producers still addlead by manually dropping canvas bags of lead shot into the molten steel.This is the major source of employees' excessive exposure. Other producersrely on a remote controlled injection gun to add the lead by pneumaticor injection feed (Ex. 582-87, p. 5). OSHA is certain that adding leadby remote control significantly reduces employees' exposure, since remotecontrols allow workers to work farther away from the source of the leadfumes and to be stationed in ventilated enclosures. In addition, OSHA believes that in many instances a substantial increasein the collection efficiency of existing ventilation systems can be achievedthrough better design and proper maintenance. Collection efficiency canbe increased, for example, by increasing capture velocity. The industry has tried a number of experiments in which fume hood designwas modified in an effort to increase capture velocity. These attemptshave often resulted in fires within the ductwork, caused by molten sparksbeing drawn into the system (Ex. 673, Att. 1, 2, 3; Tr. 968). However,industry also acknowledges that they have not investigated the potentialincrease in capture efficiency that might be gained by increasing air flow(cfm) through the system rather than redesign of the hoods (Tr. 969-70).OSHA notes that industry is currently using a wide range of airflow ratesin teeming hoods (5,000-55,000 cfm; see Ex. 582-87, Att. A, p. 7), andbelieves that at least some facilities will realize lower employee exposuresto lead as a result of increasing airflow rates through the teeming hoods.To the extent concern remains about the potential for fire due to sparksfrom the molten metal being drawn into the ventilation system, the systemcan be lined with refractory material to prevent accidental ignition. Theserefractory liners have been successfully used elsewhere in systems subjectedto high temperatures (Ex. 689-4D). OSHA further recommends the use of additional traveling local exhaust systems,which provide ventilation through a system of interconnecting flexibleexhaust hoses and multiple hoods that can be maneuvered in the teemingarea. Such a system has proven effective in reducing exposures in smelters(Ex. 604). Adding lead directly to the ladle instead of to the mold or stream of moltenmetal is another means to reduce exposure levels in the teeming operation.Ventilation systems are available that can be modified to effectively exhaustthe ladle (Ex. 631). OSHA is aware that this method has been used successfullyin Japan and Europe (Ex. 633, p. 2). AISI has implicitly acknowledged thetechnological feasibility of using this technology for controlling workers'exposures (Ex. 681, p. 6). An alternative process control method is the use of continuous castinginstead of teeming. Available data demonstrate that air lead levels ator below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ have been achieved most of the time in plantsthat use, or have experimented with continuous casting of leaded steel(Exs. 688a, 694-41, p. 16). Since continuous casting bypasses teeming,stripping, etc., and since the strand of leaded steel is cooled continuouslywith water spray, employees are inherently less exposed to lead fumes dueto the nature of the process. For employees who are exposed when the strandis torch cut, local exhaust systems can be used to reduce employees' exposurelevels. OSHA realizes that continuous casting cannot replace teeming in all casesof leaded steel production. However, a quantity of leaded steel alreadyis being successfully produced in the United States using this technology.OSHA agrees with Meridian's independent judgment that the additional availabilityof continuous casting capacity for casting leaded steel will depend uponthe extent of further modernization by the steel industry, which has beenshifting to the continuous casting of steel in general (Ex. 686H, p. 14).<T3>Rolling. </T3>Exposure levels in the rolling mills can be controlledto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ through implementing controls such as isolationof workers, remote control technology, additional ventilation, and waterspray technology. The exposure problems in rolling are due to lead fumesand dust being generated from the surfaces of the hot leaded steel as itis being rolled. The isolation of workers can effectively control exposure levels in therolling process because most employees do not need to be in close proximityto the rolling steel except when performing certain limited tasks suchas temperature monitoring and gauging. Even these operations can be performedremotely by remote temperature sensing and automatic gauging devices, whichare available on the market and would virtually eliminate the need forworkers to routinely remain close to the steel furnaces or rollers. Thus,as in the soaking pits operation, remote control technology in combinationwith isolation of workers in ventilated enclosed workstation can certainlyreduce exposure levels down to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In order to control exposures at their source, local exhaust ventilationalso can be used. OSHA recognizes that ventilation systems, like otherequipment, may be vulnerable to damage by cobble formation (Ex. 681, p.13). However, OSHA believes that cobble formation does not occur in primaryrolling mills and is only a rare occurrence in bar rolling mills (Tr. 1056).Moreover, since industry has managed to sustain its production systemsdespite cobble formation, OSHA believes industry can sustain its controlsystems as well. Consequently, the possibility of cobble formation cannotbe used to justify a failure to implement necessary engineering controls.<T3>Surface Conditioning. </T3>Grinding and scarfing generally can be performedwith semi-automated grinders and scarfers by remote control from enclosedand ventilated workstations to reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in surface conditioning. These machines are available and already in usein some plants in the industry (observed by JACA some years ago; Ex. 553-6,p.1-3; Tr. 741). The operator in the workstation directs the slab througha scarfing operation, for example, by rolling the slab through a seriesof automatic torches that burn away the surface imperfections. Middoughhas acknowledged that ``the surface conditioning by semi-automated grindingmachines, with properly maintained filtering and air conditioning systems,decreases the employee lead exposure'' (Ex. 582-87, Att. A. p. 13). Middoughalso identified one facility that had an older grinding system in whichthe operator's cab was open (Ex. 582-87, Att. A, p. 13). OSHA believesthat the operator's exposure to lead is minimal when the operator is isolatedfrom the source of emission (Ex. 611, pp. 29-30). With mechanization, manual operations can be minimized, significantly reducingemployee exposure. In the limited number of circumstances where hand grindingor hand scarfing may be necessary, local exhaust is feasible and effective,although it may not be capable of maintaining air lead levels consistentlyat or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Where this results in employees being exposedabove the PEL as an 8-hour TWA, employers will be allowed to provide employeeswith respirators for supplemental protection during hand grinding or handscarfing. <T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusion.  </T3>Based upon the above analysisof the evidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, theAgency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementingreadily available engineering and work practice controls is technologicallyfeasible for the leaded steel industry as a whole. Nevertheless, the Agencyrecognizes that it may not be possible to consistently achieve the PELby these controls for the limited amount of hand scarfing and hand grindingthat must be done. Since OSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL feasible for the industry,employers will be required in hand grinding and hand scarfing, as well,to implement engineering and work practice controls to control exposureslevels to the PEL or the lowest feasible level. Where all feasible engineeringand work practice controls have been implemented and employees performingthese tasks are still exposed above the PEL as an 8-hour TWA, employerswill be allowed to provide these workers with respirators for supplementalprotection while they are performing hand grinding or hand scarfing. Through its analysis of the record in the previous sections, OSHA has demonstratedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) At least 75% of the employees exposed to lead in the steel industryare exposed only on occasion above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and have average exposurelevels that generally are well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Exs. 681, p. 16;688a). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) At LTV's plant, 81% of all sampling results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,and 93% are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table 1, above). In the operationin the industry that is most difficult to control, steel pouring, averageexposure levels in three of the five job classifications at LTV are below40 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In each of the remaining two job classifications geometricmean exposure levels are 40 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 688a). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) With regard to teeming, rolling, and surface conditioning, theonly areas in the industry identified by AISI as problems (Ex. 681, pp.6-14), at LTV 90% of the sampling results in rolling and surface conditioningare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and in teeming 65% are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 688a).</ITAG>These results have been obtained before recommended additional controlshave been implemented and before cross contamination is controlled. Consequentlyin most operations few, if any, additional controls are needed to bringexposure levels to or below 50 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA believes that, for operations where most sampling results or geometricor arithmetic mean exposure levels already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,relatively modest improvements in controls, such as improved housekeepingor better preventive maintenance, will be sufficient to reduce air leadlevels consistently to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarly, for operationswhere most of the sampling results or geometric or arithmetic means arebelow 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA believes that a combination of limited additionaland improved controls (e.g., improving the efficiency of the ventilationsystem), will be sufficient to control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In the three areas in the industry identified by AISI as problems, whereimplementation of additional controls may be necessary at certain plantsto control exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, adequate controlsare readily available.In reaching the above conclusions, OSHA has relied in part on data providedby LTV. However, OSHA does not believe that LTV is at the limits of technologicalfeasibility, and LTV has testified to this effect (Tr. 1028-29). OSHA believesthat additional reductions in workers' exposure levels can be achievedat LTV and that these reductions are generally achievable by the rest ofthe industry as well. There is no evidence in the record to show that LTV is atypical. Indeed,although AISI was aware that Meridian relied heavily on LTV's data in concludingthat the PEL is technologically feasible in leaded steel, at no time hasAISI asserted that LTV is unrepresentative of the industry. In addition,LTV has testified that they are typical with regard to size and natureof operations (Tr. 893). OSHA therefore believes that it is reasonableto treat LTV's data as representative of existing exposures in the industryand/or as representative of what the industry can achieve technologically.OSHA has had to rely upon the LTV data set because no other recent dataorganized on a plant-by-plant basis were made available. However, even if the LTV data were not representative of the industry andeven if OSHA were to accept at face value AISI's final submission of datacollected from various producers as reasonably representative, accordingto that data more than one-third of the sampling results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\and more than two-thirds are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. AISI's data alsosuggests that approximately 41% of the sampling results in teeming arebelow 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, 93% of the sampling results in casting are below100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, 85% of the sampling results in rolling are below 100andCx.18;g/m\3\, and 73% of the sampling results in conditioning are below100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 694-41, p. 21). Thus, in all operations with theexception of teeming, at least 73% of the monitoring samples are below100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Based on these data, OSHA would still conclude that,with the application of available controls discussed above, controllingmost leaded steel operations to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of the timeis technologically feasible. OSHA has already indicated that implementinga combination of limited, additional and improved controls generally willbe sufficient to reduce air lead levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ inoperations where most sampling results already are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In concluding that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL is technologically feasiblefor the leaded steel industry, OSHA does not purport to have recommendedan exhaustive list of additional controls. The Agency also has not neededto exercise its statutory authority to force the development of new technologyto justify its finding. The Agency has relied exclusively upon conventionaland readily available controls. OSHA is certain that industry will be capable of devising and fine-tuningother conventional controls to further reduce exposure levels. Consequently,OSHA anticipates that industry will be able to consistently achieve exposurelevels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in nearly every phase of production.OSHA acknowledges that the lead standard is strict and believes that toachieve the PEL requires implementing an integrated system of controls.The basic element in that system is an industrial hygiene study. Each producershould have an experienced industrial hygienist perform an in-depth job/taskanalysis and a plant-wide survey. This survey and analysis should identifysources of emission in each task, sources of cross drafts or cross contamination,and appropriate sites for erecting cross contamination barriers. Such analysisshould also recommend appropriate engineering and work practice controlsto reduce emissions and minimize employee exposures. If, after implementingthese recommendations, reductions in air lead levels deviate substantiallyfrom what was anticipated, a follow-up industrial hygiene survey shouldbe conducted and necessary corrections made. The second element in that system is the development of good, written housekeepingand work practice programs that are systematically implemented and enforcedby employers so that proper procedures are routinely and meticulously followed.Testimony in the record indicates that housekeeping can be improved inthe leaded steel industry (Tr. 1121-22). The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean and efficientcondition. AISI does not agree that it is technologically feasible to achieve a PELof 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controls.AISI has raised a number of objections concerning the competence and conclusionsof OSHA's contractor, Meridian, as well as broader objections concerningthe feasibility of achieving the PEL in problem areas within the industry.AISI's principal objections are as follows. (1) Meridian is not competentto assess technological feasibility in leaded steel, has been predisposedto finding the standard feasible, and has made numerous factual mistakes.(2) No technology exists to control exposure levels throughout the industryto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the industry already is implementingall feasible technology. (3) More specifically, continuous casting is nota realistic alternative to teeming as a method for controlling exposuresto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and within teeming no feasible engineeringcontrols can reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. (4) OSHAalso has been predisposed to find the PEL feasible regardless of the recordevidence. First, AISI has devoted an extraordinary amount of effort in its commentsand at the hearing to impugning the competence and integrity of OSHA'scontractor, Meridian. AISI has variously charged Meridian with a lack ofnecessary experience and training, repudiating its previous positions,grossly mistaken opinions, distortions of the data, and the like (Exs.681, pp. 21-24; 694-41, pp. 4-9). On the whole, OSHA finds most of AISI'scharges to be poorly founded, grossly exaggerated, or internally contradictory.In any event, OSHA has made independent evaluations of the data and evidencein reaching its conclusions and has relied on Meridian on certain limitedoccasions only to independently confirm OSHA's own conclusions.Meridian has had very broad experience and possesses very broad competencein the area of industrial hygiene, the principles of which are universallyapplicable to all industries (Ex. 601). There is nothing unique about controllinglead dust and lead fume that would make Meridian's extensive expertiseand competence in evaluating engineering and work practice controls irrelevantto the leaded steel industry. Contrary to AISI's allegations, controlsthat have been used in other industries generally are readily transferableto leaded steel, although some modifications may be necessary, as theywould be almost anywhere, to adapt the controls to particular equipmentor operations.AISI criticizes Meridian for revising some of its conclusions in its finalreport. For example, AISI criticizes Meridian for its allegedly new emphasisin its final report on continuous casting as an alternative to teeming.On the other hand, elsewhere in its submissions AISI also criticizes previousfindings and understandings in Meridian's preliminary assessment and inOSHA's preamble to the proposal (Ex. 582-87, pp. 11-14). AISI cannot haveit both ways. Either OSHA and its contractors have to maintain their preliminaryunderstandings and findings regardless of the evidence subsequently introducedinto the record or they are entitled to revise their findings after takingthe additional evidence into account.Indeed, the latter is precisely what is contemplated by OSHA s rulemakingprocess. That process requires OSHA at the outset to make proposals onthe basis of preliminary findings and understandings and then encouragesthe public and interested parties to present comments, information anddata to correct and clarify the record. Thus, it is expected and entirelyappropriate that the Agency and its contractors will revise their findingsand understandings when newly introduced evidence in the record mandatessuch revisions. Courts have recognized that this is appropriate and necessary,so long as the revisions are logical outgrowths of the proposal. Such changesdo not require OSHA to begin the hearing process all over again. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall.</T3> 647 F.2d at 1221.More specifically, with regard to AISI's claim that Meridian has cruciallyand erroneously relied upon continuous casting for its proof of feasibility,OSHA finds AISI's argument a misinterpretation of Meridian's position.Meridian does not rely heavily on continuous casting; nor does it say thatcontinuous casting can be used everywhere in the near future to produceleaded steel (Ex. 686H, p. 14).Many of AISI's charges that Meridian has prejudged and distorted the dataare predicated upon AISI's own mischaracterization of Meridian's arguments.This is true, for example, of Meridian s argument concerning continuouscasting and of its summary of the LTV data (see OSHA's discussion in thesection of this preamble dealing with existing exposure levels).Industry's second criticism is that it is not technologically feasibleto achieve the PEL in the leaded steel industry. OSHA disagrees. As demonstratedpreviously not only is it technologically feasible to achieve the PEL inthe leaded steel industry, but LTV, one of the five leaded steel producers,has already controlled exposure levels to or below 50 mg/m\3\ most of thetime in all, or nearly all of its operations. AISI does not allege thatLTV is unrepresentative of the leaded steel industry, and OSHA is confidentthat LTV is reasonably representative.Industry also asserts that it is not technologically feasible to achieve50 mg/m\3\ because industry has already done all that is feasible. However,in at least several areas AISI or its contractor have stated that additionalcontrols could be implemented (e.g., enclosing cabs of mobile equipmentand improving work practices) to further reduce exposure levels. If producersother than LTV have not controlled exposures in their facilities to achievethe PEL, it is not because they are already at the limits of technologicalfeasibility but because they have failed to implement all feasible controls.OSHA is not convinced by the feasibility assessment performed for industryby Middough Associates, an industry consultant (Ex. 582-87, AttachmentA). In that assessment Middough concludes that leaded steel producers ``couldspend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to upgrade already adequatecontrol facilities and not maintain employee lead exposure levels below50 mg/m\3\'' (Ex. 582-87, Attachment A, p. 1). OSHA finds this assessment,including its conclusion, to be unpersuasive and unsubstantiated.When questioned at the hearing about what Middough meant when it asserted50 mg/m\3\ was infeasible, the firm's representative said Middough meantit is ``not possible to routinely attain that level, on a regular basis.''When asked to further explain what was meant by ``not possible to routinelyattain that level,'' he responded, ``There will always be excursions fromthat level * * *.'' Upon further questioning, he said there could be oneor more excursions (Tr. 989-90).OSHA accepts Middough's view that the leaded steel industry cannot achieve50 mg/m\3\ 100% of the time and that there will be some excursions abovethat level. However, OSHA believes that the existence of such ``excursions''does not constitute evidence of technological infeasibility. Excursionscan occur even as an industry controls exposure levels to 50 mg/m\3\ mostof the time in most of its operations.In any event, the feasibility assessment submitted by Middough to the recordlacks substantiation. In its report, Middough does not, for example, includea supporting analysis of exposure data at various plants throughout theindustry. Middough also does not perform a systematic analysis, operation-by-operationand plant-by-plant, to show what existing controls are associated withcurrent exposure levels and what additional controls could be implementedto lower those levels.Third and more specifically, AISI contends that continuous casting is nota realistic alternative to teeming leaded steel and that it is technologicallyinfeasible to achieve 50 mg/m\3\ in teeming. With regard to continuouscasting, AISI contends that this process cannot be used to cast all gradesof leaded steel, that in any event 50 mg/m\3\ cannot be achieved in continuouscasting, that continuous casting requires extensive and extremely costlyventilation, and that adding continuous casters capable of producing leadedsteel requires specially designing and installing bloom casters that costhundreds of millions of dollars (Ex. 694-41, p. 5).OSHA agrees in part and disagrees in part with AISI's contention. NeitherMeridian nor OSHA has asserted that adopting continuous casting could providean immediate solution for controlling excessive exposure levels in pouringand casting leaded steel. Indeed, both Meridian and OSHA expressly statethat industry's capability to use continuous casting to produce leadedsteel is dependent in part upon industry's further expansion of continuouscasting capacity for producing steel in general (Ex. 686H, p. 14). On theother hand, two of the five plants in the industry already have continuouscasters capable of producing leaded steel. In the case of one unnamed plant,leaded steel currently is routinely being produced by this method. In thecase of LTV, leaded steel has been experimentally produced by continuouscasting. As OSHA has shown, when continuous casting has been utilized,whether routinely or experimentally, most sampling results have been ator below 50 mg/m\3\ (Exs. 688a; 694-41, p. 16).With regard to AISI's other assertions concerning continuous casting, whileit might be true that not all grades of leaded steel can be continuouslycast, AISI provides no information about which grades can and cannot beso cast or what proportion of leaded steel output they occupy. Consequently,even if AISI's claim is accurate, OSHA still cannot determine its significance.Finally, OSHA believes that the high costs associated with installing continuouscasters and whatever ventilation may be needed to control exposure levelsin that process are attributable to the broader modernization process thesteel industry has been carrying out. Increased leaded steel productionby continuous casting and the control of air lead levels in that processwill have to piggyback on industry modernization, which has already beenstimulated by market forces.Concerning pouring, OSHA has already shown that at least at LTV 78% ofall sampling results in that process in 1987-88 are below 50 mg/m\3\. Inaddition, in three of the job classifications comprising pouring, averageexposure levels are at or below 40 mg/m\3\. In the two job classificationswhere the arithmetic mean is above 50 mg/m\3\, the geometric  mean  in each  case  is  40   mg/m\3\. In these classifications, the arithmeticmean is being driven upwards by the presence of a few atypically high exposurereadings.Lastly, AISI argues that OSHA, as well, as Meridian, was predisposed tofinding feasibility regardless of record evidence (Ex. 694-41, pp. 3, 10).OSHA is under a statutory obligation to protect workers from a significantrisk of material impairment to health to the extent feasible. OSHA hastaken this obligation seriously and has carried out an assessment of technologicalfeasibility based on the evidence and analyses included in the record.It is primarily due to the data that LTV submitted to the record, and notto any OSHA bias, that OSHA has concluded that it is feasible to achievethe PEL by means of engineering and work practice controls.Consequently, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry arguments. Based upon itsown expertise, experience and the record evidence, OSHA concludes thata PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible by means of engineeringand work practice controls in the leaded steel industry. <T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Leaded Steel is classified under SIC code 3312and is currently manufactured at five sites by five producers, though furtherprocessing may occur at virtually any site [Ex. 583-54]. The five leaded steel producers manufactured approximately 667,000 nettons of leaded steel in 1986, accounting for 3 to 16 percent of the totalnet tonnage of steel manufactured at these sites [Ex. 582-87, p. 24]. About80-85% of all leaded steel products consumed annually in this country areproduced by these five integrated producers, while imports make up thebalance [Ex. 582-87, p. 25]. (LTV Corporation reports that Voluntary RestraintAgreements had reduced the import market share to 21.3 percent [Ex. 694-41,Attachment 6, p. 4]). During testimony at the informal public hearing, Mr. Terrence M. Civicof LTV Steel Company testified that<ITAG tagnum="20">[i]n the bar facilities throughout the industry, there are approximately11,000 employees. Of those 11,000 employees, 18 percent have exposure tolead. Of those 18 percent with exposure to lead, 89 percent of those employeeswould have an occasion to be exposed to concentrations in excess of 50micrograms per cubic meter on a time-weighted average. The percentage numberof employees with average exposures that are greater than 50 microgramsper cubic meter on a time-weighted average is approximately 25 percent[Tr., p. 935].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This produces an estimate of 495 workers with average TWA exposuresto lead in excess of 50 micrograms per cubic meter. With regard to the possibility of substituting for the use of lead in steel,<ITAG tagnum="20">[i]n general, there is no one material or process that can be usedeconomically to substitute for the lead in leaded steel. Any attempt toeliminate lead from steel would require metallurgical research, engineeringdesign, retooling, and the development of substitutes for lead in specificapplications [Ex. 578, p. 22].</ITAG>Financial data based on the first three quarters of 1987 included datafor the five individual producers of leaded steel [Ex. 686h, p. 7] andindicate improvement in the profitability of the steel industry as comparedwith 1986 data [Ex. 578, p. 34-35]. For company ``a,'' data indicate animprovement in its rate of return on assets (ROA) from ^0.08 to an estimated1 percent. ROA for company ``b'' improved from ^0.59 to an estimated 8.8percent, while ROA for company ``c'' improved from ^0.03 to an estimated2.9 percent. Company ``d,'' which was profitable in 1986, realized an improvementof ROA from 0.01 to an estimated 3.0 percent. Overall, profits of approximately$900 million were expected for the industry in 1987 as opposed to its $5.2billion in losses the previous year. Factors which have contributed tothe improved profitability of the steel industry are strengthening demand,tax benefits, firming of import prices, the ability to realize higher prices,the closing of antiquated facilities, and reduced labor costs [Ex. 686h,p 6]. <ITAG tagnum="21">More recent data show that one firm, Copperweld, sustained a lossfor the year. (Copperweld's loss was magnified by their inventory valuationmethod [Ex. 694-41, Attachment 7]). Also, though LTV continued its reorganizationunder Chapter 11 [Ex. 694-41, Attachment 6], the company's net income wasapproximately $500 million in 1987. </ITAG>While available information reflects the difficulties being experiencedin bar manufacturing [Ex. 694-41, Attachment 6, p. 4], which is the segmentof the steel industry where leaded steel is produced, certain manufacturersindicated their commitment to the bar market. For example, Inland is forminga new company for its shaped products, and they feel that they can be successfulin the bar and structural steel market. One hundred million dollars couldbe invested in these facilities [Ex. 694-41, Attachment 5]. CopperweldSteel is also optimistic, as they are ``totally committed to being thetop quality bar producer in the United States'' [Ex. 694-41, Attachment7]. Copperweld has established a ``working relationship'' with Daido SteelCo., Ltd. of Japan and the companies have signed a three year technologyexchange agreement. These attitudes reflect the trend toward the major restructuring of thesteel industry in the U.S.:<ITAG tagnum="20">[t]he steel industry is also making substantial investments in modernization.Continuous casting, for example, can reduce operating costs by $25 to $40per ton. Although the U.S. steel industry lags behind most other developedcountries in the adoption of continuous casting, more than 26 million tonsof annual continuous casting capacity were added between 1983 and 1987,and at least 3 million tons more will be added by 1990. Between 1984 and1987, the share of production done with continuous casting increased bymore than 50 percent, and over three-fifths of all steel is now producedby this method * * * For some companies, the modernization is even morepervasive. Bethlehem Steel, for example, has invested nearly $2 billionin modernization since 1981 and now has sufficient continuous casting capabilityto handle 70 percent of its raw steel production_up from 30 percent in1982 * * * [Ex. 686h, p 3].</ITAG><T3>Cost of Compliance. </T3>The two methods used to produce leaded steelare continuous casting and teeming. For each method, costs will be incurredfor automated weighing and dispensing of lead shot, enclosed pulpits foroperators in rolling mill, automated gauging equipment, crane cab enclosures,portable vacuums, local exhaust ventilation, and housekeeping (annual cleaning).The continuous caster will also require an enclosed pulpit for the casting/tundisharea while the facilities which teem will require automated mold coveringsystems. Costs for remote temperature sensing equipment were assumed tobe negligible. Also, costs for automated surface conditioning equipmentwere not estimated, since evidence in the public record indicated thatsuch equipment is currently in use by all manufacturers [Ex. 582-87, AttachmentA]. Costs for each type of facility are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. Costs of an automated system for weighing and dipensing lead shot are estimatedto be $20,000 [Ex. 686h, p. 20]. Total annual costs for this equipmentwill be $4,936, including $2,936 in annualized capital costs and $2,000in operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses. (Annualized costs forall equipment were based on a twelve year useful life and a 10 percentfinancing cost). Enclosed pulpits for operators in the casting/tundish and rolling millareas will be $20,000 each [Ex. 578, p. 44, footnote]. Total annual costs,including annualized capital costs and Oandamp;M expenses (which includeHEPA filter replacement), are expected to be $5,186 for each pulpit, oneof which is assumed to be required in each area.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>5_<T4>Summary of Compliance Costs_Teeming </T4><H1>Control </H1><H1>Annualized capital costs </H1><H1>Annual Oandamp;M costs </H1><H1>Total annual costs </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Vent. improvements <D>$71,565 </D><D>$48,750 </D><D>$120,315 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Local vent._</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rolling mill <D>39,636 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>66,636 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface conditioning <D>39,636 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>66,636 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automated dispensing_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lead shot <D>2,936 </D><D>2,000 </D><D>4,936 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mold covering system <D>2,936 </D><D>2,000 </D><D>4,936 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Enclosed pulpit_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rolling mill <D>2,936 </D><D>2,250 </D><D>5,186 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automated gauging <D>7,340 </D><D>5,000 </D><D>12,340 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crane cab enclosures (2) <D>11,744 </D><D>8,500 </D><D>20,244 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Portable vacuums (3) <D>1,718 </D><D>7,170 </D><D>8,888 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Labor <D> </D><D>15,488 </D><D>15,488 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Annual cleaning <D> </D><D>50,000 </D><D>50,000 </D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals <D>180,447 </D><D>195,158 </D><D>375,604 </D><F> Source: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of RegulatoryAnalysis. </F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,8,8,8 </C><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Summary of Compliance Costs_Continuous Casting </T4><H1>Control </H1><H1>Annualized capital costs </H1><H1>Annual Oandamp;M costs </H1><H1>Total annual costs </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Vent. improvements <D>$286,260 </D><D>$195,000 </D><D>$481,260 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Local vent._ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rolling mill <D>39,636 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>66,636 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface conditioning <D>39,636 </D><D>27,000 </D><D>66,636 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automated dispensing_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lead shot <D>2,936 </D><D>2,250 </D><D>5,186 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Enclosed pulpit_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Rolling mill <D>2,936 </D><D>2,250 </D><D>5,186 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Casting/Tundish area <D>2,936 </D><D>2,000 </D><D>4,936 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automated gauging <D>7,340 </D><D>5,000 </D><D>12,340 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crane cab enclosures (2) <D>11,744 </D><D>8,500 </D><D>20,244 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Portable vacuums (3) <D>1,718 </D><D>7,170 </D><D>8,888 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Labor <D> </D><D>15,488 </D><D>15,488 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Annual cleaning <D> </D><D>50,000 </D><D>50,000 </D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals <D>395,142 </D><D>341,658 </D><D>736,799 </D><F> Source: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of RegulatoryAnalysis. </F></ITAG></ITAG> Costs for automated gauging equipment are estimated to be $50,000. Annualizedcapital costs would be $7,340 and Oandamp;M expenses would be $5,000. Totalannual costs for this equipment are estimated to be $12,340.Costs for crane cab enclosures will be $40,000 each [Ex. 686e, p. 21].Two cab enclosures are expected to be required per facility. Total capitalcosts are thus $80,000. The total annual costs of $20,244 include $11,744in annualized capital costs and $8,500 in Oandamp;M expenses, which includeHEPA filter replacement.Costs for portable vacuums to clean surfaces are estimated to be $3,900each [Ex. 579, p. 29]. It is estimated that three such vacuums will berequired. Annual costs, including annualized capital costs of $1,718 forall three units and Oandamp;M expenses of $7,170, which include HEPA filterreplacement, were estimated to be $8,888. Additional labor required wasassumed to be 3 person-hours per day. Costs were estimated to be $15,488per year, based on an average wage of $14.75 and a 7 day, 50 week annualhousekeeping schedule.Ventilation costs include improvement costs for ventilation systems inthe teeming and tundish areas as well as costs for local exhaust ventilationfor the rolling mill (primarily in the area of the mill stands) and foroccasional exposures during manual surface conditioning.Evidence compiled during the informal public hearing indicates that themanufacturers engaged in the teeming of leaded steel have already implementedcertain ventilation controls in an attempt to limit exposure to lead. Thesecontrols were described by Middough Associates [Ex. 582-87, AttachmentA] and AISI [Ex. 582-87, p. 10]. OSHA recommends that the manufacturerswho teem leaded steel improve local and general ventilation and ensurethat these systems are properly maintained. These improvements should alsoinclude any necessary barriers to prevent disruptive air currents. Ventilationimprovement costs were estimated to be 50 percent of installation costs,based on information received by AISI in response to a 1981 questionnaire[Exs. 578, pp. 38-39]. For a typical system of 65,000 cfm, ventilationimprovement costs were estimated to be $487,500. Annualized capital costswould be $71,565 and Oandamp;M expenses would be $48,750. Total annual costswere thus estimated to be $120,315. The continuous casting ventilationsystem described by AISI in their latest submission to the docket uses144,000 cfm to ventilate the tundish area, 120,000 cfm to ventilate thearea where steel is torch cut into bloom lengths, and 20,000 cfm for atorch cut-off station for samples. [Ex. 694-41, p. 15]. Total costs forthis system were $3.9 million, according to AISI [Ex. 694-41, p. 7]. Improvementcosts were estimated to be $1.95 million (one-half the cost of installinga $3.9 million system). Annualized capital costs would be $286,260. Operationand maintenance costs are expected to be $195,000 annually. Total annualcosts were thus estimated to be $481,260 for this equipment.The rolling mill and surface conditioning areas were assumed to requirelocal exhaust ventilation systems with air handling capacities of 18,000cfm. Applying a unit cost factor of $15/cfm, total capital costs for eachsystem were estimated to be $270,000. Annualized capital costs would be$39,636 and Oandamp;M expenses would be $27,000. Thus, total annual costsfor each system were estimated to be $66,636.Costs for an annual cleaning were estimated to be $50,000 for each facility($5,000 per day over 10 days) [Ex. 694-9, Company A response.]Costs for a system to cover ingot molds by remote control were assumedto be similar to those required to implement automated dispensing of leadshot. Capital costs for this system were thus estimated to be $20,000.Annual costs would be $4,936.Altering the process so that the lead shot is added directly to the ladlewould be expected to increase ventilation costs sharply, and, therefore,would not be implemented unless absolutely necessary. (For this reason,these costs have not been included in Table 5). Additional expenditureswould be required to provide exhaust ventilation for the ladle itself aswell as for the associated travelling ductwork system and necessary baghousecapacity. Based on the cost requirements for the ventilation of the teemingaisle [Ex. 578], OSHA expects the additional costs for ladle ventilationto be at least $1 million. Annual costs, including annualized capital andOandamp;M expenses, would be $246,800.Total annual costs for those facilities teeming leaded steel are estimatedto range from $375,604 to $622,404, depending upon whether a ladle ventilationsystem is implemented. Total annual costs for the continuous casting operationwere estimated to be $736,799.Only one of the five integrated producers is currently casting leaded steel[Ex. 582-87, Attachment A, p. 9]. OSHA computed total industry costs, andhence, impacts, based on the scenario of one continuous caster of leadedsteel and four teemers. This combination produced a total annual cost rangefor the industry of $2.24 million to $3.23 million.<T3>Economic Feasibility.</T3> In assessing economic feasibility for theleaded steel industry, OSHA compared the estimated costs of compliancewith estimated profit and sales levels. Sales data for two of the fiveproducers of leaded steel were provided for 1987 [Ex. 694-41, Attachments6 and 7]. These data appear consistent with those reported by Meridian[Ex. 686h, p. 6-7]; therefore, OSHA based its analysis on the Meridianinformation with one exception, Company ``e,'' though profitable in thethird quarter of 1987 [Ex. 686h, p. 7], incurred a net loss for the year.This loss is reflected in Tables 7 and 8. The portion of sales attributableto the production of leaded steel has been estimated at 0.8 percent oftotal sales, which represents the fraction of total production tonnagethat was leaded steel in 1987 [Ex. 686h, pp. 1-2].In assessing the impacts of the costs of compliance, two sets of impactratios had to be developed, since the leaded steel producers did not identifythe continuous caster for the record. Table 7 contains ratios for eachproducer assuming each teems leaded steel and Table 8 contains ratios assumingeach uses continuous casting.As seen in Table 7, price increases required with respect to leaded steelproducts would range from about 0.3 percent to about 3.7 percent for firms``a'' through ``d'' and could be between 25 and 41 percent for firm ``e'',assuming teeming is the method of casting used. Costs as a percentage ofoverall after-tax profits should range from 0.09 percent to 0.68 percentfor firms ``a'' through ``d'' and could represent between 2.9 percent and4.7 percent of losses for firm ``e.''<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>7._<T4>Summary of Economic Impacts for the Leaded Steel Industry_Teeming</T4><H1>Company</H1><H1>Costs (range) ($ thous.)</H1><H2>Min.</H2><H2>Max.</H2><H1>Sales ($ thous.) </H1>a<H1>Sales/lead rel.

Profitimpacts would fall between 0.2 percent and 0.8 percent for firms ``a''through ``d'' and would represent about 5.6 percent of losses for firm``e.'' It should be noted that the tax-deductibility of compliance costs was takeninto account in computing profit impacts. That is, care was taken to computebefore-tax profit before subtracting annual costs. After subtracting annualcosts, the appropriate average tax rate (either 0 or 34 percent) was thenreapplied to determine after-tax profit net of costs. These figures suggest that for most firms, a good portion of the costsof compliance could be passed through, as there is no general all-purposesubstitute for leaded steel (demand for this product is estimated to berelatively inelastic) [Ex. 578, pp. 49-50] and U.S. producers are internationallycompetitive (see below). The impact estimates computed above also indicate that for all firms profitimpacts at the corporate level will be quite small, regardless of productionscheme. OSHA has based its calculations of profit impacts on overall profits foreach firm. Though AISI noted that the profitability of steel is not uniformacross all segments of the industry [Ex. 681, p. 36], no profit data specificto leaded steel operations were made available by AISI or by the leadedsteel producers; however, since this product is estimated to constituteabout 0.8 percent of total sales, it is clear that impacts on profits generatedby leaded operations will necessarily be greater than the impacts on totalprofits shown in Tables 7 and 8. Information on bar and structural operations,which include the production of leaded steel, indicates that for at leastthree of the five producers, Copperweld, LTV, and Inland, these operationswere not profitable in 1987 [Ex. 694-41, Attachments 5, 6, 7]. For Copperweld,which produces only bar steel and reported losses of $13,161,000 in 1987,annual costs, which range from $376,000 to $737,000, represent about 2.9to 5.6 percent of losses. For Inland, which reported losses of $31,000,000for bar and structural operations in 1987, annual costs represent about1.2 to 2.4 percent of losses. Thus, profit impacts with respect to barand structural operations, while greater than those profit impacts indicatedabove with respect to overall corporate operations, are likely to be small.Based on this analysis, OSHA has determined that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ standardis economically feasible for the producers of leaded steel. OSHA's reasoningis as follows. First, impact computations indicate that the costs of compliance can befinanced through the combination of pass-through and absorption. Additionally,OSHA does not believe that compliance costs are of sufficient magnitudeto force manufacturers to shift away from the product. (Should one or morefirms choose this alternative, market share will increase for those firmsremaining, though foreign competition could be a factor.) Second, the most costly compliance scenario, that estimated for the continuouscaster, will only be required for one manufacturer. Third, as noted above, at least two of the five producers have expressedtheir commitment to the bar and structural steel markets. It is unlikelythat the costs associated with this regulation would affect these corporations'decisions to continue to produce leaded steel. Also, though LTV is in reorganizationand its ability to invest in controls may be limited, OSHA believes thatcost estimates were greatly overstated for this firm, as exposure dataindicate that LTV is very close to compliance. Finally, in assessing this industry's ability to pass on and absorb costs,OSHA took into account the recent decline in the value of the dollar againstforeign currencies. Under these conditions, which enable U.S. producersto be more price competitive with foreign producers, it is not surprisingto see increased demand leading to reactivation of facilities, resultingin increasing sales and profit levels. (One U.S. producer recently activatedan idle facility to handle increasing overseas demand). And, while employmentcosts have traditionally been high, production employment has been decliningdue to increased efficiency and modernization efforts. This trend increasesthe steel industry's ability to absorb the costs of compliance. OSHA concludes that this standard is economically feasible for the leadedsteel industry with a compliance schedule of two and one-half years. Asnoted above, industry profitability has improved recently. The industryhas expressed its intent to invest in the bar segment of the market andcompliance costs are not of sufficient magnitude to alter these commitments.With regard to production efficiency, OSHA believes that the costs imposedby this regulation are negligible compared to the investment required formodernization and will not have a significant impact on this industry.The impacts of this regulation will not threaten the existence of the leadedsteel industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Non-Ferrous Foundry Industry </ITAG><T3>Process Description and Sources of Exposure_Overview. </T3>Non-ferrousfoundries produce castings of various sizes and complexity. Generally,the castings are produced by melting copper-based ingots, pouring the moltenmetal into molds, usually made of sand, allowing the metal to cool, andremoving the castings, which are then cleaned and finished. The main operationsare moldmaking and coremaking; furnace operations, which include charging,melting, tapping, drossing and transferring molten metal; pouring moltenmetal into molds; shakeout of castings from molds; cleaning and finishingof castings, which include cutting and grinding; and handling sand (Exs.689-5; 686A, pp. 26-40; and 581-2). Lead is added to molten copper alloys to enhance pressure tightness, lubricity,and machinability of castings (Ex. and 582-84, p. 2). Lead is added inconcentrations that range at the extremes from .02-42.5% (Exs. 475-3, p.2; and 582-84, p. 2). Three of the most common lead-containing copper alloysare leaded red brass (5% lead), valve metal (7% lead), and bearing bronze(13-22% lead), which are used to produce castings for water works, plumbingequipment, and machine bearings, respectively (Ex. 689-5). The typical sand-mold casting process involves the following operations.<T3>Moldmaking and Coremaking. </T3>Sand molds are used to create externalshapes of castings while cores, which are placed inside of molds, are usedto create internal spaces in castings. Sand molds are formed by automatic molding machines or jolt squeezers,which press and bind together prepared sand or other materials into particularpatterns. Automatic molding machines dispense and pack sand into moldswithout employees coming into physical contact with sand. (Ex. 684f, p.4). During automatic mold making at Foundry F, for example, sand fallsfrom a hopper over the work station into the mold press. Excess sand fallsapproximately four feet to the floor, and then falls into a collectiongrate. Sand missing the grate is swept into the grate with a broom. Coresare automatically placed inside the mold (Ex. 684f, pp. 4, 11). When jolt squeezers are used, molds are made by hand. The moldmaker dropssand into the flask from an overhead hopper, and distributes it by handthroughout the flask. The employee then uses a squeezer molding machineto press the mold shape into the sand. Employees place cores by hand atappropriate places in individual molds. After molds are formed, they mustbe transported to the pouring area where they are filled with molten metal.For example, at Foundry E molds are transported by a pallet system. Afterthe moldmaker has made enough molds to fill a pallet car, the pallet carcarries the molds from the squeezer to the pouring area (Ex. 684e, pp.2-3). <T3>Furnace Operations. </T3>The primary function of the furnace is tomelt metals. Furnace operations involve the following tasks: charging,melting, tapping, drossing and transferring molten metal. Furnaces can be of various types. The most commonly used furnaces in thenon-ferrous casting industry are crucible and induction furnaces (Exs.645, p. 5 and 689-3, p. 28). Furnaces can be fueled by gas, oil or electricityand can be tapped in a stationary position or by tilting or lifting. The composition of the charge to the furnace determines the kind of alloyproduced. To make up the charge, most melters use ingots already containingthe proper ratio of metals required for casting a particular alloy (Ex.571, p. 1). Some plants, however, formulate their own alloys, for example,by using copper scrap or ``raw'' lead from bars. If scrap is used, ancillaryscrap handling processes, like cutting, sawing, transferring and chargingscrap to a scrap heater, may be involved (Ex. 609, pp. 6-7). Metals are charged through an opening in the top or side of the furnace.The furnace can be charged by conveyor or crane. For example, at FoundryE the furnaces, which operate 365 days a year, are charged from the topwith 1,800 pounds of metal and are capable of melting 3,000 pounds of brassan hour. A charging bucket filled with metal is moved to the top of thefurnace with an electric hoist, and the bottom hatch of the bucket is thenopened, allowing the charge to fall into the furnace. Charging takes place10 times per shift, 20 times per day, consuming less than a minute eachtime (Ex. 684e, p. 2). When the melt is ready, the molten metal is tapped (poured) from the furnaceinto vessels like ladles for transportation to the pouring area. The ladles,which are pushed or controlled by employees known as hot-metal dispatchers,are transported to hand-pouring stations or automatic pouring lines onoverhead monorail tracks, overhead bridge cranes, overhead monorail cranes,or forklifts (Ex. 689-4D, p. 7-14). Impurities that float on the surface of the molten metal are called slagor dross. The dross, containing lead, is manually skimmed from the furnaceand/or the ladle to remove impurities from the molten metal. It is thenstored in covered or uncovered dross hoppers adjacent to the furnace onthe pouring line (Exs. 684e, p. 2; 684g, p. 11). <T3>Pouring.</T3> When the ladles or kettles containing molten metal arriveat the pouring station, the temperature of the metal is taken, and coldmetal may be added if the temperature is found to be too high. At manyfoundries, dross is then manually skimmed from the surface of the metal.The molten alloys are poured into molds as soon as possible to providegood casting quality. At Foundry F, the casting operation is performed on automated casting machines.Previously formed sand molds automatically rotate on a turntable to wherethe metal is automatically poured. The machine continually presents andthen retrieves individual molds to and from the hot-pouring operation (Ex.684f, p. 3). Elsewhere, small castings (less than 50 pounds) may be produced in moldsloaded on pallet decks. Special castings of large size or complexity maybe poured in a variety of ways, using stationary floor molds, pit moldsin fixed locations or molds on powered or manual roller conveyors (Ex.581-2, Prepared Testimony of J. Guimond, pp. 8-9). After molds are filled on the pouring deck, they are pushed or automaticallymoved through cooling courts to the shakeout area. <T3>Shakeout.</T3> In the shakeout area, solidified castings are separatedfrom sand molds. A wide variety of mechanical methods and equipment (e.g.tumbling mills), has been developed to handle various sizes and types ofcastings, alloys and different types of sand (Ex. 583-13, pp. 5-14 to 5-17).Some castings are removed simply by hand (e.g., from large floor molds),others are removed by automatic and enclosed equipment (Ex. 684f, p. 3).In a typical automated shakeout operation, molds are turned over to dislodgeand separate the castings and loose sand. The castings and sand drop toa vibrating conveyor which carries the casting to the sorting and cuttingarea and vibrates the loose sand off of the conveyor (Ex. 684f, p. 3).<T3>Cleaning and Finishing.</T3> Before castings are finished by cuttingand grinding, they are first sorted according to the subsequent finishingrequired. Finishing involves the removal of excess sand and metal fromthe casting. The removal can be accomplished by a variety of methods, likecutoff saws, grinders and buffers.There are several sources of excess metal in the casting process. For example,the channel into which the molten metal is poured to form the casting,as well as the channels connecting various castings in a mold, create excessmetal on the casting, known as gates, sprues, and risers. Some foundriesdesign the shapes of these channels to facilitate their removal, with theresult that they may be simply broken off by hand or removed by a mechanicalpress (``kiss-gating'') and recycled to the furnace. At Company E, forexample, kiss-gating techniques are used to the maximum extent possibleto reduce the number of parts that must be sawed in the cutoff saw area(Ex. 684e, p 3). Company representatives state that, because of kiss-gatingtechniques, grinding is not usually needed for many of the small castingsproduced. However, foundries do not use kiss-gating for some larger orunusually shaped parts. Where kiss-gating is not used, excess metal mustbe removed by cutoff saws (Ex. 684e, p. 3). After removal, the surfaceof the casting may be finished by grinding and buffing.Abrasive blasting, abrasive tools, cutting torches and other methods alsomay be used to remove finely burned-on sand and remaining excess metalfrom the casting. In many foundries, machine finishing such as grindingand cutoff is accomplished solely by abrasive wheels. Infrequently, a tumblingmill is used to dislodge sand by the impact of castings striking each otherin a rotating drum.<T3>Sand Handling.</T3> Some foundries recycle used sand; others do not,In foundries that do not recycle sand, sand handling consists of transportingnew sand to the moldmaking and coremaking operations and disposing of usedsand. In foundries that do recycle sand, sand handling involves additionalsteps to recondition and/or treat the used sand, to transport the reconditionedsand back to the moldmaking operation. and to mix it in proper proportionswith new sand, water, and binders.Foundries that recycle sand do so for two reasons. Recycling reduces costsand also is said to be necessary to properly condition the molds for certaincastings (Exs. 689-5, pp. 155-58; 678, p. 2). With recycled sand, new sandis mixed with heat-fractured sand fines of proper sizes. The recycled sandis transported by conveyors, loaders and other sand movers from reconditioningareas to mixers and mullers for cooling and addition of new sand, bindersand moisture (2-3%) to condition the sand.If olivine sand, an expensive alternative to silica sand, is used, it iscompletely recycled and seldom discarded (Ex. 609, p. 12). <T3>Sources of Exposure.</T3> The sources of high lead exposure in non-ferrousfoundries are fume emitted in the furnace and pouring operations and dustgenerated in the cutoff saw operation. Lower levels of lead exposure aregenerated from fume and dust in shakeout, grinding and from any contaminatedsand that is recycled and allowed to dry (Ex. 694-42, p. 5). However, FordMeter Box has pointed out that the lead content of airborne foundry dustis 3 to 5 times higher than the lead content of recycled sand (Ex. 678,p. 2). In addition, lead exposures in many operations generally are increasedby cross contamination from other operations (Exs. 571, p. 5; 694-42, p.6).For the vast majority of non-ferrous foundries that use preformulated alloyingots as their basic raw material, the handling of such ingots is nota source of lead exposure. These ingots present no lead exposure problemsuntil they are melted and processed. For those foundries that make up theirown charges from scrap and/or raw lead ingots, low-level exposures maybe produced. Raw lead stored in piles, bins, open containers or on palletsmay be exposed to the weather, and moisture may cause oxidation, producinga powdery coating of lead oxide that can become airborne during handlingIn addition, if the raw lead is worked, as in cutting or sawing, lead exposuresalso may be generated (Ex. 609, pp. 6-7).In the hot furnace and pouring operations, the tasks that contribute mostto high exposure levels are charging, tapping, transferring, drossing (slagging),and pouring. These tasks are a source of high levels of lead fume for employeesperforming them and for other employees in the furnace and pouring areas.In addition, these tasks are a source of significantly increased exposurelevels for employees elsewhere in the foundry who, because of proximityand/or cross drafts, are subjected to cross contamination from the furnaceand pouring operations.Once the molten alloy has been tapped from the furnace, the molten metalprovides a continuing source of lead fumes while it is being transferredto the pouring area, while slagging is taking place, and even after pouring,until the melt cools sufficiently for its surface to solidify. Thus, thefurnace filled with molten metal, the ladle into which the molten metalis tapped, and the mold into which the melt is poured all can provide continuingsources of lead exposure (Ex. 581-2, Prepared Testimony of J. Guimond,pp. 3, 5). In the pouring operation, employee exposures peak during theactual pouring of the mold (Ex. 581-2, p. 8). Where large molds are cast,the molds usually remain in place for some time to cool, so further exposureto lead can occur in unventilated areas.The extent of lead emissions in these work areas also depends on the temperatureof the melt, lead content of the charge, type of furnace, furnace firingrate, and, of course, upon the engineering and work practice controls employedto contain or avoid such emissions.In shakeout, the major source of workers' exposure is the opening of molds,which causes steam, ``smokes'', fume and dust trapped in the molds to beemitted. This occurs because dehydration of the sand from the intense heatof the molten metal allows lead-containing dust to form and subsequentlyescape when the mold is broken.During grinding and cutoff, the source of lead exposure is the lead containedin the cast alloy, which is abraded as dust during the process. The extentof workers' exposure to lead in grinding depends on the type of grinderused (e.g., snag grinder), the media of the abrasive wheel, the size andshape of the casting, the lead content of the alloy, the extent of automation,and how closely the operation is attended.Sand that has been contaminated by lead in the pouring operation also providesa source of continuing lead exposures until the sand is properly moistenedor treated to remove the contaminant. At Ford Meter Box, for example, where80% of the sand is recycled and the recycled sand contains .2% lead, approximately2,000 pounds of lead in 500 tons of sand are routed each day on conveyorbelts to be reused (Exs. 582-81, p. 31; 663).The accumulation of lead in the sand occurs because lead fumes are trappedin the walls of the porous sand molds and remain in the sand after shakeout(Exs. 581-2, Prepared Testimony of J. Guimond, p. 14). Exposures to lead-ladendust can occur at all points where dry, used sand is handled, for example,in the case of recycled sand, on route to the muller and after the mullerwherever water-tempered sand containing lead is allowed to dry (e.g., temperedsand falls off a conveyor and collects on the floor). Thus, recycled sandalso can provide a source of exposure to lead in an operation like moldmaking,which does not otherwise involve lead (Exs. 582-81, p. 31; 609, p.12; 663;678, p. 3).Aside from emissions from recycled, contaminated sand, the only other possiblesource of lead exposure in moldmaking is cross contamination from leaddust or fume emissions generated in adjacent operations (Ex. 571, p. 2).Moldmaking and coremaking do not necessarily require the use of lead orlead-containing substances in the processes. In the case of moldmaking,to the extent that new sand or substitutes can be used exclusively, thereis no internal source of lead. In the case of coremaking, recycled sandis not used, and as a result there is no internal source of lead. In coremaking,there is only a single, external source of lead: cross contamination fromother operations (Exs. 684f, pp. 4, 11; 694-42, p. 6). <T3>Exposure Levels._Overview.</T3> An overview of existing exposure levelsreveals the following. Existing exposure levels, represented by geometricmeans, already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in most operations at large non-ferrousfoundries. In two foundries OSHA recently visited, for example, geometricmean exposure levels are below 50   andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 11 of 15 operationsat one (Foundry F, Ex. 686A, p. 14) and in 6 of 11 operations at the other(Foundry E, Ex. 686A, p. 13). Unless otherwise stated, these geometricmeans include airborne lead from cross contamination (see discussion below).They therefore overstate exposure levels caused directly by individualoperations, because sampling results include cross contamination from otheroperations. The problem of cross contamination appears to affect all operationsand extends industry wide, even in modern plants (Exs. 582-81, 1980 Reporton Feasibility, p. 3). As OSHA demonstrates below, once the data are adjusted to factor out theeffects of cross contamination, geometric mean exposure levels are at orbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all but three operations at Foundry E. In thoseoperations the geometric means are not far above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarlyat Foundry F, adjusted exposure levels are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 13of 15 operations. In 1 of the remaining 2 operations the adjusted geometricmean is 78.7 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table A). At Central Brass Manufacturing Company (``Central Brass''), where the companypresident has fashioned rough, representative averages for each operationby eliminating atypical exposure results, a further adjustment (20 andCx.18;g/m\3\)\2\<NOTE/> to eliminate the effects of cross contamination reveals thatarithmetic average exposure levels would be at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in 6 of 9 operations (Ex. 581-4, Att. B-2, B-3, B-4). In 1 of the remaining3 operations the adjusted arithmetic average would be just slightly over50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.\3\<NOTE/> This confirms OSHA's understanding of exposure levels innon-ferrous foundries.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ OSHA chooses 20 andCx.18;g/m\3\ as the measure of crosscontamination at Central Brass, because that figure is just below the averageexposure level for coremaker in the three data sets upon which OSHA reliesto determine the extent of cross contamination in this industry sector(see Table A and the discussion of OSHA's use of exposure levels for coremakerto represent cross contamination, below). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A submission to the record by the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) concerning a NIOSH in-plant studyat Central Brass, which arrived too late for public comment and upon whichOSHA therefore does not rely, indicates that by January 1987, geometricmean exposure levels at Central Brass generally had been reduced to below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-11, ``Walk Through Survey Report of the CentralBrass Manufacturing Company,'' p. 4; and see cover letter from T. Meinhardtto OSHA Docket Office). OSHA's analysis of the data from Central Brass,including the adjustment for cross contamination, thus, appears to be conservative.Summary data for a number of foundries supplied by a major industry tradeassociation (Ex. 667) further confirm that in most operations geometricmean exposure levels adjusted for cross contamination already are below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.  <T3>The Data.</T3> The above overview of exposure levels is based uponthe best available evidence in the record. The record includes at least13 sets of data, most of which do not provide significant, useable data.OSHA believes that for purposes of determining technological feasibilitythe data sets representing exposure levels in large foundries are by farthe most useable, accurate and complete. In part, this is because someof these data sets are supplemented by vital contextual information gatheredon OSHA site visits. The data sets for large non-ferrous foundries were provided by FoundryE (Ex. 613b-1), Foundry F (Ex. 613b-6), Ford Meter Box (Exs. 582-81, 694-28,and 698), Central Brass (Ex. 581-4), and the American Foundrymen's Society,Inc. (``AFS,'' Ex. 667). These foundries provided OSHA with extensive andinvaluable data, information and insights. Except for the fact that theydeclined to testify and answer questions at the remand hearing, they werequite cooperative. Ford Meter Box was especially forthcoming. The best evidence is from Foundries E and F because their exposure dataare supplemented by extensive information on plant conditions, processes,and controls largely gathered on recent OSHA site visits (Exs. 684e; 684f).That information enables OSHA to assess and interpret these exposure datamore effectively than comparable data from other foundries, which havenot chosen to provide similar contextual information as requested. Theinformation and data from Foundries E and F further allows OSHA to betterunderstand exposure data from other large foundries, like those representedby AFS' data. Central Brass and to a lesser extent AFS made some commendableefforts to help OSHA interpret their data. Another group of data sets has been provided by small and medium-sizedfoundries. Those submitting data include Foundry G (Ex. 684G), AFS (Exs.667 and 694-26), Foundry 1 (Ex. 613b-5), Foundry 2 (Ex. 613b-4), Prattsville(Ex. 583-14 and see Ex. 694-23), Hill Air Force Base Non-Ferrous Foundry(Exs. 582-94; 649), Aacco Foundry, Inc. (Ex. 582-7), and Federal-MogulCorporation (Ex. 582-10). With the exception of the data from Foundry Gand Hill Air Force Base, all of these data are incomplete. Further, OSHA'sanalyses of these sets reveals that much of the data is neither recent,well-defined by job classifications or operations, nor accompanied by informationconcerning underlying conditions, processes or controls. For example, the submission from Federal-Mogul Corp. (Ex. 582-10), althoughreasonably complete in some respects, does not provide data operation byoperation. This is because in Federal-Mogul's foundry (identified in theexhibit as Plant C), the same operators both melt and pour the alloy. Inaddition, exposure data for other operations such as mold making are notprovided. Disaggregation of exposure data is useful and important in analyzingdata for purposes of assessing technological feasibility. Lack of disaggregationeffectively makes the data unuseable for comparing exposure levels in particularoperations and their associated controls, if any.The data set for small foundries provided by AFS is the best of this group.It consists of two submissions (Exs. 667; 694-26). In neither does AFSprovide individual monitoring results or explanations of conditions, processes,and controls associated with particular operations. AFS also does not explainhow it integrates exposure data from job classifications that vary widelyacross the industry into the five universal operations for which it providesdata. Obviously, the way in which raw data are allocated to particularoperations can influence results. In the initial data submission, the data for each of the five operationsconsist of nothing more than a single number, which represents the averageof arithmetic mean exposure levels in 25 foundries for that operation (Ex.667, p. 2). In the second submission (Ex. 694-26, Attachment 1), AFS doesprovide the frequency distribution of monitoring results and the arithmeticand geometric means for each of the five operations, but the data stillare not broken down foundry by foundry. This makes the data unreliablefor assessing technological feasibility, because, to an unknown extent,high monitoring results in one or more plants with poor controls may dramaticallyaffect the aggregate. Viewed together, these submissions are not only inadequate;they also appear to be inconsistent. For example, AFS does not explainwhy one job classification (centrifual casting) in the first submissionis dropped in the second or why average exposure levels for furnace tendingand cleaning/finishing are much higher in the second. Had AFS providedthe Agency with the underlying raw data, OSHA could have independentlyanalyzed the data. As such, OSHA does not rely on these submissions. Another data set is from Hill Air Force Base (Ex. 582-94). Even thoughthese data are quite complete and are supplemented by a recent OSHA sitevisit and even though this foundry has state-of-the-art engineering andwork practice controls and consistently achieves extremely low air leadlevels, OSHA does not generally rely on these data, because the Agencydoes not regard the foundry at Hill Air Force Base as typical. Its workforceis extremely small (only 2 workers); the level of production at the foundryis unusually low; and some processes and the alloys cast are not typicalof conventional non-ferrous foundries in the private sector (Tr. 848-49,859). The final data set is from Foundry G. OSHA also finds it cannot treat thesedata as typical of the non-ferrous foundry industry (Ex. 684g). The combinationof raw materials and processes at this foundry set it off from other foundries.For example, Foundry G does not rely upon preformulated alloy ingots butinstead makes up its own charge, relying heavily upon scrap. In addition,castings at this foundry are produced exclusively by continuous castingfor brass and bronze rods and from permanent molds for other products.Thus, Foundry G does not utilize any sand or sand substitutes for moldsor cores. In addition, the data from Foundry G are not useful for determiningfeasibility because, as Meridian points out, Foundry G lacks certain fundamentalcontrols and existing controls are inadequately designed (Ex. 686A, p.40). Further, exposure levels for several job categories are lacking. Another data set consists of inspection data from OSHA's Integrated ManagementInformation System (IMIS) (Ex. 583-1). This data set is supplemented withoften informative case files, which provide some of the contextual informationneeded to interpret and assess the data (Ex. 585). Gary E. Mosher, theindustrial hygienist for AFS, stated that this data set appears to reflectfoundries in which the lead content of metals being poured is fairly lowand therefore cannot be used to represent foundries that primarily andregularly pour brass and bronze with lead contents ranging from 5-22% (Ex.582-84, p. 5). Assuming, only for the purposes of argument, that Mr. Mosher's assertionis correct; more than one-half (675) of the total number (1,291) of non-ferrousfoundries are secondary and tertiary foundries, which primarily producecastings that are not brass, bronze or copper (Ex. 581-2, Comments of J.Mallory, p. 2). These foundries employ an estimated 38% of the industry'stotal lead-exposed workforce (Exs. 571, p. 13; 686A. p. 2). Therefore,even if OSHA were to agree with Mr. Mosher's assertion, at least for thislarge number of non-ferrous foundries and employees, the IMIS data canbe treated as representative. The IMIS data shows that more than 58% ofthe unadjusted sampling results already are below 50  andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex.583-1). Therefore, from the IMIS data OSHA concludes at the very leastthat in plants such as these, where leaded alloys are poured only intermittentlyand total lead emissions are lower than in primary foundries (which primarilyproduce brass, bronze or copper castings), controlling lead emissions toconsistently below 50  andCx.18;g/m\3\ should not pose any great difficulty.In any event, since OSHA concludes that it is feasible to control air leadlevels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by engineering and work practice controlsin primary foundries (see below), it must be feasible in secondary andtertiary foundries, as well, to control lead exposures to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Of the total number of non-ferrous foundries (1,291), 736 (56%) are small,employing fewer than 20 employees (Ex. 582-84, p. 1). Of these, it is estimatedthat more than one-half, or 366, primarily produce castings that are notbrass, bronze or copper. The remaining 370 small foundries, which primarilyproduce leaded alloys like brass and bronze, do have potentially high leadexposure levels in certain operations. However, it is estimated that thesefoundries employ only about 15% of the industry's total lead-exposed workforce(Exs. 571, p. 13; 686A, p. 2). By contrast, large foundries that primarily produce brass and bronze castingseach employ 20 or more employees and collectively account for almost one-halfof lead-exposed total employment (49%) (Ex. 686a, p. 6). These large foundriesare very important when considering exposure levels for the entire industryworkforce. Thus, the exposure level data from these foundries, which issummarized at the beginning of this section, merit further analysis. Unlessotherwise stated, the discussion of that data is in terms of geometricmeans. OSHA's analysis of the large foundry data provided by AFS reveals that64% of the unadjusted sampling results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and thatthe average geometric mean for all samples is 33.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 667).At Central Brass, more than two-thirds of the unadjusted sampling resultsare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 581-4, B-2, B-3, B-4). At Foundry E, alarge facility visited by OSHA in 1988, unadjusted geometric mean exposurelevels not only are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in most of the operations, butare below 80 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations (Ex. 686A, p. 13). At FoundryF, unadjusted geometric mean exposure levels are below 50  andCx.18;g/m\3\in over 73% of the operations, and are below 58 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in over 86%of the operations (Ex. 686A, p. 14). In addition, at Foundry F, in 11 of15 operations 50% or more of sampling results are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,and in an additional two operations close to a majority of sampling resultsare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In other words, at Foundry F there are only two operations in which eithera majority or close to a majority of samples are not already below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Those two operations, pouring and gate saw operator (cutoffsaw), also are the only operations at that foundry that have high geometricmeans. Although different foundries appear to have problems in differentoperations (e.g., charger), only the pouring and cutoff saw operationsuniformly present a problem in every data set where they appear (Exs. 686A,pp. 10, 11, 13 and 14; and 581-4-B, pp. 2-4). Therefore, OSHA concludesthat the pouring and cutoff saw operations are the most difficult to controlto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 684F, p. 12). In this discussion of exposure levels OSHA has relied to a considerableextent on the geometric mean to represent existing exposure levels andto provide the baseline for quantifying the reduction in exposure levelsanticipated from plants implementing OSHA's recommended additional controls.OSHA has chosen to rely upon the geometric mean because, as indicated abovein the introduction to the technological feasibility section of this preamble,it is widely accepted as the best statistic to characterize typical exposuredata (cite NIOSH). OSHA recognizes that there is no single number, or even range of numbers,that can perfectly characterize a data set. A mere range of exposure levels,for example, provides very little useful information about typical exposurelevels (e.g., 47 to 2,893 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for permanent mold furnace operatorat Foundry G, Ex. 684g, p. 8). Similarly, the arithmetic mean, which isequivalent to the commonly used ``average'', provides little insight intothe distribution of exposures and is subject to gross distortion by atypicalevents. For example, of the 15 sampling results for permanent mold furnace operatorat Foundry G, \3/4\ths are below 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ but the arithmetic meanis 345 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 684g, p. 10). This is because one sample is 2,893andCx.18;g/m\3\. By contrast, the geometric mean is 168.4 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex.686A, p. 15), which more accurately reflects the routine distribution ofexposure levels. In addition, OSHA finds the geometric mean to be particularly appropriateas a basis for assessing technological feasibility under the courts definitionof technological feasibility. The court does not require that for a PELto be feasible industry must be able to achieve it in all operations allof the time. Rather, the court s definition of feasibility focuses on typicaland routine exposure levels. <T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1270, 1272. Consequently, the mere existenceof aberrant exposure levels does not constitute proof of infeasibility.In using the geometric mean to characterize exposure data, the impact ofoutliers is minimized. This is necessary because there is no upper boundaryon high outliers, which can be in the thousands of mg/m\3\ while thereis a lower boundary on low outliers, the limits of detection or 0 mg/m\3\.As indicated in company annotations to exposure data and in company comments(e.g., Ex. 581-4, p. B-3), extremely high, atypical exposure levels oftenare the result of unusual events like operational upsets and spills ormonitoring problems, such as ``a piece of particulate getting into thesample'' (sample contamination) (Ex. 684E, p. 7). OSHA's use of the geometricmean to represent typical exposure levels is also supported by industryrepresentatives (e.g., Exs. 581-4-B, p. 4; 694-6, p. 2) and by Meridian(Ex. 686A, p. 12-13).OSHA therefore relies primarily on the geometric mean to characterize existingexposure levels. In addition, using a single figure rather than a rangeof figures (e.g., a frequency distribution) to represent existing exposuresfacilitates quantifying reductions in air lead levels to be expected fromthe implementation of recommended additional controls.Thus far, the analysis of large foundry sampling results is based uponunadjusted data that include the effects of cross contamination. OSHA isconvinced that cross contamination is a very serious problem in non-ferrousfoundries. This conclusion is supported by exposure data (see Table A,below). testimony of a union health scientist (Ex. 694-42, p. 4; Tr. 826,828), one of the few documented industrial hygiene surveys in the industry(Ex. 582-81, Letter from G. Mosher to R. Walther, p. 2), and statementsof industry representatives, Exs. 581-2, Testimony of J. Guimond, p. 13;667, p. 4).The clearest and most irrefutable evidence of cross contamination liesin the fact that coremakers, whose operation does not itself involve leador lead-contaminated sand, consistently have exposure levels across theindustry that average around 20 mg/m\3\, instead of being negligible, aswould be expected.For example, at Foundry E the geometric mean exposure level for coremakeris 27 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686A, p. 13). At Foundry F the geometric mean exposurelevel is 16.5 mg/m\3\, and more than 10% of the samples are above 50 mg/m\3\(Ex. 686A, p. 14). At the large foundries represented in the AFS data,the average geometric mean is 20.7 mg/m\3\, and more than 25% of the samplingresults exceed 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686A, p. 11). Although small foundries havenot provided sufficient data to enable OSHA to estimate exposure levelsfor coremakers, there is every reason to believe that, with fewer controlsand less-modern facilities in general, small foundries face cross contaminationproblems that are at least as serious (Ex. 686A, p. 41).Consequently, OSHA considers exposure levels in coremaking to representthe increment to exposure levels generally due to cross contamination inany given plant. Although the exposure level in coremaking and the derivedestimate of cross contamination varies from plant to plant, OSHA believesthat using levels in coremaking to represent cross contamination is conservative.Coremaking is often separated from high sources of lead emissions likecutoff saws, furnaces and pouring. For example, at both foundries E andF coremaking is separated by at least 50 feet and/or enclosures from suchoperations (Exs. 684e, p. 4; 684f, p. 4). This means that cross contaminationis likely to be less in coremaking than in operations closer to sourcesof high air lead levels (Ex. 667, p. 4).OSHA's position that exposure levels in coremaking represent the baselinefor background exposure levels in these foundries is supported by a statementby Dr. Franklin E. Mirer, an experienced, certified industrial hygienistand toxicologist, who is director of the Health and Safety Department forthe United Auto Workers Union (Ex. 694-42, p. 6). Dr. Mirer reported thatcoremaking ``does not itself generate lead emissions.''Record evidence confirms that cross contamination also is a problem inoperations other than coremaking. For example, in moldmaking, where theonly direct exposure to lead comes from any sand that has been recycledand remains contaminated, geometric mean exposure levels are 45.7 mg/m\3\,39.9 mg/m\3\, 27.4 mg/m\3\, and 35.8 mg/m\3\ at Foundry E, Foundry F, AFSfoundries (Table A, below), and Central Brass (Ex. 581-4), respectively.These levels, which average aproximately 38 mg/m\3\, cannot simply be attributedto contaminated sand, especially since some industry representatives assertthat lead-contaminated sand cannot cause exposure problems because of itsmoisture content (Ex. 689-3, p. 5). These levels, OSHA believes, confirmthat Agency's use of exposure levels in coremaking to represent the incrementattributable generally to cross contamination is conservative (Ex. 678).In addition, industry itself has recognized cross contamination as a problemin foundries. For example, in a July 1980 report on prevailing conditionsat Ford Meter Box based upon an on-site industrial hygiene survey carriedout by Gary Mosher, the industrial hygienist for AFS, Mr. Mosher recognizedcross contamination as a problem throughout the foundry. Otherwise praisingFord Meter Box's controls in the strongest terms_``no other brass foundryin the country * * * uses State-of-the Art technology as much or as effectivelyas Ford Meter Box'', Mr. Mosher nonetheless goes on to say that<ITAG tagnum="20">Smoke tube testing done in the foundry at the same time as the airsampling indicated that there seemed to be no uniform air flow patternsin the foundry. My guess is that with the negative pressure in the foundryand air blowing in through outside doors, windows and other parts of thebuilding, there is a great deal of turbulent air throughout the whole foundry.This turbulent air serves to mix all materials which are emitted by thevarious foundry processes. What this implies is that the sources are goingto have to be strictly controlled to eliminate the spreading of emissionsthroughout the foundry (Ex. 582-81, Letter from G. Mosher to R. Walther,p. 1).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Moreover, industry consultant Joseph A. Guimond of Joesph A. Guimondandamp; Associates, Inc., an environmental consulting firm that has specializedfor the past 14 years in controlling airborne contaminants in the foundryindustry, agrees that cross contamination is a major problem in the non-ferrousfoundry industry. Mr. Guimond has said that cross contamination ``has insome cases been the major contributor to employee overexposure based onour experience'' (Exs. 581-2, Prepared Testimony of J. Guimond, p. 14;666, p.13). Similarly, Richard A. Chandler, the president of Central Brass,states that for such operations throughout his foundry as molding, coremaking,mulling, general laborers, towmotor operators, sprue cutters, break-offand others, exposures basically are attributable to cross contamination(Ex. 581-4-B, p. 3 ).OSHA's position that cross contamination is an industry-wide problem isfurther supported by statements by OSHA's contractor, Meridian. Meridian'sdescription of typical non-ferrous foundries illuminates why cross contaminationis such a problem. These foundries are said to be generally housed in asingle building with a variety of sources of lead fume and dust that, ifuncontrolled, can release lead that can be spread throughout the plant(Ex. 571, p. ES 3).The impact on employee exposures to lead due to eliminating cross contaminationcan be established by a simple calculation. Taking exposure levels in thecoremaking operation as indicative of the extent of cross contamination,eliminating cross contamination would reduce exposure levels in most operationsat Foundries E and F and at the foundries represented by the AFS data by27 mg/m\3\, 16.5 mg/m \3\ and 20.7 mg/m\3\, respectively. However, in thecutoff saw and pouring operations, which are the primary sources of crosscontamination, the reductions would be proportionally less (see discussionbelow).As shown in Table A, this would mean that at Foundry E, for example, bycontrolling cross contamination only the cutoff saw operator, at 65.1 andCx.18;g/m\3\,the pourer, at 56.1 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the worker involved in sand treatment,at 50.6 andCx.18;g/m\3\, would have geometric mean exposure levels above50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. All other operations would have geometric means below40 andCx.18;g/m\3\. At Foundry F, the picture is similar. Only gate saw operatorsat 113.4 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and pourers at 78.7 andCx.18;g/m\3\ would have exposurelevels over 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\; all the other operations would have geometricmeans below 41 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table A). OSHA wishes to emphasize thatthese levels would be achieved without the implementation of other recommendedadditional controls. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s20,7.1,7.1,7.1,7.1,8,7.1 </C><T4>Table A </T4><H1>Job classification </H1><H1>Company E </H1><H2>Unadjusted geom. mean </H2><H2>Geom. mean adjusted for cross contamination </H2><H1>Company F  </H1><H2>Geom. mean </H2><H2>Geom. mean adjusted for cross contamination </H2><H1>AFS </H1><H2>Geom. mean </H2><H2>Geom. mean adjusted for cross contamination</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Coremaker <D>27 </D><D>0 </D><D>16.5 </D><D>0 </D><D>20.7</D><D> 0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Muller <D>35.6 </D><D>8.6</D><D/><D/><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Moldmaker <D>45.7 </D><D>18.7 </D><D>39.9 </D><D>23.4 </D><D>27.4 </D><D>6.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Melter <D>47.6 </D><D>20.6 </D><D/><D/><D>36.6 </D><D>15.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Furnace tender <D/><D/><D>50.9 </D><D>34.4 </D><D>68.8 </D><D>48.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Charger deck <D/><D/><D/><D/><D>153.7 </D><D>133 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hot metal dispatcher <D/><D/><D>33.9 </D><D>17.4</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pourer <D>69.6 </D><D>\1\ 56.1 </D><D>86.9 </D><D>\1\ 78.7 </D><D>83.3 </D><D>\1\ 72.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shakeout <D>61.7 </D><D>34.7 </D><D/><D/><D>88.9 </D><D>68.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wheelabrator/tumbleblast operator <D/><D/><D/><D/><D>128.3 </D><D>107.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cutoff/gate saw operator <D>78.6 </D><D>\1\ 65.1 </D><D>121.6 </D><D>\1\ 113.4 </D><D>112.7 </D><D>\1\ 102.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Grinder <D>21.7 </D><D>0 </D><D>57 </D><D>40.5 </D><D>18.3 </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cleaner/pangborn opr. <D>47 </D><D>\2\ 47 </D><D>46.2 </D><D>29.7</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sorter <D>65.3 </D><D>38.3 </D><D>38.5 </D><D>22</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sand treatment <D>77.6 </D><D>50.6</D><D/><D/><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inspector <D/><D/><D>20.6 </D><D>4.1</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Electrician <D/><D/><D>44.9 </D><D>28.4</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Millwright <D/><D/><D>33 </D><D>16.5</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Forklift-driver <D/><D/><D>32.3 </D><D>15.8</D><D/><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Laborer <D/><D/><D>26 </D><D>9.5 </D><D>33.5 </D><D>12.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisor <D/><D/><D>23.2 </D><D>6.7</D><D/><D> </D><F>\1\ Because this operation is itself one of the sources of cross contamination,OSHA has only reduced exposure levels in this operation by one-half ofOSHA's estimate of the increment due to cross contamination. </F><F>\2\ Operation located in separate building and it is extremely unlikelythis operation is affected by cross contamination from other operations,therefore OSHA has not reduced exposure levels in this operation by theestimate of the increment due to cross contamination.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Similarly, at Central Brass, adjusting for cross contamination resultsin exposure levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in almost all of the operations.Since Central Brass did not provide data on exposure levels in coremaking,OSHA has conservatively assumed the level to be 20 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Withthat assumption, simply controlling cross contamination would bring geometricmean exposure levels to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in seven of nine operationsat Central Brass (Ex. 581-4, B-2, B-3, B-4).\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ That 20 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is a conservative estimate for exposurelevels in coremaking is confirmed by the recent survey of Central Brassperformed by NIOSH (Ex. 582-11, pp. 4-5). In that survey, the geometricmean exposure level in coremaking for 1985-86 was 27.6 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Forother operations at Central Brass, nearly all of NIOSH's unadjusted geometricmeans exposure levels for 1985-86 were somewhat lower than OSHA's. Thisagain suggests OSHA is being conservative. As indicated above, OSHA doesnot rely on this NIOSH survey. <T3>Current Controls. </T3>OSHA's analysis of the record in the previoussection indicates that in the non-ferrous foundry industry the majorityof sampling results in nearly all the useable data sets already are ator below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and that in nearly all operations there are geometricmeans already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. This is true even beforeadjustments are made to eliminate the effects of cross contamination. Inonly two operations, pouring and cutoff saw, for example, were unadjustedgeometric mean exposure levels above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at both foundriesE and F. This level of control has been achieved primarily by existinglocal exhaust ventilation, enclosure or isolation, plant design, automationof the production process, and work practices. OSHA's best information on existing controls comes from its site visitsto foundries E, F and G and the technical literature. As to foundries Eand F, OSHA believes that, although the extent of controls implementedthere may exceed the industry norm, the controls are conventional in characterand readily available in the marketplace (see discussion below). The factthat both of these foundries allow representatives from other foundriesto visit and inspect their facilities confirms OSHA's belief that theircontrols are conventional (Exs. 684E, p. 7 and 684F, p. 12). As to FoundryG, which uses permanent mold and continuous casting, OSHA has concludedthat it is so atypical in its production processes and raw materials thatit cannot be taken to represent other foundries in the industry. Basedupon the information from foundries E and F, OSHA finds the following existingcontrols in the various operations.<T3>General Building. </T3>The production areas of both Foundries E andF are maintained at negative pressure to contain toxic substances in thoseareas. Both use mechanical, rather than natural ventilation. Foundry Fhas a central ventilation system, which maintains a minimal airflow throughoutthe building (Ex. 684f, p. 6). There are no windows in Foundry F, and themain access door is specially constructed to quickly and automaticallyraise and lower (Ex. 684f, p. 1). This minimizes cross currents and disruptionsto the ventilation envelope in the foundry. Foundry F is also computer controlled, which enables personnel in an isolatedand enclosed control room to know immediately when there is any malfunctionor problem in any area of the foundry (Ex. 694-25, p. 4). <T3>Moldmaking and Coremaking. </T3>At Foundry F, moldmaking is automated,which eliminates extensive employee contact with molding sand and therebymost employee exposures arising from the operation (Ex. 684f, p. 4). Consequently,exposure levels are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of the time (Ex. 684f,p. 7). At Foundry E, which produces sand molds with a jolt squeezer, exposurelevels are controlled to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by local exhaust ventilationinstalled at the sides of the moldmaking station, and sand that is nottrapped in the flask during the process falls into grates below (Ex. 684e,p. 4). The sand itself is conditioned with water, which suppresses mostof the respirable dust. Therefore, even where molds are made by hand, exposureto lead in the absence of cross contamination is typically low (Ex. 694-42,p. 7). Foundry F carries out coremaking in partial isolation, with coremakersseparated some distance from hot operations and surrounded on 3 sides bycurtains (Ex. 684f, pp. 4, 11). <T3>Furnaces. </T3>As described above, furnace operations involve 5 tasks:Charging, melting, tapping, drossing, and transferring molten metal. Exposurelevels are partly controlled at both Foundries E and F by locating thefurnaces on raised platforms. The selection of a suitable furnace is anothermethod of controlling exposure levels in these hot tasks. For example,the induction furnaces at Foundries E and F are energy efficient duringmelting and also have lower emission rates than either arc or reverberatoryfurnaces (Ex. 684e, p. 2). In addition, these furnaces are provided withtop-mounted exhaust systems equipped with air flow regulators to controlexposure levels by varying the amount of local exhaust ventilation duringparticular furnace operations. With regard to charging, the furnace at Foundry E has no charging enclosure(Ex. 684e, p. 4). To capture the release of lead fume during charging,the amount of exhaust in the close-capture furnace system is increasedfour-fold. Foundry E also has installed roof fans to remove fumes and heatthat escape during charging. These controls, however, are not adequatesince exposure levels of the melter are often well in excess of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 684e, p. 5). At Foundry E the OSHA site visit team observed a considerableamount of fumes coming from the furnace during charging and on two occasionsthe furnace operator was forced to leap back to get out of the way of sparksand fumes emanating from the furnace after charging (Ex. 684f, p. 11).At Foundry F, ventilation for the furnace is positioned over the chargingport of the furnace (Ex. 684f, p. 6). However, charging is not providedwith specific control equipment. During tapping at Foundry F, the furnace operator is supplied with a freshair shower of outside ambient air (Ex. 684f, p. 6). In addition, air leadlevels are controlled by Hawley Trav-L-Vents that exhaust fumes duringpouring of molten metal from the furnace to the portable vessels (e.g.,ladles, kettles, crucibles). During the site visit to Foundry F, OSHA observedthe furnace operator's breathing zone was within a few feet of the furnaceopening and he was manually chipping material out of the tap hole (Ex.684f, p. 11). At Foundry E, ladles are also equipped with Hawley Trav-L-Ventsystems to capture fumes during tapping and ladle transfer (Ex. 684e, p.6). During drossing, which at Foundry F takes place after the molten metalis tapped into a ladle, employee exposure is controlled by two means. First,while the employee is drossing he is bathed in a stream of outside airby an air wash system. Second, the ladle or kettle itself is equipped witha Hawley Trav-L-Vent (Ex. 684f, p 10). However, when the worker is requiredto rake dross off the top of the kettle, emissions that normally wouldbe captured and exhausted through the close-capture system are dispersedwhile the system is disconnected. At Foundry E, although the ladle is locallyexhausted, the worker drossing the ladle does not have a fresh air showernor is the slag bucket enclosed or ventilated (Ex. 684e, p. 6). At Foundry F, exposure levels during transfers of molten metal are controlled,except during transfer to the monorail siding, by a Hawley Trav-L-Ventsystem mounted on the ladle (Ex. 684f, pp. 6, 10). A similar set of controlsexists at Foundry E. However, the OSHA site visit team observed that whenthe worker pulled the ladle along the track too quickly, fumes from theladle escaped capture by the Hawley system (Ex. 684e, p. 2). Other foundriesfit transfer ladles with stainless steel or refractory hoods to containlead fumes during the transfer process (Ex. 586-18, p. 177). <T3>Pouring. </T3>At Foundry F, the pourer's exposure levels are controlledin several ways. The pourer, while pouring molten metal into molds on thecasting machine, is provided with a fresh air shower. In addition, a portableventilation system may continue to exhaust the kettle from which the metalis poured. The casting machine itself is ventilated by a single-slot ventilationsystem positioned 8 to 12 inches over it (Ex. 684f, pp. 6, 10). At FoundryE, each mold pouring station is equipped with a side draft ventilationsystem (Ex. 684e, p. 6).<T3>Shakeout.</T3> At both Foundries E and F, cooling and shakeout arepartially or fully enclosed and isolated. At Foundry F, in the shakeoutoperation the equipment is fully enclosed, exhaust-ventilated, and designedto operate unattended (Ex. 684f, p. 3). The plant has been designed toisolate the cooling court and shakeout area below the foundry floor tocontain lead emissions. At Foundry E, cooling and shakeout are partiallyisolated under the floor and the shakeout machine is equipped with localexhaust ventilation. At Foundry E, however, the shakeout conveyor is neithercovered nor ventilated (Ex. 684e, p. 6). <T3>Cleaning and Finishing.</T3> At Foundries E and F, the methods usedto control employee exposures in cleaning and finishing are basically similar,consisting of isolation, raised platforms, local exhaust ventilation, freshair showers and replacing sawing and cutting with kiss-gating. Cleaning and finishing operations at foundries E and F are separated fromthe hot operations by either distance or barriers. Foundry E has locatedits cleaning and finishing operations some distance from the furnace area,and these operations receive one-third of the foundry's fresh makeup air.At Foundry F, a canvas curtain separates cleaning and finishing from thefurnace and pouring areas. At foundries E and F, cleaning and finishing operations are located onplatforms elevated several feet off the foundry floor (Exs. 684e, p. 4;684f, p. 4). The elevated platforms permit the foundries to utilize gravitationalforce to separate the employees from the lead dust which accumulates andfalls to the foundry floor during cutting and grinding. At Foundry F, theplatform floor is grated to further facilitate this separation. The first step in cleaning and finishing, separating individual castingsand cutting off sprues, gates, and risers, is accomplished with abrasivesaws. Both foundries E and F to some extent have replaced cutting withkiss-gating (Exs. 684c, p. 3; 684f, p. 10). From the viewpoint of exposurecontrol, kiss-gating itself is a control. Kiss-gating removes excess metalby a mechanical press that does not generate high velocity dust. Wherekiss-gating is used, often it is not necessary for the casting to be groundor polished, a process that entails additional lead exposure. In additionto switching to kiss-gating, some foundries are designing casting moldsso that excess metal may be simply broken off by hand. Where these techniquesare not used, excess metal must be removed from a casting by cutoff sawsor other means. These cutoff saws operate at high speed and disperse leadeddust at a velocity and in a stream of air that is difficult to capture.At Foundry F, kiss-gating is being used to the maximum extent possibleto reduce cutting. Where cutting is still required (i.e., large and unusually-shapedcastings), stationary cutoff saws are sometimes partially enclosed andusually equipped with ventilation over the saw and down-draft ventilationthrough a single slot on the saw table. In addition, the cutoff saw operatoris provided with a fresh air shower to remove or dilute dust in the operator'sbreathing zone (Ex. 684f, p. 10). At Company E, cutoff saws are equippedwith ventilation that encloses the blade of the saw. Ventilation is alsosupplied in the blade-slot area below the saw table and behind the cuttingblade (Ex. 684e, p. 6). Elsewhere in the industry, foundries may use burningrather than abrasive cutting for certain castings. This produces higherexposure levels than cutting. Where castings require grinding and polishing, local exhaust ventilationhas been installed over the grinding surface at Foundry E. At Foundry F,grinding stations are equipped with ventilated covers and downdraft ventilation.<T3>Sand Handling.</T3> At both foundries E and F molding sand is treatedto remove large lead particles before it is used again. At Foundry E, usedsand is treated for reuse and disposal in a ventilated basement area isolatedfrom other process operations (Ex. 684e, p. 6). The sand recovery systemat Foundry F is automated. Sand from the the mold machines and other areasof the plant is conveyed to the recovery area where it is put through twoscreening systems to remove lead and other contaminants before reuse (Ex.684f, p. 11). <T3>Work Practices.</T3> The major work practice control used by both foundriesE and F is routine housekeeping. Neither Foundry E or F has installed acentral vacuum system. At Foundry E, twice daily a worker with a HEPA-filtered portable vacuumcleans up the dust generated throughout the foundry. Each worker also isresponsible for cleaning his own work station. Nevertheless, the OSHA sitevisit team observed dust on floors and work surfaces at Foundry E, especiallyin the vicinity of moldmaking and pouring. The site visit team also observedbrooms at several work stations (Ex. 684e, p. 6). Representatives from Foundry F state that housekeeping is also performedseveral times a day at their foundry using shovels, brooms and mobile HEPA-filteredvacuums. In addition, the night shift maintenance crew uses a forklift-mountedvacuum system. Nevertheless, during its site visit, OSHA observed considerabledust buildup on stairs, railings, floors and work stations and observedthe automated moldmaking machine operators using brooms rather than vacuumsto sweep excess sand that had fallen to the floor in the vicinity of themachine (Ex. 684f, p. 12). In addition to daily housekeeping, Foundry E vacuum cleans the entire facility,including the rafters, on an annual basis. At Foundry F, a similar completeplant cleanup has not been conducted since the summer of 1986.<T3>Additional Controls. </T3> With the existing controls described inthe previous section, OSHA has found that the majority of sampling resultsin the data sets upon which OSHA has relied already are at or below 50mg/m\3\ and that in nearly all operations the geometric mean already isat or below 50 mg/m\3\ in one or more plants. These results were obtainedwithout adjusting the data to eliminate the effects of cross contamination.In only two operations (pouring and cutoff saw) are unadjusted geometricmean exposure levels above 50 mg/m\3\ at both foundries E and F (See TablesB and C, respectively, below). In a third operation, charging, some plantsalso have problems.With the additional controls recommended by OSHA implemented and crosscontamination controlled, OSHA anticipates that geometric mean exposurelevels in all operations at Foundry E and in all but one operation at FoundryF will be at or below 50 mg/m\3\. Indeed, OSHA expects that the geometricmean exposures in 19 of 26 job categories in these two foundries will bebelow 30 mg/m\3\ after additional controls are implemented and cross contaminationis controlled.OSHA believes that for operations where most sampling results or the geometricmeans already are below 50 mg/m\3\, relatively modest improvements in controls,such as improved housekeeping or better preventive maintenance (e.g., installingbaffles to stop cross drafts or covering dross buckets), will be sufficientto reduce air lead levels of employees consistently below 50 mg/m\3\. Similarly,for operations where most of the sampling results or geometric means arebelow 100 mg/m\3\, OSHA believes that a combination of limited additionaland improved controls (e.g., improving the efficiency of the ventilationsystem), will be sufficient to control exposure levels to 50 mg/m\3\.On the whole, the same sorts of controls that have been successfully utilizedto achieve exposure levels at or below 50 mg/m\3\ at foundries E and Fand elsewhere are precisely the kinds of additional controls that OSHArecommends to reduce remaining excess air lead levels to or below 50 mg/m\3\.The controls are local exhaust ventilation, enclosure and isolation, plantdesign, automation built into the production process, and work practices.The Agency's discussion of the reductions of air lead levels expected tobe achieved by implementing recommended controls relies in part on assessmentsmade by a panel of three certified industrial hygienists established byOSHA's contractor, Meridian (Ex. 686A, pp. 19-25). The panel's assessmentsare based upon data in the record; site visits to Foundries E, F, and G;and the members' extensive experience and expertise as industrial hygienists.Although quantification of the estimated reductions involves a substantialamount of expert judgment, OSHA believes that the panel's assessment isthe best available evidence in the record on the reduction in exposurelevels that can be reasonably expected from implementing recommended additionaland improved controls. However, while OSHA places substantial relianceupon Meridian as one among several bases for the Agency's feasibility determination,OSHA in its own analysis places greater emphasis than Meridian does onthe problem of controlling cross contamination to reduce air lead levelsto 50 mg/m\3\ in non-ferrous foundries.<T3>Prevention of Cross Contamination and Cross Drafts. </T3>As OSHA establishedin its analysis of cross contamination in the section on exposure levels,cross contamination appears to be a foundry-wide and industry-wide problem(see Table A above). For foundries that primarily produce leaded brassand bronze alloys, OSHA has conservatively estimated that exposure levelsin coremaking represent the increment to exposure levels generally dueto cross contamination in each plant. From its analysis, OSHA concludesthat it is technologically feasible to eliminate cross contamination.There are two main reasons for this cross contamination. First, foundrieshave failed to adequately contain lead exposures at their primary source.Second, cross drafts exist, which disperse throughout the foundry the escapinglead fume and dust.These cross drafts occur for a variety of reasons. For example, windowsor doors left open, use of man-cooling fans, and reliance upon naturalventilation with seasonal variation, especially in open plants, all createcross drafts (e.g., Ex. 582-81, Letter from G. Mosher to R. Walther). Concerningthe problem caused by man-cooling fans, Mr. Mosher stated in an 1980 industrialhygiene report to Ford Meter Box, ``If there is one point I would liketo stress * * * it is all man cooling fans in the foundry should be removed''(Ex. 582-81, Letter from G. Mosher to R Walther, p. 3). However, even inplants that have eliminated these obvious sources of cross drafts, crossdrafts still can be produced by air transfers between hot and cold operationsand imbalances in the mechanical ventilation system.Not only do these cross drafts spread contamination from one operationto another, they also disturb the airflow of local exhaust ventilation,preventing exhaust hoods from operating effectively. OSHA's evaluationof the complex, plant-wide problems that cross drafts create is substantiatedby the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' book,<T3>Industrial Ventilation,</T3> which states that ``[c]ross drafts notonly interfere with the proper operation of exhaust hoods, but also maydisperse contaminated air from one section of the building into anotherand can interfere with the proper operation of process equipment'' (Ex.583-13, p. 7-2).OSHA assumes that air lead levels outside of plants generally are at leastas low as required by the EPA, which limits ambient air lead levels to1.5 mg/m\3\, averaged over one quarter of a year (Ex. 601, p. 10). However,because this limit represents a quarterly average, there may be daily excursionsto levels as high as 10 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 601, p. 10). In addition, the freshair supply may be contaminated by exhausted foundry air. Recirculatingthat air into the foundry will increase exposure levels in any foundrywhere makeup air quality is not maintained or where natural ventilationis used (Ex. 582-81, Letter from G. Mosher to R. Walther, pp. 1-2). Insuch cases, the makeup air supply constitutes another source of potentialcross contamination, and without a filtration system workers' exposureto lead can never be lower than the concentration of lead in the supplyair.To the extent that these problems may exist at any foundry, foundries shouldexercise care to assure that supply air is not contaminated by greaterthan negligible levels of lead. Controlling this sort of contaminationis very straight forward. All lead in the supply air should be removedby appropriate control methods (e.g., filtration) before delivery intothe foundry. To remedy the problem of cross contamination, as well as others, OSHA believesthat the very first thing that non-ferrous foundries should do is to obtainthe services of an experienced industrial hygienist to perform a foundry-wideindustrial hygiene study that focuses on a task-by-task analysis of sourcesof exposure and analyzes cross drafts and cross contamination as a basisfor designing cross draft barriers and other measures to eliminate them.Each foundry should undertake this kind of study in accordance with therequirements of paragraph (e)(3) of the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025),which requires employers to establish and implement written complianceprograms. OSHA is confident that such a study is essential to systematically controlair lead levels in this industry. This is a precondition for employersinstituting an effective, regular program to identify the precise sourcesof exposure and reasons for upset conditions in order to determine howbest to reduce them to a minimum (Ex. 686A, pp. 40-41). The level of industrialhygiene understanding in foundries, especially at foundries F and G, isinadequate, according to Meridian. Meridian has further stated that it``can think of no control measure as likely to produce dramatic resultsas the relatively low-cost approach of obtaining the services of an industrialhygienist'' (Ex. 686A, p. 41). OSHA's conclusion that such a study is needed is supported by Mr. KnowltonCaplan, a well-known engineering consultant to the lead industry. Mr. Caplanhas said that engineering controls should be designed with industrial hygieneproblems in mind (Ex. 582-89, Appendix). There appear to have been no recent attempts at foundries E and F to evaluatethe significance of cross drafts or cross contamination on employee exposuresto lead (Exs. 684e; 684f, respectively). Company representatives of FoundryF stated that there is no industrial hygienist on staff and that the companyhas not attempted to interpret its background sampling results (Ex. 684f,p. 13). Similarly, representatives of Foundry E stated that they do notemploy an industrial hygienist, nor have they performed a recent task analysisor attempted to correlate background lead levels with employee exposurelevels (Ex. 684e, p. 7). The only industrial hygiene study during the past10 years that is documented in the remand record was carried out in 1980at Ford Meter Box, prior to the installation of substantial additionalcontrols at that facility. No similar industrial hygiene evaluation hasbeen carried out since then to analyze the effectiveness of those controls.OSHA believes that consultation with an industrial hygienist would helpto resolve such problems inexpensively. Based upon its criticism of theinadequate expertise brought to bear to control exposure levels and ofthe poor quality of design of engineering controls recently installed infoundries, AFS might well agree with this point (Ex. 689-3, p. 1; see alsoKenneth E. Robinson, ``Eight Fallacies in Plant Air Handling,'' Exs. 689-7and 689-13C, p. 56). Foundries appear recently to have spent considerablesums of money for engineering controls that they could have known wereunsuitable and inadequate. To control cross contamination simple steps may be effective. For example,at Foundry F, which is one of the more sophisticated foundries in the industry,the coremaking operation, which uses no lead or lead-contaminated materials,is cross contaminated. This is true despite the fact that the operationis separated from the furnace and pouring areas by some distance and bycanvas curtains on three sides (Ex. 684F, p. 11). OSHA believes there arefour likely factors contributing to this cross contamination. First, theoperation is not enclosed on all sides. Second, the enclosure does notextend to the ceiling. Third, forklift trucks travel by the open side entrainingand spreading lead dust from other operations. Fourth, a man-cooling fan,located at the edge of the open side and facing in, directs presumablycontaminated air into the operation. OSHA believes that controlling thesesources of cross contamination probably would require little more thancompleting the enclosure and providing some source of uncontaminated air.Several other operations are much closer to these sources and therefore,everything else being equal, are likely to suffer higher levels of crosscontamination. Erecting cross draft barriers at proper locations and assuring that windowsand doors operate in a way to minimize airflow, as Foundry F has done (Ex.684f), not only will decrease cross contamination, but also will increasethe efficiency of exhaust hoods. High exposure levels in a particular workarea also may be effectively contained within that area by maintainingthe area under slightly higher negative pressure than surrounding areas.Once contained, emissions then must be captured. These measures will resultin an appreciable reduction in air lead levels in all areas, as sourcesof lead extraneous to an operation are eliminated and control of sourcesof lead intrinsic to an operation is enhanced. If preventing cross contamination is one of the most important steps thatcan be taken to reduce exposure levels generally throughout the non-ferrousfoundry industry, other conventional controls that are applicable to manyoperations also should be implemented to broadly reduce exposure levels.Implementation of effective conventional controls already has dramaticallyreduced exposure levels in various operations throughout the industry (Exs.582-11, 586-18, 583-13, 689-13 A and C, 689-3, and 689-4). These conventionalcontrols include better ventilation, enclosure, isolation, housekeeping,and maintenance.<T3>Ventilation. </T3>The presence of excessive lead in the work environmentsof non-ferrous foundries is proof that existing engineering controls likelocal exhaust ventilation (LEV) and general ventilation are not doing thejob. Although much more quantitative and other information than industryhas provided would be needed to state with any precision how great a reductionof any particular exposure level could be achieved by enhancing specificventilation systems, OSHA has no doubt that in many operations improvedor additional ventilation can achieve major reductions in worker exposure.Such controls have been developed, tested, and where found effective, manufacturedand applied widely for many years throughout industry to control specificcontaminants. Conventional controls for nearly every operation in foundrieshave been described in detail and often depicted in photographs or diagramsby industrial hygienists and engineers from the American Conference ofGovernmental Industrial Hygienists (Ex. 583-13, pp. 5-4 to 5-20, 5-41,5-48 to 5-60), AFS (Exs. 689-3; 689-4), NIOSH (Ex. 645), American NationalStandards Institute (Exs. 689-13A, 13B, 13C), and many consultants thathave worked for OSHA or industry (Exs. 689-6; 689-7; 689-8; 689-9; 689-10;689-11; 689-12).Improved or additional ventilation can achieve major reductions in airlead levels at Ford Meter Box, for example, where in the furnace operationthe capacity of the ventilation system fails to meet the AFS criteria foreffective exhaust (Exs. 689-3, p. 26 and 689-4D, fig. 19). Specifically,at Ford Meter Box's melting rate of 1.5 tons per hour, a technical committeeof AFS has recommended that ventilation at furnace openings be at least12,500 CFM at all times. This is 25% above the 10,000 CFM currently usedfor charging, and dramatically above the 2,500 CFM used during meltingat Foundry E (Ex. 582-81, p. 5). Based upon AFS' analysis, OSHA anticipatesthat increasing ventilation capacity to satisfy AFS criteria should resultin nearly total capture of emissions by any appropriate hood.At Foundry F, the ventilation system in general may be adequately designed,but it is not balanced properly. Foundry F appears to have an insufficientsupply of makeup air, which means there is not enough makeup air to compensatefor exhausted air. This is effectively conceded by the foundry's owner(Ex. 694-25, p. 4) and was manifest on OSHA's site visit in the fact thatexcessive negative pressure created by the imbalance kept doors from operatingnormally.As the <T3>Foundry Ventilation Manual, </T3>written by a technical committee ofthe AFS, makes clear, this condition is prevalent throughout the industry(Ex. 689-3, pp. 67-68). From this manual it appears that ventilation systemsoften have been installed in foundries with little or no attention to therequirement of replenishing the exhausted air. As a result, capture velocitiesare likely to have been decreased and the removal of contaminants probablyhas been substantially reduced or even eliminated under extreme conditionsof air starvation. AFS recommends that increasing the volume of makeupair to the appropriate level should improve the efficiency of exhaust ventilationby at least 5-10% (Ex. 689-3, p. 68, fig. 7-2).Thus, it is imperative that improvements to existing ventilation and newly-installedventilation be properly designed and installed. Many previously-installedventilation systems, according to AFS' manual, appear to have been ineffective:<ITAG tagnum="21">Recognizing that the expertise required to properly design a ventilationsystem was not present on their staffs, foundry owners have increasinglyutilized the services of engineering firms to accomplish this task. Manytimes such firms are not familiar with foundry processes, resulting inmany ventilation systems being designed and installed which cannot provideproper control. Many designers follow commercial specifications which haveno application in the industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Without proper knowledge of specifications or data, engineering firmsor equipment suppliers are seriously handicapped in providing good industrialequipment. The result is that the equipment and systems fail to providethe desired control and may not meet local, state and/or Federal codes.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Ex. 689-3, p.1).Improvements to ventilation systems can substantially reduce exposure levels.At Hill Air Force Base foundry, for example, a properly selected, designed,and installed control system has resulted in a decrease in air lead levelsof 86% (from 50 mg/m\3\ to 7 mg/m\3\; Ex. 582-94). This system consistsof up-draft ventilation primarily aimed at controlling fumes, the baseof which is a ventilated grate and the top of which is a swiveling hoodand telescopic ducts, which can accommodate various ladle sizes (Ex. 649).This system also can be operated in a down-draft mode to capture heavylead particles, for example, in the shakeout operation.<T3>Enclosure and Isolation. </T3>Enclosure and isolation are two alternativemethods of separating workers from air contaminants. In the case of isolation,the employee is physically separated from contaminants in the air; e.g.,by working in a filtered, ventilated control booth (Ex. 689-4D, fig. 32).With enclosure, the source of the contaminant is physically contained andseparated from the rest of the work environment to prevent contaminationof the air. Docket entries describe standard enclosure techniques that are in use inthe industry or can be readily implemented (e.g., enclosing casting operations;Ex. 590, p. 22). Simple isolation techniques that have been successfullyused in certain plants in this and other lead industries are applicablethroughout this industry (e.g., providing employees with filtered-air,ventilated cabs for mobile equipment, fresh air islands, isolation boothsand control rooms; Ex. 689-4D, p. 7-14, figs. 31, 32). Isolating workers even for a portion of their shift can significantly reduceexposure levels. For example, a Radian study of a secondary lead smelterdemonstrates that employee exposures can be reduced by 23-77% even whenemployees spend only a portion of the workday in an isolation booth (Ex.583-16, p. 30. Another study, by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH), investigating the effectiveness of various controltechnologies in secondary lead smelters, reports that workers spendingeven one-quarter of their time in a supplied air island would experiencea 20% reduction in their 8-hour TWA exposure levels (Ex. 590, p. 40). Consequently,fresh air islands could be installed for operators near the furnace (e.g.,charging) to reduce remaining excess exposures after other controls areimplemented. <T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices, and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices, and preventive maintenance are critically important controlswhose importance frequently is not adequately recognized by employers.Failure to develop and use rigorous housekeeping, good work practices,and preventive maintenance can destroy the effectiveness of otherwise adequateengineering controls. The importance of housekeeping measures in general was stressed in a reportprepared by the Cadre Corporation for a secondary copper smelter (Ex. 475-32D,p. 58). The Cadre report states,<ITAG tagnum="21">[Housekeeping] is definitely the most underrated aspect of any fumeabatement program. In any industrial facility there will be some amountof particulate in the air. Sooner or later this particulate is going tosettle out on the plant floor, equipment and materials. If this dust isnot collected and disposed of then it will become airborne again due tobuilding drafts, mobile machinery traffic and numerous other disturbances.The housekeeping component of the abatement plan is a vital link in thesuccess of the project. By neglecting to properly control settled particulateany gains made by capturing fugitive emissions will be minimal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 58). </ITAG>OSHA agrees. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of good housekeepingand work practices. It only takes a small amount of lead dispersed throughouta building's air space to raise the airborne level over the PEL. Housekeepingin non-ferrous foundries needs to be improved. For example, at Foundry F, which is offered by industry representativesas an exemplary operation, the last wall-to-wall cleaning was conductedmore than 18 months prior to OSHA's site visit in February of 1988 (Ex.684f. p. 12). Each non-ferrous foundry should thoroughly clean its entirefacility, including rafters, at least annually (Ex. 609, pp. 15-16). AtFoundry F, the site visit team also observed considerable dust buildupon stairs, railings, floors and at workstations (e.g., grinding and cutoff).Moreover, Foundry F continues to rely on dry sweeping in some operations(Ex. 684f, p. 12), which is prohibited under the lead standard except wherevacuuming and other equally effective methods have been tried and foundineffective (29 CFR 1910.1025 (h)(2)(ii)). This prompted Meridian to recommendprohibition of dry sweeping and increased frequency of vacuuming and plant-widecleaning. Meridian estimated that such straight-forward improvements inhousekeeping as these could be expected to reduce worker exposures in generalby 10-25% (Ex. 686a, p. 22). Detailed housekeeping instructions should be prepared, in accordance withthe requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of the lead standard (29 CFR1910.1025), and adherence to them enforced by employers, with schedulingand checkoff of regular cleaning of all areas of the plant where dust cancollect. If necessary, housekeeping instructions should list individualsites, pieces of equipment, parts of equipment, and obscure corners (e.g.,under conveyors) to assure that they are cleaned regularly. Implementing appropriate work practice controls is also vital to achievingexposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Engineering controls oftencan only be as effective as the associated work practices that determinehow they are used and where the employee locates himself relative to thecontrols. For example, if the enclosed and ventilated crucible is movedtoo quickly to the molding area, fumes are removed from the capture rangeof the hood (Ex. 684e, p. 2). OSHA finds this work practice unacceptable.Employers should ensure that the crucible is moved in a manner that doesnot defeat the ventilation system (Ex. 686a, p. 20). Work practices also should be written to prescribe correct procedures forall tasks that might result in increased employee exposure. Such proceduresshould dictate, for example, that an employee remove himself from proximityto a source of exposure whenever possible and, to the extent possible,isolate himself from contaminants in a fresh-air island or the like. Similarly,the dumping of dross in open bins should be prohibited. Care also shouldbe taken to assure, whenever possible, that covers or exhaust hoods arekept on ladles and other lead-emitting vessels filled with molten metal(Ex. 586-18). OSHA also notes the importance of maintenance programs to assure that allsystems function as cleanly and as efficiently as practicable. For example,as stated in AFS' publications, (Ex. 689-3, p. 74, Table 8-1; and see <T3>Safety in Metal Casting, </T3>Des Plaines, IL, Vol. 6, 1970, p. 172),the needed control capacity for ventilation systems to protect air qualitydepends not only on proper design and installation, but also on propermaintenance and availability of sufficient makeup air. Exhaust systemslose their capacity because belts and pulleys slip, duct branches becomeclogged, duct couplings become loose and develop holes that leak air, filtersbecome occluded, and fan blades become corroded or unbalanced. Thus, theeffectiveness of engineering controls can be severely limited by poor maintenance.Before discussing in detail OSHA's recommended additional controls operationby operation, a simple exercise suggests that implementing additional controlsin a non-ferrous foundry to control exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is straightforward. Looking at the unadjusted data from foundries E andF, it is apparent that one or the other of the foundries already controlsexposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations but two(pourer and cutoff/gate saw operator; see Table B, above). As a result,if Foundry E were to adopt the controls of Foundry F for operations inwhich Foundry F has achieved levels below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and FoundryF were to do the same for operations in which Foundry E has achieved levelsbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, geometric mean exposure levels would be below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations except pouring and cutoff. For example, at Foundry E personal sampling results in shakeout and sandtreatment are 61.7 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 77 6 andCx.18;g/m\3\, respectively.By contrast, at Foundry F both of those operations have been enclosed andfully automated, with the result that no employee is exposed to lead ineither operation (Ex. 684f, pp. 3-4).On the other hand, for grinders at Foundry F geometric mean exposure levelsare 57 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table C), while at Foundry E they are 21.7 andCx.18;g/m\3\(see Table B). In 1980, Foundry E had an arithmetic mean exposure levelof approximately 90 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in grinding, because local exhaust ventilationwas inadequate (citation omitted to protect confidentiality). Since thattime, Foundry E has redesigned the dust hoods over grinders and increasedcapture velocity, thereby reducing exposure levels to well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Currently, exhaust ventilation in grinding at Foundry F appears to be inadequate.Members of the site visit team at Foundry F observed dust escaping thecapture system. In addition, the site visit team observed considerabledust buildup on stairs, railings and floors in this work area, which confirmsthat current ventilation is not capturing all emissions (Ex. 684f, p. 12).Using the sorts of controls Foundry E has instituted, Foundry F shouldhave no problem achieving similar results. Thus, a simple exchange of appropriate technology between the two foundriesis likely to reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in nearlyall operations at both foundries. These results could be achieved evenbefore cross contamination is effectively controlled and before any otheradditional controls are implemented in specific operations. In additionto the above controls, OSHA specifically recommends additional controlsoperation by operation. <T3>Cutoff Saw.</T3> The cutoff saw operation is the source of some ofthe highest exposure levels in non-ferrous foundries and is probably themost difficult area to control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Indeed, although OSHAbelieves that significant reductions in exposure levels can be achieved,the Agency recognizes that in some plants in this single operation 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\may not be consistently achievable. Exposure levels exceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the cutoff saw operation primarilybecause leaded dust is ejected from the saw at a high velocity. To capturethis dust requires that dust hoods or enclosures be well-designed to handlevarious kinds of castings and local ventilation systems have adequate exhaustvolume (cfm) (Exs. 583-13, pp. 5-41; 689-3, p. 62, figs. 6-7). OSHA believesthat if the additional controls recommended below by the Agency and bythe expert panel of certified industrial hygienists brought together byMeridian are implemented, exposure levels in the cutoff saw operation willapproach 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The cutoff saw operation, which is one of the two major sources of crosscontamination in the industry, contributes substantially to total crosscontamination. However, this exposure is experienced by the cutoff sawoperator as direct exposure from his own operation, not as cross contamination.As a result, simply controlling cross contamination will not reduce theseexposures for the operator. Controlling cross contamination will reducethe operators' exposures from the second substantial source of cross contamination,pouring, as well as from other operations. For purposes of analysis, OSHAassumes that one half of all cross contamination originates in the pouringoperation. Consequently, the level of cross contamination included in thecutoff saw operators' exposure levels should be at least one-half of thetotal increment attributed to cross contamination. For the cutoff saw operation at Foundry F, the expert panel recommendsinstalling additional slots to improve down-draft ventilation and additionalhoods over the blade (Ex. 686A, p. 21). The panel also recommends thatboth foundries E and F use wet suppression. These controls, the panel estimates,will reduce worker exposure levels at Foundry F by 75-95% and at FoundryE by 25% (Ex. 686A, pp. 20-21). When these reductions are applied (OSHAconservatively estimates a 75% reduction at Foundry F) and after adjustingfor cross contamination, OSHA anticipates that geometric mean exposurelevels will be 49 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at Foundry E and 28 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at FoundryF (see Tables B and C, below). In addition, in accordance with the manual prepared by a technical committeeof AFS, OSHA also recommends installing a booth-type enclosure for theabrasive cutoff operation with a minimum of open area at the face of theenclosure where cutting should be performed (Ex. 689-3, pp. 51-52, 62).This should certainly further reduce exposure levels to the cutoff sawoperator and the potential for cross contamination from this operationas well. <T3>Pouring.</T3> Pouring is an operation in which exposure levels canbe reduced below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Before considering the installationof new controls in pouring, it is imperative that foundries perform industrialhygiene surveys to systematically assess the sources of their exposureproblems and the effectiveness of current controls. OSHA believes thatsuch surveys will confirm that there are two major problems with existingcontrols. The first is that in pouring and other operations the capacitiesof the ventilation systems in place are inadequate. Second, controls thathave been installed not infrequently have proven to be inadequate becauseof a lack of industrial hygiene analysis prior to installation and/or failureto assess the effectiveness of such controls after installation. For example, at Ford Meter Box's modern foundry, where the unadjusted geometricmean exposure level in pouring already is quite low (69.6 andCx.18;g/m\3\),the increase in production in recent years appears to have seriously taxedthe capacity of the foundry's ventilation system (Ex. 582-81). Existingventilation, including a Hawley close-capture system over the crucibleand some side-draft ventilation at the pouring station, obviously is nolonger adequate. Data and comments from Ford Meter Box suggest that production has outrunventilation capacity. These documents indicate, for example, that whenthe foundry first installed side-draft ventilation at pouring operationsin 1980, exposure levels were reduced by at least 24%-40%. However, thereafter,as production rose by two-thirds between 1980 to 1987, exposure levelsrose to above the levels that preexisted installation of these controls.This strongly suggests that production has exceeded the capacity of thesystem. Indeed Ford Meter Box itself admits it has exceeded the capacityof the system (Ex. 582-81, pp. 22-26, 29). Data from the first quarterof 1988 indicate that this situation has worsened (Ex. 698, p. 1).Thus, there is obvious room for improvement in the ventilation system evenbefore considering the installation of other controls. OSHA has no doubtthat by increasing the capacity of the ventilation system, Ford Meter Boxcan reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in pouring. Like Ford Meter Box, Foundry F, where the geometric mean exposure levelin pouring is 86.9 andCx.18;g/m\3\, also needs to increase the capture velocityof its local exhaust and to increase the number of ventilation slots. Withthis modification alone, the expert panel estimates that unadjusted exposurelevels can be reduced by about 25% (Ex. 686A, p. 21). The primary obstacle in effectively controlling exposure levels in pouringthrough local exhaust ventilation is that, while the molten metal is beingpoured, it emits fume that rises vertically into or near the breathingzone of the operator. However, exhaust ventilation cannot easily be placeddirectly over the mold, where it would be most effective, because thatwould interfere with pouring itself (but see, Ex. 649). Nevertheless, OSHAbelieves that substantial reduction in exposure levels can be achieved,for example, by installing the kinds of side or compensating hoods depictedin the AFS's manual, <T3>Foundry Environmental Control </T3>(Ex. 689-4-D, figs. 1, 13, 29).This side-draft ventilation is not positioned perpendicular to the floorbeside the mold, as is conventional, but is angled so that it does reachout over the mold without interfering with pouring. Such a configuration,according to the caption beneath figure 13 in the AFS manual, would removeall fume and smoke emitted during pouring. Foundry F is typical of the industry in its failure to take advantage ofindustrial hygiene expertise in assessing exposure problems, designingsolutions, and monitoring the effectiveness of newly-installed controls.For example, the foundry installed fresh air stations in the pouring operation(Ex. 684f, p. 10), without knowing in advance what all the sources of exposurewere and without knowing afterwards how effective the new controls were(e.g., Ex. 689-7, p. 2). Implementing other controls will further reduce exposure levels. For example,Foundry F should institute an annual wall-to-wall cleaning of the facility,the last one having been conducted in the summer of 1986 (Ex. 684f, p.12). In addition, routine housekeeping also should be improved, to removethe dust observed by the OSHA site visit team in various operations throughoutthe plant and to maintain all surfaces as clean as practicable, as requiredby the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025(h)(1)). Controlling cross contaminationwill also reduce air lead levels in pouring. The pouring operation, which is one of the two major sources of cross contaminationin the industry, contributes substantially to total cross contamination.However, this exposure is experienced by the pourer as direct exposurefrom his own operation, not as cross contamination. As a result, simplycontrolling cross contamination will not reduce these exposures for thepourer. Controlling cross contamination will reduce the pourers' exposuresfrom the second substantial source of cross contamination, the cutoff saw,as well as from other operations. For purposes of analysis, OSHA assumesthat one-half of all cross contamination originates outside of pouringoperation. Consequently, the level of cross contamination included in thepourers' exposure levels should be approximately one-half of the totalincrement attributed to cross contamination. When the expert panel's recommended controls are implemented, the panelestimates worker exposure levels in pouring will be reduced by 32% at FoundryF (Ex. 686A, p. 21) and by 27-37% at Foundry E (Ex. 686A, p. 20). Whenthese reductions are applied and after adjusting for cross contamination,OSHA anticipates that the range of geometric mean exposure levels willbe 35-41 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at Foundry E and 53.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at Foundry F(see Tables B and C, below). Moreover, these estimated resulting exposurelevels do not reflect all anticipated reductions (e.g., reductions anticipatedfrom improved housekeeping, which the expert panel estimated could reduceoverall exposure by 10-25% at Foundry F). <T3>Charging. </T3>The only other operation that may require substantialcontrols to reach 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is furnace charger. The exposure datafor workers performing this operation are quite limited and somewhat confusing.Neither Foundry E nor Foundry F have a separate job category called charger.OSHA therefore assumes charging is one of the tasks performed by employeesclassified in other job categories that already are or can be controlledto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In foundries where charging constitutes aseparate job classification, exposure levels in charging, like pouring,appear to vary directly with production levels.There are two aspects to controlling exposure levels in charging. The firstentails controlling the source of fume and dust released from the furnaceduring charging. Uncaptured emissions constitute a source of exposure tothe charger and, via cross contamination, to workers in other operations.The second entails isolating the charger and modifying the charger's workpractices to minimize resulting exposures. With regard to the first aspect, the ventilation system must be well designedand its capacity must be adequate to capture emissions at prevailing andanticipated production levels (Ex. 689-3, p. 26). When the demands of higherproduction exceed the capacity of the ventilation system, large amountsof fume and dust will escape and employee exposure levels will rise. For example, in 1980 at Ford Meter Box, when ventilation capacity was notobviously exceeded by the demands of production, exposure levels for chargingranged between 84.8 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 95.8 andCx.18;g/m\3\. However, in 1987,with increased production, the average exposure level was 164 andCx.18;g/m\3\.These recent exposure levels are evidence that, with increased levels ofproduction, the furnace operation is not adequately controlled and thecharger, who works in close proximity to fume and dust, is not adequatelyprotected. According to Ford Meter Box, the only controls relevant to this operationare general plant ventilation, roof fans and a close capture ventilationsystem on the furnace. There appears to be no specific control directedat charging itself. OSHA believes that, aside from the obvious need toincrease the capacity of the ventilation system at Ford Meter Box, a numberof other readily available controls can be implemented to reduce exposurelevels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in charging. These controls, whichmust be predicated upon an industrial hygiene survey to assess the foundry'sparticular conditions and be designed with health considerations in mind,should include enclosure of the charging port (Exs. 649; 689-3, p. 29,Fig. 3-4, p. 31, Fig. 3-6; 689-4D, Figs. 8, 10), isolation of workers onthe charging deck in a fresh air pulpit (Ex. 689-4D, Fig. 32), and useof remote controls for delivering the charge to the furnace (Ex. 689-4D,Fig. 32). OSHA believes that operations other than cutoff saw, pouring and chargingeither already are controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or are so closeto that level that only the following, relatively modest improvments and/oradditional controls may be needed. <T3>Moldmaking. </T3>In moldmaking at foundries E and F, geometric meanexposure levels, unadjusted for cross contamination, already are below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Once cross contamination is controlled, exposure levelsfor this operation in both foundries should be below 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (seeTable B, below). The sole remaining source of lead in this operation islead-contaminated, recycled sand. OSHA believes that more effective removalof lead from the recycled sand will further reduce exposure levels. In addition, Meridian recommends reducing the fall distance for moldingsand (e.g., flexible fall chutes), reducing drop distance for spillage,enclosing the sand dispensing operation, and providing three-sided slotventilated enclosures to control dust from excess spillage. These combinedcontrols recommended by Meridian are estimated by Meridian to reduce exposurelevels by between 75-95%, which would maintain exposure levels well below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in moldmaking (Ex. 686A, p. 19). <T3>Furnaces. </T3>In addition to the controls recommended above (e.g.,increase in ventilation capacity where it is too low for current levelsof production), which should reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in the furnace area in general and in charging specifically, limited additionalcontrols should reduce exposure levels consistently to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\for employees engaged in other furnace tasks: melting, tapping, drossing,and transferring molten metal (see Tables B and C, below). For example, by providing an exhaust hood equipped with a swiveling telescopicduct and employing push-pull ventilation (Ex. 649), Hill Air Force Basereduced exposure levels by as much as 86%, to well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 582-94). The controls were successful in that small foundry in accommodatingdifferent-sized ladles as well as in controlling emissions during charging,tapping and drossing. The up-draft ventilated grates were successful inconfining fumes generated from spills of molten metal or dross. At Hill,roof fans were completely eliminated and replaced with mechanical ventilationfor providing sufficient make-up air. The location of the furnace was selectedin a fashion that wind drafts from the access doors would not interferewith the function of the mechanical ventilation (Exs. 582-94; 649). Alternatively to implementing controls appropriate to mobile operations,foundries can perform these operations at fixed stations with improvedlocal exhaust (Exs. 689-4D, Fig. 24; 686A, pp. 19-22). For example, installingside-draft slot ventilation at the slag bucket is expected to reduce exposurelevels to the worker performing drossing by 20-30% at Foundry E (Ex. 686A,p. 20). In addition, placing a lid on the slag bucket while tramp elementsand compounds cool will further reduce exposure levels. Such control ofemissions at their source will reduce exposure levels at other work stationscaused by cross contamination from the furnace, as well. <T3>Shakeout Operations. </T3>At Foundry F, the shakeout operation is automated,fully enclosed and exhausted. This has eliminated workers' exposures tolead in shakeout. OSHA supports this approach to controls as the most effectivein the industry. Even at Foundry E, where partially enclosed shakeout equipmentis employed, the unadjusted geometric mean exposure level already is 61.7andCx.18;g/m\3\ (see Table B, below). OSHA recommends that Foundry E installa push-pull exhaust system, combining an adjustable hood mounted over anair supply (e.g., from a grate), which should reduce prevailing exposurelevels by 5-25% (Ex. 686A, p. 20; and see Ex. 649)). In combination withcontrolling for cross contamination, these controls are anticipated toreduce exposure levels to well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<T3>Finishing.</T3> Finishing consists primarily of cutting and grinding.OSHA has discussed the cutoff saw operation above. In grinding, unadjustedgeometric mean exposure levels already are at 21.7 andCx.18;g/m\3\ at FoundryE and 57 mg/m\3\ in Foundry F. OSHA has determined that increasing thecapacity of exhaust systems for grinders, particularly by supplying freshmakeup air to the work stations, is the most effective way to reduce exposurelevels to consistently below 50 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 684e, p. 7).<T3>Sandhandling.</T3> OSHA has determined that controlling exposure levelsto or below 50 mg/m\3\ in sandhandling is not a problem. At Foundry F,where sandhandling is basically automated, enclosed and locally exhausted,sandhandling is effectively controlled. At Foundry E, exposure data coveringthe last half of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987 indicate that controllingexposures to or below 50 mg/m\3\ also should be relatively easy. The foursampling results are 37 mg/m\3\, 51 mg/m\3\, 59 mg/m\3\ and 327 mg/m\3\(citation omitted to protect confidentiality). OSHA believes the finaldata point represents an aberration due either to upset conditions or samplingerror (e.g., ``a piece of particulate getting into the sample.'' Ex. 684e,p. 7). OSHA therefore concludes that exposure levels in sandhandling alreadyare at or near 50 mg/m\3\. Moreover, OSHA believes that current exposurelevels in sandhandling at Foundry E are likely to be lower than 1986 monitoringresults suggest, because a new baghouse was added in 1987 (Ex. 684e, p.6).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,4.1,6.1,9.1</C><T4>Table B._</T4><T4>Company E</T4><H1>Job classification</H1><H1> Unadjusted geometric mean</H1><H1>Geometric mean after recommended adjustment for cross contamination</H1><H1>Geometric mean after recommended additional controls are applied andafter adjustment for cross contamination</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Muller<D>35.6</D><D>8.6</D><D>\1\ 8.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coremaker<D>27</D><D>_</D><D>_</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Moldmaker<D>45.7</D><D>18.7</D><D>1.0-4.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Melter<D>47.6</D><D>20.6</D><D>17.1-19.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pourer<D>69.6</D><D>\2\ 56.1</D><D>35.3-41.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shakeout<D>61.7</D><D>34.7</D><D>26.0-33.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cutoff<D>78.6</D><D>\2\ 65.1</D><D>48.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Grinder<D>21.7</D><D>(\4\)</D><D>(\4\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sorter<D>65.3</D><D>38.3</D><D>1.9-9.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sand treatment<D>77.6</D><D>50.6</D><D>\1\ 50.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cleaner<D>47.0</D><D>\3\ 47</D><D>\1\ 47</D><F>\1\ No additional controls were recommended for this job classificationby the expert panel of certified industrial hygienists.</F><F>\2\ Because this operation is itself one of the sources of cross contamination,OSHA has only reduced exposure levels in this operation by one-half ofOSHA's estimate of the increment due to cross contamination.</F><F>\3\ Operation located in separate building and it is extremely unlikelythis operation is affected by cross contamination from other operations.Therefore, OSHA has not reduced exposure levels in this operation by theestimate of the increment due to cross contamination.</F><F>\4\ Negligible.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,4.1,6.1,9.1</C><T4>Table C._Company F</T4><H1>Job classification</H1><H1>Unadjusted geometric mean</H1><H1>Geometric mean after adjustment for cross contamination</H1><H1> Geometric mean after recommended additional controls are applied andafter adjustment for cross contamination</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Coremaker<D>16.5</D><D>_</D><D>_</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Moldmaker<D>39.9</D><D>23.4</D><D>\1\ 23.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Furnace tender<D>50.9</D><D>34.4</D><D>\1\ 34.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hot metal dispatcher<D>33.9</D><D>17.4</D><D>\1\ 17.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pourer<D>86.9</D><D>\2\ 78.7</D><D>\1\ 53.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cutoff<D>121.6</D><D>\3\ 30.4</D><D>\1\ 22.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Grinder<D>57</D><D>42.8</D><D>26.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pangborn<D>46.2</D><D>39.3</D><D>22.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sorter<D>38.5</D><D>22</D><D>\1\ 22 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inspector<D>20.6</D><D>4.1</D><D>\1\ 4.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Electrician<D>44.9</D><D>28.4</D><D>\1\ 28.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Millwright<D>33</D><D>16.5</D><D>\1\ 16.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Forklift driver<D>32.3</D><D>15.8</D><D>\1\ 15.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Laborer<D>26</D><D>9.5</D><D>\1\ 9.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisor<D>23.2</D><D>6.7</D><D>\1\ 6.7</D><F>\1\ No additional controls were recommended for this job classificationby the expert panel of certified industrial hygienists.</F><F>\2\ Because this operation is itself one of the sources of cross contamination,OSHA has only reduced exposure leve!s in this operation by one-half ofOSHA's estimate of the increment due to cross contamination.</F><F>\3\ OSHA has estimated this conservatively.</F></ITAG></ITAG><T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusions. </T3>Based on the above analysisof the evidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, theAgency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementingreadily available engineering and work practice controls is technologicallyfeasible in the non-ferrous foundry industry as a whole. Nevertheless, the Agency recognizes that in some plants in the cutoff sawand pouring operations it may not be possible to consistently achieve the50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL by these controls. Since OSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\PEL feasible for the industry, employers will be required in the cutoffsaw and pouring operations, as well, to implement engineering and workpractice controls to control exposure levels to the PEL or the lowest feasiblelevel. Where all feasible engineering and work practice controls have beenimplemented and employees operating the cut off saw or performing pouringare still exposed above the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL as an 8-hour TWA, employerswill be required to provide these workers with respirators for supplementalprotection while they are operating the cutoff saw and performing pouring.To summarize, OSHA has shown the following. In the non-ferrous foundryindustry the majority of useable sampling results already are at or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and in nearly all operations geometric mean exposurelevels at Foundry E or F (or both) already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.At foundries E and F a mere exchange of appropriate technology betweenthe two foundries may be all that is necessary to bring nearly every operationat these foundries to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Exs. 684e; 684f; see TablesB and C, above). These results can be achieved even before other additionalcontrols are implemented and before cross contamination is controlled.After additional controls recommended by OSHA are implemented and crosscontamination is effectively controlled, OSHA anticipates that geometricmean exposure levels in both foundries E and F will be at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in nearly all operations. Indeed, in 19 of 26 job categories in these twofoundries, exposure levels are anticipated to be below 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In addition, in two other foundries, one studied by NIOSH (Ex. 582-11,Att.), upon which OSHA does not rely, and the other reported in a peer-reviewedarticle in the <T3>Americian Industrial Hygiene Journal </T3>(Ex. 586-18), exposure levelsalso appear to have been controlled to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA also wishes to point out that all of its recommendations for achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ rely exclusively upon conventional and readily availablecontrols. OSHA has not needed to exercise its statutory authority to forcethe development of new technology in this industry to justify its findingof feasibility. Based on the foregoing OSHA believes that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achieveablemost of the time in most of the operations in non-ferrous foundries. Inreaching this conclusion, OSHA does not purport to have recommended anexhaustive list of additional controls. The Agency is certain that industrywill be capable of devising and fine-tuning various controls to furtherreduce exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA anticipates that industry willbe able to consistently achieve exposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in nearly every phase of production. OSHA acknowledges that the lead standard is strict and believes that toachieve the PEL requires implementing an integrated system of controls.The basic element in that system is an industrial hygiene study. Each foundryshould have an experienced industrial hygienist perform an in-depth job/taskanalysis and a plant-wide survey. This survey and analysis should identifysources of emission in each task, sources of cross drafts or cross contamination,and appropriate sites for erecting cross contamination barriers. Such ananalysis should also recommend appropriate engineering and work practicecontrols to reduce emissions and minimize employee exposures. If, afterimplementing these recommendations, reductions in air lead levels deviatesubstantially from what was anticipated a follow-up industrial hygienesurvey should be conducted and necessary corrections made. The second element in that system is the development of good, written housekeepingand work practice programs that are systematically implemented so thatproper procedures are routinely and meticulously followed. For example,wall-to-wall cleanups should be conducted at least annually. The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean and efficientcondition. The non-ferrous foundry industry does not agree that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is achieveable. Industry's disagreement is based on four main, and othersecondary arguments. The four main arguments are: Foundries E and F, which embody state-of-the-art technology, have not beenable to consistently achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Exs. 582-81, letter fromG. Mosher to R. Walther, p. 4, and Jacko report; 684f, pp. 12-13; 694-28,pp. 9-10); Foundries E and F, upon which OSHA has relied heavily in makingthis feasibility determination, are not representative of the non-ferrousfoundry industry (<T3>CITE</T3>); OSHA's reliance on geometric means in assessing technologicalfeasibility is inappropriate (Ex. 694-28, pp. 1-8); and the efforts ofMeridian and its expert panel of certified industrial hygienists are biased,incompetent, and unsupportable (Exs. 694-26, pp. 2-8; 694-28, pp. 6-9).First, industry argues that several foundries with state of the art technology,including Foundries E and F, have been unable to consistently achieve 50andCx.18;g/m\3\. While OSHA concedes that these foundries have extensivecontrols and are not consistently achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operations,the Agency does not agree that they have not been, or are unable to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA also maintains that, despite the characterizationof these foundries as ``state-of-the-art,'' there are further controlsand improvements that can be implemented there. For example, both foundriesE and F need to improve the effectiveness of their current ventilationsystems. Nonetheless, OSHA has shown that at Foundry F geometric mean exposure levelsand 50% or more of the sampling results already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in 11 of 15 operations. At Foundry E, geometric mean exposure levels alreadyare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 6 of 11 operations. OSHA also has shown thatby effectively controlling cross contamination and implementing the sortsof additional controls OSHA recommends, geometric mean exposure levelsare anticipated to be reduced to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in all operationsat Foundry E and in all but one operation at Foundry F. In addition, inover 73% of the combined operations at these two foundries exposure levelsare anticipated to be below the action level of the lead standard (30 andCx.18;g/m\3\).The reason that foundries E and F are not achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ nearlyall the time is not because they have reached the limits of technologicalfeasibility. Rather, it is because after these foundries implemented whatat the time may well have been state-of-the-art technology, they did nottake steps necessary to maintain their foundries at that level. For example, while Foundry E in 1980 may have had effective controls atthen prevailing production levels, it has not since then made adequatemodifications and improvements to those controls, especially includingincreasing its ventilation capacity to keep pace with increases in production.In addition, there is no indication in Foundry E's recent comments thatit has effectively resolved certain other problems pointed out as longago as 1980 by Mr. Mosher (citation omitted to protect confidentiality).Thus, Foundry E has not taken effective action to control cross contamination,and there is no indication in the record that it has dealt with the potentiallyserious problem of lead-contaminated exhaust air being recycled by externalwind currents through open doors and windows back into the foundry.Furthermore, within at least the last 8 years apparently neither FoundryE nor F has conducted the kind of industrial hygiene survey of plant conditionsthat OSHA considers to be the foundation of an integrated, state-of-the-artcontrol program capable of consistently achieving the strict PEL of thelead standard. At Foundry F, for example, within 18 months of opening itsnew state-of-the-art plant, it decided that further controls were neededin the pouring area. Without consulting an industrial hygienist, FoundryF installed several fresh air showers to deal with the problem. Monitoringresults before and after installing these showers do not indicate any noticeablereduction in air lead levels, which remain excessive (Ex. 613B-6). Nonetheless,Foundry F still has not employed an industrial hygienist to assess theseresults. Consequently, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry's argument that FoundriesE and F, with their ``state-of-the-art'' technology, have been unable toachieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and that therefore the PEL is unachieveable byengineering and work practice controls. Second, industry argues that Foundries E and F are not representative ofthe industry, which is comprised of unique plants, many of which are small,and most of which are less well controlled than these two foundries. Inresponse, OSHA wishes to emphasize that the fact that foundries E and Fmay have more controls than most other foundries does not preclude OSHAfrom relying upon them for purposes of making its determination about technologicalfeasibility. On the contrary, the fact that these foundries have been ableto achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in so many operations through conventionalmethods is the best evidence of technological feasibility. So, the factthat the level of controls at Foundries E and F may be higher than elsewherein the industry does not in itself make them unrepresentative on the issueof technological feasibility. The ultimate determination of technological feasibility depends not uponthe level of control that may be currently typical in an industry, butrather upon the level of control of which the industry is capable. Indeed,the court has stated that to prove technological feasibility OSHA neednot prove that the controls needed to achieve a PEL have already been successfullyimplemented in any plant in the industry. OSHA need only prove a reasonablepossibility that a typical firm will be able to develop and install engineeringand work practice controls that can meet the PEL. <T3>USWA</T3> v. <T3>Marshall</T3>, 647 F. 2d at 1272. Consequently, the relevant issue in this regard is only whether the diversitywithin the non-ferrous foundry industry somehow technologically precludesthe controls implemented at Foundries E and F from being adopted and adaptedby other typical plants, which may be smaller or have other distinguishingcharacteristics. While recognizing this diversity, OSHA believes the controlsat Foundries E and F can be implemented, with appropriate adaptation, bytypical foundries in the industry. The controls used in both Foundries E and F are conventional, and as indicatedabove, OSHA's recommendations to further reduce exposure levels also relyexclusively upon conventional controls. These readily available controlsare predicated upon widely accepted general principles of industrial hygiene.Of course, as in most industries, controls that have been implemented inone plant may have to be somewhat modified to adapt them to particularconditions in other plants. However, OSHA does not accept the propositionthat there is anything so unique about the non-ferrous foundry industryor anything inherent in the relevant controls that would impede or precludesuch adaptation by typical plants. Foundry E, for example, is a captivefoundry that produces a wide range of castings, some in low volume. Inthis respect, most small foundries, which run special jobs in low volume,are similar to Foundry E. Third, industry argues that OSHA's reliance in its technological feasibilityassessment on the concept of the geometric mean is inappropriate. OSHAdisagrees primarily for the reasons previously set out. Industry's maincriticism of the use of the geometric mean is that showing that an industrycan achieve geometric means below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is insufficient to provetechnological feasibility, unless OSHA can prove industry is capable ofachieving geometric means far below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ so that industry isguaranteed that it can achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ all or nearly all the time.OSHA agrees in part with this point but believes that industry has misunderstoodhow geometric means are being used in the Agency's feasibility determination.However, Meridian may have used the geometric mean, OSHA wishes to emphasizethat, while the Agency certainly has relied upon the geometric mean toassess feasibility in non-ferrous foundries, it has not treated the factthat the industry may already be achieving a geometric mean of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\as tantamount to a proof of technological feasibility. Rather, the Agency'sposition is that a geometric mean of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ indicates that somecontrols are in place to limit excessive worker exposures or that exposurelevels are low to begin with and that only relatively modest further additionsand improvements to controls are necessary to consistently reduce exposurelevels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Industry further argues that if the Agency uses a geometric mean it shouldrecalculate the geometric mean to three standard deviations from the meanto provide ``a reasonable level of assurance'' of compliance (Ex. 694-28,pp. 1-8). By reasonable assurance, industry means that statistically morethan 998 out of every 1,000 samples would be at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.However, as the courts have said, to prove the technological feasibilityof a PEL, OSHA is not required to prove that an industry can achieve thePEL in all of the operations all of the time. <T3>USWA</T3> v. <T3>Marshall</T3>, 647 F. 2d at 1270. Indeed, if a PEL is generally feasibleacross an industry, there may still be operations in which the PEL cannever be achieved and in which industry's obligation is to engineer downto the lowest feasible level. In that case, fulfilling this obligationconstitutes compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard (29 CFR1910.1025). For example, suppose hypothetically that exposure levels for employeesin 9 of 10 operations in a particular industry can always be controlledbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Suppose further that exposure levels for employeesin the single remaining operation can never be controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Despite the fact that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is clearly feasible in 9 of 10 operations,if all employees are sampled at the same frequency and if the same numberof employees work in each operation, 10% of the sampling results will alwaysexceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA, nonetheless, would conclude that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is technologically feasible for that industry, even though it is infeasiblein that operation. The Agency believes that the fact that exposure levelsfor a minority of workers cannot be controlled as effectively as exposurelevels for the majority is no reason to forego protection to the extentfeasible for the majority. Even if, for purposes of argument only, OSHA were to accept the notionthat feasibility entails some statistically anticipated level of minimumassured compliance and assuming the exposure data were good enough to supportsuch analysis, the Agency, as a matter of policy, would set that minimumconsiderably lower than industry suggests. OSHA believes that industry'sminimum of 998 out of 1,000 samples, which is virtually all the time inall operations, is in conflict with the court's opinion that to prove technologicalfeasibility OSHA does not have to prove the PEL can be achieved in alloperations all of the time. OSHA further believes that if industry's interpretationwere to prevail it would effectively subvert OSHA's statutory mission toprotect workers to the extent feasible.Moreover, again for purposes of argument only, if OSHA accepted industry'ssuggestion that for a PEL to be technologically feasible a geometric meanwell below 50 would be required to provide the necessary assurance of compliance,the Agency would still conclude that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologicallyfeasible in the non-ferrous foundry industry. As indicated at the beginningof this section, OSHA anticipates that after its recommended controls areimplemented at foundries E and F geometric mean exposure levels in over95% of the combined job categories are anticipated to be well below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\. In fact, over 73% are anticipated to be below 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\(see Tables B and C, above). Finally in this regard, industry argues that, instead of relying on geometricmeans, OSHA should eliminate what the Agency considers to be outlying datapoints and use arithmetic means (Ex. 694-28, p. 1). Industry seems to favorthis substitution because it believes geometric means are lower than arithmeticmeans. OSHA cannot accept this suggestion in this rulemaking. OSHA believesindustry's alternative would require OSHA to make highly subjective judgmentsconcerning what constitutes an outlier. By contrast, the geometric meanis a statistic derived from an objective mathematical formula that resultsin appropriately de-emphasizing outliers and reflects typical exposurelevels. The way OSHA uses geometric means in this rulemaking is widelyaccepted in the scientific community. Industry itself often uses geometricmeans in comparable ways. Fourth, industry has devoted considerable effort in written comments andin cross examination at the hearing to impugning the competence and integrityof OSHA's contractor, Meridian, and the expert panel of certified industrialhygienists established by Meridian (e.g., Ex. 694-26, pp. 5-6, 9, 12).On the whole, OSHA rejects these criticisms and believes that Meridiandid a creditable job given time and resource constraints. Meridian has had extensive experience and possesses very broad competencein the area of industrial hygiene, the principles of which are universallyapplicable to all industries. It also has expertise and has broad experiencein assessing factors relevant to technological feasibility. Physically,there is nothing unique about lead dust and lead fume or about non-ferrousfoundries that would make Meridian's extensive expertise and competencein evaluating engineering and work practice controls across many industriesirrelevant to this industry. The control technologies recommended are conventionaland transferrable from similar industries, and the anticipated effectivenessof these controls in reducing air lead levels also is the same across industries.Meridian's final report (Ex. 686A) and its conclusions are based on numeroussources in the record. These include data, other evidence, and commentssubmitted by foundries, unions, trade associations and other interestedparties; site visits to three foundries, participated in by two experiencedcertified industrial hygienists; and recommendations by an expert panelof three experienced certified industrial hygienists, two of whom had beenon all the site visits. The industrial hygienist on the panel who did notgo on site visits had previously had extensive experience in non-ferrousfoundries (Ex. 609, pp. 1-2). Of course, notwithstanding their experience and expertise, Meridian andthe expert panel may have drawn some incorrect conclusions and made certainmistakes of fact. This is almost inevitable when a contractor can devoteonly limited time and resources to examining a complex industry and a voluminousrecord. Such mistakes are more likely to occur where, as in the case ofthe non-ferrous foundry industry in this rulemaking, an industry declinesto testify and to subject itself to any questioning at the public hearing.Thus, OSHA concludes that Meridian's revisions and its conclusions generallyare firmly grounded in the record. In any event, OSHA has independentlyassessed the record, reviewed Meridian's final report for accuracy, takenaccount of industry's comments on that report, and relied only in partupon the Meridian report for the Agency's feasibility determination. In addition to its main criticisms, industry makes a number of other arguments,all of which the Agency has carefully considered and four of which areimportant enough to deal with individually. Industry argues that day-to-dayvariability of exposure levels within a foundry makes it impossible toachieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, on a regular basis; that 50 cannot be achievedin foundries E and F or in other foundries without rebuilding (Exs. 582-81,p. 33; 694-25, p. 6); that recycled lead-bearing sand, which contaminatesseveral operations, is so abrasive that equipment to permanently encloseor automatically convey it will have a short life expectancy, and thattask analysis cannot be usefully performed because of low exposure levelsand short exposure times. With regard to the variability argument, OSHA recognizes that some variabilityin exposure levels above or below an average level does occur over time.However, much of this variability is due to factors that are identifiableand frequently within the control of the employer, such as poor work practices,inadequate housekeeping and upset conditions (Exs. 686A, p. 40; 694-42,p. 8). In addition, at least one foundry has conceded for example, thata certain percentage of sampling results that seem to suggest variabilityis instead the product of contamination of the sampling device by largestray lead particles (Ex. 684e, p. 7). OSHA strongly believes that if production and engineering and work practicecontrols are properly and consistently carried out, the factors causingvariability will be largely controlled and the range of variability willbe very narrow. OSHA therefore considers evidence of repeated, wide-rangingvariability in exposure levels as evidence of the inadequacy of controls.That inadequacy, of course, hardly constitutes evidence of infeasibility.Once the range of variability has been narrowed by effective controls,the degree of latitude for variability that is built into OSHA's determinationthat the PEL is feasible should prove sufficient. This latitude is implicitin OSHA's conclusion that in most operations foundries will be able toreduce exposures to levels that are reasonably below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.However, OSHA understands that from time to time peak exposures due tounforeseeable upsets or other aberrational events will exceed the latitudefor variability. The Agency takes account of that possibility in its enforcementpolicy (FOM). As a result, OSHA does not believe that such excursions arerelevant to its feasibility determination. Second, industry argues that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved in FoundriesE and F or in other foundries without rebuilding (Exs. 582-81, p. 33; 694-25,p. 6). OSHA has already shown that the PEL can be achieved most of thetime in most of the operations at Foundries E and F through the mere exchangeof technology currently employed and without rebuilding. As to the otherplants that are said to require rebuilding, industry has not presentedany evidence to support that assertion. The main argument of industry inthis regard seems to be that Foundries E and F have effectively implementedall the controls that can be implemented in their existing plants. OSHAhas already shown this assertion to be incorrect as well. The analogousargument that most other foundries cannot do more within their existingplants is not only unsupported by documentation, but also inherently suspectgiven the apparently low level or poor quality of engineering controlsin most small foundries (Ex. 689-3, p. 1). On the other hand, OSHA doesrecognize that some foundries may require extensive capital improvementsif they are to achieve the PEL. Third, industry argues that recycled lead-bearing sand, which contaminatesseveral operations, is so abrasive that equipment to permanently encloseor automatically convey it will have a short life expectancy. Althoughthe record is devoid of evidence concerning the life expectancy of suchequipment. OSHA doubts industry's position. Covered screw conveyors aretypical material handling methods for sand. Specifically, it is perfectlyapparent that sand handling can be permanently enclosed and automaticallyconveyed since Foundry F has already done so (Ex. 684f, App. A). FoundryF says nothing regarding equipment problems arising from the abrasivenessof sand. Consequently, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry arguments. Based upon itsown expertise, experience and the record evidence. OSHA concludes thata PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible by means of engineeringand work practice controls in the non-ferrous foundry industry. <T3>Uses. </T3>The non-ferrous foundry industry produces a wide range ofcast products for various uses. Castings may be quite small (electricalconnectors weighing less than an ounce) or very large (such as an 80,000pound ship's propeller) [Ex. 582-84, p. 1]. Other types of castings includebushings, bearings, valves, and fittings [Ex. 571, p. 8]. Castings areused extensively as components in equipment such as military hardware,electric power generation and distribution systems, mining machinery, andplumbing ware [Ex. 475-3A, p. 1] as well as in applications such as bathroomfixtures, furniture, and decorative items [Ex. 571, p. 8]. <T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Non-ferrous foundries are establishments thatmelt and cast non-ferrous metals. Of interest in this rulemaking are thosefoundries casting metal alloys which contain lead, namely copper and copper-basedbrass and bronze castings. (Lead is added at concentrations that rangefrom 0.02 to 42.5 percent in 130 commercially available alloys, primarilyto increase the properties of tightness, lubricity, and machinability [Ex.475-3, p. 2; Ex. 582-84, p. 2].) In written testimony submitted by James L. Mallory, the Executive Directorof the Nonferrous Founders' Society, at the Informal Public Hearing heldNovember 3-6, 1987 in Washington, DC [Ex. 581-2, p. 2], reference was madeto the 1986 Foundry Industry Census [Ex. 658]. This census indicates that1,291 foundries are involved in the production of brass and bronze alloys.This figure includes all foundries for which brass and bronze alloy castingsare a primary activity (over 50% of production) as well as those for whichsuch castings are a secondary or tertiary activity (less than 50% and lessthan 10% of production, respectively). Also included are a substantialnumber of ``captive'' foundries (those establishments where castings areproduced and incorporated into another manufactured product or processat the same establishment) that may be found in SIC classifications otherthan 3362, such as 3432 (Plumbing Fixtures and Brass Goods), 3494 (Valveand Pipe Fittings), and 3561 (Pump and Pumping Equipment Manufacturers).For the purposes of this rulemaking, OSHA estimates the number of foundriesaffected by the standard to be 1,291 based on the latest estimates submittedby the ACMA and AFS. Of these 1,291 foundries, approximately one-half,or about 616 foundries, primarily produce brass, bronze, and copper alloycastings [Ex. 581-2, testimony of J. Mallory, p. 2]. The remaining 675foundries produce some brass, bronze, and copper castings, although theirprimary work is with other metals and alloys [Ex. 677]. Also, informationin the 1986 foundry census indicates that about 20 percent of all foundriesare exclusively captive or primarily captive [Ex. 658, p. 2]. Thus, OSHAestimates that about 258 captive operations are part of this industry sector.OSHA also estimated establishment count by size category. Three size categorieswere used: small plants employing 9 or fewer workers, small plants employing10 to 19 workers, and large plants employing 20 or more workers. The numberof establishments in each of these size categories is provided with respectto primary function in Table H. Based on the latest information, there are approximately 18,585 lead-exposedworkers in this sector. Total employment has been estimated to be about23,000 [Ex. 686a, p. 2]. Non-ferrous foundries are predominantly small establishments, with thegreat majority of firms operating only one foundry. In 1982, the CensusBureau reported 484 firms owning 500 foundries in SIC 3362 [Ex. 571, p.11]. Recent information indicates that 57 percent of all foundries involvedin the production of brass and bronze castings employ fewer than 20 workers[Ex. 582-84, p. 1]. Value of Shipments data was compiled by Meridian in current dollars andin constant 1982 dollars for primary brass and bronze foundries (SIC 3362)[Ex. 571, p. 9]. As would be expected due to the recession of the early1980s, both indicators showed a sharp drop of 15 to 20 percent between1981 and 1982. Bet7een 1982 and 1985, value of shipments in current dollarsincreased from $702 million to $797 million while the value of shipmentsin constant 1982 dollars was unchanged. Weight of metal content decreasedfrom 564 thousand short tons to 444 thousand between '81 and '82. Increaseswere realized in each of the next two years but a decrease from 504 thousandshort tons to 470 thousand occurred between '84 and '85 [Ex. 571, p. 9].More recently, shipments of copper castings were estimated to have increasedby about 11 percent between 1986 and 1987 and by about 10 percent between1987 and 1988 [U.S Industrial Outlook, 1989, Department of Commerce]. With regard to import competition, Meridian reported that<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * imports can compete with domestically produced castings in avariety of ways. Castings may be imported directly by firms using castings.Products incorporating castings, such as valves, fittings, and decorativeitems, may also be imported. In addition, increased imports of machineryreduce the domestic market for castings [Ex. 571, p. 10].</ITAG>No data were available which would allow OSHA to develop a quantitativeestimate of the degree of import penetration. Dun andamp; Bradstreet financial information for 1986 and 1988 provided estimatesof average sales and allowed OSHA to compute rates of return on sales (ROS)for Primary Brass, Bronze, and Copper Foundries (SIC 3362) by asset sizeclass. For those firms with less than $100,000 in total assets, the 1988median ROS was 2.4 percent; for firms having total assets of between $100,000and $1,000,000, the 1988 median ROS was 5.7 percent; and for firms in theover $1,000,000 asset class, the 1988 median ROS was 6.2 percent. (ROSrates for 1986 reported by Meridian research (Ex. 571, p. 14) were usedto disaggregate and apportion the total ROS for the industry sector whichwas available for 1988.) This information suggests that most primary brass,bronze, and copper foundries were operating profitably in 1988. These datawere used in conjunction with 1988 data from Dun's Market Identifiers,which provided sales by employment size class, to compute economic impacts.Rates of return on sales for manufacturers in SIC codes other than 3362were examined for the year 1985 and were not found to differ significantlyfrom SIC 3362 [Ex. 686a, p. 7]. These facilities were in SICs where captivefoundries most likely would be found. Information submitted into the record provided another source of financialdata. Meloon Foundries, a small facility, claimed sales of $3,000,000 and4 percent net profit on sales, though only 20 percent of their businessis lead related [Ex. 582-2]. Another small foundry, Kloppenborg Foundryand Fan Company, claimed $330,000 in total sales, a return on assets (ROA)of 5.74 percent, and a return on net worth of 6.05 percent [Ex. 582-29].Over the last 5 years, Kloppenborg's percentage of brass-related saleshas ranged from 19 percent to 24 percent. Montclair Bronze, a foundry employing25 workers, reported lead-related sales of $490,000 and a net worth of$800,000 for 1986. Lead-related returns make up 20 percent of Montclair'stotal returns [Ex. 582-37]. A large operation, Ford Meter Box Company,reported a dollar value of castings for 1986 of approximately $9 million[Ex. 582-81]. All returns for this company are lead related. Foundry ``D''[Ex. 667], also a large foundry with essentially all of its returns beinglead related, has sales which range between $8 and $15 million annually.<T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>This section presents OSHA's estimate ofthe compliance costs that would be incurred by employers in the nonferrousfoundry industry sector in order for them to achieve the permissible exposurelimit of 50 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air by engineering andwork practice controls. Only those costs associated with engineering andwork practice controls were considered, and no savings due to reductionsin costs for respirator usage were estimated. In developing its estimate,OSHA relied on the study performed by its contractor, Meridian Research,comments submitted in response to OSHA's August 3, 1987 request for information,comments and testimony received prior to, during, and after the informalpublic hearing held November 3-6, 1987, and information obtained from threesite visits to nonferrous foundries. Compliance costs expected to be incurred by foundries were estimated byMeridian Research in their August, 1987 report and were dependent uponthe number of sources of lead dust and fume in the facility as well asthe extent of ventilation controls, if any, already in place. The incrementalannualized costs were estimated separately for small and large facilities.Prior to and during the informal public hearing, a number of comments werereceived from the public regarding the Meridian cost estimates. Joint commentssubmitted by the American Cast Metals Association (ACMA) and the NonferrousFounders' Society (NFFS) expressed the view that Meridian understated themagnitude of the compliance costs [Ex. 582-86, p. 15]. One cause of this,they argued, was Meridian's apparent failure to include the substantialexpense of a traveling vent in their $15 per cfm (cubic feet per minute)ventilation expense. The commenters also cite a submittal by Philip S.Zettler, President of Vulcan Engineering Co., a manufacturer of ventilationequipment and traveling vents, in which Mr. Zettler stated that ``the costto control lead to [the] proposed standard in small foundries would beon the magnitude of $500,000 to $700,000'' [Ex. 582-34]. (The estimatemade by Mr. Zettler included no baseline information, that is, the levelof control that was assumed to be in place in a small foundry to beginwith, though it is generally agreed that this level is quite low. Also,no information was given as to the assumed lead content of the alloys).The ACMA-NFFS comments were also critical of Meridian's modelling of foundries.The commenters pointed out that the number of grinding and finishing stationsmodelled did not reasonably represent such facilities [Ex. 582-86, p. 16].These commenters also objected to the baseline level of control used byMeridian, claiming it was too high [Ex. 582-86, pp. 16-17]. Unfortunately,no specific correction was suggested. Chicago Faucet noted that the costs developed in the Meridian report wereunderstated, asserting that ``Meridian has totally ignored the cost orinstallation of make-up air'' [Ex. 582-13, p. 4]. At the industry-widelevel, a submission by Mr. James Mallory argued that Meridian's count ofthe number of foundries affected by the standard was underestimated [Ex.581-2, p. 2]. Other evidence in the record suggests that the Meridian cost estimatesmay have been overstated. Dr. Franklin Mirer, a toxicologist and CertifiedIndustrial Hygienist and director of the Health and Safety Department ofthe UAW, stated that the $15 per cfm estimate was unrealistic for smallerplants, and cited instead figures of $4 to $7 per cfm [Ex. 643; Tr., 829-830].During questioning at the hearing, Dr. Mirer explained that for certainsmaller facilities it might be possible to achieve the standard using onlygeneral ventilation techniques [Tr., p. 839], and that in such a case theventilation cost would only be about $4 per cfm. Even if a small facilitydoes need a ``conventional'' ventilation system, the costs are likely tobe less than for a large facility due to the fact that less ductwork isrequired. [Ex. 643, p. 8; Tr., 839-840]. Meridian's Addendum [Ex. 686a] to their August, 1987 report reflects thesecommenters' concerns with regard to costs. The model foundries were adjustedto more accurately represent existing conditions in foundries. Specifically,the number of grinding and finishing stations, as well as travelling ventsfor ladles, were increased [Ex. 686a, p. 43]. Also, a cut-off saw was addedas an emission source and ventilation requirements for furnace operationsand shakeout areas were increased. With regard to the number of affectedfoundries industrywide, the total was increased to 1,291 to include allcaptive and non-captive foundries. Also, Meridian's original estimate of the baseline level of control forsmall foundries was increased to reflect information which indicated thatthey have, on average, implemented about 30% of the controls necessary,as opposed to the 10% figure used previously [Ex. 686a, p. 44].Meridian responded to questions concerning the types of costs includedin their $15 per cfm estimate during the informal public hearing. Theyindicated that ``[t]his was an estimate designed to cover all of the aspectsof the ventilation cost, the direct ventilation, the baghouse, any thingsneeded for makeup'' [Tr., p. 442]. Existing evidence in the public recordappears to support this value as a reasonable estimate for average costsper cfm for large foundries. Foundry ``B'' [Exhibit 667] describes a 175,000cfm system which cost $988,755. This equates to only $5.65 per cfm (butdoes not include costs incurred by foundry personnel). In a submittal madeby the Ford Meter Box Company [Ex. 582-81], costs of $8.67 per cfm werereported in 1981 for a mold ventilation system (about $9 in 1985). Costshigher than $15 per cfm were reported by Wisconsin Centrifugal. Averagecosts for systems ``A'', ``C'', ``E'', and ``F'' were about $17 per cfmin 1980, and did not include makeup air [Ex. 582-59]. Small foundries apparently have an advantage in that they require shorterruns of ductwork, as noted above. To reflect this advantage, Meridian revisedtheir unit cost for ventilation to $7 per cfm for small foundries. Usingthis value produced an average incremental capital cost of compliance of$245,700 per small foundry [Ex. 686a, p. 44]. Total annual costs, includingannualized capital (annualized at a 10 percent cost of capital and usefullife of 12 years) and operation and maintenance expenses estimated at 10percent of capital costs each year, would be $60,640. These costs are summarizedin Table D. (Small foundries as defined by Meridian for the purposes oftheir analysis were those plants employing 20 or fewer workers). Theseare the average costs required per foundry to move from the baseline tocompliance with the 50 microgram PEL. Evidence submitted into the docketindicates that this is a reasonable estimate for many small foundries,particularly those for which lead-containing castings are a secondary orminor product. For example, Meloon Foundries, Inc., a small foundry whichsubmitted cost data, estimated that an investment of $250,000 would berequired to implement fume control for existing facilities. AACCO Foundry,Inc. also submitted cost estimates [Ex. 582-58]. They quoted $2,600 asthe engineering design fee for a ventilation system and $80,000 as thecost of the system itself. The size of this foundry was not discernablefrom the letter submitted, but it was assumed that it was a small foundry.As noted above, the estimate for small foundries developed by Meridianapplied to all foundries with fewer than 20 employees. However, informationobtained from Duns Market Identifiers, which allowed OSHA to better utilizefinancial statistics contained in the public record, as described below,indicated that approximately 67 percent of this group actually employ fewerthan 10 workers. Since information in the record indicates that exhaustair requirements could be less for very small foundries, OSHA believesthat the Meridian estimate overstates compliance costs for these firms[Exs. 689-4D; 571, p. 14]; thus, OSHA has estimated costs for very smalloperations separately. It is estimated that very small foundries pouringprimarily leaded alloys will require ventilation for three pit-type furnacesand two finishing stations while foundries of this size pouring primarilynon-leaded alloys will require ventilation for one such furnace and onefinishing station. Ventilation requirements would be 3,000 cfm per furnace[Ex. 689-4D, p. 7-3] and 2,000 cfm per finishing station [Ex. 686a, p.45]. Each very small foundry is also estimated to require ventilation forone hand-pouring station, at 2,000 cfm, and one shakeout station at 6,000cfm [Ex. 686a, p. 45]. Unit costs were estimated to be $4 per cfm. Totalannual costs for ventilation, including annualized capital and Oandamp;Mexpense, and assuming baseline compliance to be 30%, would be $14,512 forprimary brass and bronze foundries and $8,984 for foundries pouring primarilynon-leaded alloys. Costs for additional housekeeping for primary brass and bronze foundriesemploying 9 or fewer workers were estimated to be 50 percent of the Meridianestimate for small plants, or $829, while costs for additional housekeepingfor foundries pouring primarily non-leaded alloys and employing 9 or fewerworkers were estimated to be 25 percent of the Meridian estimate, or $415.Total annual costs for these foundries would be $15,341 (foundries primarilypouring leaded alloys) and $9,399 (foundries primarily pouring non-leadedalloys). Meridian's revised capital cost estimate for large foundries was $376,500[Ex. 686a, p. 46]. Total annual costs would be $92,920, including annualizedcapital costs and operation and maintenance expenses. These costs are summarizedin Table E. For those foundries in all size categories for which leaded alloys constituteless than 10 percent of all production, lead fume and dust may be generatedonly occasionally. OSHA estimates that little or no cost will be incurredby such firms, since their workers should come under the 30-day exclusionrule, with 8-hour TWA exposures not exceeding the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PELfor 30 days or more per year. (Under paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard,any employer who can demonstrate that workers are exposed to lead in excessof 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for 30 or fewer days per year is permitted to use anycombination of controls to achieve the PEL.) Second, information in therecord indicates that small foundries typically have some controls in place[Ex. 686a, p. 44], and these may be all that are required to limit exposurebelow the PEL [Tr., p. 839]. Lastly, many of these firms may be able tophase out most or all of the lead-related portion of their business. Comments received regarding Meridian's revised figures suggest, however,that for some foundries, potential cost impacts could be greater; variationsin production processes, production levels, and lead content of castingsmay cause certain facilities to incur additional costs. OSHA, therefore,adjusted the final Meridian estimates to develop high end cost estimates.These high end estimates assume that all foundries employing 10 or moreworkers and primarily producing high lead alloy castings would need toimplement each control method specified below to achieve the PEL of 50andCx.18;g/m\3\. For such foundries, OSHA doubled the number of travelling vents for ladlesand increased furnace ventilation to 30,000 cfm (to allow for the provisionof a roof-mounted, slotted, canopy-type hood). For large foundries (20or more employees), OSHA increased the number of pouring lines from 2 to3 [Ex. 694-27, p. 6] as well as doubled the pouring line ventilation. Airvolume requirements for shakeout for larger foundries were adjusted from6,000 cfm to 20,000 cfm [Ex. 689-4B] and the number of cut-off saws wasincreased from 1 to 2. Costs were added to the estimate for large foundriesfor the ventilation of two blasting machines [Ex. 694-27, p. 6]. Also,since foundries located in areas where winters are particularly harsh couldincur higher annual operating costs due to the heating of make-up air,the typical Oandamp;M expense of 10 percent of capital costs was increasedto 12.5 percent. The annual costs associated with these adjustments were$36,150 for smaller foundries (10-19 employees) and $91,949 for large foundries.Fresh air pulpits may be implemented in some foundries as needed to isolateemployees working on the charging deck. Capital costs are estimated tobe $15,000 with annual costs being $3,952, based on a useful life of 12years and HEPA filter replacements [Ex. 686c, p. 31]. It is anticipatedthat smaller foundries will acquire one pulpit and large foundries willacquire two. Costs for the enclosure of cabs of mobile equipment couldalso be required. Costs for these enclosures were estimated to be $5,000per unit [Ex. 686c, pp. 32-33]. Annualized capital costs would be $734per unit, and annual Oandamp;M expenses would be $3,600, including HEPA filterreplacement. Small foundries were estimated to require 2 cabs and largefoundries were estimated to require 4. OSHA estimated costs for isolation and barrier construction to preventcross contamination. Costs for partitioning in small and large foundriesare estimated to be $25,000 and $50,000, respectively. Annualized capitalcosts (based on a twenty year useful life) will be $2,938 for small foundriesand $5,875 for large. Labor costs incurred due to the need for additional housekeeping were addedas well. This cost is expected to be $3,357 for the smaller foundries and$6,713 for large foundries. Costs for annual cleaning were estimated tobe $50,000 for large foundries and $25,000 for small [Ex. 694-9]. Costs for the industrial hygiene survey are estimated to be about $500per day. The survey would require two days, one for planning and one foractual exposure monitoring and evaluation of mechanical systems. Thus,an initial cost of $1,000 would be incurred. (Larger foundries may requireadditional time, and thus, additional initial costs). Though reevaluationmay be necessary, no recurring costs are anticipated. OSHA's high end cost estimates are summarized in Tables F and G, and alsoassume a baseline level of control for most equipment of approximately30 percent for small foundries and approximately 80 percent for large foundries[Exs. 571; 686a]. (This is the percentage of controls prescribed whichare already estimated to be in place for these two types of foundries.)The baseline level for annual cleaning was estimated to be 25 percent [Exs.684e; 684f; 684g]. No comment was received into the public record whichsuggested that these levels misrepresent current industry practice. Adding the adjustments developed above to the previous estimates of $60,640for small foundries and $92,920 for large foundries yields upper boundestimates of annual costs of $129,258 for small facilities and $238,008for large.Thus, costs for small foundries employing 10 or more employees and primarilyproducing non-leaded alloys were estimated to be $60,640 and costs forsmall foundries primarily producing leaded alloys were estimated to be$129,258. Costs for large foundries primarily producing non-leaded alloyswere estimated to be $92,920 and costs for large foundries primarily producingleaded alloys were estimated to be $238,008.To estimate total industry costs, it is assumed that 57 percent of the1,291 affected foundries are small, employing fewer than 20 workers [Ex.582-84]. Therefore, 736 foundries are small and 555 are large. Further,it is estimated that about 60 percent of all primary brass and bronze foundriesare small [Exs. 658, p. 7; 571, p. 11]. Since 616 foundries are primarybrass and bronze foundries, 370 would be small and 246 would be large.Thus, there are 370 small foundries (67 percent, or 248, of which employfewer than 10 workers) whose primary product is brass and bronze, and 366small foundries (245 of which employ fewer than 10 workers) producing leadcontaining alloys as a secondary or tertiary activity (736-370). Also,there are 246 large foundries whose primary product is brass and bronzeand 309 large foundries producing lead containing alloys as a secondaryor tertiary activity (555-246). Using the cost figures shown in Table H,total annual costs for small foundries were estimated to range from approximately$11.2 million to $29.2 million and total annual costs for large foundrieswere estimated to range from approximately $22.9 million to $87.3 million.Industrywide, total annual costs will range from $34.1 million to $116.5million.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table D._Estimated Costs

for small and large nonferrousfoundries were determined with regard to the ranges of costs presentedin the previous section. Financial information was provided by MeridianResearch and by commenters to the public record. In addition, OSHA reliedupon publicly accessible data (Duns Market Identifiers).Table H summarizes the economic impacts for the nonferrous foundry industry.The first two columns of the table provide a summary of the number of establishmentsand exposed workers in each of the three size categories. The 18,585 exposedworkers were apportioned using data on employment found in the public record[Ex. 686a, p. 6].Column three provides estimates of lead related sales based on informationavailable from Dun and Bradstreet's Duns Market Identifiers (1988). Thesepublicly accessible data allowed the Agency to estimate average sales byemployment size class. (No comparable data were provided by industry sourcesin response to OSHA's request.) The data relate to SIC 3362, Primary Brass,Bronze, and Copper Foundries, and appear in Table H for foundries primarilyinvolved in the production of leaded alloys. Sales for foundries primarilyproducing non-leaded alloys were assumed to average 25 percent of primaryproducers' sales.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE </T4>H._Summary of Economic Impacts for the Non-Ferrous FoundryIndustry<H1>Size of plant (employment) </H1><H1>No. </H1><H1>Exposed workers </H1><H1>Sales/plant ($thous.) </H1><H1>Lead related profits/plant </H1>a ($thous.)<H1>Total profits/</H1>a ($thous.)<H1>Costs/plant ($thous.) </H1><H2>low</H2><H2>high </H2><H1>Ratio: costs/sales </H1><H2>low</H2><H2>high </H2><H1>Ratio: Costs/lead rel. profits </H1>b<H2>low </H2><H2>high</H2><H1>Ratio:   Costs/total   profits </H1>b <H2>low </H2><H2>high</H2>Small (0-9) <ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily lead<D>248</D><D>1240</D><D>248</D><D>5.95</D><D>7.94</D><D/><D>15.34</D><D/><D>0.06186</D><D/><D>2.19084</D><D/><D>1.64313</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily non-lead<D>245</D><D>557</D><D>62</D><D>1.49</D><D>7.94</D><D>0.00</D><D>9.40</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.15160</D><D>0.00000</D><D>5.36905</D><D>0.00000</D><D>1.00670</D></ITAG>Small (10-19) <ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily lead<D>122</D><D>1830</D><D>785</D><D>44.75</D><D>59.66</D><D>60.64</D><D>129.26</D><D>0.07725</D><D>0.16466</D><D>1.15195</D><D>2.45546</D><D>0.86396</D><D>1.84159</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily non-lead<D>121</D><D>726</D><D>196</D><D>11.19</D><D>59.66</D><D>0.00</D><D>60.64</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.30899</D><D>0.00000</D><D>4.60780</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.8396</D></ITAG>Large (20 or more) <ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily lead<D>246</D><D>9107</D><D>7100</D><D>440.20</D><D>586.93</D><D>92.92</D><D>238.01</D><D>0.01309</D><D>0.03352</D><D>0.13932</D><D>0.35885</D><D>0.10449</D><D>0.26764</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Primarily non-lead<D>309</D><D>5130</D><D>1775</D><D>110.05</D><D>586.93</D><D>0.00</D><D>92.92</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.05235</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.55727</D><D>0.00000</D><D>0.10449</D><F/>a Total profits after taxes were derived from sales using the followingschedule of return on sales (ROS) rates: small (0-9), 2.4%; small (10-19),5.7%; large (20 or more), 6.2%. <F/>b See text for derivation.

These figures were derived by applyingthe 1988 Dun and Bradstreet rate of return on sales (ROS) for SIC 3362to the sales figures in column 3 [Ex. 571, p. 14] (see footnote ``a,''Table H). The 1988 industry median ROS for SIC 3362 was disaggregated andapportioned based on 1986 establishment size ROS levels (see Ex. 571, p.14). This assumes that the relative profitability of the three size classesof foundries has remained constant from 1986 to 1988.Column 5 provides estimates of total profits. Since leaded alloys compriseonly a portion of the foundry product for a large number of facilities,another factor to be considered in assessing the ability of the firms inthis industry to absorb the costs of compliance was the extent to whichthey pour non-leaded alloys. Producers for whom the sale of leaded castingsrepresents a small fraction of total sales could avoid compliance costsaltogether by shifting away from the production of leaded castings. Ifthis is not an option, compliance costs could be financed by a combinationof pass-through and absorption from total profits. Additionally, at least20 percent of all affected foundries are part of larger corporations, whichmore easily could be able to absorb compliance costs.In column 6, cost ranges as developed for six different size and lead productioncombinations are provided.Column 7 contains estimated price increases, computed as the ratio of coststo lead related sales. Price impacts were computed assuming full cost pass-through.If total cost pass-through were possible for foundries in the smallestsize category, price increases will range from 0 to 15 percent; for foundrieswith 10 to 19 workers, increases of 0 to 31 percent are indicated; andfor large foundries, price increases of 0 to 5 percent would be required.However, due to foreign competition, full pass-through of costs is notan option for this industry, but with the falling exchange rate of thedollar, OSHA believes some pass through should be possible without losingmarket share. In addition, since industry reported that ``[a]pproximately10 percent of annual foundry industry output is used for national defensepurposes * * *'' [Ex. 582-86], OSHA believes some cost pass-through todefense contractors could also be possible.Columns 8 and 9 provide profit impacts, computed as the ratio of annualcosts to either lead-related or total profits. It should be noted thatthe tax deductibility of compliance costs was taken into account in computingprofit impacts. That is, care was taken to compute before-tax profit beforesubtracting annual costs. After subtracting annual costs, the appropriateaverage tax rate (either 15 or 34 percent) was then reapplied to determineafter-tax profit net of costs. (See footnote ``b,'' Table H.)The profit impacts in Table H were computed assuming compliance costs wouldbe fully absorbed by each foundry. Profit impacts for large firms primarilyproducing leaded alloys will range from 10 and one-half to 35 and one-halfpercent while impacts on large foundries primarily producing non-leadedalloys will range from 0 to 56 percent. Impacts on total profits for smallfoundries will range from 0 to over 180 percent, and could exceed leadrelated profits by over 5 times for some small firms. This is an extremeor ``worst case'' estimate, since it assumes no cost pass-through possibility.Also, the example captures the effect on the average plant; plants withabove average profits should remain viable. Nevertheless, the effect ofthe rule on small business in this industry sector is substantial.The annual costs of compliance for the primary brass and bronze foundryindustry (SIC 3362), which are estimated to be about $40-$50 million atthe time the standard goes into effect, are about two times annual newcapital expenditures as reported in the docket for the years 1981 to 1985[Ex. 571, p. 34]. Existing capitalization spending, however, is concentratedamong the larger more technologically advanced firms in the industry. Literallyhundreds of small plants have failed to reinvest in capital improvementsand as a result, continue to work obsolete machinery and processes. Thereinvestment and capitalization record of such foundries has not been adequateto maintain a competitive technology base. In sum, capitalization, at leastfor small firms, has been chronically underfunded.OSHA also examined economic trends in the foundry industry. It is expectedthat the foundry industry will continue to contract and evidence in thepublic record strongly suggests that this contraction is likely to occurprimarily among captive operations, most of which are assumed to be small,and to a lesser extent, within the smallest size class of foundries [Exs.658, p. 3].Casting users have turned increasingly to purchasing castings instead ofpouring their own at captive operations:<ITAG tagnum="21">Captive casting production will continue, but clearly at a reducedrate. Estimated at 45% of total casting production in 1984, it now probablyis in the 35 to 40% range and seems likely to decline further. [Ex. 658,p. 3].</ITAG>Thus, a substantial portion of the decline in establishment count willoccur as a result of the continuing shift away from captive production.This shift does not necessarily reflect or presage a decline in U.S. castingproduction activity:<ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. market for castings still is there, and in recent years castingusers have turned increasingly to purchasing castings, instead of makingtheir own. Strengthened by their successful survival tactics in recentyears, domestic suppliers can take advantage of that changing situation[Ex. 658, p. 3].</ITAG>This notion is supported by data reported by the Department of Commercein its 1989 Industry Outlook. Production of copper castings, after droppingoff about 20 percent between 1979 and 1981, gradually recovered duringthe 1980's and by 1988 was estimated to have reached the pre-recessionlevels of 1979 [U.S. Industrial Outlook, Department of Commerce, p. 18-13].In addition, recent technological advances in production for foundrieshave increased the minimum size of a facility that can realize full economiesof scale. Older technology is more labor intensive with significantly higherunit labor costs. The newer technology provides better quality castingsand lower unit costs, but requires more capital investment. (OSHA believesthat the new technology will also be more protective of workers' health.)In order to achieve the lower unit costs, production must occur on a largerscale. The globalization of markets in the 1980s has reinforced and acceleratedthis trend. The general shift to more capital intensive production inevitablyresults in the existence of larger and fewer foundries.As a result of the technological change, small operations have found themselvesat a competitive disadvantage. Larger foundries have been able to reduceproduction costs through automation and modernization. For small operations,such automation may not be practical, and further contraction in this segmentof the industry is expected to occur. Thus, it is apparent that small firmswill not be able to compete effectively with larger firms in the foundryindustry and the costs of complying with this remand would hasten theirexit.This contraction will be accelerated if the decline in the value of thedollar is reversed and imports of castings and finished goods incorporatingcastings rise. (For the three month period ending June, 1989, OSHA notesthat the dollar has strengthened against foreign currencies.) Additionally,the substitution of other materials for brass, bronze, and copper castings,such as aluminum or plastics, has contributed to industry contraction ingeneral, though brass, bronze, and copper castings will continue to finda variety of uses [Ex. 571, p. 10].The long-term decline in the nonferrous foundry industry is dramaticallyreflected in the establishment count. Over the last twenty-three years,the number of brass and bronze foundries in the U.S. and Canada has declinedfrom 2,281 to 1,392 [Ex. 658, p. 3]. Historically, brass and bronze foundrieshave exited the market at an average rate of between 2 and 2 and one-halfpercent annually [Ex. 658, p. 3]; during the decline the average numberof plants lost has been about 35 per year. When the period of economicadjustment and capitalization runs its course, firms remaining in thisindustry will be larger and more productive than their forebears, and willutilize more modern, capital intensive equipment with lower emissions ofhazardous materials, including lead.Against this background, economic feasibility was assessed as follows.Approximately 43 percent of the foundries affected by the standard arelarge, employing 20 or more workers. These foundries employ 77% of theexposed workforce and account for approximately 80 percent of industryshipments. Of the 555 large foundries, 309 pour primarily non-leaded alloys.Many of these plants, particularly those for which leaded alloys constitute10 percent or less of total production volume, could simply choose to focusproduction on non-leaded alloys and thereby avoid the costs of compliancealtogether. Many others qualify under the 30 day exclusion in paragraph(e)(1) of the lead standard and, therefore, bear no obligation to achievethe PEL by engineering and work practice controls, with the result thatno costs would be incurred. As noted above, some firms pouring only limitedamounts of leaded castings may already be in compliance and will also incurno cost. Those firms choosing to continue to produce leaded alloys willbenefit from increased market share and many should be able to financeannual costs from overall profits, since the cost to total profit ratiofor such firms, as shown in Table H, indicated an impact of about 10 andone-half percent. Impacts on lead related profits could be as high as 56percent for some plants in this category, though, as noted above, thisestimate assumes no pass-through and no increase in market share. Post-complianceROS on the lead-related portion of their business was calculated for theseplants and found to range between about 3 and 6.3 percent, after adjustingfor an increase in market share.\5\<NOTE/> Thus, OSHA concludes that large foundries pouring primarilynon-leaded castings should be able to absorb the costs of the rulemakingwithout experiencing undue burden.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ OSHA's post-regulation ROS is an approximation of theshort-run production increases of foundries responding to excess demandfor brass, bronze, and copper castings. The excess demand is generatedby an estimate that small foundries accounting for approximately 10 percentof total industry output will cease production if the 50 mg/m\3\ PEL goesinto effect. (Due to the interchangeability of capital resources, it ispossible that these firms will shift to the production of other types ofnonferrous alloys (zinc, aluminum, etc.).) OSHA assumes that of the totalnumber of small foundries estimated to cease production, the majority (80percent) are foundries pouring primarily leaded castings. Using <T3>Census of Manufactures </T3>data, OSHA calculated that small firmswith 0-9 employees account for 7 percent of production, small firms with10-19 employees account for 13 percent of production, and large firms accountfor 80 percent of production. <T3>U.S. Industrial Outlook</T3> reports that 290,000 short tons of copper-basedcastings were estimated to have been produced in 1988. OSHA distributed10 percent of 290,000 short tons across all firms expected to be in businessat the time full compliance with the OSHA lead rule becomes effective.Establishment size was used as a proxy for productive capacity and it wasassumed that the average firm earns a 10andCx.11; post-tax profit per eachpound of copper-based casting sold. The redistribution of excess demandis a result of the regional nature of U.S. markets for foundry productsand the ability of the larger foundries in each market area to be priceleaders (locally), due to their technological advantages. (See Ex. 658for a delineation of the 96 market areas). As small firms exit the market,large firms will tend to capitalize to meet excess demand, thereby improvingprofitability by realizing greater economies of scale. Since larger firmsare generally able to operate profitably, OSHA assumes that the necessarycapital will be available. OSHA notes, however, that the effect of thiscapitalization on short-run post-regulatory profitabilty is not reflectedin the post-regulatory rate of ROS computed in this analysis; due to datalimitations, this effect has not been quantified. Clearly, the decisionto expand production would only be made on the expectation of a profitablereturn on the investment.Two hundred and forty six large foundries primarily pour leaded alloys.Based on the figures shown in Table H, effects on total profits for thissegment of the industry should be no more than 27 percent and impacts onlead-related profits should be no more than 36 percent. For these plants,post-compliance ROS rates on the lead-related portion of their businesswere computed and found to range between 4.1 and 5.5 percent. Given theprofitability of these foundries, they should be able to finance the costsof the rulemaking without undue burden. There are estimated to be 736 small foundries (foundries employing 0-19workers), constituting 57 percent of the establishments affected by thisrulemaking. These plants employ about 23 percent of the exposed workforceand account for about 20 percent of industry shipments. An estimated 366 of these small foundries pour primarily non-leaded alloys(i.e., secondary and tertiary foundries). Given the continuation of existingmarket forces, many of these secondary and tertiary operations will ceaseoperations in coming years. In particular, OSHA expects many captive operationsto cease production.Many of the 366 plants could shift away from the production of leaded alloysor limit production in order to come under the 30-day exclusion rule. Sincethe capital resources used in the production of copper-based castings mayalso be used in the production of other nonferrous alloys, and since thefoundries in this category are already involved in the production of non-leadedcastings, this shift away from leaded alloys would not necessarily be accompaniedby a decline in industry employment and would not necessarily lead to establishmentclosures. In addition, many foundries already come under the 30-day exclusionrule (those foundries for which leaded alloys constitute less than 10 percentof total sales). Other foundries which remain in operation will benefitfrom increased market share. After adjusting for increased sales volume,post-compliance ROS for the lead-related portion of their business wasfound to vary widely for these firms, from ^19.6 percent to 6.7 percent.Clearly, if forced to face the costs of complying with this remand, someof these firms could choose to cease or limit production of leaded castings;others, however, should be able to finance the costs of the regulationand at the same time remain moderately profitable. OSHA estimates thata number of additional secondary and tertiary foundries will be able tofinance the costs of the rule from overall profits. For those foundrieswhich are captive operations, compliance costs could be more easily absorbedby the parent organization. Also, some foundries could provide castingscritical to the national defense, and could either pass costs forward orapply for a variance. Overall, OSHA estimates that under optimistic assumptions,one-half to two-thirds of the small secondary and tertiary foundries willbe able to avoid, absorb, or pass through compliance costs. Finally, there are 370 small plants primarily producing leaded alloys.OSHA estimates that as many as one-half to two-thirds of these operationscould cease production. Post-compliance ROS calculations based on lead-relatedprofits and adjusted for market redistribution indicate rates which rangebetween ^7.3 and 0.1 percent, though these rates do not take into accountcost pass-through. Some firms, however, could shift production toward non-leadedcastings and thus avoid a portion of the costs of compliance. The ownersof captive operations could choose to absorb costs from overall profits.In addition, some might be able to secure local support in the form offinancial incentives to relocate [Ex. 684f, p. 12] and, as noted above,some could provide castings critical to the national defense. OSHA concludes that approximately 310 to 430 of the 736 small plants currentlyproducing leaded alloys as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary functionwill continue production; thus, it is estimated that 42 to 57 percent ofall small foundries will cease operations. To sum up, two-thirds to three-quarters of all firms currently involvedin the production of brass, bronze, and copper castings will be able tofully comply with this regulation without experiencing undue financialharm. Moreover, 80-83 percent of the currently exposed workforce will remainemployed and benefit from the increased protection afforded under the rule.However, OSHA recognizes that many small foundries (foundries employing19 or fewer workers) will not be able to afford all necessary controls.The cost of automation has ensured that many small firms will not be ableto compete with large firms and that profit levels for many small firmswill not be sufficient to bear the costs of this rule. OSHA has noted thatsome of these small firms will exit the industry without regard to thisrulemaking. However, the exit of a substantial number of these foundriescould be hastened by the OSHA rule. Therefore, based on the legal criteriaon economic feasibility established by the court in the lead decision,<T3>USWA </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>647 F.2d at 1265, it is OSHA's judgment that if therule significantly contributes to the withdrawal of over one-half of smallfoundries, which constitute about 60 percent of the nonferrous foundries,the Agency concludes for the nonferrous foundry industry that achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controls iseconomically infeasible. OSHA has not, however, examined the economic feasibilityof achieving a PEL between 50-200 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineeringand work practice controls.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Secondary Copper Smelting </ITAG><T3>Process Description.</T3> Secondary copper smelting is the recoveryof copper from scrap copper by scrap metal preparation, smelting, refining,and casting. The process fundamentally involves increasing refinement ofthe copper product by eliminating lead and other impurities. The exclusivesource of lead in the industry is the scrap, which can contain up to 10%lead (Ex. 686C, p. 11). The blast furnace operation where the scrap isinitially melted, is the major contributor of lead to the air. Smelting and refining are carried out in various types of furnaces suchas blast furnaces, holding furnaces, converters, Maerz (reverberatory)furnaces, and shaft furnaces, depending upon the purity of the scrap metal.The final step is casting of the refined copper metal, which contains only.08-.2% lead (Ex. 684d, p. 3), into a desired form. <T3>Scrap Metal Preparation.</T3> Secondary copper smelters use any metallicscrap that contains useful amounts of copper, including punchings, turnings,defective or surplus goods, metallurgical residues, and worn-out or damagedarticles (e.g., automobile radiators, pipe, or wire). The scrap is firstcleaned and concentrated to prepare it for smelting. Feed scrap is concentratedby manual and mechanical methods such as sorting, stripping, shredding,and magnetic separation of ferrous metals. Scrap is sometimes briquettedin a hydraulic press or given pyrometallurgical pretreatment (e.g., sweating,burning off insulation, and drying in rotary kilns). The concentrated scrapis then transferred to the blast furnace by a front-end skip loader (Ex.573, pp. 2-3). <T3>Blast Furnace Operation.</T3> Smelting involves one or more processes,depending on the quality of the feed material. Low-grade scrap must becharged into a coke-fired blast furnace to be melted along with fluxesand coke. Impurities in the scrap are removed by the coke fuel and thegases formed during combustion. The blast furnace operates on a 24-hour-per-daybasis and is shut down only for maintenance or plant-wide scheduled downtime(Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 8-10). The charge is delivered by a front-end skip loader, which carries the chargebetween the scrapyard and the charge door. The guillotine-type chargingdoor, operated by an overhead hoist, is approximately 9 by 9 feet and islocated about 6 feet above the furnace's tapping hole. The driver loadsthe bucket with low-grade scrap and positions the vehicle in front of thecharge door. A control box for the charge door is within reach. After openingthe charge door, the operator moves the vehicle forward, inserting thefront-end loader's bucket into the furnace shaft and unloading the concentratedscrap. After unloading, the operator backs out and closes the door. Duringcharging, the door of the blast furnace remains open for one to five minutes(Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 8-10). The product of the blast furnace, called black copper, contains 2-10% leadby weight and still includes slag (Ex. 684d, p. 2). The black copper istapped on a continuous basis from the bottom of the furnace shaft throughan open launder to the holding furnace, into which it is fed. From timeto time, the tapping process is halted to allow maintenance of the laundertap hole (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 8-10). <T3>Holding Furnace.</T3> The main function of the cylindrical holdingfurnace is to remove impurities from the black copper. The holding furnaceacts both as a storage reservoir and a vessel to separate the slag generatedin the blast furnace. While no smelting occurs in this operation, enoughheat is added to this oil-fired furnace to keep the contents molten (Ex.475-32D, H-004E, p. 10). Since copper is heavier than slag, copper occupies the bottom of the vesseland slag floats on top. The furnace can be rotated along its centerlinein both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. By rotating the furnacethe slag is poured off into an open launder, where it is granulated bya water jet. This is done on a nearly continuous basis. The granulatedslag is removed by front-end loader to storage areas until shipment tocustomers (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 10). When enough black copper has been captured in the holding furnace, thefurnace is tapped. A ladle is moved into position by an overhead, remote-controlledcrane. The holding furnace is then rotated clockwise and the black copperis poured into the ladle. An operator's station is located so the employeecan visually check the level of copper in the ladle and halt the tappingoperation when the ladle is full. The molten black copper in the ladleis usually charged into a converter. At times when the converter is notin operation due to maintenance, the black copper can be charged in varyingquantities to a Maerz (reverberatory) furnace (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp.10-11). <T3>Converter.</T3> The function of the converter is to further refinethe copper from the holding furnace. Molten black copper is charged intothe converter, and silica fluxes are added to aid in the formation of slag.The process involves blowing air through the converter to drive off impuritieseither in the form of slag or fume. Most of the reactions involved withconverter operations are exothermic. Therefore, little heat needs to beadded to the vessel during the refining process (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p.11). The slag material is drawn off by rotating the cylindrical converter aboutits axis. Most of the slag is in the form of silicates and oxides. Theslag contains about 17% copper by weight. The slag is later reused as acomponent in the blast furnace charge (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 11). The product of the converter, called blister copper, is tapped and chargedto either a Maerz or shaft furnace. Blister copper contains only approximately1% lead (Ex. 684d, p. 3).<T3>Maerz (Reverberatory) Furnace. </T3>The Maerz (reverberatory) furnaceis a further stage in the refining process that produces anode-grade copperof over 99% purity. The Maerz furnace is charged with blister copper andclean, high-grade copper scrap. Dual fuel (oil and natural gas) burnerssupply the necessary heat to melt the charge and maintain the requiredtemperature. Oxidation and reduction reactions occur during the approximately24-hour cycle (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 12).Three 5-by-5-foot charging doors are used for charging the furnace. Electrically-poweredvehicles and fork-lift trucks transport the ladle for charging into thefurnace. The furnace tilts along its central axis for slagging and pouringoperations (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 12-13).During this refining process, cycle times and control procedures are basedon sampling and operator experience. The slag that forms rises to the surfaceof the melt and is poured off into pots which are handled by fork-lifttrucks. This slag is allowed to cool and then is reused as part of theblast furnace charge material. When refining is complete, the furnace istilted to pour the nearly pure copper into a launder system which leadsto the casting wheel (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 13).<T3>Shaft Furnace. </T3>The shaft furnace is used to melt copper that canbe directly cast into anodes without further refining. Thus, it is chargedonly with high quality copper scrap and returned anodes (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E,p. 14).Charging is accomplished by a conveyor/elevator that places materials intothe top of the shaft furnace. When the furnace is tapped, the copper isfed into a launder system which leads to the casting wheel (Ex. 475-32D,H-004E, pp. 14-15).<T3>Casting Wheel. </T3>A launder delivers the molten copper, which containsonly .08-.2% lead (Ex. 684d, p. 3), from the Maerz and shaft furnaces tothe ladle spoon at the casting wheel. There the final metal product iscast into anodes for electrolytic refining (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 14-15).The typical casting wheel is quite large (e.g., 43 feet in diameter), andturns and casts continuously. The castings enter a quench booth where awater spray cools and solidifies the copper. When the molds exit the quenchbooth, an ejection pin in the bottom of the mold forces the solidifiedcasting to rise slightly out of the mold. A pick-up conveyor lifts theanode casting from the mold and carries it to a bosh tank, where the anodeis further cooled. When five or six anodes accumulate in the tank theyare removed by fork-lift truck and weighed. Then they are stacked outsidethe building until they are taken to the electrolytic refining building(tankhouse) (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 14).<T3>Existing Exposure Levels.</T3> There are five air lead monitoring datasets in the record. The best by far is the data set from Company D (Ex.684d), which is a conventional secondary copper smelter with differentkinds of furnaces that use copper scrap of various grades. The data fromCompany D are recent, quite complete and contain some marginal notationswhich explain prevailing conditions at certain times when samples wereobtained. Moreover, because OSHA recently made a site visit to CompanyD, the Agency has concrete information on production processes, work practicesand engineering controls that allows it to better understand and interpretthe data provided. The other four data sets are from Smelter A (Ex. 668B), a company whichOSHA will refer to as Company X (Ex. 613b-2), OSHA inspection data (Ex.583-3), and a 1982 JACA report (Ex. 553-5). All have serious flaws thatmake them considerably less reliable and useful than Company D data. The data from Smelter A were submitted by the Institute of Scrap RecyclingIndustries at the close of the post-comment briefing period and cover theyears 1984-87. OSHA found Smelter A's data basically unuseable for thefollowing reasons. First, the data apparently cover less than \1/4\th ofthe company's lead-exposed workforce. Second, there are large gaps in thedata. For example, most of 1984 and part of 1985 are missing. Third, no information was provided on associated work practices and engineeringcontrols. Fourth, in a cursory manner Smelter A indicated that it had installedadditional engineering controls during the period of time covered by thedata, but it does not indicate specifically during what years and in whichoperations the engineering controls were implemented. In fact, SmelterA simply states that it added ``additional capacity for baghouses, exhaustfan motors and hooding.'' Therefore, despite Smelter A's assertion thatit spent more than $2 million between 1980-87 for these unspecified improvementsin engineering controls, it is impossible for the Agency to use the exposuredata to assess feasibility. Moreover, Smelter A's exposure levels inexplicablyappear to have increased rather than decreased over the years. This raisesquestions concerning the effectiveness and extent of the engineering controlsinstalled during this period. Finally, at least some of the data providedappear to suggest that certain operations are effectively uncontrolled,making that data useless in a feasibility assessment. For example, accordingto Smelter A's own table summarizing its most recent air monitoring samplingresults, the average air lead levels between January-September 1987 atthe reverberatory furnace, which processes copper with no more than 1%lead content, are nearly twice as high as the average exposure levels inthe blast furnace area, where lead-contaminated scrap is processed (Ex.668B). Similarly, the data from Company X (Ex. 613b-2) are not useable for thefollowing reasons. First, although the data were provided in response toa request for monitoring results from 1984-87, the company supplied datafor only one year. Second, not only did the company fail to describe theengineering and work practice controls associated with particular operationsand exposure levels, it also failed to adequately identify various employees.For example, in its monitoring data the company refers to the job categoryof ``furnace operator'' but provides no indication at which furnaces thoseoperators work. Thus, OSHA is unable to ascertain which specific exposuresare associated with the blast, holding, converter, Maerz or shaft furnaces,which is a critical distinction given the extreme variation in the leadcontent of the metal in the different furnaces. The third data set, composed of 29 samples from OSHA inspections of threesecondary copper smelters from 1984-87 (Ex. 583-3), is limited and fragmentary.Moreover, the kind of contextual information so useful for understandingand interpreting the data is largely lacking. For example, these data donot provide sufficient detail about job titles to allow operation-by-operationanalysis of exposures and do not contain information about associated engineeringand work practice controls. These data are therefore best utilized to confirmor deny analyses drawn from other data sets. The final data set is the report prepared in 1982 by JACA (Ex. 553-5).This report deals almost exclusively with the issue of economic feasibilityand devotes only two pages to an analysis of technological feasibility.In its report JACA provides no more than a paragraph or two describingexisting controls. Moreover, few or no raw exposure data are provided,and the few summary numbers that are provided are gathered from 1979-81.Since both Company D and Smelter A, for example, claim to have spent largesums of money to control air lead levels in the years since JACA collectedits data, more recent data are needed to reliably assess current technologicalfeasibility. Consequently, the Agency relies primarily on data from Company D to characterizebaseline lead exposures in this industry. OSHA feels that this is a reasonableand even conservative basis for making feasibility determinations for threereasons. First, the monitoring data from Company D indicate that operations withhigher exposure levels have been monitored more frequently than those withlower levels (Ex. 684d). Although this monitoring schedule is in accordancewith the requirements of the lead standard and good industrial hygienepractice, it inevitably skews reported average plant-wide exposure levelsand frequency distributions toward the high side (Ex. 686C, p. 7). Forexample, as Meridian has pointed out, in the blast furnace area, whereexposures are highest, 150 samples were taken for 14 job categories. Inthe casting area, where exposures are much lower, only 69 samples weretaken for nearly the same number (13) of job categories (Ex. 686C, p. 7).In addition, based upon its site visit to Company D and Company D's owndata concerning exposure levels in casting and the shaft and Maerz furnaceareas, OSHA believes that cross contamination has substantially contributedto raising employee exposure levels in these operations. In the clearestexample, the proportion of lead in the product in the casting operationis probably less than one-quarter of 1% (Ex. 684d, p. 3). Yet, even there,where exposures attributable to the operation itself should be low \6\<NOTE/>, fully 38% of the samples were above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, 6%were over 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the average was approximately 63 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ On this point, OSHA disagrees with Meridian, which didnot take account of the effects of cross contamination and therefore attributedthe exposure levels in casting to emission sources within that operation(Ex. 686C, p. 15). The Cadre Corporation, an industrial engineering consultant firm, seemsto agree with OSHA's position. When Cadre evaluated exposures at a secondarycopper facility in 1981, it also noted that cross contamination was chieflyresponsible for the lead exposures of employees working in the castingarea (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 22). Similarly, in the Maerz and shaft furnace operations, where the chargeof blister copper contains only 1% lead (Ex. 684d, p. 3) and where airlead levels therefore should be controllable to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,exposure levels at Company D are above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 82% and 78%of the samples, respectively, and the averages are 97 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and148.2 andCx.18;g/m\3\, respectively. Because of the low lead content of the materials being processed at thesestages, OSHA does not believe that the air lead levels associated withthese operations should be high. Nevertheless, at Company D the percentageof sampling results below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the shaft and Maerz furnacesis not statistically distinguishable from the percentage of samples below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in  the blast furnace area, where the lead content ofthe materials is much higher. OSHA believes that these results can be explainedonly by cross contamination throughout the plant. OSHA also notes that the exposure levels reflected in the OSHA inspectiondata for secondary copper smelters (Ex. 583-3) are considerably lower thanthose in the data from Company D, especially in the furnace area. Thissuggests that in relying upon the Company D data to characterize industryexposure levels, OSHA is being conservative. Notwithstanding the upward bias of the data from Company D, monitoringresults from this facility are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of thetime in the casting area (62%) and in the ``miscellaneous'' category (80%).Moreover, 84% of the samples in the casting operation and 93% of the samplesin the miscellaneous classifications are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, (Ex.684d, Table 5; see Table 1 below). Miscellaneous operations include laboratory technicians, the laundry, andthe scrapyard. The scrapyard, which has the highest exposures of thesethree operations, incorporates the receiving area, the brick plant andforklift operators. In the scrapyard employee exposure levels already arequite low. The overall average for scrapyard employees is approximately35 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Average exposure levels in 2 of the 3 scrapyard operationsare below 27 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and the third is below 53 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Inaddition, 77% of the sampling results of scrapyard employees are below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and the remainder are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 684d,Table 5).Again, even with considerable cross contamination in the plant, 59% ofthe sampling results of employees associated with the Maerz furnace and56% of the sampling results of those working near the shaft furnace alreadyare below 100 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 684d, Table 5).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,i1,s75,7,8,8,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Frequency Distribution of Company D Exposure Data, </T4>1984-1987 \1\<H1>Area</H1><H1>Number of samples</H1><H1>Distribution of samples at various concentrations (</H1>mg/m\3\) (percent)<H2>andless;50</H2><H2>andless;100</H2><H2>andless;200</H2><H2>andless;200</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Blast furnace<D>150</D><D>32(21)</D><D>61(40)</D><D>103(68)</D><D>47(31)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Casting area<D>69</D><D>43(62)</D><D>58(84)</D><D>65(94)</D><D>4(6)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shaft furnace<D>9</D><D>2(22)</D><D>5(56)</D><D>7(78)</D><D>2(22)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maerz furnace<D>27</D><D>5(18)</D><D>16(59)</D><D>25(93)</D><D>2(7)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Miscellaneous<D>30</D><D>24(80)</D><D>28(93)</D><D>30(100)</D><D>0</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>285</D><D>106(37)</D><D>168(59)</D><D>230(81)</D><D>55(19)</D><F>\1\ Source: Ex. 684d, Table 5.</F></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In the three operations in which average exposure levels are above50 mg/m\3\, the blast, Maerz and shaft furnaces, an additional factor upwardlybiases the data. That factor is the existence of a limited number of extremelyhigh data points that are not representative of routine exposure levels.For example, employee exposure levels in the dirtiest operation in theplant, the copper hole at the blast furnace, range from 100 mg/m\3\ to2,400 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 684d, Table 5). Of the 18 sampling results for thatoperation, fully two-thirds are below 337.1 mg/m\3\. Only 2 samples areover 1,850 and 3 others range from 635-817 mg/m\3\. Nonetheless, the arithmeticaverage is approximately 500 mg/m\3\. OSHA believes that this average figuredistorts the actual array of sampling results by effectively giving toomuch weight to aberrantly high sampling results. It further believes thatthe geometric mean more accurately portrays the array. In this case, thegeometric mean is 312.1 mg/m\3\. approximately two-thirds of the arithmeticmean (citations omitted to protect confidentiality).OSHA recognizes that there is no single number or even range of numbersthat can perfectly characterize a data set. A mere range of exposure levels(e.g., 100-2,400 mg/m\3\ for the copper hole operator) provides very littleuseful information about typical exposure levels. Similarly, the arithmeticmean, which is equivalent to the commonly used ``average.'' provides littleinsight into the distribution of exposures and is subject to gross distortionby extreme high or low numbers.OSHA believes that where a data set is lognormally distributed, as in thecase of Company D (Ex 686C, p 2), the geometric mean is the best singlestatistic to characterize the data set. (See the NIOSH publication, Leidel<T3>et al, Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual </T3>(1977).)OSHA is further assured of the reasonableness of relying upon the geometricmean by the fact that it appears to fit well with the court's definitionof feasibility. The court does not require that all operations be ableto achieve a particular PEL all of the time for the PEL to be feasible.Consequently, the mere existence of aberrant exposure levels does not constituteproof of infeasibility. In using the geometric mean to characterize exposuredata, the extreme outliers that are discounted are especially likely tobe very high, rather than low sampling results. Thus, because the geometricmean better characterizes actual exposures, OSHA relies primarily uponthe geometric mean in its feasibility analysis. This issue is discussedmore fully in the introductory section on technological feasibility.Utilizing this approach, it becomes clear that, even based on existingmonitoring results, only the blast furnace operation presents serious problemsfor controlling employee air lead levels to 50 mg/m\3\. The geometric meansin all other operations are below 90 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, Ex. 2). In thecasting and miscellaneous categories, for example, the geometric meansare below 50 mg/m\3\, at 41.2 mg/m\3\, and 27.9 mg/m\3\, respectively.In the Maerz furnace, the geometric mean is only somewhat above 50 mg/m\3\,at 78 mg/m\3\. In the shaft furnace, the geometric mean is below 100 mg/m\3\,at 88.6 mg/m\3\. (Ex. 686C, Ex. 2).In the blast furnace, where exposures are most difficult to control, thegeometric mean is only somewhat above 100 mg/m\3\ at 114.2 mg/m\3\. Inaddition, of the 14 job categories included in the blast furnace classification(which includes exposure data from the holding and converter furnace areas),no less than eight have geometric means below 100 mg/m\3\, and three ofthese are below 50 mg/m\3\. Of the remaining 6, only one is above 200 mg/m\3\,while three are below 120 mg/m\3\. Moreover, according to Company D's ownsubmission, one of the operations with the highest exposure levels, slagoperator, is virtually uncontrolled (Exs. 684d, p. 2; 686C, Ex. 2).<T3>Current Control Technologies. </T3>As OSHA has shown in the previoussection, even the upwardly biased sampling results from Company D indicatethat in at least 80% of the operations either a majority of sampling resultsare below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or the geometric means are below or not farabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In the blast furnace area, more than 20% of theoperations already have geometric means below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and morethan 57% have geometric means below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 684d, Table5). To characterize existing controls in the industry, OSHA continues to relyupon information from Company D (Exs. 684d; 686C; 688a). Although industryclaims that the controls in Company D are state-of-the-art and hardly typicalof the rest of the industry, OSHA's site visit to Company D confirms thatits controls are fundamentally conventional and readily available. Moreover,although on several occasions OSHA requested industry to provide informationconcerning associated engineering and work practice controls throughoutthe industry, industry generally failed to provide such information (Tr.725-26). Consequently, since industry's claim that Company D has implementedmore controls than the rest of the industry is essentially unsubstantiated,OSHA finds it reasonable to use Company D for these purposes. The existing level of control at Company D has been achieved primarilythrough general and local exhaust ventilation and despite serious crosscontamination of certain operations by the blast furnace. Existing engineeringcontrols and work practices at Company D have not been established on thebasis of industrial hygiene source identification and task analysis; thatis, the company has focused on obvious emission sources rather than employeeexposures (Ex. 684d, p. 17). As a consequence, management at Company Ddoes not appear to have a firm grasp on what factors are contributing toemployee exposures in each operation and which work practices and engineeringcontrols would be appropriate to control these factors. In addition, CompanyD does not perform periodic (e.g., annual) wall-to-wall housecleanings(Ex. 684d, p. 17). Current exposure levels at Company D have been achieved by means of thefollowing controls. <T3>General Building. </T3>Company D plant is a large open building withnatural ventilation. Some ceiling fans also have been installed. Althoughnatural ventilation and ceiling fans provide for a certain amount of dilutionand air circulation, the cross drafts created by the fans and the largeopenings in the building can cause cross contamination (Ex. 684d, p. 15).<T3>Scrap and Charge Preparation. </T3>The scrapyard is paved. It is washeddown and cleaned by street sweepers. Scrap is also wetted to reduce theamount of lead dust emitted from handling. The briquetting plant is a shedhousing the baling and briquetting machines, which compress fine materialsinto bricks that can be used for charging the furnaces. While the briquettingplant itself is locally exhausted, the cabs on the forklift trucks andfront-end loaders operating in this area are not enclosed (Ex. 684d, pp1, 2, 15, 17). <T3>Blast furnace. </T3>The blast furnace is equipped with enclosures andexhaust ventilation at the charging point and the tap point of the furnace.Both the charging and tap hoods are ventilated to baghouses before beingexhausted to the outside air (Ex. 684d, pp. 15, 16). The exhaust ventilation hood, positioned directly over and around the chargingpoint of the blast furnace, is activated when the furnace door opens. Ithas a design face velocity of 1,700 feet per minute. However, the effectivenessof this control is limited by ``upsets,'' which occur when scrap is loadedimproperly or an improperly selected load is charged. These upsets, whichoverwhelm or take place beyond the effective range of existing exhaustventilation, can occur as often as twice a week, company personnel report(Ex. 684d, pp. 15, 16, 17). <T3>Holding furnace. </T3>The holding furnace is equipped with exhaustducting at the point of discharge of the molten copper. There is no ventilationat the slag hole. In addition, the launder carrying the slag dischargedfrom the furnace is not enclosed and the slag granulating and samplingprocesses are not controlled (Ex. 684d, p. 16). <T3>Converter. </T3>The charging and discharging points of the converterare equipped with exhaust hoods. The hoods are only turned on when thefurnace is being charged with the ladle and when metal and slag are beingdischarged. These hoods are exhausted to baghouses (Ex. 684d, p. 16). <T3>Maerz and shaft furnaces. </T3>Both the Maerz (reverberatory) and shaftfurnaces are equipped with hooding and exhaust ventilation at the chargingpoint. The hooding is exhausted to baghouses before emissions are releasedinto the outside air (Ex. 684d, p. 16). <T3>Casting operation. </T3>The molten copper is transferred to the castingoperation via a launder that is semi-enclosed to retain heat. The steamgenerated during the quench is exhausted to a point outside the building(Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 14). <T3>Control rooms. </T3>There are several enclosed control rooms that areair conditioned. The blast furnace control room is a positive pressureenvironment using outside air. These control rooms are accessible to employees(Ex. 684d, p. 15). <T3>Work practices. </T3>Company D reports that the scrapyard is wettedfor dust control purposes, the scrap is heated before charging to driveoff any moisture, and the facility is regularly vacuumed. Company D furtherstates that it provides training, which includes instruction to employeesnot to stand in the area near furnace doors unless necessary (Ex. 684d,p. 17).<T3>Additional Controls and Expected Reduction of Exposure Levels.</T3>As discussed in the section above concerning existing exposure levels,most of the sampling results for employees working in the casting and miscellaneousoperations already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, p. 4). In addition,most employees in the shaft and Maerz furnace areas have geometric meanexposure levels below 90 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA believes that for operations where most sampling results or geometricmeans already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, relatively modest improvementsin work practices or engineering controls, such as improved housekeeping,will be sufficient to reduce employee air lead levels consistently below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For operations where most of the sampling results orgeometric means are below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA believes that a combinationof limited additional and improved existing controls (e.g., enclosing alaunder) will be sufficient to control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Specifically, OSHA believes, for example, that controlling employee exposurelevels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in the shaft and Maerz furnace areas shouldbe quite manageable, since a primary source of exposure is extraneous tothese operations (i.e., cross contamination from the blast furnace and,perhaps, other areas of the building) (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 42). The blast furnace area is the only one in secondary copper smelting wherecontrolling exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is likely to pose a seriousproblem. At Company D, it is clear that existing engineering and work practicecontrols do not effectively control exposure levels in this area (Ex. 686C,Ex. 2). Exposure data indicate that in some blast furnace operations currentengineering and work practice controls are inadequate, while in otherssuch controls appear to be nonexistent. OSHA believes that employee airlead levels can be reduced to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in many operationsin the blast furnace, as well as in any other operations requiring additionalcontrols, by implementing conventional and readily available industrialhygiene control techniques. The Agency's discussion of reductions of air lead levels expected to beachieved by implementing recommended controls relies in part on assessmentsmade by a panel of three certified industrial hygienists for OSHA's contractor,Meridian. These assessments are based upon data in the record, a site visitto Company D, and the extensive experience and expertise of the panel.Although quantification of the estimated reductions involves a substantialamount of expert judgment, OSHA believes that the panel's assessment isthe best available evidence in the record on the reduction in exposurelevels that can be reasonably expected from implementing recommended additionaland improved controls. OSHA, based on its own experience and expertise, therefore believes thatreliance upon Meridian is entirely reasonable. OSHA in its own analysisplaces much greater emphasis than did Meridian on the central problemsof controlling the blast furnace, cross drafts, and cross contaminationto reduce air lead levels in secondary copper smelting to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.From its analysis OSHA concludes that employee exposure levels in the blastfurnace can be reasonably managed and that cross contamination from theblast furnace can be virtually eliminated. <T3>Prevention of Cross Contamination and Cross Drafts.</T3> As indicatedabove, the blast furnace at Company D is not being effectively controlled.Evidence in the record suggests that cross contamination from the blastfurnace, and perhaps to a lesser extent from the scrapyard, currently iscreating excess exposure levels in the Maerz and shaft furnace areas, amongothers. OSHA does not believe that the copper used in these two furnaceoperations, which contains no more than 1% lead (Ex. 684d, p. 3), can byitself produce such high exposure levels. OSHA believes that eliminatingcross contamination is technologically feasible. As Company D itself recognizes (site omitted to protect confidentiality),cross contamination is the source of higher air lead levels in the castingoperation, as well. In casting, where the lead content of the highly refinedcopper is between .08-.2% (Ex. 684d, p. 3), air lead levels should be low(Ex. 475-32D, pp. 22-23). In fact, the geometric mean exposure level incasting is 41.2 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and 38% of the samples in casting are above50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, Ex. 2). OSHA considers exposure levels in castingto be approximately equal to the increment in exposure levels broadly causedby cross contamination. Thus, by controlling cross contamination, exposurelevels in various operations and areas generally would be reduced to theextent of the geometric mean exposure level in the casting area. OSHA conservatively determines that the appropriate increment derived fromthe casting area as attributable to cross contamination is approximately37 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA believes this is conservative because it excludesfrom the computation higher exposure levels relating to certain maintenancework and to the transfer and holding of the molten metal in the castingarea. After adjusting monitoring results from the shaft and Maerz furnace areas,for example, to factor out cross contamination OSHA finds geometric meansof approximately 52 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 41 andCx.18;g/m\3\, respectively, beforeadditional controls are implemented (see Table 2 below).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,10,10</C><T4>Table</T4> 2._1984-1987<T4> Workers' Exposure Data of Company D_Adjusted Values by Using CastingArea as Background \1\</T4><H1>Area</H1><H1>Geometric Mean w/cross contamination</H1><H1>Geometric Mean w/o cross contamination</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Shaft Furnace <D>88.6 </D><D>51.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maerz Furnace <D>78.0 </D><D>41.0 </D><F>\1\ Source: Ex. 686C, Ex. 2.</F></ITAG></ITAG> There are at least two reasons for this cross contamination. First, CompanyD has failed to adequately control lead exposures at their primary source,the blast furnace area. Second, cross drafts exist, which drive the leadfume and dust escaping from the blast furnace throughout the plant (Ex.475-32, pp. 19, 22-23). These cross drafts occur because Company D, whichhas a large open building with a very hot smelting process, relies tooheavily upon natural ventilation and some ceiling fans to control exposurelevels. Not only do these cross drafts spread contamination from one operationto another, but they also disrupt local exhaust ventilation, thereby preventingexhaust hoods from operating at maximum capacity. OSHA's evaluation ofthe complex, plant-wide problems that cross drafts create is substantiatedby the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' book,<T3>Industrial Ventilation</T3>, which states that ``[c]ross drafts notonly interfere with the proper operation of exhaust hoods, but may alsodisperse contaminated air from one section of the building into anotherand can interfere with the proper operation of process equipment * * *''(Ex. 583-13, p. 7-2). To remedy this problem, as well as others, OSHA believes that the firstthing that Company D and the industry must do is to conduct a plant-wideindustrial hygiene study which focuses in part on analyzing cross draftsand cross contamination as a basis for designing cross-draft barriers andother measures to eliminate them. Erecting cross-draft barriers at properlocations not only will control cross contamination, but also will increasethe efficiency of exhaust hoods. This will result in an appreciable reductionof air lead levels in all areas, as sources of lead extraneous to an operationare eliminated and as control of sources of lead intrinsic to the operationis enhanced. OSHA is confident that such a study is essential to systematically controllingair lead levels in the industry. OSHA's determination is further supportedby Dr. Knowlton Caplan, a well-known engineering consultant to the leadindustry, who has said that engineering controls should be designed withindustrial hygiene problems in mind (Ex. 582-89, Appendix). However, thereappear to have been few or no industrial hygiene studies in this industryto help employers control the exposures of their employees.At Company D, for example, no such study has ever been made. No industrialhygienist is employed in its abatement program. After certain controlswere identified and installed in the early 1980s to abate air lead levelsto 200 andCx.18;g/m\3\, no industrial hygiene study was carried out to analyzetheir effectiveness. No study was conducted concerning the problems ofcross drafts and cross contamination. OSHA believes consultation with anexperienced industrial hygienist could help to resolve such problems inexpensively.Preventing cross contamination is the single most important step that canbe taken to reduce exposure levels generally throughout the plant. An engineeringreport based on conditions in a secondary copper smelter confirms OSHA'sview that the blast furnace is the major source of lead emissions. Thisreport states that the charging door and tapping point on the blast furnaceare responsible for most of the lead emissions in the facility (Ex. 475-32D,H-004E, p. 42). In addition to preventing cross contamination, other conventionalcontrols that are applicable to many operations also should be implementedto broadly reduce exposure levels in secondary copper smelters. These includebetter ventilation, enclosure, isolation, housekeeping, and maintenance.<T3>Ventilation. </T3>The presence of excessive lead in the work environmentsof secondary copper smelters indicates that engineering controls like totalenclosure, local exhaust ventilation (LEV), and general ventilation arenot doing the job. As previously stated, where ventilation is inadequate,cross contamination can become a serious problem. Although much more quantitativeand other information than industry has provided would be needed to statewith any precision how much reduction of particular exposure levels shouldbe achieved by enhancing specific ventilation systems, OSHA has no doubtthat in some operations improved or additional ventilation can achievemajor reductions in worker exposure. For example, reductions in exposurelevels can be achieved in the blast furnace area by increasing the captureefficiency of the hood over the blast furnace so that it will prevent theescape of large quantities of fume into the facility during the upsetsthat are reported to occur as often as twice a week (Ex. 684d, p. 16) andby providing exhaust ventilation for the launder or for ladle transferand ladle preheating (Ex. 568, p. 12). <T3>Enclosure and Isolation.</T3> Enclosure and isolation are two alternativemethods of separating workers from air contaminants. In the case of isolation,the employee is physically separated from contaminants in the air (e.g.,by working in a filtered, ventilated control booth). With enclosure, thesource of the contaminant is physically contained and separated from therest of the work environment to prevent contamination of the air (e.g.,placing equipment or dirty processes within an enclosure) (Ex. 568, p.13). Company D reports that it has ``positive-pressure control rooms [that]are available to some employees'' (Ex. 684d, p. 15). However, as demonstratedby employee exposures in Company D's blast furnace area, these controlrooms in practice have not been adequate to control the exposure levelsof most employees (Ex. 684d, Ex. 2). Docket entries describe standard enclosure techniques that are in use inthe industry or can be readily implemented (e.g., enclosing launders tostop fumes from escaping) (Exs. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 19; 686C, p. 13). Simpleisolation techniques that have been successfully used in certain plantsin this industry and in plants in other lead industries also are applicablethroughout this industry (e.g., providing employees with filtered, ventilatedcabs for mobile equipment and fresh air islands, isolation booths and controlrooms) (Ex. 686C, pp. 11-14). Isolating workers, even for a portion oftheir shift, can significantly reduce exposure levels (Ex. 686C, p. 14;see also Ex. 568, p. 11). For example, a Radian study of a secondary lead smelter demonstrates thatemployee exposures can be reduced by 23-77% even when employees spend onlya portion of the workday in an isolation booth (Ex. 583-16, Vol. 1, p.30). Another study, by the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH), investigating the effectiveness of various control technologiesin secondary lead smelters, reports that workers spending even one-quarterof their time in a supplied air island would experience a 20% reductionin overall 8-hour TWA exposure (Ex. 590, p. 40). Consequently, for example,a fresh air station could be installed in various operations where neededto reduce remaining excess exposures after other controls were implemented(e.g., Ex. 686C, p. 15). <T3>Housekeeping, Work Practices, and Preventive Maintenance. </T3>Housekeeping,work practices, and preventive maintenance are essential controls whoseimportance frequently is not adequately recognized by employers. Failureto develop and use rigorous housekeeping, good work practices, and preventivemaintenance can destroy the effectiveness of otherwise adequate engineeringcontrols The importance of housekeeping was stressed in a report prepared by theCadre Corporation for the Southwire Copper Company, a secondary coppersmelter (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 58). The Cadre report states,<ITAG tagnum="21">[Housekeeping] is definitely the most underrated aspect of any fumeabatement program. In any industrial facility there will be some amountof particulate in the air. Sooner or later this particulate is going tosettle out on the plant floor, equipment and materials. If this dust isnot collected and disposed of then it will become airborne again due tobuilding drafts, mobile machinery traffic and numerous other disturbances.The housekeeping component of the abatement plan is a vital link in thesuccess of the project. By neglecting to properly control settled particulateany gains made by capturing fugitive emissions will be minimal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, p. 58)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA agrees. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of goodhousekeeping and work practices. Nevertheless, housekeeping at the Company D plant was so inadequate thatMeridian, based on its site visit, substantially downgraded its assessmentof the current level of housekeeping in secondary copper smelters (Ex.686C, p. 13). Prior to that site visit, Meridian had assumed that secondarycopper smelters utilized good housekeeping practices (Ex. 573, p. 28).After the visit, Meridian concluded that housekeeping needs to be substantiallyimproved for the industry to meet 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, p. 16) To improve housekeeping, OSHA specifically recommends the following. Avacuum system should be installed in copper smelters that do not have adequatevacuuming facilities so that spillage and settled dust can be vacuumeddaily from surfaces. Such a system was recommended by Dr. Caplan for Amax'ssecondary copper smelter at Carteret, New Jersey (Ex. 668E, p. 11). Drysweeping, particularly in the scrapyard, should be prohibited. HEPA-filteredvacuum floor sweepers and central HEPA-filtered vacuums should be useddaily to control workstation dust. In addition, at least annually each secondary copper smelter should thoroughlyclean its entire facility, including rafters. The expert panel estimatesthat such a cleaning would reduce exposure levels of workers throughoutthe facility by 10-25% (Ex. 686C, p. 19). At Company D, management statedthat such a cleaning has never been undertaken (Ex. 684d, p. 17). Detailed housekeeping instructions should be prepared and adherence tothem enforced by employers, with scheduling and checkoff of regular cleaningof all areas of the plant where dust can collect. If necessary, the housekeepinginstructions should list hundreds of sites, pieces of equipment, partsof equipment, obscure corners, etc., to assure that they are cleaned regularly.In addition to implementing good work practices for housekeeping and cleanupof fines and slag, work practices should be written to prescribe correctprocedures for all tasks that might result in increased employee exposure.At Company D, for example, a worker was seen standing next to the slaghole of the holding furnace, one of the highest emission sources at thissmelter, when the employee's work did not require his presence there. Improvedwork practices would dictate that the employee remove himself from proximityto the source of exposure whenever possible and, to the extent possible,isolate himself from contaminants in a fresh-air island or the like. CompanyD states that it trains its employees not to stand near furnace doors,etc., when employees are not required to be there (Ex. 684d, p. 17). However,based on the site visit to Company D, it appears that management does notenforce the workpractices taught to workers during training. Better workpractices that reduce the frequency of upsets during blast furnace chargingcould also substantially decrease exposure levels in the blast furnaceand resulting cross contamination. Mr. Melvin Cassady, OSHA's expert on smelting, has stressed the importanceof maintenance programs to assure that all systems function as cleanlyand as efficiently as practicable. In addition to the actions recommendedabove, Mr. Cassady specifically suggested the following: 1. Preventive maintenance for belt conveying systems; 2. Maintenance of clean air stations to retain their effectiveness; 3. Regular cleaning and maintenance of positive-pressure; filtered-airsystems in cabs of mobile equipment; 4. Periodic checks for, and prompt repair of leaks in baghouses; and 5. Daily checks on the pressure of baghouses and prompt replacement ofruptured bags (Ex. 604, pp. 2, 4, 7, 14). In addition to the above controls, OSHA specifically recommends additionalcontrols operation by operation. <T3>Blast Furnace.</T3> The blast furnace is the source of the highestlead exposure levels in secondary copper smelting and is the most difficultarea to control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Exposure levels within the blast furnace area exceed 50 mg/m\3\ for a varietyof reasons, including lack of exhaust ventilation (e.g., on the launderand during ladle transfer), inadequate ventilation (e.g., inadequate captureefficiency on the blast furnace hood), lack of isolation or enclosure (e.g.,absence of fresh air islands), ``upsets'' that frequently occur duringthe charging process, and, to a lesser degree, some cross contaminationfrom the scrapyard and reentrainment of dust from the blast furnace areaitself (Ex. 686C, pp. 9, 10, 13-15).OSHA believes that if the additional controls recommended by the expertpanel of certified industrial hygienists (Ex. 686C, pp. 9-10, 13-15) andby OSHA are implemented, exposure levels within the blast furnace willbe controlled to or below 50 mg/m\3\ in at least 50% of the operationsmost of the time. These controls include installation of local exhaustventilation at all furnace openings, improving the capture efficiency ofthe hood over the charging door to capture fumes generated during upsets,installation of enclosed filtered-air booths or supplied-air islands foroperators having permanent stations near furnaces, use of controls to reduceemissions during the transfer of molten material (e.g., traveling hoodsfor ladles and hoods or enclosures for launders), and improved work practices(e.g., to reduce or eliminate exposures caused when workers unnecessarilyremain near the furnace openings).When upsets occur at the blast furnace, as occurred during OSHA's sitevisit to Company D, clouds of smoke and fumes may fill the entire smelterarea, notwithstanding the enclosure and canopy at the charging point (Ex.684d, p. 15). These upsets, typically occurring as often as twice a week,undoubtedly are an important cause of the high exposure levels in the blastfurnace and other areas throughout the facility. Standard work proceduresshould be implemented to minimize or prevent upsets during charging, suchas adjusting the volume and rate of feeding of the charge and better qualitycontrol over the materials included in the charge. In addition, as discussedabove, the capture efficiency of the hood over the charging door must beenlarged to accommodate the few upsets that remain. During upsets, OSHArecognizes that it generally will be necessary for affected employees towear respirators.The cabs on mobile equipment in the blast furnace area also should be enclosedand equipped with HEPA filters. Employees in the blast furnace area shouldbe encouraged to use the existing ventilated control room whenever possibleand additionally a supplied air island should be provided for the blastfurnace operator. The expert panel expects that greater use of the controlroom by blast furnace operators, combined with the shift to filtered makeupair, should reduce exposure levels by 5-25% (Ex. 686C, pp. 9-10).Several other controls can reduce lead exposure levels for employees inthe blast furnace area. Providing exhaust ventilation for ladle transfer,ladle preheating, and cast pot staging is expected to reduce employee exposuresby an additional 9-15% (Ex. 686C, p. 20). In conjunction with expectedreductions from better dust control in the scrapyard, which is expectedto reduce employee exposure levels in this area by 10%, employee exposuresin the blast furnace area are expected to be reduced by a total of 34-50%,according to the expert panel (Ex. 686C, p. 20).If the panel's recommendations for the blast furnace area are implemented,4 operations in this area, in addition to the 3 operations with geometricmeans already below 50 mg/m\3\, will have midpoint geometric means below50 mg/m\3\, for a total of 7 of 14 operations within the blast furnacearea that are below 50 mg/m\3\. Two more operations also will have midpointgeometric means below 53 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, p. 18), for a total of 9 operationsbelow 53 mg/m\3\. An additional 3 operations will have midpoint geometricmeans below 70 mg/m\3\. Thus, 12 of 14 operations within the blast furnacearea are expected to be below 70 mg/m\3\, and the other 2 operations areexpected to have midpoint geometric means below 93 mg/m\3\ (Ex. 686C, p.21). Where all feasible engineering and work practice controls have beenimplemented and employees performing tasks in the blast furnace area likemaintaining the tap hole and sample preparation are still exposed abovethe 50 mg/m\3\ PEL as an 8-hour TWA, employers will be required to providethese workers with respirators for supplemental protection while they areperforming such tasks.OSHA recognizes that these are estimates, not precise calculations of reductionsin exposure levels that can be expected with additional controls. Nonetheless,OSHA believes these estimates are important since they indicate that, evenin many of the dirtiest operations, control of employee exposure levelsto 50 mg/m\3\ can be reasonably anticipated without major overhaul or restructuringof facilities. OSHA further believes these estimates are conservative sincethey are based upon a limited, rather than an exhaustive list of recommendedadditional controls.When the molten metal leaves the blast furnace area it undergoes the firstof several transfers between furnaces. The transfer of molten metal canbe an important source of lead emissions in the blast and other furnaceareas. Consequently, control of the transfer is vital, as industry engineeringconsultants Dr. Caplan and Cadre Corporation have recognized (Exs. 475-32D,H-004E, p. 50; 668E, p. 12). Effective control of such transfers is notroutinely implemented in secondary copper smelters, as Meridian pointsout (Ex. 686C, p. 14). The preferred method for accomplishing such transfersis by a transfer chute called a launder, because from an industrial hygienepoint of view a launder can be fully and easily enclosed, thus completelycontaining the lead fumes. Company D uses an uncovered launder to transfermolten metal from the blast furnace to the holding furnace. The launderhas a hood only at the end transfer point into the holding furnace. CompanyD also relies upon ladles with no observable controls for metal transfersfrom the holding furnace to the converter furnace and from the converterto the shaft and Maerz furnaces. The expert panel estimates that emissionsfrom these transfers can be reduced by 75-95% by implementing well-designedlocal exhaust ventilation (Ex. 686C, p. 15).<T3>Holding Furnace.</T3> At Company D only some sources of emission inthe holding furnace area are effectively controlled. Additional ventilationand enclosures are needed. For example, the slag hole is not currentlyequipped with an exhaust hood. The company says it did not ventilate theslag hole because of the absence of visible emissions. However, becauselead fume is not always visible, and because of very high employee exposurelevels at the slag hole, the company should install local exhaust ventilationat this furnace opening.Additional controls that should be implemented to control emissions inthe holding furnace area include enclosure and ventilation of the ladleor launder, which is used to transfer molten metal to the converter; localexhaust ventilation for the slag testing area; and regular clean up oflead-bearing slag from the work area. These controls are expected to reducethe exposure of the copper/slag hole operator by 40-65%, according to theexpert panel (Ex. 686C, p. 14).By more effectively controlling exposure levels in the scrapyard and eliminatingcross contamination from the yard, workers' exposure levels in the holdingfurnace area will be further reduced by 5-10%, according to the expertpanel (Ex. 686C, p. 13).<T3>Converter. </T3>Converting is carried out at the high temperature of2,000anddegrees;F. Cracks and leaks in the furnace commonly occur due tohigh temperatures. Converters should be relined with firebrick regularlyto keep them tight and leakproof. In Japan, for example, they are relinedevery 100 days (Ex. 689-1, p. 68).Leaks of off-gases during air blowing are the principal source of emissionsduring converter operations. Such leaks can occur despite the fact thatprimary hoods collect the bulk of emissions. Secondary hoods are needed,therefore, to capture the off-gases. Secondary hooding can be accomplishedeither by totally enclosing the converter or installing a push/pull ventiliationsystem, as the secondary lead smelting industry has already done successfully(Exs. 604, p. 12; 689-1, p. 155).In addition, where feasible, the ladles used in converter aisles shouldbe exhausted by employing the Hawley Trav-L-Vent device, which has proveneffective in controlling exposure levels in primary copper smelters andmany other lead industries in the United States (Ex. 604).Better dust control in the scrapyard will further reduce workers' exposurelevels in this area by 5-10%, according to the expert panel (Ex. 686C,p. 13).<T3>Maerz (Reverberatory) and Shaft Furnaces. </T3>As indicated above,solely with the elimination of cross contamination from the blast furnacearea, the geometric mean employee exposure levels at the Maerz and shaftfurnaces will be reduced to 41 mg/m\3\ and 51.6 mg/m\3\, respectively.These exposure levels should be achieved even before any additional controlsare implemented to control sources of emission at those furnaces.Additional controls such as covering or locally exhausting ladles or launderswould further reduce workers' exposure levels by 3-5%, according to theexpert panel (Ex. 686C, p. 15). Further, better dust controls in the scrapyardwould reduce workers' exposures in the furnace areas by an additional 5%(Ex. 686C, p. 13). Better housekeeping would reduce exposures by another15-25% (Ex. 686C, p 20). Thus, the total reduction anticipated by the expertpanel from implementing these additional controls is 23-35%.Cumulating the anticipated reductions from controlling cross contaminationfrom the blast furnace and the scrapyard with the anticipated reductionsfrom implementing additional controls in the furnacs areas, OSHA findsthat of the 8 job categories listed for these furnaces, 7 will have geometricmeans below 49 mg/m\3\. Moreover, it appears that the eighth category,shaft furnace operator, no longer exists (Ex. 686C, pp. 5, 25). In otherwords, average geometric mean exmployee exposure levels would range fromnegligible to 48.8 mg/m\3\ in the Maerz furnace area and from 10.4-37.2mg/m\3\ in the shaft furnace area.OSHA believes that increased preventive maintenance is the key to stillfurther reducing air lead levels at the Maerz furnace, specifically bymaking the furnace roof tighter and more leakproof. In Japan, for example,very few cracks occur because the insides of Maerz furnace roofs are coatedfrequently to make them essentially leakproof (Ex. 689-1, p. 112). Appropriatesilica refractory sealants are commercially available in the United States,which have been applied successfully to seal top leaks of Maerz furnacesin secondary lead smelters in this country (Ex. 604, p. 11).As a result of implementing all the above controls, OSHA has no doubt thatemployee exposure levels can be consistently controlled to or below 50mg/m\3\ in the Maerz and shaft furnaces.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 3<T4>._ Present Exposure Levels and Anticipated Exposure Levels in the Maerzand Shaft Furnaces at Company D</T4>  <H1>Job category </H1><H1>Geometric mean exposure (andCx.18;g/m\3\)</H1><H1>Geometric mean exposure adjusted for cross contamination</H1><H1>Ranges of geometric mean after additional controls applied and adjustmentfor cross contamination</H1>  Shaft Furnace: <ITAG tagnum="3">General </ITAG><D>85.3 </D><D>48.3 </D><D>31.4-37.2 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Operator </ITAG><D>(\1\) 318.2</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Supervisor </ITAG><D>53 </D><D>16 </D><D>10.4-12.3 </D>Maerz Furnace: <ITAG tagnum="3">Operator </ITAG><D>100.4 </D><D>63.4 </D><D>41.2-48.8 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Assistant </ITAG><D>88.4 </D><D>51.4 </D><D>33.4-39.6 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Loader </ITAG><D>21</D><D>(\2\)</D><D>(\2\) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Barco Operator </ITAG><D>65.7 </D><D>28.7 </D><D>18.7-22.1 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Supervisor </ITAG><D>41.2 </D><D>4.2 </D><D>2.7-3.2  </D><F>\1\ Shaft furnace operator job category no longer exists (Ex. 686C,pp. 5, 25). </F><F>\2\ Extremely low exposure levels, approximately equivalent to backgroundlevels or 0 andCx.18;g/m\3\.</F></ITAG> <T3>Casting Area.</T3> As previously shown, in the casting operation themolten copper is more than 99% pure. Whatever significant exposure levelshave been found in this operation, therefore, generally must be due tocross contamination from the blast furnace and scrapyard (Ex. 475-32D,H-004E, pp. 19, 22-23, 42). With the elimination of cross contamination,air lead levels in the casting operation should be negligible. <T3>Scrap and Charge Preparation.</T3> In the scrapyard and briquettingplant, the vast majority of sampling results already are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Modest improvements in controls would further control exposure levels.Strict control of sources of lead emission in the scrapyard is importantnot only to protect scrapyard employees but also to eliminate one sourceof cross contamination in the plant. To stop cross contamination from thescrapyard, the expert panel recommends that Company D install baffles,screens or walls to prevent dispersion of lead-bearing dust from scrap(Ex. 686C, p. 13). To further reduce exposure levels for scrapyard employees, OSHA has determinedthat wet sweeping should be used instead of street sweepers. This wouldreduce worker exposure in this area by up to 5%, according to the expertpanel (Ex. 686C, p. 9). In addition, cabs of forklift trucks and front-endloaders should be enclosed and equipped with a filtered and tempered airsupply, as is common practice in secondary lead smelters (Ex. 604, pp.2, 4). This would reduce operators' exposure levels well below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.Operators should be provided with audio communication systems if theirtasks require communication with other personnel. <T3>Baghouse and Control of Cross Contamination.</T3> Baghouses can bea significant source of dust if they are not operated and maintained properly.Industry consultants, Dr. Caplan (Ex. 668E, p. 12 of enclosure) and CadreCorporation (Ex. 475-32D, H-004E, pp. 53-54), have recognized this in recommendingto secondary copper smelters that they improve dust suppression at theirbaghouses. During OSHA's site visit to Company D, management representatives concededthat 3 of the 4 baghouses in the plant were not in good condition and thatreplacing them, along with modifying the roof, would contribute more thanany other single control measure to reducing air lead levels of employeesin the plant (Ex. 684d, p. 18). OSHA agrees that replacing these baghouseswould significantly contribute to reducing air lead levels in the facility.Running efficient baghouses is essential not only to reducing exposuresto baghouse workers, but also to maintaining an effective ventilation systemand to preventing cross contamination from baghouses to the entire facility(Ex. 686C, p. 29). To keep baghouses clean and operating efficiently the following engineeringcontrols and work practices should be strictly implemented: 1. Baghouses should be repaired and maintained to eliminate leaks and assureproper functioning of cleaning mechanisms; 2. Baghouses should be shielded from wind by erecting barriers; and 3. Dust-packaging operations should be ventilated (Ex. 573, p. 27). OSHA also recommends that automatic dust-packaging systems that use mechanizedmaterial handling equipment, such as screw conveyors, should be installedwhen plants are being modernized. Repair and maintenance of the baghouse is an intermittent maintenance activity.In certain repair and maintenance tasks it may not be feasible to controlair lead levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by engineering and work practice controls.Under such circumstances, OSHA recognizes that it may be necessary forworkers to wear respirators for supplemental protection while performingthese tasks.<T3>Technological Feasibility. </T3>Based on the above analysis of theevidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, the Agencydetermines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineeringand work practice controls is technologically feasible in the secondarycopper smelting industry as a whole. Nevertheless, the Agency recognizes that it may not be possible to consistentlyachieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL by these controls for certain employeesin the blast furnace area, like those who maintain the tap hole and carryout sample preparation. Since OSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL feasiblefor the industry, employers will be required in these tasks, as well, toimplement engineering and work practice controls to control exposure levelsto the PEL or the lowest feasible level. Where all feasible engineeringand work practice controls have been implemented and employees performingthese tasks are still exposed above the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL as an 8-hourTWA, employers will be required to provide these workers with respiratorsfor supplemental protection while they perform such tasks. To sum up, OSHA has shown the following. In 2 of 5 operations at CompanyD, casting and miscellaneous, both the geometric means and more than 60%of all sampling results already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In 2more operations, the shaft and Maerz furnaces, geometric means also willbe below 52 andCx.18;g/m\3\ once cross contamination has been eliminated.These levels can be achieved even before recommended additional controlsare implemented to control sources of continuing lead emission within thesefurnace areas. After implementation of additional controls in both furnaces,geometric mean exposure levels in all job categories but one will be reducedbelow 40 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In that one job category the geometric mean willbe below 49 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In the other operation, the blast furnace, after recommended controls areimplemented, exposure levels in 9 of the 14 associated job categories willbe below or just slightly above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and in 3 others levelswill be below 70 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Thus, in only 2 of 14 blast furnance categoriesare exposure levels expected to remain above 70 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In operationswhere it is infeasible to reduce exposure levels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\by means of engineering and work practice controls and under many ``upset''conditions, OSHA recognizes that it may be necessary for workers to wearrespirators for supplementary protection. OSHA also wishes to point out that all of its recommendations for achieving50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ rely exclusively upon conventional and readily availablecontrols. OSHA has not needed to exercise its statutory authority to forcethe development of new technology in this industry to justify its findingof feasibility. Based on the foregoing, OSHA believes that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievablemost of the time in most of the operations in secondary copper smelting.In reaching this conclusion, OSHA does not purport to have recommendedan exhaustive list of additional controls. The Agency is certain that industrywill be capable of devising and finetuning various controls to furtherreduce exposure levels. Consequently, OSHA anticipates that industry willbe able to consistently achieve exposure levels at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in nearly every phase of production. OSHA believes that these levels will be attainable by implementing an integratedsystem of controls. The basic element in that system is an industrial hygienestudy. Each smelter is required by paragraph (e)(3) of the lead standard(29 CFR 1910.1025) to establish and implement a written compliance planfor achieving the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL, which includes an in-depth job/taskanalysis and a plant wide survey. This survey and analysis should be performedby an experienced industrial hygienist who shall identify sources of emissionin each task, sources of cross drafts and sources of cross contamination,and appropriate sites for erecting barriers to prevent cross contamination.Such an analysis should also recommend appropriate engineering and workpractice controls to reduce emissions and minimize employee exposures.If, after implementing these recommendations, reductions in air lead levelsdeviate substantially from what was anticipated, a followup industrialhygiene evaluation should be conducted and necessary corrections made.The second element in that system is the development of good written housekeepingand work practice programs, as required by paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of thelead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025), which shall be systematically implementedso that proper procedures are routinely and meticulously followed. Forexample, wall-to-wall cleanings should be conducted at least annually.The final element of an integrated system of controls is a preventive maintenanceprogram to assure that all systems are maintained in clean and efficientcondition. The secondary copper smelting industry does not agree that a PEL of 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically feasible. Industry's disagreement is basedon 6 main points. First, and most generally, industry maintains there is insufficient evidencein the record to support a determination of technological feasibility.Second, industry portrays Meridian and its reports as incompetent and biased.Third, industry claims that Company D is not representative of the restof the industry and that even the more modernized Company D has been unable,after the expenditure of millions of dollars, to consistently achieve 200andCx.18;g/m\3\, let alone 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Fourth, industry alleges thatthe lead smelting industry has proven incapable of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,that OSHA has acknowledged that fact, and that it is more difficult tocontrol exposure levels in copper smelting than in lead smelting. Fifth,industry states that several consultants, like JACA (Ex. 553-5) and Dr.Caplan (Ex. 668E, p. 2), as well as OSHA in a 1983 draft, previously concludedthat a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is technologically infeasible in secondarycopper smelting. Sixth, industry claims that NIOSH and others have recognizedthat an integrated system of controls, including some reliance upon respirators,is needed to achieve the PEL throughout secondary copper smelting. This,industry asserts, amounts to an acknowledgement that achieving the PELby engineering and work practice controls alone is infeasible (Exhibits582-89, 680, 694-39). OSHA has considered these arguments but finds themunpersuasive. First, OSHA's statutory obligation is to make its determination on thebest available evidence in the record. OSHA has actively sought to collectand develop a full and accurate record. OSHA is persuaded that it has morethan enough current information and data upon which to base its feasibilitydetermination. OSHA believes that there would be still more usable informationand data in the record had industry not declined to testify at the publichearing and to subject itself to cross examination by OSHA and others.In pursuit of fully developing the record, OSHA took the unusual step ofmaking a site visit to a secondary copper smelter after the public hearing.Second, industry criticizes Meridian's efforts as perfunctory, preconceived,unsupportable and generally incompetent. Industry claims the site visitto Company D was ``window dressing'' and criticizes OSHA and Meridian fornot performing air monitoring during the site visit. OSHA rejects thesecriticisms and believes that Meridian did a creditable job given time andresource constraints. Meridian has had extensive experience conductingindustrial hygiene analyses and assessing factors relevant to feasibility.If its experience in secondary copper smelting in particular is limited,the industrial hygiene and engineering principles utilized by Meridianare applicable to all industries, and the technology referred to is bothused in copper smelting and transferrable from analogous industries. Meridian's final report (Ex. 686C) and its conclusions are based on datain the record submitted by Company D, a site visit to Company D in whichtwo experienced and certified industrial hygienists participated, and recommendationsby a panel of three experienced and certified industrial hygienists, includingtwo who had been on the site visit. The fact that, after analyzing additional data and participating in thesite visit, Meridian confirmed its earlier conclusions does not indicatepreconception or bias. Indeed, based upon evidence developed after thehearing, Meridian changed its mind about several points and revised itsmethodology Meridian found, for example, that housekeeping was much worsethan it had anticipated. Similarly, after analyzing the array of exposuredata, Meridian utilized geometric means because this is the most accurateway to portray that data (Ex. 686C, pp. 2, 6). None of this suggests thatMeridian was operating in a perfunctory or biased manner. On the contrary,Meridian invested considerable effort in assembling its expert panel ofcertified industrial hygienists and assuring that the expert panel wouldmake specific recommendations for additional controls and assessments ofreductions in air lead levels to be expected from implementing such controls.Meridian's revisions and conclusions are firmly grounded in the record.In any event, OSHA has independently assessed the record, reviewed Meridian'sfinal report for accuracy and relied only in part upon that report forits feasibility determination.With regard to the site visit to Company D, air monitoring was not conductedduring the site visit for two reasons. First, four years of exposure datacurrent to September, 1987, had already been submitted to the record byCompany D. Second, in response to industry's demand. OSHA had previouslyagreed in writing as a precondition for the visit not to conduct air monitoring.Consequently, conducting air sampling during the site visit was neithernecessary nor permitted. OSHA also notes that OSHA and Meridian, in thecompany of two independent, certified industrial hygienists, toured CompanyD and investigated conditions there. In addition, staff at OSHA and Meridianspent numerous hours preparing for the site visit by reading an engineeringreport on the plant and analyzing Company D's exposure data.Third, industry says Company D uses state-of-the-art technology that isnot representative of the rest of the industry and that even after spendingmillions of dollars Company D cannot consistently achieve 200 mg/m\3\,let alone 50 mg/m\3\. Industry further alleges that some of the additionalcontrols Meridian recommends for Company D are already in place.In response, OSHA first notes that the controls at Company D can hardlybe said to be state of the art, since so many emissions sources (launder,ladles, tapping holes, slag sampling stations, etc.) are without controlsat that facility. OSHA further wishes to emphasize that the fact that CompanyD may have more controls in place than other smelters does not make itan inappropriate choice for determining technological feasibility in thisindustry. As counsel for the Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries,which represents secondary copper smelters, among others, himself has pointedout, to prove feasibility OSHA need only prove a <T3>reasonable possibility</T3> that a typical firm <T3>will be able to develop and install</T3> engineering and work practicecontrols that can meet the PEL in most of its operations (Ex. 680, p. 12).In this case, OSHA has gone much further than that by showing that CompanyD, relying entirely on currently existing conventional controls, can consistentlyachieve air lead levels of 50 mg/m\3\.Indeed, OSHA has shown that merely by controlling cross contamination CompanyD can reduce employee air lead levels to approximately 50 mg/m\3\, in allareas but the blast furnace. No evidence in the record, other than unsupportedindustry statements, provides any basis for believing that the additionalcontrols recommended by OSHA could not be implemented across the industry.Industry had every opportunity to submit such technological evidence toshow that Company D is not typical in this sense, but has not done so.With regard to the allegation that Company D and the industry, even afterspending large amounts of money, are incapable of consistently achievinglevels below 200 mg/m\3\, OSHA notes that more than 80% of all samplesat Company D already are under 200 mg/m\3\ and 94% of all samples outsidethe blast furnace area are below 200 mg/m\3\. OSHA recognizes that CompanyD has spent a considerable amount of money to modernize its plant. However,the Agency believes that in spending this money Company D neglected tobase its design of additional controls on an industrial hygiene surveyand neglected to engage an industrial hygienist to analyze resulting monitoringdata (Ex. 684d, p. 17). Consequently, OSHA is not surprised that CompanyD has not achieved the anticipated reductions in employee air lead levelsby implementing certain controls (Ex. 684d, pp. 17-18).Although Company D suggests that it has relied on an engineer ``with certainqualifications'' to conduct and review its air monitoring (Ex. 684d, p.3), Company D has failed to take the most basic, necessary steps to understandand correct its own problems. Company D does not know the sources and extentof exposure in each task, has done little to eliminate cross contamination,and has sought to control only those sources of lead where emissions arehigh enough to be visible. Only with a better understanding of its exposureproblems from an industrial hygiene perspective can Company D be in a positionto implement the kind of integrated system of controls that is needed tocomply with the lead standard.If it is true, as industry asserts, that a few of the many additional controlsrecommended by Meridian already exist in some parts of the Company D facility,those controls appear to have been largely ineffective. OSHA believes theyhave been ineffective because the company has failed to design or implementsuch controls from an industrial hygiene perspective. Without that understanding,no amount of money spent on exposure problems will adequately control employeeexposure levels. Developing a compliance plan for achieving the 50 mg/m\3\PEL in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of the leadstandard should rectify this situation.Fourth, industry's claim that primary and secondary lead smelters havebeen unable to achieve 50 mg/m\3\ through engineering and work practicecontrols, that OSHA has acknowledged this infeasibility and that secondarycopper is even more difficult to control, is wrong in every respect. First,as indicated at the hearing, some secondary smelters have achieved 50 mg/m\3\(Tr, pp. 156-58). Second, primary lead smelters are under no obligationto achieve 50 mg/m\3\ by engineering and work practice controls until 1991.The fact, therefore, that these smelters to date may not have done so isnot evidence of their inability to do so.Next, OSHA has never acknowledged that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is infeasible inlead smelting. The court has held that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is feasible inlead smelting and industry is obligated to comply with the PEL by meansof engineering and work practice controls. It is incorrect to treat OSHA'sCooperative Assessment Plans (CAP) and Tripartite Agreements as tantamountto recognition by OSHA of infeasibility in lead smelters (and lead batterymanufacturers). On the contrary, these agreements presume that 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\is generally feasible and that industry's obligation is to use engineeringand work practice controls to reduce air lead levels in all operationsdown to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or, in those few operations where it is demonstratedthat 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved, to reduce air lead levels tothe lowest feasible level. In essence, the CAP and Tripartite agreementsare mutually agreed-upon compliance plans for implementing engineeringand work practice controls to achieve these levels. Industry is also incorrect when it asserts that OSHA in any way recognizedthe infeasibility of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by engineering and workpractice controls through Agency action modifying the lead standard toauthorize supplemental use of respirators where it is infeasible to achieve50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ through engineering and work practice controls. OSHA'sstandard operating procedure has been to allow the use of respirators whereit is infeasible for the employer to achieve the PEL by engineering andwork practice controls. Thus, OSHA has not expanded the authorized useof respirators since the lead standard was promulgated. Finally, OSHA believes it is more difficult to control air lead levelsto 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practice controlsin primary and secondary lead smelters than in secondary copper smelters.Although it is true that temperatures are higher in copper than lead smelters,nevertheless, for several reasons, problems are much greater in lead smelters.In secondary copper smelters there is only one source of lead, copper scrap.The portion of lead in the copper scrap generally is below 10% and oftenis much lower. The purpose of copper smelting is to remove the limitednumber of impurities in the copper scrap to produce a nearly pure copperproduct. By the time that product arrives at the shaft and Maerz furnaces,the remaining lead is no more than 1% of the copper. By contrast, the purpose of lead smelting is to produce lead. The mainraw material is lead ore in primary smelters and lead scrap in secondarylead smelters. As the product is refined, it becomes purer and purer lead.Thus, in lead smelters the sources of lead are ubiquitous, and the leadcontent rises throughout the process. In secondary copper smelters, however,the source of lead is very limited to start with and the lead content decreasesthroughout the production process. Fifth, OSHA disagrees that JACA or the Agency previously found a PEL of50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ technologically infeasible in the secondary copper smeltingindustry. JACA's analysis focused almost exclusively upon economic, nottechnological feasibility (Ex. 553-5). JACA appears to have found a PELof 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ economically infeasible. On the other hand, the workingdraft written by OSHA staff in 1983 and based upon the JACA report andother evidence and analysis, concluded that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ isfeasible, but that for economic reasons a 5-year compliance time wouldhave to be provided (Ex. 570). However, that draft was never publishedand never became Agency policy, because, as OSHA has maintained since 1981,the Agency has had insufficient information upon which to base a feasibilitydetermination regarding secondary copper smelting. To correct that deficiency,OSHA in 1987-88 reopened the record and again initiated a full public rulemakingto collect additional current data. OSHA's present feasibility determination is based largely upon data andinformation provided to the record in the 1987-88 phase of this rulemaking.OSHA has concluded that data and analysis prior to 1984 do not providea reliable source for a current determination concerning feasibility. Sixth, industry misconstrues both the concept of technological feasibilityand the concept of an integrated system of controls. Industry incorrectlyasserts that NIOSH's (and others') statement that such a system of controls,including some reliance upon respirators, is necessary to achieve air leadlevels of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ throughout this industry constitutes a recognitionthat it is infeasible to achieve the PEL by engineering and work practicecontrols alone. In fact, OSHA strongly supports the need for implementinga system of integrated controls to achieve the strict PEL of the lead standardand recognizes, with NIOSH, that at times employees may have to wear respiratorsto control their air lead levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (e.g., in certainmaintenance operations). The court has never said that for a PEL to be found feasible it must becapable of being achieved by engineering and work practice controls allof the time in all operations. Indeed the court has recognized that inthe limited number of operations where it is not feasible to achieve 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ exclusively by implementing work practice and engineeringcontrols, respirators may have to be worn to provide supplemental protectionto workers. Thus, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry arguments. Based upon its own expertise,experience and the record evidence, the Agency concludes that a PEL of50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable by means of engineering and work practicecontrols in the secondary copper smelting industry.<T3>Uses. </T3>The largest use for copper in the United States is for wireand cable. Applications include construction, telecommunications, transportationequipment, and electrical equipment. These products accounted for 82 percentof all copper consumed in the U.S. in 1986. Copper is also fabricated intotubing used in refrigeration systems and automobile radiators. Copper alloysare widely used in the fabrication of plumbing fixtures and decorativeitems [Ex. 573, p. 6]. <T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Secondary copper smelters are classified underSIC code 3341. They differ from primary smelters in that secondary smeltersuse copper-bearing scrap exclusively as their primary raw material. There are currently five secondary copper smelting facilities in operationin the U.S., though Cerro Copper Products Company reportedly uses high-gradescrap and generates much less lead fume than the other four producers [Ex.686c, pp. 1-2]. The workforce exposed to lead is estimated to be 1150 workers,with 10% involved in scrap handling and sampling, 55% involved in smelting,30% involved in anode production, and 5% involved in baghouse work anddust handling [Exs. 573, p 4; 686c, p. 1].With regard to production data,<ITAG tagnum="20">[i]t is not possible to provide data on the total amount of copperproduced by secondary smelters. U.S. government data on the use of scrapcopper combine use data for secondary smelters with those for either brassand bronze ingot makers or primary producers. The picture is further complicatedby the fact that many secondary smelters smelt or refine imported blackor blister copper as well as scrap copper. In some years, the use of importedblack or blister copper may be high enough at some facilities for themto be reclassified as primary refiners. As a result, separate total productiondata are not available for the secondary smelter industry [Ex. 573, pp.12-15].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), which representedfour secondary copper smelters in the remand proceeding, did not submitproduction data for the public record. Since 1980, total domestic consumption of copper has varied between 3.1and 3.8 million short tons while consumption of refined copper has fluctuatedbetween 2.1 and 3.0 million short tons [Ex. 573, p. 7]. Imports of refined copper were presented by Meridian [Ex. 573, p. 8]. Between1980 and 1985, net imports as a percentage of U.S. refined copper consumptionexceeded 14 percent in each year except 1982 (when the percentage fellto 9.7 percent). By 1986 it was estimated to be over 22 percent [Ex. 573,p. 8] but declined to about 18 percent in 1988 [U.S. Industrial Outlook,1989, Department of Commerce]. An important aspect of the secondary copper smelting industry is its dependenceon copper-based scrap as a raw material. Since 1980, the percentage oftotal U.S. consumption of copper derived from scrap has varied between35.5 percent and 43.2 percent [Ex. 573, p. 10]. Competition for scrap frombrass and bronze ingot makers and brass mills is limited because secondarysmelters can smelt and refine lower grades of scrap [Ex. 573, p. 12]. Itshould be noted that the U.S is a net exporter of copper scrap and foreigncompetitors successfully bid for domestic scrap [Ex. 573, p. 12]. Currently, the price of copper has risen to over $1.00 per pound. Historicaldata in current dollars show that the price of refined copper declinedsteadily between 1980 and 1985 from $1.02 per pound to $.69 per pound [Ex.573, p. 16]. At the same time, the price of No. 1 scrap also declined,from $.65 to $.40 per pound. The difference between these two prices hasremained relatively stable, however, fluctuating between about $.26 and$.29. These trends are much the same when examined from the standpointof constant (1982) dollars [Ex. 573, p. 18]. While OSHA would prefer sector or plant specific financial data, such datawere not made available to the Agency by the secondary copper smeltersduring the informal public hearing. Public information was available, however,from Dialog Information Services (Duns Financial Records Plus) and fromthe Securities and Exchange Commission. Sales data from Dialog for Chemetco and Franklin Smelting and Refiningindicated annual sales of about $25 million for each plant in 1988. Salesfor a third producer, Southwire, an integrated wire and cable operation,were about $550 million in 1986, according to SEC filings. No data wereavailable for the largest plant, Nassau Recycling. Data on profitability were also available from Dialog. Average ROS for60 firms with primary activities classified under SIC 3341 was 1.7 percentin 1988. Of the three firms for which sales data were quoted above, onlythe primary activities of Franklin Smelting fall under SIC 3341. Chemetcois classified as a primary copper smelter (SIC 3331). Southwire is alsoa primary metals operation. According to Southwire's SEC filing, net incomein 1986 was approximately 1.1 percent of sales. Dun and Bradstreet datafor 1986 were available for primary metals (SIC 33). The ROS for SIC 33was 4.6 percent in 1986 [Dun and Bradstreet Industry Norms and Key BusinessRatios, 1987].<T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>Compliance costs will be incurred primarilyfor additional exhaust ventilation, isolation and enclosure, and for improvedhousekeeping. Costs as developed in this section, are incremental; theestimates presented were based on the costs necessary to bring a secondarysmelter (Company ``D'') into compliance from the existing level of control.Costs for additional exhaust ventilation equipment were estimated by Meridianand included costs for transfer operations (ventilated ladles), ventilationat slag holes, the slag testing area, the ladle preheating area, and thecast pot staging area [Ex. 686c, pp. 35-36]. Incremental capital costsfor this equipment were estimated to be $525,000 for company ``D'' and$1,275,000 for a larger plant. OSHA assumes the cost of secondary hoodingfor the converter will be $75,000 (5,000 cfm at a unit cost of $15) forcompany ``D'' and $225,000 for a larger facility, which is assumed to havethree convertors. Although industry commented (but did not supply datato support its contention) that the 10 percent factor used to estimateoperation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses underestimated such expenses[Ex. 582-89, p. 26]. OSHA believes that a factor of 10 percent accuratelyreflects annual Oandamp;M costs, and has used this figure in many regulatoryimpact assessments. Total incremental ventilation costs for company ``D''and the larger plant would be $600,000 and $1,500,000, respectively. Totalannual costs would be the sum of annualized capital costs and operationand maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses. Annualized capital costs for the twoplants would be $88,080 and $220,200, respectively, based on a twelve yearuseful life and a 10 percent cost of capital. Oandamp;M expenses for eachplant would be 10 percent of capital costs. Total annual costs for ventilationfor company ``D'' and the larger plant are thus estimated to be $148,080and $370,200, respectively.Costs for cab enclosures, fresh air stations, enclosed booths, and housekeeping,including annual cleaning, were also estimated. Costs for cab enclosureswere estimated to be $5,000 per unit [Ex. 686c, pp. 32-33]. Annualizedcapital costs would be $734 per unit, and annual Oandamp;M expenses wouldbe $3,600, including HEPA filter replacement. Total annual costs for thisequipment are estimated to be $21,670 for company ``D'' and $65,010 forthe larger plant. Costs for filtered air booths and fresh air islands wereestimated to be $15,000 per unit [Ex. 686c, pp. 32-33]. Annualized capitalcosts would be $2,202 per unit, and Oandamp;M expenses would be $1,500 annuallyfor fresh air islands and $1,750 annually for filtered air booths. (HEPAfilter replacement is estimated to cost $250 annually for filtered airbooths). Company ``D'' was estimated to require one filtered air boothand one fresh air island. Larger smelters are estimated to require threeof each item. Total annual costs for this equipment are estimated to be$7,654 for company ``D'' and $22,962 for larger plants.OSHA also estimated the cost of a vacuum system. This cost was estimatedto be $16,667 for company ``D'' and $50,000 for larger plants [Ex. 668E].Annual costs, including annualized capital and Oandamp;M expenses, wouldbe $6,937 and $20,810, respectively. An increase in costs due to additionalhousekeeping is expected. Costs for equipment for outdoor wet sweepingwere estimated to be $35,000 (1 sweeper truck) for company ``D'' and $105,000(3 trucks) for a larger facility [Ex. 686c, p. 32]. Costs for indoor wetsweeping equipment were estimated to be $14,000 (2 floor-scrubber vacuums)for company ``D'' and $42,000 for a larger facility (6 vacuums) [Ex. 686c,p. 32]. Annual costs for sweeping equipment, including annualized capitaland Oandamp;M expenses, would be $12,093 for company ``D'' and $36,280 fora larger facility. Costs were also estimated for additional labor for housekeeping.It was estimated that $8,470 would be incurred by company ``D'' and $25,410would be incurred by a larger facility. (The estimates for additional housekeepingwere based on assuming an increase of two person-hours per day for company``D'' and an increase of six person-hours per day in larger facilities,at an average wage of $12.10 per hour for 7 days per week over 50 weeks).Costs for the annual cleaning were estimated by Meridian to be $65,400for company ``D'' and $196,200 for a larger facility [Ex. 686c, p. 32].Costs for the regular relining of convertors were assumed to be $1,000annually per convertor, including labor and materials. Costs for company``D'' were thus estimated to be $1,000 and costs for larger smelters wereestimated to be $3,000. Costs for relining the roofs of Maerz furnaceswere assumed to be $1,000 annually for company ``D'' and $3,000 annuallyfor a larger plant.OSHA also estimated costs which will be incurred for dust packaging. Evidencein the public record indicated that costs to ventilate a dust packagingsystem in a larger smelter would be $75,000 [Ex. 668E]. Based on this figure,capital costs for company ``D'' were estimated to be $25,000. Total annualcosts for dust packaging for a larger plant and company ``D'' would be$18,510 and $6,170, respectively.Finally, OSHA estimated the costs of isolation and barriers (which mayinclude structural or flexible materials). Company ``D'' was assumed torequire at least $25,000 in capital while a larger facility was assumedto require $75,000. Annualized capital costs, computed at a 10 percentfinancing rate and using a twenty year useful life, will be $2,938 forcompany ``D'' and $8,813 for larger plants. (Since it was anticipated thatthe majority of these costs would be for structural materials as opposedto flexible, a 20 year useful life was used to compute annualized capitalcosts. Using this methodology, costs for barriers will be understated somewhat.)Oandamp;M costs for these barriers were assumed to be negligible.The cost of the industrial hygiene survey was estimated to be $1,000, basedon one hygienist working for two days at $500 per day. The first day wouldbe required for a survey of the site and the second day would be requiredfor actual monitoring and for the evaluation of mechanical equipment. (Thelarger facility may require additional time, and thus, additional initialcosts). Recurring costs were not estimated to be required; thus, no annualcosts were estimated.Costs of improved work practices to limit upsets during furnace chargingare assumed to be insignificant, as it is likely that any costs associatedwith this recommendation would be offset by savings realized in that blockagesof the furnace would no longer need to be cleared.Total annual incremental costs for company ``D'' were thus estimated tobe $278,588. Total annual costs for the larger facility are expected tobe $759,724. The total annual industry cost is estimated to be $1.9 million,based on the existence of 5 smelters, four of which are approximately thesize of company ``D'' and one of which is larger. A comment was received regarding costs of compliance for a larger smelter[Ex. 582-89, pp. 27-28]. It was asserted that this facility has implemented80,000 cfm in exhaust ventilation at one of its furnaces though, apparently,none at any of the other three. No justification was given as to why thisair volume was chosen, nor was any description offered of any other controlmeasures currently being practiced. While this submission indicated thata large smelter may be larger than reflected in the methodology used tocomplete this analysis, the submission also indicated a higher level ofbaseline control currently in place than OSHA's methodology assumed. (Onlycontrols for agglomerators, blast furnaces, and one travelling hood wererequired in the industry submission). As noted above, the incremental cost estimates were developed based largelyupon information obtained pertaining to company ``D.'' Reliable, detailedinformation for other plants was not made available to the Agency.<T3>Economic Feasibility.</T3> No sales or value of shipments data weresupplied by the industry during public comment periods or during the publichearing; sales for the secondary copper smelting industry were estimatedusing two approaches. Meridian estimated sales based on average revenueproduct per production worker for SIC 3341 [Exs. 573, 686c]. Total industrysales were estimated to be $390,590,550. In a second approach, the refined copper product of the industry was estimatedto be 295,650,000 pounds [Ex. 573, p. 13; Ex. 574, p. 6]. This volume ofproduct, at $1.00 per pound, represents $295,650,000 in shipments for thesecondary copper smelters. Price increases required to pass forward the costs of compliance can beestimated by comparing total annual costs to total sales. With total annualcosts of $1.9 million and total copper sales of $295,650,000, a price increaseof about 0.6 percent is indicated. The average price of refined copperincreased by over 30 percent between 1987 and 1988, and demand for refinedcopper is near historical highs [Department of Commerce, U.S. IndustrialOutlook, 1989]. Over the same period, scrap prices have also risen sharply(over 30 percent). Although the required price increase represents a smallportion of the recent variability in the price of copper, price increasesare not likely for this sector, since the price of copper is a world price.OSHA calculated profitability impacts based on Dun and Bradstreet statistics.Using the sales and ROS figures presented above, OSHA developed estimatesof profits derived solely from the secondary smelting of copper. To estimateprofit impact, the tax-deductibility of compliance costs was taken intoaccount. That is, care was taken to compute before-tax profit before subtractingannual costs. After subtracting annual costs, the appropriate average taxrate was then reapplied to determine after-tax profit net of costs. Forthis sector, an average tax rate of 0.34 was used. Using the total industrysales estimate of $295,650,000 and the ROS rate of 1.7 percent for SIC3341 yields a total profit estimate of about $5 million. Since total annualincremental costs for the sector were estimated to be $1.9 million, thecost to profit ratio would be 0.25. The associated post-compliance ROSwas estimated to be 1.3 percent. Since plant specific sales data were available from the Dialog databaseand SEC filings, impacts on total profits were also calculated for threefirms. Total sales for Franklin Smelting were reported to be $25 millionin 1988. Applying the ROS factor for SIC 3341 of 1.7 percent, total profitsfor this firm were calculated to be $425,000. Total profits for Southwirewere $6.1 million in 1986 with an associated ROS rate of 1.1 percent, accordingto the company's SEC filings. Assuming that Chemetco's activities are 50percent primary smelting and 50 percent secondary smelting, ROS was estimatedto be 3.2 percent (the average of the 1.7 percent rate for SIC 3341 andthe 4.6 percent rate for SIC 33). Applied against the sales figure of $25million for this firm yields a profit estimate of $800,000. Cost to profit ratios were then computed for these three smelters. Thecost to profit ratio for Franklin Smelting was calculated to be 0.43 (withan associated post-compliance ROS of 1.0 percent), while the ratios forSouthwire and Chemetco were calculated to be 0.030 (with an associatedpost-compliance ROS of 1.1 percent) and 0.23 (with an associated post-complianceROS of 2.5 percent), respectively. According to its SEC filings, Southwireis a major producer of wire and cable for construction and utilities andthe company believss it is in a strong competitive position with regardto both markets. The corporation has also entered into a joint venturewith the Furukawa Electric Company Ltd., of Japan and the partnership isthe exclusive licensee in the U.S. of a high value-added, water imperviousunderground cable. Evidence suggests that impacts for Cerro Copper willbe minor, as they reportedly generate less lead fume than the other plants.No information was available which would permit OSHA to compute profitimpacts for Nassau Recycling. OSHA recognizes that rates of return are modest for this sector Also, whilethe industry is currently enjoying strong demand, this sector has beencontracting for some time; there were twenty secondary smelters operatingin 1965 but only five remain in operation today. Factors contributing tothis decline are expanding world copper refining capacity and governmentsubsidization of copper production among foreign competitors [<T3>Copper,</T3> Mineral Facts and Problems, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Departmentof Interior, 1985]. (Private U.S. refiners bear the brunt of cutbacks duringcyclic downturns in copper demand while foreign nationalized smelters benefitfrom government subsidies.) Additionally, some primary smelters are currentlyrefining copper by the electrowinning process, a process for which capitalcosts are roughly one-half those of conventional smelting. This technologyis expected to represent about 18 percent of domestic copper refining in5 years, and less efficient secondary smelters may be put at a competitivedisadvantage. Nevertheless, the profit impact ratios computed above indicate that, withadditional compliance time, the costs of compliance can be absorbed. Additionaltime is granted because of the inability of firms in this sector to raiseprices and because rates of return are low. The extended schedule willprovide opportunities to increase production efficiency, thereby cuttingcosts and improving profitability, and to phase in engineering controls.Thus, OSHA concludes that the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL is economically feasiblewith an extended compliance period of five years. The impact of this regulationwill not threaten industry existence or structure.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair  </ITAG><T3>Process Description and Sources of Exposure_Overview. </T3>For purposesof this rulemaking, the shipbuilding and repair industry can be dividedinto two segments: (1) nuclear shipbuilding and repair, and (2) non-nuclearshipbuilding and repair. Nuclear yards, in addition to sharing the verylimited exposure problems of non-nuclear yards, have other lead exposureproblems that are peculiarly related to work on nuclear ships. Consequently,these segments have fundamentally different problems with regard to leadexposure. For non-nuclear yards, employees can be exposed to lead primarily in paintingand paint removal operations. As lead-free paint is being increasinglysubstituted for leaded paint, lead exposure in paint application is diminishing,and exposure problems are basically limited to operations involving removalof old leaded paint. This means that for 398 non-nuclear yards of the approximately400 total shipyards (nuclear and non-nuclear combined), employing morethan 60% of the total industry workers, increasingly the only employeesexposed to lead are in the paint removal operation. Even for that smallnumber of employees, lead exposure is being further reduced as the useof lead-free paint becomes more widespread and the subsequent removal ofpaint and repainting involves only lead-free paint. Thus, the single operationin non-nuclear yards in which lead exposures may continue for some timeis becoming an operation that does not use lead. When full substitutionof lead-free paint takes place, employees in these non-nuclear yards aswell as those in nuclear yards performing painting and paint removal willno longer be subjected to lead exposure (Ex. 610, p. 19). At the two nuclear yards in the industry, Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS)and General Dynamics Electric Boat Division (GD), lead-free paint is nowgenerally or exclusively used (Ex. 582-66, p. 6). Consequently, the sourcesof lead exposure are essentially limited to the removal of old leaded paintand to certain operations peculiar to the construction and repair of nuclearships. These operations relate to installing or removing lead ballast andto building and installing lead shielding panels for nuclear reactors.In both nuclear and non-nuclear yards, shipbuilding and ship repair workis labor intensive. Many operations are performed manually to meet customerspecifications (Ex. 582-66, pp. 1, 5). As ship construction proceeds andmore structures are erected and joined, the work environment changes andcan become more confined. Where there are lead exposures in enclosed, narrowspaces, engineering control equipment can be difficult to apply (Ex. 582-66,p. 1). Consequently, employees working in such spaces may be potentiallyexposed to high lead exposures. <T3>General Ship Construction. </T3>Many of the main production processesin ship building are common to both nuclear and non nuclear yards. In bothtypes of yards, to form the ship's hull, steel plates are first treatedby automatic shotblasting machines. The steel plates are then coated byautomatic spraying in booths or by airless spray guns with a primer paintto reduce corrosion. Then smaller plates are cut by an oxy-fuel torch orguillotine; larger or duplicate pieces are cut on automatic machines. Thesteel pieces are shaped by bending, rolling, or pressing; welded into subassemblies;and fitted together. Once the hull has been assembled, the ship is launched.Its interior (pipes, wiring, controls, equipment, rigging, etc.) are theninstalled at a fitting-out berth. Finally the ship is ready to undergosea trials to determine whether mechanical or physical defects exist. Adjustmentsmay involve the removal of components, stripping of insulation, welding,repainting, and cleaning of oil tanks and lines prior to repair (Ex. 572).<T3>General Ship Repair. </T3>Many shipyards of both sorts combine repair,overhaul, and conversion with shipbuilding capabilities. Unscheduled oremergency repair and casualty work are relatively rare. Scheduled repairsoften are in the nature of maintenance and involve cleaning and repaintingthe ship's hull at the time the ship is inspected. Major overhauls andconversions include changing the ship's capacity and size (e.g., placinga new and larger midships section between the bow and stern) and changingthe ship's cargo-carrying characteristics or its propulsion system. Shiprepair yards also engage in non-ship industrial work (e.g., repairs onoil platforms, foundry operations, carpentry work) (Ex. 572, p. 3). Paint removal is often necessary in many types of repair work. It alsocan be an important step in cleaning the ship's surface prior to otheroperations such as welding. Traditionally, abrasive blasting has been usedto remove old, deteriorating paint and to create small indentations oretchings on the ship's surface to facilitate the bonding of new paint.Other methods of paint removal are available, such as grinding, sanding,needle gunning, and chemical cleaning (Ex. 582-66, p. 10). In some repairoperations, welding, cutting, and burning is done directly through theexisting layer of paint. If that paint contains lead, these operationsresult in lead emissions (Ex. 572, p. 3). As indicated above, substitutesfor leaded paints are available and widely used. Thus, exposures to leadin paint removal operations have already been or, in time, will be eliminatedin ship yards as lead-free paint is substituted for the leaded paint onold ships (Exs. 582-66, p. 6; 610, pp. 19, 20). <T3>Nuclear Ship Construction and Repair. </T3>Nuclear ship constructionand repair involve special activities related to installing and removinglead ballast in nuclear submarines and other ships and to constructingand installing lead shielding for nuclear reactors (Ex. 582-66, p. 12).Exposures to lead primarily are limited to these operations which includecasting lead panels; tinning, bonding or burning on leaded structures;caulking with leaded wool; sawing, passing, and packing lead ballast; weldingon or near leaded surfaces; and carbon arc gouging of canning plates duringoverhaul (Ex. 582-66, pp. 12-23). These processes are described in detailbelow. In fitting vessels with nuclear reactors, the entire interior of the reactorcompartment, as well as the interior of the hull, must be lined with leadto effectively shield personnel from radiation (Ex. 610, p. 24). Elementallead slabs are cast and built into the primary shield tank enclosing thenuclear reactor, and secondary lead shielding is built into the bulkheadssurrounding the reactor compartment. Operations involving casting of primaryand secondary lead shielding are performed in fixed facilities off ship,but the reactor shield subassemblies are assembled in final form in thevessel itself (Ex. 610, p. 25). <T3>Casting. </T3>Lead is melted, poured and cast to form reactor shieldingpanels. (A description of foundry operations and their controls is discussedat length in the section of this preamble devoted to nonferrous foundries.)NNS, the largest nuclear shipyard in the United States, pours and castslead shielding panels in a semi-automated process in a newly constructedlead shielding panel shop. In this process, elemental lead is melted andpumped into an open trough that delivers the molten lead to the castingmachine to cast into shapes. After casting, the lead shielding panels aresized to exact dimensions on a computer-controlled milling machine in thepanel shop (Ex. 582-66, pp. 12-13). <T3>Burning. </T3>Tinning and bonding are collectively referred to as leadburning. Exposure to lead occurs when the heat of the burning torch causesthe lead, lead dust or tinning paste (a lead-tin alloy) to fume off andbecome airborne (Exs. 572, p 2; 688B, pp. 1-9). a. Tinning: Shielding panels are sized by a process of milling, chipping,grinding, and planing. Then, they are mounted onto steel frames onboardship by tinning and bonding. Tinning is the application of a thin coatof lead-tin alloy paste to the cleaned and heated surface of the steelplate. The surface is then conditioned by heating with an oxygen-hydrogentorch to provide a thin lead film on the steel to which the lead panelis bonded. Not only does the thin lead film facilitate the bonding of thelead shield panels to steel, it also ensures the structural integrity ofthe bond under shock testing (Exs. 572, p. 2; 610, p. 25; 688B, pp. 1-4).b. Bonding: The actual bonding is accomplished by depositing lead in thejoint or seam between the tinned steel plates and lead panels. The bondingprocess is essential in that the effected adhesion of lead to steel mustbe able to prevent leakage of radiation and also withstand the shock thatthe shield may be exposed to during the operational lifetime of the vessel(Exs. 610, p. 25; 688B, p. 5). There are two methods of bonding. In manual ladle bonding, as the nameimplies, molten lead (at 700 to 850 anddegrees;F) is ladled by hand froma lead pot into the joint (Exs. 572, p. 2; 688B, p. 5). This process requiresa specially trained team with one or two operators using oxygen-hydrogentorches in the joint and another operator ladling lead into the joint (Exs.572, p. 2; 688B, p 5). By contrast, manual torch bonding involves manuallymelting lead bars with an oxy-propane torch onto lead panels to ``buildup'' or increase the thickness of the panels to specifications (Exs. 582-66,pp. 13-14; 688B, pp. 5-6). Manual torch bonding is used in lieu of manualladling where limited accessibility to the joints precludes the use ofa lead pot and ladle. This is most often the case onboard ship (Exs. 582-66,p. 16; 688B, pp. 5-6).<T3>Caulking.</T3> Caulking may be used in some cases instead of burning.It substitutes for tinning and bonding and involves manually forcing leadwool, lead rope, or lead strips into the joint around the shielding panel,using a pneumatic blunt-ended chisel. Caulking, because it is ``cold''lead work, produces much lower levels of exposures to lead than lead burning.According to James Thorton, manager of Industrial Hygiene at NNS, eithercaulking or burning can be used to fill the lead joints around shieldingpanels. On submarines, however, because of Navy specifications, very littlecaulking is allowed and joints generally are burned in (Ex. 582-66, pp.18, 19). <T3>Lead Ballast Work_Sawing, Passing, and Packing.</T3> Navy specificationsrequire that lead ballast be installed in the hulls of submarines (Exs.582-66, p. 22; 688B, p. 10). The ballast is used to trim the submarineso that it floats in a level manner and to add weight to the submarinefor more stability in rough weather. Because of the density of lead, leadbricks are used as permanent ballast on submarines. The submarine hull frame is divided into compartments and bins. Lead blocksare cut offship with a bandsaw to form bricks and shims of various sizesand shapes for ballast. Then passers move the bricks and shims from thesaw shop to the vessel, where they are tightly packed into the ballastbins. Lead ballast packers are responsible for installing lead in the ballastbins. The process involves hammering, fitting, and shimming the lead asrequired to fill the voids between the lead ballast and the hull. All ballast operations are performed cold; no melting of lead is required.Exposure to airborne lead occurs from dispersion of surface lead oxideduring handling and from lead dust during sawing (Exs. 572, p. 3; 582-66,pp. 20-23; 610, pp. 21-24). Sawing lead ballast may result in high exposuresif the saws are not enclosed and ventilated. <T3>Canninq and Welding.</T3> After installation of lead ballast, steelcanning plates are fitted and welded over the lead in the bins to securethe ballast in place. As in lead ballast work, when all shielding panelshave been installed over the frame, steel canning plates and retainer barsalso are welded over the lead panels to protect the shielding and maintainit in place. Welding of these structures may result in lead emissions,because the heat generated may be sufficient to volatilize the lead fromtinned surfaces or the lead ballast or caulking adhering to the canningplates and nearby frames (Exs. 582-66, pp. 21-23; 610, pp. 21-24; 688B,pp. 11-16). <T3>Overhaul and Carbon Arc Gouging.</T3> During overhaul, the lead inthe ballast bins must be removed. The canning plate is removed by carbon-arcgouging to allow for inspection, and the ballast bricks are removed fromthe bins to a storage area in the drydock. For reinstallation, the leadbricks are transported to and packed into the bins, and the canning plateis replaced (Ex. 582-66, p. 21). The removal of canning plates by carbon arc gouging may provide a significantsource of lead exposure. This process involves passing a high electricalcurrent through a copper-coated carbon rod and striking an arc on the steelsurface. If the arc breaks through the canning plate to the lead below,the intense heat needed to melt the weld joint causes the lead to volatilizeand fume. When the metal weld surface becomes molten steel, it is removedfrom the gouge path by controlled release of compressed air. This highpressure air stream also increases the dispersion of lead as well as scattersother molten metals (Exs. 610, pp. 23, 24; 688B, pp. 11-16). A few other miscellaneous operations produce insignificant airborne levelsof lead, such as the use of lead blankets as temporary shielding, the useof coated lead bricks, the sorting of scrap lead and quality control inspectionof lead structures (Ex. 582-66, p. 23). In summary, across the shipbuildingindustry exposures to lead occur to a limited and decreasing degree inthe application and removal of leaded paint. In addition, in the nuclearsegment of the industry exposures also occur in operations relating tofitting the vessel with lead shielding for the nuclear reactor and to fabricating,installing and removing lead ballast. <T3>Existing Exposure Levels and Current Controls_Overview.</T3> Workersexposed to lead in shipbuilding can be divided into two general categories:(1) non-nuclear construction and repair, and (2) nuclear construction andrepair. In <T3>non-nuclear construction</T3>, exposure data in the record indicatethat average lead exposures generally have been reduced to or below 50andCx.18;g/m\3\ or exposure to lead has been entirely eliminated. In <T3>non-nuclear repair</T3>, only a small percentage of employees, primarilyin the paint removal operation, are exposed above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The <T3>nuclear construction and repair</T3> segment of the industry is limitedto two yards. At the larger of the two, NNS, either the majority of airlead monitoring results or average exposure levels are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\in 16 of 26 (62%) lead operations, according to the most recent exposuredata in the record (Ex. 582-66, Table II). These 16 operations employedover 85% of NNS' lead-exposed workers, according to the most recent employmentdata in the record (Ex. 582-66, Table I). GD, by indicating that seriouslead exposure problems are limited to three general problem areas (Ex.688B, p. 1), confirms OSHA's understanding that most operations and thevast majority of employees in nuclear yards have average exposures at orbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In nuclear and non-nuclear shipbuilding and repair, the primary engineeringcontrol used to reduce worker exposure levels is local exhaust ventilation.Operations that generally are exhausted include welding, casting, burning,caulking, carbon arc gouging, and sawing. Substitution of lead-free paintsfor leaded paints is another control measure that has eliminated lead exposuresduring painting and significantly contributed to reduction in exposurein paint removal. In nuclear shipbuilding, moving preassembly to fixedlocations offship is a process modification which has reduced the problemof high exposures caused by assembling on board ship (Ex. 582-66, p. 13).<T3>Non-nuclear construction and repair.</T3> Non-nuclear constructionand repair yards employ 66,750 (63.7%) of the estimated 104,750 shipbuildingindustry employees (Ex. 686B, pp. 2-3). In 1982, JACA reported that innon-nuclear construction and repair, average exposures above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\were limited to three operations: painting (100 andCx.18;g/m\3\), paint removal(280 andCx.18;g/m\3\), and welding/burning (110 andCx.18;g/m\3\) (Ex. 553-8,pp. 1-2 to 1-5). OSHA believes that since then, the increasingly widespreaduse of lead-free paints (Ex. 610, pp. 19 and 20) and the implementationof airless paint guns have greatly reduced or virtually eliminated leadexposure in painting in the non-nuclear sector. Consequently, OSHA finds that in non-nuclear shipyards lead exposure above50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is primarily limited to paint removal operations. Nonetheless,even where removal of paint is by means of blasting, more than 70% of monitoringresults in 1984 and subsequent years are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, accordingto OSHA inspection data (Ex. 572, p. 15). As lead-free paints completelyreplace leaded paints, OSHA expects exposures above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ tobe virtually eliminated in non-nuclear paint removal. OSHA notes that today the number of employees doing paint removal in thenon-nuclear sector is a small part of the 66,750 employees working in thatsector. Although industry has not provided OSHA with current employmentdata for the non-nuclear ship sector, if the 3.6% figure for the percentof employees at NNS who were doing paint removal in 1981 (Ex. 553-8, pp.1-2 to 1-5) is typical of current employment in non-nuclear shipyards,then approximately 2,400 employees presently remove paint in this sector.<T3>Nuclear construction and repair. </T3>Nuclear ship construction andrepair is carried out in two yards employing an estimated 38,000 workers,which is 36.3% of total industry employment (Ex. 686B, pp. 2, 3). NNS employs27,000 workers and GD approximately 11,000 (Exs. 582-66, p. 2; 686B, pp.2, 3). GD currently has an estimated 650 workers designated as lead workers, lessthan 6% of its workforce. NNS, in 1981 when its employment was higher,had 1,357 workers designated as lead workers, which would be approximately5% of its current workforce (Ex. 582-66, Table I). Thus, GD and NNS combinedappear to have approximately 2,000 lead workers, which is less than 2%of total industry employment (Ex. 686B, pp. 2-3). Since raw data were not provided by the nuclear segment of this industry,OSHA relied on the average values and the distribution of samples belowand above 50 stated in submissions by NNS and GD (Exs. 582-66; 688B). Thedata show that reduction in employee exposure levels has resulted fromthe implementation of improved engineering and work practice controls. For most lead operations and most employees exposed to lead, exposure levelsreflected in the most recent exposure data (1985-86) are close to or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of the time at NNS (Ex. 582-66, Table II). With regardto operations, in 16 of 26 operations at NNS, a majority of exposure readingsor average exposure levels are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In seven of these,NNS recently engineered out lead exposure by substituting lead-free paints,painting ballast bricks, using prefabricated lead wool blankets for temporaryreactor shielding, or eliminating the operation. In another of these 16operations, referred to as ``miscellaneous'' operations, exposure levelswere below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ even in 1981, and employees continue to beexposed below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, according to NNS's prehearing comment (Ex.582-66, p. 24). In addition to these 16 operations, in three other operations,42-49% of the samples also are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-66, TableII). Thus, utilizing NNS' 1981 employment data, the only employment data providedby NNS, the number of employees in the operations where monitoring resultsare at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for most, or close to most of the timerepresents over 90% of all lead-exposed workers at NNS' (Ex. 582-66, TablesI and II). Conversely, less than 10% of NNS lead exposed workers are likelyto have lead exposures consistently above 50. Furthermore, some of theworkers who constitute this 10% work in an operation where average exposurelevels are only 66 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-66, Table 11). This degree of control reflects a significant reduction in lead use andexposure and a substantial improvement in engineering and work practicecontrols achieved since the lead standard went into effect in 1979. Forexample, between 1981 and 1985 NNS achieved a 28% reduction in the numberof operations using lead and achieved a significant reduction in exposurelevels in every operation but one. Assuming that the number of employeesworking in each operation at NNS was the same in 1985 as in 1981, therewas during that period a 27% reduction in the number of employees exposedabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-66, Tables I and II). Major reductions in employee air lead levels also have been achieved inthat same period by GD through improved engineering and work practice controls(Ex. 688B). For example, in one operation identified by GD as having highemployee exposure, lead boot, a tripling of the exhausted air volume, inconjunction with improvements in dust collectors and hooding, resultedin the 1979-87 period in a radical reduction of employee exposure levelsfrom an average of 3,180 andCx.18;g/m\3\ to 72 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 688B, p.8). In lead bonding-tinning, the installation of slotted hoods, combined withimproved work practices, reduced exposure levels so that 50% of monitoringresults are now below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Similarly, the installation ofthe so-called TB-8F-SH modern exhaust system, combined with improved workpractices, reduced exposure levels in another bonding-tinning operationso that 42% of monitoring results are now below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex 688B,p. 3). GD has identified only three general areas of high lead exposure. Theseinclude construction and installation of the reactor shield, ballast installationand removal, and abrasive blasting (Ex. 688B, p. 1). Based upon NNS' data,these also appear to be among the main problem areas there as well.  Nevertheless, even in operations that are characterized by relatively highaverage lead exposures, like lead bonding, lead shielding, ballast work,carbon arc gouging, and blasting, exposure levels at NNS are less than100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ more than 70% of the time. For example, in welding andburning of leaded surfaces, which includes carbon arc gouging, an operationthat NNS has asserted it cannot control to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, 33% of exposuresamples are below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 66% are less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In lead bonding done aboard ship, 75% of exposures are less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In casting of shielding panels, 72% of exposures are less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In the several operations involving installing and removing lead ballast,72-100% of exposures are less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Finally, in blastingand in painting/rust grinding, exposure levels are less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\62 and 68% of the time, respectively (Ex. 582-66, Table II). (Unfortunately,because GD did not provide OSHA with raw data or with data indicating thenumber or percentage of exposure monitoring results below 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\,the Agency cannot provide a similar analysis of GD's data.) The primary engineering control used in shipbuilding to reduce worker exposurelevels is local exhaust ventilation (Ex. 582-66, p. 4). Welding, burning,and caulking operations are reported to be locally exhausted whenever possible,coupled with the use of respirators. Substitution of non-leaded paintshas eliminated lead exposures during the process of paint application andhas contributed to reductions in exposure levels in some paint removaloperations. Controls for abrasive blasting include type CE respiratorsin exterior areas, and type CE respirators in conjunction with exhaustventilation in enclosed and confined areas. Lead work controls for mechanicalcleaning of lead coated surfaces (grinding rust) include respirators outdoorsand respirators with exhaust ventilation in enclosed areas (Ex. 582-66,pp. 6-20).<T3>Additional Controls_Overview.</T3> OSHA's analysis of the record inthe previous section indicates that for most operations in both nuclearand non-nuclear shipyards exposure levels already are at or below 50 mg/m\3\.OSHA has reached this conclusion because for most of the operations a majorityof sampling results are at or below 50 mg/m\3\. Based upon that recordand OSHA's own experience and expertise, the Agency has concluded thatfor such operations exposure levels can be controlled consistently to orbelow 50 mg/m\3\ with a modest modification or addition of controls, suchas improving work practices, housekeeping and maintenance. The operationsalready at or below 50 mg/m\3\ most of the time include painting, chippingand grinding, casting, ship fitting, caulking, milling reactor shieldingpanels, passing ballast, and welding. Exposure to lead in paint removalin nuclear and non-nuclear shipyards is also expected to be eliminatedwith the full substitution of lead-free paints on new and old ships (Exs.582-66; 688B).Controlling exposures to or below 50 mg/m\3\ in problem operations willrequire implementation of an integrated system of controls. The basic elementof that system is an industrial hygiene study, which is required by thelead standard to be carried out as part of the development and implementationof a written compliance program (29 CFR 1910.1025(e)(3)). The system alsoshould include training in appropriate work practices, maximizing onshoreoperations (e.g., prefabrication and subassembly), better housekeepingand preventive maintenance, improved ventilation, and, under limited circumstances,the use of respirators.Industry has emphasized the importance of work practices in controllinglead exposures, as evidenced, for example, by the special training givento ``lead workers'' (Exs. 688B; 582-66). Improved work practices can bereadily implemented at low cost and are effective in reducing employees'exposures. For example, employees need to be trained in proper placementof portable local exhaust to maximize its efficiency. Good housekeepingand preventive maintenance measures are crucial to maintaining ventilationsystems in proper working order.An effective way to control lead exposures is to minimize the number ofoperations that are carried out onboard vessels. Generally speaking, operationsperformed onboard often are performed in confined spaces and are thereforemore difficult to control. Where operations are performed in fixed locationson shore, these facilities can be more effectively equipped with ventilationsystems. For those major shipyards that have not yet done so, sawing, grinding,chipping, machining, and hot work can be moved to onshore assembly shops,which can be equipped with large, effective ventilation systems.<T3>Paint Removal. </T3>Paint removal can be accomplished by several methods:grinding, sanding, needle gunning, chemical cleaning and abrasive blasting.The kind of paint removal that causes the highest lead exposures is abrasiveblasting. Technologies are available to control lead exposures in paintremoval to or below 50 mg/m\3\. Local exhaust systems are available toexhaust grinding and sanding operations. Needle gunning, which involvesuse of water under high pressure, produces larger particles of lead andtherefore poses less of an airborne problem (Ex. 582-66, pp. 10-11).In abrasive blasting, two technologies are available to effectively controlexposure levels. One is a portable vacuum system known as ``Blast 'n' Vac.''With Blast 'n' Vac, the vacuum system surrounds the blasting nozzle andexhausts the grit and paint as they are deflected from the painted surface.Grit and paint are deposited in a material recovery container, and dustis removed in a water bath dust filter. According to the manufacturer,Blast 'n' Vac has been used successfully in work on submarines. This systemhas the capability of bringing abrasive blasting workers' 8-hour TWA leadexposures to levels below 50 mg/m\3\ (Exs. 610, pp. 20-21; 572, p. 62).The other technology is hydroblast, which involves a water spray curtainthat surrounds the blast nozzle. The spray wets the grit and paint as theyrebound from the surface and turns them into a slurry. Flash rust of thesurface may be prevented by the addition of a water soluble antioxidantto the water or by quick drying by hot air blast. If the surface has beenoxidized by the use of water, quick abrasive blasting may be performedafter the lead has been removed to take off the oxidation (Ex. 572, p.62; 610, pp. 20-21).Another method to remove paint is by means of chemicals, which effectivelyeliminate lead exposures. If a blast pattern is necessary, the paint maystill be removed with a chemical stripper, and after the removal, the surfacethen can be blasted to apply the etched pattern. As indicated, the useof these techniques, either singly or in combination, will bring exposurelevels under 50 mg/m\3\ and still leave the surface properly conditionedfor painting (Exs. 582-66, pp. 11-12; 610, p. 19).<T3>Lead Ballast. </T3>In lead ballast work, exposures to lead occur fromtwo sources: the release of surface lead oxide, which causes exposuresduring the passing and packing/unpacking of lead ballast; and the releaseof metallic lead particles during sawing of the ballast bricks and shimsto fit into the bins. Exposures due to surface lead oxidation can be reducedto or below 50 mg/m\3\ by epoxy coating or painting the pigs (Ex. 610,p. 22). Exposures due to sawing the ballast can be reduced to or below50 mg/m\3\ by completely enclosing the bandsaw in a booth (Ex. 610, p.22). (NNS currently has an average exposure of 66 mg/m\3\ in this operationwithout enclosures) (Tr. 428). Alternatively, exposures can be eliminatedby purchasing prefabricated ballast shims of various sizes and shapes (Ex.610, p. 22).In addition, a HEPA vacuum can be used to maintain all surfaces as cleanas practicable in the work area, especially after sawing, which would furtherreduce exposure levels and help to minimize the potential for dispersionof lead dust (Ex. 610, p. 23).These control technologies are readily available and are already appliedin other industries as well as in some shipyards.<T3>Casting.</T3> NNS reports an average exposure level of 80 andCx.18;g/m\3\for casting even with the construction of a new lead shielding shop equippedwith new ventilation systems (Ex. 582-66, Table II). Casting at NNS isperformed automatically in the shop (Ex. 582-16, p. 13). OSHA has determinedthat exposures in casting can be reduced to below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ withminor modifications to existing equipment and practices. For example, reductionin exposure levels can be achieved by eliminating the open trough or chutethat delivers the molten lead to the casting machine and replacing it withdirect connection to the lead pump placed in the melting pot. This modification,coupled with better housekeeping and proper maintenance and improved workpractices, should be able to control exposures to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.<T3>Tinning and Bonding (Burning).</T3> NNS states that some tinning andbonding (average exposure result of 312 andCx.18;g/m\3\) is routinely performedin the submarine shop. Under such circumstances, this operation can andshould be effectively controlled with appropriate exhaust ventilation.Another effective way to sharply reduce exposure levels would be to replacethe hot processes of tinning and bonding with caulking, which is a coldoperation performed at room temperature (Ex. 582-66, pp 18-19). Eithercaulking or tinning and bonding can be used to fill the lead joints aroundshielding panels (Ex. 582-66, p. 18). Where caulking has been used, NNSreports that average employee exposure levels are 36 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex.582-6, p 18).Although the Navy apparently allows caulking to be used for most of itsnuclear fleet, OSHA recognizes that the United States Navy in its contractscurrently may allow very little caulking on submarines (Ex. 582-66, p.19). If, with the implementation of the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL, the Navybecomes willing to allow greater use of caulking in submarines, then, whereverpossible, caulking should be substituted for burning. In any event, wheretinning and bonding remain necessary, GD has emphasized the importanceof proper work practices, which can minimize excessive exposures in theapplication of tinning paste and in subsequent work on tinned surfaces(e.g. welding) (Ex. 688b, p. 2). <T3>Carbon Arc Gouging.</T3> OSHA recognizes that carbon arc gouging isan operation in which it is difficult to consistently control exposuresto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. GD has acknowledged that, in conjunctionwith the use of local exhaust ventilation, the key to controlling exposuresin this operation is through consistently good work practices (Ex. 688B,p. 13). This operation can be controlled if the worker can maintain a preciseadjustment of the arc height so as not to penetrate the steel and volatilizethe lead below. Then, the final cut of the weld can be performed with agrinding wheel and local exhaust ventilation (Ex. 688B, p. 13). This workpractice is vital because, on occasions when breakthrough of the arc tothe lead occurs, local exhaust ventilation is unlikely to be adequate toachieve the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ due to the high velocity ejection of the moltenmetal. Because of the complexities of carbon arc gouging and the uncertaintyof alternatives, OSHA believes it may be necessary for workers doing carbonarc gouging to wear respirators for supplementary protection. If carbon arc gouging is performed only intermittently during overhauland if the employee who performs gouging is not exposed to lead in excessof 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for more than 30 days a year, then the employer wouldnot be required under the lead standard to implement engineering and workpractice controls in preference to respirators to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.In cases where exposures are above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for more than 30 daysa year, OSHA suggests that, to the extent practicable, bolting and rivettingbe used as an alternative to welding the canning plates (Ex. 610, p. 24).This would eliminate the need for future removal of plates by gouging.<T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusion. </T3>Based upon the above analysisof the evidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, theAgency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementingreadily available engineering and work practice controls is technologicallyfeasible for the shipbuilding and repair industry as a whole. Nevertheless, the Agency recognizes that it may not be possible to consistentlyachieve the PEL by these controls in certain confined spaces when taskslike carbon arc gouging and tinning and bonding are being performed. SinceOSHA has found the 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ PEL feasible for the industry, employerswill be required in such circumstances, as well, to implement engineeringand work practice controls to control exposure levels to the PEL or thelowest feasible level. Where all feasible engineering and work practicecontrols have been implemented and employees are still exposed above thePEL as an 8-hour TWA, employers will be allowed to provide these workerswith respirators for supplemental protection while they are performingsuch tasks. Through its previous analysis of the record, OSHA has demonstrated thatin both nuclear and non-nuclear shipyards, lead exposure levels for mostoperations already are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In many of the operationswhere exposure levels exceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, improved, modified or additionalengineering and work practice controls can reduce exposures to or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. As indicated, this conclusion is based in part upon thefact that for nearly all of the operations in non-nuclear shipbuildingand repair, available exposure data indicate that average exposure levelsare at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. It is based as well in part upon thefact that for most of the operations in nuclear shipbuilding and repaireither average exposures levels are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ or a majorityof sampling results are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. OSHA's conclusionis further predicated upon its determination that for such operations inboth segments of the industry exposure levels can be controlled consistentlyto or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by maintaining existing controls or by meansof modest additions or improvements to controls. For the few problem operations, OSHA has determined that implementationof an integrated system of controls can substantially reduce exposure levels.These isolated problem operations are confined exclusively to the nuclearsegment of the industry. (OSHA does not consider painting or paint removalin either the non-nuclear or nuclear segments of the industry to be a problemoperation because of the availability and increasing use of lead-free paintsand the availability of controls for, and alternatives to abrasive blastingduring the period that leaded paint still needs to be removed.) As indicatedby the discussion in the exposure levels section, exposure levels in mostof the problem operations are already less than 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ morethan 65% of the time. OSHA therefore concludes that, although these arethe most difficult operations to control to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\,control of these operations should not constitute an insurmountable obstacle.OSHA wishes to emphasize that, in the nuclear segment of the industry,the very substantial reductions in exposure levels accomplished by existingcontrols have been achieved without any legal obligation on the part ofemployers to comply with 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and workpractice controls. OSHA believes that, once the legal obligation to complywith 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ comes into effect, further reductions will take place.OSHA also wishes to point out that the current level of control has beenachieved by technology that is readily available and by conventional workpractices. The further reductions that OSHA foresees also can be achievedby such controls. As GD has noted, the key to controlling excessive exposurelevels often is likely to be appropriate work practices rather than theaddition of complex and costly engineering controls (Ex. 688B, p. 4). Thisis especially true of operations conducted in confined spaces, where theuse of engineering controls may sometimes be difficult. In at least two cases of which OSHA is aware in the nuclear segment ofthe industry, control of excessive exposures in one company can be achievedby merely adopting simple techniques or practices used by the other company,like coating lead ballast materials to prevent oxidation or implementingthe better work practices of the other company. In the first case, in leadballast operations NNS has begun to paint lead ingots with an epoxy coatthat prevents oxidation and therefore eliminates resulting exposures (Ex.582-66, p. 22). OSHA is not clear whether NNS's coating of lead is limitedto lead ingots or whether all lead bricks and shims also are coated. OSHAsees no reason why all ballast materials cannot be coated, including thosethat have recently been sawed and have newly-exposed lead surfaces. GD,at one time, did coat at least some of its lead ballast, but GD now statesthat it has eliminated that practice because the slippery coating createddifficulty in handling the ballast. As a direct result of eliminating thepractice of coating, lead exposures in ballast operations at GD have significantlyincreased (Ex. 688b, p. 11). Since NNS seems to have been able to copewith that problem and since OSHA is assured that non-slippery coatingsare available to make coated ballast easier to handle (Ex. 610, pp. 21-22),OSHA is not persuaded by GD's assertions. The second case involves carbon arc gouging, where current exposure levelsare sometimes very high. NNS has claimed that there is no known engineeringtechnology that can control exposure levels to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. However,nothing in NNS's submission suggests that the company has explored controllingcarbon arc gouging by alternative methods. GD, on the other hand, has acknowledgedthat, in conjunction with local exhaust, exposure levels in this operationfrequently can be controlled to 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementing carefulwork practices involving the precise adjustment of the arc height so asto prevent penetration of the steel and volatilization of the lead belowthe gouge (Ex. 688B, p. 13). OSHA believes this work practice can be adoptedby NNS. However, because of the complexities of carbon arc gouging andthe uncertainty of alternatives, OSHA acknowledges that it may be necessaryfor workers performing this task to wear respirators for supplementaryprotection. Industry has made a number of other major objections to the feasibilityof achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineering and work practicecontrols in shipbuilding that OSHA wishes to address. These objectionsinvolve control problems in confined spaces, high exposure levels in shopswhere allegedly state-of-the-art engineering controls have been installed,production problems associated with controls for abrasive blasting, andcontractual problems associated with caulking as an alternative to tinningand bonding.With regard to operations in confined spaces onboard ship, industry arguesthat it is generally impossible to utilize engineering controls and thatwhere engineering controls have been used, exposure levels are significantlyabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Although OSHA recognizes that there can be problemsin using engineering controls in confined spaces, OSHA believes that inmany confined spaces portable local exhaust systems can be used (Ex. 610,p. 23). In addition, OSHA agrees with GD's statements that proper workpractices are crucial for local exhaust to be effective, because the positioningof the local exhaust largely determines its collection efficiency (Ex.688B, p. 2). Moreover, OSHA believes that some operations done in confinedspaces can be moved to fixed facilities offship, which can be more effectivelyequipped with ventilation systems. Finally, when individual employees havehigh 8-hour, time-weighted averages due to working in confined spaces,employers are authorized by paragraph (e) of the lead standard to use administrativecontrols to rotate employees, thus lowering the individual employee's exposuresto lead. Under some circumstances where all engineering and work practicecontrols have been implemented and 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ still has not beenachieved. OSHA recognizes that employers may have to rely on respiratorsas supplementary protection for employees performing operations in confinedspaces. Industry also argues that, where certain operations are performed offshipeven when allegedly state-of-the-art engineering controls are implemented,exposure levels still have not consistently achieved 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.However, NNS, the company making the objection, has not shown by its submissionthat it has implemented all available engineering and work practice controlsin such offship facilities as its lead shielding panel shop or panel cuttingshop. OSHA does not regard failure to achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ as proofof the infeasibility of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For example, in NNS'spanel cutting shop, NNS concedes that it has not locally exhausted or enclosedthe circular sawing of lead panels (Ex. 582-66, p. 14). With respect to abrasive blasting, one method of paint removal, industryargues that exposure levels are extremely high and that additional controlmeasures are impractical. Specifically, industry argues that the Blast`n' Vac system is too slow and can only be used for horizontal blastingand that in hydroblasting the water may cause flash rust, which, NNS contends,would require additional dry blasting to remove. As indicated above, OSHAbelieves that there are many methods, which can be used either singly orin combination, to remove lead paint while effectively controlling airlead levels. For example, in at least certain circumstances blasting canbe avoided entirely by the use of chemical cleaning (Ex. 582-66, p. 11).OSHA also agrees with its expert witness, Mr. Michael Larsen, who statedthat antioxidants could be added to the water used in hydroblasting toprevent oxidation altogether (Ex. 610, p. 20). Finally, the fact that itmay require more time to conduct an operation in a manner that adequatelyprotects employees does not, under the OSH Act, constitute proof of infeasibility.OSHA believes that, either alone or in combination with other methods,Blast `n' Vac or hydroblast can be effectively used to remove leaded paint.With regard to putative contractual problems associated with alternativesto tinning and bonding, industry agrees that caulking can be used to filllead joints around shielding panels but argues that caulking as a substitutefor burning is not always acceptable to clients like the Navy. This suggeststhat caulking is acceptable at times. Indeed, NNS acknowledges that caulkingis acceptable to the Navy on aircraft carriers and presumably on othernuclear surface vessels and further implies that even on nuclear submarinescaulking is allowed by the Navy to a limited extent as a substitute forburning (Ex. 582-66, pp. 18-19). Moreover, the record does not show anyattempt by industry to secure the Navy's approval of caulking as a substitutefor burning. The record does show, on the other hand, that industry wassuccessful in securing approval from the Navy for the use of lead-freepaint, which the Navy previously had prohibited (Ex. 582-66, p. 6). Consequently,OSHA believes contractual problems do not impose the degree of limitationon industry practice that NNS seems to suggest and that industry has atleast some flexibility in this regard to select the method of productionthat causes the lowest airborne lead levels. Finally, OSHA wishes to comment on the quality and method of presentationof the data supplied by this industry. First, despite the fact that OSHArequested raw air lead monitoring results, the two nuclear shipyards didnot supply OSHA with individual air lead monitoring results by job categoryfor a period of several years but, at best, submitted average air leadlevels or frequency distributions. Second, the averages appear to be arithmetic means. As a result, they haveonly limited reliability as indicators of air lead levels, since one orseveral very high monitoring results can upwardly skew the average. Forexample, at NNS one monitoring result for interior blaster during 1985-86was 60,000 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-66, Table II). This result dramaticallyskewed the arithmetic mean upward. Third, this problem is further compounded by the additional fact that averagesand frequency distributions submitted by NNS and GD incorporate exposurelevels for several years. As a consequence, OSHA cannot easily ascertainwhether recent exposure levels show any improvement. Consequently, OSHAhas had to discount certain industry data or evaluate it in conjunctionwith whatever other supplemental data were in the record. Last, NNS, the company that submitted the most extensive comment to therecord, claims that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ cannot be achieved exclusivelyby means of engineering and work practice controls. As indicated previously,NNS's contention contradicts its own submission to the record. That submissionshows that in 16 of 26 lead operations at NNS, representing over 85% ofall lead-exposed workers, most, or average air lead monitoring resultsalready are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The submission further indicatesthat, in three other operations, close to a majority of monitoring resultsalready are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 582-66, Table II). This levelof control has been achieved before taking into account OSHA's recommendedadditional controls, which, OSHA anticipates, will substantially reduceexposure levels in every operation where they are implemented. Thus, for all the above reasons, OSHA is unpersuaded by industry's argumentsthat the PEL cannot be achieved by means of engineering and work practicecontrols. Based upon its own expertise, experience, and the record evidence,OSHA concludes that a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is achievable in the shipbuildingand repair industry as a whole by means of engineering and work practicecontrols.<T3>Industry Profile. </T3>Of interest in this rulemaking are those establishmentsengaged in any of the following activities: nuclear shipbuilding, othernon-nuclear military and commercial shipbuilding, and ship repairing. Mostof these establishments are classified under Standard Industrial Code 3731,though there may also be small, captive yards for which the primary activityof the owner is something other than shipbuilding and repairing and whichmay fall under some other SIC classification. The sizes of the shipyardsand the types of vessels being built or repaired vary widely.Census data revealed 689 shipyards in SIC 3731 as of 1982 [Ex. 572, p.36]. Four hundred twenty of these shipyards were reported to employ fewerthan 50 workers. In its Addendum to its Analysis of the Shipbuilding andRepair Industry [Ex. 686b], Meridian places the number of shipyards inbusiness at 400 in 1986, with size distribution (by production employment)as follows: 1-20 production employees, 153 yards; 21-50, 82 yards; 51-100,70 yards; 101-200, 41 yards; 201-1000, 43 yards; and over 1000, 11 yards[Ex. 686b, pp. 2-3].Total shipyard employment was reported to be 139,900 in 1985 in SIC 3731[Ex. 572, p. 4]. Total production employment (employees performing bothconstruction and repair) as of October 1986 is estimated at 104,750 [Ex.686b, pp 2-3], or about 75 percent of the total shipbuilding and repairemployment.OSHA estimates that approximately 24,000 workers in shipbuilding and repairare potentially exposed to airborne lead. The portion of the workforcewhich is potentially exposed to lead through welding, cutting, painting,and blasting activities in non-nuclear shipyards is estimated to be 22,550[Exs. 686b, p. 2; 572, p. 70]. With regard to activities related solelyto nuclear yards, another 1,529 workers are estimated to be exposed [Exs.582-66, Table I; 688B].On a world scale, the ``commercial shipbuilding industry * * * is in thelongest and worst slump of the post-World War II period'' [Ex. 572, p.30], and competition is intense. Meridian reports that Japan's 37 percentof gross tonnage on order as of 1986 leads the world, with other majorcompetitors being West Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Singapore,Hong Kong, and Taiwan [Ex. 572, p. 30]. The U.S. industry has advantagesin its high quality and fast turn-around; it is not, however, competitivewith regard to price [Ex. 572, p. 30]. Indeed, foreign yards may actuallybuild a vessel at less than half the price charged by a U.S. yard [Ex.572, p. 32].In its report, Meridian Research noted that<ITAG tagnum="20">[t]he industry can be divided into ``first-tier'' and ``second-tier''shipyards. First-tier shipyards build and repair large ocean-going vesselsand naval vessels. Second-tier shipyards primarily build and repair barges,tugboats, and towboats used for inland and coastal water transportation;drill rigs, supply boats, and crewboats for the offshore service industry;and fishing vessels [Ex. 572, p. 1].</ITAG>Distinctions are also made between shipbuilding and ship repair yards,major shipyards, and the Active Shipbuilding Base. In general,<ITAG tagnum="20">a shipbuilding yard must have at least one shipbuilding position an_inclinedway, a side launching platform, or a building basin_while a repair yarddoes not have such a position [Ex. 572, p. 36].</ITAG>Major Shipyards are the largest facilities and in 1986 there were 25 suchyards employing just under 102,000 total workers [Ex. 572, pp. 38-41].A Major Repair facility may construct ships smaller than 475 feet in length.In 1986 there were 30 major repair facilities employing about 8,400 workers[Ex. 572, pp. 38, 42-44]. Major Topside Repair facilities, of which therewere 38 in 1986, may construct the same size vessels as the Major Repairyards, and may also have dry-docks. Approximately 6,900 workers are employedin these facilities [Ex. 572, pp. 38, 45-48].The Maritime Administration defines the Active Shipbuilding Base as thoseshipyards that are open and currently engaged in or seeking contracts forthe construction of ships of 1,000 gross tons or more. There were 22 suchyards in 1986 compared with 24 in 1985 and 26 in 1980. Employment for thisgroup of yards is estimated at 72% of the total workforce in SIC 3731 [Ex.572, p. 45]. Of these 22 yards, 19 are Major Shipbuilding yards and 3 areMajor Topside Repair yards. In 1986, 9 yards were engaged in constructionand/or conversion of major combat ships for the Navy, 6 yards were engagedprimarily in ship construction and conversion work for the Navy's T-shipprogram, 3 yards were engaged in the construction of 7 commercial vessels,and 4 yards were engaged in only repair and overhaul work and non-shipconstruction [Ex. 572, p. 45]. There are currently only two private shipyardsin the United States which construct nuclear-powered vessels.With regard to small yards, <ITAG tagnum="20">[t]here are virtually no data on shipyards with fewer than 20 employeesas a group. Shipyards of this size tend to be excluded from discussion_andseem almost to be excluded from verbal definitions_of the shipbuildingand repair industry * * * [Ex. 572, p. 50].</ITAG>These small yards make up about one-third of the total number of yardswhile accounting for about 2.2 percent of total employment [Ex. 686b, pp.2-3].Commercial production in first-tier yards (which includes all of the yardsin the Active Shipbuilding Base) has been minimal since 1980, with no newmerchant vessel contracts entered into in 1985 or in 1986 [Ex. 687-3].First-tier yards are also engaged in Naval construction, however, and thishas been their strength, as substantial orders for construction and repairwork were contracted for in 1986 [Ex. 572, p. 18]. In second-tier yards,production of nearly all types of power-driven vessels and barges declinedmarkedly between 1982 and 1984 [Ex. 572, p. 18]. Repair work in second-tieryards has also declined, but stability can be found in some areas [Ex.572, p. 24].Regarding commercial shipbuilding demand, Meridian pointed out that<ITAG tagnum="20">[d]emand for commercial shipbuilding is a derived demand. It dependson several factors, which include demand for shipping services, size andcapacity of available fleet, and extent of foreign competition * * *. Noneof these has favored U.S. commercial shipbuilding in recent years [Ex.572, p. 24].</ITAG>Worldwide overcapacity was specifically cited by Meridian as an importantproblem with respect to the demand for commercial shipbuilding [Ex. 572,pp. 24, 28].Subsidies are available in the form of Construction Differential Subsidy(CDS) grants or financing guarantees (Title XI of the Merchant Marine Actof 1936 and amended in 1972). No CDS contracts were awarded in fiscal year1985, while commitments approved in that year for financing guaranteestotaled $20 million, with pending applications for $99 million more [Ex.572, pp. 28-29].With respect to repair work, the strongest element in the market is theNavy's ship repair and maintenance program, with commercial yards gettingabout one-third of this work [Ex. 572, p. 29]. The National Defense ReserveFleet (NDRF) is also a source of repair work, with $45 to $60 million inannual work expected for the 86 ship Ready Reserve Force [Ex. 572, pp.29-30]. Meridian points out that U.S. yards are more competitive in theworld repair market than they are in construction (Ex. 572, p. 29].Aggregated 1986 Dun andamp; Bradstreet financial data (SIC 3731) for theindustry as a whole indicate that the mean return on sales was about 1.8%[Ex. 572, p. 53]. Disaggregated data show a somewhat higher mean returnon sales for small firms (under $1,000,000 in assets) and a negative meanrate of return on sales for some larger firms, though third quartile returnon sales figures approached 3 percent for these firms [Ex. 572, pp. 53-54].No establishment-specific financial data were provided during the publiccomment period or the public hearing for the non-nuclear shipyards. Companydata on nuclear shipyards indicate average operating profits for 1986 ofapproximately $200,000,000 [Ex. 572, p. 56].<T3>Costs of Compliance. </T3>The compliance costs for the Shipbuildingand Repair sector consist of costs for enclosed bandsaw booths (used duringthe sawing of lead pigs into ballast for nuclear submarines), HEPA vacuums,and for controlled blasting units. Required improvements for casting operationsare minimal, and thus costs were assumed to be negligible. Ventilationfor ``hot work'' (welding, burning, cutting, etc.) performed in the assemblyshop or on board vessels is estimated to be currently in use, and thusno costs will be incurred for this equipment [Ex. 572, pp. 60, 64]. Additionally,no costs were assumed to be incurred in the substituting of caulking forburning, since both techniques require local ventilation. Also, no costshave been estimated for the coating of lead ballast to reduce exposuresduring ballast passing, as one of the two yards is currently working todevelop a suitable coating [Ex. 688B] and the other is already coatinga part of its lead ballast with epoxy paint [Ex. 582-66, p. 22]. Additionalcosts attributable to this rule are assumed to be negligible. An enclosed bandsaw booth is estimated to cost $12,000. Annual costs includeannualized capital charges of $1,762 plus operation and maintenance costsof $1,200 for a total of $2,962 [Ex. 572, pp 64-65]. The cost of a portable vacuum is estimated to be $3,900 [Ex. 579, p. 29].Annualized capital costs would be $572, while operation and maintenancecosts would be $2,390. (Annual operation and maintenance costs were estimatedto be 10 percent of capital costs plus $2,000 per year for HEPA filterreplacement). It is estimated that two sweepers will be required for eachnuclear shipyard. Additional labor is estimated to be $4,060 annually,based on 1 person-hour per day, 7 days per week, and 50 weeks per yearat an average wage of $11.60. Total annual costs for vacuum sweeping arethus estimated to be $8,840. The cost of a vacuum-controlled blasting unit is estimated to be $5,060per unit. Annual costs (computed using an expected useful life of fiveyears) would amount to $1,335 in annualized capital charges only; operationand maintenance expenses are expected to be offset by the savings realizeddue to the environmental efficiency of the equipment. (That is, the recommendedequipment eliminates considerable expense for clean-up) [Ex. 572, p. 66].The cost of the wet blasting unit is estimated to be $360. Annual costsfor this unit include $207 in annualized capital charges (using an expecteduseful life of two years) plus $36 in annual operation and maintenancecosts for a total annual cost of $243 [Ex. 572, p. 65]. Total industry costs for controlled blasting are based on allocating theaverage number of controlled blasting units required per yard accordingto the number of potentially exposed workers per yard. Tables 1 and 2 providea summary of the average number of blasting units required per yard, thenumber of yards, and the total annual costs for each of six shipyard sizecategories and for each of the three types of shipyards. Table 1 addressesthe vacuum blast option and Table 2 addresses the wet blast option. Usingthis methodology, total annual costs of $11,026,110 are expected to berequired for vacuum units and $8,469,738 for the wet blast units. Whilethe wet blasting units appear less costly than the vacuum units, the wetblast units will produce a lead-contaminated solution which will need tobe disposed of as a hazardous waste in accordance with EPA regulations,at additional cost to the shipyard. Also, this method of controlled blastingmay oxidize the stripped surface and thus may necessitate a dry blast toremove the oxidation at additional cost [Ex. 582-66, p. 10]. In addition to the annualized capital costs of vacuum units, the annualcost amount presented in Table 1 includes costs for additional labor, asthe vacuum blast system may require more time to use than conventionalblasting equipment [Ex. 582-66, p. 9]. It is assumed that one additionalworker will be hired for every 10 blasting units, wet or vacuum. Additionalcosts for these workers are based on an annual total compensation costof $33,750. Since the environmental waste disposal problem exists for wetblast units, OSHA assumes in this analysis that industry will opt for thevacuum units. Cost estimates for these units as developed in this analysisoverstate actual costs to the extent that leaded paints are being replacedwith non-leaded coatings. That is, costs will decline over time as non-leadedcoatings are substituted for coatings containing lead. The total annual costs for nuclear shipyards include costs for bandsawenclosures (six for each yard), HEPA vacuums, and 50 blasting units. Totalannual costs for the bandsaw enclosures are estimated to be $17,772, totalannual costs for vacuum sweeping were estimated at $8,840, and total annualcosts for the blasting units would be $235,500. Total annual costs foreach of the two nuclear yards would thus be $262,112. Total annual costsfor non-nuclear yards are for vacuum blasting units only, and appear inTable 1. Cost per yard will vary, depending upon the number of blastingunits that are required. Annual costs range from $4,710 for the smallestyards to $235,500 for the largest. As shown in Table 1, total annual costsfor non-nuclear construction yards are estimated to be $5,284,620 and thosefor non-nuclear repair yards are estimated to be $5,270,490. Total industry costs would be $11,079,334. This total includes $524,224for the nuclear segment of the industry and $10,555,110 for non-nuclearyards.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Costs of Vacuum Blasting Units</T4><H1>Shipyard size and related variables</H1><H1>Nuclear construction yards</H1><H1>Non-nuclear construction yards</H1><H1>Rapair yards</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1-20 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D> </D><D>1 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D> </D><D>$4,710 </D><D>$4,710</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D> </D><D>18 </D><D>135</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21-50 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D> </D><D>2 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D> </D><D>$9,420 </D><D>$9,420</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D> </D><D>33 </D><D>49</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51-100 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D> </D><D>3 </D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D/><D>$14,130 </D><D>$18,840</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D> </D><D>36 </D><D>34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101-200 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D> </D><D>5 </D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D> </D><D>$23,550 </D><D>$37,680</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D> </D><D>21 </D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">200-1000 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D> </D><D>17 </D><D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D> </D><D>$80,070 </D><D>$141,300</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D> </D><D>25 </D><D>18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;1000 Production workers <D> </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of blasting units/yd <D>50 </D><D>50 </D><D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual cost/yd <D>$235,500 </D><D>$235,500 </D><D>$235,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of yards <D>2 </D><D>8 </D><D>1</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Summed Annual Costs <D>$471,000 </D><D>$5,284,620 </D><D>$5,270,490</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Total Annual Costs <D> </D><D> </D><D>$11,026,110</D><F>Source: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of RegulatoryAnalysis.

These yards shouldbe able to pass all costs through to the government. Though Mr. James R.Thornton of Newport News Shipbuilding, one of the two yards performingnuclear construction for the government, commented that its Navy contracts``are `fixed price' and do not allow for recovery of costs in excess ofthe fixed or ceiling price'' [Ex. 582-66, p. 1], alternatives for the Navyare limited. Even if contractural arrangements preclude the immediate pass-throughof the $262,112 in annual costs borne by each yard, which would necessitatea price increase of about 0.02 percent based on sales of $1.65 billion[Ex. 572, p. 71], it does not appear that the nuclear shipyards would beadversely affected by these annual costs. Costs of this regulation wouldbe expected to reduce the average operating profit of $200 million forthese yards by about 0.13 percent. There are 141 non-nuclear construction yards and 257 non-nuclear repairyards [Ex. 686b, p. 3]. 1986 Shipments data and profit information brokenout by function and size pertaining to these yards appear in Table 3, alongwith costs incurred for vacuum blast units and impact ratios.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Summary of Economic Impacts for Non-Nuclear Construction and RepairYards_Vacuum Blast</T4><H1>Size class</H1><H1>Sales ($ thous.) </H1>a<H2>C</H2>d<H2>R </H2>e<H1>Profits ($ thous.) </H1>b<H2>C</H2><H2>R</H2><H1>Costs ($ thous.)</H1><H2>C</H2><H2>R</H2><H1>Ratio: costs/sales</H1><H2>C</H2><H2>R</H2><H1>Ratio: costs/profit </H1>c<H2>C</H2><H2>R</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">1-20<D>1376</D><D>1330</D><D>71.55</D><D>69.16</D><D>4.71</D><D>4.71</D><D>0.00342</D><D>0.00354</D><D>0.05198</D><D>0.05415</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21-50<D>3753</D><D>3538</D><D>^67.55</D><D>^63.68</D><D>9.42</D><D>9.42</D><D>0.00251</D><D>0.00266</D><D>^0.13944</D><D>^0.14792</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51-100<D>7568</D><D>7285</D><D>^136.22</D><D>^131.13</D><D>14.13</D><D>18.84</D><D>0.00187</D><D>0.00259</D><D>^0.10373</D><D>^0.14367</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101-200<D>14743</D><D>13932</D><D>^265.37</D><D>^250.78</D><D>23.55</D><D>37.68</D><D>0.00160</D><D>0.00270</D><D>^0.08874</D><D>^0.15025</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">201-1000<D>46564</D><D>36120</D><D>1350.36</D><D>1047.48</D><D>80.07</D><D>141.30</D><D>0.00172</D><D>0.00391</D><D>0.03914</D><D>0.08903</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;1000<D>328176</D><D>136224</D><D>9517.10</D><D>3950.50</D><D>235.50</D><D>235.50</D><D>0.00072</D><D>0.00173</D><D>0.01633</D><D>0.03934</D><F/>a Sales were obtained by subtracting sales of nuclear yards fromtotal industry shipments and allocating the remaining shipments value amongsize classes by share of production employment.

The price increases required to passthe costs of compliance forward are small, ranging from a low of about0.07 percent for the largest construction yards to a high of 0.40 percentfor repair yards with between 201 and 1,000 production employees. Cost pass-through, at least partially, should be possible for all yards,including those doing construction and repair work for the U.S. Navy andfor those yards operating in protected or captive markets. If the costs of compliance were to be absorbed by these firms, the impactson profits can be estimated from the cost to profit ratio. Costs representonly about 1.6 percent of profits for construction yards with over 1,000production employees but could increase losses over 15 percent for repairyards with between 101 and 200 production employees. It should be notedthat the tax-deductibility of compliance costs was taken into account incomputing profit impacts. That is, care was taken to compute before-taxprofit before subtracting annual costs. After subtracting annual costs,the appropriate average tax rate (either 21 or 34 percent) was then reappliedto determine after-tax profit net of costs. Profits were calculated usingan average financial statement [Ex. 572, pp. 53-54] and based on 1986 dataprovided by Dun and Bradstreet. (See footnote ``b,'' Table 3.) More specifically, in three size categories, namely 21-50, 51-100, and101-200 production employees, many construction and repair firms are notprofitable. Should the demand for commercial shipbuilding not improve inthe near future, many construction firms in these size categories may nolonger be in operation at the time the standard takes effect. For thosechoosing to continue operations, full absorption of compliance costs couldincrease losses up to 14 percent. Full absorption of compliance costs couldincrease losses in some repair yards by as much as 15 percent. While these profit impacts appear substantial, there are other points toconsider in assessing the impacts of the rulemaking on these firms. Oneis that both repair yards and construction yards which perform repair inthese size groups should benefit from the repair work required for theReady Reserve Force of the U.S. Navy, as this work is required by law tobe performed by U.S. shipyards [Ex. 572, pp. 29-30]. Also, a substantialamount of second-tier repair work is reported to be protected by legislation[Ex. 572, p. 77]. Second-tier repair of vessels traveling on U.S. waterwaysis also assured due to the fact that many of these vessels do not traveloverseas [Ex. 572, p. 77]. A final consideration is that full cost absorptionwill reduce ROS for both categories of shipyard in these three size classesfrom ^1.8 percent to about ^2.1 percent, on average. These changes in ROSreflect the relatively low magnitude of the costs of compliance, as noyard in these three size categories is expected to incur more than $38,000in total annual costs. Absorbing the costs of compliance fully would impact profits for the remaining(profitable) shipyards by between 1.6 and 8.9 percent. The smallest yardswould realize profit reductions of 5.2 to 5.4 percent, the largest yardscould experience reductions of 1.6 to 3.9 percent, and the 201-1,000 employeecategory could see reductions of 3.9 to 8.9 percent. It should be notedthat this latter category contains a number of major yards which are partof the Active Shipbuilding Base and demand for U.S. Navy ships will continueto provide construction work for these yards. Post-compliance ROS for thesmallest yards was estimated to be 4.9 percent; for the 201-1,000 employeecategory, a range of 2.6 (for repair yards) to 2.9 percent (for constructionyards) was estimated; and for the largest yards, a range of 2.8 (for repairyards) to 2.9 (for construction yards) was estimated. OSHA recognizes that the shipbuilding and repair industry in this countryis in a state of contraction. The number of shipyards in operation hasfallen from 689 in 1982 to the current estimate of approximately 400, adecrease of 42 percent. These data, coupled with the reported worldwideshipping overcapacity, indicate that this contraction is likely to continue.The impact of the OSHA lead rulemaking should not be a significant factorin the restructuring of this industry which is occurring in response tothe prevailing economic environment. OSHA notes that the issue of availability with regard to the wet blastunits was raised in the record [Ex. 686b, pp. 11-12]; though a complianceperiod extension might prove useful to the manufacturer(s) of the wet blasttechnology, OSHA does not believe that such an extension is necessary.The two and one-half year compliance schedule should allow sufficient timeto expand production (as noted by one manufacturer [Ex. 686b, p. 11]).OSHA concludes that the standard, as it applies to the Shipbuilding andRepair industry, is economically feasible in an extended compliance periodof two and one-half years. Larger yards performing work for the U.S. Navy,both nuclear and non-nuclear, should have the ability to pass forward allcompliance costs. Additionally, worldwide overcapacity suggests that manymarginal yards employing 21-200 workers will no longer be in operationat the end of the two and one-half year compliance schedule. Many othershipyards should be able to pass forward most, if not all, of the costincreases identified in this analysis due to the existence of protectedand captive markets. Combinations of cost pass-through and cost absorptionwill reduce the respective magnitudes of the impacts associated with eachcompliance scheme to levels that should not materially worsen the competitiveor financial status for these yards. Finally, all yards will benefit fromthe two and one-half year compliance schedule, allowing additional timeto raise capital and/or effect gradual price increases.<T3>Stevedoring Process Description and Exposure Areas.</T3> Stevedoringinvolves loading and unloading ores to and from ships. A typical stevedoringoperation takes several days or several shifts to complete. The ores areeither loaded from dockside warehouses to ships or unloaded from shipsdirectly to trucks or gondola railcars positioned along side the ship.The ores can also be stockpiled in dockside warehouses for later land transitor loading aboard ships (Exs. 475-17, H-004E, p. 1; Ex. 582-14, p. 1).Initially lead ores are unloaded or loaded by gantry cranes or mobile cranesthat use clamshell buckets to pick up the ore. During this phase of theoperation, longshoremen are not present onboard the ship (Ex. 5B2-14, p.1). As the pile is worked down, industrial front-end loaders are loweredinto the hatch to pile the ore in the center of the ship to be picked upby cranes. Near the end of the job, sweepers/trimmers shovel and/or sweepthe remaining ore from between the vessel ribs into the clamshell bucketto be lifted out of the hatch (Exs. 475-17, H-004E, p. 2; 577; 582-14,p. 1). Workers are potentially exposed to lead whenever the ores being loadedor unloaded contain lead. Dockside workers (crane operators, foremen, gangworkers) may be exposed to blowing dust from stockpiles, vessel operations,and spills. Employees working in the hatch (foremen, operators of cranesand front-end loaders, sweepers/trimmers) are generally subjected to higherlevels of lead exposure than dockside workers because they are closer tothe ore and may be working in limited spaces. (Ex. 686G, p. 3).<T3>Exposure Levels and Controls Currently Used.</T3> In stevedoring, themost recent exposure data in the record indicate that in almost all operationsexposure levels are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 612, p. 5). OSHA has relied primarily on current data gathered by OSHA expert witnessHoward Spielman, president of Health Science Associates (HSA). These comprehensivedata consist of 201 8-hour, time-weighted average (TWA) exposures determinedfrom samples gathered in 1984-85 during five complete stevedoring leadore transfers. The HSA data reveal that 85% of all samples are at or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and in 10 of 11 operations a majority of samples alsoare at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Exs. 612, p. 8; 686G, pp. 4, 5). Exposures of almost all employees who worked on deck and dockside werebelow the action level. Specifically, 97% of those exposures were below30 andCx.18;g/m\3\ while only 3 of 148 sample results exceeded 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\(Ex. 612, pp. 5, 8). For work inside the hatch where exposure levels generally are higher, intwo of the three operations a majority of sample results are at or belowthe action level. In one of those operations, bulldozing, 68% of the sampleresults were at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and 59% of the sample resultswere below the action level. These results were obtained even though noneof the bulldozers had enclosed cabs (Ex. 612, pp. 3, 9). In the HSA data, the only operation that has exposure levels consistentlyabove 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ is sweeping/trimming. Spielman reported that allsweeping/trimming to remove remaining ore was done manually with brooms,shovels and hoes (Ex. 612, p. 2). No HEPA vacuums or water spraying systemsto suppress dust levels were in use; the operation was virtually uncontrolled.Exposure levels ranged from 17 to 1,348 andCx.18;g/m\3\, with an averageof 292 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 612, p. 9). OSHA notes, however, that excessivelyhigh exposures in one out of 34 work shifts upwardly skewed the overallaverage (Ex. 612, Att. 4, Table IX). The average for that one particularshift was 939 andCx.18;g/m\3\, while the average for the other shifts wasonly 113 andCx.18;g/m\3\. There was no explanation of whether any spillsor any particular atmospheric condition affected the sample results ofthat shift. As previously noted, engineering controls were not used during these transfers,but workers were trained in the hazards of lead exposure prior to eachshift. Spielman also reported the ore was damp because it was exposed to``ocean atmospheric conditions'' during transit. Those conditions, in effect,acted similarly to water spray systems used to suppress lead dust duringloading and unloading. In any event, even without implementation of engineeringcontrols, the HSA data indicate that almost all stevedoring operationsare currently at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 612, pp. 8, 9). OSHA data, collected from one site during a 1984 inspection, corroboratethe HSA data. The OSHA data show that only one of seven workers (job titlesnot specified) was exposed over 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. That employee was exposedto 67 andCx.18;g/m\3\ which indicates that, with just a slight improvementin controls, exposure levels for all employees should be controlled toor below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 577, p. 7). The degree of control achieved recently by stevedoring companies throughwork practices reflects a significant reduction in lead exposures overa short period of time. For example, in 1982 ASARCO reported that exposuresfor all crews were uniformly above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ and often above 200andCx.18;g/m\3\, even though the moisture content of the ore was 4.5% anda fogging nozzle was also used to wet down the ore before unloading andafter every 6 to 8 railcars had been loaded. Average exposures were 180andCx.18;g/m\3\ for foremen, 415 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for payloader operators and211 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for sweepers/trimmers. The fact that the exposure rangefor sweepers/trimmers was 130 to 310 andCx.18;g/m\3\, significantly lowerthan the range reported in HSA's data during one particular shift, alsosupports OSHA's finding that the high levels in that shift were aberrant(Exs. 2-7, H-004S, p. 7; 577, p. 4). OSHA notes that on the day the ASARCO data were collected holes were foundin the rubber sock, a chute-like device used to reduce the amount of oreblown during discharge of ore from the clamshell bucket (Ex. 2-7, H-004S,p. 3). The empty clamshell returning to the hold also dropped ore whichhad adhered to the sides of the clamshell. In addition, gusty winds werepresent that day which, in combination with the spills from the clamshellbucket, are likely to have contributed to the high exposure levels of docksideworkers, who normally would have low exposures (Ex. 2-7, H-004S, p. 3).As stated above, very few control measures are currently employed by thestevedoring industry to reduce employee exposure to lead. Although thecontrols that are currently used (i.e., rubber sock and water spray) contributeto the reduction of employee exposures to lead, they are designed to reducedust emissions in general and not specifically to reduce the lead exposuresof employees handling the ore (Exs. 577, p. 24; 583-63, p. 1). Currently,work practice controls are the primary means used by stevedoring companiesto reduce employee exposures to lead. Spielman reported that most shiftsin the hatch are limited to less than 4 hours, employees are trained atthe beginning of each shift in the hazards of lead exposure and foremenobserving work in progress initiate corrective actions as appropriate (Ex.612, pp. 3-4). Some stevedoring companies are starting to use cranes andfront-end loaders with enclosed cabs to move the ore and suction trucksinstead of using manual sweeping/trimming (Ex. 583-63, p. 1).<T3>Additional Controls.</T3> OSHA's analysis of the record in the previoussection indicates that in almost all operations exposure levels alreadyare at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ most of the time (Exs. 577, pp. 4, 8;612, pp. 8-9). Eighty-five percent of all sampling results are at or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, and a majority of sampling results in 10 of 11 operationsare at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. In addition, the vast majority of allsampling results are below the action level. Based upon that record andOSHA's own experience and expertise, the Agency has concluded that in nearlyall operations exposure levels can be controlled consistently to or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ with a modest modification or addition of controls, suchas improving work practices, housekeeping, and maintenance or, in certainsituations, enclosing cabs of mobile equipment. In sweeping/trimming, theonly operation where exposure levels are not already at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\controlling exposures to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ will require implementationof some engineering controls (e.g., HEPA vacuums or slurry pumping systems)as well as additional work practice controls (Ex. 686G, pp. 6-7; Tr. 359,368-69). OSHA finds that in the stevedoring industry there are many available andsimple engineering controls to further reduce employee exposure to lead,if necessary. For example, if exposures of mobile equipment operators area problem, they can be reduced significantly by enclosing cabs and equippingthem with tempered air and HEPA filters (Ex. 686G, p. 6). To ensure thatoperators keep the cab doors closed, a communication system, such as two-wayradios, should also be provided. These control technologies have provensuccessful in other industries and OSHA determines that these controlscan be applied to the stevedoring industry to consistently control exposurelevels to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (Ex. 604, p. 4). There are other available engineering controls that can be implementedin this industry to reduce employee exposures. The exposures of employeescan be reduced during loading and unloading by the use of the properlymaintained rubber sock over the clamshell bucket to confine dust emissionsas the ore is being discharged (Ex. 2-7, p. 5). The use of clamshell bucketsto move the ore may even be replaced by automated, enclosed conveyor andchute systems which will eliminate employee exposures due to spillagesfrom overloading the clamshell bucket (Ex. 577, p. 25). Finally, the useof two-ton superbags, otherwise known as Flexible Intermodal Bulk Containers(FIBCs), is another alternative to loading and unloading lead ore as aloose bulk cargo. FIBCs completely contain the ore, thus minimizing oreliminating the potential emission of dust. FIBCs have been used successfullyin the stevedoring industry to handle other hazardous materials and havebeen tried with lead ore (Ex. 583-63, p. 1). OSHA determines that the useof FIBCs should largely eliminate the overexposure of workers in this industry.In addition to engineering controls, good work practices are essentialto achieve 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. They also are effective and low-cost waysof reducing employee exposure to lead. For example, standing upwind ofthe discharge pile and away from the immediate vicinity of the emissionssource will reduce the exposure levels of both dockside and hatch workers(Ex. 577, pp. 24-25). Frequent wetting of the ore with a fogging nozzleor other water sprayers to suppress blowing dust will further reduce employeeexposures. HSA reported that the lead ore in the five transfers was dampdue to ocean atmospheric conditions. The HSA data indicate that maintainingthe dampness of the ore is a successful method to control employee exposures(Ex. 612, p. 1). Exposures that result from spillages can also be reduced by appropriatework practices. By exercising greater care in crane operation so the clamshellbucket is not overloaded and by machining down the ridge of the bucketso lead ore does not adhere to the sides, spillages will be minimized,thus reducing exposure levels of employees. In the event of a spillage,immediate wetting down or vacuuming the spills will also control employeeexposures (46 FR 6221, January 21, 1981; Ex. 620). With regard to sweeping/trimming, the only operation in which exposuresare generally above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, exposure levels can be reduced toor below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ through implementation of simple work practicesand engineering controls which are readily available. The exposures ofsweepers/trimmers can be reduced significantly by using a vacuum collectionsystem rather than manually sweeping the remaining ore in the hatch. Insteadof dry-sweeping, sweepers/trimmers can also wash down remaining materialto create a slurry that can be pumped to dockside stockpiles or railroadcars (Ex. 686G, p. 7). Not only will this technique contribute to the reductionof exposure for sweepers/trimmers, but also it will reduce exposures ofdockside workers by minimizing dust blowing from stockpiles (Tr. 359).In cases where manual sweeping/trimming continues to be used, providingportable ventilation systems should reduce exposure levels of these employees.Implementation of administrative controls, which are part of work practicecontrols, will complement the effectiveness of engineering controls. Forexample, limiting the number of hours sweepers/trimmers spend in the hatchor making sure these employees stay out of the hatch until after the front-endloaders have finished their operation will greatly reduce their exposurelevels (Ex. 612, pp. 2-4). According to Spielman, sweepers/trimmers workedless than 4 hours in the hatch during any one shift (Ex. 612, p. 3).<T3>Technological Feasibility Conclusion.</T3> Based upon the above analysisof the evidence in the record and OSHA's experience and expertise, theAgency determines that achieving a PEL of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by implementingreadily available and work practice controls is technologically feasiblefor the stevedoring industry as a whole. Through its analysis of the record, OSHA has demonstrated that in the stevedoringindustry exposure levels for almost all operations already are at or below50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. This conclusion is in part based upon the fact that foralmost all operations almost all sampling results are at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\.OSHA's conclusion is also predicated upon its determination that for thoseoperations where exposure levels are above 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, exposure levelscan be controlled consistently to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by modest improvementsin engineering or work practice controls. These readily available controlsinclude installing enclosed cabs on mobile equipment; supplying these cabswith filtered air, HEPA filters and communication systems; wetting downthe ore and spillages; using automated conveyor and chute systems; andreplacing bulk cargo handling with FIBCs (Exs. 577, pp. 24-26; 612, p.6). For sweeping/trimming, the only operation which is not currently at orbelow 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, OSHA has determined that implementation of someengineering controls and improved work practices can reduce employee exposurelevels consistently to or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. For this operation, engineeringcontrols, such as vacuum and slurry pumping systems, are readily available.Maintaining lead ores wet throughout unloading and loading and limitingthe time workers are in the hatch will substantially reduce employee exposureto lead dust. When these engineering and work practice controls are properlyimplemented, OSHA concludes that exposure levels in all stevedoring operationsshould be at or below 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Industry has raised a number of objections that OSHA wishes to address.In most of these objections industry argues that it should be exemptedfrom paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard (Exs. 2-7, p. 6; 475-15, H-004E,p. 5; 582-1, p. 1). First, industry commenters argue the stevedoring industry should be exemptedfrom paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard, because current employee exposurelevels that exceed 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ are intermittent and no employee isexposed above the PEL for more than 30 days per year (Ex. 582-1, p. 1).Although, it appears on the basis of the record evidence that no employeecurrently is exposed above the PEL for more than 30 days per year. TheAgency nonetheless must reject the request for an industry-wide exemption.Even if no employee is currently exposed above the PEL for more than 30days per year, these conditions may change. Demand for lead ore may increaseor certain employers may choose to handle more shipments. Where employeesare or become exposed above the PEL for more than 30 days in a year, OSHAis obligated to enforce the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) that the employerimplement work practice and engineering controls to comply with the PEL.For that reason, among others, it would be inappropriate to grant an exemptionto the industry from paragraph (e)(1). Individual employers, and indeed all employers, may currently be entitledto the 30-day exemption in paragraph (e)(1), but that is not within theprovince of this rulemaking, which is examining the feasibility for theentire stevedoring industry of achieving 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\ by means of engineeringand work practice controls. In an enforcement proceeding on a citationfor failure to implement paragraph (e)(1), an individual employer may showas a complete defense that he or she is exempt from the requirements ofthat paragraph. If the employer qualifies for the exemption, he or shestill must comply with the PEL, but may do so using any combination ofcontrols, including respirators. Employers who can demonstrate that noneof their employees are exposed above the PEL for more than 30 days peryear will not be impacted by paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard. Second, the stevedoring industry contends that the stevedoring industryshould be exempted from paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard because itlacks the legal capacity to control exposures because the mobile equipmentare not owned by the stevedoring companies (Exs. 2-5, p. 2; 475-17, H-004E,p. 1). OSHA does not regard the lack of ownership of the equipment as proofof infeasibility, since individual stevedoring companies can make appropriatecontractual agreements with the owners of the equipment. Third, industry contends that the stevedoring industry should be exemptedbecause if it has to comply with paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard,insurance carriers will stop insuring lead ore operations due to anticipatedworker compensation claims. OSHA rejects this contention. since the recordindicates that the reason some insurance companies have terminated coveragefor stevedoring employees is due to the industry's lack of compliance withthe lead standard. For example, one insurance company stated explicitlyby letter to a stevedoring company that it was unwilling to insure thehandling of lead ore unless the stevedore took measures to control employeeexposures (Ex. 2-1, H-004S, pp. 3-4). Fourth, industry contends the stevedoring industry should be exempted fromparagraph (e)(1) of the lead standard because stevedoring companies areunwilling to invest in such controls and may refuse to handle lead oresas a result (Exs. 2-1, H-004S, pp. 3-4; 582-1, p. 2; 582-5, p. 3; 582-9,p. 1). OSHA believes this is very unlikely to happen. In order to protectworkers, OSHA regulates many substances, and industry nonetheless continuesto handle or produce those substances. In any event, OSHA has no controlover any stevedoring company's decision on whether to handle lead ores.The Agency is mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970to develop and implement safety and health regulations to protect workersto the extent feasible. OSHA is not authorized to grant exemptions thateffectively deny workers protection from health and safety hazards simplybecause an industry does not wish to expend the necessary effort to complywith a standard. Finally, OSHA also determines that two other issues raised by industrycommenters concerning the solubility of lead sulfide ores and health effectsare not within the scope of the present remand rulemaking (Exs. 2-1, H-004S,pp. 5-8; 2-5, H-004S, p. 2; 475-17, H-004E; 582-5). In conclusion, based on its analysis of the record, OSHA has determinedthat in the stevedoring industry it is technologically feasible to achievethe PEL exclusively by means of engineering and work practice controls.<T3>Industry Profile.</T3> Stevedoring companies are those companies whicharrange for the manpower to load or unload cargo from seagoing vessels.They are classified under SIC 4463. The estimated number of stevedoring firms is 640, though only a minorityof these firms are located in ports that handle lead shipments. Althoughsome stevedoring companies may specialize in handling lead ores, it appearsthat, in any major port, there are several firms, perhaps a half dozenor more, that handle such cargo [Ex. 577, p. 19]. Total employment is estimated at 59,456 employees. This workforce has ahigh turnover rate, with workers entering, leaving, and re-entering theindustry with relatively high frequency. Very few of these employees areinvolved in handling lead ore [Ex. 577, p. 2]. Information indicates thatabout 7 shifts and a crew of 10 to 14 workers per shift are required tounload a shipment of ore [Exs. 582-5, p. 9; 612, pp. 2-4]. Assuming 25to 30 shipments per year yields a total of 2,100 to 2,500 workers potentiallyexposed to lead. This total represents no more than 4.2 percent of thetotal workforce. The demand for stevedoring services is dependent upon the volume of materialbeing traded. Import/export data for the period 1976-1986 tabulated byU.S. customs districts and by weight of the lead content of ore show thatimports have been transported largely by rail. Total tonnage of importswas quite variable throughout the period, with no clear trend evident.Data for more recent years (1985-1986) indicate that imports by vesselhave increased. With regard to exports of lead ore, vessel share has beenon a long term downward trend [Ex. 577, pp. 10-15]. An examination of geographical distribution shows that waterborne importsof lead ore have been concentrated in a limited number of customs districts,notably St. Louis, Missouri, Seattle, Washington, and Houston-Galveston,Texas. Waterborne imports through these districts, however, have been erratic[Ex. 577, pp. 10-15]. Waterborne exports have most recently been handled through Seattle, Washington,New Orleans, Louisiana, and Portland, Oregon [Ex. 577. p 12]. Over the last decade, only a few ports have handled more than one or twoshipments of lead ore annually. The inability to acquire insurance has been cited by some commenters asone reason for foregoing the handling of lead bearing ores [Ex. 577, p.16]. Financial data for SIC 4463 (Marine Cargo Handling) were obtained fromRobert Morris Associates and indicate an industrywide median profit beforetaxes to total assets ratio of 3.1% for the latest reporting period (5/30/85to 3/31/86). Ratios for earlier reporting periods, '83-'84 and '84-'85,were 1.8% and 5.5%, respectively [Ex. 577, p. 21]. Both average net salesand average profit before taxes increased between '83-'84 and '84-'85 industrywide(by 10% and 800%) but decreased over the following period (by 12% and 50%).<T3>Costs of Compliance.</T3> The equipment required for unloading operationsinvolving leaded ores include a portable skid-mounted sweeper at a costof $50,000 per unit [Ex. 577, p. 27]. One unit per stevedoring firm wouldbe required. Annualized capital costs (with an assumed useful life of twelveyears and cost of capital of 10 percent) are $7,340. Operation and maintenance(Oandamp;M) expenses, estimated at 10 percent of capital plus $1,500 forfilter replacement, would be $6,500. Payloader cab enclosures and filters, estimated to cost $5,000 per vehicle,would also be required [Ex. 686c, p. 33]. Two such vehicles would needto be equipped per firm [Ex. 577, p. 271. (This cost may be avoided bythose firms that rent payloaders). Annualized capital costs are $734 eachand Oandamp;M expenses would be $3,600 each. Total annual costs for theseenclosures are thus $4,334 per enclosure. The estimated cost of acquiring a retro-fit clamshell cover is $800 to$1,000. Lips for the clamshell can also be retro-fit at $2,500 to $3,000.Slurrying and pumping the final amounts of ore from the hold are optionsthat may be used in lieu of vacuum sweeping. Costs for this equipment areexpected to be approximately $1,000,000. Annualized costs would be $146,800and Oandamp;M costs will be $100,000 annually. Total annual costs for thisequipment are thus $246,800. Conveyors and chutes have been prescribed to reduce exposure during loading.Most stevedoring firms are believed to have conveyors, but not chutes.Capital costs for this item are assumed to be at most $1,000. Annual costsare expected to be negligible. Total costs per firm were estimated based on the following expenditures:for unloading operations, the vacuum sweeping equipment would be $50,000,along with two payloader enclosures at $5,000 each, and clamshell attachmentsat $4,000. Total costs for this equipment would be $64,000. For loadingoperations, it is expected that $1,000 will be expended for the chute usedin conjunction with a conveyor. Total capital costs per firm are thus $65,000.Annual costs for the sweeper and payloader enclosures total $22,508, basedon the calculations performed above. Annual costs for clamshell attachmentsand chutes are expected to be low, on the order of $600 (assuming a 20year useful life). Total annual cost per firm was thus estimated to be$23,108. Total annual industry costs are expected to be approximately $550,000 to$830,000. This figure is based on an estimate that 24 to 36 firms are unloadinglead ores (6 to 9 firms at each of 4 ports [Ex. 577, p. 11] with all firmscomplying fully). Should flexible intermodal bulk containers (FIBCs) be found feasible forlead ore transport, compliance costs would be virtually eliminated.<T3>Economic Feasibility. </T3>Based on information in the public recordOSHA believes that no costs will be incurred by the stevedoring industryin response to this rulemaking action. OSHA's reasoning is as follows:Under paragraph (e)(1) of the lead standard, any employer who can demonstratethat workers are exposed to lead in excess of 50 mg/m\3\ for 30 or fewerdays per year is permitted to use any combination of controls to achievethe PEL. Available data indicate that about 3 days (7 shifts) are requiredto unload a shipment of ore [Ex. 612, p. 2]; thus, a stevedoring firm wouldneed to unload 10 shipments per year for its employees to be exposed inexcess of the 30 day limit. Import data indicate that it is highly unlikelythat any one firm is handling such an abundance of ore, since only about30 shipments are received annually by the U.S. overall, on average, andthere are apparently a number of firms which handle ore in each port [Ex.577, pp. 11, 19]. Further, in the event that any individual firm were tofind itself in a position to handle such a large amount of the lead cargo,the lead standard allows administrative controls to ensure that no employeeis exposed in excess of 30 days per year. Even this strategy may not benecessary, however, as many jobs involving lead exposure apparently donot last a full shift [Ex. 612, p. 3] and the turnover rate in this industryis reported to be quite high [Ex. 577, p. 2].OSHA therefore concludes that the stevedoring industry will incur no costs,and hence, will experience no economic impact as a result of this action.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Impact Determinations.</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility DeterminationIn accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1664, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), OSHA has made an assessment of the impact of this rulemakingaction on small entities. As a result of this assessment, OSHA has determinedthat small entities in the nonferrous foundry industry could experiencesubstantial impact as a result of this rulemaking action. However, sincethe Agency has determined that achieving the 50 mg/m\3\ PEL by means ofengineering and work practice controls is economically infeasible for thenonferrous foundry industry, small foundries will face no adverse impactas a result of this rule.Environmental Impacts This rulemaking action has been reviewed in accordance with the requirementsof the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council onEnvironmental Quality NEPA regulations, and the Department of Labor's NEPAcompliance procedures and is not anticipated to have a significant impacton the external environment.For the nine industries in this remand proceeding, the recommended techniquesfor controlling employee exposure to airborne lead principally involvethe capture and containment of lead fume and dust. To comply with EPA andOSHA regulations, lead fume and dust are captured by ventilation systemsor suppressed by wet methods. The effect of the 50 mg/m\3\ PEL will beto increase the amount of lead currently being contained, either in theform dust ventilated to baghouse collection systems or lead-contaminatedsolutions. This increase was judged by OSHA to represent a small portionof all lead contaminated wastes currently being collected by any means.Thus, OSHA finds that there will be no significant environmental impactassociated with this rulemaking. To the extent that lead dust is beingprevented from entering ambient air and to the extent that wastes are disposedof in an environmentally acceptable manner, this regulation should providesome improvement of environmental quality.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
