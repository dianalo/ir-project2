Garcia</HL><DD> 06/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Weakness in the dollar continued to take its toll on the stock market, depressing prices in a quiet session yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average started off on a firm note, helped by a higher price and strong demand for International Business Machines shares after the computer company said Tuesday it expects record sales for its personal computers this year.    But by early afternoon, the industrial average sank into the minus column as profit-taking fed on the weaker dollar and lower bond prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 11.32 points at 2428.41.    The broader stock market indexes also lost ground. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.82 to 172.40, and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.57 to 306.86.    Volume on the Big Board contracted to 153.8 million shares from 194.2 million shares Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered gainers by 274 issues, 906 to 632.    Although the end of the quarter is fast approaching, traders said many of their institutional accounts don't seem to be in a big hurry to spend any cash they might have in their portfolios. &quot;People seem to have their minds on other matters, but not the stock market,&quot; said Kenneth Ducey, head of institutional equity sales at S.G. Warburg in New York.    Rather than spending cash, James Solloway, chief economist for Argus Research, believes investors might be pondering the next move in interest rates. He believes rates on the Treasury's 30-year bond, now at 8.45%, have settled into a higher range, between 8% and 9%. In 1986, these rates hovered between 7% and 8%.    Mr. Solloway said higher rates might be necessary to support the dollar and attract foreign investors; a somewhat stronger economy would also drive up rates as credit demands increased. He expects the economy to grow at a 4% rate this year.    Rates could drift down to 8.25% or lower, Mr. Solloway said, but he would anticipate rates would then move up from those levels. Even if rates were one percentage point higher in 12 months, he believes, the outlook for corporate earnings is bullish enough to drive stock prices higher.    Oil stocks were mostly lower, with Exxon off 3/8 to 90 7/8, Atlantic Richfield off 1 1/4 to 92 1/8, Amerada Hess off 1/4 to 36 3/8 and Chevron off 1/8 to 59 3/4. Traders generally believe that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna, Austria, today, probably will agree to maintain crude oil prices at $18 a barrel.    Occidental Petroleum bucked the trend in the oil patch, moving up 1 1/4 to 39 on trading of more than 1.6 million shares. Eugene Nowak, an oil industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock.    He believes that Occidental, which owns Midcon pipeline, will benefit from Tuesday's federal appeals court ruling that ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change or justify two key aspects of its rule that requires pipelines to carry gas for anyone, unless the pipeline ships only its own gas. The ruling could lessen pipeline companies' exposure to &quot;take-or-pay contracts,&quot; which require them to pay producers for large quantities of gas regardless of whether they can sell the gas.    Some other pipeline stocks also advanced. Panhandle Eastern rose 3/4 to 32 1/8 and Sonat rose 1 1/4 to 35 5/8. But Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline fell 7/8 to 35 1/8.    Lorimar-Telepictures fell 1 1/4 to 16. The company announced a buyback program for as much as 15% of common shares and a restructuring to focus on its core entertainment production and distribution businesses. But the company also said it will record a loss of $59 million for the year ended March 31.    Dayton Hudson tumbled 2 1/8 to 51 in active trading. The Minneapolis-based retailer has received an inquiry from the Haft family of Washington, which controls Dart Group, about acquiring the company. Meanwhile, the Minnesota legislature is considering anti-takeover legislation.    Hanson Trust rose 5/8 to 14 1/4 on trading of more than 3.4 million American depositary receipts. Hanson said the activity was fueled by the removal of a large seller from the London market, where a block of 45 million shares, equal to nine million ADRs, changed hands. The seller &quot;created a psychological drag on the market,&quot; Hanson said.    In London and New York, the seller was rumored to be the Kuwait Investment Authority. The U.S. representative for the investment authority couldn't be reached.    Some early gains in IBM gave the stock market a lift, despite the weaker dollar and bond prices. IBM rose 1 1/4 to 166 1/8 in heavy trading after moving up 1 5/8 Tuesday, when the company moved to dispel fears that sales of its new personal computers are lagging.    Not all other computer-related stocks followed IBM's lead. Digital Equipment fell 1 5/8 to 169, Unisys rose 2 to 124 1/4, NCR declined 1 to 76 1/4, Honeywell moved up 7/8 to 82 3/8 and Compaq Computer added 7/8 to 43 3/4. In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer advanced 3/4 to 42, Microsoft gained 2 to 104 3/4 and Lotus Development was unchanged at 30 1/2.    Rusty Pelican Restaurants jumped 1 1/2 to 8 1/2 in the OTC market. Management of the restaurant company is backing a $9-a-share offer from Vicorp Specialty Restaurants, a closely held San Diego company.    Kinder-Care rose 1 to 17 1/2 in OTC trading on news that it plans to split the company into two separate public companies, with one focusing on day-care and educational operations and the other on financial services.    Sylvan Learning gained 2 to 11. KinderCare plans to acquire Sylvan to add to its educational segment. American Savings andamp; Loan Association of Florida rose 1 3/8 to 15 1/2. Kinder-Care agreed to acquire the thrift for $17 a share in a transaction totaling $138 million.    Par Pharmaceuticals gained 3/4 to 26. The company got Food and Drug Administration approval to manufacture and market the generic equivalents of two analgesic products of Riker Laboratories.    Penwest closed up 1 at 46 after trading as high as 47 1/2. The company declared a 2-for-1 stock split. </TEXT></DOC>
