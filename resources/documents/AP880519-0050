Parry called for tougher enforcement of anti-littering laws. Thelaw permits fines of more than $700 for littering, but in 1986, theaverage fine imposed was less than $60.   Parry also suggested hiring wardens to ticket litterers, muchlike meter maids ticket parking violators, and producing a ``blackbook'' illustrating a community's litterers or even awarding a``booby prize'' to the worst.   A major soccer match can pile up 5 tons of garbage in and arounda stadium and on an average week, commuters leave 25 tons ofrubbish behind in the London Underground subway system, said GrahamAshworth director-general of the group.</TEXT></DOC>
