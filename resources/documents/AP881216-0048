(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker proclaimed hisinnocence after a federal magistrate set a $50,000 bond for him andthree former aides accused of bilking $4 million from his TVministry's flock.   ``Basically, to be very, very honest, it's a sad day for me,''Bakker said after Thursday's hearing. ``Here at Christmastime, it'ssad for my family, my children and my friends. But we have a goodGod and I have wonderful attorneys standing by my side.''   Bakker, 48, arrived at the federal courthouse in a whiteCadillac, smiling and waving to reporters.   After the 30-minute hearing, he said, ``I am not guilty of thesecharges and I'm looking forward to due process taking place. If Iget a fair trial, we can win this case.''   His wife, Tammy, did not accompany him.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor continued an arraignment for Bakkerand co-defendant Richard Dortch until Jan. 17, when both men willenter pleas and a trial date will be set.   Taylor set bonds of $50,000 apiece for Bakker, Dortch andbrothers James and David Taggart.   Taylor ordered Bakker to remain in South Carolina and the court'swestern North Carolina district. Dortch was restricted to NorthCarolina and Florida, where he lives.   Bakker did get some good news. Assistant U.S. Attorney JerryMiller said no additional charges were planned against Bakker andDortch.   Bakker, Dortch, and the Taggarts were indicted Dec. 5 after a16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operationsunder Bakker's leadership.   Dortch is Bakker's former top deputy. David Taggart is Bakker'sformer personal aide, and James Taggart is PTL's former interiordecorator.   Bakker and Dortch are charged with mail fraud and wire fraud.They also are accused of conspiring to defraud ministry contributorsto support extravagant lifestyles and of diverting more than $4million in PTL money for their personal benefit.   Bakker's only comments in court were to respond ``yes, sir'' whenTaylor asked if he understood the charges.   The Taggarts pleaded innocent to charges of tax evasion andconspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection. They are accused ofusing more than $1.1 million in PTL money for personal expenditures.   Taylor tentatively scheduled the Taggarts' trial for the lastweek of January. The Taggarts' attorney, Ben Cotten, said heexpected to request a continuance, and Taylor said it likely wouldbe granted.   George T. Davis, Bakker's chief counsel, said the case hadbroader implications.   ``Bakker is not the only one on trial,'' Davis said after thehearing. ``His wife is on trial and the whole ministry _ theelectronic ministry _ is on trial. ''   At a news conference, Dortch indicated he might seek a separatetrial.   ``Probably the question we're asked most repeatedly is: `Am Itrying to separate myself from Jim and Tammy Bakker?''' he said. ``Imust stand on my own statements, not those of others, on myintentions, not the intentions of others.''   The Taggart brothers declined to comment.   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 in a sex-and-hushmoney scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. Threemonths later, PTL filed for bankruptcy protection.   On Tuesday, Toronto real estate magnate Stephen Mernick boughtthe assets of PTL for $65 million at a hearing before U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia, S.C.</TEXT></DOC>
