Robert G. Petersdorf, president of the association, said that in1978 it was feared that the Bakke decision, which forbids the useof special consideration in the admission of minorities, wouldcause medical schools to enroll even fewer minorities than before.   ``The opposite proved to be true,'' Petersdorf said.   In the first enrollment period after the Bakke decision, 40.9percent of the minority students who applied to medical schoolswere admitted, and minority enrollees composed 8.7 percent offirst-year medical school classes.   Ten years later, Petersdorf said, the medical schools areadmitting 51.7 percent of the minority applicants and they nowrepresent 10.2 percent of the entering classes.   ``The Supreme Court decision actually encouraged affirmativeaction goals by allowing the use of race and other determinants inaddition to academic achievement as acceptable admissionscriteria,'' Petersdorf said.   He said that medical schools began affirmative action steps in1970 and the Bakke decision ``reaffirmed'' them.</TEXT></DOC>
