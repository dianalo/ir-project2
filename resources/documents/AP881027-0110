Only a tiny fraction of the country's 26 million blacks voted inWednesday's segregated elections, which the white governmentdescribed as the most significant extension of democracy in SouthAfrican history. An estimated one third of 1.5 million registeredblacks came to the polls.   ``Manipulate statistics whichever way you like,'' said Tutu, whoadvocated an election boycott. ``The reality remains that blackSouth Africans reject apartheid and government attempts to give it acoat of new paint,'' said the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the predominant blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate muncipal councils, schools and health services.   The far-right Conservative Party, campaigning for stricterenforcement of apartheid laws, had predicted victory in Pretoria,the country's administrative capital. It narrowly missed its goal,winning 19 council seats to 22 for the Nationalists.   It also fell short of its targets in the Orange Free State, themost rural of four provinces.   But the Conservatives swept to power in farming and industrialtowns of Transvaal, the most populous province, where they won atleast 67 of 105 municipalities.   The Nationalists for the first time gained outright control inJohannesburg, the nation's largest city, but the Conservatives alsowon seats on the council for the first time.   Both the Conservatives and Nationalists said the results bodedwell for their prospects in a general election, expected by early1990.   These were the first nationwide municipal elections contested bythe Conservative Party, which was established in 1980 bydisenchanted Nationalists.   The elections also were the first in which South Africans of allraces voted on the same day. A total of 7,229 seats were contested,most of them in white communities. Of the 1,839 seats available onblack councils, only 905 had more than one candidate.   The white government declared itself satisfied with black turnoutand said some of the elected blacks might be asked to negotiate onnational issues. Blacks normally have no say at the national level.   ``A significant percentage (of blacks) voted for peacefulevolutionary change,'' said Constitutional Development MinisterChris Heunis.   State-run Radio South Africa estimated the black voter turnout atabout one-third nationwide. That would mean over 400,000 blacks castvotes, compared to just under 300,000 in the last black municipalelections in 1983.   However, the population increased about 15 percent since then,indicating only a minimal increase in black voter turnout.   The black tournout ranged as high as 80 percent in some smallrural towns, but it was 11.5 percent in Soweto, the largest blackcommunity.   In many townships, there were no candidates or the number ofblacks eligible to vote was so low that the voting represented onlya fraction of the population. In Soweto, the votes cast represented2.8 percent of adult residents.   ``I see they (the government) are claiming today that hundreds ofthousands have voted and that the people elected have a solidmandate,'' Tutu said at today's news conference. ``How can there bea solid mandate when half the seats for blacks were not evencontested for the lack of interest? How does a 10 or 12 percentagepoll in Soweto constitute a solid mandate?''   Government-run television said 25 percent of black registeredvoters in Cape province cast ballots, 33 percent in Transvaal, 46percent in the Orange Free State and 29 percent in Natal.   Anti-apartheid activists, including many prominent clergymen,said voting for separate local authorities represents anentrenchment of the system of racial segregation.   In the white elections, anti-apartheid candidates kept control ofDurban.</TEXT></DOC>
