Any method of extracting the performance curveshould consider the data in each of these domains carefully, This paperconcentrates on the use of the method of bins technique of performancedata analysis. Typical experimental data is used for illustration. Themethod of bins takes performance data and divides the windspeed axisinto a number of class intervals. In each interval, the average of thewindspeed is measured and plotted. A lack of correlation between windspeedand power measurements that are taken simultaneously using relativelyshort sampling intervals is shown. A method of getting around the problemof data scattering is to numerically filter out the turbulent componentsof windspeed. Examples are used to show how this method decreases thestandard deviation of windspeed and power data. Another aspect of testingwind turbines using the method of bins is the nonlinearity of the trueperformance curve of the wind turbine. In regions of performance curvenonlinearity, the estimated performance curve is shown to deviate fromthe true performance curve as evidenced by simulation results. This deviationis shown to be not only a function of the square of the turbulence intensity,but also a function of the nonlinearity of the performance curve andthe frequency response of the turbine. The actual energy produced bythe wind energy system is independent of the averaging interval usedwhen reducing power and windspeed performance data. 23 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
