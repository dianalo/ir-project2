Dukakis had to do well, and I thinkthis will clearly be the opportunity Michael Dukakis lost,'' Sen.Alfonse D'Amato said in New York. ``The vice president has fendedhim off.''   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, interviewed at Wake ForestUniversity in Winston-Salem, N.C., where the debate was held, said:``The moments of spontaneity were what distinguished MichaelDukakis tonight. ... The real winner was the American people, butMichael Dukakis outperformed George Bush tonight.''   Former presidential-primary rivals of the two nominees alsopicked winners along party lines.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``Dukakis won decisively interms of picking up political support. He came across as assured,confident and clear on the facts. ... Bush seemed befuddled andconfused.''   But Sen. Bob Dole, the top-ranking Republican in the Senate aswell as a former presidential candidate, said, ``George Bush had amission and he can say mission accomplished. He documented againand again that Mike Dukakis is a Ted Kennedy Massachusetts liberal_ and that means someone who's out of step with mainstreamAmerica.''   Pat Robertson, the former television evangelist defeated by Bushlast spring, said, ``On the important issues of taxation, strongdefense and law and order, George Bush was a clear winner.''   Minnesota State Auditor Arne Carlson, the highest-rankingRepublican in that state, said neither candidate lost ground since``nobody made a mistake, nobody offended anyone.''   But other elected officials were not shy about declaring theirparty's standard-bearer the victor.   Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said in a statementreleased by his office,. ``Governor Dukakis clearly advanced hiscampaign dramatically. He appeared knowledgeable, decisive, cool,presidential. He won.''   Another prominent Democrat, Ann Richards, the Texas statetreasurer and keynote speaker at the Democratic convention lastJuly, claimed similarly that Dukakis ``looked presidential.'' Sheadded, ``I thought Bush visibly lost his temper, which is a no-noin a debate.''   However, fellow Texan Phil Gramm, a Republican senator, said,``I believe that George Bush came across as more personable, morelikable. I thought Dukakis was especially weak on foreign policyand defense. ... I believe George Bush did what he had to do to winthe election. He came across as being more of a leader and more ofa real person.''   Another Republican senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah, said bothcandidates did well in the debate, ``but in my opinion Bush reallylaid him out and for the first time he really branded Dukakis asthe liberal he really is.''   Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader in theSenate, said, ``Tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was MichaelDukakis. I think the polls will show that the American peoplethought the same way.''   Some non-officeholders based their analysis on style.   ``Both of them were obviously very well coached,'' saidpsychologist Joyce Brothers. ``Dukakis' use of hands was better. Ihad much more of a sense of relaxation from Bush and that is aplus. I think it was a very close debate.''   ``Dukakis did much better when the camera caught himaccidentally. He is the master of the ironic smile,'' she said.``Bush was caught making notes, like a professor. That's a minus.But Bush is the better master of the pause. Dukakis licks his lipstoo much, which is a minus.''   Lillian Glass, a speech consultant who is author of ``Talk toWin,'' said Dukakis ``came across a lot weaker than Bush.''   ``Bush looks presidential, but he needs to hold his head upstraighter,'' she said. ``He made impressive recovery when he madean error. It made a big difference for him to drop his voice. Thewimp factor is finally gone.''   Not all observers wanted emotion.   ``I think there's too much emotion and passion in politics andwhat we need is more rationality and articulateness,'' said Sen.Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. It was Dukakis, he said, whose answers``were the most articulate and in-depth.''   At the same time, Pell said ``I thought the whole debate waspretty mundane.''   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, another Democrat,agreed, ``It was rather boring.'' Still, he said, Dukakisdemonstrated ``that he was equal if not superior to Mr. Bush ondefense and he was clearly superior on domestic programs.''   But Delaware Gov. Michael Castle, chairman of the RepublicanGovernors' Association, said Bush came off as ``more caring.''   ``Clearly Mike Dukakis was painted as being even more liberalthan the Bush campaign has been painting him so far,'' said Castle,at the Southern Governors' Conference in Sea Island, Ga.   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, another Republican at the conference,said Bush ``held the advantage he had going into the debate.'' Hesaid Dukakis ``had to go there and slay a dragon, and clearly hedidn't.''   Two Democrats at the Sea Island conference saw it differently.   ``The first round was won by Governor Dukakis. It was not aknockout but clearly in my judgment a sound decision,'' saidVirginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles. ``Dukakis was more in command ofthe facts, more articulate ... and looked presidential.''   Gov. Ned McWherter, D-Tenn., said Dukakis ``showed the Americanpeople that he can hold his footing with George Bush _ after allGeorge Bush is vice president of the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
