The Democratic-controlled panel on Thursday endorsed the bill bya 34-14 vote, largely along party lines. The measure would escalatethe economic pressure imposed two years ago when Congress passed alimited sanctions law over President Reagan's veto.   A similar bill had been approved May 3 by the House ForeignAffairs Committee, and the legislation still must be considered byseveral other House panels before being sent to the full House fora vote.   The bill would force a virtual cutoff of U.S. economic ties toSouth Africa, forcing divestiture of U.S. investments within a yearand prohibiting most exports and imports. It also would tightenrestrictions on U.S. lending to South African companies and wouldban U.S. military and intelligence cooperation with Pretoria.   Approval came after the panel narrowly adopted, 27-24, anamendment offered by an opponent of the legislation, Rep. BillMcCollum, R-Fla., that would have the effect of making it eventougher, but at the same time more difficult for Congress to pass.   The amendment would have extended South African importprohibitions to include not only products from that country, butproducts from other countries which contain components or partsmade in South Africa. The provision would affect many itemscontaining industrial diamonds, among other products.   McCollum argued that the move would prevent other countries fromstepping in to snap up the share of trade given up by the UnitedStates. But opponents said the provision would be impossible toenforce because of the difficulty of tracing the origin of itemslike diamonds.   ``This is an effort to kill the bill with pseudo-kindness,''said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.   In 1986, the latest year for which figures were available, U.S.direct and indirect investment in South Africa totaled an estimated$4 billion. Total bilateral trade for that year was roughly $2billion. A recent congressional report noted that since 1984, 156U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa and another 157still have direct investments or employees there.   The Reagan administration is strongly opposed to thelegislation, preferring instead a policy of ``constructiveengagement.'' That policy calls for maintaining political andeconomic ties to South Africa in the belief that such ties give theUnited States more leverage to promote reforms in South Africa'ssystem of racial separatism.   Several members of the Banking Committee expressed concern thatU.S. banks would suffer from the increased lending restrictions,which would ban rescheduling of outstanding loans.   Chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., noted that there had been aflurry of lobbying against the measure by banking interests, whoargued they would be forced to sell off South African loans atdiscounts.   A primary sponsor of the sanctions bill, Foreign Affairs Africasubcommittee chairman Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., acknowledged therewould be some costs for a limited number of U.S. interests, andsaid some South Africans could realize short-term benefits.   ``I wish there were a way to add pressure without cost orinconvenience to American business,'' Wolpe said. ``But there is noway to do that.'' He said it is in the long-term best interests ofthe United States to avoid what he termed ``an evolving war''between the races in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
