<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0608 </DOCNO><TEXT>An optical remote sensor for temperature and pressure was constructedby affixing a ruby crystal to the tip of a single optical fiber. Thetemperature and pressure information is encoded onto the fluorescentsignal back-scattered from the fibertip. Such an optical system is immuneto electromagnetic noise. Changes in the lifetime of the emission areassociated only with changes in the temperature of the ruby crystal,while frequency shifts of the emission lines are associated with bothpressure and temperature changes. Measurements of frequency shifts andlifetime are not dependent on excitation beam intensity and/or lossesin the optical fiber. This system will operate reliably and accuratelyin hostile and adverse non-isothermal environments. The sensor is ableto measure pressure stresses at a minute point in a material with a resolutionof a few tenths of kilobars. The dynamic range is one megabar. The doubletspacing also indicates whether the stresses are hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic.However, one disadvantage of the ruby sensor is its relatively long lifetime(3 msec at 300{sup 0}K), limiting the time resolution of pressure wavefronts.Given the very favorable performance of the sensor, it would be significantimprovement to develop a chromium ion activated crystal having a muchfaster mean lifetime. 22 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
