(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Tuesdaythat a sharp decline in gaming income contributed to a 9 percentdrop in quarterly profits.   For the three months ending June 30, the hotel-casino concernearned $38.2 million, or 79 cents per share, compared with $42million, or 87 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.

Gaming income fell 21 percent to $29 million from$36.8 million.   Chairman Barron Hilton said results were mixed. In Chicago andNew York, one hotel did better while another declined. The HiltonHawaiian Village had excellent results, but the San FranciscoHilton still hasn't recovered business lost from last fall'searthquake, he said.   The Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas benefited from a guestroomtower addition, with room occupancy and income both up markedly.But results at the Las Vegas Hilton, the company's other propertyin Las Vegas, fell 56 percent.   ``The property had exceptional results in the 1989 period, andwe recognized the quarterly comparison would be further challengedby the increased competition in Las Vegas,'' Hilton said.   For the first six months, Hilton profits rose 15 percent, to$63.3 million, or $1.31 a share, from $55.1 million, or $1.14 ashare.
