The offer values Magnet's ordinary shares at 552.6 millionpounds ($939 million), or 300 pence ($5.10) each. The remainder ofthe total price is being offered to buy out the existing Magnetconvertible stock.   Shares in Magnet finished at 309 pence ($6.35) on London's StockExchange, up 20 pence (34 cents).   Meanwhile, Magnet stockholders are being offered new shares thatare convertible into stock of the buyout vehicle, known as DMWSL033 PLC.   Conversion of the new stock, which would amount to a 20-percentstake in DMWSL, would take place if the company is sold orrefloated on the stock market.   Magnet Chairman Tom Duxbury, who would take over as chairman andchief executive of DMWSL, has in recent years steered the companyfrom being a supplier to the building trade to being a retailer.   This change of strategic direction, coupled with an uncertainoutlook for British consumer spending in coming months, is expectedto have an adverse impact on the company's stock price in theshort- to medium-term, Duxbury said in a statement.   The cash portion of the buyout offer represents a 47-percentpremium over the Magnet share price of 204 pence ($3.47) just priorto the January announcement that a management buyout was beingconsidered.   Magnet had profit before tax of 57.5 million pounds ($98million) on revenue of 375.6 million pounds ($639 million) in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
