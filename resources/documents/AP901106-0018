Police identified the assailant as El Sayyid A. Nosair, 35,whose nationality was unknown. He was wounded by a postal policeofficer as they exchanged gunfire outside the Halloran House, saidChief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli.   The postal officer and a bystander in the hotel were alsowounded, police said.   Kahane, 58, a Brooklyn-born Israeli extremist who once served inthe Israeli parliament, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital,said hospital spokesman Peter Schectman.   Mayor David Dinkins said the shooting was ``an internationaltragedy that shocks all of us.''   Kahane was head of the anti-Arab Kach party in Israel. The partyadvocates the ouster of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory and aban on Jewish-Arab marriages. The movement's symbol is a clenchedfist inside a Star of David.   Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the UnitedStates in 1968 to mount armed responses to anti-Semitic acts. Thegroup organized classes in karate and weapons training and heldpatrols in high-crime neighborhoods.   Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of MajorAmerican-Jewish Organizations, called Kahane ``a highlycontroversial figure who had strong supporters and opponents.''   ``Whatever one thought about his political program, his shockingassassination will be deplored by friends and foes alike,'' hesaid.   Witnesses said Kahane had given a speech to about 60 people at ameeting of the Zionist Emergency Evacuation Rescue Organization.Shortly after 9 p.m., as Kahane answered questions from the podium,a gunman who sat through the speech stood up and fired twice at himfrom a distance of about 4 feet, Borrelli said. Kahane was hit oncein the neck.   The assailant ran from the room, bumping into a 73-year-old man,whom he shot in the leg, Borrelli said.   The gunman fled outside and tried to hijack a taxi, he said. Anon-duty postal officer outside a nearby post office intervened.They exchanged gunshots and both were wounded.   The officer was shot in the arm and the gunman was hit in thechin.   All were taken to Bellevue where the gunman was taken tosurgery, said hospital spokeswoman Karen Crowe. He was expected tosurvive. The officer's wound was superficial, she said. All werelisted in stable condition.   The gunman's nationality was unknown, and he apparently lived inNew Jersey, Borrelli said.   The hotel on Lexington Avenue is also called the New YorkMarriott East Side.   Kahane served as a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament,for four years but was barred from running for re-election in 1988after legislators passed a law banning parties that have a racistplatform.   In September, Kahane went on trial in Jerusalem on charges ofdisturbing public order for leading an anti-Arab rally after thestabbing deaths of two Israelis last year. Kahane was also chargedwith sedition for calling Arabs ``cancer spreading in our midsts''during a separate incident. Another hearing in the trial wasscheduled for December.   The sedition charge stems from a Kahane rally in Jerusalem onJuly 7, 1989, a day after a Palestinian from the occupied GazaStrip grabbed the wheel of an Israeli bus, plunging it into a steepravine on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Sixteen people werekilled in the attack.   ``Kill those who come to kill you,'' Kahane told the crowd. Hissupporters chanted ``Death to the Arabs!'' and waved signsdemanding that all Arabs be expelled from Israel and the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   Kahane moved to Israel in 1971 and became a citizen a yearlater. He renounced his American citizenship to run for Israel'sparliament.   Kahane conceded in a 1971 interview that the Jewish DefenseLeague's tactics were inspired by black militant groups.   ``Our point of view is that no anti-Semitism was ever created bya Jew who fought back,'' Kahane said.   He was born Martin David Kahane on Aug. 1, 1932, in the New YorkCity borough of Brooklyn. He began using the name Meir after hisordination as a rabbi in 1957.   Martin Cohen, an attorney and follower of Kahane who was atMonday's meeting, called Kahane a martyr.   ``He stood for every Jew who no longer wants to be kickedaround, for every Jew who remembers the Holocaust,'' Cohen said.``Many people believed he was an extremist, but he was a kind,gentle man who died for what he believed.''   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of AmericanHebrew Congregations, said he disagreed strongly with Kahane'spolitical philosophy.   ``I nevertheless deeply regret his violent end,'' Schindlersaid. ``He did not deserve to die by an assassin's bullet.''</TEXT></DOC>
