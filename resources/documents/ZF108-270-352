SAY .andP;  .  .  GET, READ, and PICTURE in your C programs andcreate and use input fields.andP;  This makes it easy to convert dBASEapplications and leverage your dBASE programming expertise.andM;C programmers will appreciate direct access to the C function callsassociated with the embedded display commands.andP;  In addition, Quadbaseincludes a programmer's toolbox, with facilities for creating pop-up menusand windows, dialog boxes, and obtaining and verifying user passwords.andP;  As ifthis weren't enough, the package includes Clipper-style user-definedfunctions for accessing the Quadbase engine from Clipper programs.andM;Included with Quadbase-SQL is dQuery, Version 3.0, a $195 interactive toolfor executing SQL and query-by-example (QBE) queries, as wel las writingreports against dBASE III Plus and Lotus 1-2-3 files.andP;  Version 3.0 featuresan improved user interface with pull-down menus, on-line help, and completesupport for SQL (including views).andP;  With dQuery, you can save and reuse SQLand QBE queries, and reports created with it can be run from an embedded SQLapplication.andM;The package also provides source code example programs and an excellent SQLprimer.andP;  But in general, it lacks some polish.andP;  There are no MAKE files forrecreating the example programs, and the documentation is not explicit aboutwhich versions of the C compiler and linker are supported.andP;  In addition, youcan only make large model programs; so executables can become quite large(280K for a simple program to open a table and look up records).andP;  Othersystems, like the Paradox Engine, can produce comparable programs in half thesize.andP;  And, dQuery desperately needs 43- and 50-line text-mode support.andM;But considering its ability to create LAN-compatible embedded SQLapplications without having to use an SQL server, Quadbase-SQL shines.andP;  Ifyou're ready to move to C while retaining dBASE File compatibility or need toadd a real SQL-based relational database engine to your C programs, look nofurther: Quadbase-SQL is the answer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
