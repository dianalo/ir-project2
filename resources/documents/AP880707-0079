The company, EGandamp;G Inc., will buy technological know-how andcomponents for developing a helium magnetometer used forgeophysical mapping and minerals exploration, said EGandamp;G Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer John M. Kucharski.   The technology will be provided by the China National GeologicalTechnology Development Import and Export Co., under the Ministry ofGeology and Mineral Resources.   ``This is the first time for the ministry to cooperate with anAmerican company to export technical products to the U.S.,'' saidVice-Minister Xia Guozhi.   EGandamp;G, a Massachusetts-based high technology company with an18-year history in China, previously had sold technology to China,but this is its first time on the buying end.   China has shared scientific and technological knowledge,especially in the areas of agriculture, with African countries. Itjust signed an agreement with Brazil to develop and launch twoscientific satellites in a joint venture.   The United States last fall briefly froze further liberalizationof high technology transfers to China to protest alleged sales ofChinese Silkworm missiles to Iran.   Bilateral trade last year reached $10.4 billion, according toU.S. statistics.   Under the six-year agreement, EGandamp;G will use Chinese know-how todevelop the helium magnetometer, which will be produced in theUnited States and sold on the international market. The instrumentcan be used on airborne, marine and portable land-based systems formapping the Earth's magnetic field.   EGandamp;G made no payments on the technology. Instead, the Chinesecompany will be paid on a royalty-basis. Neither side would revealthe amount.   Kucharski told reporters that sales of the magnetometer areexpected to exceed $10 million.   Bian Zhaohao, president of China National Geological TechnologyImport and Export Corp., said the amount of money his company willearn is small, but added that the significance of technologytransfer from China to the United States was far more importantthan the profits.   ``In this way, we would like to create various forms ofcooperation not only with the U.S. but with other countries aswell,'' he said, adding the agreement reflects China's policy ofencouraging transfers and cooperation with other countries in thedevelopment of technology.</TEXT></DOC>
