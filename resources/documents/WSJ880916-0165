Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FND </IN><TEXT>   Asset allocation, the latest fad in the mutual fund business, is many things to many people.    To Walter Williams, allocation manager for Devonshire Fund, it offers a chance to outperform the stock market, over time, with limited volatility.    To John Chandler, spokesman for Permanent Portfolio Fund, it's the best way to provide safety and a reasonable, if modest, return.    But to James H. Gipson, chairman of Pacific Financial Research Inc., a mutual fund investment adviser, it's an &quot;opportunity with a great future behind it.&quot;    Whatever it is, it has become popular with many mutual fund marketers. Since the stock market crash put a fright into individual investors almost a year ago, fund brokers have been trying to sell the idea of diversification, a tool long used by institutional investors.    The pitch, essentially, is this: You want to reduce your exposure to the stock market? Fine. Spread your bets among our bond funds, our international funds, our gold fund; or put your money in our asset-allocation fund, and we'll do the spreading for you.    The basic idea is an old one: Keep your eggs in more than one basket. So-called balanced funds have long divided their money between the stock and bond markets, shifting the relative weighting depending on which asset seemed a better buy.    Asset-allocation funds add another basket or two, and some, such as Blanchard Strategic Growth Fund and Devonshire Fund, employ specialized portfolio managers for each basket and a master &quot;allocation manager&quot; to handle the whole.    Narrowly defined, there are a dozen or so asset-allocation funds. Although most of those have been weak performers this year, that hasn't stopped others from trying to cash in on the term's new cachet. &quot;Everyone's running around trying to call themselves an allocation fund,&quot; says Don Phillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values, a mutual fund advisory service.    Even among the dozen or so funds, there are differences in approach. Most, such as Blanchard and Devonshire, shift portfolio weightings periodically, depending on which markets they expect to strengthen. But others, including the Permanent Portfolio and USAA Cornerstone funds, simply divide the money according to a set formula and don't tamper with the mix.    The variety of approaches helps explain the different convictions of their adherents. Permanent Portfolio's Mr. Chandler characterizes those active allocators as relying on a &quot;crystal ball&quot; to switch assets from one market to another. &quot;It's the same as speculating,&quot; he says.    Permanent Portfolio keeps 35% of its investors' money in U.S. Treasury bills and Treasury bonds; 20% in gold bullion; 15% in selected U.S. stocks; 15% in real-estate and natural-resource stocks; 10% in Swiss francs; and 5% in silver bullion. It's &quot;the kind of investment you'd have in addition to something that depended on forecasting or predicting,&quot; Mr. Chandler says. Besides, he says, &quot;a lot of people don't want any excitement in their investments.&quot;    Permanent Portfolio's performance has certainly been less than exciting. In the five-year period through June, the fund appreciated just 23%, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., compared with a 63% gain for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index.    Mr. Chandler says the fund has nevertheless protected its investors' buying power, and he likens it to an insurance policy: &quot;You don't regret buying the premium just because your house didn't burn down.&quot;    Others think they can do better. Blanchard Strategic Growth and Devonshire, for example, are betting heavily on foreign securities, because both see the dollar's recent strength as transitory.    Devonshire currently has more than 50% of its money in foreign securities and gold, according to Mr. Williams. Blanchard has 30% in foreign equities, 11% in foreign fixed-income securities, 8% in precious metals, 33% in cash and only 18% in U.S. equities.    So far this year, their results have been unimpressive. Blanchard, with $250 million in assets, had gained just 1% as of Sept. 8, compared with an 8% average for the 1,561 stock and bond funds surveyed by Lipper. Devonshire, which began operating about six months ago, was down 3.4%.    &quot;If you weight a little more heavily on the better performers, you should get a fairly consistent return in the 15% to 20% range without that much volatility,&quot; Devonshire's Mr. Williams says. But over the next three months or so, he says, he expects U.S. stock and bond markets to plunge and hopes only that Devonshire will finish the year with a modest gain.    Oppenheimer Asset Allocation Fund has been the best performer among the group this year, with a 12.7% gain as of Sept. 8. The fund has achieved that by reducing its stock holdings to 49% of the portfolio from 62% at the start of the year and increasing its bond holdings to 38.5% from 20%. Only 7% of the total is in foreign stocks.    Like most of the active allocators, Oppenheimer normally shifts its weightings only gradually.    The major no-load and low-load fund groups generally have encouraged investors to spread money among existing funds. But some, including Fidelity and Vanguard, are moving to set up separate allocation funds.    &quot;No matter how hard we try to get people to diversify, it's really a very laborious process,&quot; says Neal Litvack, vice president, marketing, at Fidelity. &quot;Some people would prefer to have it done for them&quot; through a single fund set up for that purpose. Fidelity also plans to start a service by year's end that will advise individual clients on how to tailor their portfolios.    Some longtime industry-watchers are skeptical that the asset allocators will be able to outperform many mutual funds. Although allocation funds were well positioned to survive the stock market's plunge late last year, &quot;in many ways, they've seen their best day,&quot; contends Mr. Phillips, the Mutual Fund Values editor.    &quot;I would rather go with a soundly managed equity portfolio with an experienced manager whose strategy I can understand,&quot; he says. Because the active asset-allocation funds generally have broad investment parameters and short histories, anyone investing in them &quot;is giving more power to the manager with less of a record,&quot; he says.    Pacific Financial's Mr. Gipson, writing on the subject in a recent report to holders of Clipper Fund (not an asset-allocation fund), also argues that the best time for asset-allocation strategies has passed.    Mr. Gipson writes, &quot;Asset allocation is unlikely to be an exception to one of the iron laws of money management: An investment technique soars to its zenith of popularity just as it falls to its nadir of utility.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
