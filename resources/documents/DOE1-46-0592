This method is applicable to several diffraction problemsincluding the diffraction of a plane wave at cylinders of ellipticaland rectangular cross section. Computations show that with adaptic colocationnot only the integral parameters of the solution (for example scatteringcross section), but also the field near the scatterer, converges.</TEXT></DOC>
