The closely held company said the portable unit, with a built-in disk drive and word-processing, calculator and telecommunications programs, will have a suggested retail price of $4,995.    Telesensory, one of three manufacturers of Braille computer products in the U.S., didn't estimate the number of units it expects to sell. But the company said there are as many as 40,000 blind persons world-wide with skill levels that make them potential customers for Braille computers or for kits, currently available, that convert certain standard personal computers to Braille use.    The Telesensory unit uses a standard six-key English Braille typewriter keyboard connected to a one-line, 10-inch-wide erasable screen. The screen produces touchable Braille letters that allow users to proofread the text as they type it, or to edit text stored in the computer's memory, the company said.    The computer also includes a software program that translates English Braille -- a shorthand form of writing -- to standard English for printing purposes. The program also translates standard English to Braille, allowing the user to have access to text and data from other computers or information services. </TEXT></DOC>
