Ross Perot, this time in Delaware chancery court.    Five holders from New York who own either GM or GM Class E shares or both and an Illinois company, Drexel Home Inc., were listed as co-plaintiffs in derivative actions on behalf of GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit and GM. In a derivative action, holders sue directors on behalf of a corporation. GM, like many U.S. companies, is incorporated in Delaware.    Also listed as defendants are Mr. Perot, although he resigned his seat on the GM board, and Morton Meyerson, Thomas Walter and William Gayden -- three former EDS officials whose GM Class E shares and contingency notes also were purchased in the buyout. GM paid Mr. Perot and the three men $742.8 million.    GM shareholders have filed at least two other lawsuits opposing the transaction, one in federal court in Detroit and another in New York Supreme Court.    The latest lawsuit asked the court to invalidate the buyout and to order that GM directors be held accountable for unspecified damages to GM and EDS. An attorneys conference with a judge is scheduled for today to hear the plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery and to set a date to hear the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the transaction.    A GM spokesman said the company hadn't seen the complaint, and therefore hadn't any comment.    The suit said directors &quot;viewed Perot's public criticisms of their management of GM as violation of GM's de facto corporate code, which posed a threat to their reputations, board room tranquility and their continued positions and remuneration.&quot;    The lawsuit also said Mr. Perot &quot;sold his silence and his office to (directors), and agreed to abandon EDS and his efforts to reform GM for an amount far exceeding the value of Class E stock and contingent notes which he conveyed to GM.&quot;    GM Class E shares don't represent an ownership position in GM or EDS, but give holders a right to dividends based on EDS's profit. </TEXT></DOC>
