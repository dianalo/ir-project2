Aldehydes which form highly stable bisulfite-aldehydeaddition compounds, however, could be utilized to remove SO{sub 2} fromflue gas emissions. Since hydroxyalkylsulfonic acid formation is reversible,aldehydes used in such a process are potentially recoverable for reuse.At least one patented flue gas desulfurization process employing thisscheme has been developed in which the aldehyde was glyoxylic acid, CHOCOOH.Despite the potential importance of these reactions in atmospheric waterdroplets and their application in desulfurization processes, the formationkinetics and thermodynamics are not well characterized. This study wasundertaken in order that they could both predict which adducts representpotentially important reservoirs for S(IV) in rain-, fog and cloud-water,and determine which aldehydes are most effective in removing SO{sub 2}from flue gases.</TEXT></DOC>
