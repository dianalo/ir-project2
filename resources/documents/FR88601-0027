Thereis no major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States_based enterprises to competewith foreign_based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, Mr.Vance L. Clark, Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration, has determinedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because, in terms of the total number of ruralcommunities, less than 100 will be affected annually.This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder number 10.417. For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 19115, June 24, 1983, thisprogram/activity is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment and in accordance wtih the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Housing Amendments of 1983 revised the Agency's authorizing statutesfor the Section 504 Rural Housing Loan and Grant program. The proposedregulation updates and incorporates those revisions to comply with thelaw and congressional intent.The statute changes authorize providing assistance to improve or modernizedwellings independent of the removal of hazards, and allows the Secretaryto determine the appropriate maximum amount of assistance available. Also,the requirement that the applicant be unable to qualify for a Section 502loan was deleted. Subsequently, the proposed regulation changes involveincreasing the total amount of assistance available, expanding loan purposesand broadening eligibility requirements.Other major changes and revisions include requiring credit reports, appraisals,property insurance, title clearance and loan closings when the loan amountis over $7500. Numerous definitions have been deleted, and unless otherwisespecified, are defined in 7 CFR Part 1944, Subpart A. Also, there is theaddition of a provision for a waiver of the amount of personal resourcesneeded, and the loan or grant purposes are expanded to include paymentof reasonable application packaging fees.While the entire regulation is rewritten and being published, many sectionsare not changed. The revised or added sections which effect program objectivesand intent are discussed in the following material.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>1. In andSection; 1944.451, loan objectives and purposes are expanded toallow for repairs to improve or modernize houses without the removal ofhealth or safety hazards.2. In andSection; 1194.453, numerous definitions are deleted and the termsused are defined in CFR Part 1944, Subpart A, unless otherwise specified.3. A provision is added in andSection; 1194.456 to allow a reasonable packagingfee as an authorized loan or grant purpose.4. In andSection; 1194.457, the total life-time assistance available forloans is increased from $7,500 to $15,000. Total grant assistance, however,remains at $5,000.5. In andSection; 1944.458, program eligibility requirements are broadenedby deleting the requirement that applicants be unable to obtain assistancethrough the Agency's Section 502 rural housing program and the requirementeased regarding the amount of personal resources needed to authorize waiverswehn applicants are experiencing unusually high medical expenses.6. As a result of the increased amount of loan assistance, requirementsare added for credit investigations (andSection; 1944.467(c)), appraisals(andSection; 1944.463(d)), property insurance (andSection; 1944.464(b)), titleclearance and loan closings (andSection; 1944.463).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1944</ITAG>Aged, Grant programs_Housing and community development, Loan programs_Housingand community development.For reasons set out in the preamble, FmHA proposes to amend Chapter XVIII,Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1944_HOUSING</ITAG>1.
