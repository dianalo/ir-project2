Taxpayersacross the country are being stuck with the tab for aspeculative construction boom in the sunbelt. Southwesternerstrying to distract attention from this aspect of the scandalhave been looking northward in search of a scapegoat. Theirgaze has focused upon Wall Street brokers and their clients.   It is claimed that the major beneficiaries of the scandalare wealthy investors from across the nation who sought highinterest rates from high-flying southwestern thrifts with theassistance of Wall Street brokers. Unfortunately, this notionseems to have become the conventional wisdom without seriousexamination.</LP><TEXT>   While there is anecdotal evidence of thrifts that haverelied heavily on brokered deposits, the importance of suchdeposits has been greatly exaggerated. In December 1989,brokered deposits comprised only 7% of thrift depositsnationwide, and only 9% of deposits in Texas, where the vastmajority of thrift failures have been concentrated. There isno evidence to support the claim that a majority of depositsin insolvent southwestern thrifts came from other regions.   But the location of the depositors is actually beside thepoint. The important question in determining whether atransfer of wealth is occurring is not where the depositorslive, but where their money was invested. The deregulation ofthe nation's thrift industry started out as an effort toreduce the role of government in the market place. It endedup as the largest regional economic development program inU.S. history.   The 1980s were a period of hostility to traditionalfederal economic development programs. It was claimed thatsuch programs &quot;distorted the marketplace&quot; and should be theresponsibility of the private sector and state and localgovernment. Many programs important to the northeast andmidwest were severely reduced or eliminated. These includedUrban Development Action Grants, Community Development BlockGrants, EPA wastewater treatment grants and Urban MassTransit Administration programs.   This disdain for federal involvement in the market placecurtailed federal economic development activities in thenortheast and midwest at the same time as disdain forgovernment actually spurred economic activity in thesouthwest. When the federal government loosened regulationson federally chartered thrifts, the state of Texas went evenfurther.   Few people realize that we have a &quot;dual banking system&quot;based upon a federal state partnership with states regulatingstate chartered thrifts, while the federal governmentprovides deposit insurance. Unfortunately, in recent yearsthis federal state partnership was badly abused by stateregulators in Texas (and other states) who gave owners ofstate regulated thrifts free rein to engage in highly riskyactivities with funds backed by federal deposit insurance.Many state chartered thrifts were acquired by developers whoused them as private banks to finance the development ofoffice buildings, shopping centers and apartment complexes.   These thrifts attracted deposits like a magnet by offeringthe highest interest rates in the nation. From 1980 to 1985,federally insured deposits in state-chartered Texas thriftsgrew by a staggering 186 percent. But these thriftowner/developers did not worry about the risk associated withtheir ventures. When the bottom fell out of the Texas economyin 1986, taxpayers across the country were left holding thebag. And Texas was left with the property.   The magnitude of this regional economic developmentprogram can be illustrated by looking at the inventory ofproperty held by the Resolution Trust Corporation. In March1990, the RTC held $15 billion worth of repossessed property.Of that, $10.2 billion, or 68%, was located in the state ofTexas.   What does this mean for the future? A recent CommerceDepartment report concluded that the southwest will be thefastest growing region in the nation in the 1990s. While thisglut of property is currently dampening real estate values,it will stimulate growth in the years ahead. During therecent economic summit in Houston, the city pulled out allstops to convince the international press that Houston was anexcellent place for investment. One of their major sellingpoints: low-cost office space.   The costs to date to clean up state chartered thrifts inTexas are staggering. Since the bail-out began in 1988, $29billion in costs have resulted from insolvent state charteredthrifts across the nation. The 18 states of theNortheast-Midwest region caused only $1.3 billion, or 5%, ofthat $29 billion. Some $21 billion, or 72%, is due toinsolvent state-chartered thrifts in Texas.   The northeast and midwest regions are being hit with atriple whammy. First, although the northern states haverigorously regulated their state-chartered thrifts, they arebeing stuck with billions of dollars in costs from a statethat did not. Second, the enormous cost of this scandal willreduce the federal government's flexibility to make muchneeded investments in economic development in the northeastand midwest. Third, northern taxpayers have financed billionsof dollars worth of development in an area with which theirstates will compete for private investment for years to come.   Some people may not want to call it a transfer of wealth,but it comes down to this: through state policy, Texasencouraged a massive construction boom and -- by abusing thefederal deposit insurance system -- has levied a tax on ourcitizens to pay for it. If that isn't a transfer of wealth,we don't know what is. To point the finger at Wall Street isa feeble attempt to obscure this fact.   ---   Rep. Wolpe (D., Mich.) and Rep.
