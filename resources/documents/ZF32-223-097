(Printed Circuitboard)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Thryft, Ann R.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The demand for complex printed circuit boards (PCB) with finerlines and tighter line spacing is driving the cost of PCBs.andP;  Theaverage PCB of today is much smaller, compact and multilayeredthan those of yesteryears.andP;  High-end microcomputers use 4-layerswhile the average workstation goes from 6 to about 12 layers.andP;  Thecomplex board designs of today's systems require multiple-layeredboards with hole diameters under 10 mils and fine line circuitswith line widths and spacing to 5 mils and below.andP;  Manufacturersare using costly materials with better dimensional stability andlower dielectric constant to meet the complex designs of theseboards.andP;  Eight layer boards are not uncommon in CPU's such as the80386 and 40486.andP;  Although the use of surface-mount and fine-linetechnologies can reduce the amount of layers per board, an averagecircuit board of today consists of multiple layers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Circuit DesignIncreasing CostsSurface-Mount TechnologyTrendsPriceDemand.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographgraph.andO;Caption:   PCB price trends.
