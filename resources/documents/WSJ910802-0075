A Sony spokeswoman said the company received a requestearlier this year from Apple to build the PCs. She wouldn'tsay whether it would be a laptop or notebook-sized machine,or give any further details of the arrangement, referring allfurther questions to Apple.</LP><TEXT>   An Apple spokeswoman in Tokyo wouldn't comment on theagreement, which was reported in Nihon Keizai Shimbun,Japan's leading business newspaper.   The agreement stems from a longstanding relationshipbetween the two companies, with Sony supplying manycomponents for other Apple machines. Apple apparently wantsto tap into Sony's strength in miniaturization, which hascreated other hit consumer electronic products such as theWalkman.   The move seems to mark a further shift by Apple away fromits traditional strategy of building personal computers basedon its exclusive architecture stressing graphics. Recently,Apple announced it would cooperate with rival InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. to blend their PC systems. It isn'tclear how an Apple-Sony relationship would affect or fit into the Apple-IBM alliance. IBM has been aggressive in formingcooperative ventures with other American technology companiesin order to counteract growing Japanese strength in thefield.   While Apple's personal computer sales have risen sharplyas a result of its low-priced strategy unveiled last fall, ithas been hurt by the lack of a successful laptop ornotebook-sized computer, the fastest growing segment in thePC business. Japanese companies, such as Toshiba Corp. andNEC Corp., currently dominate that field.   The move also will give a boost to Sony, which has only aminor presence in the personal computer business.   Apple follows other American PC makers, which have alsoturned to the Japanese to help with laptop and notebookmodels. Compaq Computer Corp. works with Citizen Watch Co.,Texas Instruments Inc. has an agreement with Sharp Corp., andIBM's notebook computers, currently on sale only in Japan,are made by Ricoh Corp. IBM also recently decided to shiftproduction of all its small PCs to its Japan subsidiary, andit gets flat-panel displays, considered crucial for laptops,from its joint venture with Toshiba.</TEXT></DOC>
