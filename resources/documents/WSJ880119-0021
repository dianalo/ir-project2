Clark, a lawyer found guilty of embezzling client money involving an insider-trading scheme using Wall Street Journal stories in 1983 and 1984, died last Saturday.    He had been scheduled to be sentenced in Manhattan in less than a week.    Mr. Clark, 38 years old, was stricken alongside the pool at his mother's home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He died of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, according to Carl H. Loewenson Jr., an assistant U.S. attorney and lead prosecutor in the case tried in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.    The medical examiner's report noted that Mr. Clark suffered from chronic alcoholism, according to an investigator in the Broward County Medical Examiner's office. Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis is most often associated with alcoholism.    &quot;It's a tragic end to a tragic and bizarre story,&quot; Mr. Loewenson said.    Mr. Clark's attorney, criminal defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey, said: &quot;I don't think you can chalk this up to despondency.&quot; He noted that Mr. Clark was encouraged by results of a recent polygraph test Mr. Bailey hoped to use in a planned appeal.    Still, Mr. Bailey said he believes &quot;the pressure (from the case) was a contributing factor.&quot; Mr. Clark's private pressures apparently escalated along with his public problems. Mr. Bailey said Mr. Clark's divorce became final last week around the same time his Long Island home was sold. He said Mr. Clark had planned to use proceeds from the sale to fund his appeal, but the money became entangled in other legal proceedings.    Mr. Clark, a former partner in the New York law firm of Appleton, Rice andamp; Perrin, was found guilty last November of embezzling about $3.7 million from clients to invest in stocks. He was convicted of fraud, tax evasion and lying to regulators about the conspiracy in the first jury trial for any participant in the scheme, which began unraveling in 1984.    Mr. Clark was found to have shared in profits from stock trades made through Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. accounts, where he was a longtime client of former Kidder broker Peter Brant. Mr. Brant received advance information about the timing and contents of Heard on the Street columns from a former Journal reporter, R. Foster Winans. The money controlled by Mr. Clark was used to trade in stocks mentioned in the columns.    Mr. Brant pleaded guilty in 1984 to two counts of securities fraud and was the government's star witness against Mr. Clark and Mr. Winans, who was convicted of mail, wire and securities fraud in the scheme.    Last September, prosecutors dropped 38 insider-trading counts against Mr. Clark in order to expedite a trial on the other charges. His initial sentencing date was postponed until this Friday.    Because Mr. Clark's death preceded the sentencing, Mr. Bailey said, &quot;he dies without a conviction,&quot; which is technically recorded following sentencing.    &quot;It's true, no judgment of conviction will be entered,&quot; said Mr. Loewenson, the assistant U.S. attorney. &quot;But there is a jury verdict,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
