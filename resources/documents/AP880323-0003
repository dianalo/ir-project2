The network has finished first 26 times, including sixconsecutive years until NBC broke its streak in 1985-86, the firsttime NBC had won a season in three decades.   Times change. Now NBC is predicting it will win this season bythe widest margin ever.   CBS is barely behind ABC in season-to-date ratings, the numbersthat networks and advertisers use as a basis for negotiatingadvertising rates. The margin may be small, but last place is stilla blow to prestige. At least for CBS it leads the two othernetworks in evening news ratings.   After the 26th weeks of the season, NBC led the three networkswith an average prime-time rating of 16.3, ABC had a 13.9, and CBSa 13.6. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 millionhouseholds with televisions. CBS would have to beat ABC by justunder two points each of the remaining four weeks to tie for secondplace. That is unlikely. Last week, for instance, CBS edged ABC forsecond, but only by a third of a point.   CBS' regular series lineup is higher rated on average, but ABCwon the two weeks it had the Winter Olympics in prime time, and CBSconceded it would finish last when a slew of new comedies failed tomake a dent in the ratings last week.   Of the new shows, ``Trial and Error'' finished second-to-last inthe 77 Nielsen rankings, a reprise of ``My Sister Sam'' wasthird-to-last and ``Coming of Age'' ranked 59th. ``Eisenhower andamp;Lutz,'' added to the already strong Monday lineup, ranked 31st.   CBS has been struggling to draw younger viewers. Itshighest-rated shows are the venerable newsmagazine ``60 Minutes''and the long-running ``Murder, She Wrote,'' both on Sunday.   Of its shows that are new this season, CBS can count only Fridaynight's ``Beauty and the Beast'' as a ratings success. Other newCBS shows, like ``Frank's Place,'' ``Tour of Duty'' and``Wiseguy,'' have drawn critical praise but have not found asizable audience.   The executive responsible for the 1987-1988 season schedule,former CBS Entertainment President B. Donald Grant, departed thenetwork in mid-season and was replaced by Kim LeMasters, who won'treally make his mark on the network's schedule until next season.   Look for a major revamping of the CBS lineup next fall with newcomedies due from GTG Entertainment, the production company offormer MTM Production chief and former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker,who has an exclusive deal with CBS. CBS also will have Mary TylerMoore back in a comedy and another new show will feature herone-time sitcom co-star Dick Van Dyke.</TEXT></DOC>
