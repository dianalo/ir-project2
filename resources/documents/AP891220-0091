The missing documents detail Kenneth Weiner's involvement withthe fund, Executive Deputy Chief James Bannon said Tuesday.   ``He's gone. The records are gone. ... He was last known to bethe custodian'' of most of the documents, Bannon said.   Police Chief William Hart has said Weiner, a former civiliandeputy police chief, stole from the fund, which finances undercoveroperations of the narcotics division.   Weiner was in charge of sensitive security work for the policefrom 1980 to 1986. He resigned in 1986 after an investigation intoa precious-metals investments deal in which several Detroit-areainvestors lost several thousand dollars.   Weiner has not been seen or heard from publicly since thefederal and city investigations began several weeks ago. The FBIhas refused to discuss the scope or any other details of itsinvestigation into the fund.   The FBI and U.S. attorney's office are trying to determinewhether Weiner diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from thefund for personal use.   Bannon said a substantial number of documents were gone,including some subpoenaed under federal and city orders. He said atheft report was filed.   The City Council subpoenaed financial records from 1985 to 1987,and city auditors began examining documents Tuesday.   Release of the records averted a court battle between MayorColeman Young and the council, which had issued a subpoenademanding a chance to review the records.   ``The mayor's concern all along was to protect the integrity ofthe grand jury process and the integrity of the secret servicefund,'' said spokesman Bob Berg.   Young, who initially said he never would give the documents tocity auditors and the council, refused to say why he changed hismind.</TEXT></DOC>
