SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sony Corp. and Warner Bros. have reached atentative agreement to avoid a looming court battle over Hollywoodfilm producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters, it was reported today.   The possible settlement would allow Guber and Peters, producersof such films as ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man'' to break theirfive-year contract with Warner Bros. to head Columbia PicturesEntertainment, which Sony is buying, according to publishedreports, which cited unidentified sources.   A court hearing was scheduled for Thursday to hear Warner'srequest for an injunction barring Guber and Peters from``reneging'' on the Warner Bros. contract they signed this year.   But Tuesday, Sony, Warner and Guber-Peters Entertainment issueda brief statement saying they had asked for the hearing to bedelayed for an indefinite time ``to allow the parties to havefurther discussions.''   To settle the dispute, Warner would receive about 35 percent ofthe 150-acre Burbank Studios in exchange for the Lorimar studio lotin Culver City, according to a report in today's editions of theLos Angeles Times.   Warner Bros. already owns 65 percent of the Burbank lot, thenewspaper reported.   Sony also would give Warner Bros. a share in the company'slucrative CBS Record Club to release the two producers, the Timessaid.   In exchange, Guber and Peters would have to give up all rightsto Warner-backed film projects, including the two scheduled sequelsto ``Batman,'' the Times and the Los Angeles Herald Examinerreported.   ``They're leaving empty-handed,'' an unidentified source toldthe Herald.   Neither newspaper specified when the tentative agreement wasreached or when it might become official.   Sony wants Guber and Peters to run Columbia Pictures, which theJapanese company is acquiring for $3.4 billion. Sony also is payingthe pair $200 million for their Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.   Warner, a unit of Time Warner Inc., contends it already hasinvested or committed $13 million in 50 projects under developmentby Guber and Peters.   The two producers said in court documents that Warner had letthem out of their contract with an oral agreement.   In a court filing, Warner Bros. President Terry Semel deniedletting Guber and Peters go.   ``I do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements,especially when they involve key talent and millions of dollars,''Semel said.   The estimated cost of the settlement deal between theentertainment companies over Guber and Peters could run as high as$500 million, mostly in a swap of property and film rights, asource told the Herald.   ``This deal is going to end up costing Sony a bundle,'' thesource said.</TEXT></DOC>
