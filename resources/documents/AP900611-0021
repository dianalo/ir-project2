They include a wide range of enterprising people. There's thelittle boy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, who buys a package ofcigarettes and sells them one by one on a street corner. He pays notax or license fee and makes a small profit.   There are also the 70 families of squatters in a Latin Americancapital who stole their electricity when the power company refusedto sell it.   A study published last week by the private World ResourcesInstitute with two United Nations agencies pulled together much ofthe investigation done on what economists have dubbed the informalsector.   It said many planners now see it as probably the greatest sourceof new jobs in Third World cities.   In the year 2000, Mexico City is expected to have more than 27million people and Bombay, India, more than 15 million. That givesplenty of room for volunteer groups that in many places alreadyhelp supply drinking water, sanitation, small loans and evenrecycling services.   By the standards of industrialized countries, the pay or profitis low. But even in what the World Bank calls upper-middle-incomecountries, such as Brazil or Malaysia, the average income is around$2,000 a year, one-tenth the U.S. average.   The World Bank, biggest source of aid to the Third World, foundthe electricity thieves in an unnamed Latin American capital. Itsaid the leader of a squatter community told of going to themanager of the power company and being informed that it could notsell to them.   ``In the end he decided to be indulgent with us, in exchange forour promise that we would not abuse our arrangement by `going toofar' with domestic connections,'' the leader was quoted as saying.   ``The fact is that we do not pay for electricity now. It isfree, and we have been able to light our streets, our school andour homes. If there were anything else that we needed and if thegovernment were unwilling to give it to us, then we would just takeit without authorization.''   A study published by the Johns Hopkins University Press told ofshantytown dwellers who collect waste in Montevideo, Uruguay, andseparate the types for recycling. But the necessary washing ofplastics takes too much labor. So they farm out that part of thejob to small family enterprises that can do it more cheaply.   The same study reported that in Niamey, Niger, tinsmiths andblacksmiths recycled scrap metal and made 30,000 stoves in twoyears. The efficient stoves cut the consumption of scarce fuel wood.   It estimated that in most Third World countries the informalsector includes 30 percent to 70 percent of the working population.</TEXT></DOC>
