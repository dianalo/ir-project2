Gottschalk Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> EDP STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Last October's stock market crash forever soured Tom Collins, a 46-year-old Athens, Ga., investor, on the seven full-service brokers he was using.    &quot;After I finally got them on the telephone, they either panicked or were totally depressed,&quot; he says. &quot;They argued me out of everything I wanted to do.&quot; So he started looking for an alternative.    Since February, Mr. Collins, owner of a mobile-home business, has used a computerized investment system run by discount broker Quick andamp; Reilly Inc. to make his own decisions on stocks and to place buy and sell orders. Mr. Collins receives real-time stock quotes on one computer at his office and uses another to do technical analysis on stocks. He enters most of his trades at night on his home computer. &quot;Now I am in control,&quot; he says.    Considering the reduced interest in the stock market among individual investors, computerized investing is doing surprisingly well. In fact, it is one of the few areas in the battered discount-brokerage business showing any life. Charles Schwab andamp; Co., the nation's largest discount broker, now has 26,000 customers for its Equalizer computerized trading system, up from 15,000 a year ago. Fidelity Discount Investors, part of Fidelity Investments, says the number of people using its Fidelity Express service has doubled to 10,000 in the past year without any promotion. Quick andamp; Reilly says the Quick Way system that Mr. Collins uses has shown &quot;steady growth.&quot;    Ethel Daily, senior vice president for Schwab, predicts that in 10 years, at least 30% of all trades by Schwab customers will be placed by home computer, up from 5% today. &quot;Desktop investing is the next big development in the brokerage business,&quot; says David J. Cariseo, president of Fidelity Discount Investors.    Many people say they've become computerized because they believe it's the only way to compete with institutional investors. &quot;On-line&quot; systems, the basic service connecting investors to the brokerage firms, typically allow users to check current stock prices, place their orders and check their portfolios through programs that automatically update the value of their holdings. Investors can also check current news, usually at extra cost.    &quot;Off-line&quot; software programs, for which the brokerage firms act as marketers, enable investors to do fundamental and technical analysis on stocks and bonds.    The vast majority of investors, of course, still prefer to buy and sell stocks and other investments with a live human being giving advice, or at least taking their order. And not every venture in computerized investing has been successful. Security Pacific Bank's discount brokerage firm scrapped its On-Line Advantage computerized investing program in 1986, two years after starting it. &quot;We found a lot of resistance in the 35- to 55-year-old age group and a lack of interest in the affluent 65- to 70-year-old group,&quot; says James Quandt, president of Security Pacific Brokers in Pasadena, Calif.    The major full-service brokerage firms don't offer computerized trading services to their customers. Their computerized systems are designed to deliver information, strategy and analysis to their account executives, who sell investment products to their clients. A system at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. provides stock prices, the current market value of an investor's portfolio, and Dean Witter opinions and market strategy, but trades are made through a Dean Witter account executive.    Many people, however, see computerized trading as a significant advance. The crash is one reason: While it drove many investors from the stock market, it impressed on many others the importance of being able to stay up to the minute on the market and place orders quickly in a crisis. &quot;If you can buy and sell with a personal computer, you can't be put on hold,&quot; says William Coppel, a Quick andamp; Reilly marketing executive.    But Michael Gianturco, author of &quot;The Stock Market Investor's Computer Guide,&quot; notes that computers use telephone lines to communicate with the brokers' electronic systems. And when the telephone lines are jammed, he says, a computerized trader won't be able to get through any better than anyone else trying desperately to call a broker, he says.    Carl Camenisch, 40, an Orinda, Calif., investor who uses Schwab's Equalizer service, adds: &quot;On busy trading days, I haven't been able to get onto the system.&quot;    But many computerized investors say that on normal days, placing orders is faster with a computer than over the telephone to a broker. &quot;I've had trades entered and confirmed in less than a minute,&quot; says Melvin Kagan, a 59-year-old retired airline pilot who lives in Honolulu.    In the seesaw market since the crash, many investors have found that computer trading is the quickest and easiest way to make money. Since February, Mr. Collins, for example, has been buying and selling stocks daily to try to capture price swings of as little as $1 or $2.    Mr. Collins says his computerized system has allowed him to use technical analysis (which studies historical patterns in the price movement of stocks), live stock quotes and computerized stock orders to move quickly in and out of certain stocks. In the seven months since he started using Quick Way, he says, he's made 20% to 25% on his money, after commission costs.    &quot;Lots of singles and doubles, but no home runs,&quot; Mr. Collins says. &quot;I could never do that by using a full-service broker. The commissions would eat up my profits.&quot; And even at a discount broker, without computerized trading, &quot;I'd be on the telephone all the time.&quot;    Even long-term buy-and-hold investors like being able to use the computer to do their own analysis, check on their portfolios and make trades. Mr. Kagan in Honolulu says he uses the Schwab Equalizer and other software to find, among other things, companies' breakup values and price-earnings ratios, both fundamental indicators of a company's value.    Costs of computerized investing are fairly minimal for someone who already has a personal computer and modem. Trading time -- getting prices, placing orders and checking one's portfolio -- is free on the Schwab system after a $99 sign-up fee. Quick Way, reached through any of four different information services, has no sign-up or annual fees, but costs 44 cents a minute to use during the day and 27 1/2 cents a minute at other times. Users of Fidelity Express reach it through Dow Jones News/Retrieval, which charges a $12 annual fee and a minimum monthly fee of $8; Fidelity charges 30 cents a minute during the day and 10 cents a minute at other times.    Errors in placing trades haven't been a problem because of &quot;fail-safe&quot; techniques in the computerized systems, investors say. Mr. Camenisch says he hasn't made any mistakes in three years of trading through the Schwab system, which requires an investor to enter an order and then confirm it before transmitting it to the brokerage. Also, he says, the system &quot;won't let you sell something you don't have, nor will it let you buy over your (margin) limit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
