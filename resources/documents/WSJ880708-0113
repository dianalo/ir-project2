The recall affects 240,000 1985-87 model Encores and Alliances that contain a heater core in the passenger compartment that may spray steam and hot water onto the driver's legs if it ruptures. Chrysler is sending the owners a new pressure cap for the car's engine cooling system in an effort to correct the defect that has caused 39 reported injuries, a Chrysler spokeswoman said.    The No. 3 auto maker said it is also recalling an additional 149,000 1983-84 model Encores and Alliances equipped with rocker-recliner seats for drivers because they require a stronger bracket to keep from tipping backward. Chrysler said it has received 50 complaints, including three reports of minor back or neck injuries caused by the defect. The company said it will notify the owners this fall when a reinforced seat bracket is available.    American Motors Corp. halted production of the Alliance in the 1987 model year and Encore in the 1986 model year after sales fell sharply because of widespread quality complaints. Chrysler assumed responsibility for recalling the cars last August when it acquired Regie Nationale des Usines Renault's 46% stake in AMC. </TEXT></DOC>
