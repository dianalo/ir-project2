The Communist Party daily also reported that Soviet troops wouldmove Monday out of the main military complex at Shindand, in westernAfghanistan. The paper said Soviet defensive checkpoints along thewithdrawal route from the capital had been removed as far as 50miles north of Kabul.   ``Yesterday, the last Soviet soldier left Kabul,'' Pravda said inMonday's report.   However, several hundred Soviet soldiers were seen at the airporttoday. Soviet officials said about 1,000 Soviet soldiers were stillat the airport on the outskirts of the city.   They said the last convoy left the capital on Saturday.   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thetroops at the airport are assisting the supply airlift into the cityand are not expected to pull out until Feb. 12 or Feb. 14.   The officials said troops were still moving up the SalangHighway, the only land route north from Kabul to the Soviet border.They said the troop movement was slow and there had been avalanchesand some casualties, but no rebel attacks.   On Sunday, Radio Moscow quoted the commander of Soviet forces inAfghanistan, Gen. Boris Gromov, as saying the withdrawal wasproceeding according to schedule.   ``He said that the column of Soviet troops did not come underfire. ... There were snow slides during the withdrawal, though, andthree men were killed and one was injured by them,'' the radioreported.   In Kabul on Sunday, President Najib told about 10,000 members ofthe People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan that his Marxistgovernment will survive the rebel onslaught despite the Sovietpullout after more than nine years of occupation.   ``God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war,''Najib told about 10,000 members of the People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan, who gathered in freezing temperatures near thepresidential palace.   Soviet and Afghan officials said during the weekend there wereabout 1,000 Soviet soldiers still in Afghanistan and that they couldbe gone as early as Wednesday.   In neighboring Pakistan, Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze extended talks on the civil war. Guerrilla sources saidhe would meet Monday with the Moslem insurgents fighting theSoviet-backed Afghan government.   Leaders of the Iran- and Pakistan-based resistance signed acooperation pact Sunday in the Iranian capital, Iran's foreignminister, Ali Akbar Velayati said. The agreement could boost theguerrillas' chances of taking over in Afghanistan and creating anIslamic republic once the Soviets are gone.   Najib's rally, broadcast on national television, was stagedlargely for the dozens of foreign journalists in Afghanistan for theSoviet withdrawal.   ``The Russian armies are leaving the country and we will defendourselves,'' said the 43-year-old Najib, dressed in combat fatigues.``We have to be strong. We have to unite.''   As he spoke, more than a dozen giant Soviet transport planesstreaked off in different directions, spewing flares designed todeflect heat-seeking missiles fired by the guerrillas, or mujahedeen.   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 toreplace one Marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight theU.S.- and Pakistani-backed insurgents.   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, Moscow agreed last year towithdraw all its troops out by Feb. 15.   The Soviets began their pullout in May and resumed it January,when convoys of tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers startedheading up the Salang Highway toward the Soviet border 260 milesaway.   The Pravda report said that in the western sector, two columnshad left Shindand heading towards Kushka on the Soviet border.   ``On Feb. 6, Soviet units will leave shindand,'' Pravda said.   ``On Monday, the first meeting to welcome the columns crossing tothe Soviet bank will take place in Termez in southern Uzbekistan''it said.   The guerrilla leaders began arriving in Islamabad, Pakistan, onSunday night to confer before meeting with Shevardnadze, guerrillasources said.   Velayati refused to give details of the guerrilla accord signedin Iran. The Afghan guerrillas are split into two groups: theminority Shiite alliance, based in Iran, and the larger Sunnicoalition in Pakistan.   ``They finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a futuregovernment for Afghanistan,'' he told The Associated Press.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,said it was believed the two groups agreed on the number of seatsthat will be offered in the 480-member Shura assembly to Shiiterepresentatives.</TEXT></DOC>
