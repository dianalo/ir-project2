Bob Lucas, who attaches engines to chassis, has seen the difference compared with other GM plants where he worked before. The work place is safer now, he says, and complaints formerly ignored by supervisors get taken care of right away. &quot;The people are closer together,&quot; he explains.    But Tom Bouchard, an assembler, says the only change is that the union now &quot;is more for management than for the people.&quot; The company, he says, still ignores his attempts to fix defects on the line. The United Auto Workers local, in fact, is threatening a strike vote next week over a host of grievances. &quot;Management says, 'joint, joint, joint,'&quot; complains Local 599 President Fred Myers. &quot;But if they want to do something, they just go ahead and do it.&quot;    Joint labor-management efforts to enhance quality and efficiency have been a major part of the UAW's strategy over the past five years, as the union has shifted its emphasis from economic gains to job security. But the record has been mixed, and the wisdom of that approach will be the source of a scrappy debate this weekend. Union delegates, 3,000 strong, will gather in Chicago for the UAW's first broad discussion of general bargaining priorities for the national contract negotiations later this year with GM and Ford Motor Co.    Some members, furious at the companies, say such programs have failed to protect jobs, and have served simply to give management more power over workers. They vow a floor fight at the four-day convention to make their views heard. But others, afraid of growing foreign competition, say that the difficulties have been temporary and that the union has no choice but to keep trying.    The UAW was forced onto its current path by the early 1980s recession. But despite the relatively healthy economy, the union's position now seems almost as grim. GM continues to trim its production schedules and lay off workers, and next month it will begin the three-year process of closing all or part of 11 plants. And things will only get tougher not only at GM but at the presently healthy Ford, as both companies slash costs by shipping work to cheaper suppliers, particularly in low-wage Asian countries and Mexico.    Furthermore, the union's ability to control events continues to dwindle because of imports; non-UAW, Japanese-owned plants in the U.S.; and the recent secession of its Canadian arm. Union leaders have, in fact, been quite frank in recent months about their impotence, buying national television advertisements and making frequent lobbying visits to Washington to push for trade restrictions. &quot;There's no use in kidding anybody,&quot; says UAW President Owen F. Bieber. &quot;We can't do it all at the bargaining table.&quot;    That crisis atmosphere has created a renewed activism among the rank-and-file chided in recent years for apathy in union affairs. Spurred in part by the commemoration in February of the 50th anniversary of the watershed Flint sit-down strike against GM, the list of protests has snowballed to include in-plant rallies at GM's Detroit Cadillac plant slated to close by the end of the year, regular monthly protests in front of GM's headquarters, and even a picket last month in front of Solidarity House, the UAW's headquarters.    Beneath that veneer of unified militance, however, many desperate workers are seeking to save themselves at the expense of their brethren. One grass-roots coalition, for example, wants changes in the contracts to favor higher-seniority workers even more. &quot;I've got 17 years' seniority. I don't think it's fair I should be on the street, while some guy with only four or five years is working,&quot; says Dennis Wack, laid off in January from GM's Saginaw, Mich., foundry.    Given the pressing problems still facing UAW members, the main questions are: Have they benefited from the radical changes they have accepted since 1982, and are they worth continuing? The union has no clear-cut answers. Everybody praises the success of joint programs on issues like safety and training. But the more ambiguous programs changing the way plants are run have drawn mixed reviews.    &quot;The attitudes of companies have changed,&quot; Mr. Bieber says. In the past, he notes, &quot;you were there to run a machine, that was your job, and beyond that, it was the supervisor's job.&quot; Now, &quot;they do involve workers, they do accept worker input in the plant today.&quot;    Last year, workers at GM's parts plant in Bay City, Mich., adopted a new &quot;living agreement&quot; with the company that has no expiration date, allowing workers and managers to deal with problems as they come rather than the traditional method of adopting and altering local contracts only every three years. The changes make the plant more efficient and less vulnerable to cutbacks, says Jack Whyte, the local union's shop chairman.    But changes haven't come easily, and they haven't spread uniformly throughout Ford and GM. Donald F. Ephlin, a UAW vice president and its chief apostle of joint union-company programs, gave a surprisingly blunt speech and news conference this week at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich. &quot;It's not enough to read in the paper what (GM Chairman) Roger Smith says,&quot; argued Mr. Ephlin. &quot;We have to see it happening in 155 GM plants all over the country.&quot; But, he said, &quot;their managers don't get the message sometimes. That's the problem.&quot;    Joint &quot;quality-of-work life&quot; programs in several plants have been scrapped in recent years because of flare-ups between local management and union officials. More than 9,000 workers struck GM's Pontiac, Mich., truck and bus complex two weeks ago over a variety of issues, one of which was that the company docked the pay of workers who didn't show up at weekly quality meetings -- even though attendance was supposed to be voluntary.    Top-level corporate decisions have also dismayed union leaders -- the Ross Perot buyout, executive bonuses, a stock buyback -- particulary as workers aren't getting any profit-sharing payments this year.    Relations in general have been better at Ford, in part because the No. 2 auto maker recently paid workers an average of more than $2,100 in profit-sharing for 1986. But Ford has been as aggressive as GM at shipping work to outside suppliers. Ford last week told union officials at its Rawsonville, Mich., plant that it would transfer the production of heater and air conditioner fans -- and about 200 jobs -- to a General Electric Co. plant in Arkansas. In 1984, that local union had adopted one of the more innovative labor contracts in the Ford system.    &quot;We have done a lot of things within the plant to help the company, then for everything we have done here, we get slapped in the face,&quot; complains David Schaar, the local union's bargaining chairman.    &quot;The companies are pursuing a dual strategy that isn't workable,&quot; says Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at San Diego. One way to become competitive, he says, &quot;is to seek increased cooperation and commitment in the U.S. with an implied understanding that the future of the industry means the preservation of jobs. The other is to seek the lowest-cost production anywhere in the world. There's going to be a problem on how these fit together.&quot;    UAW hardliners are using those problems to call for an end to cooperation, portraying the programs as a Trojan horse being used in an attempt to break the union. They are especially bitter about a recent spate of changes in local contracts, altering work rules and other practices built up over several decades.    That faction has always existed in the union. But its strength may be growing as plants cooperating with management have still been affected by cuts. Last January, for example, GM announced it would close a parts plant in Detroit even though workers agreed to cut job classifications and reduce the work force.    Two of the union's better-known dissidents have led successful strikes against GM in recent months, enhancing their status among the rank-and-file. When Donny G. Douglas, president of the Pontiac, Mich., local, addressed a recent &quot;Workers Opposed to Concessions&quot; rally in Flint, he was given a standing ovation.    And in an election for one of the union's 15 regional directorships last year, Jerry Tucker, a young militant with a campaign highly critical of top UAW officials, came within a fraction of a vote of defeating a longtime incumbent. The U.S. Labor Department has alleged improprieties and has sued for a re-vote.    &quot;If GM won't make adjustments in their strategy, we have to say to GM that the era of cooperation and accommodation is over,&quot; says Mr. Tucker. Mr. Ephlin, he says, &quot;is going to find at some point his credibility is not worth two cents and he can't sell a contract to those workers.&quot;    Mr. Ephlin, responding to the hardliners, says &quot;there are some people in the union who have their head in the sand. . . . We are working with (the companies) to try and improve quality, not because we're nice guys, but that's part of job security.&quot; He adds, &quot;What are the alternatives?&quot;    ---          Past UAW Contracts With GM and Ford   1976 -- After a monthlong strike against Ford, UAW getstraditional, 3% annual wage increases plus 20 cents an hourthe first year and 13 extra paid vacation days over threeyears.   1979 -- In the last of the traditional contracts, UAW gets3%-a-year wage increases, pension increases of as much as 40%over three years and a boost in paid holidays to 26 from 12over three years.   1982 -- Recession-pinched auto makers pressure UAW intoconvening talks six months earlier than scheduled. Uniongives up two annual, 3% wage increases, defers cost-of-livingboosts and sacrifices the equivalent of two weeks of paidvacation per year. Companies grant profit-sharing and agreeto begin limited job-security programs.   1984 -- After a weeklong strike, UAW and GM agree on pactthat gives moderate wage increases and creates newjob-security programs.</TEXT></DOC>
