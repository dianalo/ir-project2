Pakistan, meanwhile, said the Afghan government blastedPakistani territory with a Soviet-made Scud missile early Friday.No casualties were reported.   There was no confirmation by Afghan authorities.   The Afghan officials, however, reported more fighting in theeastern city of Jalalabad, acknowledging their unilateralcease-fire had failed hours after it was declared.   The Afghan Foreign Ministry said the U.S. decision to send anenvoy for the guerrillas ``is not only an intervention in theinternal affairs of Afghanistan, but it is also a provocativeaction that is assisting the extremists.''   Sources in Washington said the Bush administration isdesignating Peter Tomsen, the No. 2 diplomat at the U.S. Embassy inBeijing, as a special envoy to the Pakistan-based guerrillas.   The Moslem guerrillas have been trying for the last decade tooust the Soviet-style party that took power by coup andassassination in 1978.   On Feb. 23, the guerrillas selected an interim government theyhope will replace Najib's government.   Government spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani, reading thedenunciation to reporters, accused the United States of violating a1988 accord that paved the way for Soviet withdrawal fromAfghanistan and ended nine years of Moscow's combat support forKabul.   Under the U.N.-sponsored accord, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreednot to intervene in each other's internal affairs. The UnitedStates and the Soviet Union signed the accord as guarantors.   By designating a special envoy to the guerrillas, the UnitedStates ``has tried to give an impetus to the fading, decliningexistence of the so-called interim government,'' Amani said.   ``It would be better for the United States, if the United Statesis truly, faithfully demanding peace, to pressure Pakistan to stopintervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,'' he said.   Kabul has accused Pakistan of massing as many as 8,000 of itssoldiers and militiamen to participate in the Afghan civil war.   The government spokesman acknowledged that Kabul was stillreceiving Soviet weapons but said this should not be compared toU.S. support for the guerrillas.   ``Afghanistan is a country that is recognized by 84 countries ofthe world, Amani said. ``Only three reactionary countries haverecognized this so-called interim government _ Saudi Arabia, Sudanand Bahrain.''   All three are Moslem nations, and Saudi Arabia has been a majorbacker of the guerrillas, along with the United States, Pakistanand China.   The United States and Afghanistan have diplomatic relations, butthe United States closed its embassy and evacuated remainingdiplomats before the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15,saying it feared security would deteriorate once the Red Army wasgone.   Kabul has remained relatively calm since the Soviet pullout,although at least 12 people were killed by guerrilla rockets thisweek.   Instead, the guerrillas have focused on Jalalabad, 75 miles eastof Kabul and 40 miles from the Pakistan border.   The guerrillas launched an offensive on Jalalabad on March 6 butso far have failed to capture it. Jalalabad would give theguerrillas an Afghan base for their interim government.   Amani said guerrillas and government soldiers exchanged rocketfire at Jalalabad in the last 24 hours. He said 148 oppositionfighters, nine civilians and one Afghan government soldier werekilled.   In Pakistan, the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said that 80Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting around the city in the pastthree days.   The reports could not be confirmed, since Jalalabad isoff-limits to foreign reporters and other independent observers.   Amani said guerrilla fire killed three women and five childrenin Khost in Paktia province, and government fire killed 15opposition fighters in Kandahar province.</TEXT></DOC>
