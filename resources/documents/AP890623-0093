The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said the federal Freedom ofInformation Act imposes such a duty on the Justice Department's taxdivision.   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costsand burdens'' at taxpayer expense, had urged the high court to rulethat the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy does not gothat far.   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reportinglegislative, judicial and regulatory development in federaltaxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies offederal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from theindividual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining themquickly.   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine'sFOIA request, and a federal judge upheld the denial.   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last year ruled thatthe government must comply with the FOIA requests, and today'sdecision upheld that ruling.   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analystsrequests on a regular basis will cost nearly $75,000 a year forsearch time alone.   They had told the court that commercial publishers and law firmswould flood the Justice Department with similar requests if theappeals court ruling were not overturned.   But writing for the court today, Justice Thurgood Marshall saidJustice Department officials ``improperly withheld agency records''as defined by the FOIA.   Only Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, saying, ``It seems tome that the lnguage of the statute is not that clear or conclusiveon the issue and, more important, because the result the courtreaches cannot be one that was within the intent of Congress whenthe FOIA was enacted.''   The case is U.S. Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.</TEXT></DOC>
