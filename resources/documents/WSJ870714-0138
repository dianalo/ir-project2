Parker, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Newmont Mining Corp., is convinced that his company is high on the target lists of all the world's corporate raiders. It has low debt, a lot of cash and a strong cash flow. More to the point, its Nevada mines have the largest known gold reserves in North America at a time when gold has taken on a new glitter for investors.    &quot;Our company must pop out of every computer study {of takeover targets} that is done,&quot; says Mr. Parker. &quot;Analysts are saying Newmont, Newmont, Newmont. I can just see it because we're busy looking at other companies. We don't find any quite as good as us. It's a little disturbing.&quot;    Newmont fended off a takeover by Consolidated Gold Fields PLC with a 10-year agreement in 1983 limiting CGF to one-third voting power. CGF currently has 26.24%. But for Mr. Parker, &quot;the best protection is to reward your shareholders with a high share price. Our function is to make sure that the current shareholder doesn't lose out to another shareholder at an inadequate price. If something came along at an enormous price we would be doing our shareholders a disservice by not encouraging them to sell. We're working very hard to create shareholder value and we've been very successful. Our shareholders are a very happy lot. They're delirious.&quot;    Quite possibly so. Newmont's stock has appreciated by some 150% over the past 18 months. The company has solved a knotty problem, what to do with Magma Copper Co., a big money loser in years past; it spun off 80% of Magma as a dividend to shareholders. Now, with copper prices improving, even Magma's shares are showing some life. Other restructuring has made Newmont more and more of a holding company, with a special focus on gold, coal and oil.    Of these, gold is the most exciting. Mainly because of the $100-an-ounce run-up in the world market price over the past year, Newmont's gold mines in the U.S. and Australia earned $31.6 million in the first quarter, more than double the $13.7 million of a year earlier.    World-wide gold production has been rising. Mine development in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea was cranked up in 1980 when gold soared above $800. Production continued to rise through price rises and declines. Canada, PNG and the U.S. have doubled and Australia quadrupled output over the past five years. That has more than offset a recent dip in South Africa, by far the largest Free World producer.    Production has little bearing on price, however. &quot;There's so much gold above ground just sitting everywhere that the next 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons that are going to be produced are absolutely insignificant,&quot; says Mr. Parker. &quot;It is what the investor thinks about the value of gold that counts. And obviously the investor currently believes that gold is undervalued or is correctly valued at $450.&quot;    Some 70% of current production is fabricated into jewelry, with dental work and industrial uses taking up maybe an additional 10%. So only about 20% of current production is bought for investment. Central banks hold some 30% of all the gold ever mined, according to a Goldman Sachs estimate. That's about $500 billion worth at current prices. Goldman Sachs predicts a net increase in central bank reserves this year of 2.5 million ounces compared with 1.5 million last year.    &quot;One sees little evidence of any of the reserve banks promoting a return to the gold standard,&quot; says Mr. Parker. &quot;Yet they hang on to what they've got because it is the ultimate store of value. Even those who don't believe in this barbaric relic hang on to some, and that's been the way through centuries of history.&quot;    The demise in the U.S. of the Krugerrand brought about by sanctions against South Africa has stimulated governments elsewhere to mint gold coins. Australia was the latest addition to that group. Japan not only consumed substantial quantities of gold minting its Emperor Hirohito medal last year but the Japanese, who are top-heavy with dollars, are also heavy buyers of gold coins minted in the U.S. and elsewhere.    The coin business is not a big business but Mr. Parker likes to see gold go into coins because it broadens investment interest in gold. Many individual investors can afford one-ounce coins but few have the means or inclination to buy a one-kilogram bar.    The technology of gold mining has been advancing rapidly, particularly as it applies to operations such as Newmont's mines in Nevada. Gold ore is not only milled to extract the metal but gold also can be leached out of ore with a cyanide solution. This dissolves the gold, allowing minute quantities to be recovered from the runoff.    A more significant advance has been in assaying techniques to make maximum use of low-grade deposits. Newmont Gold Co., a subsidiary that through recent public offerings is now 10% publicly owned, has computerized and automated assays to the point where it can estimate with some accuracy the gold content of every truckload of ore and hence direct each load to the most efficient form of extraction. In the first quarter, Newmont Gold's cash cost for each ounce it sold fell to $148 from $160 a year earlier. Its overall cost reduction was only $4 because royalties rose sharply, but the operating decline signifies sharp technological gains.    Newmont mines more of its lower grade ore when the price goes up so as to get maximum use, over time, of its reserves, says Mr. Parker. &quot;We would make more profit in any one year if we didn't lower the grade, but we would not be maximizing the profit out of the reserves, which is what good businesslike mining tries to do.&quot;    At the company's Gold Quarry ore body in the first quarter last year, the cutoff grade was 0.2 of an ounce a ton. This year, it has been lowered to 0.1 of an ounce. To the extent an ore body's life can be extended, the mining company's asset base is improved even without new discoveries. Mr. Parker says Newmont can make money today at a $200 gold price.    Indeed, he sees a fundamental change in the world's use of resources. &quot;We are being far more skillful in the use of material. Consumption is on the increase but at a much lower rate.&quot;    Resource companies didn't perceive this structural change in the early 1980s and their failure to do so, along with deflation, cost many of them dearly. At one time they could count on inflation to bail out marginal projects. Now they can't.    Mr. Parker says Newmont will go only into projects &quot;where we know we can survive at the bottom of the trough on price and not be under pressure.&quot; That implies maintaining a low level of debt and holding down costs as well.    Its conservatism, particularly with regard to debt, helped see the company through the early 1980s, when a good many other once-proud resource companies were threatened with extinction. If Mr. Parker is right about the new era resource companies are facing, prospective raiders might be wise to look beyond the glitter of Newmont's gold reserves. Heavy debt leveraging, which has typified a good many takeover efforts, is dangerous to a resource company's future health. Moreover, at Newmont, the shareholders seem to be faring rather well with what they have. </TEXT></DOC>
