(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's wife blamed his emotionalcollapse on a reaction to medication and a former PTL official saidthere's ``no way'' Bakker faked the breakdown, but a federalprosecutor called it ``awfully suspect.''   Whatever the truth, the future of the TV evangelist's fraud andconspiracy trial is in doubt while he undergoes evaluation at apsychiatric hospital at the Federal Correctional Institution atButner.   The judge sent Bakker, sobbing, disheveled and shackled in armand leg chains, to Butner on Thursday after his psychiatristtestified he had been hallucinating, curled in a fetal position andhiding his head under a couch in his lawyer's office.   The collapse came in the fourth day of Bakker's trial.Prosecutors allege Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry fundsto finance a lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 chargesagainst him, Bakker would face 120 years in prison and more than $5million in fines.   Bakker's lawyers say he was not competent to continue with thetrial; a court observer said that even if Bakker is deemed competentafter the evaluation, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter will havelittle choice but to declare a mistrial if the psychiatricevaluation takes too long.   ``I think the trial will resume at some point,'' said MikeScofield, a former federal prosecutor. ``I don't know if it will bethis jury because there could be a long continuance.''   ``The problem then will be the difficulty of picking anotherjury,'' Scofield said. Defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully formonths to move the trial out of Charlotte because of pretrialpublicity.   Dr. Sally Johnson, Butner's chief of psychiatric services, saidevaluations of patients like Bakker typically take 30 days but cantake 45 days or longer. Scofield says the law bars holding Bakkermore than four months.   Tammy Faye Bakker said Friday night her husband had suffered anallergic reaction to an anti-depressant medication.   ``There is no reason at all for Jim to be in prison,'' Mrs.Bakker said after meeting with her husband for six hours. ``He justliterally had more (medication) than he could handle. I think JudgePotter is being very unfair.'' Bakker's psychiatrist, Dr. BasilJackson, had told Potter he prescribed the sedative Xanax for Bakkerwhen the evangelist hallucinated Wednesday after a witness fainted.   However, The Charlotte Observer on Saturday quoted Jackson assaying the amount of medication Bakker had been given ``wasinfinitesimal because I recognized his concern about overreaction.''   Jackson had tried to persuade the judge to allow Bakker to entera private hospital, rather than the prison facility.   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer who has co-starred with Bakker ontheir talk-show style religious TV programs, denied that Bakkerfaked his attack.   ``If you had seen Mr. Bakker, you would know he doesn't perform.He's just Jim, not a performer,'' she said.   Don Hardister, former security chief at the multimillion-dollarPTL television ministry, said the collapse was not Bakker's first.   Hardister recalled that Bakker suffered an emotional breakdownafter his resignation from PTL in March 1987. Bakker called hisbodyguard to his Palm Springs, Calif., home at 3 a.m. and wasconvinced Jerry Falwell had stolen the ministry from him. Falwelltemporarily ran the ministry after Bakker left.   ``He was slumped over, looking real bad,'' Hardister recalled.``He just kept saying, `He stole it. He stole it.''' Hardister saidhe stayed up with Bakker for three nights, keeping razors and knivesaway from him.   ``I think he will recover but I don't think it will be quick,''Hardister said. Asked if he thought Bakker was faking, Hardisterreplied, ``No way.''   Bakker, in his 1976 autobiography, wrote about another breakdownhe said he suffered in 1969, when he was part of Pat Robertson's TVministry.   ``Problems loomed completely out of proportion to their actualsize,'' Bakker wrote. ``It seemed as if whatever little control Ihad over myself might snap any minute, and I'd be floating in anemotional stream unable to return. What if that happened? It seemedlike an endless cycle that I was helpless to stop.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller was skeptical when Bakker'spsychiatrist testified that Bakker could not continue the trial.   On Wednesday, defense lawyer George T. Davis had called Bakker tothe witness stand to pray for prosecution witness Steve Nelson, aformer PTL vice president, who collapsed after giving incriminatingevidence about his boss.   On Thursday, Miller told Potter: ``It's hard to interpret it inany other way than Mr. Davis has once again _ this time he didn'tsummon his client up to pray _ this time he summons a psychiatristup to say that his client can't go forward with the defense, andit's awfully suspect.''   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling thejury nothing about Bakker's condition.</TEXT></DOC>
