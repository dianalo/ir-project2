The U.S. is especially eager to galvanize the talks. &quot;Ourwindow of opportunity is now,&quot; said White House TradeRepresentative Carla Hills in a meeting with reporters hereyesterday. &quot;It's just going to take the political will to doit.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Similarly, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking inLondon before flying to Paris, said, &quot;We are determined tosee these negotiations completed on time and with concreteresults.&quot;   The trade talks, called the Uruguay Round, are designed toestablish rules to govern the approximately one-third ofworld trade that isn't covered by the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. Accomplishing that goal would meanbringing agriculture, services, intellectual property,textiles and trade-related investment under GATT'sjurisdiction, toughening GATT rules and fully integratingdeveloping countries into the 96-nation organization.   The Uruguay Round talks are scheduled to be completed byyear end, but there are growing concerns that negotiatorswon't be able to meet that timetable. Under U.S. law, thetalks must be finished by then or any legislation to put newrules into effect won't qualify for streamlined, &quot;fast-track&quot;consideration by Congress; that would be a severe blow to theprospects for an accord.   U.S. leaders are concerned that the European Communitywon't be willing to commit itself to reduce agriculturalsubsidies substantially. &quot;I think it's important for {the EC}to understand that agriculture is a key to the success of theround,&quot; Mrs. Hills said.   Just last week, President Bush said the U.S. seesagricultural-trade reform as fundamental to the success ofthe GATT talks, which began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in1986. And he pointedly added that the U.S. would preferhaving no agreement to a bad one.   Besides dealing with the GATT talks, economic officialsmeeting here are expected to review recent developments inthe world economy, the transition to market economies inEastern Europe and environmental concerns. They also arelikely to discuss so-called tied-aid, which the U.S. istrying to curtail. Tied aid is foreign assistance thatgovernments provide to developing countries on the conditionthey buy goods from companies in the donor country.   There also may soon be new members of the club of 24 richnations; both South Korea and Singapore are possiblecandidates, according to OECD officials.   Meanwhile yesterday, Treasury Secretary Brady and hiscounterparts from about 40 other countries formally launchedthe new European Bank for Reconstruction andamp; Development in aceremony at the Elysee Palace. The EBRD, which will lend tothe new democracies in Eastern Europe and, to a very limitedextent, to the Soviet Union, is to be based in London.   French President Francois Mitterrand's adviser JacquesAttali will head the new institution, and an American isexpected to fill the No. 2 slot. But at his breakfast addressin London, Mr. Brady said &quot;no decision has been made&quot; on anAmerican deputy for Mr. Attali.   President Mitterrand said he expects the bank to play a&quot;catalytic role&quot; in helping the East bloc nations buildmarket economies. He called for the parliaments of theparticipating nations to ratify the articles of agreementpromptly. The bank will begin formal operations oncetwo-thirds have done so.   Separately, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye thisweek took a positive view of the state of the global economy,but he added that there are &quot;dark spots in the picture.&quot; Inits annual forecast released for the meeting, the OECDpredicted the economies of the 24-nation group will grow 2.9%this year and next, after inflation. It forecast inflation at4.4% in each of the next two years.   The OECD isn't worried that German unification willrekindle inflation. Indeed, the OECD predicted that even withfull economic unification, German inflation would rise to 3%this year and 3.4% next -- comfortably below the OECDaverage.   But the OECD forecasts a rise in U.S. inflation to 4.2%this year and 4.5% in 1991 from 4.1% in 1989. Theorganization doesn't foresee a recession in the U.S. soon. Itpredicts the U.S. economy will grow 2.3% this year and 2.5%next year, after inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
