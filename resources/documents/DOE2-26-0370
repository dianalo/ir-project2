Secondary air inlets and an insulated combustion chamber abovethe bed will increase the temperature level where hydrocarbons and dioxinesbreak down and by mixing the flue gases with air maintain the high temperatureduring the break-down process. Thereafter the hot flue gases are mixedwith cooler flue gases and/or air through-inlets where the flue gasesenter the convections and/or superheater surfaces. (L.F.).</TEXT></DOC>
