The Philadelphia law firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauleyagreed to settle the suit over management of a savings and loanassociation that closed two years ago.   The settlement was the largest ever paid by a law firm to thefederal agency to settle a claim, the FSLIC said in a statement.   Proceeds from the settlement will be shared by the FSLIC andformer stock owners of Sunrise Savings and Loan Association ofBoynton Beach, Fla. Included in the settlement is the establishmentof a $10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outsideparties against the law firm, which represented Sunrise.   David Girard-di Carlo, managing partner of Blank Rome, saidTuesday the settlement was a ``proper business decision.''   ``I believe settlement of the case is in the best interest ofthe firm and all parties involved,'' he said.   He added that he expected ``negative inferences'' to be drawnbecause of the amount of the settlement but said the firm continuesto deny the allegations.   The suit, filed in 1986 in U.S. District Court, charged that thelaw firm acted negligently in advising Sunrise, improperly closedloans, aided former Sunrise officials in violating several statutesand banking regulations and represented parties with conflicts ofinterest.   The FSLIC sued the thrift's former officers, directors andlawyers, including 87 partners and former partners at Blank Rome.   Under the agreement, the FSLIC will receive 72 percent of thefirst $40 million and 95 percent of the remaining $10 million.Unused funds will revert to FSLIC and shareholders by August 1992.   Sunrise was closed in 1986 and insured accounts were transferredto the newly created Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association.   ``This settlement demonstrates that where violationscontributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence ormalpractice of professionals, including law firms, the (FederalHome Loan) Bank Board will hold them, as well as thrift management,fully responsible and accountable,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairmanof the bank board.   Blank Rome senior partner Michael Foxman founded Sunrise in1980. His law firm colleague, M. Kalman Gitomer, once served aschairman of the thrift.   David Berger, a Philadelphia attorney representing theshareholders, said it was an ``excellent settlement.''</TEXT></DOC>
