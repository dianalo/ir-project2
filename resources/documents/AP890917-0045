Hungary's foreign minister, meanwhile, defended his country'sdecision to aid the immigrant exodus and said the Warsaw Pact shouldstick to military defense and not dictate ideology or foreign policyto its members.   In West Germany, officials said they registered 1,400 new EastGerman refugees during the weekend, bringing to more than 16,000 thenumber of East Germans who have arrived since Hungary threw open itsborders to the West one week ago.   East German officials have said they would not crack down onvisas for citizens wishing to visit Hungary. But refugees andcharity workers at camps in Hungary said travel documents were infact being seized.   ``More and more people are telling us that their visas are beingtaken from them,'' said Wolfgang Wagner, head of the West GermanMaltese Aid Service. ``Some have told me that state security hadcome to their apartments to take the visas.''   Others were forced off East German and Czechoslovak trains andreturned home, Wagner said in an interview. A growing number wereforced to swim the Danube ``or find other illegal means of cominghere,'' he said.   Going through Czechoslovakia, between East Germany and Hungary,is the most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantageof Hungary's open western border.   A 25-year-old man from East Berlin said he and 15 others enteredHungary Saturday on foot after crowding into three cars and crashingthrough several Czechoslovak border barriers at the Rajka crossing,about 85 miles northwest of Budapest.   He said police in Bratislava took away their travel documents,and at one point they were held at submachine-gun point until theypledged they would not head toward the Hungarian border.   Hungary's role in the refugee affair has been condemned byhard-line Warsaw Pact allies. A senior Communist foreign policyadviser here spoke of Soviet anxiety.   ``It's a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of theSoviet Union,'' Gyula Thuermer was quoted as saying in the VasarnapiHirek newspaper. ``They are worried that Hungarian events willbecome incalculable, and they are also disturbed that there are opendisagreements among their allies.''   The Soviets have criticized West Germany but have refrained fromdirectly accusing Hungary of wrongdoing. But Czechoslovakia andRomania, distrustful of Hungary's plans to hold free elections inJune and other reforms, have joined East Germany in condemningHungary.   Hungary, however, is seeking stronger economic ties with the Westand has embraced social and political reform.   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said the Warsaw Pact shouldstop debating Communist ideology and concentrate on the East bloc'sdefense.   He was quoted by the Yugoslav daily Politika as saying the WarsawPact ``cannot determine what foreign policy steps its individualmembers should take.''   ``The Warsaw Pact should ... not deal with ideological issues, orwith how the political situation in individual member countries isdeveloping,'' he was quoted as saying.   Hungary's break with its hard-line Warsaw Pact allies have wonpraise in the West, and West German Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher proposed Sunday a West European aid program of to supportreforms in East Europe.   Genscher, speaking in a radio interview, compared his proposal tothe U.S. Marshall Plan that helped reconstruct Western Europe afterWorld War II. He said the plan should include food aid, reschedulingof credits and credit guarantees for Western investments.   ``The aim of the plan should not be to enable those socialiststates that refuse reforms to survive a bit longer, but to give achance to reform-minded forces'' such as Poland, Genscher said in aninterview with West Berlin's RIAS radio station.   In Austria, border authorities registered more than 1,600 EastGermans Sunday who crossed during the night from Hungary. WestGerman border officials in Bavaria registered more than 1,400weekend arrivals by early Sunday.   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary forpassage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000,with many fleeing illegally after Hungary demonstrated its openingto the West in May by removing some border fortifications withAustria.</TEXT></DOC>
