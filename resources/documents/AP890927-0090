Times on the convent near Auschwitz:   Thanks to the Vatican's wise and principled intervention, PolishPrimate Jozef Glemp apparently will end his offensive attempt toblock the relocation of a Carmelite convent at the site of theAuschwitz death camp in Poland.   Perhaps Catholics and Jews in Poland and elsewhere can now goabout the more important business of attempting to resolve theunderlying strains that helped to create the wholly unnecessarycontroversy over the convent's fate. ...   While Auschwitz will remain a stark symbol of the deepest evilsof which human beings are capable, the new convent nearby may cometo be seen as evidence of our nobler instincts.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 22   The Capital Times, Madison, Wis., on sex on the college campus:   One of the controversial AIDS ads ... shows a condom next to thewords ``He loves me'' and a blank space next to the words ``Heloves me not.''   Apparently among middle-class college males in Canada _ andlikely among their American counterparts as well _ Option B, ``Heloves me not,'' seems to be in vogue.   A survey of 6,911 white, middle-class college males in Canadafound that 80 percent of them were aware of the role condoms playedin curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Yet only 19percent of the students who were sexually active said they usedcondoms regularly. An amazing 26 percent said they never used them.   These guys are dancing with death, not only for themselves, butfor their sexual partners as well. Of course the images of sex theyoften see _ in movies, on television, in books and magazines _seldom leave the fantasy world far enough to have loversincorporate condoms into their passion. But unprotected sex is notfantasy. It is reality and it can have fatal consequences.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 21   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on a drug war proposal:   The proposal by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to allow lawenforcement agencies to shoot down planes suspected of carryingillegal drugs is preposterous. Yet it passed the Senate last monthby a 55-45 vote as part of a defense-budget bill.   Can you imagine the embarrassment as well as the anguish whensome innocent family, flying home in a Piper Cub from vacation, isshot down and killed by overzealous federal agents?   President Bush has declared war on drug trafficking and weendorse every resonable means to stop this terrible blight on ourcountry. But we don't think the president meant open warfare, whichseems to be McConnell's goal. ...   His fellow senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford, tried to killthe amendment last month. And now Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., sayshe will use his influence on the Senate-House conference committeeto eliminate this part of the bill since the House version has nosuch provision.   We certainly hope Hopkins is successful.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 23   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on controlling the sale of AK-47assault rifles:   Death by AK-47 isn't so far away, after all.   The latest tragedy involving the assault rifle of choice thesedays, the AK-47, was in a Kansas City suburb. ... A young man armedwith his AK-47 was shot dead by police after the man had terrorizedhis neighborhood and refused repeatedly to put the weapon down.   The National Rifle Association and the sycophants who fawnwhenever the gun lobby speaks will surely pronounce the same oldrationalizations for the death. ...   Must the nation continue to be held captive by the gunmanufacturers, the NRA and politicians who grovel in front of both?...   Manufacture and sale of the assault weapons should be outlawed.Period. And beyond that, all firearms sales should be subject tonational controls at least as stringent as those for getting adriver's license.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 22   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on smoking duringflights:   The U.S. Senate and the American tobacco industry go back a longway. Over the years, whenever Congress would try to pass a lawprotecting non-smokers, an alliance of tobacco-financed senatorscould always be counted on to kill or weaken it.   That's why the Senate's recent action on in-flight smoking is soencouraging. For once, the Senate has taken the hard line againsttobacco interests. Pushing aside Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., andother members of the tobacco caucus, the full Senate ... approvedan amendment that would ban smoking on all airline flights in theUnited States.   Most air travelers _ 80 percent of whom don't smoke _ willapplaud the measure. Airlines currently maintain separate seatingsections for smokers, usually in the rear of the airplane. But theair in a pressurized cabin is recirculated; partially filteredsmoke permeates the entire compartment. This may pose genuinehealth risks for asthmatics and flight attendants. For otherpassengers, it can be an obnoxious, annoying nuisance. ...   If the Senate is going to start standing up to Helms andcompany, the tobacco lobby will have a much tougher time buyinginfluence in high places. The industry has lost a lot of its oldinfluence in state capitals: No fewer than 44 states have enactedlaws restricting smoking in lobbies, stores, restaurants and otherpublic places. And most companies now restrict smoking in sharedwork areas. It's a healthy trend.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 23   Philadelphia Daily News on Thunderbird wine:   Gallo is taking Thunderbird out of Skid Row liquor stores,responding to arguments that the accessibility of this cheap wineencourages alcoholism among derelicts.   There's got to be a civil rights issue here. It's inherentlyunfair to restrict Thunderbird to the rich.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
