Ghost fishing describesthe action of fishing gear which continues to operate after all controlof that gear is lost by the fishermen. This requirement becomes effective12 months after the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) specifiesand the Regional Director publishes a list of acceptable escape mechanisms.The earliest implementation date is January 1, 1992.

The objective of the FMP is to support andpromote the development and implementation, on a continuing basis, of aunified regional management program for American lobsters (<T3>Homarus americanus</T3>), which is designed to promote conservation,to reduce the possibility of recruitment failure, and to allow full utilizationof the resource by the U.S. fishing industry. Efforts to better achievethis objective have resulted in Amendment 1 to the FMP in 1986 (51 FR 19210)and Amendment 2 to the FMP in 1987 (52 FR 46088). Amendment 3 to the FMPwas submitted to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) on August 1, 1989,and a notice of availability published on August 10, 1989 (54 FR 32834).The proposed rule for Amendment 3 was published on September 7, 1989 (54FR 37138) and public comments were invited until October 16, 1989.Amendment 3: (1) Delays the implementation of the increase in the escapevent size scheduled for January 1, 1990 until January 1, 1992; and (2)requires that lobster traps contain an escape panel or equivalent mechanismwhich degrades and allows lobsters to escape after a trap has been abandonedor lost for 12 months or more.Amendment 2 increased the minimum legal carapace length of lobsters to3\5/16\ inches, in four steps over a five year period between 1988 and1992. Amendment 2 also required that on January 1, 1992 lobster trap escapevents were to become compatible with a minimum carapace length of 3\5/16\inches. Scientific guidance for the exact specification of this vent sizewas not available at the time the original schedule was set and was tobe promulgated by later rulemaking. Guidance was provided to the Councilby the NMFS in April 1988. Based on this guidance, and consistent withthe objective of the FMP to promote conservation, the Council opted foran escape vent size that maximizes escapement of lobsters smaller thanthe legal size. Requiring that this vent size be implemented in 1990, couldcause an unintended loss in revenue to the fishery, and erode the cooperationand compliance needed to achieve the objectives of the FMP. Therefore,Amendment 3 delays the increase in the vent size requirement until January1, 1992.Amendment 3 also requires that lobster traps contain a biodegradable escapepanel, or equivalent mechanism, to keep a trap from ghost fishing afterit has been abandoned or lost for 12 months or more. The purpose of thisproposal is to reduce fishing mortality caused by lost traps (``ghost fishing'')on all sizes of lobster.This requirement becomes effective January 1, 1992, only if the Councilspecifies, and the Regional Director publishes, consistent with the rulemakingprovision of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 USC andSection; 553) andat least 12 months prior to this date, a list of acceptable escape mechanisms.If a list is not available, or has not been published in final form inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> by January 1, 1991, implementation will occur12 months after publication.The preamble to the proposed rule to implement Amendment 2 described thesemeasures and their rationale and is not repeated here.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses</ITAG>No comments were received either in support or opposition to this amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposed Rule</ITAG>In andSection; 649.21, paragraph c, text is being added that was not includedin the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, has determined that the amendmentthese rules would implement is consistent with the national standards,other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law.The Council prepared within Amendment 3 an environmental assessment (EA).Based on this EA, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, foundthat there will be no significant impact on the environment as a resultof this rule. A copy of the EA and finding of no significant impacts maybe obtained from the Council at the address above.The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, has determined thatthis rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysisunder E.O. 12291. This rule is not likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; or a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domesticor export markets.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result,a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement forthe purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the approved coastalzone management programs of the affected states. This determination hasbeen submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, andNorth Carolina have agreed with the Council's determination. None of theother states commented within the statutory time period, and therefore,consistency is automatically implied. All measures approved were includedin this amendment; therefore this determination remains applicable.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant a federalism assessment under E.O. 12621.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 649</ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
