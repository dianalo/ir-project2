Blumenthal (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS JNJ </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Johnson andamp; Johnson picked Ralph S. Larsen, head of its consumer products segment, as chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Larsen, 49 years old, will succeed James E. Burke, 63, who has led the $9 billion-a-year health-care products company for more than a decade. Under Mr. Burke, the company grew nearly four times in size, and coped with the traumatic and difficult Tylenol poisoning episodes.    In getting the top posts, Mr. Larsen edged out two other top executives the company said it had been grooming for top management -- Robert E. Campbell, 55, head of the professional products sector, and Robert N. Wilson, 48, head of the pharmaceutical products area. Both Mr. Campbell and Mr. Wilson were named vice chairmen, and will be part of a new &quot;office of the chairman.&quot; They will continue to head their respective areas.    Succeeding Mr. Larsen as head of the roughly $3.5 billion consumer products segment, which last year accounted for 42% of Johnson andamp; Johnson's sales and 26% of its profit, will be Pierre J. Dupasquier, currently a company group chairman in charge of domestic personal products for feminine hygiene.    The changes take effect at the annual meeting next April 26. At the same time, the company will drop the position of president, currently held by David R. Clare, 63. Messrs. Burke and Mr. Clare will remain with the company and stand for re-election to the board in 1989. Mr. Burke will become chairman of the strategic planning committee and Mr. Clare will head the finance committee. They will retire in 1990.    Analysts generally welcomed the choice of Mr. Larsen. &quot;He's a real strategic thinker,&quot; said Gene Gargiulo, vice president of equity research at First Boston Corp. in New York. &quot;He knows how to be a low-cost producer in a high-quality product,&quot; Mr. Gargiulo said. &quot;In terms of delivering consistent earnings gains, he's the guy that's gonna do it,&quot; he added.    The selection of Mr. Larsen over the other two contenders wasn't a case of &quot;one doing better than the other,&quot; said David Lothson, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. He speculated that choosing Mr. Larsen, who is following Mr. Burke's path from the consumer products division, &quot;might've been a function of his more fully&quot; understanding all aspects of the business.    Both Messrs. Campbell and Wilson got high marks for their performance in their respective divisions. Because their divisions are more research intensive, the company might have decided to keep them where they are, said Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;Pharmaceuticals and professional sectors are highly specialized. . .; they're the areas where you would least want to disrupt the management&quot; because of the large number of research projects involved, Mr. Abramowitz said.    &quot;I certainly don't look at this as a spear fight in the corporate executive suite,&quot; Mr. Lothson said.    Mr. Larsen, only the fifth chairman in the company's 102-year history, joined Johnson andamp; Johnson as a manufacturing trainee in 1962, and became vice president of marketing for the McNeil consumer products company in 1980. He left the company for two years to serve as president of Becton Dickinson andamp; Co.'s consumer products division. He returned to Jandamp;J in 1983, and in 1986 was named vice chairman of the executive committee, chairman of the consumer sector, and a director.    Mr. Larsen said he expects no major change in the direction of the company, which he called &quot;the most diverse health-care company in the world.&quot; Among the company's emerging products, some analysts cited Retin-A, a long-time acne remedy drawing attention as a wrinkle cream; Sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener, and Erythropoietin, an anti-anemia compound. Mr. Larsen agreed they are &quot;very important opportunities,&quot; but added that &quot;we have a great many new product activities in place.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
