Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Carlucci took a decidedly different line than his predecessor and longtime mentor, Caspar Weinberger, who has continued planning for a buildup and criticized Congress for refusing to provide the funds to support it.    Throughout his testimony, Mr. Carlucci, who is currently the president's national security adviser, seemed reconciled to the reality that budget pressures have ended the Reagan military buildup. Early in his confirmation hearings, he conceded that the Pentagon's current spending plans &quot;are much higher than the Congress seems likely to approve.&quot;    According to estimates by budget analysts inside the Pentagon, the department's five-year budget plan may be as much as $400 billion out of whack.    Acknowledging that the military will have fewer funds than Mr. Weinberger's planners had assumed, Mr. Carlucci said he might favor a reduction in the size of the military, depending on how deep the budget cuts turn out to be. &quot;I don't think anything is sacrosanct,&quot; he said. &quot;We may well be talking about a smaller military force. I would rather have a smaller force that's effective, with the right equipment and training, than a larger force that's not.&quot;    Mr. Carlucci said he opposed pulling U.S. soldiers out of Europe. Any initial savings from such a move would be lost, he explained, because the Pentagon would have to build new airlift and sealift capacity so it could haul troops back into Europe in a crisis.    The secretary-designate also said he might depart from a past Pentagon policy of absorbing budget cuts by stretching out weapons programs rather than canceling any. Current budget realities &quot;mean terminating some programs to fund others more fully,&quot; he said. Other new weapons projects might be delayed, he added.    The Pentagon nominee hinted the administration might drop plans to move one costly new project -- the single-warhead Midgetman missile -- into production. He said the weapon would be the country's second land-based mobile missile. The other, the MX missile, under a recent Pentagon plan could be based on rail cars and travel the nation's rail system during crises.    Mr. Carlucci didn't rule out canceling programs that already are in production, but he didn't give any specific examples.    In response to a question, Mr. Carlucci said he didn't see any hopes of disengaging from the Pentagon's costly operations in the Persian Gulf. He said the administration will push for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, backed by an international arms embargo against violators. Otherwise, the naval forces should remain &quot;to help our friends stem the tide of Shiite expansionism,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
