KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress paid tribute to the nation's 17thRepublican president on Friday but 46 of the 59 House and Senatemembers lifting crystal champagne glasses to toast the newlyinaugurated George Bush were not GOP loyalists but oppositionDemocrats.   Both the House and Senate have Democratic majorities. But theheavy tilt of the inaugural luncheon guest list suggested an effortby the new president to reach out to the opposition, just as he saidhe would do in his inaugural address minutes before.   It is the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the firstAmerican president and a large early oil portrait of GeorgeWashington hung immediately behind Bush's chair at the main table inhistoric Statuary Hall.   An ensemble from the Smithsonian Institution, all of them playingantique instruments, performed light 18th century airs, all of whichare known to have been played for Washington.   Orchids, roses, poppies and other flowers spilled from vases seton white fluted columns to the side and in the center of each table.   Seated at tables of 10 each were members of Congress, Bush'sdesignated Cabinet nominees, and other officials and their spouses.   The menu: lobster scallop ragout, grilled poussin, four grainpilaf, asparagus, brandied pear crisp and vanilla ice cream,reported to be Bush's favorite dessert.   When lunch was done, the toasts were in order.   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the congressional inaguralarrangements committee, noted that in a room down the hall 25 ofBush's grandchildren and the children of others in attendance weredining with far less elegance _ but perhaps with as muchsatisfaction.   Their menu: grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken nuggets, freshfruit and milk.   ``I have checked, Mr. President, and at their luncheon, there wasno talk of politics,'' Ford said.   He then raised his glass of Korbel California champagne andoffered a toast: ``To your good health and long life with your ladyat your side.''   Bush sprang to his feet in response, calling his inaugural ``thepeople's day'' and noting that when the House sergeant-at-arms had,a few moments earlier, addressed him as ``Mr. President,'' he hadnot responded, thinking the remarks were addressed to formerPresident Reagan.   He was soon restored to reality.   ``I felt something between an affectionate hug and a kidneypunch,'' he said.   Then he explained, using a familiar nickname for hissilver-haired wife, Barbara: ``It was the silver fox telling me toget going.''   ``No politics today,'' Bush said, turning serious. ``This isgoing to be a very special day for the country. It's a wonderful wayto start this presidency.''   He then toasted the House and the Senate.   It was an occasion of gift-giving and Bush got four and VicePresident Dan Quayle got one.   Two large mahogany boxes were carried in by waiters in black tieand white gloves and opened to reveal two crystal bowls, hand carvedwith an etching of the Capitol dome on one side, an arbor of cherrytrees on the other.   Bush was presented the larger version, Quayle got the smaller.   ``Just don't drop it please,'' Ford said as the presentation toBush was made.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois presented Bushwith a plaque on which was mounted one of the letter openers whichopened the envelopes containing the electoral vote giving Bush andQuayle a total of 426 electoral votes and victory.   Michel also presented Bush with an engraved portrait of MartinVan Buren, the last sitting vice president until Bush to be electeddirectly from the vice presidency to the presidency.   Then it was the turn of House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas,offering a memento of historic significance.   Wright's plaque contained two charred bits of wood, one from theCapitol, one from the White House, with an inscription identifyingthem as parts of the fabric of those buildings burned by Britishraiders on the evening of Aug. 24, 1814.   And he presented it with a description of the commander of theBritish forces, ``climbing with muddy boots in the speaker'schair,'' and offering a mock resolution to his roistering soldiers:``Resolved, that this harbor of Yankee democracy shall be burned.''   The inscription on the plaque reads in part: ``Like these greatAmerican institutions, men too can be hammered and forged andultimately strengthened in fire and adversity.   ``In war and in peace in his tireless service both in thelegislative and executive branches of our government, President Bushhas been tested and tempered and shaped and made strong, inexperience and dedication, for the momentous duties he undertakestoday.''</TEXT></DOC>
