The one-dimensional chemical diffusion model computesthe concentrations of 36 atmospheric constituents using the newest photochemicaldata. In the radiative-convective part of the model besides CO/sub 2/,H/sub 2/O, and O/sub 3/ the effects of the trace gases CH/sub 4/, N/sub2/O, CF/sub 2/Cl/sub 2/ and CFCl/sub 3/ on the infrared radiation budgetare calculated by a detailed radiative transfer scheme. A more importantimprovement in this model, however, is the coupling with a simple ocean-model,to account for the timelag in the greenhouse effect induced temperatureincrease in the lower atmosphere due to heat transfer into the ocean.With a model version specially developed for the tropics it is studied,how altitude and temperature of the tropopause might be changed by theinfluence of anthropogenic gases. The consequences of these changes forstratospheric water vapor content, which plays a significant role incatalytic ozone destruction, are analysed.</TEXT></DOC>
