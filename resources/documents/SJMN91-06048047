Even more distressing, they say, is theappearance of a strain of the disease that is resistant to anti-TB drugs.;   The 1990 U.S. tuberculosis count stands at 23,720, with 1,000 or more casereports still likely to come in, according to Dr. Dixie Snider, chief of theTB division at the Centers for Disease Control.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TUBERCULOSIS RISE IN 1990 'DISTURBING'  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     That leaves the preliminary 1990 count already higher than the final countof 23,495 cases in 1989. And 1989 was bad enough, with a 5 percent increase inthe chronic lung disease, the biggest jump in TB since the CDC began countingin 1953.;    &quot;It's obviously disturbing,&quot; Snider said in a recent interview.&quot;It's completely unprecedented in what tuberculosis has actually been doingsince the last century.&quot;;    What TB had been doing, for the most part, wasgoing down. The disease affected millions before drugs to combat it weredeveloped about 30 years ago.;    Effective drug treatment sent TB ratesdeclining sharply. But the human immunodeficiency virus -- which cripples theimmune system and causes AIDS -- has triggered a turnaround that healthofficials are trying to stop.;    While most people who become infected withthe TB germ will never become ill with the disease -- and millions in Americaare in that category -- people whose immune systems are weakened by the HIVvirus are more susceptible to tuberculosis.;    Health officials estimate that1 million or more Americans are infected with HIV.;    Adding to the problem,Snider said, is the apparent increase in drug-resistant TB -- strains of TBthat have developed resistance to the most common anti-TB drugs.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Atlanta  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910217  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  281  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 17, 199100048047,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
