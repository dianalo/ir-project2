A Justice Ministry official said the new constitution to beenacted by Parliament will guarantee independent parties the rightto exist, but the first open elections under the charter will not beheld until 1995.   Party officials also are preparing to sponsor an East-Westconference in Budapest of Christian Democrat, Liberal, Socialist andCommunist parties to discuss the concept of a ``common Europe.''   Janos Berecz, secretary for ideology, told reporters after aCentral Committee meeting about 3,000 members left the party duringthe recent debate over the 1956 Hungarian revolt.   Imre Pozsgay, a reformer and member of the ruling Politburo,caused controversy by saying the revolt, crushed by the Soviets, wasa popular uprising, not a counterrevolution as in the officialversion.   He based his assessment on a report of a party committeereviewing Hungary's postwar history. A subsequent Central Committeesession issued a statement saying the revolt began as a popularuprising but became a counterrevolution.   Tuesday's meeting adopted a manifesto that appears designed toinform and reassure rank-and-file party members who have becomeconfused about widely publicized political and economic reforms at atime of inflation, declining living standards and a rising deficit.   Berecz told the Central Committee reform was the only course forHungary. ``We (Communists) have no other alternative because, duringthe elections, the nation will decide in favor of the party ofconsistent reforms in their own interests,'' he declared.   He said the party's membership might continue to decline but itwould gain new meaning for the public by professing the values offreedom, justice and solidarity.   ``We should expect that the ... competition of the variouspolitical movements will impose an encouraging or even compellingforce on us,'' he said of alternative parties and groups organizedin recent months.   Many of those hope to win seats in Parliament when themultiple-party system becomes reality.   Geza Kileni of the Justice Ministry told journalists the newconstitution, to be submitted to a referendum next year, will notmean open politics immediately and that the transition ``could lastseveral years.''   He said the first parliamentary elections based on the newcharter would be in 1995, but a multiple-party system would beestablished before that.   Trade unions, interest groups and possibly others will be allowedto enter candidate in next year's elections but the rules have notbeen determined, he said.   Party spokesman Laszlo Major said the conference on a ``commonEurope'' should be held in early summer and that 22 parties fromEast and West would be represented, including the Liberals andProgressive Conservatives of Canada and the U.S. Democratic Party.   He said only parties from the Soviet Union, Poland and Yugoslaviawould attend from Eastern Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
