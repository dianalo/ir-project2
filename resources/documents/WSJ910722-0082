But, others warn, it could also be a signal that the U.S.recovery isn't going to be as strong as many expected andthat the dollar has run out of steam. Avinash Persaud, aneconomist at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew, goes as far as calling it a&quot;decisive turn&quot; that will take the dollar into a steepdecline.</LP><TEXT>   In late New York trading Friday, the dollar fell to 1.7475marks from 1.7755 marks late Thursday, and to 136.40 yen from137.65 yen late Thursday. Sterling rose to $1.6945 from$1.6645.   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at136.18 yen, down from Tokyo's Friday close of 137.10 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7428 marks,down from 1.7633 marks Friday.   Much of the dollar's course over the near term will dependon how many market players agree with the confidence in aU.S. upturn expressed by the leaders of the Group of Sevenmajor industrialized countries when they met here last week.   Senior British officials, privy to the discussions, notedthe confidence was strong enough to allow the leaders to cometo easy and swift agreement on policy aims for growth andprice stability.   But, as they were talking, the dollar was experiencing itsheaviest correction since the start of the year on fears thatthe U.S. bounce will be a lot slower that initially forecast.   &quot;The market is having to adjust to the view that the U.S.economy is not coming out of recession as quickly as wethought,&quot; said David Cocker, a Treasury adviser at ChemicalBank in London.   Mr. Cocker forecasts the correction could push the dollardown to its next objective at 1.7300 marks given the recentweight of retail and institutional selling.   But, he also notes, predictions that the eventual strengthof the U.S. economy will push the dollar as high as two markslater this year, and beyond that level next year, remain inplace.   If anything, Mr. Cocker suggests, the current correctionis helping to reinforce the dollar's underlying reserves forthe assault. Before this, he noted, the dollar had lookedoverstretched and tired and its ability to climb anadditional 20 or 30 pfennigs was more in doubt.   Takashi Kanagami, chief Treasury manager at MitsubishiTrust andamp; Banking in London, reckons the dollar will only fallas far as 1.7500 marks. &quot;The adjustment is almost over,&quot; hesaid.   However, he forecasts that the threat of higher Europeaninterest rates later this year and renewed fears ofcoordinated central bank intervention will keep bullishdollar sentiment in check and prevent it from rising muchabove 1.85 marks during the rest of the year.   Mr. Persaud of UBS agrees that intervention fears willplay a new, increased role in curbing the dollar. He said theG-7 meeting, combined with coordinated intervention on July12, which pushed the dollar about four pfennigs lower, showedthere is &quot;a new spirit of cooperation&quot; among governments andcentral banks.   Before this, speculation over diverging policies in themajor economies, combined with an apparent reluctance by theU.S. Federal Reserve to join intervention exercises againstthe dollar, had given the market a strong signal thatintervention would be largely ineffectual.   Apart from this new fear of intervention, and thedisappointment over the pace of the U.S. recovery, the dollaris also likely to suffer from increased interest in the mark.The German Bundesbank continues to underline the need for afirm interest rate policy while the G-7 meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev last week helped to increase theprospect of Western help for the Soviet Union's beleagueredeconomy and decrease the threat of a refugee invasion ofGermany.   &quot;The accord helped to spread the burden of the problems ofEastern Europe away from Germany,&quot; Mr. Persaud said.   But Mr. Cocker of Chemical warns against over-optimism.&quot;This sentiment will prevail until we get another piece ofnegative news from the Soviet Union, such as more unrest inthe Baltic republics,&quot; he said.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $370.60 an ounce, up 40 cents.Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $370.65 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
