(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Bob Martinez on Friday ordered anabortion clinic closed following reports of botched abortions anddirected a state agency to come up with tougher rules to protectwomen at private clinics.   Martinez denied he was using the situation to enact emergencyregulations on abortion just weeks before the Legislature takes upthe issue in special session.   ``This is a pure pro-health issue,'' Martinez said. ``This is forthe health of individuals irregardless of philosophy on thesubstance of the abortion issue.''   Yet in a letter to Health and Rehabilitative Services SecretaryGreg Coler, the Republican governor said conditions at the Miamiclinic ``are precisely why I have called for increased regulation ofabortion clinics to protect the health of women.''   Martinez told Coler to begin steps to revoke the license of theWomen's Service Center following a report in The Miami Herald aboutimproper abortions by unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptureduteri and hysterectomies.   ``There is no legal reason, no health reason, for this order,''said Susan Hoffman, director of the center. ``We've done nothingagainst the law. We've helped thousands of women. I see this astotally ludicrous.''   She said she had received no official notice from the agency on alicense revocation.   Peter Dunbar, the governor's general counsel, said any emergencyregulations would be in effect for 90 days. After that, the ruleswould be subject to public hearings and Health and RehabilitativeServices board approval to become permanent.   By that time, the Legislature will have decided whether to goalong with Martinez's proposals to further restrict access toabortions. The session is scheduled for Oct. 10-13.   Neither Martinez nor Dunbar would be specific about the kinds ofregulations being sought. But both said they would be designed toprotect the health of women seeking abortions, not to restrict theiraccess to an abortion at any of the 47 licensed private clinics inthe state.   ``We're going to look at creatively working under the authorityof the existing statute and do as much as we can to fit that,''Dunbar said.   A pro-choice Republican legislator, Rep. Carol Hanson, said shesupports the governor's action as long as it is not extreme.   ``There's a whole conglomeration of standards that ... we couldlive with. We owe it to our sisters around the state to have safeabortions,'' she said. ``We think abortion should remain legal, butthey should also be safe.''</TEXT></DOC>
