More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes,mainly in the northeast, as rain-swollen rivers overflowed theirbanks and swept through villages and farmlands, the reports said.   They said the latest deaths occurred Sunday in the northeasterndistrict of Hobiganj, the northwestern districts of Gaibandha,Kurigram and Jamalpur, and the central districts of Netrokona andComilla.   Most of the town of Barahmanbaria, 50 miles east of Dhaka, wasunder three feet of water and crops over a large surrounding areawere damaged or destroyed, according to officials, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   They said army troops were performing large scale rescueoperations, but many areas remain inaccessible because bridges areflooded and there is not enough dry land for helicopters to land.   Road and railway traffic between Dhaka and northeasterndistricts today remain blocked for the seventh day because manybridges and rail crossings are submerged.   The waters of the Brahmaputra and Jammu rivers, which rose aboveflood levels, rushed into neighboring India, the reports said.   In northeastern India, seven people died in flooding in Assamstate and more than 3,000 families were left stranded in Tripurastate, Indian news agencies reported today.   Floods are an annual threat in this country of 105 millionpeople with heavy monsoon rains, which are essential for thecountry's rice crop. Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in theworld, does not have the funds to build dams that would hold backthe flood waters.   Last year, in the worst flooding in 70 years, some 25 millionpeople were driven out of their homes and more than 1,200 died.   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad flew over flood-affected areason Sunday. Later, at an emergency Cabinet meeting, he orderedgovernment officials to personally supervise the relief operations.</TEXT></DOC>
