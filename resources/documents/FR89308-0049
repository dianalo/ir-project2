Except as otherwise noted in the additional supplementaryinformation, the regulations state that new construction or alterationaccomplished in accordance with the ``American National Standard Specificationsfor Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to, and Usable by, the PhysicallyHandicapped'' published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.(ANSI A117.1-1961 (R1971) (ANSI)) meets the requirements of section 504.Three agencies (the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental ProtectionAgency, and the Small Business Administration) reference the 1980 edition,ANSI A117.1-1980. The proposed revision set forth in this document willreference UFAS in place of the current standard.On August 7, 1984, UFAS was issued by the four agencies establishing standardsunder the Architectural Barriers Act (49 FR 31528 (see discussion <T3>infra</T3>)). The Department of Justice (DOJ), as the agency responsibleunder Executive Order 12250 for coordinating the enforcement of section504, has recommended that agencies amend their section 504 regulationsfor federally assisted programs or activities to establish that, with respectto new construction and alterations, compliance with UFAS shall be deemedto be compliance with section 504. Because some facilities subject to newconstruction or alteration requirements under section 504 are also subjectto the Architectural Barriers Act, governmentwide reference to UFAS willdiminish the possibility that recipients of Federal financial assistancewould face conflicting enforcement standards. In addition, reference toUFAS by all Federal funding agencies will reduce potential conflicts whena building is subject to the section 504 regulations of more than one Federalagency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background of Accessibility Standards </ITAG>The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, requires certainFederal and federally funded buildings to be designed, constructed, andaltered in accordance with accessibility standards. It also designatesfour agencies (the General Services Administration, the Departments ofDefense, and Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Postal Service)to prescribe the accessibility standards. Section 502 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 established the Architectural and Transportation Barriers ComplianceBoard (ATBCB). In 1978 the Rehabilitation Act was amended to require theATBCB, <T3>inter alia, </T3>to issue minimum guidelines and requirements for thestandards to be issued by the four standard-setting agencies. The minimumguidelines were published on August 4, 1982 (47 FR 33862), and are codifiedat 36 CFR Part 1190.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The ATBCB Office of Technical Services is available toprovide technical assistance to recipients upon request relating to theelimination of architectural barriers. Its address is: U.S. ATBCB, Officeof Technical Services, 1111 18th Street, NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC20036. The telephone number is (202) 653-7834 [voice/TDD]. This is nota toll free number. On August 7, 1984, the four standard-setting agencies issued UFAS as aneffort to minimize the differences among their Barriers Act standards,and among those standards and accessibility standards used by the privatesector. The General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD) have incorporated UFAS into their BarriersAct regulations (<T3>see </T3>41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6 (GSA) and 24 CFR Part 40   (HUD)).In order to ensure uniformity, UFAS was designed to be consistent withthe scoping and technical provisions of the ATBCB's minimum guidelinesand requirements, as well as with the technical provisions of ANSI A117.1-1980.ANSI is a private, national organization that publishes recommended standardson a wide variety of subjects. The original ANSI A117.1 was adopted in1961 and reaffirmed in 1971. The current edition, issued in 1986, is ANSIA117.1-1986. The 1961, 1980, and 1986 ANSI standards are frequently usedin private practice and by State and local governments. This proposed amendment would amend the agencies' section 504 regulationsto refer to UFAS. The agencies have determined that they will not require the use of UFAS,or any other standard, as the sole means by which recipients can achievecompliance with the requirement that new construction and alterations beaccessible. To do so would unnecessarily restrict recipients' ability todesign for particular circumstances. In addition, it might create conflictswith State or local accessibility requirements that may also apply to recipients'buildings and that are intended to achieve ready access and use. It isexpected that in some instances recipients will be able to satisfy thesection 504 new construction and alteration requirements by following applicableState or local codes, and vice versa. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of Amendment </ITAG>Except as otherwise noted in the additional supplementary information forindividual agencies, the agencies' current section 504 rules require thatnew facilities be designed and constructed to be readily accessible toand usable by persons with handicaps and that alterations be accessibleto the maximum extent feasible. The amendment would not affect the currentrequirement but would merely provide that compliance with UFAS with respectto buildings (as opposed to ``facilities,'' a broader term that encompassesbuildings as well as other types of property) shall be deemed compliancewith these requirements with respect to those buildings. Thus, for example,an alteration is accessible ``to the maximum extent feasible'' if it isdone in accordance with UFAS. It should be noted that UFAS contains specialrequirements for alterations where meeting the general standards wouldbe impracticable or infeasible (<T3>see, e.g.,</T3> UFAS sections 4.1.6(1)(b), 4.1.6(3), 4.1.6(4), and4.1.7). The amendment also includes language providing that departures from particularUFAS technical and scoping requirements are permitted so long as the alternativemethods used will provide substantially equivalent or greater access toand utilization of the building. Allowing these departures from UFAS willprovide recipients with necessary flexibility to design for special circumstancesand will facilitate the application of new technologies that are not specifiedin UFAS. As explained under ``Background of Accessibility Standards,''the agencies anticipate that compliance with some provisions of applicableState and local accessibility requirements will provide ``substantiallyequivalent'' access. In some circumstances, recipients may choose to usemethods specified in model building codes or other State or local codesthat are not necessarily applicable to their buildings but that achievesubstantially equivalent access. The amendment requires that the alternative methods provide ``substantially''equivalent or greater access, in order to clarify that the alternativeaccess need not be precisely equivalent to that afforded by UFAS. Applicationof the ``substantially equivalent access'' language will depend on thenature, location, and intended use of a particular building. Generally,alternative methods will satisfy the requirement if in material respectsthe access is substantially equivalent to that which would be providedby UFAS in such respects as safety, convenience, and independence of movement.For example, it would be permissible to depart from the technical requirementof UFAS section 4.10.9 that the inside dimensions of an elevator car beat least 68 inches or 80 inches (depending on the location of the door)on the door opening side, by 54 inches, if the clear floor area and theconfiguration of the car permits wheelchair users to enter the car, makea 360anddegrees; turn, maneuver within reach of controls, and exit from thecar. This departure is permissible because it results in access that issafe, convenient, and independent, and therefore substantially equivalentto that provided by UFAS. With respect to UFAS scoping requirements, it would be permissible in somecircumstances to depart from the UFAS new construction requirement of oneaccessible principal entrance at each grade floor level of a building (seeUFAS section 4.1.2(8)), if safe, convenient, and independent access isprovided to each level of the new facility by a wheelchair user from anaccessible principal entrance. This departure would not be permissibleif it required an individual with handicaps to travel an extremely longdistance to reach the spaces served by the inaccessible entrances or otherwiseprovided access that was substantially less convenient than that whichwould be provided by UFAS.It would not be permissible for a recipient to depart from UFAS' requirementthat, in new construction of a long-term care facility, at least 50% ofall patient <T3>bedrooms </T3>be accessible (see UFAS section 4.1.4(9)(b)), by usinglarge accessible wards that make it possible for 50% of all <T3>beds </T3>in the facility to be accessible to individuals with handicaps.The result is that the population of individuals with handicaps in thefacility will be concentrated in large wards, while able-bodied personswill be concentrated in smaller, more private rooms. Because conveniencefor persons with handicaps is therefore compromised to such a great extent,the degree of accessibility provided to persons with handicaps is not substantiallyequivalent to that intended to be afforded by UFAS. It should be noted that the amendment does not require that existing buildingsleased by recipients meet the standards for new construction and alterations.Rather, it continues the current Federal practice under section 504 oftreating newly leased buildings as subject to the program accessibilitystandard for existing facilities. Buildings under design on the effective date of this amendment will begoverned by the amendment if the date that bids were invited falls afterthe effective date. This interpretation is consistent with GSA's ArchitecturalBarriers Act regulation incorporating UFAS, at 41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6.The proposed revision includes language modifying the effect of UFAS section4.1.6(1)(g), which provides an exception to UFAS 4.1.6, <T3>Accessible buildings: Alterations. </T3>Section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFASstates that ``mechanical rooms and other spaces which normally are notfrequented by the public or employees of the building or facility or whichby nature of their use are not required by the Architectural Barriers Actto be accessible are excepted from the requirements of 4.1.6.'' Particularlyafter the development of specific UFAS provisions for housing alterationsand additions, UFAS section 4.1.6(1)(g) could be read to exempt alterationsto privately owned residential housing, which is not covered by the ArchitecturalBarriers Act unless leased by the Federal Government for subsidized housingprograms. This exception, however, is not appropriate under section 504,which protects beneficiaries of housing provided as part of a federallyassisted program. Consequently, the proposed amendment provides that, forpurposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpretedto exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and otherspaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibilityto the public or beneficiaries, or result in the employment or residencetherein of persons with handicaps. The proposed revision also provides that whether or not the recipient optsto follow UFAS in satisfaction of the ready access requirement, the recipientis not required to make building alterations that have little likelihoodof being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structuralmember. This provision does not relieve recipients of their obligationunder the current regulation to ensure program accessibility. Several agencies' section 504 regulations for federally assisted programsare contained in parts entitled ``Nondiscrimination on the basis of handicapin programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financialassistance.'' This document deletes the phrase ``or benefiting from'' fromthose titles. The phrase is being deleted pursuant to <T3>Department of Transportation </T3>v. <T3>Paralyzed Veterans of America, </T3>477 U.S. 597 (1986), which heldthat air transportation services provided by airlines were not part ofthe covered program or activity because the airlines were not the intendedrecipient of the Federal financial assistance to airports, even if theairlines benefited from that assistance. The recent passage of the CivilRights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-259, does not overrule or alterthis result. S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., lst Sess. 29 (1987).
