They are scheduled to meet with senior Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the central bank governor, Satoshi Sumita, as well as the heads of Japan's major banks and securities firms.    The trip points up how the U.S.-Japan trade dispute has spilled over into the financial-services sector. Some major Wall Street firms and a growing number of U.S. lawmakers believe that the only way to force Tokyo to open its relatively closed financial markets to foreign competitors is to threaten to restrict Japan's financial institutions in U.S. markets.    To that end, the House trade bill, which is scheduled for full debate the week of April 27, contains a provision that would bar Japanese financial institutions from being primary dealers in U.S. government securities until U.S. firms are granted full reciprocity in Tokyo markets.    Last December, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added the U.S. units of Nomura Securities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co. to its list of primary dealers -- an elite group of 40 institutions that deals directly with the New York Fed when the Fed buys and sells securities as part of its domestic open-market operations. In addition, a U.S. unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. won approval to acquire primary dealer Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co.    Making the seven-day trip to Tokyo are Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, and three representatives: Charles E. Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Bruce A. Morrison (D., Conn.) -- both members of the House Banking Committee -- plus George Miller (D., Calif.), who is a member of the House Budget Committee.    Mr. Schumer said he intends to tell the Japanese &quot;of the frustration Congress has over how closed the Japanese markets are, given the sophistication of Japan.&quot; He added that Congress would prefer not to use retaliatory legislation, but added: &quot;Talking does very little good.&quot;    Mr. Schumer added: &quot;The American financial-services industry is the best in the world. The question is, will it remain number one? And, more importantly, number one on a level playing field.&quot;    Prodded by Washington, Tokyo has been steadily deregulating markets during the past few years. Six foreign firms, including four U.S. concerns, are members of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Several U.S. houses have been granted securities licenses, and U.S. banks may soon get them. And nine foreign banks, including six U.S. ones, have been granted licenses to offer trust-banking services that allow them to manage pension funds.    But U.S. institutions, especially investment banks, want more. According to Deryck C. Maughan, a managing director in charge of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Tokyo branch, U.S. firms want more seats on Tokyo's exchange and the right to trade foreign currency, which is something Japanese securities firms can't do, either. They also want greater participation in the primary issue of Japanese government 10-year bonds, where Tokyo does about 85% of its funding.    Japan issues its long-term bonds to a syndicate controlled by Japanese banks and securities firms. The syndicate managers, in turn, allocate securities to other members. Bank and insurance companies are awarded 75.8% of an underwriting and securities firms get 24.2%. A week ago, the Finance Ministry raised -- to 23 from 17 -- the number of foreign securities firms allowed in its underwriting syndicate. That boosted the foreign firms' overall allocation to 5.73% of any issue from 1.19%.    &quot;It's a step in the right direction, but at this pace it will take 50 years to get what we want,&quot; said Eugene D. Atkinson, president of Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. in Tokyo. &quot;My two-month-old baby takes longer steps.&quot;    U.S. investment bankers contend that Tokyo is hurting itself by relying so heavily on commercial banks. Mr. Maughan noted the advantages of the broad distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe of a firm such as Salomon Brothers.    &quot;We believe in the auction system; we believe in the free market,&quot; said Mr. Atkinson, adding that Japan could raise funds on the bond market more cheaply through an auction. He is supported by Nomura and Daiwa Securities, which believe they could hold their own against the banks in any auction sale.    Observers pointed to Salomon's success in recent auctions of short-term Japanese government notes as an example of foreign firms' potential contributions. In January, the firm captured 41% of a two-year auction and, on Tuesday, 21% of a four-year auction. Other U.S. firms won smaller amounts, but Nikko Securities Co., Japan's second-largest securities company, didn't capture any.    In addition, both Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. have asked that their respective London-based banks be granted representative offices in Tokyo, something that would allow them to conduct foreign exchange. &quot;Not being able to trade currencies inhibits U.S. firms' ability to fully service their customers,&quot; said Mark Lerner, head of Merrill Lynch's Japan banking group in New York.    Some bankers worry that too much &quot;Japan bashing&quot; could trigger a backlash and lose U.S. firms some of their hard-won gains. But one U.S. executive complained that Washington should be pushing more. &quot;We want {Treasury Secretary James A.} Baker to take an initiative; the lack of U.S. interest is deafening,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
