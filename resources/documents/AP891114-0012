The convict, identified as Stoney Harrison, 25, ran from thescene, according to Police Commissioner Richard Condon.   Around midnight, about 10 hours later, police brought in forquestioning a man believed to be Harrison, who was found in a homein the borough of Brooklyn, said police Sgt. Pete Berry.   Killed were Detectives Keith L. Williams, 34, of New York Cityand Richard J. Guerzon, 46, of Merrick, said Sgt. RaymondO'Donnell, a police spokesman.   The shooting, the first to claim the lives of two city policeofficers in more than 11 years, occurred on the Grand CentralParkway in the borough of Queens, near LaGuardia Airport.   The detectives had driven Harrison from the city's Rikers Islandjail to the Queens district attorney's office earlier in the day totake a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, police said.He was being taken back to Rikers in one of the detectives'personal cars when the shooting occurred.   Condon said both officers carried pistols in ankle holsters, butneither had been fired. The weapon with which they were shot wasnot recovered, and Condon said it was unclear where Harrison got agun.   The seating of detectives and inmate _ them in front, him alonein back _ violated procedure, Condon said. Police said it was notagainst police guidelines to transport prisoners in personal cars.   Harrison was handcuffed when he was in the car, but was not whenhe fled, according to witnesses. A pair of cuffs was found in thefront seat.   Police said it appeared the car pulled over to the side of thehighway before shots were fired. Both detectives appeared to havebeen shot once in the back of the head.   Police said Harrison, a resident of Queens, has an extensivecriminal record dating to 1984, including drug and assault charges.In 1985, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail for biting off agirlfriend's ear.   He was arrested in July for allegedly strangling anothergirlfriend after a night of partying and drug-taking. In October,he and his mother were arrested for conspiring to murder a witnessagainst him in the July slaying. He allegedly had his mother offer$2,000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective.   Port Authority Police Officer Robert Schaefer said three menwere arrested near the airport shortly after Monday's shooting, buteach was released.   An hour after the shooting the detectives' bodies, in whitebags, were on grass near the parkway. The sedan they were drivingwas parked nearby. There were bullet holes in the windshield, andthe wipers were on.   Another car, its front end smashed, also sat in the road. PoliceCapt. Stephen Davis said the driver of the second car was notinvolved in the shooting. Westbound traffic on the parkway waslimited to one lane.   Officer Hugh Mulvey, the first officer on the scene, said hefound ``one police officer face down on the ground and the otherofficer on the passenger seat shot and killed.''   At least seven witnesses were being interviewed.   ``It was a pretty bloody scene,'' Schaefer said. Asked where theofficers had been shot, he said, ``There was so much blood it washard to tell.''   The officers were members of the Queens district attorney'sdetective squad, Schaefer said.   Williams, who leaves behind a wife and a daughter, was appointedto the Police Department in 1981 and earned two police awards.Guerzon, who had a wife and two children, was appointed in 1969 andearned 13 awards, O'Donnell said.   Rewards totaling $40,000 were offered for information leading tothe officers' killers: $10,000 from a group of city businessmancalled COPSHOT; $10,000 from the city; and $20,000 from theDetectives Endowment Association, which represents detectives.   The last time two police officers were killed in the sameincident was April 2, 1978. Officers Norman Cerullo and ChristieMasone were killed in a gunfight with two occupants of a car theystopped in Brooklyn.   The officers shot Monday became the fourth and fifth ones killedin the line of duty this year. Fourteen others have been wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
