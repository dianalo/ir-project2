<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1374 </DOCNO><TEXT>To investigate compression and heating of shell-type targets with highaspect ratios under the effect of six neodymium laser light beams withpower density making up 0.5-2x10/sup 14/ W/cm/sup 2/ a wide spectrumof diagnostic equipment is used. Compression rates for targets with differentaspect ratios are measured, effect of irradiation inhomogeneity on theachievable compression degree is evaluated, neutron yield at 10/sup 6/-10/sup7/ neutron level for glass target cylinder filled with gaseous deuteriumis recorded. 1 ref.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
