Byrd of West Virginia:   This is Senator Byrd. I have good news. Congress is one stepcloser to passing the long-awaited trade bill. Last Thursday, theHouse of Representatives did its part. The trade bill passedoverwhelmingly.   Now, it is our turn in the Senate. Next week we are going tosend the trade bill to the president for his signature.   The trade deficit has got to come down. America's standard ofliving is being threatened. There are more of us working, but fewerof us owning homes. In most families, it takes two people workingto keep the American dream in sight. And everyone is looking overtheir shoulders, worried about the next crash on Wall Street.   Year by year, we have slipped further into debt. The tradedeficit, like the budget deficit, is in triple digits. The tradedeficit is up again. That means fewer jobs for Americans.   With this trade bill America will be telling the world: ``Watchout, you've got competition.'' We will be telling the world thatAmerica expects fair competition: ``If you get access to ourmarkets, we get access to yours.''   The trade bill is a positive step for America. It is a goodbill. This bill creates programs for retraining workers, and givesthe president new tools to open up markets to American products. Itis not protectionist.   The trade bill is comprehensive. It covers everything fromexchange rates to better education for our children. The trade billestablishes a strong new export policy. At the same time, itprotects American inventions from piracy by foreign firms. Inaddition, this trade bill prevents foreign investors fromdominating industries vital to our national security.   This trade bill is a reasonable response to a trade policy thaths gone awry. It opens up new markets, invests in people and ideas,and creates new opportunities for American industries and workersto work together _ to make America competitive again.   We are at the 11th hour when it comes to dealing with ournation's trade deficit. This is no time to dilly-dally. America hasgot to get moving again. The trade bill gets us moving in the rightdirection.   But all this is at risk if the president vetoes the trade bill.Despite months of working with the president, the Congress is stillunsure of his support. The president is still waving his veto penin the air.   The president is upset that the trade bill includes one smallsection to protect workers from suddenly being laid off withoutnotice. That's the issue: the plant-closing legislation that youhave been hearing about.   Our bill says if your factory is going to close and you aregoing to lose your job, you have a right to know 60 days inadvance. That is simple justice, simple decency. Right now, manyworkers get only a week or two or a day or two of warning thattheir jobs are about to disappear. About a third of all Americanworkers get no notice at all.   The administration does not like this provision. I think theadministration is dead wrong. What they are saying is this: ``It isOK to give golden parachutes to the big guys, but it is not OK togive the little guy a warning that he is about to lose his job.''Is that fair? Of course not.   I have seen the impact of factories suddenly closing in my ownstate of West Virginia. Men and women who have loyally worked foryears for a company suddenly are handed pink slips without warning.``Go stand on the unemployment line. All your hard work does notcount.'' That's the message.   The choice is simple. If the president stands up for America, hewill sign the trade bill. There will be no veto. It will be a greatday. If the president vetoes the trade bill, he will be sendinganother message: The big boys with the golden parachutes count morethan the little guy.   Mr. President, at the 11th hour, don't turn back the clock. Weneed new policies, not old politics. Mr. President, put away yourveto pen and sign the trade bill when it comes to your desk.</TEXT></DOC>
