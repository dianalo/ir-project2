 But with every EISA-based systempitch from vendors was an equally fervent &quot;Where are the cards?&quot; (to supportEISA) query from a show attendee.andM;Representative new systems included the STEP 486 from Everex Computer SystemsDivision (Fremont, Calif.).andP;  The company is adding this top-of-line machineto its STEP family of 386-based computers.andP;  Copam USA (also of Fremont),unveiled a 386-based 33-MHz machine built around an EISA-spec bus.andP;  SanJose-based Fora Inc. debuted a line of laptops ranging from a 12-MHz 286 to16-MHz 386 ($3,495 to $5,055).andM;On the output side, QMS demonstrated the QMSScript PM10, which the companyclaims is the first color printer for both OS/2 Presentation Manager and DOSprinting applications.andP;  QMS says the printer controller features the firstPresentation Manager GPI design.andP;  The controller loads either GPI or DGIS tothe host computer's hard disk.andP;  Of course, PCL and HPGL emulation are alsoincluded.andM;As for power software, Quarterdeck Office Systems (Santa Monica, Calif.)andO;showed two new expanded memory managers (QRAM and Manifest) and demonstratedDESQview 2.26 and DESQview 386 to show that the DOS operating environment isvery much up to the rigors of multitasking and multi-windowing.andP;  Users canhave it today, they say, with as little horsepower as an 8088 CPU can muster.andM;Waiting for WindowsandM;Power-wielding hardware and software vendors flexed 386- and 486-basedmuscle, but it was the new applications that seemed to have attendees abuzz.andO;Grumblings from users indicated a relish for multitasking with OS/2 but atired-of-waiting attitude toward its late arrival.andP;  Windows 3.0, acting aswhat some in the industry call a &quot;bridge&quot; to OS/2, seemed more tangible thanthe promises of OS/2 and the Presentation Manager.andM;Software developers offered opinions on the importance of Windows as astandard GUI (graphical user interface) and the environment's relationship toOS/2's Presentation Manager.andM;&quot;What users have heard is that if Window 3.0 isn't the be-all and end-all,it's still going to be a pretty big breakthrough.andP;  The list of applicationsis growing, even though most of them are still in beta versions.andP;  The newversion will probably be the interface of choice for the common man for thenext five to seven years,&quot; predicted Duke Lane, vice president of sales andmarketing at Austin, Texas-based Precision, Inc.andM;Most developers point to the promised enhanced memory management that smashesthe 640K memory limitation in DOS as the big advancement over current Windowsversions.andP;  &quot;We think people who were hesitant to write Windows programs willbe more eager to go with Windows 3.0, because of a lot of things Microsoft ispromising.andP;  I've heard developers say [current versions] are still uglyenvironments,&quot; said Christel Van den Eynden, marketing manager at MatesysCorp. in Washington D.C.andM;One factor that may be preventing would-be Windows developers from climbingaboard is the cost required to write their GUI-based programs.andP;  &quot;It's a greatsystem, and it's great for the machine, but Windows costs three times as muchmoney to develop programs for than DOS because there are so many pieces ofcode,&quot; said Leland J. Ancier, president of Carlsbad, Calif.-based AtechSoftware.andM;As for OS/2, the consensus was that the operating system will be mostprominent in networking environments at the outset.andP;  Windows could be theso-called bridge to OS/2 because anyone writing programs to Windows 3.0 willbe &quot;way ahead of the PM developers,&quot; added Precision's Stein.andM;Considering the mumblings about an OS/2 version 2.0 that would provide a32-bit multitasking, multithreading operating system with no time slicingnecessary, Stein commented, &quot;Major corporations in the Fortune 2000[companies] will jump on it.&quot;andM;Who Was WhoandM;Products at the show ran the gamut, from word-processing and graphicssoftware to terminal emulation and relational database systems.andP;  Companiessuch as Corel Systems, Micrografx and Microsoft had existing applications upand running, but there were a handful of new announcements dotting the showas well.andP;  Matesys Corp. (Washington, D.C.), for example, rolled out two newadditions to the company's Objectseries software programming tools.andO;Objectscript ($150) is pitched as a &quot;hypercard-like toolkit&quot; for Windows.andP;  Agraphics editor lets users build screens with pop-up menus, icons, editboxes, list-boxes and tables.andP;  The program is based on a &quot;Quick Basic-likelanguage&quot; that lets users define scripts, execute commands and establishDynamic Data Exchange (DDE) links with Windows applications.andM;Objectview ($795) is an object-oriented tool for developing graphics-basedinterfaces which, in turn, allow users to develop SQL Server Applications.andO;&quot;Basically, it's a big batch language and integrator with the same basicfeatures in Objectview, but with access to a server,&quot; said Van den Eynden ofMatesys.andM;One feature of both programs the company likes to highlight is the capabilityto program graphic &quot;buttons&quot; anywhere on the screen.andP;  Activating the buttonwith a click of a mouse will trigger a series of events.andP;  For instance, &quot;oneof the buttons may load Excel and bring font data into a table, so it lookslike a mini spreadsheet,&quot; added Van den Eynden.andM;Text editing products are beginning to take advantage of Windows-basedsoftware.andP;  A couple of programs announced at the show use the environment tocut down keying by the user.andP;  Reference Software International (SanFrancisco, Calif.) showed Grammatik Windows ($99), which they claim is thefirst grammar and style checker for Windows.andP;  The product is slated forrelease on June 18.andP;  Company officials say a big plus for Windows users isthe capability for &quot;interactive editing, with which users can flip up a helpscreen and see that something is really a style problem.andP;  They may not haveto worry about style as much as they would a grammar problem,&quot; said SigridMetson, corporate communications manager at Reference.andM;Just over their shoulders, Solea Systems was showing TextManager 2.0, whichincludes a fax capability that allows users to compose a document, edit itand fax it under Windows.andP;  The program had been ready for shipment wellbefore the show, but Solea postponed it until the fax capability could beadded.andP;  &quot;A text editor/word processor alone isn't so exciting, so we addedfax.andP;  We felt that the program needed fax capabilities, because these days notext editor is complete without letting users fax documents,&quot; said NicholasStein, Solea's vice president.andP;  TextManager 2.0 will retail for $149.andM;Precision demonstrated Superbase 4, a user-progrmmable relational databasefor Windows that will ship in October.andP;  The software's development language,called DML, is referred to by the company as a &quot;BASIC-like language.&quot;andO;Network, runtime and nonprogrammable versions are also available.andM;Atech Software introduced Publisher's Powerpak for Windows ($79.95), whichprovides scalable fonts on any printer from within any Windows application.andO;The program supports more than 300 dot matrix, inkjet and laser printers attheir highest resolution with 30 typefaces from the three most popularfamilies, each scalable from 4 to 127 points.andM;This is merely a representative list of products shown at the exposition.andO;Overall, barely contained excitement and unbridled enthusiasm for theofficially unannounced Windows 3.0 was the atmosphere of the show.andP;  A Windowsexposition planned for this fall in Boston should be abuzz with 3.0applications and, hopefully, delivery on the many promises users have beenhearing for months.andM;(John Webster and Computer Currents/19900505)</TEXT></DOC>
