In theseapplications, there has been considerable controversy both about theconcept of discount rates and about what empirical values most accuratelyrepresent actual consumer behavior. Given the importance of implicitdiscount rates in some forecasting models and their widespread use inanalysis of the market potential of energy-related durables, EPRI RP-2547was designed to estimate the magnitude of discount rates for variousequipment choices and to evaluate their usefulness as a forecasting parameter.This report summarizes the results of two studies of the discount ratesimplicit in household decisions to install conservation measures andpurchase high efficiency appliances. The second study addressed applianceefficiency choices using data from a high efficiency appliance rebateprogram. This is summarized in this volume of the report.</TEXT></DOC>
