The commission said there was no need for a blanket requirementfor the changes, although it ordered a plant-by-plant study ofwhether hard pipe vents should be added to the containmentbuildings, known as Mark I and made by General Electric Co.   The vents would relieve severe pressure that would build up ifthe reactor core were damaged. A containment failure could lead tothe release of dangerous amounts of radioactivity into theatmosphere.   Anti-nuclear groups have urged the NRC to shut down plants withMark I containment buildings, saying they pose too great a risk topublic health and safety.   The NRC staff earlier this year recommended requiring the changesat all 24 plants _ about a quarter of the nation's nuclear powerstations.   The commission rejected that approach Wednesday, but said itwould require the hard pipe vents at any plant deemed by NRCanalysts to need them. It said the case-by-case approach shouldsettle the question for all 24 plants within three years.   The 24 plants were selected because their containment buildingsare believed to be more vulnerable to rupture during a severereactor accident than other containment systems.   The commission also said it would approve vents at any plantsthat voluntarily chose to install them. Few are expected to do itvoluntarily, although Boston Edison Co.'s Pilgrim plant has done so.   As a further precaution, the commission ordered its staff tospeed up implementation of an existing NRC requirement that a Mark Iplant be capable of withstanding a total loss of electrical powerwithout overheating the reactor.   Kenneth Boley, a nuclear expert for the Public Citizenenvironmental group, said the NRC was ``buying time'' for thenuclear industry by promising further study.   Robert Pollard, a nuclear engineer with the Union of ConcernedScientists, today called the decision ``a big punt'' that ``createsthe impression for the public that the NRC has done something whenthey've actually done nothing.''   Plant owners generally opposed a blanket requirement forimprovements to the Mark I containment system, saying they would notappreciably reduce the risk of rupture.   Of the 24 reactors with Mark I containments, five are notoperating. They are Philadelphia Electric Co.'s Peach Bottom No. 3,Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s Nine Mile Point No. 1, and theTennessee Valley Authority's Browns Ferry No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.   The remaining plants in the study, their location and owners are:   Brunswick, two reactors at Southport, N.C., Carolina Power andamp;Light Co.; Cooper, Brownsville, Neb., Nebraska Public PowerDistrict; Dresden, two reactors at Morris, Ill., Commonwealth EdisonCo.; Quad Cities, two reactors at Cordova, Ill., Commonwealth Edisonand Iowa Gas andamp; Electric Co.;   Duane Arnold, Palo, Iowa, Iowa Electric Light andamp; Power Co.; Fermi2, Laguna Beach, Mich., Detroit Edison Co.; James A.
