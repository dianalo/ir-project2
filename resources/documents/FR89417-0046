Background</ITAG>The threat of depletion of the ozone layer from chlorine released fromchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was first raised well over a decade ago by thescientific community. (Molina and Rowland 1974). The initial theory suggestedthat because CFCs are relatively inert, emissions of these chemicals wouldnot break down in the lower atmosphere, but would instead slowly migrateto the stratosphere where they would then break apart releasing chlorine.Once freed in the stratosphere, the chlorine would catalytically destroyozone. From a health and environmental perspective, depletion of the ozonelayer would allow more harmful ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the atmosphereand strike the earth's surface. This would increase the incidence of skincancers and cataracts, suppress the human immune system, damage crops,forests, and aquatic systems, accelerate weathering of certain plastics,and increase the formation of ground level (tropospheric) ozone or smog.In the fourteen years of research since the original theory was proposedconsiderable scientific evidence has supported the general concern thatincreased emissions of CFCs (and halons) would lead to ozone depletion.(See, for example, ``Present State of Knowledge of the Upper Atmosphere1988: An Assessment Report,'' National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA), andplusmin;1208, August 1988).In 1981, in response to the growing scientific consensus, the United NationsEnvironment Program (UNEP) began negotiations to develop a multilateralresponse to reducing the threat of ozone depletion. These negotiationsresulted in the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layerin March 1985. The convention provided a framework for international cooperationin research, monitoring, and information exchange. Further negotiationsresulted in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer. The Montreal Protocol was signed in September 1987 and requiresthe Parties to control or reduce their use of specified ozone-depletingchemicals. EPA promulgated regulations implementing the Protocol on August12, 1988. (See 52 FR 47486, December 14, 1987, and 53 FR 30566, August12, 1988). The conditions for the Protocol's entry-into-force were statisfiedin December 1988, and the Protocol and the EPA's rule went into effectJanuary 1, 1989.On the same day that the Agency issued its final rule implementing theMontreal Protocol, it also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPRM) on possible further efforts to protect stratospheric ozone (53FR 30604, August 12, 1988). Currently, the Montreal Protocol and the EPregulation require a 50 percent phase-in reduction in the production andconsumption of specified fully-halogenated CFCs by 1998, and a freeze at1986 levels of specified halons beginning in 1992. In the August ANPRMhowever, EPA described new scientific information which suggests that additionalreductions in CFCs, halons and possibly other ozone depleting chemicalsmay be necessary.This new scientific information along with other information is currentlybeing reviewed under Article 6 of the Protocol. Article 6 states that theParties (nations that have ratified the Protocol) will assess whether thecontrol measures, as provided for in Article 2 of the Protocol, are sufficientto meet the goals for reducing ozone depletion. According to Article 6,this assessment will include a review of the current state of knowledgeon technical, scientific, environmental and economic issues related tostratospheric ozone protection.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Today's Notice </ITAG>The Agency is beginning to prepare for a meeting of the Parties, scheduledto take place in April of 1990, at which the Parties will decide on changesto the protocol's control measures. Because of the new scientific informationsuggesting that ozone has been depleted more than had previously been thoughtto have occurred, some nations are likely to call for a phase-out of thechemicals already included in the Protocol along with a freeze or reductionin the production and consumption of other chlorinated compounds that werenot included in the original agreement. The Agency expects that methylchloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane, TCA) and carbon tetrachloride (CC14)will be among the new chemicals suggested for inclusion in the Protocol.Therefore, the EPA is putting current users of these chemical substanceson notice that a freeze and/or reduction in the production and consumptionof a methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride may be forthcoming. The present worldwide concerns about TCA focus primarily on the chlorineemissions that occur because of current uses. EPA is particularly concernedhowever, about future increases in the use of TCA because of regulatoryactions recently taken or which are being prepared by EPA and the OccupationalHealth and Safety Administration (OSHA). These regulatory actions restrict(or presumably will restrict) the use of other chlorinated solvents suchas methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene by placingexposure limits on the chemical substances. These exposure limits may leadsome chlorinated solvent users in the short-term to substitute the useof methyl chloroform for these other solvents instead of trying to controlexposures. In addition, there are U.S. and worldwide concerns about continueduses (and emissions and subsequent exposures) of carbon tetrachloride asa solvent and as a pesticide. EPA strongly encourages chlorinated solvent users and producers to seeklow cost, long-term solutions and to use the best available controls tominimize environmental releases of all of the chlorinated solvents listedabove in complying with the federal regulations mentioned. In addition,EPA wants to make clear that the Agency does not condone simply substitutingone problem chemical for another, and strongly encourages the use of lessobjectionable chemicals or non-chlorinated solvent alternatives where possible.More importantly, EPA wants to reinforce its earlier position as statedin the August 1988 ANPRM (53 FR 30617) that ``EPA expressly does not viewshifting away from CFC-113 to <T3>other chlorinated solvents which are currently under regulatory scrutinyby EPA</T3>, as an acceptable solution to protecting the ozone layer.''This means that in stopping the use of CFC-113, the Agency does not wantproducers and users to replace it with solvents which are also consideredozone depletors or probably human carcinogens. The chlorinated solventsunder regulatory scrutiny by EPA include methyl chloroform, methylene chloride,perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride. In this ANPRM, EPA discusses the new scientific information available onmethyl chloroform and explains the possible role of methyl chloroform inozone depletion. In addition, the Agency explains why carbon tetrachloridemay also be added to the list of chemicals regulated under the Protocol.EPA is seeking comments on its analysis and on the possible impact of placinglimits on methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride by adding them tothe list of chemicals regulated under the Montreal Protocol. A. New Scientific Information In its August 1988 ANPRM, EPA discussed new scientific information suggestingthat ozone was depleting at a faster rate than the scientific communityand the Agency had originally anticipated. Over an 18-month period theworld's leading atmospheric scientists conducted an extensive review ofthe existing ground-based and satellite measurements of the rate and levelof ozone depletion. The group of scientists issued an executive summaryof their work in March of 1988 (The Ozone Trends Panel Report: ExecutiveSummary; 1988). They reported that apparent ozone decreases since 1969 of 1.7 to 3.0 percenthad occurred in Northern mid-latitudes. They also stated that, ``Therehas been a large, sudden, and unexpected decrease in the abundance of springtimeAntarctic ozone over the past decade,'' and that CFCs were a primary causeof the Antarctic ozone hole. The authors also specifically cited methylchloroform as an important source of chlorine that photochemically controlsthe abundance of ozone. The full body of this report has not yet been released or reviewed by EPA.However, the summary clearly suggestes that current atmospheric modelsmay significantly underestimate the link between CFCs and ozone depletion.Applying the models used in the EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA),the ozone depletion of the magnitude that the Ozone Trends Panel Reportcites, has already occurred over the past twenty years, should not haveoccurred even with the CFC reduction called for by the Protocol until theyear 2050. Additional research appears necessary to account for this apparentunderprediction. An alternative approach can be used which looks at therisk of ozone depletion as a function of chlorine and bromine levels inthe stratosphere. Future chlorine and bromine concentrations in the upperatmosphere will depend primarily on future CFC and halon emissions, andtheir atmospheric fate. In August 1988, EPA issued a study entitled ``FutureConcentrations of Stratospheric Chlorine and Bromine,'' (Clx Report), (Officeof Air and Radiation, EPA 400/  1-88/005, August 1988), which looked atchlorine and bromine levels after the implementation of the restrictionsin the Montreal Protocol. The EPA found that levels of chlorine in thestratosphere would increase from 2.7 to 8 parts per billion (ppb) by 2075,even with the reductions in CFCs called for in the Protocol. This increase would be caused not only by the continued continued use ofCFCs and halons, but also by the growth in the production and use of thenon-regulated chemicals such as methyl chloroform. Specifically, the studypredicted that approximately 45 percent of the increase in the chlorineand bromine would be caused by emissions from the remaining CFCs and halons.An additional 35 percent of the increase in chlorine would occur as theresult of methyl chloroform emissions. Furthermore, the EPA analysis showedthat if methyl chloroform use increases as predicted, it would accountfor over 80 percent of the growth in chlorine levels associated with substancesnot covered by the Protocol. The Clx Report also examined what actions would be required to stabilizechlorine at current atmospheric levels. It showed that a phase-out of CFCsand at least a freeze in methyl chloroform would be required. It is importantto note however, that stabilization would not reverse past ozone depletion.To reverse past ozone depletion that the Ozone Trends Panel reports hasalready occurred and to return Clx levels in the stratosphere to thosethat existed prior to the Antarctic ozone hole, even further cuts in methylchloroform might be required. B. Potential for Growth in Methyl Chloroform Use Chemical companies that produce methyl chloroform have stated that theydo not expect methyl chloroform production or use to grow within the nextfew years. However, in the absence of limits on this chemical its productionand consumption may increase substantially within the next few years fora number of reasons. First, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) promulgatedregulations (54 FR 2332, January 19, 1989) that reduce the PermissibleExposure Level (PEL) to exposures of perchloroethylene and trichloroethylenein the workplace. OSHA is also planning to promulgate new PEL standardsfor methylene chloride to a level substantially below the current level.OSHA expects that manufacturers should be able to comply with these limitsby increasing ventilation in the workplace, or through the use of othermaterials, which are less hazardous. However, in many cases changes inworkplace equipment or operating procedures may not be sufficient to meetthese new standards. Solvent users may be inclined to switch to methylchloroform, rather than try to meet the new federal standards for theircurrent solvent. Second, EPA may, within the next few years, further regulate perchloroethylene,trichloroethylene, and methylene chloride because the Agency classifiesthem as probable human carcinogens. The Agency is also concerned aboutthe non-cancerous or other acute health effects these chemicals may have.In addition, EPA is in the process of writing a National Emission Standardfor Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) which will control ambient air emissionsfor perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene and methylene chloride. Moreover,since these chemicals are classified as probable human carcinogens, theyare targets for EPA regulations concerning wastewater discharge. More importantly,many companies worried about the stigma of a probable human carcinogenclassification may use TCA instead of the other solvent because of concernsover public image, liability and insurance expenses. For these reasons,additional layers of federal regulation may increase user preference formethyl chloroform. Third, the reduction in CFC production and import required by the EPA ruleimplementing the Montreal Protocol may lead some CFC users to substitutemethyl chloroform for CFCs. However, the Agency has made clear that itdoes not view shifting from CFC-113 to other chlorinated solvents whichare currently under regulatory scrutiny as an acceptable solution to protectingthe ozone layer.D. CFC Substitutes EPA has sponsored and co-chaired with industry a variety of technologicaland economic workgroups to discuss alternatives to CFCs in industrial andcommercial uses. For example, EPA and industry are engaged in cooperativeprojects to determine whether electronic components and circuit boardscan be cleaned with aqueous and terpene cleaners instead of CFC-113 ormethyl chloroform. In addition, the Agency has been working with chemicalmanufacturers and industry representatives to find out the extent to whichCFC-113 and methyl chloroform can be replaced in metal cleaning or degreasing.EPA is coordinating the review of these substitutes among various Agencyoffices and with other federal agencies, to ensure that current federalregulations or policies do not unnecessarily hinder the switch away fromCFCs to other chemicals or processes. For example, the EPA is working withthe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to revise ane eliminate military procurementspecifications that require manufacturers to specifically use CFC-113,methyl chloroform or other chlorinated solvents in electronic, precisionand metal cleaning. Eliminating restrictive specifications would allowCFC-113 and methyl chloroform to be replaced with other chemicals, non-chemicalssolutions, or processes that perform equally as well or better and do notcontribute to ozone depletion.D. Carbon Tetrachloride Carbon tetrachloride is a relatively strong ozone depletor, and in facthas a greater ozone depleting potential than any of the CFCs currentlylisted in the Protocol. In the U.S. it is used primarily as a feedstockto produce other CFCs. Emissions from this use were believed to be small,and therefore it was reasonable to exclude carbon tetrachloride from theoriginal Protocol. However, atmospheric levels have been found to be greaterthan would be expected from past emissions estimates. Preliminary evidencesuggests that in Japan, the Eastern Block countries and less developedcountries, carbon tetrachloride is used in the production of pesticides,as a solvent and in the production of synthetic rubber and dyes, amongother things. Emissions estimates for these uses are still uncertain. Nevetheless,EPA believes that they may be significant and that it may be necessaryto control them under the Protocol.E. Public Comments Sought As stated previously, EPA is issuing this ANPRM to solicit general commentson the role of methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride in stratosphericozone protection efforts, and specific comments on the possible effectof adding methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride to the list of chemicalsregulated by the Montreal Protocol. The Agency is specifically seekingcomments on the following points. (1) What substitutes exist for methyl chloroform in the following use categories:metal, precision and electronic cleaning, aerosols, and adhesives? (2) What can EPA do to expedite and assist in finding substitutes for methylchloroform in these use categories? What are the barriers to such substitution?(3) Will the demand for methyl chloroform increase when the initial reductionin CFC use is effective, in July 1989? (4) Should the international response be to freeze, reduce or eliminatemethyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride? How, and why or why not? Overwhat time period?<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">EPA (1988) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ``Future Concentrationsof Stratospheric Chlorine and Bromine,'' EPA 400/1-88/005, July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">EPA (1987) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ``Assessing the Riskof Trace Gases That Can Modify the Stratosphere,'' EPA 400/1-87/001, December1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">EPA (1987) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ``Regulatory ImpactAnalysis: Protection of Stratospheric Ozone,'' December 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">EPA (1988) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ``Regulatory ImpactAnalysis: Protection of Stratospheric Ozone,'' August 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Molina, M.J. and F.S.
