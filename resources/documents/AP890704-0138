He also expressed concern about the increasingly popularultrarightist Republican Party headed by former Nazi SS soldierFranz Schoenhuber. Schaeuble said many Republican pronouncements``are similar to speech used by representatives of extremism.''   Schoenhuber says his party is not extremist, but speaks out forGerman interests and supports constitutional law.   Membership in organizations officially labeled ``right-wingextremist,'' including neo-Nazi groups, climbed to 28,300 last yearfrom 25,200 the year before, Schaeuble said. Those figures do notinclude the estimated 13,000 Republicans, whose party has not beenofficially labeled ``right-wing extremist.''   Schaeuble said membership in right-wing extremist groupscontinues to grow in this nation of 61 million, and may have alreadysurpassed 30,000.   The Republicans concentrate on nationalist themes. They advocateradical reductions in the number of asylum-seekers allowed to stayin West Germany and strict limits on foreign workers.   The party has made strong election showings in the past sixmonths, including winning its first seats in the European Parliament.   Schaeuble told reporters that state and federal officials willmeet in September to examine whether the Republicans should belabeled a right-wing extremist organization. If that happened, theparty would be kept under surveillance by the Verfassungschutz, thecountry's main domestic intelligence agency.</TEXT></DOC>
