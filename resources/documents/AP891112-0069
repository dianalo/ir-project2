Meanwhile, another newspaper said one of the five senators,Democrat Alan Cranston of California, continued to intercede withfederal regulators on behalf of financier Charles H. Keating Jr.for two years after auditors urged the takeover of Keating'sLincoln Savings and Loan Association.   Edwin Gray, former head of the Home Loan Bank Board, told theHouse Banking Committee last week that he was asked at an April 2meeting with four of the five Senators to ease regulatory pressureon Lincoln by dropping a rule barring the thrift's riskyinvestments.   The four at the meeting were Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., JohnMcCain, R-Ariz., Cranston, and John Glenn, D-Ohio. Sen. Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich., has acknowledged making subsequent entreatieson Keating's behalf, although he did not attend the meeting.   Together, the five received $1.3 million in campaigncontributions from Keating, who has told reporters he certainlyhoped his contributions had bought influence with the senators.   In a related matter, The Arizona Republic reported on Sundaythat Federal Election Commission records show DeConcini also mayhave received $600 in illegal campaign contributions from aPhoenix-based home building company.   The company, Emerald Homes, was identified in a $1.1 billionfederal racketeering lawsuit as participating with Keating andothers in fraudulent real-estate transactions involving Lincoln.   The questionable contribution was made by Emerald executiveWilliam P. Junge who sent DeConcini a note two months agoindicating Emerald ``actually made this contribution,'' theRepublic said.   Although it is not clear when the FBI questioning reported byThe Boston Globe on Saturday and The Washington Post on Sundaybegan, the chief of the Justice Department's public integritysection wrote to Common Cause on Oct. 24 that the department wouldthoroughly review the political watchdog's call for aninvestigation into whether Keating's actions violated federalelection laws, or other laws.   While declining to comment on whether the FBI is conducting aninvestigation, a Justice Department official pointed out Sundaythat such interviews by agents would be normal practice in apreliminary review of allegations that laws had been violated.   The Globe's report Saturday quoted two ``well-placed sources''as saying Gray was interviewed by agents last week and that Graydeclined to confirm whether he was questioned. The report did notsay whether the interviews took place before or after Gray'scongressional testimony.   The Post account said other regulators also were questioned, butdid not say whether they were among those who also gave testimonythat backed up Gray's assertions to the House panel last week.   All five of the senators have acknowledged taking campaign moneyfrom Keating and interceding on his behalf. All five, likewise,have denied any wrongdoing.   The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News reported Sunday that Cranstoncontinued to intercede with Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall.   The paper quoted Cranston's top aide, Roy F. Greenaway, asacknowledging that the senator was pushing early this year for aquick sale of Lincoln and said he did it because the sale wouldhave averted a taxpayer bailout of the thrift and would have taken``Keating out of the savings and loan business'' even thoughKeating would have remained an investor.</TEXT></DOC>
