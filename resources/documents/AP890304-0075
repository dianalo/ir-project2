The two sides were about as far apart as labor and management canget: $200 million.   The airline, facing $1 million-a-day losses, wanted its biggestunion to take a 15 percent to 26 percent pay cut totaling $150million. The union wanted 8 percent salary increases for its 9,100members at a cost of $50 million, but offered in the final hours tostart with a 15-month freeze, chief negotiator Charles Bryan saidSaturday.   Each side characterized the other's position as outrageous.   Accusations flew back and forth: The company was out to bust theunion. Organized labor wanted a strike to test President Bush.Parent company Texas Air head Frank Lorenzo wanted to chop up andsell off the 60-year-old airline. The union wanted a better dealthan other employees who already had taken cuts. Management wanted abetter deal than other airlines who operated at a profit withoutcutting salaries.   Overshadowing the charges and countercharges was already shakenpublic confidence in air travel because of recent accidents andterrorism, controversy over corporate takeovers such as the one thatabsorbed Eastern into the nation's largest airline company, andquestions about Bush's relationship with organized labor in thefirst months of his administration.   These and other issues affecting aviation loomed over the finalnegotiations leading up to 12:01 a.m. Saturday when Bryan, thepresident of the Eastern local, declared: ``It's shut down.''   Pressure on both sides to reach a settlement came mostly from theNational Mediation Board, which handles labor disputes in thetransportation industry. Federal negotiator Harry Bickford had spentmore than a year trying to get the two sides together.   Other pressures early on pointed to a strike. Organized labordeclared strong support for the union, including pledges to honorpicket lines no matter where they are set up. Eastern advertised theeditorial support it was getting in its efforts to prevent Bush fromstepping in to stop a strike.   On Thursday, mediation board Chairman Walter C. Wallace hadexpressed strong optimism over the first new Eastern proposal inmonths, enthusiastically telling a news conference it offered apossible ``breakthrough'' in the talks.   It became clear on Friday, however, that there wasn't going to bea breakthrough.   About three hours before the midnight Friday end of a federallyimposed 30-day cooling-off period, Wallace said the union hadrejected the new offer, which only slightly toned down the proposedsalary cuts.   But that was not the end of the negotiation in what was supposedto be a secret Washington location.   Reporters, photographers and television crews gathered in thefinal hours on the sidewalk in front of the downtown Radisson ParkTerrace Hotel to buttonhole negotiators as they entered and left.Hotel officials ushered journalists out of the hotel lobby, butperiodically sent out hotel personnel to serve free coffee.   Eastern's team already had set up shop at a different location,which did remain secret. Much of the final bargaining was over thephone, said Wallace.   But a half dozen times during the evening, Eastern negotiatorsarrived and then left, refusing to talk with reporters.   Members of the Air Line Pilots Association, which representsEastern's 3,500 pilots, also walked in and out of the meetings, butsaid little about the talks after issuing a statement threateningwhat they said would be safe and legal steps that would``substantially delay'' flights nationwide.   Union negotiators remained silent to the outside world.   Later, Eastern chief negotiator Tom Matthews told reporters thecompany made several offers in the last hours, but accused the unionof never waivering from its original demand. He said the company hadmodified its proposals to soften pay cuts.   Its major new offer would have reduced hourly top-scale wagesfrom $18.83 to $16 for aircraft mechanics and from $15.60 to $11.54for baggage handlers, with no hope of increases for five years.   The cuts were a few cents kinder than the offer Eastern stuckwith during months of talk, but they were still too harsh for theMachinists. Bryan said Eastern's bargaining demands were virtuallythe same as they had been since the beginning. The union, on theother hand, offered a 12-month wage freeze, then a 15-month freeze,in its final efforts to avert a strike.   Union demands included sweeping measures such as guarantees fromEastern that it would rebuild itself to its former size. Lorenzo hassold off some of its assets and is awaiting Federal AviationAdministration approval to sell Eastern's lucrative Northeast airshuttle services to New York developer Donald Trump.   Company officials have accused the union of trying to run thebusiness.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, in declaring national supportfor the Machinists before the strike, accused Lorenzo of trying todestroy Eastern.   ``What the facts will show,'' said Kirkland, ``is that Mr.Lorenzo has found it worth his while to purchase a good comapny andstrip its assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.''   Bush foreclosed the surest way to averting a strike when heannounced nine hours before the deadline that he would not call anemergency panel that would have delayed a walkout by at least 60days. His decision came despite recommendations from the NationalMediation Board, 33 Senators and labor unions that he step in.   In what was viewed by many in organized labor as the first majortest of his dealings with the union movement, Bush did exactly whatmanagement had asked: nothing.   It was clear that when Bush made his decision, he knew settlementwas unlikely. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, shortly aftermeeting with Bush, said all the information he had pointed to astrike.   ``It is time for this dispute to come to an end. It makes nosense whatsoever to let these skirmishes and drawn out negotiationscontinue for another 60 days,'' Skinner said.   One of Eastern's offers in the final 90 minutes said the unioncould walk off the job for 48 hours and get full pay for employeeswhile they vote on whether to ratify the strike.   That, too, was rejected.   After it was all over, Eastern's Mathews declared, ``We willcontinue to bargain. ... Strikes are not the end; they are thebeginning of another period of time.''</TEXT></DOC>
