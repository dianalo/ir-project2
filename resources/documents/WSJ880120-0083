In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the big defense concern said net rose to $192.9 million, or 71 cents a share, from $149.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.    Sales fell 7% to $2.68 billion from $2.87 billion a year earlier.    The latest quarter was bolstered by a $49 million tax adjustment, equal to about 18 cents a share, related to previously deferred taxes on B-1B bomber program income. Because of last year's Tax Reform Act, the company paid taxes at a lower rate than it deferred them.    Pretax operating profit dipped 6% to $296.2 million from $314.8 million, mainly reflecting the expected wind-down of the B-1B program. The company attributed lower earnings in its general industries segment to expansion costs. Revenue and earnings were up in the automotive and electronics segments.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Rockwell closed at $16.875, down 50 cents.    Robert Anderson, chairman and chief executive officer, said the results &quot;are a positive indication that the company is making the transition from the major contribution of the B-1B program to stronger contributions from our other businesses and give us added confidence that 1988 will be our 13th consecutive year of increased earnings per share.&quot;    Analysts said that Rockwell's results were in line with expectations. Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said that the report wouldn't cause him to revise his full-year earnings estimate of $3.15 a share. In fiscal 1987, Rockwell earned $635.1 million, or $2.27 a share, on sales of $12.12 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
