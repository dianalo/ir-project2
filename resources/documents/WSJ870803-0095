The collapse of negotiations between Tan Sri Khoo and the Brunei government last week makes it likely that the sultanate will vigorously prosecute the former officials, including Khoo Ban Hock, the bank's ex-chairman and Tan Sri Khoo's eldest son.    The scandal, one of Southeast Asia's biggest in recent years, developed last November when Brunei authorities seized the bank and charged five officials and auditors with several counts of criminal breach of trust, conspiracy to cheat and making false statements in annual reports. One of the original officials detained, Chen Ping Fang, has since died.    Seventeen additional charges were lodged last month against the remaining four men. At the same time, Azlan Robert Teo, the bank's former general manager, was arrested. Mr. Teo last week admitted during a bail hearing that he was guilty of each of the offenses with which he was charged. The other former officials have yet to enter pleas. No charges have been made against 70-year-old Tan Sri Khoo, who moved to London from Singapore after Brunei seized the bank.    The affair has tarnished the reputation of Tan Sri Khoo, long regarded as one of Asia's wealthiest and shrewdest tycoons.    Brunei now is likely to reactivate civil suits in at least four countries against the Khoo family, which owned more than 70% of National Bank when it was seized. The bank had large obligations to creditors and depositors and more than $475 million in loans owed to it by Khoo-related concerns.    Lawyers for the two sides, meeting late last month in Hong Kong, were on the verge of concluding an agreement that would have settled National Bank's net obligations of about $225 million, including about $150 million in debts to more than 30 international banks, Brunei officials and Khoo-family associates said.    The now-scuttled proposed agreement focused on the sale of Tan Sri Khoo's Southern Pacific Hotel Corp., a Sydneybased hotel chain, which was acquired by the financier in 1981. Brunei authorities currently hold all but four of the 10,000 shares in the hotel concern, which had been pledged as security for loans the bank made to Khoo-related companies.    Several buyers have expressed interest in Southern Pacfic. Brunei sources said that the sale of the chain plus other Khoo properties would have raised sufficient funds to cover National Bank's obligations outstanding.    A Khoo-family associate confirmed that family lawyers insisted on the dropping of all criminal charges. &quot;We expected that once the financial settlement was resolved, there would be some concession on the criminal matters,&quot; he said.    Brunei officials said the demand was unacceptable and showed that Tan Sri Khoo misperceived the sultanate's determination to seek criminal convictions of the former bank officials. &quot;It's a case of paranoia on his behalf. He's personalized all this and he sees his son as being held hostage and feels he can buy his release with money,&quot; one Brunei official said.    The former bank officials are scheduled to stand trial Oct. 5 in Brunei's High Court. </TEXT></DOC>
