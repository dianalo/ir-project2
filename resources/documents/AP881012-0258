The European Court of Justice said two car makers, Sweden's ABVolvo of Sweden and Renault of France, could refuse licenses tospare parts makers if they did not abuse this power of refusal.   On Wednesday, the EEC Commission said its probe must show ifFord and others, which it did not name, engaged in ``abusivepractices'' violating EEC antitrust rules.   The court said illegal practices included arbitrary refusal tosupply spare parts, charging unfair prices or not making parts formodels that were still on the road in large numbers.   The EEC's inquiry was begun several years ago followingcomplaints by independent spare parts makers that car makers usedtheir copyright and design rights to prevent them from making andselling components.   The Commission threatened to sue Ford U.K. Ltd. in 1985 after acomplaint by British spare parts makers but suspended its actionwhen Ford agreed to change some of its practices.   Investigation of the substance of the complaint against Ford iscontinuing, the Commission said.</TEXT></DOC>
