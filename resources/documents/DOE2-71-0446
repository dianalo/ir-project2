Anall photovoltaic power system was selected for the platform. The powersystem requirements for the station and platforms are shown in Table1. The Space Station program has a commonality requirement; commonalityis the use of the same components and assemblies to the maximum extentpossible for all program elements. Commonality is assumed to result insubstantial cost savings by minimizing development, qualification, andproduction costs. Commonality was a prime driver in the selection ofcomponents for the photovoltaic system for the manned station and platforms.</TEXT></DOC>
