The size of the $289 billion budget for fiscal 1988 matches spending authority for the current fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. The bill doesn't provide for increases to keep up with anticipated inflation, however, suggesting a third consecutive decline in defense spending authority.    The measure also limits the Pentagon to military activities within the bounds of certain House arms control policies that the Reagan administration opposes. President Reagan may veto the measure.    The defense authorization under debate in the Senate suggests a higher budget, at $303 billion. The Senate yesterday missed by only a vote the opportunity to end a filibuster blocking the bill. But progress on the bill remains stymied by a standoff over language binding the Pentagon to a strict interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which limits tests of antimissile systems.    &quot;We're headed for some sort of logjam here,&quot; predicted Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.    In every respect, the House's defense measure represents a thumping defeat for the Reagan administration, which had sought a smaller increase than in past years in hopes that Congress wouldn't cut the plan as deeply.    One of the hardest hit programs was the Strategic Defense Initiative, which is President Reagan's top military priority. The House slashed the anti-missile research program to $3.1 billion for fiscal 1988, far short of the $5.2 billion proposed, and a drop from the current year's spending level of $3.7 billion. In addition, the House measure bars the Pentagon from conducting any experiments that don't comply with a strict interpretation of the ABM Treaty. The administration wants to carry out more extensive tests, which would rely on the liberal reading of the missiles accord that the White House considers legally correct.    Spending for the MX missile, another administration priority, also was cut deeply. The House measure provides $874 million for 12 of the 10-warhead nuclear missiles, while the administration had proposed $1.3 billion for 21.    The bill would give no money to several weapons systems that received funding in the past, including the advanced cruise missile, the &quot;Big Eye&quot; chemical bomb, and the Army's Aquila vehicle, which is piloted by remote control.    Submarine projects, which generally draw support from both Republicans and Democrats, were funded at the levels proposed by the Reagan administration. The House earmarked $1.4 billion for the Trident submarine and $3.5 billion for 72 Trident II missiles.    The House measure would increase spending levels for several Army projects. It would provide $1.7 billion for General Dynamics Corp. M-1 tanks, up from $1.5 billion requested by the Reagan administration. It also would increase spending for the McDonnell Douglas Corp. Apache helicopter to $789 million from $655 million requested by the administration.    In addition to embracing the ABM Treaty interpretation the administration opposes, the House measure calls for the Pentagon to abide by the missile launcher limits of the expired Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II, and would continue a moratorium on testing anti-satellite weapons. The administration opposes both of these policies. </TEXT></DOC>
