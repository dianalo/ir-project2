There's Walter Jurek, anefficiency-expert-turned-newsletter-publisher-turned-money-manager; his 19-year-old son, David;and Carl Shrager, an erstwhile musician who learned the stockgame by editing a newsletter.   Until recently the group included Elizabeth Edelmann, who previously performed computer analysis for a linen-supply concern. But the mutual fund &quot;just wasn't her cup of tea,&quot; says the affable Walter Jurek. Ms. Edelmann retorts that she was told to do too much typing, so she quit after six months to become a stockbroker's assistant.    Newcomers like the Santa Barbara Fund are sprouting up throughout the mutual fund business these days. More than 400 stock, bond and money market funds began operations last year. The total number of mutual funds has swelled to more than 2,000 -- exceeding the number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.    But this boom poses problems for regulators, investors, and even for the fund managers themselves. Some of the start-up funds are ill-prepared for the competitive mutual fund business. Problems can range from portfolio management to marketing and administration. Even the most successful launchers of new funds, industry leaders like Fidelity Investments or Vanguard Group of Investment Cos., haven't always succeeded.    More than $800 billion is invested in mutual funds, with a quarter of all U.S. households participating, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. Investors are frequently advised to consider a fund's long-term history before buying. But more than half the funds on the market today didn't even exist three years ago.    &quot;Maybe they should license investors,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a fund ranking and brokerage firm.    The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates mutual funds, faces a David-and-Goliath task. Its investment regulatory unit, with a staff of only 180, oversees thousands of mutual fund companies and financial planners. All together, these managers oversee as much money as the national debt -- more than $2 trillion.    The SEC staff hasn't increased in recent years, and it is earmarked for only a small increase in the new federal budget. Some experts worry that the regulators don't have time or resources to do much more than deal with routine paperwork and preach self-control.    No previous money management experience is required to start a mutual fund. One does need to be a registered investment adviser and come up with $100,000 in seed money (although consultants say five times that amount is more realistic).    Some founders of new mutual funds, such as Ohioans Gerald L. Regula and John W. Irwin, have started with high hopes, only to discover how hard running a fund can be. Both men were stockbrokers and avid Ohio boosters. So they decided in early 1985 to launch a fund that would invest only in companies based in Ohio. They named it the 88 Fund, in a salute to Ohio's 88 counties.    The 88 Fund was troubled from the outset. The SEC challenged its initial registration statement because of risks associated with Ohio thrift institutions. That caused the fund to miss the prime selling season, when investors might have considered the 88 Fund for their Individual Retirement Accounts. Then, Messrs. Regula and Irwin found that their initial capital of $165,000 wasn't enough to promote the fund and cover expenses. &quot;If we'd had a half million dollars in the till, the red tape wouldn't strangle us,&quot; Mr. Regula says.    The 88 Fund has limped along, and is down to about 35 shareholders investing just a total of $120,000. With such small assets and big legal expenses, the 88 Fund was one of the few mutual funds to show a loss to investors last year. For the first four months of this year, the fund had an 8.9% gain, less than half the 19.9% rise in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    &quot;It's been a hassle for everybody,&quot; says Mr. Regula. &quot;I truthfully believe in the concept&quot; of the 88 Fund, he insists. But he adds that if he had the chance, &quot;I'd do it differently.&quot;    When new funds are proposed, highly specialized or boastful ones are subject to tighter SEC review. But for many ordinary-looking new funds, no additional disclosure about fund or founders is required.&quot;We have no indication or basis for concluding that's necessary at this point,&quot; says Kathryn McGrath, head of the SEC division that regulates investment companies.    The bull market of the past few years has helped most new funds show some gains. But many have lagged market averages, and could face tougher going if the securities markets enter a prolonged slump. The Santa Barbara Fund, for example, appreciated 0.17% in last year's fourth quarter and 12.02% in the first five months of 1987. That was behind the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, which showed total returns of 5.61% and 21.42%, respectively, in the periods.    Marketing can be a sore point for new funds, too. Many are &quot;no-load&quot; funds, which don't levy an upfront sales charge to investors. But brokers generally balk at selling such funds because they don't get any commission. And while big no-load funds are supported by media advertising, that's out of reach to small, start-up funds.    &quot;Nobody wants to sell you without a load,&quot; says Walter Jurek of the Santa Barbara Fund. His fund is no-load, but he concedes that probably was a mistake.    Like many small funds, the Santa Barbara Fund's main hope for visibility is its daily newspaper listing. The NASD, which prepares the main listing of mutual fund prices, requires funds to have at least 1,000 shareholders, or $25 million in assets. The Santa Barbara Fund has just $2.5 million in assets, and its shareholder tally suddenly leapt to 1,100 from 300 in recent months.    &quot;We hustled&quot; to expand the shareholder list, Walter Jurek says. The fund dropped its $1,000 minimum for new investors, allowing them to buy as little as one sharea $14 outlay. It also sent a mass mailing to &quot;friends, relatives, people on our Christmas card list,&quot; he recalls. To the NASD's satisfaction, at least, the Santa Barbara Fund is big enough to qualify now for a daily listing.    But the Santa Barbara Fund's parent company, Quality Services Inc., finds the money management business tougher to crack than Walter Jurek had hoped. &quot;The fund isn't in the black yet. It's definitely a loss to the management company,&quot; he says, even though the firm began taking at least part of its 1.5% fee from assets in the fourth quarter.    On a recent day, the Santa Barbara Fund's stock selection committee wrestles chairs into new quarters at Quality Services' offices -- a suburban business condominium complex.    Walter Jurek grapples with a stack of 30 or so manila folders -- each holding newspaper clips and other bits of information on a stock under consideration. There aren't any Quotron terminals to provide up-to-date stock prices. There is a personal computer. But it subsists on Value Line Inc. research that can be weeks, or even months old.    More than anything else, Santa Barbara is a &quot;coat-tail&quot; fund-hoping to emulate bigger players' successful moves. For instance, DiGiorgio Corp., a food wholesaler, gets a look largely because another fund manager has been buying its stock. But like many companies, it draws a &quot;let's look at it tomorrow&quot; from the crew.    The 49-year-old Mr. Jurek asserts that his previous career as an efficiency expert helps him as a stock-picker. He likes to be identified in brochures as &quot;Dr.,&quot; because of his Ph.D. in business administration from the University of Colorado. &quot;They used to call us hatchet men,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it's known as corporate restructuring.&quot;    His right-hand man, Mr. Shrager, 44, is a self-described former hippie musician who ran a local arts council before signing on as editor of the takeover stock newsletter . As Mr. Shrager recalls: &quot;One day, Walter came in and said, 'Why don't we just put our money where our mouth is.'&quot;    Soon after, the two began running the takeover stock fund.    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Money market funds dropped sharply this week as investors moved back into the more buoyant stock market.    Assets of the nation's 383 money market funds fell $2.46 billion to $236.45 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.    &quot;Institutional investors shifted dollars from money funds to higher yielding short-term instruments. Recent improvements in securities markets could also have prompted some investors to move dollars out of the general purpose and broker dealer funds into stock and bond funds,&quot; said Ann Anderson, assistant vice president for research at the institute.    Assets of 199 general purpose funds fell $921.0 million to $68.19 billion, and assets of 90 broker-dealer funds dropped $544.3 million to $104.82 billion. Assets of 94 institutional funds fell $992.5 million to $63.44 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, rose to 5.97% from 5.93% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds increased to 5.88% from 5.82%, and the average maturity of funds rose to 44 days from 43 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.32% on their &quot;money market savings accounts&quot; in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.57% for six-month savings certificates of deposit, unchanged from the previous week. Yields were 7.05% for one-year bank savings CDs, down from 7.07%. </TEXT></DOC>
