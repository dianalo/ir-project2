Boone Pickens' Mesa LimitedPartnership said today it has withdrawn its $1.9 billion cash offerfor Homestake Mining Co., the nation's largest gold producer.   Mesa said in a statement it was withdrawing its $20-per-shareoffer for Homestake's 93 million outstanding shares followingHomestake's rejection of the unsolicited bid earlier this month.   Mesa owns about 3.8 percent of Homestake stock.   Homestake's board said on March 7 the bid was inadequate andthat the company preferred to remain independent.   Homestake, based in San Francisco, holds interests in oil andnatural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does NewmontMining Corp., another major gold producer which was the target ofan unsuccessful hostile takeover bid by Pickens.   Last year, New York-based Newmont was approached by IvanhoePartners, another group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billionhostile bid for control of the company.   That move was blocked in October when a Delaware court upheld a``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain'sConsolidated Gold Fields PLC, grabbed enough shares in a two-daybuying spree to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmontand thwart the hostile bid.   Pickens made his reputation as a corporate raider withhigh-profile bids for several major oil companies in the early1980s, including Gulf Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp.   In the bids, Mesa launched hostile takeover attempts, thenpocketed millions of dollars in profits when the target companieseither were bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased its ownstock.</TEXT></DOC>
