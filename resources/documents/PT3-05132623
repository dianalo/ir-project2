The functions of various resistivity and dielectric constant      measuring devices such as logging tools are combined in a single tool. A      measuring tool includes novel transmitting and receiving antennas.      Electromagnetic energy flows to a transmitting antenna. A stripline      adapter permits transmission to a stripline having a metallic central      strip. A strip face is bent at approximately right angles, and has a      length that is compatible with the desired frequency coverage. A ground      plane extends from the stripline adapter to the right angle bend, and a      void exists between the center strip and the ground plane. A dielectric is      positioned to nearly fill the void. The antennas are positioned so that      the strip face lies flush with the tool face, to permit electromagnetic      energy to be transmitted into and out of the material to be analyzed. An      enclosure comprised of four metallic walls surrounds the stipline, and is      in electrical contact with the ground plane and the stripline adapter. The      invention permits an analysis of the fluids in the material as well. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to the analysis of materials having      dissimilar dielectric properties. More specifically, this invention      provides an antenna which can combine the functions of various resistivity      and dielectric constant measuring devices into a single tool, capable of      operating over a wide range of frequencies. It is particularly useful in      the field of well logging. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is well known to log or record certain electrical characteristics of      earth formations surrounding a well borehole as a function of depth in      order to determine the location and extent of oil-bearing strata and to      quantify the amount of oil present in such strata. A log of formation      resistivity versus depth may indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, since      hydrocarbon-bearing formations typically exhibit a higher resistivity than      formations containing mostly salt water. There are only three material      parameters which affect an electromagnetic wave. They are conductivity      (resistivity), magnetic permeability and dielectric constant. Conductivity      provides an indication of the energy absorbing characteristics of the      medium, while magnetic permeability and dielectric constant give a measure      of the energy storing capacity of a material. The magnetic permeability of      most earth materials is the same and is equal to the magnetic permeability      of free space. It is therefore of very little use in electrical logging      techniques. </PAR><PAR>  It is well known that conductivity or resistivity (which is the reciprocal      of the conductivity) has wide variation in value for earth materials and      strongly affects electromagnetic waves. A propagating electromagnetic wave      has two fundamental characteristics, amplitude and phase. By comparing the      amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave as it passes receivers,      propagation characteristics due to formation may be studied. Measurement      of these two characteristics (or equivalently, the wave travel time and      attenuation) may be used to determine the dielectric constant and the      resistivity of the media through which the wave is propagated. </PAR><PAR>  Dielectric oil well logging is aimed at determining the water saturation      and the water salinity in the formation from measurements of the      dielectric constant and the resistivity of the formation. A number of      criteria enter into the selection of the frequency of the electromagnetic      wave used to probe the formation. Depending on these criteria, service      companies have fielded a number of different logging tools at different      frequencies. However, no one tool in the prior art is capable of probing a      formation over a broad band of frequencies. It is therefore advantageous      to extend the frequency range to include the function of the dielectric      and the resistivity (induction) logging tools. </PAR><PAR>  The objective of dielectric logging is to measure the dielectric constant      and the conductivity of earth formations at a specific frequency, and      deduce therefrom the water saturation and the salinity of this water. It      has been found that logging at various frequency domains has various      specific advantages. For example, logging at relatively high frequencies,      near 1000 MHz, one probes a depth of only a few inches into the formation,      so that here one measures essentially the properties of the invaded zone      (i.e., the zone where the formation fluid has been displaced by the fluid      filtrate from the mud in the borehole). On the other hand, logging at      relatively low frequencies, near 20 MHz, allows one to probe much deeper      into the formation (.about. a few feet), yielding perhaps information on      the virgin formation. Logging at intermediate frequencies causes one to      probe intermediate depths. The low frequency tools are of the centralized      mandrel type, since at these frequencies the loss of energy in the mud      annulus between the tool and the formation can be tolerated. At high      frequencies, however, this loss would be prohibitive, and hence the high      frequency tools must necessarily be of the pad type, where the pad      directly contacts the formation or borehole wall. </PAR><PAR>  The development of tools at these many different frequencies shows that it      is advantageous to create a single tool capable of logging: </PAR><PA1>  (i) at a number of discrete frequencies </PA1><PA1>  (ii) over a continuous range of frequencies employing the swept frequency      technique, and </PA1><PA1>  (iii) in the time-domain, resulting - upon inversion - in the same      information as in (ii) above. </PA1><PAR>  The main advantages of such a tool would be: </PAR><PA1>  (i) it would yield the profile of water saturation and water salinity with      distance from the wellbore, and </PA1><PA1>  (ii) since a large amount of information would be gathered, this makes it      possible to deduce, from the dielectric log alone, the porosity, in      addition to the water saturation, and the water salinity. </PA1><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,894, issued to Katahara et al., describes an acoustic      logging tool, and does not discuss electromagnetic logging. It uses a      plurality of acoustic frequencies only to accommodate a wide variety of      formations having different preferred logging frequencies, and does not      teach a method of broadband logging over each formation. </PAR><PAR>  U.S Pat. No. 3,982,176, issued to Meador, discloses a conventional      induction log (20 KHz) and a conventional dielectric log (16 MHz) in      single tool, using different antennas (coils) for the different      frequencies. This is a mandrel type tool, that hangs freely in a wellbore      with an annulus of mud around it. There is no mention of broadband      logging. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,451,789, also issued to Meador, discloses a method of      depth-probing the formation by changing the transmitter-receiver spacing.      Frequency variation is not discussed. Although Meador uses three      frequencies, they are very closely spaced, and are not used for the      purpose of broadband logging. Meador simply uses slightly different      frequencies as a way of labeling the transmitter-receiver pairs It is      therefore essentially a single frequency tool. It is also a mandrel type      tool, which hangs freely in a wellbore. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,471, issued to Sims et al., discloses a      single-frequency (between 10 MHz and 200 MHz) mandrel type tool Sims does      not discuss how their antenna can accommodate this frequency range, or      whether different antennas are used for different frequencies. This patent      only uses a wider range of frequencies within the operation of an earlier      tool. The patent does teach that broadband dielectric logging is useful,      however. </PAR><PAR>  The largest hurdle to developing a broadband dielectric logging tool has      been the lack of a suitable broadband antenna that can couple      electromagnetic energy to and from a formation, and that is compact enough      to fit within the confines of a logging tool. </PAR><PAR>  An additional advantage is that a dielectric measuring apparatus can be      applied to the field of medical technology. For example, U.S. Pat. No.      4,240,445 issued to Iskander et al. teaches a method of coupling      electromagnetic energy into a material such as tissue, to measure water      content. Measuring lung water content is an especially useful application.      However, Iskander's device is so large that only a few antennas can be      place on the chest, and the antenna cannot be described as a point source.      Also, the electric field vanishes at some distance from the antenna, as      the electric fields in the two parallel slots are oppositely directed.      Furthermore, a resistor is included in the antenna, which dissipates much      of the electromagnetic energy in the antenna itself. Additional prior work      includes M. F. Iskander and C. H. Durney (1980): &quot;Electromagnetic      Techniques for Medical Diagnosis: A Review&quot;, Proceedings of IEEE, vol. 68,      no. 1. and M. F. Iskander et al (1982): &quot;Two-dimensional Technique to      Calculate the EM Power Deposition Pattern in the Human Body&quot;, Journal of      Microwave Power, vol. 17, no. 3. </PAR><PAR>  The prior work is limited in the attempts at broadband logging (or      measuring) in that no suitable single antenna element has been designed      which can couple electromagnetic energy into a material, whether it be a      geologic formation or tissue, over a broad range of frequencies, that is      also sufficiently compact and is capable of handling high power levels.      There is therefore a need for a device and a method for use in such      broadband logging/measuring/heating applications. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is surprisingly successful in providing a method and      apparatus for combining the functions of various resistivity and      dielectric constant measuring devices and electromagnetic energy coupling      device into a single tool, capable of operating over a wide range of      frequencies. It is especially useful in well logging applications. The      apparatus is capable of taking broadband measurements of materials having      dissimilar dielectric properties. </PAR><PAR>  A measuring tool such as a logging tool, having a tool face, also has a      novel transmitting and a novel receiving antenna. Electromagnetic energy      is transmitted to a transmitting antenna. A stripline adapter permits the      energy to flow to a stripline having a metallic central strip. A strip      face of the central strip is bent at approximately right angles, and has a      height that is compatible with desired frequency coverage. </PAR><PAR>  A ground plane extends from the stripline adapter to the right angle bend,      so that a distal end of the central strip extends away from it, and a void      is created between the center strip and the ground plane. </PAR><PAR>  A dielectric is positioned to nearly fill the void. The dielectric is      comprised of a material having a very high dielectric constant and a very      low energy loss. The transmitting antenna is positioned so that the ground      plane is fixedly connected to the measuring tool, and the strip face lies      flush with the tool face, so that electromagnetic energy can be      transmitted into the material to be analyzed. </PAR><PAR>  An enclosure surrounding the stripline is comprised of four metallic walls      which are positioned in electrical contact with the ground plane and the      stripline adapter, so that the strip face is nearly centered in the      opening created by the walls and the ground plane. </PAR><PAR>  A loss-less, non-conducting material fills in any remaining open space in      the enclosure, so that the non-conducting material forms an additional      wall that is really flat with the strip face. </PAR><PAR>  A receiving antenna is comprised in essentially the same manner as the      transmitting antenna, and is positioned in the tool so that it can receive      the electromagnetic energy which has traveled through the material being      probed. A means for monitoring the received energy detects changes as the      apparatus is moved across the material. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment of this invention, broadband measurements are taken      to determine the nature of a fluid in a material such as a geologic      formation. </PAR><PAR>  It is one object of this invention that electromagnetic energy is      transmitted and received over a wide frequency range, specifically from 2      KHz to 1 GHz. </PAR><PAR>  The tool may further comprise a pad, which conforms to the inside of a      wellbore and holds the antennas. At least one transmitting and one      receiving antenna are necessary. A plurality of each is often desirable.      Some antennas may be staggered in a spiral fashion, to prevent undesirable      coupling between adjacent antennas. </PAR><PAR>  Fluids analyzed include water and hydrocarbons. Electromagnetic energy is      monitored to provide an indication of the porosity, salinity, and water      saturation of the material to be analyzed. Depth probing a geologic      formation is a particularly useful application, to measure the nature of      fluids as a function of the distance from the antennas. </PAR><PAR>  The above and other embodiments, objects, advantages, and features of the      invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed      description of the invention, which is provided in connection with the      accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic, sectional view of the inventive logging (or      measuring) tool positioned in a wellbore. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a top, front, and side view of the novel transmitting antenna. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2A is the same view as FIG. 2, further illustrating the enclosing      metallic walls. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows an antenna mounted on a tool face. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4A-4E shows schematic side views of the inventive apparatus as applied      to well logging technology. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5A-5E show three graphs of transmission and return loss as a function      of frequency. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a graph of transmission and return loss as a function of      frequency, for low frequencies. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7A-7D show four graphs of time-domain transmission measurements at      various distances from a metal reflector plate in a brine. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, a new improved method and      apparatus for determining the nature of various materials and the fluids      contained therein, using a broadband measuring apparatus, has been      developed. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to the drawings, a first embodiment of the inventive broadband      logging (or measuring) tool 101 is shown in FIG. 1, positioned in a      wellbore 103. The wellbore wall 105 is sometimes lined with a layer of mud      cake 107. Pressure arm 109 positions tool face 111 near wellbore wall 105,      so that transmitting antennas such as T.sub.1 and T.sub.2 and receiving      antennas such as R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are positioned close to the mud cake      107 or the wellbore wall 105. The transmitting antennas, such as T.sub.n      and the receiving antennas, such as R.sub.n are mounted on the tool face      111 above and below the tool pad 119, and are positioned opposite the      wallbore 105, and are separated from It by the mud cake 107 and the mud in      the wellbore 103. The tool face 111 is defined as the outer surface of the      logging tool 101. </PAR><PAR>  A material, in this case a geologic formation 113 surrounds the wellbore.      An invaded zone 115 represents the region of the formation 113 that has      been permeated by the mud filtrate The outer region 117 is that part of      the formation 113 that has not been permeated by the mud filtrate In a      formation evaluation program, it is desirable to know the properties of      both regions, as a function of distance from the antenna or tool face 111.      This may be called depth-probing. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 1, the logging tool 101 has a pad 119 or pad-type device so that      some or all of the antennas can be positioned very close to the formation      so that electromagnetic energy can by transmitted through the formation.      The antennas work in pairs. That is, antennas T.sub.1 -T.sub.4 and T.sub.n      are transmitting 1 antennas, and antennas R.sub.1 -R.sub.4 and R.sub.n are      receiving antennas. Antenna T.sub.1 transmits electromagnetic energy      though the formation, and antennas R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 through R.sub.n      receive it. Antenna T.sub.2 transmits electromagnetic energy to antennas      R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 through R.sub.n, and so on, through antennas T.sub.n.      The antennas can all be positioned in a vertical line, as shown, or they      can be staggered, in the azimuthal direction. It is possible for any given      antenna to alternately play the role of a transmitting or a receiving      antenna. </PAR><PAR>  For any pair of antennas, T.sub.i R.sub.j, by measuring the phases and      amplitudes of the received power at R.sub.j and of the reflected power at      T.sub.i, the dielectric constant and the conductivity of the region probed      by the pair T.sub.i R.sub.j can be determined. From the dielectric      constant and the conductivity, water saturation and salinity can be      calculated using theoretical expressions well known in the art. It is      desirable that the antennas can transmit and receive energy over the      entire frequency range of interest. For dielectric well logging, a      frequency range of approximately 10-1000 MHz is desirable. To include      resistivity and induction logging, this range can be extended down to a      few kilohertz. </PAR><PAR>  The depth of investigation for a pair such as T.sub.3 R.sub.3 is a function      of the frequency of the probing radiation. As this frequency is gradually      reduced from a high value, the depth increases until at some frequency      f.sub.i it equals the depth d.sub.i, roughly obtained by drawing a      semicircle with T.sub.3 R.sub.3 as the diameter as seen on FIG. 1 (dashed      lines). Decreasing the frequency further does not increase the depth of      investigation much further Thus, each pair T.sub.i R.sub.j probes a zone      of depth d.sub.i appropriate to that pair and to the frequency f.sub.i for      that pair. In this way, a set of broadband antennas placed with different      spacings permits information about a set of zones of varying depth to be      obtained (the longer the spacing, the lower is f.sub.i). The above      discussion also illustrates that for a given transmitter-receiver pair,      some depth-probing is possible, by changing the frequency. Thus, by having      different transmitter-receiver spacings and the broadband capability,      redundant depth-probing is possible. </PAR><PAR>  Another use of the first embodiment incorporates the concept of standalone      logging. In conventional dielectric logging where the dielectric constant      and conductivity of a zone is measured at a single frequency, one needs an      independent knowledge of the porosity of the zone in order to convert this      information to water saturation and salinity. This porosity is usually      derived from a separate logging tool. However, if the same zone could be      probed in two very distinct frequencies, then the dual frequency data can      be inverted to simultaneously calculate the porosity, water saturation and      salinity, without the need of a separate logging tool. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1 for the pair T.sub.4 R.sub.4, if the frequency is      raised from f.sub.iandplus;1 (which is the frequency corresponding to the maximum      depth of investigation d.sub.iandplus;1 for the pair), the zone of investigation      will shrink from d.sub.iandplus;1 until at some frequency F.sub.iandplus;1, this zone      (dotted line 120) will have a depth equal d.sub.i. Thus, having broadband      antennas with different spacings permits us to probe the same depth      d.sub.i with two different frequencies. </PAR><PAR>  An example of the inventive transmitting antenna 150 is shown in FIG. 2. A      coaxial connecting means, such as coaxial connector 151 is electrically      connected to a stripline adapter 153 which is capable of transmitting      electromagnetic energy from the coaxial connector 151 to a stripline      section with metallic central strip 155. An especially useful stripline      adapter is a model No. 3070-1404-10 designed by Omni-Spectra, or other      types of microwave stripline adapters. Other types of transmission means      may be utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy to the antenna. For      example, a strip transmission line may be electrically connected to the      stripline section having the metallic central strip 155. As a commercial      coaxial-to-stripline transition means has been utilized, the dimensions      included herein reflect this means. One knowledgeable in the art would      realize that the dimensions may be altered to change frequency coverage      and to fine-tune performance. </PAR><PAR>  Metallic center strip 155 has a front end 157, a flat strip body 159, a      flat strip face 161, and a distal end 163. The front end 157 is      electrically connected to the center conductor 169 of the stripline      adapter 153. Solder is a particularly useful connecting means. Flat strip      body 159 may also be tapered to come to a point at front end 157 to      provide a smooth electrical transition between the center conductor 169      and the center strip 155. The strip face 161 is bent at approximately      right angles to strip body 159, and has a height that is measured from the      right angle bend to distal end 163. The height is compatible with the      desired frequency coverage. The longer the height, the more lower      frequency coverage is allowed. A 1/2&quot; height permits a frequency range of      approximately 2 KHz.fwdarw.1 GHz. The metallic center strip 155 can be      made of any metal. Copper, brass, or aluminum are especially useful. </PAR><PAR>  A ground plane 165 extends from stripline adapter 153 to the right angle      bend in the center strip 155, so that the distal end 163 extends away from      the ground plane 165 and so that a void exists between the center strip      155 and the ground plane 165. Ground plane 165 is comprised of a metal.      Commercial grade stainless steel is particularly useful. It is desirable      to keep the ground plane and center strip as short at possible, to permit      the apparatus to remain as compact as possible and to allow the use of as      many antennas as possible. </PAR><PAR>  The void between the ground plane 165 and the center strip 155 is largely      filled with a dielectric 167. The dielectric 167 should have a very high      dielectric constant and a very low loss. By loss, we mean the dissipation      of energy. The dielectric 167 can be a ceramic dielectric, and comprised      of material such as Barium Titanate or Lead Zirconate Titanate. A      crystalline dielectric may also be used, although more expensive. The      thickness of the dielectric 167 is determined by the stripline adapter 153      used. The dielectric 167 acts to make the capacitance of the center strip      155 very large. </PAR><PAR>  The construction of the antenna is completed by enclosing the center strip      155 by metallic walls 181, 182, 183, and 184, which contact the ground      plane 165 and the adapter 153 electrically, as shown in FIG. 2A. The walls      add rigidity and prevent leakage of the electromagnetic radiation. The      strip face 161 is approximately centered in the rectangular opening      created by the edges of the walls and the edge of the ground plane 165.      Thus, the distance between an edge of the strip face 161 and the adjacent      edge of a wall is substantially the thickness of the dielectric 167. The      entire void space in the antenna enclosed by the walls, including the set      back 168 at the dielectric edge, is filled with a loss-less,      non-conducting material such as a mixture of epoxy and alumina which sets      hard, seals the antenna, and makes it more rugged. </PAR><PAR>  The ground plane 165 and the walls 181, 182, 183, and 184 are fixedly      connected to a logging (or measuring) device or tool as seen in FIG. 3.      The strip face 161 is positioned to lie flush with the tool face 171 (or a      tool pad), so that the transmitting antenna 150 can transmit      electromagnetic energy into a material such as a geologic formation or      mammal tissue. Void space 173 is filled with a loss-less, non-conducting      material such as an epoxy-aluminum compound. The ground plane 165 and the      walls 181, 182, and 183 connect to the tool face (or tool pad) and the      center strip 161 becomes the sensor &quot;button&quot;. </PAR><PAR>  A receiving electromagnetic antenna is comprised in essentially the same      manner as the transmitting antenna, and is positioned in the logging tool      in the same manner as the transmitting antenna, so that the receiving      antenna can receive the electromagnetic energy which has traveled through      the material that is analyzed. </PAR><PAR>  The logging tool also contains a means for monitoring the received      electromagnetic energy for changes, as the tool is moved across the      material and moves across the interface of materials having dissimilar      dielectric properties so that the interface can be located, and the nature      of the material can be evaluated. An example of frequently studied      dielectrically dissimilar materials are hydrocarbons and water, both of      which are normally contained in the pore spaces of rocks. </PAR><PAR>  The logging tool is capable of transmitting and receiving electromagnetic      energy that has a range of frequencies. The range of frequencies is from      about 2 KHz to about 1 GHz. In this embodiment, the electromagnetic energy      is of sufficient strength to travel through the material (or formation) to      the receiving antenna as a propagating wave. The amplitude and the phase      of the received signal contain information (dielectric constant and      conductivity) about the formation. A duplicate receiving antenna is      usually employed, thereby obtaining measurements that eliminate certain      unknown factors. Additionally, by employing a duplicate transmitting      location above or below the pair, the effects of alternate upward and      downward transmission are averaged to achieve &quot;borehole compensation&quot;,      known in the art. In a second embodiment, the logging (or measuring) tool      (a device) determines the nature of a fluid in a material. The material      may be, for example, a geologic formation or may be a mammal tissue. In      this embodiment, the device is constructed as in the first embodiment,      except that the means for monitoring the electromagnetic energy for      changes as the apparatus is moved across the material determines the      nature of the fluid. For a geologic formation, the fluids analyzed can be      hydrocarbons and water. </PAR><PAR>  In either the first or second embodiment, the electromagnetic energy can be      monitored to provide an indication of the salinity and the water      saturation of the material. If the same zone could be probed in two very      distinct frequencies, then the dual frequency data can be inverted to      simultaneously calculate the porosity, also. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus transmits electromagnetic pulses of designated profile shapes      into the material to be analyzed, such as a geologic formation. The pulses      are received by antennas spaced at different distances from the      transmitter. The different receiver spacings correspond to different      depths of investigation. When the received pulses are analyzed, one      obtains a broadband dielectric spectrum for different depths in the      formation. Together, all this information yields the depth-dependent water      saturation, salinity, porosity and matrix dielectric constant (matrix      identification). The depth-dependent water saturation could then be      analyzed to give an estimate of the permeability. The other conventional      parameters such as formation factor can also be derived from the data, if      there is present in the well, a zone with 100% water saturation. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention may operate either in time or frequency domain, or      both. The above paragraph describes the application in the time domain.      Because of the compact size of the invention, many such sensors can be      installed on a tool, to comprise an array of sensors capable of      &quot;depth-probing&quot; the formation (i.e., measuring the saturation and the      salinity as a function of distance from the wellbore). The depth-probing      and the wide frequency coverage aspects can possibly be combined to give      the tool a stand-alone character: It can, in and of itself, determine the      porosity, the salinity, and the water saturation without the need of an      additional porosity tool (which is required in the present art). </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4A-4E illustrate various applications of the inventive apparatus as      applied to well logging technology. The antennas (both receiving and      transmitting) can be mounted on a pad 201 or pad-type device which is      designed to substantially conform to the inside of the wellbore 203, as      seen in FIGS. 4B, 4D, and 4E. The pad acts to reduce or prevent      propagation of the electromagnetic energy through the lossy mud 205. At      low frequencies, however, the loss in the mud is tolerable and the      antennas can be mounted on the tool face 207, on a centralized tool, as      shown in FIGS. 4A and 4C. A combination of two arrangements is also      possible, as seen in FIG. 4E, where antennas are positioned both on tool      face 207 and on a pad 201 or pad-type device to include low frequency      waves. The vertical spacings and azimuthal orientations are selected from      theoretical considerations known in the art. Therefore, the device may      comprise a single transmitting antenna and one or more receiving antennas,      or it may comprise a plurality of transmitting antennas. The antennas may      be oriented in several arrangements. They may be staggered about the tool      face and/or pad or may be staggered in a spiral fashion. Staggering of the      antennas minimizes unwanted coupling between adjacent antennas, while      still permitting a short spacing distance between antennas. </PAR><PAR>  It is advantageous to use several antennas at pre-selected spacings. This      provides a variable depth of investigation, as one transmitting antenna      could be used with a plurality of receiving antennas. A variable frequency      of investigation is also possible, as larger spacings are required with      larger wavelengths. Also, redundant spacings provide enhanced quality      control. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus can operate in the frequency domain, using a single      frequency, multiple frequencies (such as simultaneous, selectable, or      time-multiplexed for example), or swept frequency techniques Or, the      apparatus can operate in the time domain, using pulses of a wide variety      of shapes, widths, rise and fall times, etc. When the pulses are      transformed to the frequency domain, either electronically using a      spectrum analyzer, or numerically using mathematical transforms, the same      information is obtained as would be given by a frequency domain tool. </PAR><PAC>  THEORY OF TIME-DOMAIN DIELECTRIC LOGGING </PAC><PAR>  A time-domain tool eliminates much of the cumbersome electronics of a swept      frequency or a multiple frequency tool, and shifts the burden of the      electronics to software. Consider a tool with a broadband transmitting      antenna located at Zandequals;0 and two identical broadband receiving antennas      located at Z.sub.1 and Z.sub.2 (Z.sub.0, Z.sub.1 and Z.sub.2 being three      points along the axis of the wellbore). Suppose that an electromagnetic      pulse f (t, 0) of a finite duration is launched into the formation at Zandequals;0      beginning at tandequals;0 (f (t, 0) andequals;0 for t.ltoreq.0 and tandgt;t.sub.o, say). </PAR><PAR>  The Fourier frequency components of this pulse are given by:      ##EQU1##      where .omega. is the circular frequency of the radiation. Similarly, the      pulses f (t, Z.sub.1) and f (t, Z.sub.2) received at Z.sub.1 and Z.sub.2      can be decomposed into their spectral components:      ##EQU2##      Now, the relationship between the transmitted and received Fourier      components is </PAR><EQU>  F(.omega., Z.sub.1)andequals;F(.omega., 0) e.sup.ikZ 1 M(.omega.)

G(.omega.,      Z.sub.2)                                                  (5) </EQU><PAL>  where </PAL><PA1>  kandequals;.alpha.andplus;i.beta. is the complex wave number and </PA1><PA1>  .alpha.andequals; phase shift of the wave in radians/meter </PA1><PA1>  .beta.andequals; attenuation of the wave in nepers/meter </PA1><PA1>  M(.omega.) andequals; factor resulting from mismatches at the transmitting      antenna/formation and receiving antenna/formation interfaces </PA1><PA1>  G(.omega., Z)andequals; factor resulting from geometric spread of radiation. </PA1><PAR>  Dividing (5) by (4) eliminates the term M(.omega.), and we have      ##EQU3##      whence the relative dielectric constant .epsilon. and the conductivity      .sigma. are obtained using the relations:      ##EQU4##      where .alpha., .beta., .epsilon. and .sigma. are all function of      frequency. </PAR><PAR>  The geometric factor in Equation (6) has to be determined experimentally by      pulsing the tool in air and in other lossy media of known, lossy      dielectric properties, such as brine. </PAR><PAR>  In the alternative to Equation (6), the dielectric properties may also be      derived by referencing to only one receiver, and using equations (4) or      (5). Here, the quantity M(.omega.) is determined by measuring the power      reflected back into the transmitting antenna due to the mismatch, as      described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,331 issued to De and Keetch. </PAR><PAR>  A prototype logging tool pad was constructed, with the inventive antennas.      The pad consists of one transmitting and one receiving antenna, the      distance between them being variable. </PAR><PAR>  An acceptable dielectric logging antenna must meet the following criteria: </PAR><PA1>  (i) It must be able to couple sufficient energy into and from the formation      at its operating frequency to allow probing of the formation; </PA1><PA1>  (ii) This probing energy must penetrate into the formation, rather than      clinging to the surface of the tool pad (i.e., it must travel as a freely      propagating wave rather than a surface wave guided along the pad). </PA1><PAL>  In the present instance, the above two conditions must hold over the entire      range of the frequency of operation. </PAL><PAR>  The first of the above criteria is tested by measuring the return loss for      the transmitting antenna, and the transmission loss from the transmitting      to the receiving antenna - both as a function of frequency. These      measurements are shown in FIG. 5 where the antenna pad is placed in air      and against brine of conductivity 0.5 mho/m (to represent a formation).      The return loss curve in brine shows that sufficient energy is entering      the brine over the frequency range of the measuring device      (Hewlett-Packard HP8505A Network Analyzer; 500 KHz - 1300 MHz) to permit      probing. The transmission loss shows that sufficient energy is being      received at the receiving antenna to permit measurements. </PAR><PAR>  Measurements were made by using another measuring device (HP3577A Network      Analyzer; 5Hz - 200 MHz) to test the low frequency limitation of the      antenna. The results are shown in FIG. 6, showing that the low frequency      limitation is about 5 KHz. The improved return loss performance in the 200      MHz region (at FIG. 5) results from a drying (curing) of the epoxy alumina      filling between measurements. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 shows time-domain transmission measurements at various distances (d)      to a metal reflector plate in the brine The change in amplitude of the      received pulse as a function of the distance of the metallic reflector      shows that the energy has penetrated into the brine out to the location of      the plate. </PAR><PAR>  While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described and      illustrated, it should be apparent that many modifications can be made      thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.      Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the foregoing description,      but is only limited by the scope of the claims appended hereto. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
