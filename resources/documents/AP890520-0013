Only 10 of the 95 senators who have released their 1988financial disclosure statements refused honoraria. According toseparate calculations by the Common Cause lobbying group, honorariatotaled $2.7 million.   Among those to accept the payments:   _Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, accepted $6,000 in honoraria from the defense industry.   _Jake Garn, R-Utah, former chairman and now senior Republican onthe Senate Banking Committee, reported $16,000 in honoraria fromthe financial industry.   _Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., a member of the Senate FinanceCommittee, which oversees major health programs, accepted $11,100in honoraria from that industry. The Smokeless Tobacco Council alsopaid him a $2,000 speaking fee.   _Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee, accepted $10,000 for speeches to theenergy industry and a trip to Alaska subsidized by oil, gas andforestry companies.   _Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the Senate BankingCommittee, reported receiving $10,000 in just two days from thefinancial industry.   _Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., a member of the agriculture committee,accepted a weekend trip to the Kentucky Derby from the Brown andWilliamson tobacco company, plus a $2,000 honorarium.   Senators are allowed to keep honoraria equal to 40 percent oftheir regular salaries of $89,500. Many earned much more than that,but gave the excess to charity to stay under the limit.   No limits are imposed on book royalties, and Senate MajorityLeader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned $22,500 in royaltiesfrom ``Men of Zeal,'' a book on the Iran-Contra affair that hewrote with his Maine colleague, Republican Sen. William Cohen.   Cohen's $25,763 in royalties also included some still coming infrom a novel he wrote with ex-Sen. Gary Hart.   The disclosure forms confirmed once again that the Senate isstill populated with millionaires, about a third overall.   A notably wealthy newcomer is Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., who reportedthat his Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Association franchiselost $95,000 last year.   The senators only have to report general ranges of assets andincome, but Kohl is among the richest senators. He listed assets ofup to nearly $28 million and liabilities of less than $2 million.John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose grandfather founded Ralston Purina,listed assets of up to $13 million and no liabilities.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., reported he was unable todetermine his assets, which are in a blind trust. His income,however, was at least $607,686. Similarly, the extensive wealth ofJay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is tied up in trusts.   Mitchell is among the paupers of the Senate, listing assets ofjust $5,000 to $15,000. Under the rules, that figure does notinclude his home.   Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Republican leader, was better off. Helisted assets of about $293,000 to $691,000. Dole listed $36,000 inhonoraria, of which he donated $31,750 to charity.   Dole was among those who reported receiving some interestinggifts. He accepted a series of lithographs depicting ``the heritageand history of Armenian life'' and a crystal magnolia for his wife,Elizabeth, now secretary of Labor.   Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, received from former heavyweight boxingchamp Muhammad Ali an inscribed championship ring. Hatch reportedhe considered the ring ``priceless,'' but the gold content wasworth $6,500 and the gem $1,000.   Five senators received extensions to file their disclosureslate. They were Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho;Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; and John Glenn, D-Ohio.   The financial disclosure statements sometimes are only asaccurate as the lawmakers make them.   The Justice Department on Friday accused Rep. Charles Rose,D-N.C. in a civil suit of failing to report on his federalfinancial disclosure statements $138,694 in loans he obtained oversix years.   House financial disclosures for 1988 are scheduled for releaseon Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
