Responding to price-depressing stockpile statistics and other factors, prices of December-delivery crude oil on the Merc plunged to a low of $18.05 a barrel. But they made an almost 60-cent turnaround to close at $18.64 a barrel, up 24 cents from Tuesday. The January contract also hit a $18.05 low before ending the day at $18.59 a barrel, up 22 cents.    Oil products followed crude's pattern in a record-setting day for heating-oil volume. Estimated volume of 40,311 heating-oil contracts on the Merc eclipsed the record of 39,264 set Oct. 20. The estimated 112,883 crude-oil contracts was just below a record of 114,872 set Oct. 16.    &quot;I think all of us are totally perplexed about what happened,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy-futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute that showed a rise in U.S. oil stockpiles, particularly heating oil, as well as concerns about overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries clearly drove world markets lower, he said.    &quot;But when London closed . . . it was if someone put their foot down on the gas pedal and the market just took off,&quot; said Mr. Barakat.    Eric Bolling, a broker at Geldermann Inc., summed up the feeling on the New York Merc floor: &quot;This one's nuts here.&quot;    An analyst described the market by midday as being &quot;hopelessly oversold.&quot; Analysts said positive news at midday -- British Petroleum Co.'s announcement that Kuwait had acquired a 10.06% stake -- and the realization that the $18 barrier wouldn't be broken, was enough to spur buying and send the market up.    The Kuwaiti announcement was bullish coming shortly before the important OPEC meeting in Vienna early next month, said Mr. Barakat. &quot;Why would Kuwait buy BP if they thought the market was collapsing?&quot; he explained.    The market's gyrations are typical in periods leading up to big OPEC meetings, analysts said. The market is expected to continue to react strongly to OPEC actions and posturing by the cartel's members in coming weeks.    John Hill, vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York, said heating-oil prices yesterday &quot;held in fairly well, considering.&quot; The petroleum-institute statistics released after the market closed Tuesday showed a 5.5 million rise in stockpiles for the week ended last Friday, to 127.3 million barrels. In addition, summerlike weather in the East doesn't bode well for strong demand.    However, heating oil for December delivery, after falling along with crude, recovered somewhat to settle at 54.94 cents a gallon, down 0.26 cent at the close.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    SUGAR: Futures prices advanced on expectations that demand on the world market will increase. March-delivery sugar rose 0.20 cent a pound to 7.86 cents, near the day's high, on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange. Analysts and trade sources said Eastern Bloc countries have been sporadic buyers of small quantities of sugar, leading them to believe that the Soviet Union will have to buy sugar. Soviet sugar output is expected to be hurt by cold and wet weather there. India, which has faded from the scene lately, is expected to buy sugar because of crop losses caused by drought. &quot;Sooner or later, India will have to buy sugar,&quot; one dealer said.    COPPER: Futures prices continued to recover from Monday's decline. The December contract settled at $1.039 a pound, up 3.8 cents. The December-to-March premium increased 0.15 cent to 7.9 cents, as the March contract settled at 96 cents, up 3.65 cents. Other than a continued decline in stocks of copper in New York Commodity Exchange warehouses, there were no new developments, analysts said. Comex stocks at Tuesday's close fell 909 tons to 42,391 tons. An analyst said more technically oriented traders, who probably moved to the sidelines following Monday's losses, apparently returned and added further support to the market. Meeting after the close of trading, the Comex board of governors increased original margin requirements for the December copper contract to 50% of the full value of the contract. The change is effective Nov. 30 at the opening of trading, which is the first day that notices for the delivery of copper against the December contract will be issued. The increase will apply to speculative and hedging positions, and only to overnight positions, an exchange spokesman said. If the increase had been effective at yesterday's close, a 25,000-pound contract's speculative margin would have risen to $12,998, a $4,988 increase, and the hedge margin would have increased by $7,988. On Nov. 10 Comex raised margins, or good-faith deposits, on the December contract by $5,200 a contract to $8,000 for speculative positions and by $3,000 a contract to $5,000 for hedge positions.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: A continued build-up in stocks and expectations that a heavy slaughter of hogs will continue sent the price of pork-belly futures tumbling. After Tuesday's close, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reported that about four million pounds of pork bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, were placed in out-of-town warehouses last week. A little more than one million pounds were stored in the year-ago period. Cattle prices finished higher as futures prices continued their rise toward higher cash levels. Hog futures finished mixed.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices recovered from losses early in the day to close higher. Comments from several congressmen expressing disappointment with progress in continuing talks aimed at cutting the U.S. budget deficit boosted the currencies and depressed the dollar. But traders and analysts said the market outlook could change on an hourly basis today and tomorrow depending on the status of the parleys. &quot;The tone of the deficit talks is getting less hopeful. The currencies very well might keep moving up,&quot; said Jill Cotter, a futures analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
