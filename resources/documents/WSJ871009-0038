Greenberger and Monica LangleyStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration, backing away from a probable bitter confrontation with Congress, dropped plans to sell Saudi Arabia 1,600 Maverick missiles and prepared to notify lawmakers today of the remaining $1 billion arms-sale package.    In a Senate news conference, legislators applauded the administration's decision to exclude the Maverick air-to-ground missiles, valued at $316 million, from the package. As a result of the deletion, &quot;there will not be a battle on the floor of the Senate,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), a leader in the fight against selling the Mavericks. The package is &quot;probably going to be approved,&quot; agreed Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), the minority leader.    House members also appeared ready to end their attack on the long-planned Saudi arms sale. &quot;If the opposition is crumbling in the Senate, it's pointless to conduct a fight in the House,&quot; said Rep. Mel Levine (D., Calif.).    The administration first notified Congress last June that it planned to sell the Mavericks and other weapons to Saudi Arabia. When the proposal received a frosty reception, the administration pulled it back and now has deleted the Mavericks from the package.    Administration officials assert that the weapons are needed by Saudi Arabia because of possible Iranian aggression against it and also to boost the confidence of the Saudis. But opponents of the proposed sale contend that the missiles would be a threat to Israel.    Administration officials had been negotiating with members of Congress in recent weeks over the proposed sale, with some officials suggesting that the number of Mavericks be reduced or that the Saudis be asked to return 2,400 older Mavericks they currently own in exchange for the new ones.    Frank Carlucci, the president's National Security Adviser, met with Senate leaders earlier this week but was told firmly that if any Mavericks were included the package would be dead on arrival on Capitol Hill, according to congressional sources.    Under arms-sales procedures, the administration customarily gives legislators a 20-day informal notification period, followed by a 30-day formal notification period. If Congress doesn't block the sale during the 30-day period, the administration may proceed with it.    The package to be submitted will include as many as 12 F-15 aircraft, valued at $502 million, that would be sold to the Saudis only as replacements for F-15s they already own. The sale also would include improved radar and computer software, valued at $300 million, for the F-15s; field vehicles valued at $62 million and items valued at $108 million to improve M-60 tanks.    Referring to the Saudis' needs for U.S. arms, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said: &quot;If we fail to meet these legitimate needs, our willingness to support friends -- who are in need and who are helping us in the face of very real threats -- will come under serious question in the gulf and elsewhere around the world.&quot;    Mr. Fitzwater added that the administration &quot;assured&quot; the Saudis that the U.S. would provide them Mavericks from American stocks in case of an emergency. A congressional source said that the Saudis were told specifically that the weapons would be rushed to them should they become involved in a shooting war with Iran.    In the past, the president has been able in emergencies to authorize weapons-sales to friendly governments without obtaining congressional approval.    Opponents of the Maverick sale contended that the Saudis have sufficient weapons in inventory to defend themselves. Indeed, they noted -- and the Pentagon confirmed -- that Saudi Arabia hasn't yet signed contracts for, or taken delivery of, some weapons previously approved by Congress. These weapons include helicopters and electronic improvements for F-5 and F-15 aircraft.    At yesterday's Senate news conference, lawmakers also said that Mr. Reagan doesn't intend to sell shoulder-fired, ground-to-air Stinger missiles to Bahrain. The administration had been considering selling $7 million of the missiles, but members of Congress had expressed concern that the weapons could fall into terrorists' hands.    Mr. Reagan wouldn't be required to inform Congress in advance of such a sale, which falls below the $14 million threshold for notification. But in informing lawmakers that he wouldn't undertake the sale, Mr. Reagan clearly was seeking to avoid another confrontation with Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
