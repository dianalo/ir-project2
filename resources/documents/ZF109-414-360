 The connection may notbe immediately obvious but the thought is provoked by recent research fromIDC which suggests that by 1993 Europe will be the world's biggestinteractive training market.andP;  IDC forecasts market growth from $120 billionto $165 billion in 1993 - a growth rate of 11-12 percent, around 3 percenthigher than in the States.andM;My own feeling is that even those calculations are understated because theyignore the Eastern Europe factor.andP;  Both Schneider and IBM are targetingRussian education.andP;  Schneider has negotiated an agreement for shipment of10,000 personal computers as well as assistance in setting up PCmanufacturing facilities.andP;  Their first product will be an XT clone, whichwill be followed by an AT clone.andP;  The computers are earmarked for educationalinstitutions.andP;  IBM is negotiating a long-term deal to supply personalcomputers to the Soviet education system.andP;  Olivetti have set up a 50 percentowned company in Yugoslavia-a country which hopes to join the EuropeanCommunity in two to three years.andP;  The Japanese are everywhere, setting upjoint venture deals.andM;The view is reinforced by a look at the desktop publishing market.andP;  TheEuropean desktop publishing market is the biggest in the world, worth $1.83billion and rising to $3.9 billion by 1994, according to Frost andamp; Sullivan.andO;By then they reckon there will be 97,000 new desktop publishing installationsin Europe, of which 18,400 will be in the U.K.andP;  (the biggest country market).andO;The U.K.andP;  holds the lead because of the availability of English languagesoftware from the States (XPress, PageMaker and Ventura).andP;  However, Apple andAdobe are overcoming the language limitations and 1994 should see thecombined French/German/Italian markets worth $1.5 billion.andP;  Imagine thepotential for desktop publishing growth in Eastern Europe where evenphotocopiers were under lock and key until a few months ago!andP;  Rich pickingsindeed.andM;The question is: Will American hardware continue to pour over the bordersinto the European theatre?andP;  The answer is that it probably will.andP;  But it willhave to surmount many barriers, post-1992, and that spells local manufacture.andO;The Japanese are already here, with the take-over of Britain's biggestcomputer manufacturers.andP;  ICL has been swallowed up by Fujitsu.andP;  Apricot hasbeen absorbed into Matsushita (Panasonic) who plan to market their computersworld-wide using the Apricot name.andP;  U.S.andP;  companies have been slow off thestarting block and they had better get moving fast if they want to hold on totheir lead in 'the biggest market in the world,'andM;The U.S.andP;  companies have a lot going for them, such as standards.andP;  Only threethings in the world can create standards:andM;1.andP;  The consumerandM;2.andP;  IBMandM;3.andP;  The PentagonandM;One or another have created MS-DOS and Unix.andP;  The other great software toolsof the multimedia revolution are also American: HyperCard, AuthorWareProfessional, MacroMind Director and Windows 3.0.andP;  Even the grandaddy ofmultimedia, Apple, is also an all-American success story (until Sony buysthem out).andP;  So the Yanks are coming to Europe, one way or the other.andP;  Butthey are going to have to run a tight ship otherwise they will be upstaged bythe Eastern Europeans who are lean and hungry - and no slouches in thesoftware arena.andP;  Consider the following.andM;&quot;Working on a Russian version of Microsoft MS-DOS, the world's most popularPC operating system, a team of young Soviets came across a previouslyundiscovered bug in the program.andP;  Microsoft told them that their Russianversion would have to be delayed while the system was debugged in the US.andO;This could take up to four months.andP;  Twelve hours later the Soviet team haddone the job.andM;&quot;In the Soviet Union there is an extraordinary paradox.andP;  In a state wherevirtually nothing from telephones to TV sets can be depended on to work,there exists an enormous reserve of computing talent.andP;  After a while youbecome used to hearing, and begin to believe, that an entire factory wasautomated using the tiny Commodore 64 PC or that the emergency system at anuclear power plant is controlled by a 25-year old Soviet-mademini-computer.&quot;andM;-- Robert Farish in The Guardian, June 21andM;The Nukecastle ConnectionandM;I can remember advising Newcastle University some five years ago thatinteractive video was in decline and compact disc was the way to go.andP;  Theyignored my advice and went ahead and set up the Interactive Learning projectbased on interactive videodisc.andP;  And they were right to do so.andP;  The resulthas been a stunning collaboration with an industry group called the BritishNuclear Forum, which has produced some of the most innovative multimediadevelopments in education.andP;  They have used an advanced non-standard computercalled the Archimedes, which is available in British schools, to put togethera total package for under $3,000, making multimedia affordable for education.andM;This bold experiment forces us to re-assess our attitude to interactivevideo.andP;  Perhaps our original objections were to the applications developedwith the technology (interrupted video) rather than the technology itself.andO;Whatever; the Newcastle discs are going to upturn the conventional wisdom.andM;The three double-sided discs are for the 12-16 age range and meet theappropriate attainment targets of the national curriculum.andP;  They are:andM;* EnergyandM;* Radiation and RadioactivityandM;* Risk, Probability and StatisticsandM;And to answer the question which seems to nag everybody, there is no built-inpro-nuclear message-either overt or covert (other than the fact that theyhave been funded by the nuclear industry).andM;The gen-lock and high resolution screen is well exploited.andP;  In aweightlifting sequence on the Energy disc, for example, students can call fora computer-generated measuring stick, point to the cross-piece using themouse and then slide the cross piece up and down the measuring stick.andP;  As itmoves the height which is set is shown in a small window.andP;  Thecomputer-generated graphics are so good that it is difficult to distinguishthem from the video picture.andP;  To achieve that level of resolution andprocessing power in a DOS environment you would need at least a 386 machineand a total package costing three times the price.andM;This use of windows and the marriage of computer-generated material and&quot;live&quot; video is characteristic of the whole.andP;  All the while there is anemphasis on doing things and interactivity.andP;  Pupils build up their ownlessons, responding to the pictures on the screen, exploring ideas thatinterest them, and learning from the interaction.andP;  They are tremendous.andP;  Theonly cloud on the horizon is that one of the sides on the Energy disc won aNebbie award at Nebraska as an outstanding educational disc.andP;  And we all knowwhat usually happens to award winners.andM;BitsandM;* It's a little-known fact that there's a far flung outpost of CommodoreInternational here in little old London which even the Commodore U.K.andP;  boysdon't seem to know about.andP;  It all started when Commodore's president hiredPaul Bailey to bring some integration/communication into the Commodoreempire.andP;  The thought was that Commodore Germany were good at one thing,Commodore U.K., say, another.andP;  Couldn't they work together?andP;  The result wasthe setting up last June of Commodore International Marketing in darkestHammersmith.andP;  Simon Dismore is looking at the multimedia and Unix scene, withan eye on the kiosk market.andP;  Steve Paul is majoring on CDTV.andP;  I'll tell youmore after I've met these guys.andM;* Multimedia exhibitions rampant.andP;  The news is that EMAP, Blenheim-Queensdaleand Reed are all contemplating multimedia exhibitions in the U.K.andP;  next year.andO;It has to be said that there ain't room for all of them.andP;  Blenheim areinterested in taking over the CD-I event run by Philips.andM;* September sees the launch by British Telecom of the complete Britishtelephone directory on CD-ROM, to coincide with the announcement that thefree directory enquiry service is being discontinued.andP;  This will do more forcorporate CD-ROM sales than any other single factor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
