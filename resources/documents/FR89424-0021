On January 29, 1988, a Spanish exporter,Roldan S.A., requested in accordance with section 355.10 of the CommerceRegulations an administrative review of the order. We published the initiationon March 2, 1988 (53 FR 6681). The Department has now conducted that administrativereview in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``theTariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as providedfor in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). Imports covered by this review are shipments of Spanish stainless steelwire rod, which includes coiled, semi-finished, hot-rolled stainless steelproducts of approximately round solid cross section, not under 0.20 inchnor over 0.74 inch in diameter, whether or not tempered or treated or partlymanufactured. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiedunder item numbers 607.2600 and 607.4300 of the Tariff Schedules of theUnited States Annotated. This merchandise is currently classifiable underHTS item numbers 7221.00.00.20 and 7221.00.00.40. The review covers theperiod January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1987 and six programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>(1) Long-Term Loans Under the Concerted Action Program Under the Concerted Action Program established by Royal Decree 669/74,the Spanish government directs banks to make long-term loans to steel companiesat below-market rates. Such loans are provided for approximately ten years.Roldan received a long-term loan for financing new plant and equipmentthat had an outstanding balance during the review period. The loan wasreceived in multiple disbursements from 1977 to 1981. Because the loansunder the Concerted Action Program are provided to a specific industryat rates and terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, we preliminarilydetermine that this loan confers a countervailable domestic subsidy. Roldan did not obtain any comparable commercial loans in the year in whichit received the preferential long-term loan. Therefore, we used as ourlong-term commercial benchmark the ``free'' long-term (three or more years)lending rate published by the Bank of Spain in its <T3>Boletin Estadistico. </T3>We treated the multiple disbursements asindividual loans.To calculate the benefit, we found the difference between the annual amountsof principal and interest Roldan actually paid and the annual amounts ofprincipal and interest Roldan would have paid if it had received each disbursementat our commercial benchmark rate. We then calculated the ``grant equivalent''of each disbursement by determining the present value (at the time thepreferential loan was made) of the difference in annual payments that wouldoccur during the life of the loan. Using our declining balance methodologywith the long-term commercial benchmark as the discount rate, we allocatedthe grant equivalents over the life of the loan. We then totaled the reviewperiod benefits allocated for each disbursement.Since these loans benefit a company's total production, we allocated thebenefit over the company's total sales during the review period. On thisbasis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.27percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>during the review period.(2) Prefinancing of Exports Under Privileged Circuit Exporter Credit ProgramAs part of its Privileged Circuit Exporter Credit program, the Spanishgovernment, under Royal Decree 2254/85 of November 20, 1985, required banksto set aside a specific percentage of lendable fundsfor the prefinancingof exports. The maximum amount of allowable funds for prefinancing of exportswas 69 percent of the invoice value until July 1, 1987, when it was reducedto 61 percent. The maximum term of these loans was 90 days and the interestrate ranged between 10 and 10.5 percent. Because this program is contingentupon export performance, we preliminarily determine that it confers a countervailablebenefit on exports.To calculate the benefit, we compared the preferential interest rate toour commercial benchmark and applied the interest differential to the principalamounts of the loans. We used as our commercial benchmark an annual averageof the ``free'' three-month lending rate published in the <T3>Boletin Estadistico. </T3>Since Roldan was able to tie these loansto specific shipments, we allocated the benefit from loans for U.S. shipmentsover Roldan's exports of stainless steel wire rod to the United Statesduring the review period. We preliminarily determine the benefit from thisprogram to be 0.15 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>Because this program was terminated effective March 5, 1987, pursuant toRoyal Decrees 321/1987 and 322/1987, we preliminarily determine that forthis program the cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties will bezero. (3) Energy Saving GrantUnder the Ministerial Order of December 17, 1984 and pursuant to RoyalDecree 101/1984 of January 25, 1984, the Institute for the Diversificationand Saving of Energy provides funds for investment in energy saving equipment.This program is part of the National Energy Saving Plan (PEN) and opento all energy saving projects. Roldan received a grant for energy savingequipment under this program. Eligibility for this program is not contingent upon export performancenor limited to any specific region, industry or groups of industries. TheGovernment of Spain has provided information showing that a wide varietyof industries and sectors in all regions and provinces have taken advantageof this program. Because this program is not limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries, we preliminarily determinethat this program does not confer a countervailable subsidy. (4) Other Programs We also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine thatRoldan did not use them during the review period: A. Operating Capital Loans. B. Capital Grants. C. Regional Incentives Program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy forthe period January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1987 to be 0.42 percent<T3>ad valorem. </T3>The Department considers any rate less than 0.50 percentto be <T3>de minimis. </T3>The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, withoutregard to countervailing duties, all shipments of this merchandise exportedon or after January 1, 1987 and on or before December 31, 1987. The Department also intends to instruct the Customs Service to waive cashdeposits of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act, on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication ofthe final results of this review. This deposit waiver shall remain in effectuntil publication of the final results of the next administrative review.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days after the date of publicationor the last workday preceding. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than 5 days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review,including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
