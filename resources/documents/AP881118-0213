Oil officials from the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries shuttled among three hotels in the Austriancapital in search of a solution.   The oil ministers are trying to fashion a new productionagreement that would limit output and push up prices, which arerunning $4 or more below the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   Analysts have been skeptical about chances that the ministerswould be able to come up with a strong agreement, however.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh met for about 90minutes with officials from Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.   ``I don't have anything new for you,'' he told reporters afterthe meeting in the plush Marriott Hotel.   ``It's too early to say something. ... I hope we reach asolution,'' he said.   Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, arrived at thehotel a few hours later for lengthy talks with the other ministers.   ``Our position has not changed,'' he said before the discussions.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto, the former Indonesian oilminister, said the meetings were ``taking place in a goodatmosphere.''   ``We are hearing several approaches that we are trying out,'' hesaid. ``There are many approaches to the problem and we should nottotally follow one track.''   He refused to offer any details.   He acknowledged the task was difficult.   ``We are realistic enough to understand that these problems weare facing are not easy ones,'' he said.   At issue is Iraq's insistence on being allowed, under an OPECagreement, to produce the same amount of oil as rival Iran. Iran hasrefused such parity.   The cartel sets quotas or ceilings on the amount of oil its 13members can produce.   The ministers are trying to arrange a new accord _ the currentone dates to 1986 _ that would limit the recent surge in productionthat has added to the already glutted market.   Iraq refused to join the current arrangement because of itsdemand for parity with Iran.   Since the two countries agreed to a cease-fire in August in their8-year-old war, efforts have been stepped up to try to bring Iraqback into the OPEC quota system.   Aghazadeh said he was still pressing for ``export parity'' withIran. That refers to his proposal that the rivals be given the samequota for overseas sales.   But Iran wants a higher overall ceiling to account for itsgreater domestic demand estimated at some 1 million barrels a day.Iraqi internal demand is put at about 300,000 barrels a day.   Analysts estimate that Iraq has been producing at least 2.6million barrels a day. The sum could soar to 3.7 million barrelsnext year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia tothe Red Sea. Its quota under the 1986 accord was 1.5 million barrels.   Iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 2.4 millionbarrels.   The current production agreement sets total production at 15million barrels a day, excluding Iraq.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that the cartel's production jumped to almost 21.1million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in morethan five years.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has boosted itsoutput to more than 6 million barrels a day, analysts estimate, wellabove its daily quota of 4.3 million barrels.   The behind-the-scenes talks were held throughout the day. Theyfollowed a brief meeting Thursday night of officials from eight OPECcountries, who are members of two cartel committees.   The formal committee discussions were to resume Saturdayafternoon.   On Monday, all 13 oil ministers will gather for their wintermeeting.   OPEC members include Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia,Venezuela, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.   Others are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates.</TEXT></DOC>
