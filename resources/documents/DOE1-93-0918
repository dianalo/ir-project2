In such applications,a precision requirement may be assigned to a query which implies thatthe error in the answer should not exceed some predetermined bound. Thedegree of imprecision in the database must be controlled such that aquery always operates on data which is sufficiently accurate such thatthe computed answer meets or exceeds the precision requirements of thequery. In this paper, the concept of precision in databases for bothqueries and data is introduced and formalized. Algorithms for maintaininga database at a specified degree of precision are presented and analyzed.We then describe how these algorithms may be employed for the purposeof choosing an optimal query plan by a query optimizer. 23 refs., 5 figs.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
