In another business-relateddecision as the court opened a new term, the justices refused totake up an antitrust controversy stemming from the once-plannedacquisition by Thomas J. Lipton Inc. of Kraft Inc.'s CelestialSeasonings Inc. two years ago.   Competitor R.C. Bigelow Inc. had claimed in a federal lawsuitthat a merger would create a monopoly. A federal judged favoredLipton, but an appeals court reinstated the suit, saying the deal,which was later canceled, was in apparent violation of antitrustlaws.   In the worker-safety decision, the Supreme Court let stand aruling in an Illinois case that federal workplace regulations don'tbar state prosecutions.   Five officials of Chicago Magnet Wire Corp. await trial oncharges of recklessly injuring 42 workers by exposing them to toxicchemicals, extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at awire-coating plant.   But Chicago Magnet Wire officials argued criminal charges shouldbe dropped because the federal government pre-empted stateprosecutions when it enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Actof 1970. The company said worker safety should be part of uniformnational standards.   The Illinois Supreme Court last February ruled that statecriminal law ``can provide a valuable and forceful supplement toinsure that workers are adequately protected.''   In the case involving Alaska, the high court left intact rulingsthat allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 5.6million acres of Bristol Bay, off Alaska's southwestern coast.   The court turned away warnings by Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper andothers that an oil spill in Bristol Bay could do more environmentalharm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince WilliamSound last March.   The disputed leases were sold for nearly $100 million after afederal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected achallenge by Cowper and numerous enviromental groups, fishingassociations and Alaska communities.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the casebut four votes are needed to grant such review.   In other business-related decisions Monday, the Supreme Court:   _Asked the Bush administration for its views on broadening thepower of states to sue on behalf of gas consumers allegedlyovercharged by utility companies.   _Agreed to decide whether a federal law unfairly makes it toodifficult for coal miners who contract ``black lung'' disease toobtain a lawyer's help when seeking benefits.   _Agreed to decide whether farm workers who suffertransportation-related injuries may sue their employers afterreceiving worker-compensation benefits.   _Decided to consider placing new limits on the ability ofconvicted criminals to avoid making restitution to their victims bydeclaring bankruptcy.   _Refused to hear an appeal by non-union Pennsylvania stateemployees who oppose paying the equivalent of dues to a union thatrepresents them in collective bargaining.   _Refused to reinstate a $3.5 million damage award a Missouritelevision station owner won, and then lost, against CapitalCities-ABC Inc.   _Let stand a ruling that allows the so-called ``gray market''import of Lladro porcelain by permitting a firm to sell the producteven though another company is the exclusive U.S. distributor.   _Let stand a $1.2 million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyersfor consumers who sued over allegedly defective transmissions insome General Motors Corp. cars.   _Refused to disturb a state's ban on telephone solicitation forpre-arranged funerals.</TEXT></DOC>
