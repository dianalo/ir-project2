But whether phone bills will go even lower under newly proposed regulation is a matter of heated debate.    Earlier this week, the Federal Communications Commission proposed removing its limit on ATandamp;T's profits and replacing it with a price cap. FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick and ATandamp;T executives contend that the company would have more incentive to cut costs, passing part of the savings to consumers, with the rest fattening ATandamp;T's bottom line. Moreover, says Larry Garfinkel, an ATandamp;T vice president, the company would be more inclined to put new technology in its network, which would generate new services.    But consumer groups are skeptical. &quot;Based on what we know, rates go down more under profit regulation,&quot; says Fred Goldberg, the Washington counsel to the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.    Currently, ATandamp;T's interstate rates are set by limiting how much it can earn on its $9.1 billion investment in interstate plant and equipment. The allowed rate of return is now 12.2%. Under price regulation, the FCC would instead set a ceiling on what ATandamp;T can charge. The ceiling would rise or fall depending on inflation, taxes, the industry's productivity, and ATandamp;T's costs to connect to local phone companies.    The debate over which system is best centers in large part on how good the FCC is at monitoring ATandamp;T's costs. Under profit regulation, prices should drop as technological advances reduce the company's costs. But if ATandamp;T can keep its costs artificially high -- and many people think it has -- prices won't drop as fast as they could. One analyst estimates that ATandamp;T could easily cut $2 billion of costs without affecting service.    ATandamp;T denies it pads its costs, but acknowledges it doesn't have any incentive to cut them under profit regulation. &quot;With price-cap regulation instead of rate-of-return, prices will go down more because we'll have the incentive to really try to be more efficient. We would pass some of that (savings) on to customers,&quot; says Wendell Lind, administrator of rates and tariffs for ATandamp;T.    But Mr. Goldberg says that even if ATandamp;T does pad its costs, the current regulatory system still does a better job of ensuring that the industry's declining costs are reflected in lower rates than a price-cap approach would. FCC studies say phone rates overall have only doubled since 1935 while overall prices have risen eightfold. With price-caps tied to an inflation index, Mr. Goldberg fears the caps will effectively become price floors for future increases.    The index could also be calculated to reflect cost-cutting by ATandamp;T, but consumer groups fear that the new system would become so complicated it wouldn't be any better than the current method.    Moreover, says Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, price caps would give ATandamp;T the incentive to target rate cuts rather than continue across-the-board cuts. For example, ATandamp;T could cut daytime rates while maintaining existing rates for nighttime and weekends, the time when residential use is heaviest. ATandamp;T notes that, even if this were the case, residential customers as well as business customers make calls during the day.    Critical to the whole debate is what ATandamp;T would be required to do about any future decreases in its costs to connect to local phone companies. It is the reduction in those costs that has spurred the majority of the price cuts anyway. Connection costs have been cut to offset an FCC-imposed local rate hike levied on consumers. In effect, the long-distance price cuts have resulted just from &quot;shifting money around in the system,&quot; says Mr. Kimmelman.    The last federally imposed local rate hike -- 30 cents a month -- is scheduled to go into effect in April 1989. Most likely, ATandamp;T will be forced to cut long-distance prices then by a couple of percentage points. But after that, says Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc. securities analyst, ATandamp;T under profit regulation wouldn't have any reason to keep cutting prices.    &quot;The only thing that would force ATandamp;T to lower prices is if they were over-earning, and we know they would manage&quot; earnings to avoid that, says Mr. Grubman.    Mr. Grubman predicts that the company wouldn't lower prices at all with continued profit caps. But he says ATandamp;T would keep lowering prices by 3% or 4% a year after 1989 under the price-cap system. Under that scenario, competitors would be worse off as they would have to match ATandamp;T's cuts. To attract customers, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co. believe they must continue to underprice ATandamp;T.    If what has happened to ATandamp;T's rates and profits in states that have removed profit-cap regulation is any indication of what could happen nationally, consumers will continue to see prices decline. And shareholders will see ATandamp;T profits soar.    In Maryland, for instance, prices for a five-minute daytime phone call within 100 miles have dropped 27% since profit caps were dropped 11 months ago, according to ATandamp;T. And what has happened to ATandamp;T's profits in the state? For the year ended March 31, 1987 the company says its earnings nearly doubled to $6.2 million, giving it a 48% return on its Maryland rate base. Says Thomas Cosgrove, an ATandamp;T district manager: &quot;From our perspective, this has been a winner for everyone.&quot;    ---                 Price Cuts Since The Breakup    Percentage reductions in basic long-distance servicecosts since the ATandamp;T breakup in January 1984.
