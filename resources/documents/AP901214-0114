WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former top aide to savings and loan ownerCharles H. Keating Jr. testified today that Sen. Donald Rieglearranged a meeting between senators and the top federal thriftregulator to discuss Keating's concerns. Riegle has denied settingup the meeting.   James Grogan, once corporate counsel to Keating's parentcompany, told the Senate Ethics Committee that Riegle suggested themeeting when he visited the Arizona facilities of Keating'sAmerican Continental Corp., and met privately with Keating.   Grogan testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.   The meeting, on April 2, 1987, was held by four senators withthen-top regulator Edwin J. Gray. Gray has charged that thesenators improperly pressured him in that session to drop aregulatory control of Lincoln Savings and Loan that Keating wasprotesting.   Riegle did not attend that meeting, and Grogan said he wassurprised by the senator's absence. Riegle did attend a meetingwith the other four senators and San Francisco-based regulators aweek later. Grogan said he urged Riegle to attend the secondmeeting and wanted ``to keep the team together,'' referring to thesenators.   Grogan also testified that Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., agreedto call Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, to arrange a meetingbetween the regulator and Keating in late 1987. Grogan said Keatingmade the request to Keating after Grogan delivered $250,000 inchecks for a voter-registration drive Cranston was supporting, andtogether they placed a call by speaker phone to Keating in Arizona.   Grogan said Riegle had suggested that the two Arizona senators,Democrat Dennis DeConcini and Republican John McCain, attend thesession with Gray on April 2. He said Riegle asked that the othersenators then invite him to attend.   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett asked Grogan, ``Isthere any doubt in your mind Senator Riegle agreed to arrange themeeting for the senators?''   Grogan replied, ``No, sir.''   Grogan recalled that Riegle said ``he would talk with Ed Grayand he thought he could set up a meeting ... and perhaps set up aprocess of disengaging from the feud or fighting that was goingon'' between Keating and the regulators.   Riegle, in earlier testimony before the committee in its KeatingFive hearings, denied setting up that meeting or one a week laterwith all five senators, including himself, and regulators.   ``No, I didn't arrange either meeting,'' Riegle has testified.   Grogan said that while Riegle and Keating met privately, he metwith Kevin Gotlieb, Riegle's staffer on the Senate BankingCommittee, and discussed a fundraiser Keating was organizing forRiegle in Detroit. Keating owned a prominent downtown hotel there.   Bennett asked Grogan, ``Did Senator Riegle ever tell you why hewanted you to ask Senator McCain to ask Senator Riegle to come tothe meeting?''   Grogan replied, ``It was apparent to me that ... Senator Riegleknew as a shrewd politician that this was a potentially politicallyexplosive situation because there was tremendous media at the timeabout Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray and the regulators and all thefighting.''   Grogan said that when he asked McCain, he refused to inviteRiegle but did agree ``to at least talk to Riegle about it.''   The panel granted Grogan limited immunity from prosecution tocompel his testimony about Keating's ties to five senators who havebeen accused of intervening improperly with federal thriftregulators on behalf of Keating's Lincoln Savings and LoanAssociation.   Grogan, 36, of Scottsdale, Ariz., gave his first publictestimony with his lawyer sitting behind him. None of the fivesenators under scrutiny was present.   Grogan said he had earned $300,000 a year working for Keating'scompany, before resigning last June. He described his relationswith Keating as ``strained.''   Keating had extensive contacts with the senators and theirstaffs. He was a big contributor to each lawmaker, and thecommittee is considering whether the $1.3 million he and associatesdonated to their campaigns and related political causes was tied totheir assistance.   Keating's parent company, American Continental Co., wentbankrupt in April 1989, and Lincoln was seized by federalregulators. The cost to taxpayers to cover insured deposits isexpected to top $2 billion, and Keating is under a state fraudindictment in California.   Grogan was vice president of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif.,and corporate counsel to American Continental, based in Phoenix.   The five senators are Republican John McCain of Arizona andDemocrats Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan.   Keating, Grogan and other aides invoked their Fifth Amendmentrights against self-incrimination in refusing to testify. Ingranting Grogan immunity to compel his testimony, the committeesaid it would not do so for Keating.   Evidence in the previous four weeks of public hearings has shownthat Grogan arranged for political donations to lawmakers and waspoint man in soliciting congressional help for Keating's ``all-outwar'' with regulators who were closing in on Lincoln.   A memo introduced into evidence last week showed that Keatingdirected Grogan to try to have a senior career regulator fired forhis tough actions against Lincoln.</TEXT></DOC>
