A few children and elderly people were terrified by a mortarattack on a police station, and police shot up a car, but therewere no additions to the 2,000-plus deaths caused by sectarianviolence since 1969.   There were several attacks on police stations. Charges werefiled against alleged members of the Irish Republican Army, whichis largely Roman Catholic and fighting to unite Ireland, and theUlster Volunteer Force, which is Protestant and wants to keep theprovince British.   These are the stories of a quiet week:   SUNDAY:   Masked gunmen crash a house party in Londonderry at 2:30 a.m.and fire four shots. Police say the homeowner was held with one gunin his mouth and another to his head while being interrogated abouta guest who already had left. No one is injured and no group claimsresponsibility.   A 36-year-old woman is hit in the head as automatic gunfiresprayed the Royal Ulster Constabulary's station at Clogher in thewestern part of the province. She survives and there are noinjuries to police, who attribute the late-night attack to the IRA.   MONDAY:   IRA commandos fire three mortar rounds at the Ballynafeighpolice station in south Belfast as children walk to school. Elderlyresidents are evacuated from their homes, past a can in which abomb explodes minutes later. No one is injured.   A van used in the attack is stolen from Francis McCusker, who isheld captive by gunmen, along with his wife, Maureen, and twochildren, for three hours during the attack.   TUESDAY:   A funeral is held for taxi driver William Thompson, 26, who wasshot to death the previous Friday night. The IRA claims Thompsonhad been involved in sectarian killings.   In Armagh, Dermot Carroll, 26, and Niall Carroll, 22, arecharged with setting off a homemade 50-pound bomb the previousFriday while a British Army patrol was nearby.   An 18-year-old man from west Belfast is shot in both ankles andknees. Police say it appears to be a punishment shooting, the IRA'sway of dealing with people in the Catholic community whom itconsiders criminals.   The chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary agrees topay a ``four-figure'' settlement to a Catholic councilman fromLondonderry who claimed he was repeatedly assaulted while detainedin 1977.   WEDNESDAY:   Bombs explode at the Springfield Road police station and NorthHoward Street army post, and shots are fired at security forcepatrols in three other areas of Belfast. No casualties are reported.   Alex Atwood, a member of the Belfast city council from theSocial Democratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic politicalparty, says army tactics are creating tension in west Belfast.``People talking to neighbors or passing the time of day on theirown doorstep have been treated with contempt by some patrol membersand subjected to verbal abuse.'' An army spokesman promises aninvestigation.   The McCuskers are charged with withholding information abouttheir stolen van.   THURSDAY:   The McCuskers are released on bail.   FRIDAY:   Police fire 30 shots at a stolen car that allegedly is driventhrough a checkpoint in west Belfast at 1 a.m. Two occupants areseriously injured. Councilor Alex Attwood of the SDLP says he fearsthe incident reflects ``this hostility where people shoot first andask questions afterwards.''

James Branagh, 45, of Ardoyne, is sentenced to five years inprison after being convicted of membership in the IRA andpossessing a nail bomb and documents useful to terrorists.Prosecutors say Branagh would leave his back door unlocked, knowingthe IRA was using his home to store weapons.
