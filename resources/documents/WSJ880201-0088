A presidential selection process that began in confusion 18 months ago in Michigan ended in confusion over the weekend. The official state convention in Grand Rapids awarded 37 delegates to Mr. Bush, 32 to Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and eight to former religious-broadcaster Pat Robertson. Kansas Sen. Robert Dole didn't compete in the process.    The acrimony that has divided the Michigan GOP since August 1986 spilled over into the state convention, with Mr. Robertson's forces protesting they were robbed of delegates, holding their own convention and awarding their candidate 43 delegates.    Mr. Bush, facing the prospect of losing to Sen. Dole in next Monday's Iowa caucuses, hailed his Michigan victory as a &quot;big, clear win.&quot; Mr. Robertson's forces, who control the state's GOP central committee, said they will continue this battle through the spring and summer. </TEXT></DOC>
