Maybe the deer will die, but sooner Bambi than my son.&quot;    Having heard environmentalists' reports that garbage incinerators could endanger the health of those nearby, Mrs. Heywood has joined a citizens' group protesting the incinerator, even though local officials insist it is perfectly safe.    Countless communities across the country are similarly embroiled, as garbage problems escalate and harried municipal officials embrace trash burning as their best hope. Some 110 municipal incinerators are already operating, with another 210 under construction or planned for the next several years. Experts say that in another decade, most American cities will have built or planned for an incinerator.    Contradictory claims by environmentalists and incinerator builders make it hard to know what to believe. Most of these experts &quot;have an ax to grind,&quot; complains Sue Kelly of Bedford, N.Y., who recently organized a forum on garbage burning for her local garden club.    Still, both the environmentalists and incinerator builders agree on several points. Trash burning, they say, is a technology with real health risks. Still, it is preferable to other methods of trash disposal, and the health risks can be considerably lessened if proper procedures are followed.    Burning is less harmful, for example, than burying, says Frank McManus, publisher of the trade newsletter Resource Recovery Report. And yet 90% of the 400,000 tons of trash disposed of in the U.S. daily is buried. Even recycling, which some see as a panacea, has some health risks.    Less dangerous it may be, but federal officials are increasingly aware that burning must be done under strictly controlled conditions. Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the existing incinerators together cause between three and 38 cancer cases a year through inhalation of highly toxic dioxin emissions. The EPA also found that other chemicals, metals and acid gases emitted by incinerators &quot;pose health and environmental risks, based on lifetime exposures.&quot;    The EPA's proposed regulations, which focus on air-pollution controls, should significantly reduce those risks. But they aren't scheduled to take effect until 1991, by which time dozens of incinerators may have been built without the extra emission-control equipment, which can add 10% or more to the cost of a facility.    Moreover, retrofitting existing facilities will be at the discretion of the states. That's ironic, given that EPA acted only after three states (New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island) petitioned the agency to establish federal emission standards because they were worried about other states' lax standards.    &quot;There are a few clunkers (incinerators) out there,&quot; says Anthony Licata, vice president, technology, for Dravo Corp.'s Dravo Energy Resources unit, which builds incinerators.    Some of those in the pro-incinerator camp say the problem isn't incinerators themselves, but the people who run them. Steven Jaasund, president of Jaasund AirTech Inc., a Mesa, Ariz.-based seller of air pollution-control equipment, says: &quot;The (pollution-control) devices are getting very good. Unfortunately, (incinerator) operators don't maintain them properly.&quot;    Training is the weak link, says Mr. Jaasund. Operators &quot;need a background in chemical engineering&quot; to solve the typical problems that arise, he says.    In other countries, the training is often extensive. German incinerator operators devote six months' classroom study to combustion efficiency and dioxin formation and reduction, says Allen Hershkowitz. As solid-waste research director for the New York nonprofit group INFORM, Mr. Hershkowitz has studied garbage disposal in Europe and Japan. The German program, he says, which also includes two years of on-site training, is run by the German Boiler Manufacturers Association. By contrast, Mr. Hershkowitz says, the U.S. has no training institute, although the American Society of Mechanical Engineers is working to establish one.    Even if operators are trained and the latest pollution-control devices are used, an incinerator can still become a health risk if the garbage is burned improperly. The key is a fire that burns evenly at a high temperature; anything less creates excess dioxins, metal residues and other pollutants. Mr. Jaasund, the maker of pollution-control equipment, says operators must first homogenize and pulverize the garbage so that the waste can be fed into the boiler evenly. Unfortunately, he adds, at many incinerators, operators &quot;just throw it all in.&quot;    When garbage is burnt, the ash residue roughly equals about 10% of the original volume. That ash must be buried in a landfill -- a process that poses perhaps the most serious health risk related to incinerators.    &quot;You don't want to mix ash and ordinary garbage,&quot; says Dravo's Mr. Licata, because toxic metals including lead can leach into the ground and air. Yet, says Mr. Licata, most incinerator ash is currently mixed with ordinary garbage, due to a scarcity of new landfills dedicated to ash.    Mr. Licata says Dravo has a large research project under way to find what he calls a &quot;magic powder dust.&quot; The dust, which he describes as similar to concrete hardeners, would be mixed with the ash to immobilize the metals in it and prevent them from leaching. The Japanese frequently mix their ash with cement, says Mr. Licata, but Dravo hopes to have something less bulky out, perhaps before the end of this year.    Still, whatever the risk of garbage burning, &quot;the alternative -- landfill -- is worse,&quot; says Mr. McManus, the publisher of Resource Recovery Report. Indeed, many older landfills weren't properly constructed to contain the toxic substances now leaching from decaying trash. In many states, water and air quality is threatened. New York City's Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, for one, dumps four million gallons of toxic liquid into nearby freshwater streams every day. </TEXT></DOC>
