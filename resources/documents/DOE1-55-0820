Retention increasedproportionately in liver, kidney and carcass. The concentration of theactinides excreted also increased substantially (over that of controls)in the urine of iron-deficient rats gavaged with {sup 233}U and {sup237}Np, but not in those with {sup 241}Am or {sup 244}Cm. Weanling ratson an iron-deficient diet, gavaged with ferric nitrate immediately beforeadministration of {sup 238}Pu nitrate, retained between 4% and 12% ofthe {sup 238}Pu retained by litter mates that were not treated intragastricallywith iron.</TEXT></DOC>
