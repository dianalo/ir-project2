However, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade continued to demand compensation for losses stemming from delayed or suspended contracts, the official Xinhua news agency reported.    Last May, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry imposed a one-year ban on Toshiba Machine's exports to communist nations following the disclosure that the company had sold sophisticated milling equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of Western-bloc rules governing exports to communist countries. The U.S. said that the Soviets used the machines to make ultraquiet submarine propellers that made detection of the vessels more difficult.    The Chinese ministry said that the May ruling &quot;victimized&quot; China in regard to 25 contracts involving Toshiba exports, and that $900 million in Chinese contracts signed with other Japanese concerns were stalled because of tightened Japanese export restrictions. </TEXT></DOC>
