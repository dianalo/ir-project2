 However, the Eastern Europeanmarket will not be as easy to enter as some companies envision itto be, because the number of microcomputers is still low, andmoney is being spent on hardware, not software.andP;

 And now, after years of helplessly watching theirproducts being pirated throughout the communist world, major softwarecompanies can look forward to greater copyright protection.andP;  No wonder Novellis calling Eastern Europe &quot;the next big thing&quot;.andM;&quot;There are around 400 million people in Eastern Europe and Russia -- which israther more than in Western Europe,&quot; says Andrew Zoltowski, Novell'sPolish-born director for the Eastern European region.andP;  &quot;But there are onlyhalf a million PCs there.andP;  It's the last major market for PCs and thereforefor LANs.andP;  We only started shipping NetWare to Eastern Europe in Februarylast year, but sales are already well into seven figures, and the rate isincreasing.andM;&quot;Until three years ago the feeling was that copyright was a nasty capitalisttrick,&quot; added Zoltowski.andP;  &quot;But the governments in all those countries haveaccepted the need for copyright protection, and the laws are coming in.&quot;andM;Bernard Vergnes, Microsoft's European operations manager, echoed the point:&quot;There have been a number of conferences organized by the Soviet governmenton the subject of software protection, so they have an understanding of theimportance of regulations in this area.andM;&quot;And we've been through the same problems elsewhere.andP;  Four or five years agoin Spain, software wasn't so widely available, and the price was highrelative to the average income -- and in Eastern Europe there's the addedproblem of the shortage of hard currency.andP;  As you can see from Spain,attitudes change, and I trust they will do so in the East.&quot;andM;However, Vergnes had a word of caution: &quot;There's a misconception that,because the Berlin Wall is down, suddenly you're going to sell the hell outof those countries.andP;  But the number of PCs isn't high, and the available hardcurrency for high technology is being used for PCs and not software.andP;  Therecent changes don't make them any richer, and it will be an uphill fight.&quot;andM;Ashton-Tate has also recognized the growth of opportunity in Eastern Europe.andO;It has set up a London-based venture group, is developing distributors, andhas signed an accord with the Soviet government for a code of ethics coveringsoftware protection.andP;  But, like Microsoft, the company is cautious.andM;According to Herman Delatte, Aandamp;T's Madrid-based managing director forSouthern and Eastern Europe, &quot;Everything is still on a deal by deal basis.andO;Anything could happen -- from political upheavals to new export restraints.andO;We're putting people in place to handle the new markets, but we can alwaysredeploy them again.&quot;andM;And Novell's Zoltowski points out, &quot;It's good that governments are on ourside, but the application of the law is a whole different thing.andP;  People arestill aware that non-legitimate software is cheaper and more accessible, andthe mechanisms for suing people are very poor.&quot;andM;Novell is unusual among software companies in being hit by restrictions drawnup by Cocom, the committee of 17 western allies which restrains the sale ofhigh technology products -- usually hardware -- to the East.andM;However, in advance of a Cocom meeting in Paris in mid-February, Novell islobbying in Washington for a relaxation of the current regulations whichrequire the company to obtain an export license for every NetWare system itinstalls.andM;And a relaxation in trade restraints is already underway, following the lastCocom meeting in August.andP;  According to a spokesman at the Department of Tradeand Industry, &quot;Before August you basically couldn't export anything aboveSpectrum level to the Eastern bloc without an export licence, but now mostIBM compatibles don't require a licence.&quot;andP;  However, the current Cocom rulesdecree that the most powerful PC processor that can be exported is still onlya 16MHz 286.andM;Further changes look likely, though, after statements by senior members ofthe US administration this January revealed a radical change of tone.andP;  The USlooks to be softening its previous hard line under pressure from its Europeanallies.andM;Speaking from Washington, a spokesman at the Department of Commerce refusedto itemise the likely areas of relaxation, but his opposite number in the UKDepartment of Trade and Industry said that, &quot;there's pressure to allow freesales of all 32-bit processors.andP;  That would certainly be a next logicalstep.&quot;andM;The UK government is in favour of such a move, said the DTI spokesman.andO;&quot;That's what we're going to Paris to support.andP;  But Cocom is a consensus andit depends on what all the others think.&quot;andP;  He added that it would beinappropriate for Cocom to change the rules such that &quot;anything goes&quot;.andP;  Headded, &quot;Anyway, the fact that an export licence is required doesn't mean thatthere's an embargo.andP;  It's just that we and other Cocom signatories canmonitor end use for items which could have military or high techapplications.&quot;andM;However, Novell's Zoltowski believes that any such regulations encourage greyimporting and piracy: &quot;Because there's licensing hassle, people just say,'Well, there's Charlie down the road and he'll get me a copy and I'll justtake it over in the back of the car.'andP;  That accounts for 90 per cent of ourinstalled base in the East: people don't want to wait four months.andP;  And oneway of cleaning up the market is by opening up legal channels,&quot; he said.andM;Asked if Novell was being obliged to form distribution agreements withcompanies which had previously grey-imported NetWare, Zoltowskidiplomatically said, &quot;We're working with dealers and systems houses who havegrown large in the environment.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
