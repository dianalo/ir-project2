(customer relations).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Topic:     WarrantyCustomer Relations.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By DON CRABBandM;Well now.andP;  Apple is reconsidering its 90-day wonders.andP;  You know what theyare.andP;  They're euphemistically called warranties.andP;  What a joke that is.andP;  I geta longer warranty when I buy a toaster.andM;I couldn't believe it when I read in MacWEEK that Bill Coldrick, Apple USAsenior vice president of sales, said, &quot;To be competitive, we've found apersonal computer maker needs to offer a one-year warranty.&quot; What arevelation.andP;  Is this something that one of Apple's vaunted focus groupsbrought to the fore?andM;Give me a break.andP;  If Apple wanted to find out about the importance ofwarranty policies and service, all it had to do was ask any Mac manager.andO;Anytime.andP;  Anywhere.andM;I love the reasons that analysts have for Apple's warranty reticence.andP;  Here'sa gem: &quot;They don't need it; they sell all the Macs they can anyway.&quot; Or howabout, &quot;People would buy Macintoshes even if they had no warranty at all,because they love that Macintosh interface.&quot;?andM;This is really deep thinking.andM;But do you believe it?andP;  If Apple does, we had better start calling thiscolumn The PC Manager, because that's what we will all be using in fiveyears.andM;Apparently, some great lightning bolt has finally struck Cupertino (or maybejust a quake aftershock), and now Apple is thinking about a new warrantyprogram.andP;  I'd like to believe it's because Apple wants to do the best for itscustomers.andM;But I know that's just not true.andP;  Apple is &quot;thinking&quot; about revising itswarranty program because it's starting to feel the heat from customers miffedabout prematurely croaking hard disks.andP;  Sadly, it's a purely market-drivenresponse.andM;If Apple had instituted a decent warranty program years ago, the equipmentmalfunctions would hardly have caused a titter among customers or the press.andO;Now it's faced with a cleanup action that doesn't say much for Apple'sconcern for the customer.andM;This should be a no-brainer for Apple.andP;  A one-year limited parts-and-laborwarranty is standard among personal computer vendors.andP;  Apple should at leastbuy in at the one-year level, but if it really wants to stand behind itsequipment and support all the Macintosh managers who bought Apple's message,Apple should opt for a warranty that covers two years.andM;So what's holding things up?andP;  This is not a sales issue, Apple.andP;  I don't carea whit whether you sell one more box because you have a better warranty.andP;  Macmanagers don't care, either.andP;  Instead, we care that our expensive investmentin Mac hardware doesn't turn into a maintenance nightmare because we wereunlucky enough to get the shipment of Macs with the stinko hard disks or theloose CPUs or the slightly misaligned cases or the bent I/O ports or ...andM;It's really an issue of corporate morality on Apple's part.andP;  With Apple'sgreater emphasis on design-for-manufacturing and on modular designs andsurface-mounted electronics, Apple hardware is bound to become more reliablein the 1990s.andP;  I can't imagine that Apple is holding back on a decentwarranty for its U.S.andP;  customers because it expects to pay out on failedmachines.andP;  If that were the case, Apple wouldn't be offering the one-yearwarranties it does in Europe.andM;Nope.andP;  This whole business seems to be one of those dumb issues thatmarketing and sales types have kicked around for years, while Mac customers,Mac users and Mac managers have had to waste money on AppleCare and otherdealer extended warranties.andM;It's time that this nonsense ended.andP;  Warranties protect us all.andP;  Apple won'tlose customers just because they were unlucky enough to get some badMacintoshes.andP;  Users can fall back on the manufacturer for guaran-teed repairsof faulty machines.andP;  And Mac managers won't have to waste their budgets onAppleCare or in-house maintenance programs.andM;And with a two-year parts-and-labor limited warranty, Apple will once againset itself apart from the rest of the personal computing industry with itscommitment to excellence.andP;  And Apple will have done the right thing in theright way for its customers.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
