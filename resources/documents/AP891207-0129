(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The citrus canker scare that led to theburning of 20 million fruit trees in the mid-1980s reached thestate's highest court Thursday, with growers arguing that acompensation plan violates their rights.   Attorneys for citrus growers and nursery owners told the FloridaSupreme Court that a law passed by the Legislature last springproviding a $30 million compensation fund and setting up anadministrative hearing procedure denied them the right to havetheir day in court.   Claims pending before the state list damages of at least $200million.   Jim Moody, one of three citrus industry attorneys, said the planwas wrong because the Legislature also made the decisions leadingto the burning of the trees. Under basic separation of powersprotections, he said, the courts are the correct forum for settlingon payment for losses.   ``The Constitution is what protects us from our owngovernment,'' Moody said. ``Are we going to let those taking theproperty determine the compensation for the property? The answer isno.''   Millions of citrus trees, mostly seedlings, were destroyedbeginning in 1984 to halt the spread of canker, a disease that canlead to premature fruit drop and loss of the crop.   Scientists have since concluded that most of the trees diagnosedwith canker were suffering from a relatively harmless leaf-spottingdisease, and most regulations aimed at preventing the spread ofcanker have been dropped.   Lower courts supported the state's authority to destroy thetrees because of fears that a serious disease was threatening thestate's $1 billion citrus industry. But courts also have ruled thatfull compensation for destroyed trees is required.   Attorney General Bob Butterworth said there are about 1,100claims stemming from the canker eradication program. If thoseclaims were taken to court, Butterworth said, it could cost thestate at least $200 million.   Seventy-six canker compensation cases have been filed in courtsaround the state, but the law passed last spring freezes them anddirects they also go through an administrative process.   A Hillsborough County judge ruled the law unconstitutional oneday after it was signed by Gov. Bob Martinez, and the stateappealed.   Robert Shevin, a former state attorney general representing theLegislature, said the compensation program gives growers a way topress their claims in a reasonable way.   ``We admit liability. We pay these folks,'' Shevin said. ``Webelieve we've provided an adequate alternative remedy that hasadequate safeguards to ensure just compensation.''   Another government attorney, Parker Thomson, said the systemkeeps intact growers' constitutional rights to a hearing.   ``I submit that there is no substantive right diminished, muchless taken away by this statute,'' said Thomson, representingButterworth.   Moody and Steven Turner, another citrus industry attorney, saidthe Florida Constitution protects a property owner's right tocompensation when property is seized by government, but moreimportantly mandates that such a decision be made in a court.   Turner also said the law should not be applied retroactively toclaims that already had been filed in state courts.   The justices did not indicate when they would rule.</TEXT></DOC>
