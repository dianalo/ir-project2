(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford told a federal courtMonday that he has decided not to call any defense witnesses in histrial on charges he took political payoffs from bankers.   ``We're going to send it to the jury and let the jury decide,''Ford said as he left the courtroom where he has been on trial sinceFeb. 12.   The 44-year-old Memphis Democrat is being tried on charges ofconspiracy, bank fraud and mail fraud. He is accused of takingpayoffs from former Tennessee bankers Jake and brother C.H. ButcherJr.   Prosecutors surprised defense lawyers and courtroom spectatorslast week by resting their case without calling C.H. Butcher, whohad been expected to be a star witness against Ford.   Butcher, charged with Ford in 1987, has pleaded guilty toconspiring with him to commit bank and mail fraud.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Clancy declined to comment on hisdecision not to summon Butcher.   Ford is being tried with three former Butcher aides: accountantDavid Crabtree and laywers Douglas Beaty and Karl Schledwitz.   The congressman's co-defendants also announced they were readyto turn the case over the jury following final arguments.   Before resting their case, defense lawyers asked U.S. DistrictJudge Odell Horton for a direct verdict of acquittal, saying theprosecution had fallen well short of proving its case. Hortondenied the motion.   Defense and prosecution lawyers are scheduled to discussprocedural matters Tuesday afternoon with Horton. Final argumentsare expected to begin Wednesday.   Government lawyers called 29 witnesses who outlined acomplicated series of loans to Ford from lending institutions oncerun by the Butchers.   Most of those loans were without collateral or adequatefinancial statements, and Ford made few if any payments on themuntil the Butchers' banking empire collapsed in 1983, witnessessaid.   The Butchers set off the largest banking collapse in Tennesseehistory and are serving 20-year bank fraud sentences in federalprison.   Government witnesses said Ford's loans were moved from bank tobank, apparently to hide them from federal examiners. Many of theloans eventually ended up at C.H. Butcher's Southern IndustrialBanking Corp., a state-chartered finance company.   A federal bank examiner described SIBC as a ``dumping ground''for bad loans issued by the Butchers.   The government says Ford got some $1 million in Butcher loansbetween 1976 and 1982, but he puts the loan total at $650,000. Fordsaid the loans have been settled since 1983.   He paid a bankruptcy trustee $25,000 in 1983 to settle hisobligations stemming from a $350,000 loan from SIBC to a companycalled Tenn-Ford Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
