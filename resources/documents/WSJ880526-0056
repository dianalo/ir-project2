The draft legislation would ask Congress to alter immigration rules to expedite legalization for undocumented spouses and children of permanently legalized amnesty applicants. About 1.5 million undocumented immigrants applied for amnesty in the year-long application period that ended May 4, but many have immediate family members who don't qualify for legalization.    A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said that the proposal would affect only those immigrants who gain permanent resident status, not those who have qualified for temporary residency.    The special visas would allow those immigrants' relatives to circumvent standard immigration channels, which can require a waiting period of as much as 10 years. The plan would offer legal status to about 200,000 additional people, the INS said.    The draft legislation, which also proposes increasing the number of total immigrants to 650,000 a year from 490,000, must be submitted to the Justice Department for review before it is presented to Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
