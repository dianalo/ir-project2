Background</ITAG>Many individuals require intravenous (IV) drug therapy on an ongoing basiseither because the medication is not available in oral dosage form, thepatient is unable to take the medication orally, or the medication is moreeffective if administered intravenously. Most of these individuals requirehospitalization for the initiation of IV drug therapy and many must remainhospitalized for the duration of the therapy. There is, however, an increasingnumber of individuals whose IV drug therapy care, in whole or in part,can be managed at home. Allowing these patients to receive drug therapyat home rather than in the hospital can improve the quality of their livesand potentially allow their return to normal activities. In addition, homeIV drug therapy may be less expensive than IV drug therapy furnished inan institutional setting. Currently, outside of the hospital setting, the Medicare program generallycovers only those drugs (including IV drugs) and biologicals that cannotbe self-administered and that are furnished incident to a physician's professionalservices. These items are included in the definition of ``medical and otherhealth services'' (section 1861(s) of the Act) and are covered under theSupplementary Medical Insurance program (Part B of Medicare). Provisionof IV drug therapy could be a covered service incident to a physician'sservices if furnished in a physician's office or hospital outpatient department.While drugs are not covered under Medicare's home health benefit, skillednursing care in connection with administration of drugs currently may becovered under the home health benefit. However, in these cases, the homehealth benefit. However, in these cases, the beneficiary must otherwisequalify for home health services, which, among other things, requires thatthe beneficiary be in need of only part-time or intermittent skilled nursingcare (42 CFR 410.80 and 409.40). In general, then, services associatedwith administration of IV drugs in the home and the drugs themselves havenot been covered by the Medicare program unless a physician is presentand furnishing or directly supervising the therapy, or unless a registerednurse inserts the IV needle as part of home health benefits (though nocoverage of the IV drugs is currently available). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. New Legislation</ITAG>Section 203 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L.100-360), enacted on July 1, 1988, establishes, as a new Part B benefitfor Medicare beneficiaries, coverage of home IV drug therapy services beginningJanuary 1, 1990. In addition, section 202 of Public Law 100-360 sets forththe provisions governing coverage and payment of outpatient drugs includingdrugs used in home IV drug therapy. Section 203(a) of Public Law 100-360amended section 1832(a)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) to providefor coverage under Part B of home IV drug therapy services furnished onor after January 1, 1990. Section 203(b) of Public Law 100-360 added section1861(jj) to the Act to define home IV drug therapy services. Thus, undersection 1861(jj)(2) of the Act, home IV drug therapy services means ``** * nursing, pharmacy, and related services (including medical supplies,intravenous fluids, delivery, and equipment) as are necessary to conductsafely and effectively an intravenously administered drug regimen. * **'' As provided in section 1861(jj)(1) of the Act, home IV drug therapyservices are to be ``* * * furnished to an individual who is under thecare of a physician_(A) in a place of residence used as such individual'shome; (B) by a qualified home intravenous drug therapy provider * * * orby others under arrangements with them made by such provider; and (C) undera plan established and periodically reviewed by a physician.''Section 203(c)(1)(F) of Public Law 100-360 added sections 1834(d) (1) and(2) of the Act, which govern payment for home IV drug therapy services.Section 1834(d)(1) of the Act requires that payment for these servicesbe equal to the lower of actual charges or a fee schedule developed bythe Secretary under the provisions of section 1834(d)(2) of the Act. Becausesection 203(c)(1) of Public Law 100-360 amended sections 1833(a)(2) and(b) of the Act to exempt payment for home IV drug therapy services fromthe customary Part B coinsurance and deductible requirements and section1834(d) of the Act makes no provision for either coinsurance or a deductibleamount, payment for home IV drug therapy services is to be made at 100percent of the lower of actual charges or the fee schedule amount. Section1834(d)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish by regulations,before the beginning of 1990 and before the beginning of each subsequentyear, a fee schedule determined on a per diem basis.Although section 1834(d)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to establisha per diem fee schedule for home IV drug therapy services, no specificformula is provided. However, the Conference Report that accompanied PublicLaw 100-360 indicates congressional intent that the Secretary ``* * * couldconsider cost information, charge information, and payment rates for similaritems and services covered under Medicare. The Secretary could not, however,require routine cost reporting * * *'' (H.R. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong.,2nd Sess. 202 (1988).) In addition, the Conference Report provides theSecretary with ``* * * broad flexibility in establishing the fee schedule.The conferees expect that the Secretary will use this flexibility to establisha fee schedule which assures adequate access to services while preventingexcessive payments. The conferees note that exclusive reliance on customarycharges has previously resulted in excessive reimbursement levels for similarservices * * *.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess. 202 (1988).)Therefore, to establish a fee schedule that assures adequate access toservices while preventing excessive payments, the Secretary may considercost information, charge information, and payment rates for similar itemsand services covered under Medicare in order to arrive at reasonable allowances.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of This Proposed Rule</ITAG>Under this proposed rule, for services furnished in 1990, we would establishtwo per diem fee schedules for home IV drug therapy services and allowancesthat would be added to the fee schedules to cover special costs associatedwith home IV drug therapy services. One fee schedule would apply to painmanagement therapy and the second fee schedule would apply to antibioticsand all other IV drug therapies. We intend to periodically review the ratesand allowances and we will be considering methods to update the rates andallowances once they are established (for example, through use of the consumerprice index for urban consumers (CPI-U), or other data showing changesin salaries and other costs).To develop an appropriate payment level for home IV drug therapy services,we first looked at existing models of payment for similar Medicare benefits.We gathered additional information by searching the available literatureon home IV drug therapy and carefully reviewing relevant articles. We alsovisited (both onsite and offsite) with numerous entities that furnish homeIV drug therapy. In addition, we consulted trade associations representingentities that furnish home IV drug therapy, supplier representatives, andthird-party payors.As a result of our research, we made two major decisions: first, we decidedthat payment should be based, to the greatest extent possible, on costdata rather than charge data, and second, we decided that we should constructa fee schedule for each of the two major drug therapies, antibiotic therapyand pain management therapy. These decisions were made after careful considerationof the many factors affecting the cost of providing IV drug therapy servicesand supplies in the home.First, we found very wide variances in charges among home IV drug therapyproviders for comparable services. In our review of the literature, wealso found a number of cost analyses for IV drug therapy provided in thehospital setting as well as references to cost comparisons between hospitalinpatient and home-based IV drug therapy. The combination of data containedin these studies and the broad range of provider charges led us to believethat there is a tenuous relationship between costs and charges and thatbasing a fee schedule on charging patterns would result in excessive paymentlevels.Second, based on a review of home IV drug therapy trade-related literature,we expect that the bulk of home IV drug therapy services provided to Medicarepatients would be associated with antibiotics and pain management.Because of a substantial difference between the cost of furnishing thetwo major IV drug therapies, we are proposing two separate fee schedules.If we were to employ only one fee schedule, we would inevitably eitherunderpay or overpay any drug therapy provider whose patient mix is differentfrom the estimated national patient mix described in the Regulatory ImpactStatement, section VI, below. We believe that using a separate fee schedulefor each of the major IV drug therapies would be more equitable and accuratefor both the providers and the Medicare program.Therefore, for purposes of payment under this proposed rule, we have groupedhome IV drug therapies into two major groups, antibiotics and pain managementtherapies. We beleve that this approach would be reasonable since we expectthat the overwhelming majority of Medicare beneficiaries who will undergohome IV drug therapy will receive antibiotics or analgesics for pain management.Our expectation is based on statistics that indicate that hydration andall other drug therapies except for antibiotics and pain management representa nominal share of the current market for home IV drug therapies.\1\<NOTE/> Consequently, in addition to those drugs clearly classifiedas antibiotics in the proposed list of covered home IV drugs publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 8, 1989 (54 FR 37239), payment wouldalso be made under the antibiotic fee schedule for all other types of drugtherapy except for pain management. That is, the antibiotic therapy feeschedule would be used for determining payment for the following drug therapies:antibiotics, anti-infectives, fluid replacement drugs used for hydrationtherapy, and non-antibiotic drugs classified (at 54 FR 37246) as ``other''than anti-infectives, drugs used for hydration therapy, or pain managementdrugs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``Home Infusions Therapy Industry: Robush Growth Prospects'',<T3>Prudential-Bache Health Care Industry Report,</T3> September 20, 1988,Table 1.In addition, payment would be made under the antibiotic fee schedule forIV biologicals classified (at 54 FR 37248) as ``other'' than anti-infectives,fluid replacement drugs, pain management drugs, or anti-cancer chemotherapeuticdrugs. Therefore, in summary, reference in this document to the antibioticfee schedule applies to drugs used for all drug therapies other than painmanagement therapy.Based on our research, we reached the following conclusions about the provisionof home IV drug therapy services (that is, all the services and items necessaryfor the provision of the home IV drug therapy except the actual drugs thatare infused):andbullet; Pharmacy services comprise two major functions: Clinical and distributive.Clinical services include drug therapy monitoring, development of medicationhistories and patient profiles, consultation with physicians and nurses,drug-use evaluation, and quality assurance. Distributive services are thoseactivities directly associated with the dispensing of drugs, for example,drug procurement and inventory, drug reconstitution, dosage preparationn,labeling, and related administrative duties. The intensity of pharmacyand related services is based mainly on the dosage required by each patientfor each drug and the shelf life of the drug (including reconstituted drugs).For example, the drug's shelf life is the primary factor in the frequencyof drug preparation and delivery to the patient's home.andbullet; Nursing services incude both direct patient care and indirectpatient care. Direct patient care services include assessing the patient'scondition, changing IV sites and dressings, and drawing blood for laboratoryanalysis. Indirect patient care includes travel to and from the patient'shome and arranging for the provision of emergency services on a 24-hour-per-daybasis. The intensity of nursing and related services is based mainly uponthe patient's condition and type of venous access.andbullet; Supplies are pharmaceutical materials needed to provide a homeIV therapy drug program; that is, materials used to compound a drug, toreconstitute powdered drugs, and to adminiser drug infusions. Suppliesused in the administration of drug infusions include all IV fluids, forexample, dextrose and saline solutions used as diluents, heparin, heparinlocks, and saline flushes, in addition to minibags, tubing, syringes, needles,and miscellaneous supplies such as sterile gloves, gauze, and swabs. Wenote that, although IV fluids are legend drugs, we would pay for them underthe methodology set forth in this document; that is, as part of the paymentfor home IV drug therapy services rather than as covered home IV drugs.The only exceptions to this policy would be in the case of a fluid thatis used either as the drug of choice to treat medical problems caused bydehydration or to hydrate patients before and after the administrationof another drug to avoid medical problems that could arise from administrationof that drug. That is, if IV fluids are administered by themselves forhydration purposes, they are covered and paid for as drugs under the drugpayment methodology set forth in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking.andbullet; Equipment used in home IV drug therapy is generally limited toIV poles and infusion pumps.Based on the knowledge gained from our review of available literature andconsultations with entries that furnish home IV drug therapy services,related trade associations, medical suppliers, and third-party payors,we developed for each of the two major therapies a basic fee schedule coveringthe per diem costs of a package of ongoing home IV therapy services, includingsupplies and equipment. We would supplement the basic per diem fee schedulewith additional adjustments that reflect one-time expenses and other variables.In this document, we use the term ``allowance'' to refer to each componentof the fee schedule and the additional adjustments.One-time expenses reflect those services that are nonrecurring in natureand, therefore, are unlike many other home IV drug therapy services thatcontinue for the entire duration of the home IV drug therapy. One exampleof a nonrecurring service is patient education and counseling, which wouldoccur as the beneficiary begins the course of home IV drug therapy.We would also provide allowances for other variables because we recognizethat there are additional costs associated with patients who, for example,are on multiple drug regimens (that is, receiving two or more drugs intravenously).Due to the unavailability of relevant data, except for nursing labor costs,these proposed fee schedule allowances do not include an adjustment forcosts based on geographic area (that is urban or rural or State-to-Statevariations). We are particularly interested in receiving public commentsconcerning the differences in cost and other factors in urban and ruralareas.The basic fee schedule would reflect the per diem cost of the total packageof services, supplies, and equipment provided to a home IV drug therapypatient.For antibiotic therapy, we are proposing a basic per diem fee scheduleamount of $45.44 to cover the total cost of pharmacy services, pharmacysupplies (including IV fluids), and pharmacy delivery service; nursingservices and nursing supplies; and other patient equipment needs. We areproposing a per diem fee schedule amount of $31.63 to cover comparablecosts associated with the furnishing of pain management therapy.We note that payment for all home IV drug therapy services, including pharmacyservices, is provided under the provisions of section 203 of Public Law100-360, as would be implemented by this proposed rule. Section 202 ofPublic Law 100-360, which establishes the payment methodology for coveredoutpatient drugs, includes as part of the payment calculation for eachdrug an administrative allowance, which represents a pharmacy's dispensingfee. As set forth in the proposed rule that would implement the paymentprovisions of section 202 of Public Law 100-360, no administrative allowancewould be paid for dispensing a covered home IV drug, since compensationfor that activity is included in the payment methodology set forth in thisproposed rule for home IV drug therapy services.The basic fee schedule allowance would represent an aggregate per diempayment for the package of home IV therapy services. It is comprised ofdiscrete components that would be subject to the application of a geographicwage index or other adjustments, or both, as described below in this preamble.For the convenience of the reader, set forth below is an itemization ofthe individual allowances contained in the proposed basic fee schedulesand the additional adjustments for one-time or patient-specific expenses.The assumptions we used in determining these allowances are briefly identifiedin the first column. These assumptions are described in detail in the discussionset forth below in this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Home IV Antibotic Therapy Services Per Diem Fee Schedule </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Amounts may not equal the sum of the values due to rounding]</ITAG><H1>Assumptions</H1><H1>Pharmacy services</H1><H1>Nursing services</H1><H1>Supplies/mileage</H1><H1>Equipment</H1><H1>Total per diem</H1>Pharmacy services andamp;

Under section203(d)(1) of Public Law 100-360, which amended section 1835(a)(2) of theAct, home IV drug therapy services initiated before January 1, 1993, mustbe authorized by the PRO prior to their provision. We are preparing a separatenotice of proposed rulemaking implementing the provisions of section 203(d)of Public Law 100-360.A single bill (HCFA Form 1450) will be submitted by the home IV drug therapyprovider. This bill will include both the separate charges for the IV drug(which will be paid under the covered outpatient drug methodology set forthin section 202 of Public Law 100-360) and the charges for the home IV drugtherapy supplies and services, which are payable under the methodologyset forth in this proposed rule. For home IV drug therapy services, theintermediaary will calculate payment at the lower of the total billed chargesor the appropriate per diem fee schedule amount multiplied by the numberof days covered by the bill.We believe that this proposed basic fee schedule with allowances for specialcircumstances and costs would be equitable because it is based largelyon information collected from the industry, data reported in medical journals,and consideration of current payment levels for similar Medicare benefits(for example, home health care, hospice services, and durable medical equipment).We believe that the amounts we are proposing are fair and equitable forefficient and economically-operated providers. Consequently, we expectthat the proposed fee schedules would allow for adequate access to homeIV drug therapy for Medicare beneficiaries. However, we are specificallyseeking verifiable information on costs and practices that will be consideredin determining final rates.We recognize that, depending on their organizational structure, location,and patient mix, many entities that furnish home IV drug therapy may experiencecosts for individual services and supplies that are higher or lower thanthe amounts reflected in the fee schedules and additional allowances. However,the fee schedules should be viewed in terms of a comprehensive amount fora complete package of goods and services that all providers must be ableto furnish, either directly or under arrangement, rather than as separateallowances for discrete items. Therefore, public comments that addressthe individual allowances in the context of the fee schedule as a wholerather than as discrete components will be particularly useful.An itemization of the separate services and supplies contained in the proposedfee schedules, add-on allowances and the methodolgy we propose to use tocalculate payment follow.A. Pharmacy Services, Supplies, and DeliveryThe proposed per diem fee schedule allowances for pharmacy services arethe sum of the separate proposed per diem allowances for professional pharmacistservices, pharmacy supplies, and delivery of home IV drugs and relatedsupplies.From our consultations with entities that currently furnish home IV drugtherapy services, we learned that the intensity of pharmacy services isclosely linked to the dosage requirements of the patient. In addition,much of the literature on personnel and supply costs associated with IVdrugs and their administration focused on pharmacy time and motion studiesto determine the cost of the preparation of a single dose of IV medicationin a hospital. Therefore, we decided to construct the per diem fee schedulesfor pharmacy services on a cost per dose basis to the extent possible becausewe believe it best reflects the costs of recurring IV drug therapy servicesin the home setting. Further, to the extent possible, we wanted to avoidconsidering costs of any one-time or nonrecurring services that occur inpreparation for patient discharge from the hospital.We considered three principal data sources to obtain cost information concerningpharmacy services:andbullet; A survey conducted by the American Society for Hospital Pharmacistsof a sample of its members who are involved in the provision of home IVdrug therapy services (the ASHP survey).andbullet; A survey of hospital-based pharmacies published in 1988 by EliLilly and Company, a drug manufacturer, in which the surveyed pharmaciesindicated the average total time spent on pharmacy services per dose (theLilly survey).andbullet; A collection of published time and motion studies of pharmacyservices for inpatient hospital IV drug therapy (the time and motion studies).\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The time and motion studies include the following fourarticles:<ITAG tagnum="28">Tanner, David J., ``Cost Containment of Reconstituted Parenteral Antibiotics:Personnel and Supply Costs Associated with Preparation, Dispensing, andAdministration'', </ITAG><T3>Reviews of Infectious Diseases, </T3>Vol. 6, Supp. 4, November-December1984.<ITAG tagnum="28">Eisenberg, John M., Koffer, Harris, and Finkler, Steven A., ``EconomicAnalysis of a New Drug: Potential Savings in Hospital Operating Costs fromthe Use of a Once-Daily Regimen of a Parenteral Cephalosporin'', </ITAG><T3>Reviews of Infectious Diseases, </T3>Vol. 6, Supp. 4, November-December1984.<ITAG tagnum="28">Tanner, David J. and Nazarian, Marita Q., ``Cost Containment Associatedwith Decreased Parenteral Antibiotic Administration Fequencies'', </ITAG><T3>American Journal of Medicine, </T3>October 19, 1984.<ITAG tagnum="28">Veterans Administration Pharmacy Service Study Group, ``Variable CostPer Dose of Preparing and Administering Small-Volume Cephalosporin Admixtures'',</ITAG><T3>American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, </T3>Vol. 41, December 1984.None of the data sources was perfectly reflective of the pharmacy servicesthat would be furnished for patients living at home. However, after studyingand comparing these data sources, we decided to use the Lilly survey asthe data source for cost information on pharmacy services for the reasonsthat follow. A comparison of the findings of the three different data sources(the Lilly survey, the ASHP survey, and the time and motion studies) demonstratedthat the Lilly survey struck a balance between the wide differences intime and cost values found in the other two data sources. Some of the reasonsfor the differences between the ASHPA and time and motion studies werereadily apparent. For example, although the time and motion studies includedinformation about the amount of time required for a pharmacist to prepareand dispense a single dose, these studies did not include information concerningclinical services. The ASHP survey measured the amount of a pharmacist'stime required for clinical and distributive services on a per day basis,which reflects dosing requirements for patients on both single and multipledrug regimens. Since we had already decided to propose per diem fee schedulesfor pharmacy services based on per dose cost information, we were not ableto use the ASHP survey information because we were unable to convert theASHP per day cost information into cost information on a per dose basis.In addition, because the ASHP survey focused on hospital patients who wouldbe continuing IV drug therapy at home, this survey appears to include someservices that are traditionally performed prior to hospital discharge anddo not continue over the course of IV drug therapy provided in the home.Because the Lilly survey was not limited to patients who would continueto receive IV drug therapy after discharge from the hospital, the Lillysurvey included fewer nonrecurring pharmacy services that are furnishedjust prior to discharge than did the ASHP survey. Other differences betweenthe ASHP survey and the time and motion studies were not easily discernible.Thus, the Lilly survey was the only data source that converted both clinicaland distributive services into a single dose unit of measure based on timeand motion analyses. Consequently, we decided to use the Lilly survey forcost information concerning pharmacy service. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Professional Pharmacist Services </ITAG>The proposed per diem fee schedule allowance for pharmacy services is $9.18for antibiotic therapy and $1.22 for pain management therapy. We calculatedthe payment based on the 1988 Lilly survey (described above) in which thesurveyed pharmacies indicated that the average total time spent on pharmacistservices per dose (including all clinical and distributive functions) was7.0 minutes for small-volume parenterals (that is, IV drugs), excludinghyperalimentation and antineoplastic agents. The time value for clinicaland distributive services associated with large-volume parenterals was6.4 minutes. However, we were informed by entities that provide home IVdrug therapy that large volume parenterals represent a nominal share ofthe pharmacy workload for home IV drug therapy. Therefore, we used thetime value of 7 minutes as one of the factors to determine per dose costsfor all covered home IV drugs. We calculated a pharmacy service per dose cost of $3.67 for all drugs basedon the product of this time value (that is, 7 minutes) and a total pharmacycost of $31.49 per hour, which is based on an average adjusted hourly salaryrate for a pharmacist of $19.86 and for a pharmacy technician of $8.09plus employee benefits and overhead costs. Based on our discussion withhospital pharmacists and our review of literature, we concluded that theprevalent practice is to use pharmacy technicians to assist registeredpharmacists in the preparation of IV drug products. For purposes of thisproposed rule, we are estimating a blend of 75 percent pharmacist timeand 25 percent technician time in preparing each dose. We are specificallyseeking public comment on this issue. To calculate the adjusted hourly salary rate for a pharmacist, we useda basic hourly salary for a pharmacist of $18.42 found in the 1988 LillyHospital Pharmacy Survey of hospital pharmacist salaries paid in 1987.We adjusted that 1987 base salary to 1989 levels by increasing it by theinflation factors used to update the 1987 and 1988 Medicare Part B reasonablecharges for other nonphysician services subject to the inflation indexcharge limitation, that is, 3.7 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.These computations resulted in an adjusted salary rate of $19.86. For calculatingthe adjusted hourly salary rate for a pharmacy technician, we used a basichourly salary rate of $8.09. An hourly salary rate of $7.50 for pharmacytechnicians was found in the 1988 Lilly Hospital Pharmacy Survey. We adjustedthat 1987 base salary to 1989 levels in the same manner as we did for pharmacistsalaries, that is, by increasing the base salary by the inflation factorsused to update Medicare Part B reasonable charges for other nonphysicianservices subject to inflation-indexed charge limitation (3.7 percent for1988 and 4.0 percent for 1989). This yields an adjusted hourly salary rateof $8.09 for a pharmacy technician. Applying the blend of 75 percent pharmacisttime and 25 percent pharmacy technician time, our calculation yielded ablended hourly salary rate of $16.92, to which we applied a factor of 13.5percent to reflect employee benefits such as medical and life insurance,Social Security taxes, and retirement benefits. This is the factor currentlyused by the Federal government to describe the ratio of benefits to salariesfor Federal employees. The product of these two factors ($16.92 x 1.135)results in a total labor cost of $19.20 per hour.We were unable to obtain data on pharmacist overhead costs specific toentities that furnish home IV drug therapy services. Limited informationon overhead costs was available from a survey conducted for the State ofMaryland Medicaid program of 1985 operational data for pharmacies locatedin that State. (This survey (which is titled ``Survey of Pharmacy OperationalData in the State of Maryland'') was conducted by Myers and Stauffer, CPA,Topeka, Kansas and is dated November 15, 1985.) These data, based on informationreported by over 200 independent and chain pharmacies, showed that overheadcosts equal 54 percent of labor costs per prescription. We believe that home IV drug therapy providers have additional costs notborne by community pharmacies. The volatile nature of IV drug formulation(as discussed in detail in the proposed rule on the conditions of participationfor home IV drug therapy providers) may require the acquisition and maintenanceof specialized equipment or services, such as laminar airflow hoods andmedical waste disposal; the application of more stringent quality controlmeasures; and the provision of emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 daysper week. Additionally, we believe there is more likelihood of added costdue to product waste and complications resulting from home IV drugs thanfrom other more traditional forms of outpatient medication (for example,oral or topical drugs) normally provided by community pharmacies. For thesereasons, we have added a factor of 10 percent to take into account additionalpharmacist overhead costs for home IV drugs. Therefore, the total overheadfactor used is 64 percent. (We specifically invite public comment on theappropriate factor to be used for pharmacy services.) The product of thisoverhead factor and the hourly labor cost of $19.20 results in a totalpharmacist cost of $31.49 per hour or $3.67 per dose ($31.49 andmultiply;\7/60\). Due to the unavailability of relevant data, this proposed per diem feeschedule allowance would not include an adjustment for pharmacy labor costsbased on geographic area (that is, urban or rural or State-to-State variations)wage differences. We are particularly interested in receiving public commentconcerning the appropriate source and use of geographic wage indexes formaking such an adjustment to pharmacist labor costs. In terms of number of doses per day, we assume that patients on antibioticswould be receiving a drug intravenously an average of 2.5 times per day,for a total per diem cost of $9.18 ($3.67 per dose cost andmultiply; 2.5doses). This is consistent with the average number of doses per day ascalculated in a study conducted by a large company that furnishes homeIV drug therapy. We assume that pain management patients would either receivea drug intravenously on a continuous basis over a 72-hour period throughoutthe entire course of their therapy or use special pumps that contain 3full days' supply of the drug. As a result, pharmacist costs for analgesicswould be based on the preparation of one-third of a dose daily, for a totalper diem of $1.22. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Pharmacy Supplies </ITAG>We are proposing a per diem fee schedule allowance of $17.50 for pharmacysupplies for antibiotic therapy and $5.80 for pain management therapy.The cost information used in calculating this component of the fee schedulewas obtained from various sources including published studies, entitiesthat furnish home IV drug therapy, medical suppliers, and hospital pharmacies.The proposed per diem fee schedule allowance reflects an average basiccost of pharmacy suplies of $7.00 per dose, adjusted for the cost of suppliesnecessary for pumps and similar infusion devices.To determine the average basic cost of supplies per dose, we first consideredthe results of a 1982 hospital pharmacy study that was published in the``American Journal of Medicine \3\<NOTE/>.'' That study, which included data from several hospitalsof varying bed size, identified supplies associated with the preparation,dispensing, and administration of a single dose of IV antibiotic. The studydetermined that there was an average supply cost of $4.80 per dose, whichis based on 1982 manufacturers' list prices less a 40 percent discountrate that the article reported to be widely available to small hospitals(that is, those hospitals with fewer than 200 beds). We adjusted the 1982base amount of $4.80 to 1989 levels by increasing it by inflation factorsused to update the Medicare Part B reasonable charges for other nonphysicianservices subject to the inflation index charge limitation. For those yearsprior to implementation of the index inflation charge (that is, 1983 through1985) or for those years in which the inflation factor was not applied,the annual increase in the CPI-U, which is the basis of the inflation factor,was used. Those update factors are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Tanner, David J. and Nazarian, Marita Q., ``Cost ContainmentAssociated with Decreased Parenteral Antibiotic Administration Frequencies'',<T3>American Journal of Medicine</T3>, October 19, 1984.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,tp8,p7,7/8,i1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4</C><T4>Annual Update Factor</T4><H1>1983</H1><H1>1984</H1><H1>1985</H1><H1>1986</H1><H1>1987</H1><H1>1988</H1><H1>1989</H1> 7.1 <D>2.6 </D><D>4.2 </D><D>3.8 </D><D>1.8 </D><D>3.7 </D><D>4.0</D></ITAG>This calculation results in a 1989 cost of $6.69 for the supplies listedin the article. For comparative purposes, we also consulted the 1988 catalogprices of a major medical supplier. Our computation showed that a packageof similar supplies added up to $6.41 per single dose. Such a package includes:one syringe, one needle, sterile water, an IV administration set, a 100ml minibag of 5 percent dextrose solution, alcohol swabs, and a heparinflush kit.These estimates are supported by more recent cost information that hasbeen obtained from additional sources, including manufacturers of medicalsupplies, entities that furnish home IV drug therapy, and published data.For example, a study of home IV drug therapy delivery systems that waspublished in ``Hospitals \4\<NOTE/>'' indicated that the nondrug material and labor costs ofdelivering a single dose of an IV drug in a low-volume bag (50 ml to 100ml) in a hospital setting is $5.18. (We did not use that figure becausethe article as published did not provide sufficient details, such as hospitalsize and an itemization of supplies used.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Amen, Ronald and Smith, Christine Foltyn, ``Choose IVDelivery Systems Wisely'', <T3>Hospitals</T3>, September 20, 1988.Nonetheless, we recognize that there may be additional supply costs associatedwith home IV drug therapy that are not reflected in the Tanner and Nazarianstudy. Some of the factors that contribute to higher costs may be relatedto characteristics of the patient, the drug, or the home environment. Forexample, extra supplies such as IV extension tubing, saline flushes, andcentral line catheter clamps may be required due to safety considerations.In addition, since self-administering patients lack the proficient techniqueof skilled medical personnel, we expect there is heavier use of routineor miscellaneous IV supplies (such as needles and alcohol swabs) in thehome setting. As a result, we rounded the $6.69 amount generated by theTanner study to $7.00 per dose, which reflects an increase of approximatelyfive percent. We note that this amount represents an increase of nearly10 percent over the $6.41 per dose cost of similar supplies for which wefound prices listed in a major manufacturer's catalog.The basic $7.00 per dose estimate was adjusted for the costs associatedwith the supply kit required for ambulatory pumps necessary for deliveryof home IV drug therapy, as discussed in detail in section II.C. of thispreamble. We used a list price, which was published in ``Pharmacy PracticeNews \5\<NOTE/>,'' of $13.00 per administration set for pumps used for painmanagement patients to which we applied a 20 percent discount, which yieldeda price of $10.40. We factored in this discount because, as discussed insection III.3.C. below, we learned from pump manufacturers that many pumpsare regulary sold to home care agencies at a volume purchase price reflectinga markdown of 20 percent. To arrive at a per diem allowance, we assume,as indicated above, that an average of 2.5 doses per day would be preparedfor patients receiving antibiotics and one-third dose per day for patientsreceiving pain management therapy. This results in a per diem pharmacyallowance (of $17.50 for antibiotic therapy ($7.00 andmultiply; 2.5) and$5.80 for pain management (($7.00 + $10.40) andmultiply; .333).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Chart on pp. 29-33, <T3>Pharmacy Practive News</T3>, July 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Pharmacy Delivery</ITAG>The proposed per diem fee schedule allowance for pharmacy delivery of allhome IV drugs is $2.11 or, expressed in terms of trip costs, $10.56 pertrip. Based on interviews with entities that furnish home IV drug therapyand our review of the literature in this field, we learned that drug deliveriesgenerally are made once every 3 to 7 days depending on the shelf life ofthe drugs, which is often determined by the packaging method (for example,some mixtures are refrigerated and some mixtures are frozen). We proposeto use as a basis for the fee schedule the midpoint of that range; thatis, a 5-day delivery cycle for both antibiotics and analgesics.In order to compute a proposed fee schedule allowance, we first calculateda per trip cost. The per trip cost estimate assumes that patients wouldreside an average distance of 20 miles from the home IV drug therapy provider.There were little or no data available on which to estimate the distancebetween patients' residences and home IV drug therapy providers. Limiteddemographic information was shared by an entity based in a metropolitanarea that furnishes home IV drug therapy. It was the experience of thatparticular entity that its patients lived in either the same county inwhich the entity was located or in adjacent counties. As a result, we estimatedthat the average distance between patient and provider would be approximately20 miles; we specifically invite public comment on the validity of thisassumption.We would expect that deliveries would be scheduled so that each trip wouldcover the needs of at least two patients. Thus, the per patient mileagefor delivery would be 20 miles per round trip. We calculated an averageround trip of 20 miles per patient at $.225 per mile (the current Federalmileage allowance for the use of personal vehicles), which would resultin a total mileage cost of $4.50. We assume labor costs based on .5 hourdriving time (20 miles traveled per round trip per patient at 40 milesper hour) using the average salary rate of $8.09 per hour for a pharmacytechnician. The product of the average hourly rate of $8.09 and .5 hourdriving time yields a total of $4.04 for direct labor costs.As with pharmacy services, there were no data available on direct and overheadcosts specific to drug delivery services. Unlike pharmacy services, however,delivery services do not require facility space for storage of drugs andsupplies, quality control testing, and specialized equipment or services.Consequently, we concluded that the 64 percent overhead factor appliedto pharmacy services would be excessive for drug delivery services.After further consideration of the results produced by the survey of Marylandpharmacies (which indicated on overhead cost of 54 percent), as well asthe overhead factor used for nursing services (see discussion below), wedetermined that an overhead factor of 50 percent would be reasonable. Therefore,we are proposing the use of a 50 percent overhead factor for delivery servicesand specifically invite comment on the appropriate factor to be applied.Use of the 50 percent factor would yield a total delivery cost per patient(that is, labor and overhead costs) of $10.56 per trip. Thus, the per diemcost of delivery for all covered drugs (delivery once every 5 days) wouldbe $2.11.B. Nursing Services and SuppliesThe proposed fee schedule allowance for nursing services and supplies is$15.94 per diem or, expressed in terms of a nursing visit, $47.81 per visit.In determining the allowance for this component, we assumed that home visitswould occur on an average of once every 3 days. The proposed Medicare conditionsof participation for home IV drug therapy providers, which are the subjectof a separate notice of proposed rulemaking, require that peripheral injectionsites be rotated every 3 days to reduce the possibility of phlebitis. Thispolicy reflects current standard practice among entities that furnish homeIV drug therapy. While there is no absolute Medicare standard proposedfor the frequently of nursing visits for monitoring central line injectionsites, the results of our consultation with entities that furnish homeIV drug therapy indicate that, although different costs might arise atdifferent times, there are no material differences between the cost ofnursing care for central line and peripheral line patients over the courseof therapy. Therefore, we assumed a similar schedule of nursing visitsfor central line patients.Our proposed allowance for nursing costs includes payment for time spentin direct patient care, travel time to and from the patient's home, mileage,an allowance for supplies, and an overhead rate for indirect labor andother costs. Labor costs associated with direct patient care and travelwould be adjusted by the urban and rural wage indexes currently used incalculating the Medicare schedule of limits on home health agency (HHA)costs. (See 54 FR 27742; June 30, 1989.)We were unable to locate annual salary data specific to IV-certified nursesto use as the basis for labor cost estimates. Although two entities thatprovide home IV drug therapy services cited total compensation levels ofapproximately $45,000, those levels largely represented salary and benefitcosts for full-time nurses employed in supervisory or managerial positionsrather than the cadre of nurses providing direct patient care in the home.These entities did not disclose information on compensation agreementswith part-time nurses paid on a contractual or per visit basis. Other entitiesor health care organizations with whom we consulted cited nursing chargesranging from $30 to $90 per visit. In order to construct a nursing costmodel, therefore, we referred to a national survey of nursing salariesitemized by specialty, which was published in ``Modern Healthcare \6\<NOTE/>.'' However, because there was no specialty clearly fittingthe description of IV-certified nurse, we decided to use the home healthspecialty as the basis for the model.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Cole, Ben S., and Sizing, Walt, ``Cole Nurse Compensation'',<T3>Modern Healthcare, </T3>December 1988.For nursing services, we would use a 1988 annual wage of $27,700 for thehome health specialty nurse based on the results of the ``Modern Healthcare''survey, which we adjusted to 1989 levels by the same inflation factor weused for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians (that is, 4.0 percent) fora 1989 annual salary of $28,808. We then divided the inflation-adjustedsalary of $28,808 by total net work hours per year. (Although there appearsto be widespread use of part-time or ``contract'' nurses in home IV drugtherapy care, we were unable to determine, on average, the ratio of part-timeor contract to full-time nurses and its resulting effect on personnel compensationcosts. To develop net work hours for nursing services, therefore, we areusing an assumption of 6 weeks of combined vacation, sick leave, and timespent in training and other professional development, although the practiceof paid leave is more traditionally associated with full-time employment.)Our computation for productive work hours is as follows: 52 weeks andmultiply;40 hours per week ^ 2,080 total annual paid hours. A total of 2,080 paidhours minus 240 hours for time away from work (that is, 6 weeks andmultiply;40 hours per week) = 1,840 net work hours. The resulting hourly salaryrate for nursing care would be $15.66 (that is, $28,808 divided by 1,840= $15.66).In order to determine estimates for indirect or overhead costs associatedwith nursing care, we referred to the HHA input price index (or HHA marketbasket), which is used to generate the Medicare cost limits. The relativeweights used in the market basket show that costs not related to wagesand benefits (including such components as contract services, transportation,office costs, medical equipment and supplies, rent, utilities, and miscellaneousitems) account for approximately 25 percent of the current HHA cost limits.(See 54 FR 27742; June 30, 1989.)However, that ratio may be understated because HHA labor costs includegeneral and administrative wages and benefits, which we are treating asoverhead costs for purposes of determining the fee schedule allowances.In addition, we have reason to believe that home IV drug therapy servicesmay generate a higher proportion of indirect costs due to the provisionof emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and more stringentquality control requirements. We also note that, unlike home health services,which are paid on a per visit and, consequently, more open-ended basis,home IV drug therapy services are to be paid on a per diem basis (whichis based on a typical schedule of a nursing visit every 3 days). In otherwords, home IV drug therapy nursing services are essentially capped. Therefore,we used an indirect costs factor of 50 percent to ensure that the per diemfee schedule fully provides for crisis care and other complications arisingfrom the provision of home IV drug therapy, which involves the use of potentiallydangerous drugs. Accordingly, we increased the hourly salary by an overheadfactor of 50 percent to reflect indirect nursing-related costs, for anadjusted nursing services cost of $23.49 per hour.We then gathered information on average nursing time spent in the homeof an IV drug therapy patient from a number of sources including severalentities that furnish home IV drug therapy, a national home care association,a review of nursing notes submitted by a home health care agency for purposesof requesting an exception to the home health cost limits, a health maintenanceorganization, and a professional nurses association. After comparing theinformation received from these different sources, we determined that anursing visit averages approximately 30 minutes for assessing the patientand changing IV sites or dressings and 15 minutes for consultation anddocumentation. This would result in a total of 45 minutes of direct patientcare. We estimated time spent in travel status to be 40 minutes betweenpatients. Thus, the total period of time per nursing visit would be 85minutes, which at $23.49 per hour, converts to a total nursing visit costof $33.28, or $11.09 per day. We are assuming that the average mileageper patient is 20 miles with a travel time of 40 minutes. We assume thatthe average distance between the provider and the first patient to be visitedand also the average distance between patients is 20 miles. (We do notexpect the nurse to be making round trips to the provider's office betweenpatient visits. We believe that 40 minutes travel time per patient is reasonablefor both urban and rural areas.) We are specifically seeking comments anddata about whether 40 travel time is appropriate for urban and rural areas.Thus, mileage payment for 20 miles at $.225 per mile (Federal mileage allowance)is $4.50 per visit, which, divided by 3 results in a per diem allowanceof $1.50. An additional allowance associated with the nursing visit wouldbe included for the cost of supplies that are related to nursing servicesrather than to pharmacy services, for example, an IV start kit with catheter,sterile dressings, gloves, bandages, thermometers, and an air eliminationfilter. Thus, the per diem fee schedule allowance for nursing servicesand supplies would be calculated by the following formula:<ITAG tagnum="15">[(Patient care time andmultiply; adjusted nursing cost per hour) + (Traveltime andmultiply; adjusted nursing cost per hour) + Mileage allowance + Nursingsupplies] divided by 3 days=Per diem allowance for nursing services andsupplies; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>(.75andmultiply;$23.49)+(.667andmultiply;$23.49) +$4.50=$10.04</H1><H2>3</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>$15.95</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As discussed above, the labor portion of the $15.95 per diem fee scheduleallowance (that is, $11.09 or (($23.49 andmultiply; 1.417) divided by 3))would be adjusted by the HHA wage index.C. Other EquipmentWe are proposing a per diem fee schedule allowance of $.71 for other IVequpment for antibiotic therapy and $6.56 for pain management therapy.This allowance is for equipment that is not related to pharmacy or nursingservices and has not already been taken into account through the allowancesfor those services. Therefore, this allowance would cover the costs ofIV poles and two different types of electronic infusion devices (pumpsor controllers). Our proposed allowance is based on assumptions concerningequipment use and patient mix as well as cost estimates of equipment basedon manufacturers' list prices less an appropriate discount factor.Equipment needs generally vary according to the particular drug therapybeing furnished to a patient. There are two types of delivery systems usedmost frequently to administer IV drugs and other fluids to the patient:The gravity drip and the infusion pump. When the gravity drip is used,the equipment consists of an IV pole from which the administration setand IV bag are suspended.Generally, a gravity drip is used for antibiotic therapy. However, sincea gravity drip must be visually monitored to ensure it is working and occaionallyrestarted if it has stopped working, patient or caregiver physical limitations(for example, vision or dexterity problems) may necessitate the use ofa pump. In addition, a patient with poor venous access may also need touse a pump instead of the gravity drip. Therefore, in developing the feeschedule for antibiotics, we estimate that 90 percent of all Medicare patientsreceiving antibiotics could use the basic gravity system, which uses onlyan IV pole, and the other 10 percent would need to use a pump. However,these patients' needs can be met with a relatively simple pump.Patients receiving pain management therapy are treated with narcotic drugswhose use must be strictly controlled. A more specialized pump with a bolusfeature is customarily used for these patients because it can be programmedto control daily dosage while permitting the patient to rapidly infusepreprogrammed incremental amounts of the drug to alleviate pain.In discussions with pump manufacturers, we leared that many pumps are regularlysold to home care agencies at a volume price reflecting a markdown of 20percent. The fee schedule allowance, therefore, reflects that same markdownfactor for these devices.In order to determine the cost of the various pumps, list price data andamortization guidelines were obtained from ``Pharmacy Practice news,''\7\<NOTE/> a trade publication, and from several pump manufacturers.For purposes of developing the fee schedule, we have assumed that a pumphas a useful life of 1 year and, thus, we amortized the daily cost of apump over 1 year, that is, 365 days.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Pharmacy Practice News,</T3> pp. 29-33.The average rental cost of an IV pole is $10.00 per month or $.33 per day.The relatively simply pump or similar device that would be used by Medicarepatients receiving antibiotics is available at a net cost of $1,488 (listprice of $1,860 minus the 20 percent markdown) or $4.08 per day. The pumpwith bolus feature is available at an average net cost of $2,396 (listprice of $2,995) or $6.56 per day.We are proposing to use a weighted average for the use of IV poles anda simple infusion pump based on the assumed patient mix (discussed above).Therefore, the per diem fee schedule allowance for other equipment wouldbe calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="25">Antibiotic therapy: 90 percent of patients receiving antibiotics andmultiply;per diem cost for an IV drip pole + 10 percent of patients receiving antibioticsandmultiply; per diem cost for a simple infusion pump = Per diem allowanceof other equipment; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(90%andmultiply;$.33)+(10%andmultiply;$4.08)=$.71.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Pain Management therapy: 100 percent of patients receiving pain managementtherapy andmultiply; per diem cost of an ambulatory infusion pump = per diemallowance of other equipment; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(100% andmultiply; 6.56) = $6.56.</ITAG>D. Additional AllowancesAllowances for special costs to the home IV drug provider would be madein addition to the per diem fee schedule. The allowances would be paidin addition to the basic per diem fee schedule for the one-time costs forpatient education and counseling, for the additional costs to the providerof a patient who receives a multiple IV drug regimen, and for the costof a nursing visit associated with the first dose of any new drug addedto the drug regime of an established patient. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Patient Education and Counseling</ITAG>In the case of a patient who begins IV drug therapy as a hospital inpatient,we assume that thorough patient training in self-administration has beenprovided before hospital discharge. As a result, once the patient is dischargedto his or her home, we would provide a lump sum allowance equivalent tothe payment for two home nursing visits. The purpose of these visits isto insure that the home environment is satisfactory for IV drug therapy(for example, there must be a working refrigerator to keep the drugs andother fluids cooled before using), observe the first dose administeredby the patient at home, reinforce prior IV therapy administration training,familiarize the patient with any new equipment (quite possibly the IV equipmentis slightly different from that furnished in the hospital), and generallyaid the patient in making the transition from IV drug therapy in the hospitalto IV drug therapy in the home.We expect that a patient who starts IV drug thereapy in other than a inpatienthospital setting and who therefore has received no inpatient hospital trainingwould need additional training in self-administration of IV drug therapy.As a result, we would provide a lump sum allowance reflecting payment forthree nursing visits.To calculate the appropriate allowance for these services, we would usethe per diem allowance for nursing services, as discussed above in sectionIII.B. of this preamble. However, since all these visits do not involvethe use of nursing supplies, we have not included the cost of supplies(that is, $10.04) in this allowance. Therefore, the special adjustmentwould consist of the following one-time allowance (based on the cost ofa nursing visit of $37.77) for self-administration training for a patientwho began IV drug therapy:andbullet; For a patient who began IV drug therapy as a hospital inpatient,($37.77 andmultiply; 2) or $ 75. 54. andbullet; For a patient who began IV drug therapy other than as a hospitalinpatient, ($37.77 andmultiply; 3) or $113.31.As is our policy for nursing services, the labor portion of this allowancewould be adjusted by the HHA wage index.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Multiple IV Drug Regimen</ITAG>We would provide a special allowance for pharmacist services, pharmacysupplies, and nursing services in those cases in which a patient is receivingmore than one IV drug because we recognize that there are added personneland supply costs associated with a multiple drug regimen. We note thata multiple drug regimen exists only when two or more specific drug therapiesare prescribed. (For example, a patient is receiving two or more antibioticsor is receiving both antibiotics and analgesics.) Therefore, the followingallowance does not apply when a patient is receiving hydration as an adjunctto another drug. For example, if a patient administers saline flushes beforeor after infusion of an IV antibiotic, that is not considered a multipledrug regimen because the flushes are administered incidental to the prescribedantibiotic. Similarly, the allowance does not apply when additives (forexample, electrolytes) are introduced into the prescribed drug or diluent.We believe that, except for supplies and equipment that are dosage dependent,the additional costs associated with a multiple drug regimen are marginal.For example, although pharmacy dispensing services would increase markedly,that workload would not be necessarily doubled nor would there be a significantincrease in other distributive services. Similarly, additional pharmacisttime would be spent in some, but not all, clinical services. Finally, additionaldrug deliveries should not be required.For these reasons, we are setting the add-on allowance at 50 percent ofpharmacy services, 100 percent of pharmacy supplies, and 100 percent ofother equipment. This calculation results in an additional per diem allowanceof $22.80 for antibiotic therapy and $12.97 for pain management therapy.In those cases where a patient is receiving both antibiotic and pain managementtherapy, the antibiotic fee schedule is the fee schedule used as the basefor the calculation of the add-on allowance. In other words, the add-onallowance for a patient both on antibiotic and pain management therapyis $22.80.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Nursing Visit For Initial Dose Due to Change in Prescription</ITAG>We would also include a flat allowance of $18.89 (or 50 percent of theper visit allowance for nursing services less supplies) to cover the costof a nursing visit associated with the first dose of any new covered homeIV drug introduced into the drug regimen of an established patient. Forsafety reasons, many home IV drug therapy providers have established standardprocedures requiring the first dose to be administered either by a physicianor in a clinical setting.The proposed conditions of participation for home IV drug therapy providers,which are set forth in a separate rulemaking document published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 7, 1989 (54 FR 37220), similarlyrequre that either a physician or nurse be persent at the administrationof the initial dose. Physicians would directly bill Medicare Part B fortheir services. We believe that, on average, prescription changes wouldfrequently coincide with the regularly scheduled nursing visit. We have,therefore, included an allowance equal to 50 percent of the cost, lesssupplies, of a nursing visit to the home when the home IV drug therapyprovider sends a nurse to the home for the initial dose. This allowanceof $18.89 would be paid only when a prescription change calls for a newdrug to be added to the patient's drug regimen or for the substitutionof a new drug for one already being used. E. Updating the Fee ScheduleSection 1834(d)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish the feeschedule, prior to its implementation, for each calendar year after 1990.To meet this requirement, we intend to periodically review the rates, andwe will be considering ways the rates, once established, might be updated(that is, annually through the use of the percentage increase in the CPI-Uor on the basis of other data gathered through cost surveys and studiesor other sources).The proposed per diem fee schedule allowances and add-on allowances setforth in this proposed rule have been adjusted for inflation only through1989. The figure for 1990 will not be available until September of thisyear. Therefore, we intend to further adjust the allowances set forth inthis document by the 1990 inflation factor as part of the final rule.We recognize that, because this is a relatively new health care service,experience with home IV drug therapy is still growing. The introductionof new drugs and technology, improved safety practices, and greater awarenessof the availability of such services are but some of the factors that couldcreate changes and influence new trends in the delivery of home IV drugtherapy. We expect that, as both Medicare and private sector experiencegrows, so will the availability of data. As a result, if in the futurethere is strong evidence of material change in the composition or costsof home IV drug therapy services, we would propose to modify the fee scheduleto more accurately reflect those services or costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Alternatives Considered</ITAG>Instead of a separate per diem fee schedule for each of the two major drugtherapies with additional allowances for special and one-time costs, weconsidered several alternatives that were subsequently rejected as discussedbelow.A. Separate Fee Schedules Covering Different IV LinesWe considered establishing separate fee schedules with each one tailoredto the type of venous access. We asked an association that represents entitiesthat furnish home IV drug therapy for an assessment of the differencesin the cost of services and supplies associated with patients who havethe two different types of venous access: peripheral or central line.After polling a cross section of their membership (that is, proprietaryand not for profit entities, both urban and rural), the association reportedresults indicating that there was no significant difference overall. Anecdotalevidence furnished to the association suggested that, although differentcosts might arise at different points in time, there was no real disparityin costs over the full course of therapy. As a result, we rejected thisalternative.B. Single Per Diem Fee ScheduleWe considered establishing a single fee schedule that would take into accountestimated unit costs for labor and nonlabor resources, adjust those costsfor the unique characteristics of individual drug therapies, and weighthe resulting per diem costs by the estimated patient mix, that is, thepercentage of patients on a particular therapy.However, in constructing the unit costs for each of the therapies, it becameapparent that total costs for antibiotic therapy and pain management therapyare significantly different. As a result, the single fee schedule wouldhave been especially sensitive to our assumptions for patient mix and wouldhave increased the potential for adverse impact on a home IV provider whosecase mix was not reflective of those assumptions. Therefore, we rejectedthis alternative.C. Per Diem Fee Schedules that Incorporates Nonrecurring Costs and MultipleDrug RegimenWe considered incorporating the costs associated with nonrecurring servicesand multiple drug regimens in a per diem fee schedule, which wuld haveeliminated the need for added allowances for special costs. However, inthe case of nonrecurring costs, such a plan would have required developingestimates of the average length of therapy in order to arrive at a perdiem allowance. Moreover, by spreading the cost over the duration of anaverage therapy, a per diem allowance for nonrecurring services would adverselyaffect providers in those cases where patients are placed in home IV therapyfor relatively short periods of time.In order to build the costs of multiple drug regimens into a per diem feeschedule, we would have had to develop assumptions regarding the universeof patients, who are receiving a given number of IV drugs. However, wefound that there were insufficient data available on which to develop suchassumptions. Therefore, we rejected this alternative.D. Fee Schedule Based on Customary Home IV Drug Therapy Provider ChargesWe considered establishing a fee schedule based on current charging practicesof the entities that furnish home IV drug therapy. We rejected this alternativefor two major reasons.First, there were insufficient data to develop charge-based allowancesfor home IV drug therapy services. Our surveys of entities that furnishhome IV drug therapy indicated that these entities customarily charge aglobal fee; that is, one amount for the total charges for drugs, supplies,and services. Although we asked several entities to separate the cost ofthe drugs from their total charges so that we could attempt to make thecharges for services and supplies more analogous to the fee schedule methodologystatutorily required for the Medicare program, only one of these entitiesthat furnish home IV drug therapy was able or willing to provide this information.Second, we believe that a charge-based fee schedule would result in excessivepayment. For example, although there are substantial mark-downs in theprices for supplies and equipment widely available to home care agencieswho purchase in large volumes, we received no indication from the entitiesthat we contacted that they pass those decreased costs on to their patients.Instead we believe that the usual practice is for these entities to chargetheir patients the retail prices for supplies and equipment rather thanthe prices that the entities actually pay.Moreover, it appears that customary charges for home IV drug therapy reflecta number of costs incurred while the patient is in the hospital, such aspatient training and insurance verification. We believe these costs areincurred prior to hospital discharge and should not be shifted onto thecharges for IV drug therapy services furnished in the home setting.Finally, we have influenced in our decisions by the intent of Congressconcerning excessive payment levels. In enacting Public Law 100-360, Congressspecified in the Conference Report that ``* * * Medicare payment wouldbe the lower of the provider's actual charge or the fee schedule amount* * * [The Senate report had only required a fee schedule; the confereeslater added the `lower of' requirement.]'' (H.R. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong.,2nd Sess. 202 (1988).)We also heeded Congress's intent as expressed in the conference reportthat we consider costs, charges, and payment rates for similar Medicarecovered services. For example, the proposed fee schedule allowance forpatient equipment are consistent with Medicare carrier allowances for IVpoles and electronic infusion devices. The allowance for electronic devicesreflects the 20 percent volume purchase discount traditionally offeredto home care agencies by several pump manufacturers.In determining the proposed per diem allowance for the nursing component,we first considered using the per visit cost limits for home health agenciesas the model for home IV drug therapy providers. However, the home IV drugtherapy providers with whom we met or consulted strongly expressed theview that the technically sophisticated services involved in home IV drugtherapy are considerably different from traditional home health care services.To be as equitable as possible, therefore, we constructed an allowancefor nursing services based on information garnered from entities that furnishhome IV drug therapy, members of professional nursing associations, anda review of the literature on IV drug therapy. In our search for informationfrom outside sources, we asked what a home IV nursing visit would typicallyrequire in terms of nursing tasks, time, and supplies. Other questionsfocused on nursing personnel, such as professional qualifications and salaryor contractual payment levels. For pharmacy services and supplies, there are no existing Medicare allowances.As a result, the discrete proposed allowances for pharmacy services, supplies,and delivery services were constructed from information collected fromindependent surveys conducted by pharmacy-related groups, published articleson pharmacy cost analyses and time and motion studies, inquiries to medicalsupply manufacturers, and interviews with entities that provide home IVdrug therapy services.Nonetheless, Congress expressed special caution on exclusive use of customarycharges.<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * In establishing the fee schedule, the Secretary could considercost information, charge information, and payment rates for similar itemsand services covered under Medicare * * * The conference agreement providesthe Secretary with broad flexibility in establishing the fee schedule.The conferees expect that the Secretary will use this flexibility to establisha fee schedule which assures adequate access to services while preventingexcessive payments. The conferees note that exclusive reliance on customarycharges has previously resulted in excessive reimbursement levels for similarservices * * * (H.R. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess. 202 (1988)).</ITAG>For these reasons, we decided against basing the fee schedule on currentcharging practices of home IV drug therapy providers.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Changes to the Regulations</ITAG>The regulations implementing the provisions of sections 1834(d) (1) and(2) of the Act that provide for payment for home IV drug therapy servicesunder the castastrophic drug benefit provisions would be located in subpartJ (Payment for Home IV Drug Therapy Services) of a new part 414 (Paymentfor part B Medical and Other Health Services). We intend to issue a separatefinal rule to move the current sections on reasonable charges for partB services from part 405, subpart E to part 414. Other subparts will beadded in separate documents as new provisions of the law are implementedthrough the usual rulemaking process.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. IntroductionExecutive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, any rule that would be likelyto result in_andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis thatis consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.For purposes of the RFA, all home IV providers are considered to be smallentities.Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a proposed rule may have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysismust conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposesof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospitalwith fewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.We are not preparing a rural hospital impact statement because we havedetermined, and the Secretary certifies that this proposed rule would nothave a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial numberof small rural hospitals.The following discussion in combination with the discussion presented inthe preamble constitutes a complete regulatory and flexibility analysis.B. ObjectivesOur explicit objective in establishing the fee schedules contained in thisproposed rule is to provide adequate compensation to cover the averagemarginal costs (that is, the average cost of furnishing home IV drug therapyto one individual) of_andbullet; Pharmacy services that include both clinical and distributivefunctions and supplies and equipment necessary for safe and effective IVtherapy furnished in the patient's home;andbullet; Nursing services required for setting up the IV lines and changingsites at prescribed intervals;andbullet; Responding to emergencies;andbullet; Monitoring the patient's progress and maintaining required patientrecords; andandbullet; General administrative overhead.A second objective we wish to promote through the proposed fee schedulesis the efficient delivery of health services while, at the same time, ensuringthat patients' safety and welfare are not compromised. On the one hand,by setting our payments for home IV drug therapy services at a level thatapproximates an efficient provider's costs, we hope to discourage wastefulspending on such items as office space or personnel when the need for theseitems or staffs cannot be justified economically. On the other hand, weare concerned that providers receive adequate compensation to cover theiraverage marginal costs of providing high quality and effective care.A third objective we hope to achieve is to maintain the structure and dynamicsof the existing home IV drug therapy market. By designing the proposedfee schedules to meet the average marginal costs of established providers,we hope to maintain a position of neutrality with respect to the market.That is, we do not want to erect barriers to market entry, but neitherdo we want to create incentives for new providers to enter the market onthe basis of the proposed fee schedules.C. Affected Entities<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Home IV Providers</ITAG>According to the Prudential-Bache study of the home infusion industry citedearlier in this document, there are about 80 to 100 different companiesproviding home IV drug therapy care in some 300 to 350 local markets.\7\<NOTE/> Based on inquiries to HCFA and anectodal evidence, we anticipatethat approximately 6,000 entities that currently furnish home IV drug therapywill request approval as Medicare home IV providers. While this appearsto be a large number of providers, it may reflect the number of providersthat have expressed some interest in becoming home IV drug therapy providersrather than the number of providers that will actually qualify or thatwill furnish services to Medicare patients. Nevertheless, inauguratingcoverage of home IV drug therapy services for Medicare patients in 1990should not materially affect the home IV drug therapy market because thefee schedules we are proposing are designed to cover only the marginalcost of patient care. This amount, we expect, would not be enough to coverstart-up costs of a new provider. Thus, we do not foresee a rush of newentrants into the home IV drug therapy market for the exclusive purposeof serving Medicare patients.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Prudential-Bache,</T3> p. 24.We believe that decisions to enter the home IV drug therapy market or totreat Medicare patients will depend on the available capacity, patientreferral patterns, contractual arrangements with hospitals, overall penetrationinto the home infusion market and a provider's marginal productivity. Ofthese factors, a provider's capacity to meet the demand for home IV drugtherapy services from non-Medicare patients and its arrangements with areferring hospital may be the most important elements in the decision totreat a Medicare patient who meets the patient selection criteria. In marketswhere demand exceeds the supply of home IV providers, Medicare patientsmay have difficulty gaining access to home IV drug therapy services, whilein markets where surplus capacity exists, home IV drug therapy providersmay aggressively solicit Medicare patients.The other factor that may weigh heavily in a home IV drug therapy provider'sdecision to accept Medicare patients is the overall referral pattern fromhospitals in the provider's market. The Medicare hospital prospective paymentsystem has generated substantial incentives for hospitals to dischargeMedicare patients as early as possible. With coverage of home IV drug therapyservices beginning January 1990, hospitals will be eager to discharge patientsthat meet the patient selection criteria for home IV drug therapy. As discussedabove, market conditions and the amount of excess capacity home IV drugtherapy providers have will probably determine how likely they will beto accept Medicare patients. In markets where the excess home IV drug therapyservice capacity is low, hospitals are likely to employ a variety of strategiesto induce home IV drug therapy providers to accept Medicare patients. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Hospitals</ITAG>Coverage of home IV drug therapy services and the establishment of theproposed fee schedules may affect hosptials in two ways. The first way,as suggested above, is to permit hospitals to discharge patients requiringcontinuing IV drug therapy to their homes rather than keeping them in thehospital. This will relieve some of the financial pressures on hospitals.In most markets, we believe that home IV drug therapy providers have sufficientcapacity now to make placement of Medicare patients with a home IV drugtherapy provider easy. However, in some markets, and possibly in the future,high demand for placement of patients with home IV drug therapy providersmay make placement of Medicare patients more difficult. In markets of highdemand and low excess capacity, as mentioned above, hospitals may offerhome IV drug therapy providers financial incentives to gain access fortheir discharged patients requiring IV drug therapy. If hospitals adoptsuch strategies in order to reduce lengths of stay, their savings wouldbe reduced. Hospitals would have to carefully weigh the benefits of earlydischarges to a home IV drug therapy provider against the cost of offeringthe provider inducements to accepting their patients. The second major consequence the proposed fee schedules may have for somehosptials is to stimulate their entry into the home IV drug therapy market.Of all the types of provider that may enter the home IV drug therapy market,hospitals have resources available to them that may give them advantagesover other types of providers. Generally, hosptials have pharmacy facilitiesthat would meet the pharmacy requirements for home IV drug therapy providercertification; and, because of the volume of IV drugs utilized in the inpatientand outpatient settings, hospitals may be able to purchase IV drugs forhome use at lower prices than many freestanding home IV drug therapy providers.Hospitals also employ nurses qualified to start IVs and to handle emergenciesassociated with IV drug therapy. Depending on the number of IV trainednurses on staff, arrangements could be made to rotate nurses to the homeIV drug therapy provider without increasing labor costs. Another advantage hospitals may have over other providers is the potentialto control patient supply and demand. By vertically integrating the homeIV drug therapy provider with the hospital, the hospital may be able toeconomize on its marketing costs and administrative costs. Furthermore,with some assurance of a minimum number of referrals from the parent hospital,the hospital-based home IV drug therapy provider could seek referrals fromoutside sources during periods of low damand and dedicate more resourcesto the parent hospitals during periods of high demand. From the attending physician's standpoint, an integrated hospital-basedhome IV drug therapy provider may offer the physician certain materialand psychological benefits not available in patient care were transferredto an entirely separate provider after discharge. Since physicians, asa matter of routine, may visit the hospital several times a week, theymay have frequent opportunities to review patients' records and have personalcontact with the nursing staff responsible for the patients' care. Theopportunity to maintain on-going contact with the personnel caring fortheir patients following discharge may offer physicians a sense of controlthey may lack if they have only occasional contact with staff at a freestandinghome IV drug therapy provider. Although we believe that some hospitals may be in a better position toenter the home IV drug therapy market than other types of providers insimilar markets, we would not expect a hospital to enter the home IV drugtherapy market solely on the basis of the new Medicare benefit. We believeit would make sense for a hospital to enter the market only if it believesthat it could capture a sufficient portion of the non-Medicare businessto warrant entry into the market. The probability of market entry wouldincrease if the hospital had experience in the postdischarge segement ofthe market, for example through operating a hospital-based HHA.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. HHAs and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Suppliers</ITAG>As in the case of hospitals, it seems highly unlikely that Medicare coverageof home IV drug therapy services and the establishment of the proposedhome IV drug therapy fee schedules by themselves would result in any significantchanges in home IV drug therapy market structure for HHAs and DME suppliers.The decision to enter the home IV drug therapy market will largely dependon each organization's assessment of its ability to reach an adequate shareof the non-Medicare market. At most, we see the introduction of the Medicarehome IV drug therapy benefit and fee schedules as tipping the balance inone direction or another in an organization's decision to enter the homeIV drug therapy market.Generally, HHAs and DME suppliers may already furnish some but not allof the services Medicare would require a certified home IV drug therapyprovider to furnish. For example, an HHA may employ or contract with registerednurses trained to administer IV medication but not with pharmacists. ADME supplier may regularly furnish infusion pumps and other equipment necessaryfor home IV drug therapy but not employ or contract with either registerednurses qualified to administer IV drugs or pharmacists. In either case,the decision to enter the home IV drug therapy market will depend largely,we believe, on the organization's ability to acquire, either directly orunder arrangement, the services it does not now furnish. Also, we believe,the decision to acquire these services will be considered primarily interms of the non-Medicare market and only secondarily in terms of the Medicaremarket.D. Program CostsWe estimate that in 1990, approximately 65,000 Medicare beneficiaries willmeet the patient selection criteria for home IV drug therapy. Of these,we estimate that 87 percent will be continuing IV drug therapy begun inthe hospital. Further, we anticipate that about 60 percent of the patientswill be receiving medication for the management of pain and the remainingpatients will be receiving antibiotics. Using data from Table 2 of thePrudential-Bache study \8\<NOTE/> as a starting point and adjusting for differences betweenthe Medicare population and the population sampled in the study, we expectthat patients will undergo pain management therapy for an average of 60days. Patients receiving antibiotic therapy are expected to require anaverage of 30 days of home IV therapy. We anticipate that in calendar year1990 about 2.3 million patient days would be for patients receiving painmanagement therapy and 780,000 patient days would be for patients receivingantibiotic therapy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Prudential-Bache, p. 19.</T3>In addition to these assumptions about the Medicare home IV patient population,we estimate that about 25 percent of the patients receiving pain therapyin conjunction with chemotherapy (which, would not be covered as a homeIV drug therapy benefit) will repeat their treatment within 1 year of receivingthe initial home IV drug therapy. Also, we estimate that about 25 percentof Medicare home IV drug therapy patients will require multiple drug therapyand about 10 percent of Medicare home IV drug therapy patients will needan additional nursing visit as a result of a change in the patient's prescription.Based on the foregoing assessment of the Medicare home IV drug therapypopulation, we project that Medicare program payments for home IV services,as we proposed them in the document, would result in the following costsover the next 5 fiscal years, beginning January 1, 1990:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,4,4,4,4,4</C><T4>Medicare Program Payments for Home IV Drug Therapy Services Based onthe Proposed Fee Schedules</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions]*</ITAG><H1>FY 1990 </H1><H1>FY 1991 </H1><H1>FY 1992 </H1><H1>FY 1993 </H1><H1>FY 1994</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">$80 <D>$140 </D><D>$160 </D><D>$190 </D><D>$220</D><F>*Rounded to the nearest $10 million.</F></ITAG></ITAG>E. ConclusionThe proposed fee schedules, we believe, would offer home IV drug therapyproviders sufficient compensation to cover the marginal costs of treatingMedicare patients. However, the introduction of home IV drug therapy forMedicare patients and these proposed fee schedules should have little effecton the current structure of the market.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Other Required Information</ITAG>A. Paperwork BurdenThis proposed rule would not impose information collection requirements.Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budgetunder the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501through 3511).B.
