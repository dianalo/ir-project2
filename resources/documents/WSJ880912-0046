The symphony musicians voted 63-48 to decertify Local 76 of the union as their bargaining unit. The opera orchestra, which includes many of the same musicians, voted 51-39 for decertification, while ballet musicians voted 45-45. The ballet players will be asked by the National Labor Relations Board to vote again to try to break the tie.    The musicians have complained that they pay most of the union local's dues but that the 1,328-member local doesn't really bargain for them. They plan to replace the local with a new union, the International Guild of Symphony, Opera and Ballet Musicians, which has members in 12 cities, according to Randolph Baunton, the symphony's percussionist and the new union's founder.    Musician unrest with American Federation of Musicians locals exists in varying degrees in other cities, including San Francisco, Houston, Los Angeles, Reno, Nev., and Orlando, Fla., the new union's officials said.    The majority who voted to decertify are &quot;mainly angry and frustrated&quot; with the local and not with the American Federation of Musicians itself, said J. Martin Emerson, the union's president in New York. Their new union is a &quot;renegade,&quot; he said, and they will suffer from the lack of &quot;strength through unity&quot; but will be welcomed back to the federation &quot;with open arms when they get around to realizing the enormity of the error they have just made.&quot;    Officials of the Seattle local of the American Federation of Musicians couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
