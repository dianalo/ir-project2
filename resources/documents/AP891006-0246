Striking machinists, the biggest group of production workers atthe world's largest aerospace company, continued to press theirclaim for a larger share of the company's profits on the picketlines.   ``I would just like to see things a little more fair,'' FredMayo, a mechanic at Boeing's Everett plant, said Thursday night onthe picket line. ``The company did have a record year last year.''   Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet builder with 65percent of the free world's market, is in its fifth consecutiveyear of record jetliner orders with a backlog worth $80 billion.   The strike went into its third day today with no newnegotiations scheduled.   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said company officials metWednesday to discuss the strike but he knew of no further meetingsThursday.   ``The company is mute,'' said union spokesman Jack Daniels.``They're doing their aristocratic aloof act.''   The machinists' union is seeking a larger share of Boeing'sprosperity and fewer hours of mandatory overtime. Union members'current wages range from $8.88 to $18.42 an hour. Wage rateshaven't been increased for six years, although Boeing has paidbonuses.   The union rejected an offer of an immediate raise of 4 percentwith 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent thenext, plus a reduction in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarterfrom 200 hours.   ``I have a family, and on the average, I work 12-hour days,usually six or seven days a week,'' Mayo said. ``I don't want towake up one day and discover that I've missed seeing my 2-year-oldson grow up.''   Chairman Frank Shrontz sent Cheney a telegram Thursdayapologizing for any delays in delivery because of the strike andassuring that Boeing ``will do all it can to resolve this issue atthe earliest possible time.''   Boeing receives billions of dollars of defense contracts a yearthat range from work on the B-2 stealth bomber to guided missilesystems and avionic research.   ``We hope the strike will be short-lived,'' the telegram said.   Company spokesman Jack Gamble said about 40 planes were in thefinal assembly or test stages at Everett and Renton that probablycould be completed during the strike. Before the strike, Boeing wasproducing about 30 planes a month.   ``We've been working on a couple of airplanes, and that's it sofar,'' Gamble said. ``The first couple of days are spent figuringout who you've got available in what discipline.''   Many of the replacement workers do not have the airframe andpower plant licenses required for many assembly tasks, he said.   Members of other Boeing unions, which have no-strike clauses intheir contracts, have been reporting to work. Worldwide, Boeingemploys 164,000 people, including 106,000 in western Washington.   Bret Bertolin, a specialist with the state office of theforecast council, said the state agency estimated a monthlongstrike would mean $160 million in lost payroll, and $15 million inlost state revenues.   If it drags on, other industries would be affected and thepayroll loss would rise to $240 million in a second month, $320million in a third and $400 million in a fourth, he estimated.   Industry analysts said the strike's outcome could set a trendfor contracts at other aerospace companies.   Talks have been extended after a machinists' contract expiredSunday at Lockheed Corp. in Marietta, Ga., and the union's contractwith McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's only U.S. competitor forjetliners, is up Oct. 22.</TEXT></DOC>
