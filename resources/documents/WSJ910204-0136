They say themoney statistics may provide valuable clues to where theeconomy, Fed policy and interest rates are heading.</LP><TEXT>   At a House Budget Committee hearing Jan. 22, Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan said money supply &quot;in this particularenvironment will give us reasonably good signals relevant tohow the economy is emerging.&quot; He added, &quot;This is somethingwhich I would not have said two years ago.&quot;   Less than a decade ago, money-supply analysis was one ofWall Street's biggest growth industries. &quot;Once, there was aperiod when the sun rose and set on the weekly money-supplystatistics,&quot; recalls Robert A. Brusca, senior vice presidentat Nikko Securities Co. International. &quot;Then we had anotherphase where nobody cared.&quot; But now, he says, &quot;it's importantonce again. Thanks to Chairman Greenspan, the monetaryzombies have been brought back from the dead.&quot;   Watching the money supply is highly important not onlybecause of its influence on interest rates but also becausemoney and credit represent the basic fuel for economicgrowth. The Fed, created by Congress in 1913, tries to makesure there is enough money and credit to meet the economy'slong-run needs while also keeping inflation under control.Congress decided a central bank was needed after financialpanics shook the country in the late 1800s and again in 1907.   If money and credit grow too slowly, that can choke theeconomy and lead to a recession, or even a depression. But ifthe money supply expands too rapidly, it can lead toinflation and higher interest rates, which in turn hurtbusinesses and consumers and can also lead to a recession.   Mr. Greenspan and many other analysts are focusing onmoney more closely these days both because of the abruptslowdown of various money measures in recent months andbecause of pervasive reports of a credit crunch, orcredit-tightening, at commercial banks. For example, onemoney-supply gauge, M2, has shown little or no growth duringthe past several months. Concern about M2 continues eventhough the measure rose sharply in the week ended Jan. 21.   The Fed has been reducing short-term interest rates in anattempt to stimulate the sagging economy and acceleratemoney-supply growth. Therefore, money-supply figures in themonths ahead may provide one important clue to monetarypolicy and the direction of interest rates.   There are several ways to measure the nation's moneysupply. The narrowest yardstick, known as M1, consists ofsuch items as checking account deposits, traveler's checks,and currency held by the public. It used to be by far themost closely watched money number. Analysts argued that itwas an important economic indicator because it representedmoney readily available for spending.   When M1's growth rate shot above the Fed's target range,traders often assumed the Fed would react by raisingshort-term interest rates -- and vice versa. The weeklynumbers often jolted not only the bond markets but also thestock, commodity and foreign-exchange markets.   The Fed no longer has a target for M1 growth. It does,however, have &quot;monetary objectives&quot; for several broadermeasures, known as M2 and M3, as well as for growth in debt.   Mr. Greenspan recently singled out the M2 measure as themost meaningful right now, and thus that measure is drawingthe closest attention. The M2 gauge includes everything in M1plus certain types of savings, such as money-market depositaccounts and most money-market mutual fund accounts.   Mr. Greenspan and some private economists are worriedabout M2 because its growth rate has been so anemic, whichcould spell trouble for the economy. The Fed's 1990 targetfor M2 was 3% to 7% growth, as measured from the average in1989's fourth quarter. M2's growth for the year was 3.7%. Butin recent months, M2 growth has slowed to a trickle.   The Fed's preliminary, or &quot;provisional,&quot; 1991 target isfor 2.5% to 6.5% growth in M2. That target was set at ameeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in July. Thisand other targets will be reviewed at a meeting of the group,the Federal Open Market Committee, tomorrow and Wednesday.Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to disclose the final targetslater this month in his semiannual report to Congress knownas the Humphrey-Hawkins Report.   Even if the Fed does lower rates further soon, as mostforecasters expect, the economy and the money supply may beslow to respond. Fears about the war and recession have mademany companies and individuals reluctant to borrow. The woesof the banking and financial system also have made mattersworse.   Some analysts argue that &quot;velocity,&quot; or turnover, of moneyhas slowed, and that this will compound the Fed's job oftrying to jump-start the economy. They also warn of long andvariable lags in the impact of money-supply changes on theeconomy.   But some economists say the Fed already has done most ofwhat it needs to do to revive the economy. They argue thatthe Fed's previous credit-easing moves soon will spark fasterM2 growth, that the recession will be short and mild, andthat the Fed won't cut rates much more.   Here are several suggestions for individual investors onwhat to watch:   -- Don't focus on week-to-week money-supply changes. Theseweekly numbers are highly volatile and loaded withstatistical noise.   -- Do focus on longer-term trends. Look, for example, atwhere the various money-supply measures stand in relation tothe Federal Reserve's targets. When money supply fallspersistently below target, it could mean the economy isheading for a severe slump that could hurt stocks. But it canbe good news for holders of Treasury bonds, because it canmean lower inflation, or possibly even deflation. It also canbe a strong signal that the Fed soon will cut short-terminterest rates, which would lead to declines in rates on bankcertificates of deposit and money-market funds.   -- Keep an eye on &quot;bank reserves,&quot; which are contained inthe weekly Federal Reserve money-supply report. Reserves arethe raw material for the money supply. As with the moneysupply, though, don't focus closely on weekly changes. Look,instead, at monthly and quarterly changes. The Fed nowappears to be trying to rev up reserve growth in the hopethat this will stimulate more lending and investing.   -- Look mainly at M2. That's what Fed officials now appearto be watching. Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winningeconomist and longtime money-supply watcher, also now ismainly watching M2.   Regardless of how people feel about the reliability of themoney numbers, the weekly report is likely to remainimportant as long as Mr. Greenspan keeps talking about it.   &quot;The Chairman has said these numbers now are morereliable, so we all definitely must pay attention to them,&quot;says Mr. Brusca of Nikko Securities. &quot;You ignore thesenumbers at your own peril.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
