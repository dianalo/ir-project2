David Obey, D-Wis.,of the sides that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has beenseeking to unite behind a new policy for the past several weeks.   Baker and President Bush were expected to meet on the agreementFriday morning, then announce the new policy in an appearance withcongressional leaders.   The statement expresses support for Central American peaceefforts and democratic goals, calls for the ultimate reintegrationof the Contras into Nicaraguan political life and calls for an endto regional hostilities.   While it mentioned no specific figure for continued aid to therebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $4 million amonth, putting the aid package at roughly $40 million.   Thursday on Capitol Hill, Baker met first with House Democrats,then with House Republicans, then with Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan. The Senate was in recess, and Dole was seeking to reachkey senators out of town to secure final agreement.   Congressional leaders canceled other plans for Friday to be ableto appear at the White House.   Meanwhile, however, Contra supporters said they were concernedabout an audit report detailing alleged killing, rape and torture ofprisoners captured by the Contras, and they called for changes inthe rebels' political directorate to ensure such abuses do not recur.   The credibility of Contra leaders is at stake, said one lawmakerwho supports the rebels, speaking on condition of anonymity.``They've got a lot of housecleaning they have to do.''   Congressional sources, also speaking on condition they not benamed, said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that Contradirector Enrique Bermudez, also the Contra military commander, hadsought to cover up abuses or at least to prevent auditors fromfinding out about them.   The audit performed for the Agency for International Development,which administers the aid currently flowing to the rebels in theirHonduran camps along the border with Nicaragua, turned up theallegations during interviews late last year with 32 prisoners heldat Contra stockades.   The agreement on the policy statement by a majority ofcongressional Democrats and Republicans represented a sharp breakwith the recent history of U.S. policy in Central America in generaland Nicaragua in particular. It was the most consistentlycontentious foreign-policy subject during President Reagan's twoterms in office.   The compromise policy statement would extend non-military aid tothe anti-Sandinista rebels through Feb. 28, 1990, after Nicaragua'sscheduled national elections. The idea is to keep the rebels inplace along the Nicaraguan border until they feel able to safelyreturn to their homeland or decide to voluntarily disband.   The current $27 million aid package expires March 31.   ``I do think the administration is legitimate on this,'' saidObey, a severe skeptic of Reagan administration policy toward theregion.   A key to the progress was insertion of a provision Obey proposedthat will allow any one of four congressional committees dealingwith foreign affairs to put an end to the aid at the end ofNovember, should lawmakers decide the Bush administration was notadequately supporting regional peace efforts.   Another provision stipulates that aid will end automaticallyshould the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-borderincursions, or evidence further human rights violations. The packagealso says the aid money can be used for ``regional relocation'' ofthe rebels.   Obey said, ``Our expectation is that this will be in full supportof the Central American presidents'' who have been seeking to forgea regional peace settlement, most recently at a February meeting inEl Salvador. Their agreement there called for establishing a plan bymid-May to disband the 11,000-man Contra force and for the rebels tobe reintegrated into Nicaragua as political freedoms arere-established.   Much of the two-page U.S. policy statement, which had beenstamped ``Secret'' and kept under close wraps by Baker, consists ofbroad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goalsfor the region. Missing from the document are the kinds of harshdenunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized Reaganadministration rhetoric.   Lawmakers gave credit to Baker, a relative newcomer to theforeign-policy field, for earning their trust by sitting throughlong meetings with them, taking a non-ideological approach to thetalks and offering sincere pledges of good faith.   ``There's no question that he wanted to find the center ofgravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of ``swing'' voterson Contra aid in the past. ``He has been trying to build a policybased on political reality.''   ``He offered statements that he is going to not only be a partyto make the agreements and peace accords work, but that hepersonally would work against any secret military involvement,''added Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative Texas Democrat.   As for the audit on alleged torture by the Contras, it saidfemale prisoners between the ages of 15 and 25 reported being``raped and tortured by (Nicaraguan resistance) officials at thetime of their detention so they would confess to beinginfiltrators.''   Male prisoners detained on suspicion of infiltration or sabotageand spying also contended they had been tortured when they werepicked up and imprisoned in the log huts and barbed-wire enclosures,and one prisoner was killed during interrogation.   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said a rebel tribunal wasprosecuting at least one, and as many as four, suspects in the case,and would mete out appropriate punishment. ``We think it is tragic,lamentable,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
