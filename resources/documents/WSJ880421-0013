Two years before the 1990 census, questions are being raised over a Reagan administration decision that all but guarantees that minority groups won't be represented as accurately as whites in 1990 official population figures.    The controversy centers on a politically sensitive proposition: Should state and local population totals for blacks, Hispanics and others be adjusted upward in 1990 census totals to reflect the fact -- which everyone agrees is true -- that millions of these persons won't be found by normal census methods?    The administration says no. Top Census Bureau officials are defending that decision, saying that rejiggering the census totals will open a statistical can of worms. But a number of outside experts, including a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, argue just as strongly for adjusting the 1990 state and local census figures.    Power and money are at stake. Census figures are the basis for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and in state legislatures. According to one scenario, California could gain a House seat in the 1990s at the expense of Massachusetts if blacks, Hispanics and Asians are counted with the same accuracy as whites. Cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles would increase their clout in state legislatures if their minority residents are enumerated with precision.    Big-city mayors are especially pro-adjustment, because population and income data are the basis for handing out some $30 billion in federal grants. &quot;We're dollars-and-cents losers if we have an undercount of the minority population,&quot; says Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire.    The dispute has rocked the normally staid world of the Census Bureau. A senior bureau official even quit her job in protest, an unusual action in a low-profile agency where whistleblowers are a rarity. Barbara Bailar, associate director for research and a 29-year Census Bureau veteran, says the decision not to adjust 1990 census figures to compensate for the minority undercount was &quot;dressed up in technical language, but was a purely political decision.&quot;    Failure to adjust the population totals, &quot;when it visibly discriminates against minorities, the poor, the homeless, the inner cities and the young will surely raise suspicions about the integrity of the census,&quot; Ms. Bailar says.    Since many minority-group members tend to vote Democratic, some congressional Democrats echo the charge that raw partisanship is behind the administration's decision. But the politics of the issue aren't as simple as that. Lawmakers from rural areas also aren't anxious to see a change that would benefit the cities more in the competition for federal dollars.    Perhaps as a result, a bill that would overturn the administration decision and order the 1990 census adjusted hasn't attracted widespread enthusiasm in Congress to date.    Reagan administration officials don't dispute that many people will go uncounted in the census. But Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner says the political barbs are &quot;untrue and unfair.&quot; He argues that manufacturing new population figures after the basic census is run amounts to &quot;number shopping&quot; that would undermine the credibility of the census.    The administration says such a change would confuse the public and lead to charges of political tampering, an accusation that could hurt the Census Bureau's image of remaining aloof from partisan squabbles. Officials sketch a scenario where two sets of population figures -- unadjusted and adjusted -- could emerge for every locality, each set with its own advocates.    They also note that the &quot;corrected&quot; population numbers would be the product of a pioneering statistical technique that has majority, but not unanimous support, from demographers; alternate adjustment formulas could produce different numbers.    The heart of the matter is who gets counted, and who doesn't, in the decennial census. Ideally, everyone present in the U.S. on April 1, 1990, citizens and aliens alike, will be tallied. Most persons get census questionnaires by mail. Those who don't return them are supposed to get a personal visit from a census enumerator.    In practice, however, a lot of people fall through the census cracks. Low-income minorities, especially, may not be on post office lists that the census uses to contact people. Homeless people are tough to track. And multifamilies crowded into a single home or apartment may be understandably reluctant to list all the occupants, even under the census pledge of confidentiality.    Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) says that adjusting the census is the only way to get the roughly 100,000 people estimated to be living illegally in New York City public housing onto the population rolls. &quot;This is New York City, not a nice subdivision with tract houses,&quot; Mr. Schumer says.    Using follow-up surveys, the bureau figures its official 1980 national total of 226.5 million reflected only 98.6% of the actual population. Some 3.2 million persons, or 1.4% of the population, were missed. The bureau estimates that more than half of the missing persons, 1.7 million, were black males.    Overall, census officials figure that nearly 6% of both black and Hispanic populations went uncounted in 1980 while less than 1% of the white population was overlooked. While the bureau has improved its total coverage over the years, this &quot;differential undercount&quot; -- the share of uncounted minorities vs. the share of uncounted whites -- has stubbornly refused to close.    Even Census Bureau officials who support the administration's position concede that a sophisticated and hugely complex adjustment formula, developed since the 1980 census, would improve census accuracy. But using the formula would require time-consuming surveys and computer runs, and the bureau is required by law to deliver state population totals to the president by Dec. 31, 1990, just nine months after the census begins. So while adjustment is &quot;technically feasible,&quot; says William Butz, a census associate director, &quot;on operational grounds, I don't think we can do it.&quot;    One thing remains certain: The dispute will drag on for a long time. Fifty-two lawsuits were filed against the Census Bureau after the 1980 census, and officials are reconciled to more litigation on the adjustment issue after 1990. &quot;There'll be many suits, no matter what we do,&quot; says Mr. Butz. </TEXT></DOC>
