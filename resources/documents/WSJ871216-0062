All OTC indexes yesterday spurted past the Dow Jones industrials and other measures of larger stocks.    Value Line, a stock-market information company whose own stock price moves with the fortunes of medium-sized issues, soared 5 1/4 to 21 in yesterday's OTC buying wave, triggered by a report of hefty earnings gains for its second quarter. Well below its year-end 1986 price of 23 1/4 as the OTC market sagged, the stock practically recovered the difference in one day.    While the Dow and other indexes barely tipped upward yesterday, the Nasdaq composite rose 3.32 points, or 1.1%, to 312.68. And that index was damped by poor performance by most bank stocks, the largest Nasdaq group, which aren't participating in the rally.    The Nasdaq industrial index, which doesn't reflect the bank stocks, rose a heftier 4.50 points, or 1.4% to 318.72. Little assistance came from the giant OTC issues traded by the institutions, which generally corrected in price yesterday from Monday's gains.    Volume on the National Market System, where investors were doing most of their buying, soared to 121 million shares, a post-crash record. Full Nasdaq volume was 153 million shares; most of the 1,000 or so Nasdaq bank stocks trade off the National Market System.    Among the OTC giants yesterday, Apple Computer rose 1/4 to 37 1/2; but Sun Microsystems was off 1/2 to 30 1/2. Microsoft was up 1/2; but Lotus, another large software issue, fell 5/8 to 27 7/8. Intel, the biggest OTC semiconductor issue, fell 1/4 to 25 1/2. Genentech, the biggest OTC biotechnology stock, was off 1 to 36. The huge issues traded on relatively light volume; yesterday's volume came from mostly-depressed medium-sized and smaller stocks on which investors hope to make quantum gains in the revival.    Yesterday portfolio managers, according to traders, were buying medium-sized technology stocks, particularly computer issues. Their typical target was a stock already up 40% or so in price for the year, with growing earnings, and shares in the market place worth between $100 million and $300 million. Among such computer issues, EMC Corp. rose 2 3/4 to 14 3/4; American Management Systems rose 2 to 12 1/4, and First Financial Management was up 1 1/4 to 25. Among electronics stocks with the same prerequisites, Linear Technology rose 1 3/8 to 10 3/4; Diceon Electronics was up 2 3/4 to 28 1/2, and Chips and Technologies rose 1 1/2 to 13 3/4.    But investors also leapt into small and depressed issues. Among hardware issues Excelan rose 1 3/4 to 11 1/2. The issue -- with market value of $80 million -- was off 38% for the year before yesterday's 324,100 share buying spree. Among similarly situated computer stocks, Adeptec was up 1 1/2 to 7 1/4. System Software, rose 1 3/4 to 12 1/2; Sage Software rose 7/8 to 6 1/2.    Enthusiasm for the winter rally, according to traders, comes from speculators eager to catch crash-depressed OTC issues at their lowest price when the most shriveled issues become prey to selling for tax purposes by individuals this month. Investors hope such issues will be carried up in price enough in the winter rally to generate big gains, brokers report. They are hunting for $10 stocks that collapsed to $1 a share, which might briefly rise, for example, to $2.50 in the rally -- a $150 profit on a $100 investment.    And yesterday speculators were snapping up a number of depressed OTC stocks with market value below $50 million -- largely issues off in price for the year between 30 and 65%. Among smaller technology issues, Vodavi Technology rose 1 1/8 to 4; Domain Technology was up 1/2 to 3 3/4; Interspec was up 1 1/4 to 6 3/4.    But Nasdaq's most severely depressed stocks -- those down more than 70% in price -- were mixed, yesterday, on heavy volume, as some individual investors continued selling for tax reasons, while other speculators bought. Typically, Crazy Eddie rose 3/16 to 1 13/16 on nearly 300,000 shares; Stars To Go -- the fourth most depressed stock on Nasdaq -- rose 1/8 to 1 1/4. While Worlds of Wonder fell 3/16 to 1 1/8 and Aca Joe, slipped 1/32 to 15/32, in equally heavy trading.    The dangers of attempting such a strategy were illustrated yesterday by Melridge, a once high-flying cut-flower production company that has been among the most depressed OTC stocks, having slipped from 11 to 2 1/2. Yesterday Melridge filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and the price fell 1 3/16 further to 7/16. </TEXT></DOC>
