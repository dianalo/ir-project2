Method: Inorganic binders comprising silica sol,lithium silicate or mixtures thereof are added to radioactive wastesand, depending on the requirements, curing promotors and/or water proofnessimprover to the inorganic binders are further mixed and the resultantmixture is hardened by press-molding them into a pellet shape. Sincesuch binders are added and press-molded, it is possible to mold strongand long time durable pellets at a lower molding pressure than usual.(Takahashi, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
