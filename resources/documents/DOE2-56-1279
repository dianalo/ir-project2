It includeswelding head with programmed control of bead arrangement and system oftracking electrode position over edge height and width. The principleof operation of the tracking system and other units of welding equipmentis described. A series of SU-169 units was successfully introduced atBelgorod power engineering plant for circumferential welding of pipelinesof heat resisting steels 12Kh1MF and 15Kh1M1F. Application of SU-169units enabled to provide high quality of faced metal, to exclude completelydefect presence in welded joint.</TEXT></DOC>
