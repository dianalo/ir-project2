It was the first time the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,which dropped 0.3 percent in February, had posted back-to-backdeclines since it fell for five straight months from September 1987through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stockmarket crash.   While many analysts feared that the nation was headed for arecession after the market collapse, the economy rebounded withvigor and the record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year.   Analysts said the latest negative signals from the leading indexare in line with signs that the U.S. economy is losing steam andwith widespread expectations that the slowdown will become morepronounced as the year progresses.   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said thereport was ``not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy,which is probably good.''   ``Overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on asteady course,'' he said.   Looking at the overall picture, Fitzwater said, ``Despitedeclines in February and March, the average of the leadingindicators index for the first quarter is higher than the averagefor the fourth quarter of 1988. The index affirms the slowdown fromthe high levels of economic activity in 1988 and January of 1989.These declines probably are transitional movements to a sustainablerate of economic growth without accelerating inflation.''   The debate among economists is whether the end result will be anoutright recession or a so-called ``soft landing,'' in which growthslows just enough to relieve inflationary pressures withoutbringing a halt to the expansion.   The economy expanded at a strong 5.5 percent annual rate duringthe first three months of the year, but the growth in the grossnational product was a more modest 3 percent, discounting astatistical quirk reflecting the bounce back from last year'sdrought.   That was down somewhat from the drought-adjusted 3.5 percentpace for the final quarter of 1988. Monthly reports on theeconomy's performance in February and March suggested a progressiveweakening during the first quarter.   ``The underlying growth rate in the economy is much below lastyear and the risks of a recession certainly are higher,'' saideconomist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington. ``To bea prudent planner, you have to take those risks into account.''   March's decline in the leading index, which is designed topredict economic activity six to nine months into the future, wasthe biggest falloff since a 0.8 percent drop last July.   The traditional signal of a recession is three straight declinesin the index. However, it has flashed two false recession signalssince the 1981-82 economic downturn, one of them in the monthsafter the stock market crash.   In March, nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leadingindex declined, with a drop in building permits counting as thebiggest negative factor.   Other negatives included: a dip in manufacturers' orders forconsumer goods; a shorter average work week; an increase in initialclaims for jobless benefits; a drop in an index measuring consumerconfidence; faster vendor deliveries, signaling slower demand; acontraction in the money supply; a decline in manufacturers'unfilled orders and falling stock prices.   Two indicators made positive contributions: a jump in prices forraw materials, indicating stronger demand; and a gain in orders fornew plants and equipment.   The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982base of 100. The index has advanced 0.5 percent over the past sixmonths, compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the previoussix-month period.   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing upinterest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and controlinflation. The goal of the anti-inflation campaign is to prolongthe economic recovery, but some analysts think the unintentionalresult will be a recession.   ``The leading indicator is just another indicator of how theeconomy has slowed down,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist forManufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. ``We're at a point nowwhere if the Federal Reserve doesn't back off, the slowdown couldvery easily become a recession by or before the end of the year.''   The Bush administration is projecting the economy will expand ata moderate 3.2 percent pace this year.   J. Antonio Villamil, chief economist for the CommerceDepartment, said after the first-quarter GNP report was released onWednesday that ``there is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989from these numbers.''   He said the nation is experiencing ``solid, moderate growth withthe kind of mix we need at this stage of the expansion.''   However, the latest consensus estimate from 50 analysts surveyedby the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter is less optimistic,projecting this year's growth rate at 2.7 percent, with the paceslipping to 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter.   More than half of those surveyed now expect a recession to beginby late this year or early in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
