Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AEG LABOR </CO><IN> TNM AIR </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilots' union at Allegis Corp. made a conditional proposal to acquire the parent of United Airlines for $110 a share, or an indicated $2.37 billion.    The proposal, made in a letter to Allegis Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, calls for a negotiated transaction under which the pilots and &quot;other participating employees&quot; at Allegis would acquire the surviving company through one or more employee stock ownership plans.    But Airline Acquisition Corp., the company formed by the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, said it won't be able to proceed until it wins a lawsuit filed last week against the company and its machinists' union. That suit, which could take months or longer to resolve, claims that provisions in the machinists' contract amount to a &quot;poison pill&quot; to prevent a change in control of the company.    A proposal by the pilots union in April 1987 to buy United from Allegis helped lead to Allegis's restructuring and sale of its hotel and rental car assets.    The pilots' latest announcement, made shortly before the close of trading, helped send Allegis stock up $5.25, to $90, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    But it drew cool responses. Mr. Wolf said in a statement that Allegis &quot;will respond as soon as we have had a chance to understand whether this is a valid offer.&quot;    Machinists' union officials couldn't be reached for comment, but their financial adviser, Brian M. Freeman, said &quot;the bottom line in my judgment is it's inconceivable to me (the pilots) will win on their lawsuit.&quot;    Added Pat Friend, head of the flight attendants' union at United: &quot;My initial reaction is (the proposal) is no more compelling than any proposal they made in the past.&quot; She added that some of her union members think an employee stock ownership plan &quot;may just be a luxury the flight attendants can't afford.&quot;    The pilots said in the eight-page letter to Mr. Wolf that they will try to get the flight attendants and machinists to &quot;participate in the ESOP in exchange for some level of cost reductions.&quot; But they added that the proposal &quot;can and would&quot; be implemented if one or both of the unions decide not to participate.    The pilots said their own union has agreed to wage cuts and other concessions which, together with savings from concessions from non-contract employees, would save about $350 million a year.    Total funds needed to complete the proposed merger, to refinance certain existing debt and pay related fees and expenses were put at about $4.06 billion. The letter said the money would come from a term loan facility of as much as $3.1 billion to be provided by a syndicate of banks led by Chemical Bank, the sale of $800 million of subordinated notes in the surviving corporation and the sale to the pilots' pension plan of at least $200 million in preferred stock in the surviving corporation.    Airline Acquisition, whose pilot-appointed chairman is former Piedmont Aviation Inc. Chairman William R. Howard, said it has received &quot;highly confident&quot; letters from Chemical Bank on the senior debt financing and Salomon Brothers Inc. on the subordinated debt.    The letter also said Mr. Howard would be chairman of the surviving corporation and that it would be run by &quot;qualified professional management&quot; with a board &quot;structured to be truly independent.&quot;    Separately, United Airlines said it will modify its no-smoking rule to include flights of 1,000 miles or less, effective June 1. The carrier said the move, intended to make the current two-hour, no-smoking ban easier to understand, would add 53 routes to its list of non-smoking flights. </TEXT></DOC>
