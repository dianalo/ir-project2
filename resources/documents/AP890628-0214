Reviews are mixed, but it's doubtfulthat Capitol Hill critics will force a major rewrite of thehackneyed old script.   For one thing, the law _ properly, the Food Security Act of 1985_ allowed the Agriculture Department to reduce some of the subsidiesand price formulas tied to certain commodities such as wheat, cornand cotton.   The law and USDA decisions it permitted have effectively reducedsome of the high price supports that many economists say had pricedthe United States out of international export markets. With lowerprices, U.S. grain has been better able to compete, they say.   But much of the 1985 farm law resembles its ancestors going backto the 1930s by authorizing production controls when deemedappropriate, and providing basic price supports to designatedcommodities.   Despite a mathematical chance of an ideological upheaval inCongress over farm policy and whether to get the government out ofthe commodity markets once and for all, the odds greatly favor acontinuation of the present system _ with a little tinkering hereand there.   And guess what? Even if Congress fails to write a new farm bill,the government programs would simply revert to ``permanentlegislation'' written in 1949 and 1933.   Susan L. Pollack of the department's Economic Research Servicesays the issues currently facing lawmakers include ways of cuttingcosts, more flexibility for crop plantings, trade liberalization,food safety, environmental concerns, rural development, nutritionand hunger, and research.   The Bush administration and many members of Congress haveexpressed satisfaction with the 1985 farm law, despite some recordoutlays for commodity programs, she said.   In fiscal 1984, spending by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. onvarious programs, including feed grains, wheat, rice, cotton,tobacco, dairy, soybeans, honey, wool and disaster assistance,totaled about $7.3 billion.   Spending in 1985 rose to $17.7 billion, and in 1986, climbed to arecord of more than $25.8 billion. Costs dropped to $22.4 billion in1987, to $12.5 billion in 1988, and are expected to edge up to $13.8billion in 1989. The forecast for 1990 currently is $11.6 billion,less than half the earlier peak.   ``Strong pressure to cut domestic spending, however, willcontinue to force lawmakers to scrutinize farm program costs,''Pollack said in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.``Cost-cutting proposals have included further reductions in targetprices (used to determine subsidies, or ``deficiency'' payments tofarmers), setting target prices to reflect the costs of production,and establishing more flexible acreage bases.''   A so-called triple-base concept advocated since 1985 by Rep.Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, would give farm participants the optionof planting a crop of their choice on part of their acreage basewithout losing acreage credit.   Pollack said the concept would continue to divide a farmer'stotal crop base into ``permitted acreage'' and acreage idled underthe Acreage Reduction Program, or ARP. But the permitted acreagewould be divided further into a base for program crops that wouldcontinue to be eligible for federal payments, and a ``flexible''base.   Crops produced on the flexible base would not be eligible fordeficiency payments.   ``Proponents hope the triple base concept would decrease federalexpenses by cutting the number of acres receiving payments, whilegiving farmers more flexibility as to what they can plant,'' shesaid. ``And the triple base would continue the movement toward amore market-oriented agriculture.''   One of the heavyweight issues for 1990 farm legislation continuesto be agricultural trade. U.S. farm exports, in the doldrums a fewyears ago, have improved substantially, partly because of aggressiveoverseas selling policies, including export subsidies to offsetsimilar competition from the European Economic Community.   ``Congressional observers expect the new farm bill to continueboosting U.S. farm exports with targeted subsidies and to keep thepressure on other nations for trade reforms,'' Pollack said.   Meanwhile, if current trade negotiations under the Uruguay Roundare successful, the new farm bill would have to be amended toreflect such changes. Those amendments to the 1990 farm law,however, would take place after negotiations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade are completed.   Some other issues that Pollack said are becoming more importantto farm bill debate:   _Food safety and groundwater contamination. Recent concerns aboutthe chemical Alar used on apples are examples, along with continuedproblems with poultry and meat inspection. Establishing seafoodinspection, and the labeling of food products to disclose moreinformation about cholesterol, sodium, fat and calorie content offood are other possible issues.   _Low-input agriculture, which calls for less chemical fertilizersand pesticides. One bill, by Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., would usecash incentives and tax breaks to encourage farmers to voluntarilyreview farm chemical use, and to cut back where possible.   _Rural development. Many bills have been introduced to improverural health services, education, transportation and water systems.A comprehensive bill by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., includes loansand grant programs that would involve all levels of government andthe private sector.   _Crop insurance. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has toldCongress the program needs to be overhauled. The administration alsosays drought-relief legislation forces the taxpayer to subsidizethose farmers who choose not to buy crop insurance.   _Sugar program. Critics say the system of limiting imports ofsugar through quotas to maintain higher domestic prices should bechanged. Defenders say it has worked well to protect U.S. sugarinterests and the American consumer.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 2</NOTE></DOC>
