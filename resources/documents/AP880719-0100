Today's Democratic Convention session wasmoved up to allow more time for debate.   Jackson officials, in a written notice, said today there wouldbe debate on three planks for which he had filed minority versions_ higher taxes on the wealthy, no first use of nuclear weapons andPalestinian self-determination in the Middle East.   However, they said they would not press the Middle East issue toa vote.   The Dukakis delegates were expected to easily defeat Jackson onthe higher-taxes and nuclear-weapons issues, but today's conventionstarting time was moved up from 4:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. EDT to allowtime to air the issues.   The Jackson campaign's major concession was to drop a call for afive-year freeze on Pentagon spending.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's chief platform negotiator, tolda news conference, ``Jackson has had a grater impact on thisplatform than any candidate other than a nominee in memory.''   She said of the Palestinian homeland issue on CBS-TV today,``Our supporters were anxious to have the issue debated, notnecesssarily voted. ... What was sought was an agreement that wouldkeep our party together and avoid the dissonance.''   But she said in regard to the Jackson plank that would pledge nofirst use of nuclear weapons, ``We are going to the floor on that.The Soviet Union has said it. It's much more in the Americantradition to say that.''   Current U.S. and NATO policy would allow first use in the eventof a Soviet invasion of Europe.   The Jackson campaign, in its written update, said, ``We havereached common ground on nine of the minority planks advocated byour campaign,'' including acceptance of Jackson's minority plank onthe budget.   That plank says, ``Investing in America and reducing the deficitrequires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share andthat we restrain Pentagon spending.''   Other Jackson proposals will be included in the platformcompromise language, including expanded support for prenatal care,Head Start and education.   The platform negotiators resumed their talks Monday after asix-day hiatus caused by tension between Jackson and Dukakis.   The Jackson campaign said that ``our major impact on theplatform has been in the document itself (which) already reflectsthe guiding principles of our campaign: declaring South Africa aterrorist state, our five-point program to fight drugs, politicalempowerment and many more.''   Campaign lieutenants negotiated late into the night over thedetails of resolving the minority positions Jackson wanted in thestreamlined, 4,500-word platform.   ``I expect we won't have a marathon session,'' Michigan Gov.James J. Blanchard, chairman of the platform committee, said Monday.   Blanchard says the platform, shorn of the usual special-interestrhetoric, is compact enough to fit on a poster.   The agreement not to wage a drawn-out platform fight followed aMonday morning meeting in which Jackson pledged party unity andMichael Dukakis promised to increase Jackson's role in the party.   The platform talks had been suspended last Tuesday when Dukakisfailed to give Jackson early notice of his selection of LloydBentsen as a running mate.   Both Dukakis and Jackson said they anticipated some issues wouldbe left to the 4,162 delegates to decide.   Jackson said Monday night on the Cable News Network: ``Therewill be key planks to be debated tomorrow night. ... We arecommitted to having new budget priorities.''   Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a co-chair of the PlatformCommittee, said early today he thought there would be just ``aslight floor fight.''   Richardson said defense was where the Jackson forces had ``thechance to make the most inroads'' on Dukakis' majority.   In a Platform Committee session in Denver June 25, the Dukakisforces rejected several cornerstone Jackson campaign positions,including his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, a Pentagonbudget freeze, Palestinian self-determination and a U.S. policy ofno first use of nuclear weapons.   Actor Ed Begley of television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' a Dukakisdelegate from California, was among many delegates sporting ``NoFirst Use'' stickers at Monday night's opening session.   Other Jackson minority planks called for full funding of HeadStart and the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, anddoubling the education budget.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told the 751 labor delegatesthey were free ``to dance with the candidates you came with'' onplatform fights. The National Education Association, which has 291delegates, voted Sunday to take Jackson's side on the educationplank.   The 4,500-word proposed platform is the Democrats' shortest infive decades.   Borrowing a phrase from Republican nominee-to-be George Bush, itpromises to reverse the ``voodoo economics'' of the Reaganadministration, bolster programs for the needy and maintain ``morestable defense budgets.'' Tailored largely to Dukakis'specifications, it includes many of Jackson's positions as well,including a condemnation of South Africa as ``a terrorist state.''   The platform is the main order of convention business todaybefore a prime-time speech by Jackson.</TEXT></DOC>
