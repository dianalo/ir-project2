Management measures for 1988were effective on May 1, 1988 (53 FR 16002, May 4, 1988). The recreationalfishery for all salmon species in the area from the Orford Reef Red Buoy,Oregon, to Horse Mountain, California, began on May 28, 1988, and was adjustedby notice on July 12, 1988 (53 FR 26599, July 14, 1988) by reducing thedaily bag limit from two salmon of any species to one salmon of any species.The notice of July 12 also provided that no person may use more than onerod and line while recreationally fishing in the area from the Oregon-Californiaborder to Point Delgada, California (40anddegrees;01andmin172;24&quot; N. lat.).This fishery for Orford Reef Red Buoy to Horse Mountainis scheduled toend September 11, 1988, and the inseason adjustment (53 FR 26599, July14, 1988) will continue to have effect in the designated areas.Since the subarea from Trinidad Head to Punta Gorda is within the largerareas of Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon to Horse Mountain, California, andthe area from the Oregon-California border to Point Delgada, restrictionsfrom this earlier inseason adjustment apply to recreational fishery forall salmon species in the subarea from Trinidad Head to Punta Gorda, California.The fishery in the subarea from Trinidad Head to Punta Gorda begins onSeptember 12 and will continue through September 30, 1988 (53 FR 16010,May 4, 1988). This fishery is not governed by quotas. In order to allowmaximum harvest of coho and chinook salmon in the subarea, from TrinidadHead to Punta Gorda it is necessary to change the inseason daily bag limitand gear restrictions, established in the notice of July 12 and restorethe preseason regulations, which provide for a two fish daily bag limitand no limit on the number of lines which may be used.The one-rod limit also changed in the area between Horse Mountain and PointDelgada for the recreational fishery, which is continuing in the area.This area is part of the larger area from Horse Mountain to the U.S.-Mexicoborder.Therefore, NOAA issues this notice to adjust the recreational salmon fisheryin the EEZ from Trinidad Head to Punta Gorda, and Point Delgada, California,by increasing the recreational daily bag limit to two salmon of any speciesand modifying the gear restriction such that there is no limit to the numberof lines that a person may use while recreationally fishing off California,effective at 0001 hours local time, September 12, 1988. The one-rod limitis also lifted in the area between Horse Mountain and Point Delgada forthe recreational fishery, which is continuing in that area. This noticedoes not apply to other fisheries which may be operating in other areas.The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council and the California Department of Fish and Game regardingthis inseason adjustment to the recreational fishery. The State of Californiawill manage the recreational fishery in State waters adjacent to this areaof the EEZ in accordance with this Federal action.Any delay in taking this action would result in failure to maximize theallowable harvest of coho and chinook salmon. Because of the need for immediateaction, the Secretary of Commerce had determined that good cause existsfor this notice to be issued without affording a prior opportunity forpublic comment. Therefore, public comments on this notice will be acceptedfor 15 days after the effective date, through September 27, 1988.Federal regulations at 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(iii)-(iv) authorize changesin recreational bag limits and establishment or modification of gear restrictionsif certain findings are made as described in the appendix to 50 CFR Part661, Section III.B. Accordingly, the Regional Director has determined thisinseason adjustment is consistent with fishery regimes established by theU.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, ocean escapement goals, conservationof the salmon resource, any adjudicated fishing rights, and the ocean allocationscheme in the FMP. This inseason adjustment is based on consideration ofthe amount of recreational catch of coho and chinook salmon and recreationaleffort in the area to date, the estimated average daily catch per recreationalfisherman, and the predicted recreational fishing effort for the area tothe end of the scheduled season.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(iii)-(iv) and is in compliancewith Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ann D.
