Gorbachev's reformsare ``skidding.''   Nearly four years after launching an ambitious modernizationprogram to raise living standards and open its long-closed societyto public scrutiny, the party said, ``The economy has not yet begunto operate in a new way. People have not yet come to feel fully theresults of restructuring.''   The expectations raised by perestroika, Gorbachev's reformprogram, are far from being met, the platform said. ``Progress insome areas, including the social sphere, is skidding.''   The platform was adopted by the Central Committee at a plenarymeeting on Tuesday and published in full by Tass on Thursday.   At the same meeting, the leadership picked Gorbachev and 99 othertop officials of the ruling party to run for election to the party's100 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies.   Despite a new election law allowing ``an unlimited number ofcandidates'' to participate in the March 26 election, the moveguaranteed the top Communist leaders uncontested seats in the new2,250-member parliament, which will elect the nation's president anda full-time legislature.   The party's first priority is ``a solution to the most acuteissue: the food problem,'' the platform said. But it offered fewclues to how it would accomplish that, saying only that the CentralCommittee soon will hold another plenary session to take steps ``tomeet the population's requirements for foodstuffs more quickly.''   Meat, butter, sugar and other staples are rationed throughoutmuch of the country and are in short supply elsewhere, even in thenational capital, where there are numerous complaints in newspapersand on the streets that the food situation is worse now than whenGorbachev assumed power in March 1985.   The party also conceded people continue to wait ``for asufficient amount of high-quality industrial goods to appear onsale,'' but it said a substantial amount of money is being spent tomodernize light industry, and that some defense plants are beingconverted to civilian use.   The platform also promised the party would ``do everythingnecessary ... to provide each family with a self-contained apartmentor a house by the year 2000.'' Twenty percent of Soviet families nowshare living quarters with other, unrelated families. In someregions, families must live in dormitories because no apartments areavailable.   Among other campaign promises, the party pledged:   _A new pension law increasing payments to retirees andestablishing a uniform pension plan for industrial and officeworkers and collective farmers.   _Overhaul of the judicial system and adoption of laws tostrengthen individual rights ``an equality of everyone before thelaw.''   _Expanding the rights of the nation's 15 constituent republicsand stengthening their ``sovereignty'' within the Soviet system,which divides authority between the central government and therepublics but traditionally has reserved most power inside theKremlin.   In foreign policy, the Central Committee declared, ``The Cold Waris retreating'' and said prospects are good for achieving aU.S.-Soviet pact on reduction of long-range nuclear weaponsfollowing implementation of a treaty eliminating intermediate-rangemissiles.   ``We are doing all we can for an early settlement to the Afghanproblem, for completion of Soviet troop withdrawal in keeping withthe Geneva accords,'' the platform said.   A U.N.-brokered agreement calls for the last Soviet forces to beout of Afghanistan by Feb. 15, but officials have indicated they maynot meet that deadline. The Kremlin has been working to arrange anegotiated settlement of the protracted civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
