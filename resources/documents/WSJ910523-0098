The new product marks a major debut in the nascent marketfor so-called multimedia products by what is perhaps theworld's best-known maker of consumer electronics. Sony'sLaser Library, which includes six disks and a CD-ROM playerthat can be easily hooked up to a personal computer with ascrewdriver, is viewed as an aggressively priced entry in therelatively new field.</LP><TEXT>   CD-ROM, compact disk -- read only memory, delivers reamsof text, digital sound, color photographs, and limited-motionvideo to computer users via an optical-laser reader hooked upto a personal computer. Sony has been an enormous success inconsumer electronics, giving the world the VCR and theubiquitous Walkman. The question is whether it can fare aswell in what is a narrower, fledgling market.   Though Sony owns the Columbia Pictures movie studio andthe former CBS Records, seemingly rich areas for multimediaproducts, Sony has filled the Laser Library's disks withmaterial licensed from other electronic publishers. LaserLibrary will include Compton's Encyclopedia, NationalGeographic's Mammals, a 12-language translating dictionary, aworld atlas, a reference library, and &quot;Mixed-Up MotherGoose,&quot; an educational video game.   Sony said the Laser Library is eventually meant for a massaudience, but CD-ROM usage is anything but mass. About 15million homes have PCs, including six million IBM-compatiblemachines, which will be able to use the Laser Library. ButSony executives estimate that only 500,000 PCs so far areusing CD-ROM drives in schools, government offices,businesses and homes, and homes probably comprise thesmallest segment.   &quot;We want to be the market leader in CD-ROM the way we arein other areas of electronics,&quot; said Leslie A. Inanchy,marketing manager of Sony's CD-ROM division. &quot;The market maybe small, but the Sony name puts us in a good position.&quot;   Sony's introduction yesterday was timed as a buildup tothe opening of the Summer Consumer Electronics Show next weekin Chicago, where thousands of storechain buyers andenthusiasts will converge to check out the latest gear. Sonystaged a press conference at the Algonquin Hotel, purposelytrumpeting its &quot;electronic books&quot; at the literary hangout ofa bygone era.   The Laser Library is planned to hit store shelves inAugust in time for the back-to-school season, selling firstthrough computer retailers. Sony looks eventually to sign upmass-market retailers such as Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.   Sony wants to use the leverage of its popular name inconsumer electronics to gain the advantage in the CD-ROMmarket. But some industry executives worry that Sony coulduse strong-arm tactics to get its CD-ROM titles into stores,stymying attempts by smaller electronic publishers in theburgeoning field.   &quot;Good luck to any other publisher trying to get theirproduct on a shelf that is occupied by a Sony package,&quot; saidLinda Helgerson, publisher of CD-ROM Enduser magazine. &quot;Sonyhas tons of bucks they can play with, and a lot of thepublishers don't.&quot;   Sony's Mr. Inanchy countered: &quot;We don't want to put otherpublishers out of business. The more interesting product outthere, the larger the market will be. What's been lacking isinteresting disks that the whole family could use.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
