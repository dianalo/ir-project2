The 46-year-old film wasthought to have been destroyed by Mussolini.   ``We The Living'' was made in war-time Italy in 1942, and wasbased on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose``objectivism'' philosphy in such works as ``The Fountainhead'' and``Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s.   The movie has caused a stir over the years, and has repeatedlywon critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to theFourth Annual Boston Film Festival last month.   A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed,romantic saga is set in Russia as the tidal wave of revolutionboiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes inthe way people lived and loved and survived.   Rossano Brazzi co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who can't geta job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out offashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her firstlook at the film when he met her in Hollywood after the war.However, he didn't think Italy's fascist government had ordered themovie to be destroyed.   It went out of circulation because the ``natural life of thefilm was over,'' Brazzi said in a telephone interview from his homein Rome.   But Massimo Ferrara-Santamaria, a Rome lawyer who was generalmanager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was calledbefore a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives andcopies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studioand as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making themovie.   ``In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called bythe public `Noi Morti' (`We the Dead'),'' he said in an interview,adding that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned thefilm in Germany after Ferrara personally showed it at Goebbels'Berlin home in October 1942.   ``At the end of the screening, Goebbels told me that theRussians were habitually presented to the German public in a muchmore negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was nogood for Germany,'' he said.   Erika and Henry Mark Holzer, the movie's producers, were Rand'slawyers in the 1960s. Mrs. Holzer said the author believed thebanning story and authorized a search for the film that took thetwo attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. Itfinally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with ``abunch of Italian films for sale.''   They rode through the bumpy back streets of Rome with a load ofpotentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an oldtruck, including the negative for ``We the Living.'' They had themovie transferred to ``safety film'' before flying it back to NewYork.   Mrs. Holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative,which Ferrara had hidden.   Ferrara and others say Italy's Ministry of Culture ordered thefilm destroyed about five months after its release on the groundsthat though the message might purport to be anti-communist, itcould also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement forindividualism, regardless of political coloration.   The fascists didn't want that kind of propaganda message playingon the homefront with Italy's Axis troops stretched from NorthAfrica to Stalingrad, and the Allies storming the beaches of Sicily.   Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was bestexemplified by Gary Cooper in the ``Fountainhead,'' who played anarchitect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to bedesecrated by the whims of popularism.   Mrs. Holzer said Rand liked the film version of ``We theLiving'' even more than ``The Fountainhead,'' although the authorhad written the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked forpermission for the Italian film.   Brazzi said it was a so-called war movie: ``We'll worry afterthe war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receivecompensation from Scalera, the producing studio.   Mrs. Holzer said that once she and her husband recovered anoriginal nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame byframe to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italianversion was made in two parts and ran over 4{ hours. The projectwas set aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not pickedup until after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored byDuncan Scott.   The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italianwar-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships andPetrograd.   ``I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in Italywas used as extras,'' Mrs. Holzer said.   The new version, distributed by Angelika Films, is under threehours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in Boston, Nov. 11 in LosAngeles and Nov. 25 in New York. It will play to other major U.S.markets before January.   The film also stars a young and radiant Alida Valli, the femalelead in the 1949 British thriller, ``The Third Man''; and FoscoGiachetti, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in Italy when themovie was made, according to its producers.   ``We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful Kiraloves Leo, the tubercular aristocat; Andrei of the dreaded secretpolice loves Kira because she has the courage to be independent anddefiant of the new order.   But underneath the suds is a hard reality: Kira forsakes herlove when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. Andreikills himself when he realizes first that Kira used him to get Leoa spot in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedomfor individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel orsaint.   Kira goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strongand the living, and the survival of the toughest.   Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfetteredcapitalism and ``rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom asthe highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed itfor much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians ofthe right who often identified with her philosophy.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, Nov. 3</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
