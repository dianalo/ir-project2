This technology can also be used to produce two-dimensionalgrids and particulates of different sizes and geometries. This experimentalapproach allows an unprecedented control of dimensions, geometry, composition,and structure. The initial materials foci of the proposed program werealumina (Al{sub 2}0{sub 3}) and the mixed metal oxides of alumina withmetal solutes, and intermetallic compounds such as the nickel and titaniumaluminides. 5 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
