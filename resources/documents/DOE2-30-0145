As a result, a measured critical inlet flow anglefor the diffuser with the largest radius ratio of 3.35 was the largestone in the experiment and it was close to a predicted value. As a radiusratio was less than 2.35, a measured value was less than a predictedvalue, and thus a predicted value gave a safety value. For the diffuserswith a radius ratio of 2.35 or less, a non-dimentional form of a rotationalspeed of cells expressed exactly the effects of a exit radius and flowperipheral speed. The predicting equations of rotational speeds of cellswere available over wide ranges of a non-dimentional width and a diffuserradius ratio. In spite of the predicting method of rotational speedsof cells was very simple, it was practical with the good agreement betweenpredicted values and measured values.
