The convenience store operator said Reddy Ice is the largest producer of fragmentary ice in the world.    The sale is part of Southland's divestiture of 7-Eleven stores and other assets to finance the $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out of the company, completed in December, by an investment firm controlled by Southland's founding family, the Thompsons of Dallas. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
