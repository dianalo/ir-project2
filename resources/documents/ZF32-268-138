 Whilethe first camper cowers in fear, the second rummages for his track shoes.andO;&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; the first camper asks.andP;  &quot;You can't outrun a bear!&quot;andM;&quot;I don't have to,&quot; his friend replies.andP;  &quot;I just have to outrun you.&quot;andM;The goal of a footrace is to outrun the competition, even if just slightly.andO;The footrace mentality now seems to permeate the microprocessor industry.andO;Each new chip tries to be just a little bit faster or a little more versatilethan the chips it hopes to displace.andP;  Benchmark studies proclaim performance&quot;winners,&quot; even when the margin is slight.andM;But there's more than one way to win in the microprocessor arena, as seen inthe opposing strategies of Intel and Motorola.andP;  These folks have been playinga game of technological one-upmanship for years.andP;  The 8080 and 6800 foughtfor many of the same sockets, as did the 8086 and 68000, the 286 and 020, andthe 386 and 030.andP;  In each case a less aggressive Intel part was generallyavailable first.andP;  In each case Motorola responded by offering a little bitmore: two accumulators instead of one, more or larger general-purposeregisters, 24 address bits instead of 20, flat addressing rather than memorysegmentation.andP;  System architects and academics were duly impressed, andpronounced the Motorola device aesthetically cleaner, but by the timeMotorola had hit the streets, Intel would have had some significant designwins locked up.andM;Competition in the PC and workstation markets is less direct; still, therivalry continues.andP;  As the two leading CISC processors, comparisons betweenthe Intel 80486 and the Motorola 68040 are inevitable.andP;  In many ways the twoare well matched.andP;  Each was constrained to be user-mode compatible with itsforerunners.andP;  Each provides an integer unit, floating-point unit, pagedmemory-management system, and 8K bytes of cache on-chip.andP;  Each consumes 1.2million transistors, and each initially runs at 25 MHz.andM;Ironically, the parts will seldom compete for the same sockets.andP;  Strategicalliances in the PC and workstation worlds were drawn years ago, based onsoftware compatibility corners, not the merits of competing implementations.andO;IBM and PC-clone makers aren't going to joing the Motorola camp to pick up alittle speed, nor will Motorola devotees switch to the 486.andP;  However, the twochips do effectively demonstrate their vendors' competing product developmentstrategies.andP;  Once again, the Intel part arrived first.andP;  Once again, Motorolaattempted a more aggressive design.andM;Strategy #1: Push Performance to the LimitandM;The 040 specs are indeed impressive.andP;  Its pipeline is more elaborate and itscontrol logic more intricate.andP;  As a result, the 040 performs branchesslightly faster than the 486, and can complete read/modify/write sequences tocache in one or two clock cycles instead of three.andP;  The 040 FPU replacesmicrocode with combinational logic, so common operations are significantlyfaster.andM;The 040 cache design is just as sophisticated.andP;  It handles both write-throughand copy-back operation, while the 486 does write-through only.andP;  It hasbetter support for second-level caches, and its bus-snooping facilities aremore versatile.andP;  These factors can sometimes be significant.andM;Motorola's underlying process technology is equally aggressive.andP;  Certaincircuit blocks run internally at twice the frequency of a similarly-spec'ed486, and the 040 combines 1[mu] and .8andlsqb;mu] layout design rules in criticaltiming paths.andP;  Since random control logic takes up more chip area, the 040die is about 40% larger.andP;  All told, Motorola feels this extra sophisticationwas worth it, and should let the 040 outrun the 486 in real-worldapplications by up to 25%.andM;The actual performance edge won't be known, of course, until commercialsystems based on the 040 reach the market.andP;  But whatever the edge, it remainsto be seen whether better performance will really make any difference.andM;Strategy #2: Get a Good Head StartandM;An apparent flaw in Motorola's strategy is its assumption that microprocessorselection is based strictly on technological superiority.andP;  In the real world,being early to market can make up for a multitude of sins.andM;Intel engineers privately admit to compromises in the design of the 486, andconcede that certain features and options were left off, provided theomission (in Intel's view) was well-justified.andP;  Some trade-offs were madebecause engineers felt the possible benefit of a feature didn't justify theadded transistor count and die cost.andP;  Others, however, were made mainly tostreamline the design cycle.andP;  Copy-back cache support could have beenincluded, Intel says, but doing so would have increased the design time,testing, and verification cycles by three months or more.andM;Intel was committed to sampling 486 first silicon.andP;  Trying to get theboundary conditions right on an already comple design opens an incredible canof worms.andP;  When data objects may reside simultaneously in external memory,on-chip caches, write-back buffers, and on the bus pins, the difficulty inensuring data coherency, the number of special conditions that must behandled, the number of potential hazards that might arise, and the complexityof the design all rise formidably.andM;And the more elaborate the control logic, Intel feared, the greater the riskthat bugs might evade detection during pre-tapeout simulation.andP;  A fatal bugin the silicon could have delayed 486 product sampling by another threemonths.andP;  Even a trivial change to the programming model (as Intel laterdiscovered) could prevent existing software from running on the new CPU.andO;Intel simply did not want to take any chances.andM;Despite this conservatism, the first round of 486 silicon, received in Marchof '89, was not perfect.andP;  Three additional steppings were needed to changethe cache control logic, patch the FPU microcode, and fix minor bugs in theinterrupt system before the chip finally matched its (revised) data sheet.andO;Even so, the early bugs were not fatal.andP;  The first silicon was functionalenough to demonstrate working OS and applications software at the SpringComdex just two weeks later, and to begin general sampling of the partimmediately.andM;This let system designers finish wringing out their systems while Intelfinished wring out the CPU.andP;  As a result, the processor in now doing quitewell, thank you.andP;  The Sunday papers and the pages of Infoworld are filledwith ads for a range of 486-based systems, and more are announced weekly.andO;Intel Executive V.P.andP;  Craig Barrett has stated that 100,000 units wereexpected to be shipped by the end of March.andP;  Had the 486 designers attempteda more aggressive design, more like the 040, introduction might not have goneas smoothly.andM;Historical PrecedentsandM;The original 8086/68000 showdown serves as an interesting precedent.andP;  Therumors reported here earlier ([mu]PR 2/21/90 p.12) were not quite correct --the original 8086 family architecture was defined by just two guys, notthree, huddled in a corner office, not a hotel, over a two week period.andP;  Theywanted to define a full memory-management system (essentially what was laterto be come the 286) as well, but doing a decent job would have taken an extraweek, and there was simply no time in the schedule: the overriding constraintpassed down by management was that 1000 working parts had to be ondistributor shelves within 18 months.andP;  As is, portions of the originalspecification, such as a separate segment-limit register corresponding toeach of the segment-base registers, were later removed to reduce chip areaand save layout time.andM;That Intel was more concerned with schedule than architectural elegance mayseen appalling, but from a business perspective it turned out to be the rightthing to do.andP;  The 8086 beat the 6800 to the market by about a year.andP;  It'sthought that IBM chose the 8086 family over the 68K for the PC largelybecause by 1981 Intel had a slightly longer production track record, andbecause its earlier availability had let third-party software developmentbegin earlier.andP;  Had the 8086 hit a major snag in its development, or had the68K arrived sooner, the 80x86 dynasty might have died in infancy.andM;The industry is filled with examples of inferior products holding onto aninitial lead over a later, more sophisticated design.andP;  The Macintosh isclearly more elegant than the PC and its clones, yet accounts for only afraction of the market.andP;  The NeXT machine technically outruns the Mac, yetenjoys an even smaller share.andM;Who Needs the 040?andM;The most promising market for the 040 is clearly among system vendors alreadyusing 68030, but it's not at all clear which of these areperformance-critical.andP;  Apple in particular has always favored systemcost-reduction techniques over performance optimization.andP;  The 030 has beenavailable at 50 MHz for nearly a year, yet it was only within the last monththat Apple announced even a 40-MHz Mac II.andP;  NeXT is likely to adopt the 040,but it will be a long time -- if ever -- before their sales can keep awater-fab line afloat.andM;Where performance matters most is within the workstation market, in which030-based systems are now at a disadvantage.andP;  Compared to the current 030,even a slightly slower, slightly less sophisted 040 would still have offeredmajor improvements in performance, integration level, ease of interfacing,and so forth.andP;  The longer workstation designers were forced to wait for an030 replacement, though, the more likely they were to consider radicallydifferent alternatives.andM;Which they did.andP;  Motorola's is now losing 030 workstation sockets not to the486, nor even the 88K, but primarily to other RISC CPUs.andP;  But by the time the040 enters productions, now scheduled for June, much of the workstationmarket will have moved on.andP;  Had Motorola aspired to a less elegant, morepragmatic design, the 040 might have arrived sooner, and Motorola might havebeen able to limit RISC inroads.andP;  As is, the question of just how high the040's performance is when it finally ships may be moot.andM;Getting back to our bear-infested campsite: the first camper's best strategywould have been to get out of the tent and start running, even in his barefeet.andP;  By the time his friend finished fumbling with his Adidas, the racewould be over.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
