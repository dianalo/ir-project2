(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker will take the stand Friday todefend himself against fraud and conspiracy charges, his lawyerssaid Thursday after presenting about 50 character witnesses onbehalf of the PTL founder.   ``When it's over I'll talk,'' Bakker said as he got into his carat the end of Thursday's testimony.   Bakker is expected to be the last defense witness.   ``It could have been today, we're going tomorrow,'' defenseattorney George T. Davis said when asked by reporters if Bakkerwould take the stand Friday.   A federal judge refused Thursday to allow the jury to tour theHeritage USA retreat built by the disgraced television evangelist.   ``It would be a waste of time and serve no purpose for the 18people on the jury to go see it,'' U.S. District Court Judge RobertPotter said.   Another Bakker lawyer, Harold Bender, contended that the juryand six alternates would benefit from seeing the Heritage park innearby Fort Mill, S.C. It was closed this week by a bankruptcytrustee.   The judge clashed the day before with defense lawyers over thenumber of witnesses for Bakker. Potter said he generally allowsonly five character witnesses per side. Bender insisted his werenot character witnesses, but satisfied Bakker backers important tohis case.   The defense has presented at least 72 witnesses since it beganits case Sept. 21. More than 50 of the witnesses testified toBakker's character.   Jurors heard Thursday as they have on previous days fromwitnesses who were satisfied with their $1,000 ``LifetimePartnership'' memberships that allowed them three nights a year atthe hotel at Heritage USA.   Prosecutors contend the parterships were oversold and thatBakker used more than $3.7 million of the proceeds to fund hislavish lifestyle.   Lola Penny testified she recently changed her will to leave herentire estate to the Bakkers without consulting her only child.Julie Wright, a real estate agent from Woodgreen Village, Mich.,testified she and her husband bought 30 lifetime partnerships andwere ``very satisfied'' with her $30,000 investment.   Sharon Creech, a school teacher from Rock Hill, S.C., describedher stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as ``the next best thing to being... close to Jesus.''   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after it was revealed thatministry funds were used to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, withwhom Bakker had a sexual tryst in 1980.   Bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 millionin fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   A group women wearing red ribbons saying ``Enough is enough''and representing the International Christian Women Fellowshiphanded out petitions at the courthouse seeking mercy for Bakker.The petitions were addressed to the U.S. attorney general.   ``This man has not been shown any mercy or compassion,''fellowship president Deanna Smith said. The women removed theirribbons when Potter ordered them to do so or leave the courtroom.</TEXT></DOC>
