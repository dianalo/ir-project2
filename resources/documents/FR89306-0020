Background</ITAG>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that approximately 57million metric tons of hazardous waste are produced each year in the UnitedStates.\1\<NOTE/> These wastes must be treated and stored or disposed in amanner that protects the environment from the adverse affects of the variousconstituents of those wastes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, <T3>Everybody's Problem Hazardous Waste </T3>at 1 (1980).  In response to the need to protect the environment from the improper disposalof these hazardous wastes, Congress, over the years, has enacted severalpieces of legislation intended to control the nation's hazardous wasteproblem. Federal laws passed in 1965 \2\<NOTE/> and 1970 \3\<NOTE/> initially addressed solid waste disposal. Several other piecesof legislation have been enacted by Congress that have ultimately led tothe development of this rule and they are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Solid Waste Disposal Act, Pub. L. No. 89-272, 79 Stat99.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Resource Recovery Act, Pub. L. No. 91-512, 84 Stat 1427and Pub. L. 93-14, 87 Stat II. A. The Resource Conservation and RecovervAct of 1976 The first comprehensive, federal effort to deal with the solid waste problemin general, and hazardous waste specifically, came with the passage ofthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) \4\<NOTE/>. The act provides for the development of federal and stateprograms for otherwise unregulated land disposal of waste materials andfor the development of resource recovery programs. It regulates anyoneengaged in the creation, transportation, treatment, and disposal of ``hazardouswastes.'' It also regulates facilities for the disposal of all solid wastesand prohibits the use of open dumps for solid wastes in favor of requiringsanitary landfills.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 42 U.S.C. 6901 <T3>et seq.</T3> There are, however, many hazardous waste disposal sites that were createdprior to the passage of RCRA. These sites are often abandoned and containunknown quantities of unknown wastes. B. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and LiabilityAct of 1980 In response to the need to clean-up and properly reclaim these pre-RCRAsites, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) \5\<NOTE/> commonly known as ``Superfund.'' Superfund established tworelated funds to be used for the immediate removal of hazardous substancesreleased into the environment. Superfund is intended to establish a mechanismof response for the immediate clean-up of hazardous waste contaminationfrom accidental spills and from chronic environmental damage such as isassociated with abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3> The treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes under RCRA and CERCLA createsa significant risk to the safety and health of employees who work in treatmentand disposal operations. Exposure to hazardous wastes through skin contact,skin absorption, and inhalation pose the most significant risks to employees.Employee exposure to these risks occurs when employees respond to hazardoussubstance or waste emergencies, when they work with hazardous wastes duringstorage, treatment and disposal operations or when they participate inthe clean-up of abandoned-waste sites. This risk of exposure and the need for protecting employees exposed tohazardous wastes is addressed in the ``Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986'' (SARA). C. Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 On October 17, 1986, the President signed into law the ``Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986'' (SARA).\6\<NOTE/> As part of SARA, in section 126 of Title I, Congress addressedthe risk of injury to employees by providing that the Secretary of Labor(``Secretary'') issue interim final worker protection regulations within60 days after the date of enactment of SARA that would provide no lessprotection for workers engaged in hazardous waste operations than the protectionscontained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Healthand Safety Requirements for Employees Engaged in Field Activities'' manual(EPA Order 1440.2) dated 1981, and the existing OSHA standards under SubpartC of 29 CFR Part 1926. OSHA published those interim final regulations inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4> on December 19, 1986 (51 FR 45654). A correctionnotice was published on May 4, 1987 (52 FR 16241). With the exception ofa few provisions that had delayed start-up dates, OSHA's interim finalregulations became effective on December 19, 1986 in accordance with section126(e) of SARA, and apply to all regulated workplaces until the final ruledeveloped under sections 126 (a)-(d) becomes effective.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Pub. L. 99-499. Section 126(a) of SARA provides that the Secretary shall `` * * * pursuantto section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, promulgatestandards for the health and safety of employees engaged in hazardous wasteoperations.'' These standards must be promulgated within one year afterthe date of enactment of SARA. This notice completes the development ofthose standards by issuing a final rule based upon the proposed regulationsas indicated in sections 126(a) and 126(b) of SARA. Pursuant to section 126(c) of SARA, the final regulations issued todayare to take effect in one year. Section 126(c) also provides that the finalregulations are to include each of the worker protection provisions listedin section 126(b), unless the Secretary determines that the evidence inthe public record developed during this rulemaking and considered as awhole does not support inclusion of any such provision. A discussion ofthe public record for this rulemaking and the changes made to the proposedregulations issued August 10, 1987 follows. This final rule has been adapted from the language of the proposed rule.Changes have been made to address more fully the provisions which Congressdirected the Agency to cover and the comments made in the public record.OSHA utilized several sources for the proposal. These included the EPAmanual entitled ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engagedin Field Activities'' (1981), the language of OSHA's safety and healthstandards in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 1926 and various documents issuedeither jointly or separately by the EPA, OSHA, the U.S. Coast Guard, andthe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). OSHA specifically used the joint OSHA/EPA/USCG/NIOSH manual entitled,<T3> ``Occupational Safety and Health Guidance Manual for Hazardous WasteSite Activities''</T3> (Preamble Reference 6), as an outline in preparingthe interim rule and the proposed rule. This manual was developed as aresult of the collaborative efforts of professionals representing the fouragencies. These professionals, who are knowledgeable in hazardous wasteoperations, worked with over 100 experts and organizations in the developmentof the criteria contained in this manual. The manual was published in October1985 and is public information. The manual is a guidance document for managersresponsible for occupational safety and health programs at inactive hazardouswaste sites. The manual is intended for use by government officials atall levels and contractors involved in hazardous waste operations. Themanual provides general guidance and is intended to be used as a preliminarybasis for developing a specific health and safety program for hazardouswaste operations. Further, the major subject areas listed in section 126(b)of SARA are nearly identical to the major chapters in the manual. Based upon the extensive public comments and hearing testimony, OSHA hasmodified the proposal. The final rule takes into account the entire record.In addition, the  language of this final rule clarifies some areas of confusionin the interim rule that OSHA has identified during the public commentperiod and since the promulgation of the interim final rule. The finalrule also reorganizes some of the sections to clarify the standard. D. Regulatory History The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) gave theSecretary of Labor 60 days to issue interim final regulations which wouldprovide no less protection for workers employed by contractors and emergencyresponse workers than the protections contained in the Environmental ProtectionAgency Manual (1981) ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engagedin Field Activities'' and existing standards under the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 found in Subpart C of Part 1926 of the Code of FederalRegulations. Those interim final regulations were to take effect upon issuanceand would apply until final regulations became effective (SARA, andSection;126(e)). OSHA issued its interim final regulations on December 19, 1986(51 FR 45654). SARA also instructed the Secretary of Labor to promulgate, within oneyear after the date of the enactment of section 126 of SARA and pursuantto section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, standardsfor the health and safety protection of employees engaged in hazardouswaste operations (SARA, section 126(a)). On August 10, 1987 OSHA issueda Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Public Hearings (52 FR 29620). ThatNotice set forth OSHA's proposed language for its final rule and announcedpublic hearings that would be held to gather further information to aidthe agency in developing its permanent final rule. Informal public hearings on the subject of this rulemaking were scheduledand held to afford interested parties the opportunity to comment on OSHA'sproposals. The hearings were held October 13-16 and 20-21, 1987 in Washington,DC and October 27-28, 1987 in Seattle, Washington. The hearings originallyscheduled for San Francisco, CA in the August 10, 1987 Notice of ProposedRulemaking were rescheduled for Seattle, WA in an October 13, 1987 announcement(52 FR 37973). Testimony from over 40 witnesses was presented at the hearings. Further,over 30 post hearing comments were submitted to the record of this rulemaking.In addition to the public hearings and the testimony received in responseto those hearings, OSHA received over 125 written comments on its proposedlanguage for a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation of the Standard </ITAG>Paragraph (a)_Scope, Application, and Definitions 1. <T3>Scope. </T3>OSHA proposed to define the scope of this final rule inparagraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2). ``<T3>Scope</T3>'' defines the specific worker populations to be coveredby this rule. The scope of this rulemaking has been an issue during the development andpromulgation of the final rule. OSHA requested specific comment on whetherthe proposed rule was appropriate. Eastman Kodak's comment (10-36) states, ``The preamble of the proposedstandard at page 29622 requested `specific comment on whether [OSHA's]interpretation of scope is too broad or too narrow.' The scope of applicabilityof the standard, especially with regard to ongoing operations at hazardouswaste management facilities regulated under RCRA and/or corresponding stateprograms, appears to be appropriate.'' While the language of the final rule is somewhat different from the languageof the proposed rule, the four major areas of scope remain essentiallythe same. These four areas of scope include (1) clean-up operations atuncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites that have been identified forclean-up by a governmental health or environmental agency, (2) routineoperations at hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilitiesor those portions of any facility regulated by 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265,(3) emergency response operations at sites where hazardous substances havebeen or may be released, and (4) corrective actions at RCRA sites. In additionOSHA has clarified that the agency intends to cover voluntary clean-upsat government identified sites. OSHA's proposal addressed the three specific populations of workers atthe above operations. First, it was proposed to regulate those operationswhere employees are engaged in the clean-up of uncontrolled hazardous wastesites. These operations include those hazardous substance response operationsunder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct of 1980 as amended (CERCLA), including initial investigations at CERCLAsites before the presence or absence of hazardous substances has been ascertained,those major corrective actions taken in clean-up operations under the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as amended (RCRA), and those hazardouswaste operations at sites that have been designated for clean-up by stateor local governmental authorities. The second worker population proposed to be covered included those employeesengaged in operations involving hazardous waste treatment, storage, anddisposal (TSD) facilities regulated under 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265 pursuantto RCRA, except for small quantity generators and those employers withless than 90 days accumulation of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR262.34. The third and final worker population proposed to be covered were thoseemployees engaged in emergency response operations for releases or substantialthreats of releases of hazardous substances, and post-emergency responseoperations to such releases at all workplaces. In paragraph (a)(1)(i) of the final rule OSHA is regulating all governmentmandated clean-up operations at uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites.These operations were included in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(iii)of the proposal. For the purposes of this final rule, ``Superfund'' andother uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites include hazardous substanceresponse operations at sites regulated under 40 CFR Part 300, Subpart F;RCRA closure activities conducted under 40 CFR Part 265, Subpart G; andthose similar uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites that have beendesignated for clean-up by Federal, state or local governments. OSHA intends and the change in language clarifies that all government mandatedclean-ups are covered. These include not only sites on the various ``Superfund''lists, but also all other government mandated clean-ups as well. The changedlanguage makes clear that such clean-ups are covered whether or not theyare financed by the government. The language further clarifies that clean-upsmandated by any level of government are covered.In paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is regulating correctiveactions at RCRA facilities. This paragraph adopts the language proposedin paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of the proposal with one change. The term `major'has been deleted as a modifier of ``corrective action.'' Several commentersrequested clarification of the term ``major corrective action.'' InternationalTechnologies, a major hazardous waste clean-up contractor, requested intheir comment (10-44), ``Please clarify `major corrective actions conductedunder RCRA.' What distinguishes `major' corrective actions from other correctiveactions?'' The State of Indiana commented (10-23), ``There is no definitionof what constitutes a `major corrective action' under RCRA.'' In addition,the term ``major'' is not used in EPA terminology. ``Corrective action'' is a term unique to RCRA and has been defined foruse with RCRA. OSHA's addition of the modifier ``major'' raised many definitionalquestions. Therefore OSHA, in the final rule, is deleting the word ``major''to be consistent with EPA terminology and eliminate confusion. Rather thandefine ``major corrective action,'' OSHA is amending the language of theproposal to include a phrase describing the level of corrective actionthat is to be regulated in the scope of this rule. OSHA will be regulatingthose corrective actions that potentially expose employees to a ``safetyor health hazard.'' OSHA is not concerned with those corrective actionsthat are intended to abate environmental risks without exposing employeesto safety or health hazards. The phrase ``safety or health hazard'' inthe introductory language is the phrase that OSHA has used to differentiatethe type of releases that this standard regulates versus those releasethat may pose only environmental threats rather than safety or health threatsto employees. OSHA has decided to add a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to the final rule thatwould include within the scope of this rule those voluntary clean-up operationsconducted at sites recognized by governmental bodies as uncontrolled hazardouswaste disposal sites. All other voluntary clean-ups would be exempt from29 CFR 1910.120. OSHA does not have the statutory responsibility to identifyhazardous waste sites. It will leave to agencies with that authority theresponsibility to identify those sites. Those voluntary sites that arenot recognized by the government as uncontrolled hazardous waste disposalsites would be exempt from 29 CFR 1910.120; however, they would still beregulated by the other OSHA general industry or construction industry standardsapplicable to the work being performed at the site. OSHA did not propose to cover voluntary clean-ups of hazardous substancesin its proposed rule. Many comments suggested this, however, the Agencyhas concluded that individuals involved in voluntary clean-ups may be exposedto the same safety and health risks at voluntary sites identified by thegovernment whether or not the government is compelling action. However,it would be difficult to know whether or not sites not identified by thegovernment are hazardous waste sites without a structured evaluation systemfor such potential sites. OSHA raised an issue on the scope in the preamble to the proposal thatgenerated several comments. On page 29622 of the preamble to the proposal,OSHA listed several TSD facilities that would not be covered by the finalrule. The exemptions were taken from a list published by the U.S. EPA thatare not directly regulated by U.S. EPA. However, the proposed standard'slanguage did not grant these exemptions. Comments did not support the exemptionsand OSHA did not believe that they were appropriate. The particular exemption that generated the most comment exempted thoseTSD facilities which operate under a state hazardous waste program pursuantto RCRA section 3006. These state hazardous waste programs are recognizedby U.S. EPA in a similar fashion to the OSHA state plan states under section18 of the OSH Act. A number of commenters, such as the State of Indiana(10-23), objected to this type of exemption by OSHA as not being appropriate.They stated OSHA jurisdiction should not be impacted by U.S. EPA stateagreements, but only those state agreements provided in the OSH Act. OSHAagrees with these commenters and therefore OSHA jurisdiction will be delegatedto only those states which OSHA has formal agreements with under the OSHAct. However, it should be noted that the U.S. EPA jurisdictions underSARA section 126 may make use of their state agreements. Other commenters, EXXON (10-33) and CONOCO (10-32), suggested that OSHAincorporate the exemptions on page 29622 as a separate paragraph in thefinal rule. Typical TSD facilities range from the hazardous waste generator with ahazardous waste storage area to the large, complex hazardous waste disposalfacility. EPA estimates that approximately 80 percent of all generatorsalso treat, store, or dispose of their hazardous wastes and thereby qualifyas a TSD facility. Over 30,000 TSD facilities notified EPA in 1980 thatthey would qualify for regulation under section 3004 of RCRA. OSHA continues to regulate RCRA TSD facilities in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)of the final rule as it was proposed in the regulatory language of theproposal. The list of exemptions on page 29622 will not be incorporatedinto the final rule. OSHA believes that such a list would create too greata gap in the protection of workers. For example, with respect to workersat TSD facilities operating under a state hazardous waste program pursuantto RCRA section 3006, OSHA agrees with a comment made by the State of Indiana(10-23) that it is possible that the workers in those 42 authorized statesidentified by Indiana could be without the protections mandated by Congress.In paragraph (a)(1)(v) OSHA would continue to regulate emergency responseoperations for releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardoussubstances without regard to the location of the operation as proposedin paragraph (a)(2) of the proposal. Such emergency response operationsare not limited to those responses at uncontrolled hazardous waste disposalsites or RCRA TSD facilities. With respect to transportation incidents,responders to the scene are covered but operators (i.e., truck driversand train crews) are not covered unless they become actively involved inthe response action. OSHA is making major revisions to proposed paragraph (1). These revisionshave been made in response to comments concerning OSHA's involvement inregulating emergency response at every site involving hazardous substancerelease or potential release. Some of the comments were in favor of OSHA'scontinued involvement with emergency response (i.e., American ChemicalSociety, 10-44) and others were opposed to continued involvement (i.e.,ECOLAB, 10-64). Others supported OSHA involvement in emergency responseactivities at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and certain RCRA facilitiesbut opposed the agency's involvement with non-waste clean-up or non-RCRAfacilities (i.e., The Chlorine Institute, 10-24). Yet others called fortwo separate areas in the rule; one for hazardous waste operations, andone for emergency response (i.e., Allied Signal, 10-38). Others opposedcoverage of emergency response to petroleum spills (CONOCO, Ex. 10-32).OSHA after reviewing all the comments, continues to believe that it isthe clear intent of Congress that any employees participating in an emergencyresponse to the release or potential for release of hazardous substancebe covered by this rulemaking. This Congressional intent applies to allsuch emergency responses including those both off and on hazardous wastesites. The statutory language indicates that all emergency responses where thethreat of hazardous substance spills exist are to be covered. Section 126(b)(11) of SARA specifically provides that ``requirements foremergency response'' are to be included and is not limited to hazardouswaste sites. In addition, section 126(d)(4) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Training of Emergency Response Personnel._Such training standardsshall set forth requirements for the training of workers who are responsiblefor responding to <T3>hazardous emergency situations </T3>who may be exposed to toxic substancesin carrying out their responsibilities. (emphasis added)</ITAG>This is very broad language that is not limited to hazardous waste operationsor hazardous wastes or substances on CERCLA or RCRA sites. It covers all``hazardous emergency situations'' for all ``toxic substances'' which wouldclearly cover all types of emergency response for chemical spills includingchemical tanker spills and the like. It should also be noted that oncea tank truck spills a toxic chemical in an emergency it creates a hazardouswaste in the very real sense. Further, the grant provision of the statute clearly indicates that grantscan be made to train workers for emergency response at any location, notjust on hazardous waste sites. Section 126(g)(1) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Grant Purposes._Grants for the training and education of workers whoare or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removalor containment or <T3>emergency response </T3>may be under this section. (emphasis added)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Other statutory sections also indicate the legislative intent to coverall emergency responses where hazardous chemical spills are possible. In addition to the statutory language, the documents cited by Congressas the minimum guides for OSHA to use in developing this rule refer toall emergency responses. The EPA manual and the OSHA construction standardsreferred to in the statute require preparations and planning for emergenciesgenerally, not just for hazardous waste site emergencies. In addition the legislative history indicates that Congress intended Section126 to cover emergency response to all situations where spills of hazardouschemicals were a possibility and not just emergency response on hazardouswaste sites. For example, Senator Hatch stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment will address the concerns that have been raised thatthe Department of Labor issue standards for employees engaged in hazardouswaste operations, as well as emergency response. (9/24/88 Cong. Rec. pg.S-12031)</ITAG>As discussed elsewhere in this preamble OSHA believes there is a clearneed for training and other provisions to protect workers engaged in allemergency responses when there is the possibility of hazardous substancespills. This is needed whether or not the emergency occurs on a hazardouswaste site. The agency believes that the hazards are the same in thesecases. Finally, other parts of SARA, in particular Title III, address emergencyresponse actions and planning by communities and local government employersoutside of the hazardous waste clean-up operation. The Congressional concernson toxic emergencies also discussed in <T3>Task Force on Toxic Emergencies, </T3>Environmental and Energy StudyConference Special Report, September 18, 1986. This report stresses theneed for training of emergency response personnel as well as emergencyresponse planning and related areas. This was part of the legislative researchwhich led to the passage of section 126 of SARA. OSHA's final rule rulemaking divides emergency response into three separateareas. First, OSHA is regulating emergency response by employees at uncontrolledhazardous waste sites in paragraph (l) of the final rule. This paragraphcontains the requirements that were in paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) ofthe proposal and the interim rule. These regulations applied to the ``on-site''operations of the interim rule. Second, OSHA is regulating emergency responseat RCRA facilities in paragraph (p)(8). This paragraph contains the requirementsthat were in paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(3) of the proposal and interim rule.These regulations applied to the ``off-site'' operations of the interimrule. Third, OSHA is regulating emergency response to hazardous substancereleases by employees not covered by paragraphs (l) and (p)(8) in paragraph(q). Paragraph (q) contains the requirements proposed in paragraphs (l)(1),(l)(3), (l)(4), and (l)(5) of the proposal and interim rule. These regulationswere directed toward emergency response teams, industrial fire brigades,and hazardous materials teams. In its proposal OSHA covered emergency response to releases of hazardoussubstances. The agency did not propose to limit emergency response to uncontrolledhazardous waste sites but decided instead to propose to cover all emergencyresponse whether it was done at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites or anywhereelse, including petro-chemical and similar manufacturing facilities. OSHA's decision to propose coverage of all emergency response was basedupon the high risk associated with emergency response by untrained andunprotected employees and the need for proper training and equipment tobe provided for emergency response to hazardous substance releases. Intestimony during the public hearings on this rulemaking, Mr. William Bunnerstated, ``The highest-risk incidents are the persons who respond to spillsand accidental releases of hazardous chemicals; and those personnel, particularlypublic first responders, have had the least protection in terms of chemicalemergency response safety and health plans, training and equipment.'' (Tr.pgs. 24-25). Mr. Bunner goes on to state, ``The real strength of 29 CFR1910.120 is that it not only provides for a more consistent and thoroughapproach to protecting workers involved in hazardous waste operations,but also for personnel who face extremely high risk to life and healththat's associated with chemical emergency response.'' (Tr. pg. 25).Another witness, Mr. Ray Simpson, one of OSHA's expert witnesses on firesuppression, fire inspection, and training, testified, ``I like to supportany concept that advocates properly equipping, training, and supportingemergency responders. When I talk about an emergency responder, I'm nottalking simply about fire fighters although that's basically my expertise.I'm talking about the emergency medical technicians, the people who handlethe victims. I'm talking about the police officer who, many times, is firston the scene before any of us get there: the many who really must make,in some situations, the initial decision about what's going to happen.I have learned over these many years that the two greatest dangers thatface us as emergency responders are ignorance or non-awareness of whatwe're facing and the lack of plan or any procedure that will take us tothe end that we're trying to accomplish.'' (Tr. pgs. 89-90). Margaret Seminario, Associate Director, Department of Occupational Safety,Health and Social Security of the American Federation of Labor-Congressof Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) also testified at OSHA's public hearingson the issue of emergency response. Ms. Seminario discussed the participationof the AFL-CIO in hearings before the House Subcommittee on Employmentand Housing of the Government Operations Committee and the Safety and HealthSubcommittee of Education and Labor. Ms. Seminario stated, ``Those hearingsdealt with the issues of the problems for hazardous waste workers in bothSuperfund operations and RCRA operations, but they also got into an issuethat had really not been explored very fully: the problems facing emergencyresponse workers, particularly for the AFL-CIO firefighters. The membersof our firefighter's union were the ones who were called in when therewere spills, leaks and other accidental releases. These weren't hazardouswaste sites, per se, at the time. They became hazardous waste sites andwere defined as such after the fact; but they were routinely called inwithout information, without adequate protection to deal with these problems.That was an issue, as I said, that was fully explored in those hearingsand it was the reason that, when we moved from those hearings into a legislativeopportunity in Superfund, we looked beyond the language that we had comeup with in the 1980 law which dealt only with hazardous waste and expandedit to include emergency response operations.'' (Tr. pgs. 345-346) Further, OSHA still believes that Congress intended this rule to have suchcoverage. This is indicated by the language of SARA as well as the legislativehistory. As OSHA stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``The language ofsection 126(a) mandates safety and health standards for the protectionof employees engaged ``in hazardous waste operations.'' The term ``hazardouswaste operation'' is not limited in the legislation and a response to spillsof hazardous substances on the highway or from a railway tank car in orderto control and contain the hazardous substance (which has become a wasteonce it is not contained) is in the common sense meaning a hazardous wasteoperation.'' ``This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that SARA is a free-standingstatutory provision and not an amendment to CERCLA. The clear Congressionalintent then is to provide protection to employees whenever they deal withhazardous wastes.'' In addition section 126(d)(4) discussing training for emergency responsepersonnel utilizes the very broad term ``hazardous emergency situation.''Section 126(g)(1) indicates that training grants may be given independentlyfor emergency response training separate from hazardous waste removal training.Section 126(b)(11) also indicates emergency response is an independentconcept separate from hazardous waste removal operation. For those andother reasons OSHA believes section 126 is intended to cover emergencyresponse to hazardous substances whether on an uncontrolled hazardous wastedisposal site, a RCRA site or elsewhere. However, the clarified languagein the scope sections makes it clear the only employers whose employeeshave the reasonable possibility of engaging in emergency response are covered.Emergency response employees who respond or will respond to incidents involvinghazardous substances are covered by this final rule to the extent thatthey are exposed to hazardous substances. State and local government employeesin states that have agreements with OSHA under section 18 of the OSH Actmust be regulated by state regulations at least as effective as these toprotect public employees. Those state regulations must be issued withinsix months of the date of promulgation of this final rule. However, some commenters have commented that OSHA has exceeded the intentof Congress with the scope of the proposed rule. Many of these commentersstated that OSHA's coverage of emergency response at sites other than specificcleanup or TSD facilities was too broad and unwarranted. AMOCO's comment(10-26) is representative of some of the comments made on this issue. Intheir comment AMOCO stated that, ``Section 126(a) of SARA is the directiveto OSHA to promulgate standards `for the health and safety protection ofemployees engaged in hazardous waste operations.' There is no referencewhatsoever in this directive to promulgate standard (sic) with respectto emergency response activities outside of hazardous waste operations.''However, other comments received from the petrochemical industry support,on a limited basis, OSHA's decision to cover emergency response with thescope of the standard. CONOCO's comment (10-32) is representative of thispoint of view. CONOCO states, ``Conoco's primary concern with the proposedrule centers on the extremely broad scope of employee coverage under thisstandard and compared to Congress' intent to cover `hazardous waste operationsand emergency response.' We believe that Congress intended section 126of SARA to cover employees engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergencyresponse to these operations on a full-time basis.'' While this commentwould seem to support OSHA's coverage of employees engaged in emergencyresponse, that support is limited to those employees engaged in responseon a full-time basis at hazardous waste operations. Based upon public testimony and written comments received into the recordof this rulemaking, OSHA has concluded, that because of the high risk associatedwith emergency response to the releases of hazardous substances and thenumber of these incidents occurring, that coverage of workers conductingsuch emergency response activities is both appropriate and necessary. OSHA believes that the scope of this final rule carries out the intentof Congress and is consistent with good occupational safety and healthpolicy. Employees performing clean-up operations under CERCLA, RCRA (correctiveactions) and state or local government designated sites_generally thoseemployees likely to have the highest exposures to hazardous substancesover a longer period_would be covered by virtually all the provisions ofthis final rule. Employees exposed to hazardous wastes in routine RCRAhazardous waste operations, who are regularly exposed to hazardous wastesbut in a more controlled environment, would be covered by the more limitedrequirements of paragraphs (p) and (q). Emergency response workers, exposedusually for short periods to often unknown but possibly high levels ofhazardous substances, would be regulated by paragraph (q).2. <T3>Application. </T3>OSHA proposed to define the application of this finalrule in paragraph (a)(3) of OSHA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)published on August 10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). ``<T3>Application</T3>'' establishes which regulations within this rule applyto the specific worker populations to be protected by this rule. In paragraph (a)(3)(i) OSHA proposed that the employer would have to complywith the standards in 29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926, as well as with the requirementsspecifically covered in the proposed rule. If there were a conflict oroverlap between standards, it was proposed that the more protective provisionswould apply. Since this rule does not cover all of the hazards presentat hazardous waste operations, other OSHA standards in Parts 1910 and 1926should apply to ensure employee safety and health. Other OSHA standardsregulate many other hazards, and OSHA wants to make clear that the otherstandards continue to apply. Also, OSHA proposed that hazardous waste operatorswho are not within the scope of this standard should continue to be regulatedby the Parts 1910 and 1926 standards. OSHA is keeping those provisionsin the final rule for the reasons stated with minor editorial changes forclarification. In paragraph (a)(3)(ii), OSHA proposed that all paragraphs of section 1910.120except paragraph (o) would apply to hazardous wastes operations at CERCLAsites, at major corrective action at RCRA sites, and at sites designatedfor clean-up by state and local governments. Paragraph (o) of the proposaladdressed certain operations conducted under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). OSHA recognizes that the hazards presented to employees engaged in clean-upoperations involving uncontrolled hazardous wastes are far greater thanthose presented to employees engaged in the routine, day-to-day operationsof an EPA licensed TSD facility. OSHA has made two editorial changes in its proposed language in paragraph(a)(3)(ii) without changing the intent of the paragraph. First, ratherthan referring to each of the types of sites individually, OSHA is makingreference to the scope paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) to identifythe sites that this application paragraph addresses. The sites to be addressedremain the same as proposed. Second, because the codification of paragraphshas changed in this final rule due to changes made to the proposal, paragraph(p) of andSection; 1910.120 rather than paragraph (o) will apply specificallyto hazardous waste operations at RCRA sites which are involved in treatment,storage, disposal and handling of hazardous waste. The new requirementsof paragraph (p) are discussed later in the preamble. In paragraph (a)(3)(iii), OSHA proposed that the requirements set forthin paragraph (o) of section 1910.120 would apply specifically to the hazardouswaste operations at RCRA sites which are involved in treatment, storage,disposal and handling of hazardous waste. The proposal contained a limitedexclusion from these regulations for certain small quantity generatorsand less than 90-day accumulators, such as dry cleaners and gas stations,which come within the purview of RCRA, but are not hazardous waste operationsin the normal meaning of the term. The exclusion was available to theseoperations depending upon the employer's decision to provide or not provideemergency response by employees to releases of, or substantial threatsof releases of, hazardous substances. OSHA proposed to exempt small quantity generators and less than 90 dayaccumulators from all parts of the rule if they did not provide emergencyresponse by their employees to releases of, or substantial threats of releasesof, hazardous substances. OSHA further proposed to exempt small quantitygenerators and less than 90 day accumulators from all parts of the ruleexcept paragraph (l) if they did provide emergency response by their employeesto releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances.OSHA recognized that many small quantity generators are smaller businesseswith limited employee populations. Since most of these establishments relyon the emergency response services of local fire and rescue departments,OSHA is providing a complete exemption from these proposed standards whenthe employer can show that employees are not required or encouraged toengage in emergency response, but are directed in the case of emergencyspills of hazardous substances to maintain a safe distance and to calllocal fire or other emergency response organizations. In cases where suchestablishments do provide emergency response by employees, and therebyexpose employees to hazardous substances, OSHA proposed that such employersmeet the emergency response requirements of paragraph (l) of this proposedrule. OSHA concludes its proposal is supported by the record. Without these exemptions, these regulations could be interpreted to covergas stations, dry cleaners, and other small businesses which temporarilystore small quantities of a hazardous waste. These businesses are not engagedin hazardous waste operations as that term is conceived of normally. Inaddition, it is not believed that Congress intended such businesses tobe covered. They do not present the relatively high exposure to a numberof hazardous health risks to employees that hazardous waste sites typicallydo. In paragraph (a)(3)(iv) OSHA proposed that the requirements set forth inparagraph (l) of this section would specifically apply to the work conductedby emergency response personnel when they respond to hazardous substanceemergency incidents. Emergency response personnel include firefighters,EMS personnel, and police as well as other employees. The regulation of employees providing emergency response has been discussedunder the ``Scope'' portion of this preamble discussion. Further discussionof OSHA's changes to the emergency response portion of this rulemakingis contained in the discussion of paragraph (l) of the proposal. OSHA also requested comment on what other operations should be and areintended by Congress to be covered, and whether specific operations shouldbe excluded because of low exposures. For example, municipal or other sanitarylandfills that handle domestic wastes would not normally be regulated bythis rule. Similarly, waste paper or scrap metal operations would not normallybe regulated because of the type of wastes they handle. However, both typesof operations would be regulated if they have clean-ups for or handle hazardouswastes meeting the scope provisions of the standard. Also, employees at hazardous waste disposal sites who will not be exposedto, or do not have the potential to be exposed to, hazardous substancesare not covered by this rule. The provisions of these regulations are designedto protect employees who have or may have exposures, and would not be neededfor those employees who do not. Operations with no exposure to hazardous substances, i.e., road buildingfor site access, construction of or the setting up of temporary facilitiesin the clean zone, or the closure of a RCRA site involving the buildingof a clay cap over hazard wastes, are considered to be construction activitiescovered by the standards in 29 CFR Part 1926.As a result of the comments received during the public comment phase ofthis rulemaking, OSHA has made some changes to the degree of regulationfor emergency response workers. However, the scope of this standard continuesto cover such workers and paragraph (a)(2)(iv) identifies the new paragraphswithin the rule that reflect the changes and identifies the standards thatapply to emergency response operations. 3. <T3>Definitions. </T3>In paragraph (a)(4), <T3>Definitions, </T3>OSHA proposed to identify and define the variousterms used in this rulemaking that may cause confusion. However, the followingnew definitions have been added as a result of comments made in the record:``published exposure level,'' and ``uncontrolled hazardous waste site''.Except for the definition of ``established exposure level'' which has beenamended to define ``published exposure level,'' no definitions have beenremoved from the proposal. The term ``established permissible exposure limit'' was incorporated aspart of the determination of whether medical surveillance was required.There were a number of comments on this definition. One commenter, Four Seasons Industrial Services (10-5), believed that thedefinition should be broadened. Four Seasons stated, ``The routes of chemicalexposure are through inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion. All ofthese have to be considered when dealing with permissible exposure limits.Your definition as written does not include ingestion.'' Other commenterswere concerned that OSHA included the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limitsin the definition of PELs. The E. I. DuPont de Nemours, Co. (10-28) commentssummarize many of those received against the NIOSH levels. DuPont stated,``NIOSH limits have not undergone public review and comment as have nationalconsensus standards and regulatory exposure standards. Therefore, theyshould not be included in the definition of `established exposure limits'.''CONOCO (10-32) agreed when they stated, ``These NIOSH limits are not subjectto peer review or public comment as are OSHA's PELs. We encourage OSHAto remove the references to these NIOSH limits. We strongly urge OSHA to<T3>only </T3>use PELs given in 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z.'' Dr. James Melius, Division of Environment Health Assessment, State of NewYork Department of Health Medical Surveillance, and one of OSHA's expertwitnesses in occupational medicine, stated in his testimony (Tr. pg. 115)that, ``I think it's important that the OSHA standards be supplementedby information from NIOSH and ACGIH, both of which cover a larger numberof chemicals or toxic substances and both of which include, or at leastconsider, more up to date information on the toxicity of these substances.''In addition, during the public hearings, OSHA, through its panel of staffmembers specifically asked Captain Richard A. Lemen, Director of the Divisionof Standards Development and Technology Transfer within NIOSH, about thepeer review process of NIOSH RELs. Mr. Thomas Seymour of OSHA directedthe following question to Captain Lemen (Tr. pg. 195).<ITAG tagnum="21">[Mr. Seymour:] We have received some feedback in our record aboutthe order of the hierarchy that we have used for permissible exposure limits.There have been statements made that the RELs are not peer-reviewed ordeveloped. I wonder if you might describe to us how the RELs have beendeveloped by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</ITAG>Captain Lemen's response (Tr. pgs. 195-197) to Mr. Seymour was:<ITAG tagnum="21">Okay. In response to the peer review question, I would say that probablythe RELs were more peer reviewed than most recommendations. The first processof developing an REL at National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth is to propose such a recommendation be developed to the Directorof NIOSH through a position paper. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">That is then reviewed by senior NIOSH staff. Once that approval isgiven, a criteria manager then develops the recommended exposure standardin the form of a criteria document. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once the criteria document has gone through several layers of reviewwithin NIOSH, it is then sent out for external review. On the average,we usually send out to more than 40 experts in the field that documentfor their external comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We receive those comments back. We incorporate those comments whereappropriate. We then submit the document through the same internal reviewwithin NIOSH. It goes through every division within the Institute and itfinally winds up in the senior review staff at the directors' level atour headquarters in Atlanta. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A meeting is then held with the Director of NIOSH at which time thecriteria manager and the senior scientists within the Institute [review]all of the reviewer_external and internal reviewer_comments and a decisionis made by the Director of NIOSH whether or not to publish a recommendedexposure limit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the decision is to publish, then we do so and submit that criteriadocument to the Director of OSHA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">So it goes through a very extensive peer review process compared to,for example, an article submitted to peer-review journal which is writtenby a researcher and generally sent out to three to five individuals toreview before it's placed in a peer review journal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">So the extensiveness of our review process, I think, is much greaterthan that for a peer-preview journal article.</ITAG>In light of these comments OSHA has concluded that the NIOSH REL's haveundergone the necessary peer review to be included in the standard's hierarchyof limits.The term ``established exposure levels'' was defined in the proposal toindicate the levels which would trigger medical surveillance of the exposedemployees. The term included not only OSHA established PELs, but also exposurelimits suggested by NIOSH and ACGIH. After review of these and other comments,OSHA concludes that it is appropriate to go beyond the OSHA establishedPELs in triggering medical surveillance. First, medical surveillance isappropriate for workers exposed to toxic chemicals other than those coveredby the PEL's. Second, because of the broadly-worded language in section126(b)(3), which requires medical surveillance for workers engaged in hazardouswaste operations ``which would expose them to toxic substances.'' Someof these ``toxic substances'' are not included in the OSHA PELs. When OSHAcompletes its rulemaking on the air contamination proposal (PEL's project),there will be fewer toxic substances not covered by PEL's. But in lightof Congressional language and the large number of hazardous chemicals presentin an uncontrolled hazardous waste site, OSHA concludes that this definitionis appropriate to protect employee safety and health. The term ``permissible exposure limits'' was defined in the proposal asthe inhalation or dermal permissible exposure limit specified in 29 CFRPart 1910, Subpart Z. As a result of the comments received in the record,OSHA has amended its definition that ignored the health limits specifiedin Subpart G, for ``permissible exposure limits.'' OSHA has amended the definition for ``permissible exposure limits'' toinclude a reference to Subpart G of Part 1910. It now includes both SubpartZ health hazards and those requirements in Subpart G of Part 1910. First, OSHA has changed the term ``established exposure levels'' to theterm ``published exposure level'' to reduce confusion. Second, the term``published exposure level'' is defined as the exposure limits publishedin ``NIOSH Recommendations for Occupational Health Standards'' dated 1986,incorporated by reference, or if none is specified, the exposure limitspublished in the standards specified by the American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists in their publication ``Threshold Limit Values andBiological Exposure Indices for 1987-88'' dated 1987, incorporated by reference.Third, the provisions of (f)(2) on medical surveillance have been changedto cover overexposures to both PEL's and, if none, then over-exposure topublished exposure limits. OSHA concludes that with these changes the definitionsare clear, comprehensive and carry out both statutory directives and appropriatemedical criteria in determining whether medical surveillance is required.Some commenters stated a broader guide is necessary for respirator useand that is discussed under paragraph (g). OSHA requested comment on the appropriateness of its definitions of hazardouswaste, health hazard and hazardous substance and whether they were consistentwith EPA and DOT practice. Several comments were received on these issues.One set of comments criticized OSHA's incorporation of petroleum and petroleumproducts in its definition of hazardous substances. A typical comment was made by EXXON (10-33). In their comments EXXON presentedthe following discussion:<ITAG tagnum="21">Perhaps the most fundamental misinterpretation contained in this ruleis the inclusion of petroleum and petroleum products in the definitionof hazardous substance. As discussed in Comment II.A.4.v, below at pages11 to 14 [internal EXXON comment references], Congress, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Transportation (DOT) haveuniformly recognized the inappropriateness of characterizing petroleumas a hazardous substance. There is no indication in SARA Section 126 thatCongress intended to change the petroleum exclusion or to subject petroleumreleases to emergency response regulation.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EXXON further stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is EXXON's understanding that a situation is not an emergency responsesubject to the requirements of paragraph (1) unless there is a releaseof a ``hazardous substance.'' Therefore it is essential that the definitionof ``hazardous substance'' be accurate and correct.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed definition of ``hazardous substance'' references theDepartment of Transportation's definition of ``hazardous materials'' under49 CFR 171.8. By so doing, petroleum and petroleum products have been includedas hazardous substances; and, related spills may be subject to the burdensomerequirements for emergency response operations.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congress, in the very CERCLA sections cited in the proposed definitionof ``hazardous substance,'' has recognized that petroleum and petroleumproducts are excluded from the federal definition of ``hazardous substance.''EPA regulations under CERCLA have incorporated this congressional directive.<T3>See </T3>40 CFR Part 302 and discussion at 50 FR 13456, 13460 (April4, 1985). DOT has specifically recognized this Federal petroleum exclusionand incorporated the exclusion in its definition of ``hazardous substance.''<T3>See </T3>52 FR 24474 (July 1, 1987). As such, the proposed OSHA definitionis inconsistent with the CERCLA, EPA and DOT definitions of ``hazardoussubstance.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed definition of ``hazardous waste'' includes the EPA RCRAdefinition of hazardous waste and the DOT definitions at 49 CFR 171.8.The cited DOT regulation defines both hazardous substances and hazardouswastes. As noted above, the DOT definition of hazardous substance at 49CFR 171.8 should properly be incorporated in the proposed OSHA definitionof hazardous substance. It is not a waste definition. Therefore, the proposeddefinition of hazardous waste should be limited to waste materials; and,the DOT definition of hazardous substance should be clearly excluded.</ITAG>OSHA does not agree with these arguments. Section 126 of SARA is directedto protecting workers from the hazards of all hazardous waste spills. Petroleumproducts create significant health and safety hazards. Many comments supportedOSHA's incorporation of petroleum and petroleum  products.During the questioning of Dr. Kenneth H. Chase, M.D., President of theWashington Occupational Health Associates, Inc., Mr. Chappell Pierce ofthe OSHA panel asked Dr. Chase the following question (Tr. pg. 551):``Doyou feel that medical monitoring for these types of products [petroleumproducts] is appropriate?''Dr. Chase responded,``Petroleum products is just too broad a term for meto answer that in a general way. Certain petroleum derivatives are moretoxic than others. Some have acute toxicity; others subacute toxicity;and others, the concern is more about chronic toxicity that is most difficultto detect.''During the hearings, OSHA asked many of the individuals who testified ifpetroleum and petroleum products should be included in the definition ofhazardous substances.Representative of the responses made to this question was the testimonyof the Prince Georges County Fire Department; the International Associationof Fire Fighters, AFL-CIO; NIOSH; and the Seattle, Washington Fire Department.Mr. Gregory Noll, the Hazardous Materials Coordinator for the Prince George'sCounty Maryland Fire Department, testified on the issue (Tr. pg. 448).Mr. Thomas Seymour of the OSHA panel addressed Mr. Noll by stating: ``Inotice in your testimony, on page 3, that you indicate that at least 50percent of your responses are involved with flammable liquids or gas emergencies.The definition that OSHA is using in this rulemaking for hazardous substancesdealing with and covering flammable liquids and gases you find, then, appropriate?''Mr. Noll responded, ``I think realistically, from the perspective of fireservice, we've been successfully handling flammable liquid and gas emergenciesfor a number of years. Today, with HAZMATs being the buzz word, certainlythose categories of commodities have been thrown into the hazardous materialsfield.``We now regard them in the hazardous materials field from a practicalperspective.''Mr. Thomas Seymour of the OSHA panel asked Mr. Richard Duffy of the InternationalAssociation of Fire Fighters (Tr. pg. 110), ``Mr. Duffy, we have had someprevious commenters who have advocated that petroleum and petroleum productsbe excluded from the scope of the standard.The example that you just gave about the propane tank inside the buildingexploding and killing fire fighters, what is your opinion about whetherwe should exclude petroleum products from this standard?''Mr. Duffy responded: ``I don't know how we would classify them. I wouldobject to that. I mean, I don't know how to better qualify_I could talkto you for days about incidents involving petroleum products. I don't seeany reason to exclude them any more than excluding the oxidizers or anygroup. I mean, you could pick lots of products and ask to exclude them.And I'm sure a lot of the lobbying entities can establish reasons for it.But I can't see any in terms for fire fighters.''Mr. Charles Gordon of the Department of Labor's Office of the Solicitorand a member of the OSHA panel asked Captain Richard A. Lemen, Directorof the Division of Standards Development and Technology Transfer of, NIOSHthe following question (Tr. pg. 200-201): ``In the case of spills of petroleumor petroleum products in either an emergency response situation or as ahazardous waste dump were there are petroleum products as one of the majorcontaminants, is it appropriate for all the provisions of the OSHA standardor the recommendations to apply in those circumstances?''Captain Lemen responded, ``We believe it is appropriate and they shouldapply in those circumstances, as well.''Mr. Seymour also asked Deputy Chief Roger Ramsey of the Seattle Fire Department(Tr. pg. 142): ``I gather from what you have also said that the definitionwe have, including the DOT hazardous material definition for hazardoussubstance and materials is appropriate, and that we should not excludepetroleum products from the coverage of this standard?''Deputy Chief Ramsey responded, ``Absolutely not.'' Many spills and emergency response to these spills involve petroleum products.These spills present both health and safety risks. Training is necessaryto protect employees who respond to petroleum spills as with other spills.In fact, these are usually the same employees. OSHA concludes that it is crucial to cover responses to petroleum spillsas well as all other spills because petroleum products constitute a substantialthreat to employees responding to accidental releases of these substances.Many petroleum products present health hazards as well as fire and explosionhazards. In addition they often contain fractions which present high healthhazards. For example, many contain benezene, a carcinogen to which employeesmay be exposed. Therefore, OSHA is not amending its definition for ``hazardous substance''to include the petroleum exclusion referenced by some of the commenters. The other definitions are discussed in the preamble to the proposal forthis rulemaking. There were no major comments. OSHA concludes that thosedefinitions are appropriate for the reasons stated in the proposal preamble. Paragraph (b)_Safety and Health Program Paragraph (b) of the proposal has been reorganized for clarity as a resultof the public comment. Basic requirements remain the same. Specific changesare discussed below. This paragraph basically requires that a written safetyand health program cover safety and health organization and specific workpractices to assure employee safety and health. OSHA has concluded thatit is crucial for employee safety and health to have a written safety andhealth program that would force the systematic identification of site hazardsand identify employee response to those hazards. The written plan is necessaryto communicate hazards to employees for their awareness and protection.(See preamble discussion at 52 FR 29624.) OSHA received many comments supporting the requirement for a written safetyand health program (i.e, State of Wyoming, 10-9; James T. Dufour, 10-78;International Association of Fire Fighters Local 291, 10-12); other commentershave made suggestions for changes to the proposed language. OSHA concludes that for the reasons stated a written program is necessary.The following discussion covers specific changes. OSHA has included a non-mandatory note at the beginning of new paragraph(b) that explains the acceptability of safety and health programs developedand implemented to meet other Federal, state, or local regulations in meetingthe requirements of this paragraph. Some commenters believed that OSHA'srequirements for a safety and health program were somewhat duplicativeof the contingency plans and emergency response plans required by the E.P.A.for its permit requirements (i.e., Tennessee Valley Authority, 10-43; NationalPaint and Coating Association, 10-72; Johnson Wax, 10-84). OSHA will permitexisting programs that have been designed to meet other government or corporaterequirements. For example, contingency plans developed under 40 CFR 265.50are acceptable in meeting this requirement if they are supplemented withthe provisions established by the OSHA standard. OSHA does not intend torequire the duplication of efforts made to meet other governmental regulations.Therefore, any plan containing all of the elements required for the OSHAplan will be acceptable in meeting this requirement without the need fordeveloping a separate OSHA plan. In paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule OSHA has taken the language proposedin paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the proposal and subdividedit into paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), and (b)(1)(iv).Paragraph (b)(1)(i) contains the first two sentences of the proposal alongwith two new sentences that clarify what the safety and health programshall include. OSHA has included the new sentences and the new note tothis paragraph to provide further guidance to employers who may need assistancein developing their safety and health program. In paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is using the last sentenceand the list of chapters proposed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and subparagraphs(A) through (C). There are no changes made to the language as proposedother than a recodification of the paragraphs. In paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageproposed in paragraph (b)(2). The proposed language has been moved to thisparagraph because it contains a requirement that is of a general nature. In paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (b)(3)(i) with one exception. A new phrase would require theemployer to inform contractors and sub-contractors of the site emergencyresponse procedures in addition to the proposed information. One commenter,CDM Federal Programs Corporation (10-83), suggested revised language tothe proposal that would assure that the contractors and subcontractorsreceived the site specific safety and health plan as well as the safetyand health programs. OSHA agrees with the suggestion of the commenter andthat the new language accomplishes the recommended change suggested byCDM Federal Programs. In paragraph (b)(1)(v) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageof proposed paragraph (b)(3)(ii). In paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of the final rule OSHA is usingthe exact language of paragraphs  (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), and (b)(1)(iv)of the proposal. One commenter, James T. Dufour (10-78), while supportingthe use of safety and health plans as an appropriate communication toolfor identifying site hazards, suggested that OSHA should require a morecomprehensive review and control of the plan to assure its professionalquality. OSHA believes that the language of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) wouldprovide for this type of oversight and control. Therefore, the only changeto paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (b)(1)(iv) is a recodification of theparagraphs.Paragraph (c)_Site Characterization and Analysis. The employer needs to know the hazards faced by employees in order to developand implement effective control measures. Site characterization providesthe information needed to identify site hazards and to select employeeprotection methods. The more accurate, detailed, and comprehensive theinformation available about a site, the more the protective measures canbe tailored to the actual hazards that the employees may encounter. Congressclearly intended that such a requirement be included. Section 126(b)(1)of SARA provides that the proposal include ``requirements for a formalhazard analysis of the site * * *.'' It is important to recognize that site characterization is a continuousprocess. At each phase of site characterization, information is obtainedand evaluated to define the potential hazards of the site. This assessmentis to be used to develop a safety and health plan for the next phase ofwork. In addition to the formal information gathering that takes placeduring the phases of site characterization described above, all site personnelshould be constantly alert for new information about site conditions. In paragraph (c) of the final rule OSHA has used most of the language inparagraph (c) of the proposal. New headnotes have been added to the majorparagraphs to make reading the requirements easier. In paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of the final rule, OSHA has used thelanguage of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of the proposal. The reasonfor the one additional paragraph in the final rule is that OSHA has numberedthe initial unnumbered paragraph in the proposal, and renumbered the rest.This is an editorial change and does not change any of the proposed requirements.In paragraph (c)(5) of the final rule, OSHA is using the language of paragraph(c)(4) of the proposal with one change. Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of the proposalhas been revised as paragraph (c)(5)(ii). The new requirement still requiresthe use of a five minute escape self-contained breathing apparatus, however,its need is now based upon two conditions. In the proposal, all employeeshad to have access to an ESCBA during initial site entry. Two commenters,the State of Wyoming (10-9) and CDM Federal Programs Corporation (10-83),suggested that OSHA revise this requirement to recognize that the use ofESCBAs should be determined by the nature of the health hazards and thenature of the work to be performed. OSHA agrees that all employees whocannot be exposed to site conditions where possible health hazards mayoccur should not be required to carry ESCBAs. Therefore OSHA has amendedits proposal as follows. Two conditions will now limit the employee populationthat must be provided access to ESCBA. They are (1) if positive-pressureself-contained breathing apparatus is not used as part of the entry personalprotective equipment; and (2) if respiratory protection is warranted bythe potential hazards identified during the preliminary site evaluation.Workers in populations where these two conditions are not met need notbe provided with ESCBA. Paragraphs (c)(5)(i), (c)(5)(iii), and (c)(5)(iv) contain the exact languageas proposed in paragraphs (c)(4)(i), (c)(4)(iii), and (c)(4)(iv). In paragraph (c)(6) of the final rule; OSHA is using the language fromparagraph (c)(5) of the proposal with some changes. In paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA has required that directreading instruments be used where available. In the proposal OSHA had requiredonly that appropriate equipment be used. The agency believes that directreading instruments, where they are available for specific chemical hazards,will provide a more expeditious assessment of the hazards when there isnot enough time during a specific work cycle to send samples out to a laboratoryfor analysis. In some situations, employees may be present at a particularjob site for only a brief time. Certain sampling techniques, other thandirect reading instruments, may require a longer time for analysis thanthe employee's actual exposure time on the job. Therefore, OSHA is amendingits proposal by recognizing direct reading instruments as an alternativeto standard testing procedures. OSHA has added the phrase ``appropriatedirect reading test equipment'' in place of ``appropriate equipment.''OSHA has also added a paragraph (c)(6)(iv) that would require that an ongoingair monitoring program be implemented in accordance with paragraph (h)of the final rule after site characterization has determined that the siteis safe for start-up of operations. This is not a new requirement sinceit uses the same language as that proposed in paragraph (c)(8) of the proposal.OSHA has moved the paragraph from its position in the proposal to paragraph(c)(6)(iv) of the final rule because it is related to the subject matterof paragraph (c)(6). OSHA considers this to be an editorial change becausethere is no change in the proposed language. Paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(iii) continue to use the language of proposedparagraphs (c)(5)(i) and (c)(5)(iii). In paragraph (c)(7) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of proposedparagraph (c)(6) with one change. In the note which describes risks tobe considered, OSHA has amended paragraph (a) by changing the languageto reflect the exposure limits and levels to be used in the final rule.Direct reference to Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), Threshold LimitValues (TLVs), or Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) has been deleted anda reference is made to permissible exposure limits and published exposurelevels as defined in the final rule. No substantive change is made sincethose terms incorporate PELs, TLVs, and RELs by definition. Paragraph (d)_Site ControlIn paragraph (d) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(d) of the proposal. Minor editorial changes have been made for claritywithout changing the proposed requirements. The need for requirements forsite control is discussed at 52 FR 29625 in the preamble to our proposal.There were few substantive comments. OSHA concludes that these provisionsare necessary as discussed in the proposal. Paragraph (e)_TrainingThe proposed rule included specific provisions for initial and routinetraining of employees before they would be permitted to engage in hazardouswaste operations that could expose them to safety and health hazards. Section126(b)(2) of SARA requires initial and recurrent training to be includedin the final rule. The intent of the final training provisions is to provideemployees with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform hazardouswaste clean-up operations with minimal risk to their safety and health. The proposed requirements for training in paragraph (e) addressed theneeds of employees who will be working at CERCLA sites, certain RCRA sites,and sites designated or identified for clean-up by state or local governments. The proposed provisions included a minimum of 40 hours of initial instructionoff the site, and a minimum of three days of actual field experience underthe direct supervision of a trained and experienced supervisor, at thetime of job assignment. Congress has specifically imposed these hour andday requirements under section 126(d) of SARA for the proposed final standard.The proposed requirement represented a one-time effort by the employerfor each employee covered by this standard. Employees would not need tobe retrained for 40 hours at each site at which they work. Employees whohad received the required training at one site could use that trainingto meet the proposed requirement at other sites even if it involved a differentemployer, provided the previous training addressed the hazards at the newsite. There are often many hazards at a waste site. The employee must be trainedto recognize the hazards and appropriate work practices to minimize thosehazards. The employee must also be well trained in the use of respiratorsand other forms of personal protective equipment. Without training, thatequipment may not be used effectively and may not provide adequate protection.An extensive training program is necessary to assure that employees canuse personal protective equipment effectively. Managers and supervisors at regulated facilities, who are directly responsiblefor the site's operations, must have the same training as that of siteemployees and additional time for specialized training on managing hazardouswaste operations. Since these managers and supervisors are responsiblefor directing others, it is necessary to enhance their ability to provideguidance and to make informed decisions. Section 126(d)(2) of SARA providesthat there shall be eight hours of additional training for supervisorsand managers. The provisions also proposed that employees be retrained on an annualbasis on relevant matters such as review of health hazards and the useof personal protective equipment. Employees at hazardous waste operationsmay face serious health and safety risks. Reminders are needed of thisand of work practices necessary to avoid hazards. Personal protective equipmentprovides much of this protection. If there is no retraining in the use,care and maintenance of personal protective equipment, such equipment isunlikely to be properly utilized to provide adequate protection. In all areas of training, whether it be for general site employees, supervisorsat the site, or for the use of specific equipment, the level of trainingprovided must be consistent with the worker's job function and responsibilities.Refresher training must be provided to reemphasize the initial trainingand to update employees on any new policies or procedures. Section 126(d)(3) of SARA requires that OSHA provide for certificationthat an employee has received the training required by the standard. Section126(d)(1) provides that OSHA not require training for employees who havealready received equivalent training. The final standard has provisionsto meet this directive. OSHA requested comment as to whether its proposed training requirementswere appropriate for hazardous waste operations. OSHA's proposed trainingrequirements in paragraph (e) were limited to hazardous waste operationsthat involve the clean-up of uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites.Of all the issues raised by OSHA in its proposal, training was one thatreceived a substantial amount of comment. Important comments directed tothe paragraph (e) training requirements follow. Comments addressing thetraining of emergency response workers will be discussed later in thispreamble under the appropriate paragraphs. In paragraph (e)(1) of the final rule OSHA has combined the introductoryparagraph of proposed paragraph (e) with the language proposed in paragraph(e)(5). The introductory paragraph of the proposal has been designatedparagraph (e)(1)(i) and proposed paragraph (e)(5) has been designated (e)(1)(ii).OSHA considers this an editorial change which groups two general requirementsunder a single paragraph titled ``General.'' In paragraph (e)(2) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(e)(1) in the proposal. Some minor changes are made to reflect the renumberingof the paragraph without changing any of the proposed requirements. In paragraph (e)(3) of the final rule OSHA is revising the proposed languageof paragraph (e)(2) of the proposal. Several comments addressed the proposed40-hour training requirement for all employees who work on hazardous wastesites (i.e., Wassau Insurance Company, 10-8; International Technologies,10-44; Cooperweld Steel, 10-41; James T. Dufour, 10-78). Some of the commentersbelieved that 40 hours of training for some employees at this type of sitewas excessive. For example, it was argued that 40 hours of training wasexcessive for general laborers who may be installing perimeter fencingaround an unopened site and who are not exposed to any hazards. This typeof employee normally will not be wearing the type of protective equipmentor be performing the type of tasks normally associated with removal ofhazardous wastes. On the other hand, employees who will be ``digging inthe dirt'' after the site has been opened in order to remove hazardouswaste may need additional training because of the types of equipment theywill be using and the types of hazards to which they will be exposed.Wassau Insurance commented, ``I feel the 40 hour minimum training requirementis excessive for many employees who will never be required to work abovelevel D protection.'' The commenter continues, ``The excessive trainingrequirements of the current proposal add a significant burden to employersin situations where only low levels of protection are required (e.g., levelD and level C situations).''OSHA has revised its proposal for 40 hours of training for all employeesengaged in hazardous waste operations at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.For general site workers, OSHA is retaining the 40-hour, three-day on-the-jobtraining requirement. OSHA has concluded that this level of training isnecessary to protect general site workers because they are engaged in difficultwork in areas with safety and health hazards. Moreover, OSHA believes theCongressional language is quite clear on this matter.However, for certain types of other workers, OSHA has concluded that lesstraining may be appropriate. For example, those workers who visit sitesonly on occasion and then under the supervision of experienced site workersare required to have 24 hours of training and one-day of on-the-job training.OSHA has also concluded that this same level of training would be appropriatefor those general site workers who work in areas which have been monitoredand fully characterized indicating that exposures are under both permissibleexposure limits and published exposure limits and that respirators arenot necessary.In paragraph (e)(4) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (e)(3).In paragraph (e)(5) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (e)(4) with the addition of a new sentence. Some commentersthought that the proposed language for the qualification of trainers wastoo broad and ambiguous. The State of Indiana (10-23) offered a representativecomment: ``Knowledge or training equivalent to (redundant phrase removed)a level of training higher than the level that they are presenting is noassurance that an employee is capable of providing adequate training toother employees.''Another commenter, the International Union of Operating Engineers (10-58),stated, ``We believe it irresponsible to summarily state that trainersmust be `qualified,' without defining the term other than to suggest thatone who knows more than the person he trains may be a qualified trainer.''Subsequent to the receipt of post-hearing briefs, Congress amended section 126(d) of SARA to require the Secretary of Labor to develop requirementsfor the certification of training programs offered to employees and employerswho must meet the training requirements of this standard. OSHA will soonbe publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to carry out this Congressionaldirection. The requirements of that rulemaking will expand on the provisionsstated in this rulemaking.In order to provide interim guidance to employees and employers in determiningthe competency of trainers and their qualifications, OSHA has added twosentences to the proposed language. These sentences require the use anddemonstration of training, credentials and experience to show competencyas a trainer.In paragraph (e)(6) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of proposedparagraph (e)(6) with one minor change. In addition to permitting certificationto be given by the classroom instructor, OSHA will also recognize certificationsgiven by the head or supervisory instructor of the training facility. Thischange recognizes the fact that some training certificates are signed bythe head instructor upon recommendation of the classroom instructor, ratherthan by the individual classroom instructor.In paragraph (e)(7) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageof proposed paragraph (e)(7).In paragraph (e)(8) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of proposedparagraph (e)(8) with the addition of an example of the type of refreshertraining that OSHA would consider acceptable. OSHA considers, and has nowsuggested, that critiques of prior emergency response performance can serveas a means of refresher training. Critiques of performance during an emergencyresponse can give employees a training experience in which they have actualknowledge of the acceptable or nonacceptable actions taken during the response.Such critiques can also provide employees with the experience they mayneed to perform in a more appropriate manner during their next response.The proposed requirement for annual refresher training has not been changed.In paragraph (e)(9) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageof paragraph (e)(9) in the proposal.Paragraph (f)_Medical SurveillanceThe proposed rule included specific provisions for baseline, periodic andtermination medical examinations. Section 126(b)(3) of SARA provides thatthis rule include requirements for medical examinations of workers engagedin hazardous waste operations. In addition, the EPA manual referred toin section 126(e) of SARA has more detailed requirements for initial orbaseline, periodic and termination medical examinations. The clear Congressionaldirection is to provide a comprehensive medical surveillance program foremployees engaged in hazardous waste operations where it is medically prudent.In paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) OSHA is making some changes for clarity.In addition, OSHA is using the new term ``permissible exposure limits orpublished exposure levels'' instead of the term ``established exposurelevels.'' The reasoning for this change has been discussed under the paragraphof this preamble addressing definitions.OSHA would like to clarify an issue concerning who is covered by medicalsurveillance under paragraph (f)(2) that has cause confusion since thepromulgation of the interim final rule. After reviewing the record of commentsaddressing medical surveillance, it seems that several commenters, in particularfrom the fire service (i.e., 10-1, 10-3, 10-4, 10-12, 10-32 10-79), believethat all firefighters must have the medical surveillance protections ofparagraph (f) since they may wear respirators 30 days or more a year. Firefightersresponding to structural fires will typically wear self-contained breathingapparatus when they enter burning structures or other hazardous locationsand they may make such responses 30 days or more a year. OSHA is not requiringall firefighters who wear respirators 30 days or more a year to have medicalsurveillance. Paragraph (f) applies only to individuals within the scopeof paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) as set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(ii).Typical firefighters from local fire departments do not fall within thisscope. These firefighters are normally covered by the requirements of paragraph(q) as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv). Paragraph (q) does not containrequirements for medical surveillance of firefighters unless they are membersof an organized and designated hazardous materials response team, are hazardousmaterials specialists, or have been injured due to an overexposure to healthhazards during an emergency incident involving hazardous substances asestablished in paragraphs (e)(9) (i) and (ii) of the final rule. In paragraph (f)(3) of the final OSHA is using the language proposed inparagraph (f)(2) with some changes. In new paragraph (f)(3)(i)(B), OSHAis adding the phrase ``unless the attending physician believes a longerinterval is appropriate'' to the proposed language of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B).Several commenters (State of Wyoming, 10-9; American Society of SafetyEngineers, 10-29; Union Carbide Corporation, 10-56) suggested that an annualmedical examination may be excessive for some employees, particularly whenan attending physician can make a recommendation for a less frequent schedule.The American Society of Safety Engineers (10-29) stated, ``This reviewerconcurs in the approach that OSHA has outlined in this comment area thatthe practical health benefit of annual medical examination for hazardouswaste operation workers is indeed uncertain. This is a broad area thatrequires input from the attending physician, the employee and the employer.It is recommended that annual medical examination <T3>not</T3> be required rigidly, that this be a flexible time frequency.''Wyoming (10-9) stated, ``Periodic occupational health physical examinationon an annual basis may not be warranted under all conditions.'' They goon to state, ``It seems reasonable that a good occupational health programrequiring physical examination would be based upon documented personalexposure levels and a medical physician's recommendation rather than onan arbitrary administrative decision to require personnel to undergo annualperiodic physicals if they fit into the categories under andSection; 1910.120(f)(1)(i) and (f)(1)(ii).'' Union Carbide (10-56) said, ``The frequency of medical examinations andconsultations in this proposed rule has been redefined and the proposedchange clarifies the issue of medical surveillance but retains the annualrequirement for `all employees who wear a respirator * * *.' This frequencyof examination is arbitrary. There is not medically-supportable rationalfor this annual requirement.'' There were also comments in support of OSHA's annual physical examinationrequirement. The Occupational Health Nurses (10-30) stated, ``AAOHN supportspre-exposure, annual, and exit examinations with provision of additionalexams if over-exposure or signs or symptoms develop.'' Lockheed (10-45)responded to OSHA's question on whether examinations should be performedyearly, or at other intervals by stating, ``Medical exams should be performedat least yearly.'' GSX Chemical Services, Inc. (10-63) stated, ``(12) Paragraph (f) describesmedical surveillance requirements. The general program described by OSHAfor pre-employment, annual, post-exposure, and termination medical examinationsis excellent.'' BP America, Inc. (10-85) stated, ``The need for medical surveillance ofworkers who would be covered under the provisions of the proposed regulationis appropriate and is supported.'' They further state, ``The proposed requirementto examine workers exposed in emergency situations, but not continue periodicsurveillance simply because of the single episode, <T3>per se, </T3>is logical, and is strongly supported. Having such employeescontinue under periodic medical surveillance on the basis of the findingsof the medical examination is, of course, appropriate.'' Because of variations in employee exposures due to work schedules, annualphysicals may not be medically necessary. OSHA concludes that annual medicalexaminations may not always be appropriate. Accordingly the standard isamended to permit the physician to reduce the frequency to not less thanbi-annually if the physician believes it is appropriate. The physicianmay also increase the frequency if it is medically appropriate. OSHA has also replaced the term ``established exposure limits'' with thephrase ``permissible exposure limits or published exposure levels'' innew paragraph (f)(3)(i)(D) since the terms have been redefined as previouslyexplained. The rest of the language in new paragraph (f)(3) remains as it was proposedin paragraph (f)(2). In paragraph (f)(4)(i) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageproposed in paragraph (f)(3)(i). In paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of the final OSHA is using the language of proposedparagraph (f)(3)(ii) with one change. OSHA is still requiring that thecontent of medical examination and consultations be determined by the attendingphysician. However, OSHA has added language that would direct the employee,employer, and physician to Appendix D for guidelines in developing theexamination. Several commenters requested guidance on the content of the medical examinationsrequired by the proposal. The Okolona Fire District (10-1) commented, ``As,written the current document is rather vague.'' They continued, ``. . .the document should give guidance on what the physical examination shouldentail.'' The American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (10-30),suggested, ``At least minimum content of the physical examination shouldbe specified. An ``exam'' may be no more than visual inspection of an individual'seyes, ears and throat and have no relevance to the exposure situation.'' Other commenters supported OSHA's proposal for the employer and the physicianto determine examination protocols. Eastman Kodak (10-38) commented, ``Wesupport OSHA's position that the physician is best able to determine anappropriate medical surveillance protocol. As noted by OSHA, employeesmay be exposed to differing substances and may be required to use differinglevels of personal protective equipment, such as respirators. In view ofthe particular circumstances presented, the physician is in the best positionto formulate and follow an appropriate medical protocol. OSHA should notinclude a detailed protocol for medical surveillance.'' Lockheed (10-45)responded to OSHA's issue on protocols, ``No. As with training, differencesin amounts, kinds and combinations of exposures in different working situationsrequire that protocol for medical surveillance be left to the discretionof the attending physician.'' Dr. James Melius testified, ``I'd like to direct most of my testimonyto discussions of medical surveillance programs for hazardous waste andemergency response workers. I'd like to begin be saying that programs forboth of these sets of workers are extremely important.'' (Tr. pg. 107)He goes on to say, ``The medical surveillance program for the workers,therefore, should start with initially assessing their ability to workat the site and their capability for conducting that work. It should includean assessment that focuses through a medical history and initial physicalexamination on their cardiovascular and respiratory system, also lookingfor signs of other major medical problems. Selective testing may also beuseful in these instance, including pulmonary function testing, chest x-raysand electrocardiograms. However, the workers may differ in their benefitsfrom this testing depending on their age and other risk factors.'' (Tr.pgs. 110-111) OSHA believes both sides of the argument can be addressed by placing recommendedcriteria for medical examination protocols in the Appendix to this section.Some commenters have suggested protocols that OSHA considered for placementin the Appendix. The St. Petersburg Fire Department (10-4) suggested, ``Afull physical examination: height, weight, eyesight, pulse, blood pressure,respiratory, skin examination, neurological examination, heart and lungs,medical history, and any other aspects determined by the physician. Alsoincluded are: Pulmonary function test, chest X-ray, urine analysis, SMA18 blood test, and hearing examination.'' The chapter on medical surveillancefound in the OSHA/NIOSH/EPA/Coast Guard manual in Appendix F also providesguidance. OSHA also believes that the language of Appendix F will provideguidance for developing the examination protocol. In paragraph (f)(5) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(f)(4) in the proposal with one change. OSHA has added a recommendationthat a physician licensed in occupational medicine be used to superviseor administer the examination. Several commenters suggested that the useof such a physician would assure a more complete occupation-oriented examinationthan one offered by a physician licensed in another field. Representative of these comments was the suggestion of the American Associationof Occupational Health Nurses (10-30). The AAOHN (10-30) stated, ``Thenature of the potential exposures in hazardous waste operations requiresspecialized knowledge in toxicology_knowledge of signs and symptoms andeffects of exposure to various substances_not common in basic health professionalcurricula. This is information that both occupational health nurses andphysicians may have via advance education degrees or continuing education,certification and experience.'' The AAOHN recommended that OSHA changeits proposed language to require the examination to be performed ``by aregistered professional nurse or licensed physician with training and expertisein evaluating exposures to hazardous substances.'' In recognition of AAOHN's comments, OSHA has added the recommendationfor the use of a physician from the field of occupational health. The languageof the final rule, while it does not preclude the use of occupational nurses,does not specifically call for the use of an occupational nurse. The finallanguage requires that the examination be conducted under the supervisionof a licensed physician and that would certainly allow the use of occupationalnurses if the attending physician permits. In paragraphs (f)(6), (f)(7) and (f)(8) of the final rule OSHA is usingthe exact language proposed in paragraphs (f)(5), (f)(6) and (f)(7) Paragraph (g)_Engineering controls, work practices, and personal protectiveequipment for employee protectionOSHA is using the same opening paragraph for paragraph (g) that was inthe opening paragraph for paragraph (g) in the proposal.In paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the final rule OSHA is using the language ofparagraph (g)(1)(i) of the proposal.In paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of the final rule OSHA is usingthe exact language of paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of the proposal,except that the reference to Subpart G is deleted. A new paragraph (g)(1)(iv)is added to cross reference the requirements of Subpart G for clarity.In paragraph (g)(2) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (g)(2) with some editorial modifications.In paragraphs (g)(3), (g)(4) and (g)(5) of the final rule OSHA is usingthe language of paragraphs (g)(3), (g)(4) and (g)(5) in the proposal withminor editorial corrections to be consistent with the terms and languageof the final rule.Paragraph (h)_MonitoringIn paragraph (h)(1) of the final rule OSHA has combined the proposed languagein the opening paragraph and paragraph (h)(1) of the proposal with a clarification.The new paragraphs are designated (h)(1)(i) and (h)(1)(ii). In paragraph (h)(1)(i), OSHA has modified its proposed language by addingthe phrase, ``where it is not obvious that an exposure does or does notexist.'' OSHA is adding this phrase to clarify that monitoring is not necessarywhere the site environment or safety precautions taken by the employerprevent employee exposure to hazardous levels of chemical exposure. OSHAis only requiring monitoring where there may be a question as to an employee'sexposure. When there is a question then the employer should monitor. Wherethere is no question of exposure, then monitoring is not necessary. Forexample, if it is obvious through site characterization and analysis thatthere are no exposures at the worksite, monitoring need not be performedunless worksite conditions or work practices change to the extent thatworkers could be potentially exposed to hazardous concentrations of chemicalexposure. If an employer decides that employees should wear level B protectionin an area where exposure will most probably be below the PEL's, then duringinitial entry monitoring will not be necessary because the employees aremore than adequately protected.In paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) of the final rule, OSHA is using the languageproposed in paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) except for two changes. First,OSHA is adding language to clarify that monitoring should be used to determineexposure above permissible exposure limits which are not immediately dangerousto life or health. Second, OSHA is deleting proposed subparagraph (h)(3)(v)because it is too general in nature and the previous four subparagraphsadequately cover the hazard.In paragraph (h)(4) OSHA is using the exact language proposed in paragraph(h)(4) with one addition. If employees with the highest exposure are overexposed,then representative samples of other employees who may be overexposed mustbe taken to determine if controls or PPE are needed.Paragraph (i)_Informational programsIn paragraph (i) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(i) of the proposal. Minor editorial changes have been made for claritywithout changing the proposed requirements. The need for requirements forinformational programs is discussed at 52 FR 29628 in the preamble to ourproposal. There were few substantive comments. OSHA concludes that theseprovisions are necessary as discussed in the proposal.Paragraph (j)_Handling drums and containersIn paragraph (j) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (j). Minor editorial changes have been made for clarity withoutchanging the proposed requirements. The need for requirements for handlingdrums and containers is discussed at 52 FR 29629 in the preamble to ourproposal. There were few substantive comments. OSHA concludes that theseprovisions are necessary as discussed in the proposal.Paragraph (k)_DecontaminationIn paragraph (k) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(k) in the proposal. However, the agency has reorganized the paragraphand provided headnotes to make the reading of the paragraph easier. Theneed for requirements for decontamination is discussed at 52 FR 29629 inthe preamble to our proposal. There were few substantive comments. OSHAconcludes that these provisions are necessary as discussed in the proposal.Paragraph (l)_Emergency response by employees at uncontrolled hazardouswaste sitesIn paragraph (l)(1) OSHA is using the exact language from proposed paragraph(l)(1)(i).In paragraphs (l)(2)((i) through (l)(2)(xi) OSHA is using the exact textfrom paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (l)(1)(ii)(K).In paragraph (l)(3) OSHA is using the language of proposed paragraph (l)(2)(i)(A)with some modification. The modifications are considered editorial andare made because of OSHA's reorganization of the overall proposed paragraph(l). In paragraph (l)(3) OSHA will require that employees performing emergencyresponse at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites be trained in accordancewith paragraph (e) of this section. This requirement is the same as proposedin the first part of proposed paragraph (l)(2)(i)(A). The portion of proposedparagraph (l)(2)(i)(A) that addresses training at RCRA sites is moved tothe discussion of training in paragraph (p) of this rulemaking becauseof OSHA's reorganization of this paragraph.The language proposed in paragraph (l)(2)(i)(B) has been moved to paragraph(e)(9) of this final rule. This move is considered editorial since it doesnot change any duties imposed on the employer, it only reflects the reorganizationof proposed paragraph (l).In paragraphs (l)(4)(i) through (l)(4)(vii) OSHA is using the exact languagefrom paragraphs (l)(2)(ii)(A) through (l)(2)(ii)(G).In summary, paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of the final rule use thelanguage of paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of the proposal with some modificationsdue to the reorganization of the emergency response requirements of theproposal.Paragraph (m)_IlluminationIn paragraph (m) and Table H-120.2 of the final rule OSHA is using thelanguage of paragraph (m) and Table H-102.1 of the proposal with one minorchange. OSHA has combined the language of the opening paragraph and paragraph(m)(1) of the proposal into one paragraph designated paragraph (m). Minoreditorial changes have been made for clarity without changing the proposedrequirements. OSHA has combined the language of the opening paragraph andparagraph (m)(1) of the proposal into one paragraph designated paragraph(m). The need for requirements for illumination is discussed at 52 FR 29631in the preamble to our proposal. There were few substantive comments. OSHAconcludes that these provisions are necessary as discussed in the proposal.Paragraph (n)_Sanitation at temporary workplacesIn paragraph (n) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(n) in the proposal with some minor editorial changes. The opening paragraphof proposed paragraph (n) has been deleted because it is not a requirement,and Table H-102.2 has been renumbered Table H-102.3. Minor editorial changeshave been made for clarity without changing the proposed requirements.The need for requirements for illumination is discussed at 52 FR 29631in the preamble to our proposal. There were few substantive comments. OSHAconcludes that these provisions are necessary as discussed in the proposal.Paragraph (o)_New technology programs In paragraph (o) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of proposedparagraph (p). This change is necessary due to the reorganization of theemergency response requirements and the moving of proposed paragraph (o),<T3>Certain Operations Conducted Under the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct of 1976 (RCRA).</T3> Proposed paragraph (o) has been moved to paragraph(p) of the final rule.In paragraph (o)(1) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languagethat was proposed in paragraph (p)(1). In paragraph (o)(2) of the final rule OSHA has used the language of paragraph(p)(2) with some changes. OSHA has revised the paragraph to include someadditional examples of  acceptable means of suppression. The agency hasalso added additional information to provide guidance to the employer inmaking evaluations of products and new technologies. These changes areconsidered to be editorial since the requirement of the proposal has notchanged. Paragraph (p)_Certain operations conducted under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) In paragraph (p) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (o) with some changes. OSHA has revised the opening paragraph of the proposal to include largequantity generators of hazardous waste that store those wastes less than90 days within the scope of this paragraph. In paragraphs (p)(1), (p)(2), (p)(3), and (p)(4) of the final rule OSHAhas used the proposed language of paragraphs (o)(1), (o)(2), (o)(3), and(o)(4) with some minor editorial changes. The proposed requirements foreach individual paragraph remain the same. OSHA is adding two new paragraphs, (p)(5) and (p)(6), to address new technologyprograms and material handling programs respectively. In paragraph (p)(5)OSHA requires the employee to develop and implement procedures for usingnew technologies and equipment. Congress, in the SARA legislation, directedOSHA to address new technology programs in its rule. The language of theproposal limited new technology programs to uncontrolled hazardous wastesites. OSHA is adding this paragraph to complete Congress's directive andto address these programs at RCRA TSD facilities. In paragraph (p)(6) OSHA is requiring employers to develop and implementa material handling program for the same reasons as stated above. In paragraph (p)(7) OSHA is using the language from paragraph (o)(5) ofthe proposal with some changes. In paragraph (p)(7)(i) OSHA is using thelanguage of paragraph (o)(5)(i) with one change. OSHA has moved a requirementto paragraph (p)(7)(i) from the last sentence of proposed paragraph (o)(5)(ii)that requires employers to provide employees with a certificate indicatingthat they have successfully completed the training required in the paragraph.OSHA believes that the issuance of this certificate will make it easierfor employers to determine if new employees have completed the necessarytraining and are ready for employment. In paragraph (p)(7)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is using the language fromparagraph (o)(5)(ii) of the proposal with two exceptions. First, the lastsentence of proposed paragraph (o)(5)(ii) has been moved to paragraph (p)(7)(i)of the final rule as discussed above. Second, the requirement for eighthours of annual refresher training is added to this paragraph. OSHA hasadded this requirement to this paragraph because the new format of thefinal rule now addresses training for new employees and current employeesseparately. In the proposal there was no distinction between the two groupsof employees. In paragraph (p)(7)(iii) OSHA has added a new paragraph addressing thetraining of trainers who will be providing the required training to employees.OSHA received many comments on trainers' qualifications. The proposed languagefor RCRA facilities did not address these qualifications. Therefore OSHAis now requiring that trainers be properly trained and qualified to conductthe type of training that they are expected to provide. In paragraph (p)(8) of the final OSHA is addressing emergency responseat RCRA facilities. Paragraph (p)(8) addresses the subject matter proposedin paragraph (1) of the proposal as that paragraph applied to RCRA TSDfacilities. Most of the language used in this paragraph has been takenfrom proposed paragraphs (l)(1). In paragraph (p)(8)(i) of the final rule OSHA has used some of the languagefrom paragraph (l)(1)(i) of the proposal. The basic requirement for thedevelopment and implementation of a written emergency action plan thataddresses site procedures for handling emergency response is the same inthe final rule as it was in the proposal. OSHA will still permit an exemptionfrom this paragraph if the employer totally evacuates the facility at thetime of the emergency and has an emergency action plan meeting the requirementsof 29 CFR 1910.38(a). OSHA considers the changes made in this paragraphto be editorial since the proposed obligations of the employer remain thesame. In paragraph (p)(8)(ii) of the final rule OSHA has used the language ofproposed paragraph (l)(1)(ii). This paragraph contains the minimum elementsthat must be addressed in the employers emergency response plan. The basicelements of the required plan remain the same as proposed. As stated before, training and certification of training were among themany issues discussed during the rulemaking for this final rule. Severalcommenters indicated that there was a need for more specific training criteriafor the courses to be offered and the quality of the instructors presentingthe courses. In light of those comments, OSHA has added a new paragraph(p)(8)(iii) that addresses emergency response training on RCRA TSD facilities.The language that is used in the final rule was developed from that suggestedin the comments made to the record of this proceeding. Basically OSHA is requiring that all employees who are expected to performemergency response at RCRA TSD facilities be trained in how to safely performemergency response duties prior to being called upon to perform those duties[See paragraph (p)(8)(iii)(A).] Examples of the types of training to beprovided have been given. Exemptions are provided in Exception andplusmin;1and Exception andplusmin;2 when employee exposure is reduced through pre-emergencyplanning that includes development of employee awareness of hazards. OSHAis also requiring that employees who have attended and successfully completedthe training that is required in paragraph (p)(8) be certified as havingdone so. Employers would also have to certify the continued competencyof employees on an annual basis [See paragraph (p)(8)(iii)(C)]. In paragraph (p)(8)(iv) of the final rule OSHA is addressing the proceduresto be used for handling emergency incidents. The language in the finalrule has been taken from paragraph (1)(2)(ii) and the requirements remainthe same as proposed. Paragraph (g)_Emergency response to hazardous substance releases not previouslycovered In paragraph (q) OSHA is covering those emergency response situationsthat occur at locations other than uncontrolled hazardous waste sites andRCRA TSD facilities. The typical site covered by this paragraph would bea transportation accident where hazardous substances are or have the potentialfor leaking into the environment. Other sites covered by this paragraphwould include hazardous substance releases at chemical manufacturing facilitiessuch as the release that occurred at the Union Carbide plants in Buphol,India, and Institute, WV.A typical scenario where this paragraph would be applicable would be theemergency response to a derailed tank car containing a hazardous substancethat has begun to leak its contents into the atmosphere. The emergencyresponse to this type of accident would usually include the first responders(i.e., witnesses, police, employees on the train), the first dispatched-responsers(i.e., the first due rescue and fire apparatus), any multiple alarm dispatches(i.e., additional fire and rescue apparatus, HAZMAT teams, state fire marshal,Coast Guard or Federal E.P.A. national response teams), and the clean-upcrew (i.e., initial response employees of the site owner who clean-up therelease). Employees of outside clean-up contractors would be covered byparagraphs (b) through (p). As the clean-up scenario proceeds towards completion, the various employeeson the scene will need different levels of training and protective equipmentrequired in this paragraph. In paragraph (q)(1) of the final rule OSHA is using the language takenfrom paragraph (l)(1)(i) with some minor editorial changes. OSHA wantsto emphasize that employers who will evacuate their employees from theworkplace when an emergency occurs and who do not permit any of their employeesto assist in handling the emergency are exempt from the requirements ofthis paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan in accordance withandSection; 1910.38(a). In paragraph (q)(2) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageof paragraph (l)(1)(ii). In paragraph (q)(3) of the final rule OSHA is using the language proposedin paragraph (l)(3)(ii) with the following changes. In paragraph (q)(3)(i)OSHA has used the language proposed in paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) with somechange. OSHA has deleted the requirement that the senior official respondingto an hazardous substance emergency establish the Incident Command System(ICS). As a result of other requirements in this final rule, the IncidentCommand System should already be established prior to an emergency. Thesenior official responding to an incident scene should only need to takecharge of the incident and begin to implement the preplanned ICS. In paragraph (q)(3)(iv) OSHA has used the proposed language of paragraph(l)(3)(ii)(D) with a change. The proposed language required all employeesengaged in emergency response and exposed to hazardous substances in anyway to wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus whileengaged in emergency response. The final rule will require only those employeesengaged in emergency response and exposed to hazardous substances ``presentingan inhalation hazard or potential inhalation hazard'' to wear positivepressure self-contained breathing apparatus. OSHA has made this changesince several comments suggested that some individuals engaged in emergencyresponse may be exposed to hazardous substances that do not pose an inhalationhazard and, therefore, would negate the need for respiratory protection.Such protection would become a burden to those employees engaged in operationsnot requiring the use of such equipment. In paragraph (q)(3)(vi) of the final rule OSHA has used the language ofparagraph (l)(3)(ii)(F) with the following change. In the proposal OSHAcalled for ``qualified basic life support'' personnel to be present atthe site. In some emergency medical service (EMS) systems the term ``basic-lifesupport (BLS)'' identifies a unique group of trained individuals who havereceived an established level of specialized training. Typically emergencymedical response begins at the first-responder level, and progresses throughbasic-first aid and basic-life support to advanced-life support (ALS).The amount of training and expertise increases as individuals progressthrough the system. As a result of several comments, OSHA has decided toreduce the level of training required for a minimum stand-by capabilityat a hazardous waste sites. Employees trained and qualified in basic firstaid have the basic skills such as initial patient assessment, maintenanceof airway, control of bleeding, immobilization of fractures, and possiblycardiopulmonary resucitation (CPR) to control injuries until a higher levelresponder arrives. If response time for BLS or ALS is long enough thatit is necessary for this level of training to be at the site in case ofan emergency, this rule does not prohibit the stationing of this levelat the site. However, OSHA believes that if BLS or ALS service is availablewithin a reasonable time, a qualified basic first aider can provide thenecessary interim care. The rest of the language in paragraph (q)(3) contains the language thatwas proposed in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) without change. In paragraph (q)(4) of the final rule OSHA has used the language from paragraph(l)(3)(i)(C) with some minor editorial changes to reflect the changes madeto other paragraphs in this rule. The basic requirement for the use andtraining of skilled support personnel remains the same as it was proposed.In paragraph (q)(5) of the final rule OSHA has used the language from paragraph(l)(3)(i)(B) with one major change. OSHA has eliminated the requirementfor 24 hours of training for specialist employees and has replaced it witha requirement for annual training or demonstration of competency in theirarea of specialization. The required minimum hours of training was deletedbecause some employees may need more or may need less than 24 hours fortheir area of specialization. Specialized employees are by definition individualsspecialized in their area of expertise and should only require whateverlevel of training is necessary to maintain their level of competency. OSHAconsiders the other changes made to the language of this paragraph to beeditorial. In paragraph (q)(6) of the final rule OSHA addresses the training requirementsfor employees who will be responding to hazardous materials incidents.In paragraph (q)(6) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) OSHA has provided tieredtraining criteria for those employees who may be designated as membersof an emergency response team. The various levels of response and the requiredcompetency levels are based upon recognized levels of response being discussedin the hazardous materials response industry as recommended in severalof the comments made during this rulemaking. To illustrate OSHA's tiered approach to training, the following scenariodescribes a possible emergency response call. A state trooper is on routine patrol along a highway passing through aresidential and light industrial area of a large metropolitan city. Aheadin his path of travel, the trooper notices a multi-vehicle accident involvinga large overturned tank truck. Immediately the trooper uses his radio tocontact his dispatcher to report the accident. After letting the dispatcherknow the location and type of accident, the trooper places his vehicleacross the travel lanes of the highway approaching the accident site tostop traffic. While he is doing this the dispatcher is alerting the fireand rescue companies in the immediate area and dispatching an establishednumber of fire and rescue vehicles. The trooper then surveys the accidentscene from his vehicle trying to identify the type of cargo on the overturnedtruck. Seeing three different U.S. DOT placards on the vehicle the troopermakes note of the four digit numbers and checks his DOT Emergency ResponseGuide for a summary of actions to be taken for the chemicals identifiedon the placards. After determining his next on-site responsibility, herecontacts his dispatcher with the additional information and secures thescene. He stays away from the immediate accident site and does not becomeinvolved in rescue or site mitigation. While the trooper has been securing the scene, the fire and rescue unitsdispatched after his first radio call begin to arrive on the scene withthe additional information from the trooper's second call. The officer-in-charge(OIC) of the fire/rescue response stops his vehicles in a safe locationand contacts the state trooper. After determining the type of accidentand vehicles involved, the OIC takes control of the scene and directs hiscrews to take a predetermined defensive action in controlling a leak thathas begun on the tanker. The OIC then contacts the dispatcher and reportshis assessment of the accident scene including the fact that the tankeris now leaking. He requests the dispatcher to send him the closest hazardousmaterials response team. He also asks for representatives from the shipperof the liquid and the liquid's manufacturer.In the meantime, firefighters have established a perimeter defense of theaccident scene using fire hose lines and proper personal protective equipment.They begin to evacuate surrounding homes and businesses as indicated inthe Emergency Response Guide in case the leaking tanker should explode.They construct dikes and diversion pits to contain water and chemical run-offfrom the fire hose lines. Rescue personnel, including emergency medicaltechnicians, have made a preliminary assessment of the accident scene andhave determined whether any individuals in the spill area are trapped intheir vehicles or need immediate assistance. They report their observationsto the OIC. A decision is made by the OIC, based upon the reports of the police officer,the emergency response crew, and the data on the DOT placards, that norescue attempts can be made safely until such time as the leaking liquidis positively identified and controlled by the HAZMAT team. The properlocal authorities are notified under the requirements of SARA Title III.As firefighters continue to provide defensive protection of the scene andas emergency medical technicians establish a triage area for the treatmentof injured passengers, the HAZMAT team arrives and begins to take controlof the accident scene. Hazardous materials technicians and specialistsassess the scene and plan their attack on the leaking tanker. After equiping themselves properly, the HAZMAT team makes a final, pre-attackevaluation of the scene, including a scan of the area with appropriatemonitoring equipment, and reports its findings to the fire and rescue personnel.Based upon the results of the pre-attack evaluation and a determinationby HAZMAT team members using monitoring equipment that the spill area isnon-hazardous, rescue personnel now enter the area of the accident to provideemergency medical treatment to injured passengers and to extricate thosepassengers who may have been trapped in their vehicles. The HAZMAT teamproceeds to the point of release and secures the leak. After all the injured have been cared for and after the leak has been stopped,the firefighters and HAZMAT team begin to clean-up the accident scene inaccordance with pre-planned procedures. All four levels of hazardous materials response have played a role in thisscenario. The state trooper, the first on the scene, is the first responderawareness level. The first responding fire and rescue companies who providedthe defensive attack are the first responder operations level. The respondingHAZMAT team had both hazardous materials technicians and hazardous materialsspecialists. In this scenario the state trooper would have to have a sufficientamount of training, the first responding fire/rescue companies would needeight hours of training, and the HAZMAT team would need 24 hours of training.The tiered training schedule is based upon the duties and responsibilitiesof the individuals involved in the various levels of response illustratedin the scenario. In paragraph (q)(7) of the final rule OSHA is addressing the competencyof the trainers who will be providing the training necessary for thoseemployees responding to hazardous materials incidents. As discussed before,several commenters were concerned that OSHA's proposal for the qualificationsof trainers was too weak. In paragraph (q)(8) of the final rule OSHA is addressing refresher trainingfor those employees who have been trained in accordance with paragraph(q)(6). In paragraph (l)(3)(i)(A) of the proposal OSHA addressed the trainingof employees who perform emergency response at non-hazardous waste clean-upsites. OSHA is using this proposed language in paragraphs (q)(8)(i) and(q)(8)(ii) because the language of the proposal was intended to cover thetype of emergency response now regulated by paragraph (q). In paragraph (q)(9) of the final rule OSHA is using the language of paragraph(l)(4)(ii) of the proposal with some editorial change. The basic requirementthat employees who are members of an organized or designated HAZMAT teamand hazardous materials specialists receive a baseline physical examinationin accordance with paragraph (f) of this section remains the same as proposed.In paragraph (q)(10) of the final rule OSHA is using the proposed languageof paragraph (l)(4)(iii). In paragraph (q)(11) of the final rule OSHA is using the exact languageas proposed in paragraph (l)(5). In paragraph (l)(5) OSHA regulated post-emergencyclean-up and the language used in that paragraph has caused some confusion.Rather than change the basic requirement, OSHA is offering the followingclarification of the intent of paragraph (q)(11): Post-emergency response can be performed by two basic groups of employees:employees of the site, or employees from off of the site. Post-emergencyclean-up begins when the individual in charge of the initial emergencyresponse declares the site to be under control and ready for clean-up.For the purposes of this rule, paragraph (q)(11) will apply to those employeeswho come from other employers located off-of-the-site to perform post-emergencyclean-up. Employees of the employer at the site where the release occurred,and who perform post-emergency clean-up, are considered, under this rule,to be part of the initial emergency response and not subject to paragraph(q)(11). The reason for this distinction is that employees at the siteare more familiar with the types of emergencies that may occur and thetypes of clean-up operations that may have to take place. The more hazardousexposure to employees occurs when outside contractors or other off-siteemployees are brought into a strange environment and are expected to clean-upthe residue from a release. With this clarification, OSHA concludes thatno change to the proposed language is necessary. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Summary of the Preliminary Regulatory Impact and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis and Environmental Impact Assessment </ITAG>Introduction Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197, February 19, 1981) requires that aregulatory impact analysis be conducted for any rule having major economicconsequences for the national economy, individual industries, geographicalregions, or levels of government. In addition, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>)) requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) to determine whether a regulation will have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, and the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the agency to assess the environmental consequencesof regulatory actions. In order to comply with these requirements, OSHA has prepared a RegulatoryImpact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RIA) for the hazardous wasteoperations and emergency response standard. This analysis includes a profileof the industries that will be affected, the estimated number of employeeswho are at risk from occupational exposures to hazardous wastes, technologicalfeasibility, costs, benefits, and an overall economic impact of the standard.The RIA is available in the OSHA Docket Office. Data Sources The primary sources of information used for this analysis are: an April1987 report by the Eastern Research Group (ERG) entitled, ``Preparationof Data To Support a Regulatory Analysis and Environmental Assessment ofthe Proposed Standard for Working at Hazardous Waste Sites;'' and the commentssupplied in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the commentsmade during the public hearings, and the post-hearing comments and submissions.The information contained in the ERG report was gathered from the EnvironmentalProtection Agency sources, industry sources, experts in the area of hazardouswaste management, etc. Consequently, OSHA believes that it has given duenotice to all responsive parties and that the data used are the best availabledata for this final Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). Industry Profile The standard will affect about 20,000 uncontrolled hazardous waste sites,about 4,000 hazardous waste operations conducted under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act  (RCRA) of 1976, about 13,600 spills of hazardous materialsthat occur annually outside a fixed facility, and about 11,000 spills ofhazardous material that occur annually inside a fixed facility. The firmsthat will be affected by this standard are as follows: about 100 contractorsthat perform hazardous waste site clean-ups, about 50 engineering or technicalservices firms that perform hazardous waste preliminary assessments orsite investigations and remedial investigations or feasibility studiesfor hazardous waste site cleanups, about 300 RCRA-regulated commercialtreatment, storage and disposal facilities; about 3,700 RCRA-regulatedfacilities that are operated by a hazardous waste generator; about 19,000state and local police departments; about 28,000 fire departments; about750 private hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response teams; and about 22,000manufactures that use in-hours personnel to respond to emergency spillsof hazardous materials within the facility. Population at Risk As many as 1.758 million employees, police officers, and firefightersmay be at risk from exposure to hazardous waste or to hazardous materialsduring an emergency response to a hazardous material spill. Of these employees,about 14,000 work at uncontrolled hazardous waste site cleanups, 52,700at RCRA-regulated facilities, 563,200 are police officers, 944,500 arefirefighters, 7,500 are private HAZMAT members, and 176,000 are membersof industrial fire brigades that provide in-plant emergency responses tohazardous material spills. Most of these employees, however, do not workfulltime around hazardous waste. In fact, most police officers will notface a hazardous material emergency response and most fire fighters andindustrial fire brigade personnel, who are at risk, are annually exposedto hazardous materials for only a few hours. Feasibility The standard does not require the use of any large-scale capital equipmentthat is not currently used in normal work operations. In addition, eachprovision requires equipment and work practices that are currently available.Thus, OSHA has determined that the standard is technologically feasible. Benefits This standard will protect 1.757 million employees and firefighters fromhealth and safety hazards caused by their exposure to hazardous wastes.The benefits of this standard are quantified in Chapter 3 of the FinalRegulatory Analysis (FRA). The FRA indicates that this standard will prevent20 cancer deaths per year and from 6 to 20 deaths per year from cardiovascular,neurological, renal and liver disorders. The standard will also prevent1,925 injuries per year involving 18,700 lost work days. The FRA also estimatesthat 6 fatalities that are not illness related will be prevented. Thislast figure is likely to be an underestimate. Individual incidents whichare discussed in Chapter 3 and which may have been prevented by followingthe standard have sometimes led to more than 6 deaths. Also, the FRA doesnot take into account the benefits to the surrounding, non-worker communityderived from the better handing of hazardous waste and emergency responseincidents by the more qualified, properly trained and equiped responseteams that are likely to result from compliance with this standard. Chapter 3 of the FRA also presents risk rates. For example, the 17 excesscancer deaths per 1000 exposed hazardous waste workers for an occupationallifetime of exposures is likely to be reduced by 75 per cent. OSHA concludes therefore, that this standard will substantially reducethe significant risk of material impairment of health which results fromexposure to hazardous waste either at hazardous waste operations or fromemergency response. However, section 126 of SARA gives OSHA clear statutory directions toissue this standard and is reasonably explicit about what type of provisionsshould be included. Section 126 is also a free standing provision and notan amendment to the OSH Act. Accordingly, it evidences a legislative intentto issue these regulations without the specific need to quantify benefitsand reach significant risk conclusions.Cost of Compliance OSHA used current work practices as its baseline for estimating the costof full compliance with the standard. This estimated cost does not includeany cost that is currently being incurred by employers as part of theirwork practices because those work practices, and therefore those costs,would continue whether or not the final standard were promulgated. OSHA estimated that the total annualized incremental cost of full compliancewith the standard will be about $153.422 million, of which $27.966 millionwill be spent by contractors on government-mandated clean-ups of uncontrolledhazardous waste sites, $18.372 million will be spent by RCRA-regulatedfacility cleanups and operations, $17.332 million will be spent by policedepartments, $50.553 million will be spent by fire departments, $4.226million will be spent by private HAZMAT teams, and $29.179 million willbe spent by industrial fire brigades. The provision with the largest annualcost of compliance is the employee training provision ($92.978 million),followed by the medical surveillance provision ($11.293 million), the useof escape self-contained breathing apparatus ($9.507 million), and thewritten plan to minimize employee exposure to hazardous materials duringpostemergency cleanups of hazardous materials spills ($8.381 million).Economic Impacts Most of the incremental cost of compliance will be paid by the governmentor the private firm responsible for the hazardous waste cleanup. OSHA calculatedthat it is economically feasible for every affected industry or group tocomply with the standard. There may be an impact upon some labor marketsas a consequence of the provision that only sufficiently experience employees,or employees certified to have received the necessary training at an appropriatetraining facility, will be allowed to work on hazardous waste sites. Thisprovision will effectively curtail the current practice of using localsubcontractors to provide short-term employees for hazardous waste sitecleanups and limit the number of employees eligible to work at hazardouswaste sites. This in turn, may increase future wage rates and the costof hazardous waste site cleanups.Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Assistant Secretaryhas assessed the expected impacts of the standard on small entities. Basedon the available information, OSHA determined that the standard may havesome impact upon some small entities. The cost of adequately training anemployee off-site prior to working at a hazardous waste site cleanup willsubstantially reduce the use of subcontractor labor on a one-time basis.Thus, some local subcontractors face a potential reduction in hazardouswaste site cleanup work. The majority of this subcontracted work will probablybe performed by those subcontractors who concentrate upon this type ofwork. Subcontractors who have performed cleanup work but who do not electto train employees needed to qualify for future work will probably be excludedfrom working in this market. In addition, there could be an economic impact upon some small local firedepartments depending upon the amount of financial resources availableto them for additional training. With the allowance for different amountsof training hours depending upon the expected extent of involvement withhazardous materials spills, OSHA believes that this economic impact willnot significantly affect a substantive number of local fire departments.Environmental Impact Assessment_Finding of No Significant Impact OSHA reviewed the final standard and concluded that no significant environmentalimpacts are likely to result from its promulgation. In OSHA's December19, 1986, interim final rule for the protection of workers engaged in hazardouswaste and emergency response operations, information was solicited fromthe public on various issues, including possible environmental impactsof the regulation. On the basis of the review detailed below, and in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1500 et seq.), and the Department of Labor'simplementing regulations for NEPA compliance (29 CFR Part 11), the AssistantSecretary determined that the standard will not have a significant impacton the external environment. In most OSHA regulatory actions, two environments may be affected: (1)The workplace environment, and (2) the general human environment externalto the workplace, including impacts on air and water pollution, solid waste,and energy and land use. The hazardous waste standard, however, is uniquein that it focuses on the external environment because during these operations,the workplace and the external environment are usually one and the same.The standard is also unusual in that it is the first regulation since thepassage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act) tobe mandated specifically by Congress under section 126 of the SuperfundAmendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). As indicated in the earliersections of this Notice, the provisions of section 126 detail those protectionsthat OSHA must include for workers at hazardous waste and emergency responseoperations. For example, section 126 requires that provisions for siteanalysis, training, and medical surveillance, among others, be includedin the standard. In addition, there is a wide range of OSHA, EPA, and otherstandards that already apply to some activities that occur at hazardouswaste sites and during emergency response operations. For example, thereare existing OSHA standards that cover construction activities, onsitemachinery and equipment, selection and use of personal protective equipment,handling of toxic and explosive materials, and general environmental andsafety issues such as walking-working surfaces, noise, and illumination.Moreover, the final standard, in many instances, either reflects OSHA regulations,procedures adopted by other federal agencies (e.g. , EPA), or practicesthat are commonly used by those knowledgeable in hazardous waste and emergencyresponse operations. To the extent that existing standards, rules, or standardoperating procedures are incorporated into this rule, no significant changein the environment is anticipated.<ITAG tagnum="81">Potential Positive Environmental Effects</ITAG>While OSHA does not anticipate any significant environmental effects asa result of this standard, there is a potential for some beneficial impacts.In general, as the work practices and procedures requirements of the standardreduce the incidence of employee injury, an indirect result should be areduction in the likelihood of environmental releases of hazardous materials.(Virtually all provisions of the standard can be categorized in this manner,because once they are implemented, they will have a positive influenceon worker safety.) As these requirements also provide guidance for routinereactions to situations encountered in emergencies, they may help to reducethe severity of such emergencies. Additional potentially positive impactsmight be categorized as follows: (1) Direct benefits associated with reducedincidences in, or the severity of, the release of hazardous materials,and (2) indirect benefits associated with the improved flow of informationand increased worker awareness of hazardous materials or with improvedworker preparedness (either for normal site operations or for unexpectedaccidents). The following discussion highlights those provisions with potentiallybeneficial environmental effects.<T3>Monitoring (h).</T3> The requirements of this provision will increasethe amount of monitoring for airborne hazardous substances at uncontrolledhazardous waste sites. In some cases, hazardous materials will be detected,and steps will be taken to more quickly control the release to the atmosphere,thereby providing an environmental benefit.<T3>Handling drums and containers (j).</T3> A number of specific requirementsof this paragraph will result in potentially positive environmental impacts.Relevant subsections include: Inspecting drums and containers; making salvagedrums or absorbents available; initiating a spill containment program;emptying unsound drums and containers; requiring ground penetrating radar;and decontaminating equipment. These are discussed briefly in the followingsections.<T3>Inspection of drums/containers before moving (j)(1)(iii).</T3> Thissection requires that drums and containers be inspected for their integrityprior to handling and moving. Under current practices at hazardous wastecleanup sites, drums and containers are often handled with mechanized equipment(e.g., a barrel grapple on a backhoe arm) before being inspected, if unsounddrums rupture or leak, any solid contaminated by the rupture or leak isremoved for disposal upon completion of drum handling operations. Thisprovision will, through worker awareness, increase the probability of avertingruptures and leakage. In addition, any hazardous materials in containersthat cannot be moved without rupturing will have to be transferred to safecontainers (as required in paragraph (j)(1)(ix)), with obvious positiveenvironmental effect. These procedures will reduce the volume of contaminatedsoil requiring disposal and will also lower the possibility that leachateor runoff will carry contaminants offsite. This requirement does not havean impact on emergency response actions because the routines outlined arealready standard procedure.<T3>Availability of salvage drums/absorbents (j)(1)(vii).</T3> This provisionspecifies that salvage drums or containers as well as suitable amountsof proper absorbent be kept available for use in areas where spills, leaks,or ruptures might occur. This requirement will result in increased availabilityof salvage drums and spill absorbents at uncontrolled hazardous waste sitesand in emergency response situations where spills are imminent, therebyreducing the environmental consequences related to spills of hazardousmaterials. In those instances where salvage drums/absorbents would havebeen inadequate without this requirement, there is a potential benefitto the environment.<T3> Implement a spill containment program (j)(1)(viii).</T3> The purposeof this provision is to develop a program to be implemented, in the eventof a major spill, that would contain and isolate hazardous materials beingtransferred into containers and drums. To the extent that this programis implemented, there will be a potential for reducing the negative environmentaleffects that occur as a result of spills, leakage, etc. This requirementwill reduce the environmental impact of potential spills at cleanup sites.<T3>Empty unsound drum/containers (j)(1)(ix).</T3> Unsound containers oftenrupture during handling operations. This provision requires that drumsand containers that cannot be moved without spillage, leakage, or rupturebe emptied into a sound container. This requirement will reduce the incidenceof drum and container rupture and will provide concomitant environmentalbenefits.<T3>Use of a ground penetrating system to estimate depth and location ofcontainers (j)(1)(x).</T3> At present, when preliminary investigationsat hazardous waste sites indicate that buried drums or containers may bepresent, ground penetrating systems are frequently used to determine thedepth and location of the drums. The requirements of this provision willvery likely cause an increase in the use of these systems, thereby reducingthe number of instances in which buried containers would go undetectedor where undetected containers would be accidentally ruptured during excavationactivities. Where it applies, the requirement will help prevent accidentalruptures and spills, improve the thoroughness of remedial actions, andbenefit the site environment.<T3>Develop Decontamination Procedures (k).</T3> The requirement to cleanand decontaminate equipment, personnel, and personal protective equipmentwill prevent the migration of hazardous substances offsite, thereby benefittingthe surrounding environment. It will also eliminate or minimize the contaminationof personnel. Decontamination is already standard practice at most cleanupsites.<T3>Inform Contractors of Existing Hazards (b)(1)(iv).</T3> Under thisprovision, contractors are to be informed of any ``fire, explosion, healthor other safety hazards'' that are present. By ensuring that contractorsknow the location and nature of site hazards, this requirement will reducethe possibility that contractor activities will result in inadvertent releasesor spills of hazardous materials.<T3>Gather Information Before Site Entry (c)(4).</T3> Among the variousrequirements for site evaluation are those for information to be gatheredregarding the (a) pathways for hazardous substance dispersion, and (b)status and capability of emergency response teams. These procedural requirementswill result in an increased ability to predict and prevent movement offsiteof hazardous materials, will mitigate emergency situations quickly andeffectively, and will reduce the possibility or severity of contaminantrelease. As the requirements of the section mirror current practices, compliancewill be accomplished with little difficulty.<T3> Provide Worker Training (e).</T3> The training requirement will assurethat site activities will be carried out by qualified personnel, with theknowledge and ability to fulfill their job functions in a safe and responsiblemanner. To the extent that this occurs, there will be a potential benefitto the environment (in emergency-response situations, similar benefitsaccrue from emergency response training and RCRA-regulated facility employeetraining.) For example, worker training will result in a more careful handlingof materials accompanied by a reduction in the potential for inadvertentspills, improper disposal, etc. In emergency situations this training willassure a more efficient and effective cleanup of hazardous materials ora quicker response to avert further hazardous material releases.<T3> Informational Programs (i).</T3> These provisions include requirementsfor a site safety and health plan, pre-entry briefings, and site inspections.These requirements will not directly affect the existing environment; theirpurpose is to provide workers with the information necessary to carry outtheir activities safely. To the extent that this occurs, there will bea potential benefit to the environment. For example, implementing comprehensivesite plans will reduce the incidence of accident releases of hazardousmaterials. Similarly, requiring pre-entry briefings will reduce the likelihoodof employees unknowingly encountering contaminants or allowing their improperrelease or disposal.<T3> Emergency Response Plan (l) and (r).</T3> The development and implementationof a response plan for on-site and off-site emergencies will provide forgreater worker preparedness. In emergencies, workers will be able to respondmore quickly and effectively, thereby benefitting the environment.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Potentially Negative Impacts</ITAG> In some situations, there may be a potential for negative effects on theenvironment as a result of the standard. Any potential negative impacts,however, are not expected to be significant. To illustrate this, negativeimpacts may occur if there is an increase in the time required to implementspecific cleanup and spill response activities, or to implement safe workpractices or procedures required by the standard. Any such effects arelikely to be negligible, however since response teams already have establishedoperating procedures similar to those in OSHA's standard. Another potential negative impact may result from the requirement thatsalvage drums and absorbents be readily available. This may increase thenumber of repacked hazardous waste drums and the amount of spent absorbentused, which could add to the amount of material that would require safedisposal. Similarly, the requirements for implementation of proper decontaminationprocedures for all equipment, personal protective gear, and personnel athazardous waste emergencies, cleanup sites, and RCRA sites may result inan increase in the frequency and use of decontamination materials. This,in turn, could generate a larger volume of spent decontamination fluidswhich would then require proper handling and disposal. Again, any suchimpact should be negligible since decontamination is largely standard procedurefor most hazardous waste operations. A possible exception may be duringactivities that take place in the early stages of site evaluation beforecleanup, or at spill response, where decontamination procedures are notyet standardized.Conclusion To the extent that the work practices and procedures are implemented,increased worker awareness and preparedness will result in a safer andmore healthful work environment, which may indirectly benefit the environment.Any negative impacts that may occur as a result of the implementation ofthese work practices or procedures are expected to be negligible. Basedon this assessment and the information presented earlier in the preamble,OSHA concludes that no significant environmental changes are anticipatedas a result of the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. International Trade</ITAG>OSHA has evaluated the potential impact that this final standard wouldhave upon international trade. OSHA has determined that the final standardwould have a minimal potential impact upon the prices of products, so thatthere would be no effective change in the level of exported or importedproducts. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This section contains a collection of information pertaining to the preparationof a written safety and health plan site characterization and analysis,site control, training, medical surveillance, emergency controls, workpractices, PPE, monitoring, informational programs, handling drums andcontainers, decontamination, emergency response planning, and emergencyresponse drills. OMB has reviewed these collections and has approved themunder approval number 1218-0139. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

State Plan States</ITAG>This <T4>Federal Register </T4>document amends an interim final rule (section190.120, ``Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response'') in SubpartH of 29 CFR Part 1910, OSHA's general industry standards on hazardous materials.The 25 states with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and healthplans must develop a comparable standard applicable to both the privateand public (state and local government employees) sectors within six monthsof the publication date of this permanent final rule or show OSHA why thereis no need for action, e.g., because an existing state standard coveringthis area is already ``at least as effective'' as the new Federal standard.These states are Alaska, Arizona, California (for state and local governmentemployees only), Connecticut (for state and local government employeesonly), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Nevada, New Mexico, New York (for state and local government employeesonly), North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee,Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Afterthe effective date of this final rule, until such time as a state standardis promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance,as appropriate, in these states.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Federal and State Coverage of the Public Sector and Volunteers</ITAG>Federal OSHA is specifically precluded by section 3(5) of the OccupationalSafety and Health Act from covering employees of any State or politicalsubdivision thereof. However, States that elect to have their own occupationalsafety and health program under a plan approved and monitored by OSHA undersection 18(b) of the Act are required to extend their coverage to theseemployees (see section VII of this preamble for a list of these states).Thus, a State hazardous waste operations standard that is either identicalto or at least as effective as this Federal OSHA standard will apply topublic sector as well as private sector employees in these States. Publicsector employees in States without State plans will be protected from exposureto hazardous waste under Title I, section 126(f) of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), administered by the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA). This section requires EPA to promulgate, within90 days of the promulgation date of this Federal OSHA standard, an identicalstandard that applies to employees of State and local governments in eachState which does not have an OSHA-approved State plan. OSHA's hazardous waste operations standard and the identical or equivalentstandards which will be promulgated by States with OSHA-approved Stateplans apply under certain circumstances to volunteer firefighters and othervolunteers engaged in emergency response operations or hazardous wasteoperations within the scope of these standards (see paragraphs (a) (1)and (2) of this standard). In many communities, fire and other emergencyresponse services are provided by volunteer companies. In some cases, thesecompanies are established as independent, private sector entities. In others,they are considered a component of State or local government (see 29 CFR1975.5 for factors to consider in determining whether or not an entityis a public agency). A volunteer working for a public or private entityin a State with an OSHA-approved State plan must be considered an employeeunder State law in order to be covered by the State's hazardous waste operationsand emergency response standard_for example, because of an employer-employeerelationship or because of pay, retirement benefits, health insurance coverage,workers' compensation benefits, etc. This determination is made by eachState as part of its standards promulgation process. In a State withoutan OSHA-approved State plan, a private entity fire company with one ormore paid employees would be covered under this Federal standard (29 CFR1975.4). <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Federalism </ITAG>This final regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. Executive Order12612 requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limitingstate policy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions thatwould restrict state policy options, and take such actions only when thereis clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Executive Order provides for preemption of state law only ifthere is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any suchpreemption is to be limited to the extent possible. During the development of this rule, OSHA has, to the extent possible,refrained from limiting state policy options by developing a rule thatpermits flexibility on the part of the States through the use of performancelanguage. We have also consulted with the States, in particular those stateswith approved state OSHA plans, during the public hearings and commentperiod called for in the notice of proposed rulemaking for this rule. Wewill continue to work with the States that have state occupational safetyand health plans approved under section 18 of the OSHA Act to encouragethose states to develop their own policies to achieve program objectivesand continue to work with appropriate state officials as they present theirstate standards for approval. This rulemaking is directed by Congress under the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). The Constitutional authority andCongressional intent for Federal action in the area of worker protectionstandards for employees engaged in hazardous waste operations is mandatedclearly in section 126 of SARA. Congress therefore has identified the protectionof employees engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency responseas a problem of national scope through the enactment of SARA. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), permitsany state to develop its own independent state occupational safety andhealth program. Any state may develop and submit to OSHA, for approvaland use, a state occupational safety and health program that provides,among other things, worker protection ``at least as effective as'' thatprotection provided under the Federal program. With respect to Section 4 of Executive Order 12612, Section 18 of the OSHAct also expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws relatingto issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupationalsafety or health standards. Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemptiononly if it submits, and obtains Federal OSHA approval of, a plan for thedevelopment of such standards and their enforcement as mentioned above.Occupational safety and health standards developed by such approved Plan-Statesmust, among other things, be as least as effective in providing safe andhealthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards.OSHA has used its regulatory preemption of State law to the minimum levelnecessary to achieve the objectives of the OSH Act and section 126 of SARA.Section 126 of SARA, under paragraph (f), requires that the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) provide those state and local government workerswho are not covered by the protections of approved OSHA state plans withprotection that is identical to that provided under the Federal OSHA standards.Non-state and local government employees would be regulated by the FederalOSHA standard. State and local government workers, employed in 25 non-OSHAstate plan states, would not normally be covered by standards promulgatedunder Federal OSHA or approved state OSHA programs. OSHA has worked withEPA in the development of this final rule to assure that the protectionsprovided to all state and local government employees is consistent withthat provided by the Federal OSHA standard and the OSH Act. EPA as theregulatory authority for the non-OSHA state plan states will address theiractions with respect to worker protection policies that have federalismimplications in their rulemaking. This final rule is written so that employees engaged in hazardous wasteoperations and related emergency response operations in every state, includingthose state and local government employees in states regulated by EPA,would be protected by general, performance oriented standards. To the extentthat there are state or regional peculiarities caused by the types of hazardouswaste operations, including the types of related emergency response provided,states with occupational safety and health plans approved by OSHA undersection 18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own state standardsto address any special problems. This would assure the compatibility ofstate or local emergency response plans developed independently by stateor local emergency planning committees under Title III of SARA with Federalworker protection standards issued by OSHA and EPA. And, under the OSH Act, if a state develops its own OSHA approved stateprogram, it could make additional requirements in its standards. Statesthat will be covered by regulations issued by EPA under paragraph 126(f)of SARA will be provided the same option. Moreover, the performance natureof this final rule, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by statesand owners or operators of hazardous wastes sites or providers of emergencyresponse to provide as much safety as possible using varying methods consonantwith the conditions in each state. In summary, there is a clear national problem, identified by Congress,related to occupational safety and health in hazardous waste operationsand related emergency response. While the individual states, if all actedcollectively, might be able to deal with the safety problems involved,most have not elected to do so in the seventeen years since the enactmentof the OSH Act. Those states which have elected to participate under section18 of the OSH Act, would not be preempted by this final regulation andwould be able to address special, local conditions within the frameworkprovided by this performance oriented standard while ensuring that theirstandards are at least as effective as the Federal standard. State commentswere invited on the proposal and those that were submitted to the recordwere fully considered prior to promulgation of this Final Rule. The agency certifies that this document has been assessed in light of theprinciples, criteria, and requirements stated in sections 2 through 5 ofExecutive Order 12621. There are no provisions of this rulemaking thatare inconsistent with the principles, criteria, and requirements statedin sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12621. States which have approvedstate occupational safety and health plans may incur additional costs associatedwith standards development and enforcement as a result of this rulemaking.Funding for these approved state plan programs is available from OSHA undersection 18 of the OSH Act. This rulemaking would not change the State'sability to discharge traditional State governmental functions or otheraspects of State sovereignty.An outline of andSection; 1910.120 is included for the convenience of thereader as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Table of Contents </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">andSection; 1910.120 Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25 </C> <H1> </H1> (a) Scope, application, and definitions. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) Scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Definitions. </ITAG>(b) Safety and health program. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Organizational structure chapter of the site program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Comprehensive workplan chapter of the site program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Site-specific safety and health plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(i) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(ii) Elements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(iii) Pre-entry briefing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(iv) Effectiveness of site safety and health plan. </ITAG>(c) Site characterization and analysis. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Preliminary evaluation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Hazard identification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Required information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(5) Personal protective equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(6) Monitoring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(7) Risk identification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(8) Employee notification. </ITAG>(d) Site control. <ITAG tagnum="13">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(2) Site control program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">(3) Elements of the site control program.  </ITAG>(e) Training. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Elements to be covered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Frequency of training. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Management and supervisor training. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(5) Qualifications for trainers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(6) Training certification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(7) Emergency response. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(8) Refresher training. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(9) Equivalent training. </ITAG>(f) Medical surveillance. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Employees covered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Frequency of medical examinations and consultations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Content of medical examinations and consultations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(5) Examination by a physician and costs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(6) Information provided to the physician. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(7) Physician's written opinion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(8) Recordkeeping. </ITAG>(g) Engineering controls, work practices, and personal protective equipmentfor employee protection. <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) Engineering controls, work practices and PPE for substances regulatedin Subparts G and Z. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Engineering controls, work practices, and PPE for substances notregulated in Subparts G and Z. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Personal protective equipment selection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Totally-encapsulating chemical protective suits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(5) Personal protective equipment (PPE) program. </ITAG>(h) Monitoring.  <ITAG tagnum="12">(1) General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(2) Initial entry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(3) Periodic monitoring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">(4) Monitoring of high-risk employees. </ITAG>(i) Informational programs.

(iv) Employees engaged in emergency response and exposed to hazardoussubstances presenting an inhalation hazard or potential inhalation hazardshall wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus while engagedin emergency response, until such time that the individual in charge ofthe ICS determines through the use of air monitoring that a decreased levelof respiratory protection will not result in hazardous exposures to employees. (v) The individual in charge of the ICS shall limit the number of emergencyresponse personnel at the emergency site, in those areas of potential oractual exposure to incident or site hazards, to those who are activelyperforming emergency operations. However, operations in hazardous areasshall be performed using the buddy system in groups of two or more. (vi) Back-up personnel shall stand by with equipment ready to provideassistance or rescue. Advance first aid support personnel, as a minimum,shall also stand by with medical equipment and transportation capability. (vii) The individual in charge of the ICS shall designate a safety official,who is knowledgable in the operations being implemented at the emergencyresponse site, with specific responsibility to identify and evaluate hazardsand to provide direction with respect to the safety of operations for theemergency at hand. (viii) When activities are judged by the safety official to be an IDLHcondition and/or to involve an imminent danger condition, the safety officialshall have the authority to alter, suspend, or terminate those activities.The safety official shall immediately inform the individual in charge ofthe ICS of any actions needed to be taken to correct these hazards at anemergency scene.(ix) After emergency operations have terminated, the individual in chargeof the ICS shall implement appropriate decontamination procedures. (x) When deemed necessary for meeting the tasks at hand, approved self-containedcompressed air breathing apparatus may be used with approved cylindersfrom other approved self-contained compressed air breathing apparatus providedthat such cylinders are of the same capacity and pressure rating.

The suit is donned by a person wearingthe appropriate respiratory equipment (either a positive pressure self-containedbreathing apparatus or a positive pressure supplied air respirator) andworn inside the enclosed test room. The concentrated aqueous ammonia solutionis taken by the suited individual into the test room and poured into anopen plastic pan. A two-minute evaporation period is observed before thetest room concentration is measured, using a high range ammonia lengthof stain detector tube. When the ammonia vapor reaches a concentrationof between 1000 and 1200 ppm, the suited individual starts a standardizedexercise protocol to stress and flex the suit. After this protocol is completed,the test room concentration is measured again. The suited individual exitsthe test room and his stand-by person measures the ammonia concentrationinside the suit using a low range ammonia length of stain detector tubeor other more sensitive ammonia detector. A stand-by person is requiredto observe the test individual during the test procedure; aid the personin donning and doffing the TECP suit; and monitor the suit interior. Theintrusion coefficient of the suit can be calculated by dividing the averagetest area concentration by the interior suit concentration. A colorimetricammonia indicator strip of bromophenol blue or equivalent is placed onthe inside of the suit face piece lens so that the suited individual isable to detect a color change and know if the suit has a significant leak.If a color change is observed the individual shall leave the test roomimmediately. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.0_Required supplies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1 A supply of concentrated aqueous (58 percent ammonium hydroxideby weight). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.2 A supply of bromophenol/blue indicating paper or equivalent, sensitiveto 5-10 ppm ammonia or greater over a two-minute period of exposure.

Key factors involved in thisprocess are identification of the hazards, or suspected hazards; theirroutes of potential hazard to employees (inhalation, skin absorption, ingestion,and eye or skin contact); and the performance of the PPE <T3>materials </T3>(and seams) in providing a barrier to these hazards.The amount of protection provided by PPE is material-hazard specific. Thatis, protective equipment materials will protect well against some hazardoussubstances and poorly, or not at all, against others. In many instances,protective equipment materials cannot be found which will provide continuousprotection from the particular hazardous substance. In these cases thebreakthrough time of the protective material should exceed the work durations,or the exposure after breakthrough may not pose a hazardous level. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other factors in this selection process to be considered are matchingthe PPE to the employee's work requirements and task-specific conditions.The durability of PPE materials, such as tear strength and seam strength,should be considered in relation to the employee's tasks. The effects ofPPE in relation to heat stress and task duration are a factor in selectingand using PPE. In some cases layers of PPE may be necessary to providesufficient protection, or to protect expensive PPE inner garments, suitsor equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The more that is known about the hazards at the site, the easier thejob of PPE selection becomes. As more information about the hazards andconditions at the site becomes available, the site supervisor can makedecisions to up-grade or down-grade the level of PPE protection to matchthe tasks at hand. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following are guidelines which an employer can use to begin theselection of the appropriate PPE. As noted above, the site informationmay suggest the use of combinations of PPE selected from the differentprotection levels (i.e., A, B, C, or D) as being more suitable to the hazardsof the work. It should be cautioned that the listing below does not fullyaddress the performance of the specific PPE material in relation to thespecific hazards at the job site, and that PPE selection, evaluation andre-selection is an ongoing process until sufficient information about thehazards and PPE performance is obtained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Part A. </T3>Personal protective equipment is divided into four categoriesbased on the degree of protection afforded.

The atmosphere contains no known hazard; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Work functions preclude splashes, immersion, or the potential forunexpected inhalation of or contact with hazardous levels of any chemicals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>As stated before, combinations of personal protective equipmentother than those described for Levels A, B, C, and D protection may bemore appropriate and may be used to provide the proper level of protection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As an aid in selecting suitable chemical protective clothing, it shouldbe noted that the National Fire Protection Association is developing standardson chemical protective clothing. These standards are currently undergoingpublic review prior to adoption, including: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">NFPA 1991_Standard on Vapor-Protective Suits for Hazardous ChemicalEmergencies (EPA Level A Protective Clothing) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">NFPA 1991_Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for HazardousChemical Emergencies (EPA Level B Protective Clothing) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">NFPA 1993_Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Non-emergency,Non-flammable Hazardous Chemical Situations (EPA Level B Protective Clothing)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These standards would apply documentation and performance requirementsto the manufacture of chemical protective suits. Chemical protective suitsmeeting these requirements would be labelled as compliant with the appropriatestandard. When these standards are adopted by the National Fire ProtectionAssociation, it is recommended that chemical protective suits which meetthese standards be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix C_Compliance Guidelines</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Occupational Safety and Health Program. </T3>Each hazardous waste siteclean-up effort will require an occupational safety and health programheaded by the site coordinator or the employer's representative. The purposeof the program will be the protection of employees at the site and willbe an extension of the employer's overall safety and health program. Theprogram will need to be developed before work begins on the site and implementedas work proceeds as stated in paragraph (b). The program is to facilitatecoordination and communication of safety and health issues among personnelresponsible for the various activities which will take place at the site.It will provide the overall means for planning and implementing the neededsafety and health training and job orientation of employees who will beworking at the site. The program will provide the means for identifyingand controlling worksite hazards and the means for monitoring program effectiveness.The program will need to cover the responsibilities and authority of thesite coordinator or the employer's manager on the site for the safety andhealth of employees at the site, and the relationships with contractorsor support services as to what each employer's safety and health responsibilitiesare for their employees on the site. Each contractor on the site needsto have its own safety and health program so structured that it will smoothlyinterface with the program of the site coordinator or principal contractor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Also those employers involved with treating, storing or disposal ofhazardous waste as covered in paragraph (p) must have implemented a safetyand health program for their employees. This program is to include thehazard communication program required in paragraph (p)(1) and the trainingrequired in paragraphs (p)(7) and (p)(8) as parts of the employers comprehensiveoverall safety and health program. This program is to be in writing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each site or workplace safety and health program will need to includethe following: (1) Policy statements of the line of authority and accountabilityfor implementing the program, the objectives of the program and the roleof the site safety and health supervisor or manager and staff; (2) meansor methods for the development of procedures for identifying and controllingworkplace hazards at the site; (3) means or methods for the developmentand communication to employees of the various plans, work rules, standardoperating procedures and practices that pertain to individual employeesand supervisors; (4) means for the training of supervisors and employeesto develop the needed skills and knowledge to perform their work in a safeand healthful manner; (5) means to anticipate and prepare for emergencysituations; and (6) means for obtaining information feedback to aid inevaluating the program and for improving the effectiveness of the program.The management and employees should be trying continually to improve theeffectiveness of the program thereby enhancing the protection being affordedthose working on the site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accidents on the site or workplace should be investigated to provideinformation on how such occurrences can be avoided in the future. Wheninjuries or illnesses occur on the site or workplace, they will need tobe investigated to determine what needs to be done to prevent this incidentfrom occurring again. Such information will need to be used as feedbackon the effectiveness of the program and the information turned into positivesteps to prevent any reoccurrence. Receipt of employee suggestions or complaintsrelating to safety and health issues involved with site or workplace activitiesis also a feedback mechanism that can be used effectively to improve theprogram and may serve in part as an evaluative tool(s).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the development and implementation of the program to be the mosteffective, professional safety and health personnel should be used. CertifiedSafety Professionals, Board Certified Industrial Hygienists or RegisteredProfessional Safety Engineers are good examples of professional staturefor safety and health managers who will administer the employer's program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Training. </T3>The training programs for employees subject to the requirementsof paragraph (e) of this standard should address: the safety and healthhazards employees should expect to find on hazardous waste clean-up sites;what control measures or techniques are effective for those hazards; whatmonitoring procedures are effective in characterizing exposure levels;what makes an effective employer's safety and health program; what a sitesafety and health plan should include; hands on training with personalprotective equipment and clothing they may be expected to use; the contentsof the OSHA standard relevant to the employee's duties and function; and,employee's responsibilities under OSHA and other regulations. Supervisorswill need training in their responsibilities under the safety and healthprogram and its subject areas such as the spill containment program, thepersonal protective equipment program, the medical surveillance program,the emergency response plan and other areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The training programs for employees subject to the requirements ofparagraph (p) of this standard should address: the employers safety andhealth program elements impacting employees; the hazard communication program;the medical surveillance program; the hazards and the controls for suchhazards that employees need to know for their job duties and functions.All require annual refresher training.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The training programs for employees covered by the requirements ofparagraph (q) of this standard should address those competencies requiredfor the various levels of response such as: the hazards associated withhazardous substances; hazard identification and awareness; notificationof appropriate persons; the need for and use of personal protective equipmentincluding respirators; the decontamination procedures to be used; preplanningactivities for hazardous substance incidents including the emergency reponseplan; company standard operating procedures for hazardous substance emergencyresponses; the use of the incident command system and other subjects. Hands-ontraining should be stressed whenever possible. Critiques done after anincident which include an evaluation of what worked and what did not andhow could the incident be better handled the next time may be counted astraining time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For hazardous materials specialists (usually members of hazardousmaterials teams), the training should address the care, use and/or testingof chemical protective clothing including totally encapsulating suits,the medical surveillance program, the standard operating procedures forthe hazardous materials team including the use of plugging and patchingequipment and other subject areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Officers and leaders who may be expected to be in charge at an incidentshould be fully knowledgeable of their company's incident command system.They should know where and how to obtain additional assistance and be familiarwith the local district's emergency response plan and the state emergencyresponse plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specialist employees such as technical experts, medical experts orenvironmental experts that work with hazardous materials in their regularjobs, who may be sent to the incident scene by the shipper, manufactureror governmental agency to advise and assist the person in charge of theincident should have training on an annual basis. Their training shouldinclude the care and use of personal protective equipment including respirators;knowledge of the incident command system and how they are to relate toit; and those areas needed to keep them current in their respective fieldas it relates to safety and health involving specific hazardous substances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those skilled support personnel, such as employees who work for publicworks departments or equipment operators who operate bulldozers, sand trucks,backhoes, etc., who may be called to the incident scene to provide emergencysupport assistance, should have at least a safety and health briefing beforeentering the area of potential or actual exposure. These skilled supportpersonnel, who have not been a part of the emergency response plan anddo not meet the training requirements, should be made aware of the hazardsthey face and should be provided all necessary protective clothing andequipment required for their tasks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Decontamination. </T3>Decontamination procedures should be tailoredto the specific hazards of the site, and may vary in complexity and numberof steps, depending on the level of hazard and the employee's exposureto the hazard. Decontamination procedures and PPE decontamination methodswill vary depending upon the specific substance, since one procedure ormethod may not work for all substances. Evaluation of decontamination methodsand procedures should be performed, as necessary, to assure that employeesare not exposed to hazards by re-using PPE. References in Appendix F maybe used for guidance in establishing an effective decontamination program.In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard's Manual, ``Policy Guidance for Responseto Hazardous Chemical Releases,'' U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington,DC (COMDTINST M16465.30) is a good reference for establishing an effectivedecontamination program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Emergency response plans. </T3>States, along with designated districtswithin the states, will be developing or have developed local emergencyresponse plans. These state and district plans should be utilized in theemergency response plans called for in the standard. Each employer shouldassure that its emergency response plan is compatible with the local plan.The major reference being used to aid in developing the state and localdistrict plans is the <T3>Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning Guide, </T3>NRT-1. The currentEmergency Response Guidebook from the U.S. Department of Transportation,CMA's CHEMTREC and the Fire Service Emergency Management Handbook may alsobe used as resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employers involved with treatment, storage, and disposal facilitiesfor hazardous waste, which have the required contingency plan called forby their permit, would not need to duplicate the same planning elements.Those items of the emergency response plan that are properly addressedin the contingency plan may be substituted into the emergency responseplan required in 1910.120 or otherwise kept together for employer and employeeuse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Personal protective equipment programs. </T3>The purpose of personalprotective clothing and equipment (PPE) is to shield or isolate individualsfrom the chemical, physical, and biologic hazards that may be encounteredat a hazardous substance site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed in Appendix B, no single combination of protective equipmentand clothing is capable of protecting against all hazards. Thus PPE shouldbe used in conjunction with other protective methods and its effectivenessevaluated periodically.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The use of PPE can itself create significant worker hazards, suchas heat stress, physical and psychological stress, and impaired vision,mobility, and communication. For any given situation, equipment and clothingshould be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. However,over-protection, as well as under-protection, can be hazardous and shouldbe avoided where possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two basic objectives of any PPE program should be to protect the wearerfrom safety and health hazards, and to prevent injury to the wearer fromincorrect use and/or malfunction of the PPE. To accomplish these goals,a comprehensive PPE program should include hazard identification, medicalmonitoring, environmental surveillance, selection, use, maintenance, anddecontamination of PPE and its associated training.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The written PPE program should include policy statements, procedures,and guidelines. Copies should be made available to all employees, and areference copy should be made available at the worksite. Technical dataon equipment, maintenance manuals, relevant regulations, and other essentialinformation should also be collected and maintained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Incident command system (ICS). </T3>Paragraph 1910.120(q)(3)(ii) requiresthe implementation of an ICS. The ICS is an organized approach to effectivelycontrol and <T3>manage</T3> operations at an emergency incident. The individual incharge of the ICS is the senior official responding to the incident. TheICS is not much different than the ``command post'' approach used for manyyears by the fire service. During large complex fires involving severalcompanies and many pieces of apparatus, a command post would be established.This enabled <T3>one </T3>individual to be in charge of managing the incident, ratherthan having several officers from different companies making separate,and sometimes conflicting, decisions. The individual in charge of the commandpost would delegate responsibility for performing various tasks to subordinateofficers. Additionally, all communications were routed through the commandpost to reduce the number of radio transmissions and eliminate confusion.However, strategy, tactics, and all decisions were made by one individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ICS is a very similar system, except it is implemented for emergencyresponse to all incidents, both large and small, that involve hazardoussubstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For a small incident, the individual in charge of the ICS may performmany tasks of the ICS. There may not be any, or little, delegation of tasksto subordinates. For example, in response to a small incident, the individualin charge of the ICS, in addition to normal command activities, may becomethe safety officer and may designate only one employee (with proper equipment)as a back-up to provide assistance if needed. OSHA does recommend, however,that at least two employees be designated as back-up personnel since theassistance needed may include rescue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To illustrate the operation of the ICS, the following scenario mightdevelop during a small incident, such as an overturned tank truck witha small leak of flammable liquid.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The first responding senior officer would implement and take commandof the ICS. That person would size-up the incident and determine if additionalpersonnel and apparatus were necessary; would determine what actions totake to control the leak; and, determine the proper level of personal protectiveequipment. If additional assistance is not needed, the individual in chargeof the ICS would implement actions to stop and control the leak using thefewest number of personnel that can effectively accomplish the tasks. Theindividual in charge of the ICS then would designate himself as the safetyofficer and two other employees as a back-up in case rescue may becomenecessary. In this scenario, decontamination procedures would not be necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A large complex incident may require many employees and difficult,time-consuming efforts to control. In these situations, the individualin charge of the ICS will want to delegate different tasks to subordinatesin order to maintain a span of control that will keep the number of subordinates,that are reporting, to a manageable level.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Delegation of task at large incidents may be by location, where theincident scene is divided into sectors, and subordinate officers coordinateactivities within the sector that they have been assigned.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Delegation of tasks can also be by function. Some of the functionsthat the individual in charge of the ICS may want to delegate at a largeincident are: medical services; evacuation; water supply; resources (equipment,apparatus); media relations; safety; and, site control (integrate activitieswith police for crowd and traffic control). Also for a large incident,the individual in charge of the ICS will designate several employees asback-up personnel; and a number of safety officers to monitor conditionsand recommend safety precautions.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, no matter what size or complexity an incident may be, byimplementing an ICS there will be <T3>one individual in charge</T3> who makes the decisions and gives directions;and, all actions, and communications are coordinated through one centralpoint of command. Such a system should reduce confusion, improve safety,organize and coordinate actions, and should facilitate effective managementof the incident.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Site Safety and Control Plans.</T3> The safety and security of responsepersonnel and others in the area of an emergeny response incident siteshould be of primary concern to the incident commander. The use of a sitesafety and control plan could greatly assist those in charge of assuringthe safety and health of employees on the site.       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A comprehensive site safety and control plan should include the following:summary analysis of hazards on the site and a risk analysis of those hazards;site map or sketch; site work zones (clean zone, transition or decontaminationzone, work or hot zone); use of the buddy system; site communications;command post or command center; standard operating procedures and safework practices; medical assistance and triage area; hazard monitoring plan(air contaminate monitoring, etc.); decontamination procedures and area;and other relevant areas. This plan should be a part of the employer'semergency response plan or an extension of it to the specific site.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Medical surveillance programs.</T3> Workers handling hazardous substancesmay be exposed to toxic chemicals, safety hazards, biologic hazards, andradiation. Therefore, a medical surveillance program is essential to assessand monitor workers' health and fitness for employment in hazardous wasteoperations and during the course of work; to provide emergency and othertreatment as needed; and to keep accurate records for future reference.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The <T3>Occupational Safety and Health Guidance Manual for Hazardous WasteSite Activities</T3> developed by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA); October 1985 provides an excellent example of the types of medicaltesting that should be done as part of a medical surveillance program.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Appendix D_References. </T4>The following references may be consultedfor further information on the subject of this standard:   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.
