Industry executives said IBM will not only announce a series of its own software products but will announce alliances with some developers that provide software-writing tools. Other developers will say at the news conference that they will make their products mesh with IBM's, the executives said. IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., confirmed that it will make the announcement, but declined to provide details.    The executives generally welcomed the long-awaited announcement, but some consultants and competitors expressed skepticism. They said the strategy will initially focus on the mainframe environment and purely on IBM-compatible systems. And they said that to be really useful the strategy must better incorporate minicomputers, personal computers and hardware made by IBM's competitors.    Gartner Group Inc., a consulting firm, has been telling clients that some limited development projects will benefit from the IBM initiative as early as next year, but that broad benefits won't start to appear until 1993. &quot;The announcement will be very long on vision, very short on what's physically there,&quot; said Peter Levine, a consultant at Gartner Group.    Theodore F. Ryan, director of international business development at Electronic Data Systems Corp., said that, in any case, &quot;there's no silver bullet&quot; that will solve the software-development problem.    IBM's idea is to provide a framework for so-called computer-aided software engineering -- the main technology that customers are using to attack their backlogs of software-development work, which are often two to three years long. A solution to the backlog problem has been called the Holy Grail of the computer industry, because it would create demand for all sorts of additional hardware and software. Yet, while computer-aided software engineering products have been widely available, few work well together, and parts of the software-development process generally have been ignored. &quot;The software-engineering market has never had anybody come along before and say, 'These are the rules,'&quot; said Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.    The centerpiece of the IBM announcement will be something called a repository, which stores data about a company's software-development process. It contains rules about information -- where it should come from, who has access to it, how it should be presented on a screen and so forth. It also catalogs code that has been written throughout the company.    That saves time when programmers find that someone already has written a piece of a program that they need. It also means that fewer problems should develop down the road, because the code catalogued in the repository will generally have been used widely enough that any errors will have surfaced already.    Among other things, IBM also is expected to announce a version of its Cross System Product, which can be used to generate code from specifications provided by a programmer.    In addition, IBM is expected to disclose that it has incorporated into its products technology from three companies that it recently invested in -- Bachman Information Systems Inc., Knowledgeware Inc. and Index Technology Corp. IBM also is expected to say that it is working closely with some systems integrators, which, among other things, do software development for customers. Among them will be Computer Task Group Inc., another company IBM recently invested in.    The industry executives said IBM is making a big push to get customers and software developers to sign on to its strategy. IBM has put its sales force through extensive training, is briefing 200 big customers on its plans today and has a session set up for consultants Monday.    The executives said the real test will be whether customers decide IBM is moving fast enough on this or whether some of the initial versions of the products are too bare-bones to be very useful.    Some competitors will certainly complain that IBM has delivered too little and will try to persuade customers to ignore the IBM strategy. But IBM has shown that it still controls the standards at the high end of the computer industry -- despite the well-publicized wars over standards in personal computers and workstations.    Consultants pointed to DB2, a mainframe database language that was widely criticized as underpowered when IBM introduced it a few years ago. IBM repeatedly improved the product and it came to dominate that market.    Referring to the Tuesday announcement, Larry Bacon, a senior vice president at Travelers Corp., the insurance company, said: &quot;It would have been better if they had put together a complete product that you could just buy and run on your computer. But that's very easy to say and very hard to do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
