(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer hacker who has breachedlow-level security at a top federal weapons laboratory about 10times in the past week is being urged by officials to contact thelab ``to find out what he wants.''   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has spent nearly$100,000 in lost resources and attempts to stop the invader, whogains access through a national computer communications network, labofficials estimated.   No files or data in the computers appear to have been altered.   ``I've offered an invitation for him to call me through themedia,'' said Charles Cole, the lab's computer security manager.``I'd like to talk to him. My number's listed, or if he called thelaboratory he could get me very easily.''   Lab officials also are considering trying to contact the hackerthe next time he logs onto their computers by leaving a message forhim.   ``In one sense it would be nice if (the hacker) went away, butI'd rather he stayed with us for a while so we can find out what hewants,'' Cole said.   ``What worries me is where is he (in the system) that we don'tknow about,'' he added.   The lab, run by the University of California Berkeley, is one ofthe nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing ofnuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.   No classified computer systems have been affected, Cole said.   The hacker appeared in the lab's computers last weekend and hasbeen on and off the system ever since. The most recent appearancewas Thursday night, Cole said.   ``As best we can determine, he hasn't altered anything with theexception of creating a password for himself so he can get backon,'' he said, adding:   ``But he hasn't done anything really destructive on the system,and before he would be inclined to do that I hope he would talk tome about what his problem is.''   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by acomputer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by anotherhacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were throughdifferent holes in the system and there may yet be other accesspoints that have not been patched.   Cole said the intrusions do not involve a virus, a program thatcan order a computer to replicate itself or send it on to anothercomputer. ``This attack is being done by someone or a group who aremaneuvering into the system manually,'' he said.   The hacker has already broken federal laws which prohibitunauthorized use of federal computer systems, Cole said, and he mayhave violated state laws as well.   Cole speculated that the hacker is simply ``joy riding.''   It was determined that Stanford University and the University ofWashington were gateways from which the hacker entered the Livermoresystem by means of the Internet communications system, but it is notknown if the hacking originated there.   Part of the problem in tracing a hacker on Internet is that it isso large. Internet is used by research facilities and militarycontractors nationwide and there is no single path through whichmessages must travel.   The lab has closed the holes which they believe the hacker used.But a couple of computers have been left unprotected in an attemptto make contact or trace the person.   ``We could close up our system, in which case he would move on,''Cole said.</TEXT></DOC>
