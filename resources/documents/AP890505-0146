Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, shown on Iranian TVleaning on an AK-47 assault rifle, urged Palestinians to ``declareopen war on American interests throughout the world.   ``Why don't you hijack planes in order to swap prisoners inIsraeli hands, or blow up factories in Western countries?'' he saidin a sermon during the weekly Shiite Moslem prayer session atTehran University.   Rafsanjani, whose emotional speech was broadcast on Tehran Radioand monitored in Nicosia, was interrupted by thousands of Shiiteworshipers who chanted ``Death to Israel!''   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidRafsanjani's comments were ``appalling'' and ``another stepbackwards for Iran from the community of civilized nations.   ``It is an exhortation for Palestinians to commit terrorism andonly serves to confirm that terrorism remains an integral featureof Ayatollah Khomeini's regime,'' he said.   Fitzwater said the United States would hold Iran responsible forany attacks on American interests or citizens.   He compared the comments to Iran's threats against Britishauthor Salman Rushdie, author of the book ``The Satanic Verses.''Many Moslems say the book blasphemes Islam and Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini has called for the author to be killed.   After Rafsanjani's remarks, the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency reported that the Tehran office of the West German airlineLufthansa was attacked Friday while it was closed for the Moslemweekend.   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, gave no details but said theoffice ``sustained some damage.''   In his remarks, Rafsanjani stressed that the United Statesshould be singled out as Israel's main backer but that Britons andFrenchmen also should be targets.   ``If for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine (thePalestinians) kill five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen outside,the Zionists would not dare continue these wrongs,'' Rafsanjanisaid.   ``It isn't so hard to kill Americans or Frenchmen, becausethey're all over the globe. It's a bit difficult to kill Israelis,because there aren't as many of them around in other parts of theworld,'' he said.   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the West Bankand Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the1967 Middle East war.   Rafsanjani denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leaderYasser Arafat's peace initiative, in which he has renouncedterrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.   The speaker said Israel and its allies ``will never allow theformation of ... a Palestinian state. It is impossible.''   The extremist remarks by Rafsanjani, which came on the lastFriday of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, underlined a new andgrowing anti-Western trend in Iran that is part of a radicalresurgence.   Khomeini, soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamicrevolution, set aside May 5 as Qods Day, the Arabic name forJerusalem. He has called on Islamic nations to free Jerusalem,Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina, from Israelirule.   As Rafsanjani spoke, Iran's official Islamic Republic NewsAgency reported that millions of Iranians took to the streets inTehran and other cities to pledge support for the Palestinians,chanting ``Death To Israel! Death To America!''   Rafsanjani, who also is Iran's acting commander-in-chief, saidthe West would now say he was ``officially called for acts ofterror.   He declared: ``Let them say it. Aren't they already saying it?''   ``They commit atrocities under the guise of human rights? Wewill do the same,'' Rafsanjani said. ``We too will strive in thename of our rights to defend our people.''</TEXT></DOC>
