Not quite, but this fall, Leonard Nimoy, who played the pointy-eared alien on &quot;Star Trek,&quot; will host &quot;Adventures in Space,&quot; a four-hour retrospective on space exploration using NBC News footage and network correspondents.    The series will first air on the seven stations owned and operated by NBC. But the General Electric Co. subsidiary also has signed an agreement with syndicator LBS Communications Inc. to sell the series to approximately 160 stations, including affiliates of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. LBS will also handle overseas sales, while NBC plans to pitch the program to cable-TV companies and release it on videocassette.    &quot;Adventures in Space&quot; is just one of several projects under development at the network's newly formed NBC News Productions. As the cost of covering the news continues to soar, network news divisions are aggressively exploring ways to stretch their thousands of hours of videotape into saleable products for other markets, including syndication, cable television and videocassettes.    The three networks are betting that ventures like NBC News Productions can generate additional revenue at little extra cost, while helping to promote the news operations. &quot;This is gravy for the news divisions because they already have all the vintage footage just sitting around,&quot; says Betsy Niesyn, managing editor of Home Video Publishing, a weekly newsletter. &quot;Why not let it work for them?&quot;    Admittedly there are risks, not the least of which is whether there is a big enough consumer appetite for vintage news footage. Yes, the family may gather around the television set to watch a copy of &quot;Top Gun&quot; for the umpteenth time, but how many times can one watch &quot;1987: The Unforgettable Year,&quot; a videocassette released by NBC?    Annual sales of &quot;news&quot; videocassettes have surged to about $10 million from less than $2 million just two years ago, according to Home Video's Ms. Niesyn. But that's still minuscule compared with the whopping $750 million in annual sales just for children's programming on cassettes.    &quot;It's a business. Not a large business, but a business nonetheless,&quot; says Ken Ross, vice president of video at CBS. &quot;You have to be clever and come up with reasons for people to watch something that is not current.&quot;    CBS knows that lesson all too well. In 1984, CBS/Fox Video, a joint venture of CBS and 20th Century Fox Inc., thought that a &quot;Best of '60 Minutes' &quot; videocassette series would be a natural hit. After two volumes bombed, however, the series was dropped. &quot;We have to figure out a way to market that kind of tape in a better fashion,&quot; Mr. Ross says.    But CBS has had successes as well. A video called &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; with Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather, produced by CBS News and distributed by CBS Video Library, sold about 40,000 cassettes to video shops and individuals. The sales generate $6.50 per cassette for CBS News. A series of cassettes on the Vietnam War, anchored by Mr. Cronkite, has already earned $1.5 million for CBS News, according to a CBS News official who asked not to be identified.    Last month, CBS Video Library released &quot;On the Road With Charles Kuralt&quot; -- three one-hour compilations of folksy reports from the affable CBS News correspondent.    ABC News, meanwhile, is jointly producing programs aimed at cable markets. Two programs it made in collaboration with Weintraub Productions -- &quot;Heroes,&quot; about people who performed heroic feats, and &quot;The Eagle and the Bear,&quot; about U.S.Soviet relations -- have been sold to the Arts andamp; Entertainment cable channel.    Of the three networks' news divisions, NBC's has perhaps the most to gain from repackaging its products. Its flagship news broadcast, &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,&quot; ranks last in ratings compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., and the division's annual operating budget of about $245 million is under constant strain. &quot;My mission is to broaden our business, promote NBC News and bring in incremental revenues while maintaining the quality of NBC News,&quot; says Therese Byrne, NBC News vice president, marketing and business development, and head of NBC News Productions.    One of the most ambitious plans under development at NBC is &quot;NBC News Pulse,&quot; a monthly audiocassette that would encapsulate one month's worth of NBC News programs. NBC has already produced a pilot for the cassettes, which it plans to market as a subscriber service to groups and corporations.    Not all the ideas are so straight-laced. NBC News is exploring the possibility of forming a subdivision to distribute offbeat tapes, such as a compilation of flubs by President Bush.    NBC also is putting together an annual &quot;World News Atlas&quot; with Rand McNally Co. that would show maps identifying where major news events occurred. And it is holding discussions with Time-Warner Inc. to jointly produce a history series on videocassette.    &quot;All of this activity gets the word out on NBC News and enhances the image of NBC News,&quot; says Ms. Byrne. &quot;Maybe if people start seeing NBC News popping up, more will tune to Nightly News.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
