As amended by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services,and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978 (Sec. 119, Pub. L. 95-602,92 Stat. 2982), and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L.99-506, 100 Stat. 1810), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States,* * * shall, solely by reason of his handicap[s], be excluded from theparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discriminationunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance <T3>or under any program or activity conducted by an Executive agency orby the United States Postal Service. The head of each such agency shallpromulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendmentsto this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulationshall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress,and such regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day afterthe date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.</T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(29 U.S.C. 794) (1978 amendment italicized). The substantive nondiscrimination of the agency, as set forth in this proposedrule, are identical, for the most part, to those established by Federalregulations for programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.See 28 CFR Part 41 (section 504 coordination regulation for federally assistedprograms). This general parallelism is in accord with the intent expressedby supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate, including its sponsor,Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government should have the samesection 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financial assistance.124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124 Cong. Rec.E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>id.;</T3> 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); id. at38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarisin). There are, however, some language differences between this proposed ruleand the Federal Government's section 504 regulations for federally assistedprograms. These changes are based on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College</T3> v. <T3>Davis,</T3> 442 U.S. 397 (1979), and the subsequent circuit court decisionsinterpreting Davis and section 504. <T3>See Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt,</T3> 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association</T3> v. <T3>Lewis,</T3> 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (<T3>APTA</T3>); <T3>see also Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee </T3>v. <T3>Rhode Island Public Transit Authority,</T3> 718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir.1983). These language differences are also supported by the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate,</T3> 469 U.S. 287 (1985), where the Court held that the regulationsfor federally assisted programs did not require a recipient to modify itsdurational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital care forhandicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis</T3> decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>id.</T3> at 300 and explicitly noted that ``[t]he regulations implementingsection 504 (for federally assisted programs) are consistent with the viewthat <T3>reasonable</T3> adjustments in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 301 n.21 (emphasis added). Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this regulation implementingsection 504 for federally conducted programs consistent with the FederalGovernment's regulations implementing section 504 for federally assistedprograms as they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Many of thesefederally assisted regulations were issued prior to the interpretationsof section 504 by the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis,</T3> by lower courts interpreting <T3>Davis,</T3> and by the Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander.</T3> Therefore, their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Of course, these federally assisted regulations must be interpretedto reflect the holdings of the Federal judiciary. Hence, the agency believesthat there are no significant differences between this proposed rule forfederally conducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretationof section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs. This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is an adaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justiceunder Executive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) anddistributed to Executive agencies. This regulation has also been reviewed by the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp.,p. 206). It has been determined that this proposed regulation is not a major rulewithin the meaning of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp.,p. 127) and, therefore, a regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared.It is further certified that the regulation does not have a significanteconomic impact on small entities. It is not, therefore, subject to theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>Section 17.101 Purpose Section 17.101 states the purpose of the proposed rule, which is to effectuatesection 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and DevelopmentalDisabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalService. Section 17.102 Application The proposed regulation applies to all programs or activities conductedby the agency but does not include programs or activities outside the UnitedStates that do not involve individuals with handicaps in the United States.Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is, in simpleterms, anything a Federal agency does. Aside from employment, there aretwo major categories of federally conducted programs or activities coveredby this regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoingagency operations and those directly administered by the agency for programbeneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first category includecommunication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, orinterviews) and the public's use of the agency's facilities. Activitiesin the second category include programs that provide Federal services orbenefits. Section 17.703 Definitions ``Agency.'' For purposes of this part, ``agency'' means the Departmentof the Treasury. ``Assistant Attorney General.'' ``Assistant Attorney General'' refers tothe Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Departmentof Justice. ``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enablepersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equalopportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of the agency's programsor activities. The definition provides examples of commonly used auxiliaryaids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by andSection;17.160(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirements ofthe regulations. ``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include allthe information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the complaint.The definition is necessary, because the 100-day period for the agency'sinvestigation (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 17.170(g)) begins when the agency receives a completecomplaint. ``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.3(f)), except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added and the phase ``or interest in such property'' has beendeleted because the term ``facility,'' as used in this regulation, refersto structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however,be noted that the regulations applies to all programs and activities conductedby the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they are conductedis owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the agency. The term ``facility''is used in andSection;andSection; 17.149, 17.150 and 17.170(f). ``Individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``individual with handicaps''is substantially similar to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearingin the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs(28 CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin this regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.``Qualified individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' is a revised version of the definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' appearing in the section 504 Coordination Regulationfor federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32). Paragraph (1) deviates from existing regulations for federally assistedprograms because of intervening court decisions. It defines ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' with regard to any program under which a personis required to perform services or to achiever a level of accomplishment.In such programs a qualified individual with handicaps is one who can achievethe purpose of the program without modifications in the program that theagency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in thenature of the program. This definition reflects the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3><T4>v. </T4><T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1976). In that case, the Court ruled thata hearing-impaired applicant to a nursing school was not a ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' because her hearing impairment would prevent herefrom participating in the clinical training portion of the program. TheCourt found that, if the program were modified so as to enable the respondentto participate (by exempting her from the clinical training requirements),``she would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursingprogram normally gives.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 410. It also found that ``the purpose of (the) programwas to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customaryways,'' <T3>id.</T3> at 413, and that the respondent would be unable, because ofher hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of a registerednurse. It therefore concluded that the school was not required by Section504 to make such modifications that would result in ``a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 410. Treasury has incorporated the Court's language in the definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' in order to make clear that such a person mustbe able to participate in the program offered by the agency. The agencyis required to make modifications in order to enable an applicant withhandicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentallydifferent nature. The test is whether, with appropriate accommodation,the applicant can achieve the purpose of the program offered; not whetherthe applicant could benefit or obtain results from some other program thatthe agency does not offer. Although the revised definition allows exclusionof some individuals with handicaps from some programs, it requires thatan individual with handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose ofthe program must be accommodated, provided that the accommodations do notfundamentally alter the nature of the program. The agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed modificationwould constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of its programor activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modification would resultin such an alteration, the agency must follow the procedures establishedin andSection;andSection; 17.150(a) and 17.160(d), which are discussed below,for demonstrating that an action would result in undue financial and administrativeburdens. That is, the decision must be made by the agency head or his orher designee in writing after consideration of all resources availablefor the program or activity and must be accompanied by and explanationof the reasons for the decision. If the agency head determines that anaction would result in a fundamental alteration, the agency must consideroptions that would enable the individual with handicaps to achieve thepurpose of the program but would not result in such an alteration. For programs or activities that do not fall under the first paragraph,paragraph (2) adopts the existing definition of ``qualified handicappedperson'' with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) in the coordinationregulation for programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Under thisdefinition, a qualified individual with handicaps is an individual withhandicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participationin the program or activity.Paragraph (3) explains that ``qualified individual with handicaps'' means``qualified handicapped person'' as that term is defined for purposes ofemployment in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulationat 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by andSection;17.140. Nothing in this part changes existing regulations applicable toemployment.``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this regulation,``Section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conducted by theagency and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federal financialassistance.Section 17.110 Self-evaluationThe Department shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluationrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504.Section 17.111 NoticeSection 17.111 requires the agency to make available sufficient informationto interested persons including employees, applicants, participants, andbeneficiaries of Treasury programs and activities to apprise them of rightsand protections afforded by section 504 and this regulation. Methods ofproviding this information may include, for example, the publication ofinformation in handbooks, manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed tothe public to describe the agency's programs and activities; the displayof informative posters in service centers and other public places; or thebroadcast of information by television or radio.Section 17.130 General Prohibitions Against DiscriminationSection 17.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51).Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection; 17.130 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates thismandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remainingsections of the regulation. If the agency violates a provision in any ofthe subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the general prohibitionsfound in andSection; 17.130. When there is no applicable subsequent provision,the general prohibitions stated in this section apply.Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individualswith handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an individual withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from itsprogram simply because the person is handicapped. Such blatantly exclusionarypractices often result from the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutelyexclude certain classes of disabled persons (<T3>e.g.</T3>, epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons with heartailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard toan individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable presumptionis permissible only when in all cases a physical condition by its verynature would prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibilityrequirements for participation in the activity in question. It would bepermissible, therefore, to exclude without an individual evaluation, allpersons who are blind in both eyes from eligibility for a license to operatea commercial vehicle in interstate commerce. It may not be permissibleto automatically disqualify all those who are blind in just one eye.Section 504, however, prohibits more than just the most obvious denialsof equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs toa program if the facility in which the program is conducted is inaccessible.Paragraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, requires that the opportunity to participateor benefit afforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective asthat opportunity afforded to others. The later sections on program accessibility(andSection;andSection; 17.149-17.151) and communications (andSection; 17.160)are specific applications of this principle.Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its programsor activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs ofqualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), in conjunctionwith paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop separate or differentaids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide individuals withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from theagency's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) provides that differentor separate aids, benefits, or services to qualified handicapped personsis not justified unless such action is necessary to provide individualswith handicaps with aids, benefits, or services as effective as those providedothers. Even when separate or different aids, benefits, or services wouldbe more effective, paragraph (b)(3) provides that a qualified individualwith handicaps may still choose to participate in the program that is notdesigned to accommodate individuals with handicaps. It is not appropriateto assume that all individuals with handicaps should participate in a special``handicapped'' program even if the program is designed to meet the particularneeds of some individuals with handicaps. This is intended to ensure thatindividuals with handicaps are not unnecessarily segregated from nonhandicappedpeople or subjected to arbitrary or stereotypical limitations on theirparticipation in federally conducted programs.Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified individualwith handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planningor advisory board.Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from otherwise limiting a qualifiedindividual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage,or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service.Paragraph (b)(2) is taken from the Department of Health, Education, andWelfare's (now Health and Human Services) original regulation implementingsection 504 for programs and activities to which it provides Federal financialassistance (45 CFR 84.4(b)(2)). It clarifies that the agency is requiredto provide equal opportunities to individuals with handicaps, but is notrequired to guarantee equality of results.Paragraph (b)(4) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the agency'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written agency policies and to the actual practicesof the agency. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary policiesor practices and nonessential policies and practices that are neutral ontheir face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunityto participate.Paragraph (b)(5) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;17.130(b)(4) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the agency. Paragraph(b)(5) does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existingsite.Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the agency, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.Paragraph (b)(7) prohibits the agency from discriminating against qualifiedindividuals with handicaps on the basis of handicap in the granting oflicenses or certifications. A person is a qualified individual with handicapswith respect to licensing or certification, if he or she can meet the essentialeligibility requirements for receiving the license or certification (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 17.103). In addition, the agency may not establish requirements for the programsor activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualifiedindividuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.For example, the agency must comply with this requirement when establishingsafety standards for the operations of licensees. In that case the agencymust ensure that standards that it promulgates do not discriminate againstthe employment of qualified individuals with handicaps in an impermissiblemanner. Paragraph (b)(7) does not extend section 504 directly to the programs oractivities of licensees or certified entities themselves. The programsor activities of Federal licensees or certified entities are not themselvesfederally conducted programs or activities nor are they programs or activitiesreceiving Federal financial assistance merely by virtue of the Federallicense or certificate. However, as noted above, section 504 may affectthe content of the rules established by the agency for operation of theprogram or activity of the licensee or certified entity, and thereby indirectlyaffect limited aspects of their operations. Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statuteor Executive Order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicapsor a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to thoseindividuals with handicaps. Paragraph (d) provides that the agency must administer programs and activitiesin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individualswith handicaps, <T3>i.e., </T3>in a setting that enables individuals with handicaps tointeract with nonhandicapped persons to the fullest extent possible. Section 17.140 Employment. Section 17.140 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employmentby the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, coversthe employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner </T3>v. <T3>Morris, </T3>752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6th Cir. 1984); <T3>Prewitt </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>662 F.2d 292, 301-04 (5th Cir. 1981);<T3>Contra McGuiness </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>744 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th Cir. 1984); <T3>Boyd </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service, </T3>752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir. 1985). Courts uniformly have held that in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504, <T3>Smith, </T3>742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt, </T3>662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 17.140 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirement and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR Part 1613. In addition to this section, 17.170(b) specifiesthat the agency will use the existing EEOC procedures to resolve allegationsof employment discrimination. Responsibility for coordinating enforcementof Federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned tothe EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp. p. 206). Under thisauthority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on non-discriminationin employment on the basis of handicap. While this rule could define termswith respect to employment and enumerate what practices are covered andwhat requirements apply, the agency has adopted EEOC's recommendation thatto avoid duplicative, competing, or conflicting standards with respectto Federal employment, reference in these regulations to the government-wideEEOC rules is sufficient. The class of Federal employees and applicantsfor employment covered by section 504 is identical to or subsumed withinthat covered by section 501. To apply different or lesser standards topersons alleging violations of section 504 could lead unnecessarily toconfusion in the enforcement of the Rehabilitation Act with respect toFederal employment. Section 17.149 Program Accessibility: Discrimination Prohibited Section 17.149 states the general non-discriminate principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 17.150 and17.151. Section 17.150 Program Accessibility: Existing Facilities This regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existingsection 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 17.150 requires that each agency program or activity, whenviewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. The regulation also makes clear that the agency is notrequired to make each of its existing facilities accessible (andSection;17.150(a)(1)). However, andSection; 17.150, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, places explicitlimits on the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility (andSection;17.150(a)(2)). Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the scopeof the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement the agencyis not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. A similar limitation is provided in andSection;17.160(d). This provisionis based on the Supreme Court's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not requireprogram modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the natureof a program, and on the Court's statement that Section 504 does not requiremodifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644, (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis (APTA), </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Paragraphs (a)(2) and 17.160(d) are also supported by the Supreme Court'sdecision in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementting regulation. <T3>Id. </T3>at 299. Relying on <T3>Davis</T3>, the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicappedpersons ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers,''<T3>id</T3>. at 301, and what ``<T3>reasonable adjustments</T3> in the nature of the benefit being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute `fundamental alteration[s]in the nature of a program.' '' <T3>Id.</T3> at n.20 (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander</T3> supports the position, based on <T3>Davis</T3> and earlier, lower court decisions that there are situationswhen accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency's programor activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrative burdensthat the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory.Failure to include such a provision could lead to judicial invalidationof the regulation or reversal of a particular enforcement action takenpursuant to the regulation. This paragraph, however, does not establishan absolute defense; it does not relieve the agency of all obligationsto individuals with handicaps. Although the agency is not required to takeactions that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature ofa program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens,it nevertheless must take any other steps necessary to ensure that individualswith handicaps receive the benefits and services of the federally conductedprogram or activity.  It is our view that compliance with andSection;17.150(a) would in most casesnot result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the agency.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation ofthe conducted program or activity should be considered.  The burden of proving that compliance with andSection;17.150(a) would fundamentallyalter the nature of a program or activity or would result in undue financialand administrative burdens rests with the agency. The decision that compliancewould result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency heador his or her designee and must be accomplished by a written statementof the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Any person who believes thathe or she has been injured by the agency head's decision or failure tomake a decision may file a compliant under the compliance procedures establishedin section 17.170.  Paragraph (b) sets forth a number of means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provisions of aides. In choosing among methods,the agency shall give priority consideration to those that will be consistentwith provisions of services in the most integrated setting possible. Structuralchanges in existing facilities are required only when there is no otherfeasible way to make the agency's program accessible. (Is should be notedthat ``structural changes'' include all physical changes to a facility;the term does not refer only to changes to structural features such asremoval of or alterations to a loading-bearing structural member.) Theagency may comply with the program accessibility requirement by deliveringservices at alternate accessible sites or making home visits as appropriate. Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make any necessary structuralchanges in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later thanthree years after the effective date of this regulation. Where structuralmodifications are required, a transition plan shall be developed withinsix months of the effective date of this regulation. Aside from structuralchanges, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance shall be takenwithin sixty days.  Section 17.151 Program Accessibility: New Contruction and Alterations Overlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction under section504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157).Section 17.151 provides that those buildings that are constructed or alteredby, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed,or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicapsin accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600 through 101-19.607. This standardwas promulgated pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, asamended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe that it is appropriate to adoptthe existing Architectural Barriers Act standard for section 504 compliancebecause new and altered buildings subject to this regulation are also subjectto the Architectural Barriers Act. Further, adopting of the standard willavoid duplicative and possibly inconsistent standards.  Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of thisregulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility standardssimply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, to the programaccessibility standard for existing facilities in andSection;17.150. To theextent the buildings are newly contructed or altered, they must also meetthe new construction and alteration requirements of andSection;17.151.  Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildingsas subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlikethe construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoidedat little or no cost, the application of new construction standards toan existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofittingbuildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the agency believesthe same program accessibility standard should apply to both owned andleased existing buildings.  Section 17.160 Communications  Section 17.160 requires that the agency take appropriate steps to effectivelycommunicate with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants, participants,and members of the public. These steps shall include procedures for determiningwhen auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection;17.160(a)(1) to affordan individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, andenjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or activity. They shall alsoinclude an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request the auxiliaryaids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be given primary considerationby the agency andSection;17.160(a)(1)(i)). The agency shall honor the choiceunless it can demonstrate that another effective means of communicationexists or that use of the means chosen would not be required under andSection;17.160(d).That paragraph limits the obligation of the agency to ensure effectivecommunication in accordance with <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see supra</T3> preamble discussion of andSection;17.150(a)(3)). Unlessnot required by andSection;17.160(d), the agency shall provide auxiliaryaids at no cost to the individual with handicaps.  The discussion of andSection;17.150(a), Program accessibility: Existing facilities,regarding the determination of undue financial and administrative burdensalso applies to this section and should be referred to for a complete understandingof the agency's obligation to comply with andSection;17.160.  In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be sufficientto permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired person. In manycircumstances, however, they may not be, particularly when the informationbeing communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthly period of time(<T3>e.g.,</T3> a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participantis not skilled in spoken or written language. In these cases, a sign languageinterpreter may be appropriate. For vision-impaired persons, effectivecommunication might be achieved by several means, including readers andaudio recordings. In general, the agency intends to inform the public of(1) the communications services it offers to afford individuals with handicapsan equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs oractivities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular mode of communication,and (3) the agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids if it can demonstratethat several different modes are effective.The agency shall effectively communicate with vision-impaired and hearing-impairedpersons involved in hearings conducted by the agency. Auxiliary aids shallbe used where necessary for effective communication. If sign language interpretersare necessary, the agency may require that it be given reasonable noticeprior to the proceeding of the need for an interpreter. The agency will not provide individually prescribed devices, readers forpersonal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature (andSection;17.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agency is not required to provide eyeglassesor hearing aids to applicants or participants in its programs. Similarly,the regulation does not require the agency to provide wheelchairs to personswith mobility impairments. Paragraph (b) requires the agency to provide information, as appropriate,to individuals with handicaps concerning accessible services, activities,and facilities. Paragraph (c) requires the agency to post signs at inaccessible facilitiesthat direct users to locations with information about accessible facilities.Section 17.170 Compliance Procedures Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (l) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the agency will process employmentcomplaints according to procedures established in existing regulationsof the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). Paragraph (c) vests responsibility for the implementation and operationof this section in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for DepartmentalFinance and Management. Paragraph (d)(1) is adapted from the compliance procedures of the Departmentof Justice's regulation implementing section 504 for its federally conductedprograms and activities (28 CFR 39.170(d)(1)(i). It provides that complaintsmay be filed by a person who alleges that he or she has been subjectedto discrimination prohibited by this part or that he or she is a memberof a class of persons subjected to discrimination, or by an authorizedrepresentative of such a person. This paragraph prevents third partiesfrom filing generalized complaints where there has been no harm to a particularindividual or individuals. The agency is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints(andSection; 17.170(d)). If it determines that it does not have jurisdictionover a complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonableefforts to refer the complaint to an appropriate entity of the FederalGovernment (andSection; 17.170(e)). Paragraph (f) requires the agency to notify the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a buildingor facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed,or altered in a manner that does not provide ready access to and use byindividuals with handicaps. Paragraph (g) requires the agency to provide to the complainant, in writing,findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if noncomplianceis found, and notice of the right to appeal (andSection; 17.170(g)). Oneappeal within the agency shall be provided (andSection; 17.170(i)). The appealwill not be heard by the same person who made the initial determinationof compliance or noncompliance. Paragraph (l) permits the agency to delegate its authority for investigatingcomplaints to other Federal agencies. Under this paragraph the agency mayhave any required investigation performed by a nongovernment investigatorunder contract with the agency. However, the statutory obligation of theagency to make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance maynot be delegated. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 17 </ITAG>Blind, Buildings, Civil Rights, Employment, Equal employment opportunity,Federal buildings and facilities, Government employees, Handicapped.For the reasons set forth in the Preamble, Subtitle A of Title 31, Part17 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="6">David M.
