(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A junior officer who ignored advicefrom a lower-ranking navigator was to blame for the Januarygrounding of the Navy destroyer USS Spruance on a reef off theBahamas, a Navy report says.   The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville published the reportTuesday after obtaining it through a Freedom of Information Actrequest. The report contains the final results of the Navy'sinvestigation.   ``The grounding of Spruance was not an act of God, was not dueto equipment failure and was not the result of bad weather,'' thereport said.   ``It was caused by a combination of personnel errors andmisjudgments which, when compressed into a short period of time,created a situation that put Spruance aground.''   Though the Mayport-based Spruance was performing maneuvers withanother ship and a submarine, neither the ship's commanding officernor the executive officer was on the bridge when the 7,800-ton shiphit bottom, the report said.   Shortly after the accident, the Navy removed Cmdr. Travis W.Parker Jr. as the ship's skipper and reassigned the executiveofficer, Lt. Cmdr. J.M. Braeckel. The junior officer in commandwhen the grounding occurred, Lt. W.T. Hicks, was discharged fromthe Navy.   The Spruance's hull, propellers, sonar dome and forward mastwere damaged in the accident and required $1.4 million in repairs.   The Spruance was preparing to join an anti-submarine warfareexercise with the guided-missile frigate Boone and thenuclear-powered submarine Atlanta off Andros Island in the Bahamaslast Jan. 15.   In the late evening, Hicks, in command on the bridge, ordered aseries of course and speed changes to proceed with the rendezvous.The destroyer was just over a half-mile off the reef when themaneuvers began.   When Hicks considered a course change that would move the shipcloser to the reef, the report said he was advised against it byPetty Officer 1st Class E.G. Yeargin, a quartermaster. Anotherofficer, Lt. j.g. J.S. Lindgren, agreed.   Hicks ordered the course change but agreed to slow the ship tojust over 3 mph. He then ignored four recommendations from Yearginand Lindgren to change course to avoid the reef, according to thereport.   An officer and an enlisted man in the ship's combat informationcenter then recommended another course change to expedite therendezvous, but that would have led the ship ``directly through theshoal water,'' the report said.   Yeargin objected and demanded a course change, but Hicks ignoredhim again. Four minutes later, the ship ran aground.   Among other findings, the report found that charts used aboardthe Spruance had not been properly updated and reefs were nothighlighted as they should have been.   In addition, the report faulted the Spruance's staff for failingto calculate the effects of rough seas on the ship at slow speeds.</TEXT></DOC>
