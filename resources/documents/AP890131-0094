Working families with children and incomes of up to $18,576 mayqualify for a portion of the earned-income tax credit. If theyqualify, their tax bills could be wiped out completely _ and theycould get a check even if they owe no tax.   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-profitWashington-based organization that keeps an eye on federal actionsaffecting low- and middle-income Americans, is coordinating a driveto educate potential recipients of the credit. The campaign is beingunderwritten by organized labor, the U.S. Catholic Conference, theConference of Mayors and other groups as diverse as PlannedParenthood and Vietnam Veterans of America.   ``We are concerned that millions of low-income working familieswith children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned,''Robert Greenstein, director of the center, told reporters.   The 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit, making it available tomore families. At the same time, the new law eliminated as many as 6million poorer people from the tax rolls altogether, meaning theydon't even have to file a federal tax return.   However, they must file a return in order to receive theearned-income credit. Greenstein and his coalition are distributingfliers, radio commercials and other educational material that spellsout the credit and how to obtain it.   ``We think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled tothese benefits don't obtain them,'' said Kenneth Young, executiveassistant to the president of the AFL-CIO.   Sharon Daly, director of social policy for the CatholicConference, said the nation's 189 dioceses will be asked to placeinserts in church bulletins and lead community discussions to ensurethat poor families are informed of the credit.   As many as 11 million families are eligible for the credit, whichwas enacted in 1975 to provide a bonus that was aimed at keepingthem off the welfare rolls. The benefit was designed essentially tooffset a significant part of the Social Security taxes paid by thepoorest workers.   The credit begins declining after family earnings exceed $9,840;it disappears once income hits $18,576.   The credit cancels out up to $874 of a family's tax bill. If thefamily owes no tax, the credit is ``refundable'' _ that is, it canexceed tax liability. Thus, if a family owes no tax, the governmentwill mail a check for up to $874.   Greenstein pointed out that workers who qualify for the creditmay be able to get it in advance in their paychecks through theyear. Too, those who qualified for the credit in the past but didnot file for it may be able to collect retroactive payments for thepast three years.</TEXT></DOC>
