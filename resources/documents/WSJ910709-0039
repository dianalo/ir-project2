U.S. district judge Vaughn Walker set a deadline of Jan.31, 1992, for the three parties to complete most legaldiscovery in the case. Apple is accusing Microsoft Corp. andHewlett-Packard Co. of illegally copying critical portions ofthe screen display for its Macintosh computer.</LP><TEXT>   The decision reflects some frustration on behalf of JudgeWalker, the third federal judge to handle the case. Moreimportant, completing discovery will clear the way for thethree-headed dispute to resolve itself, either through atrial or through a series of legal motions.   &quot;If it goes on any longer, it is going to make sense forsomeone to make a tender offer for all three companies,&quot; thejudge quipped at a hearing yesterday, noting the cloud thatthe charges the companies have leveled at each other has putover their stocks.   The decision is at least a minor blow to the defendants.Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard had sought to continuediscovery -- swapping of internal documents, depositions ofcompany officials, and the like -- for at least a year. Applehad argued for an end-of-November cutoff. Judge Walker set ageneral Jan. 31 deadline and said he would allow depositionsof expert witnesses until Feb. 28.   Judge Walker also said he was inclined to dismiss a claimagainst Apple by Hewlett-Packard under the Sherman Act.Hewlett-Packard claimed that Apple's decision to bring suitwas part of an attempt to illegally monopolize the market forgraphical computer interfaces. The theory had the moralsupport of many independent software developers who haveconsidered Apple's use of the courts an attempt to limit theindustry's unfettered development. Apple's contention in thesuit is that its original work was stolen.   But Judge Walker said he felt Hewlett-Packard's antitrustclaim was &quot;most unimpressive&quot; and a &quot;big sideshow&quot; to thecentral issues of copyright infringement. While not formallydismissing the claim, he said he would at least defer ituntil the copyright issues are resolved.   At the same time, the judge indicated that he would allowMicrosoft to pursue a claim against Apple for allegedlybreaking a 1985 promise not to sue it over the visual-displayissue. Apple vowed to vigorously contest the claim.   Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have contended that Apple'sargument about the Macintosh interface is basicallyindefensible because much of the work was licensed betweenthe companies, wasn't original to Apple or else involvedfunctions that copyright laws don't protect. Even Appleconcedes that certain features of the Macintosh were derivedfrom work of Xerox Corp. researchers.</TEXT></DOC>
