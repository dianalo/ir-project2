But his chances of success depend on how Nigeria handles its multibillion-dollar international debt load.    Mr. Trefgarne sells something that could be called &quot;sovereign junk.&quot; On Wall Street, junk bonds are high-yield corporate debt that is below investment grade. In Mr. Trefgarne's case, sovereign junk refers to securities backed by Central Bank of Nigeria promissory notes.    Nigeria is struggling to restructure its international debt of about $18.5 billion. To postpone paying for certain imports with scarce foreign currency, the central bank started issuing promissory notes in 1985. Officially, the notes can be converted to Nigerian naira, for use only in Nigeria. But in practice, the central bank rarely allows conversions, and when it does, the exchange rate must be negotiated each time.    In response to this situation, Mr. Trefgarne, a 43-year-old British businessman, began last month to sell tradeable securities backed by a pool of promissory notes. The securities have a face value of $1,000 each, but he has discounted them to $335 -- in case Nigeria doesn't pay its debt.    That's where the risk lies. In January, Nigeria for the first time missed a $25 million interest payment on the promissory notes and other short-term debt. Investors in Mr. Trefgarne's securities in effect are betting that Nigeria will resume paying interest on the notes soon and will redeem them in about six years. &quot;I tell investors to treat it in their portfolios as an equity,&quot; he says.    The sovereign junk is &quot;a purely speculative instrument,&quot; Robin Saunders, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Ltd., a London-based unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., New York, says.    &quot;Nobody's going to take a punt on this unless they have some connection with Nigeria,&quot; Stephen Koltes, head of the junk bond section at Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd., says. &quot;A large institution is unlikely to buy it. There's no diversification. It's a one-shot piece of paper.&quot;    Those two bank units are among the London financial concerns that are trading the notes. Others include the First Interstate Ltd. unit of Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. and Britain's Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. and Singer andamp; Friedlander Ltd.    Mr. Trefgarne concedes that investor response to last month's issue has been &quot;mixed&quot; at best. But if the sale succeeds, it could help solve one big problem with the Nigerian promissory notes: They're difficult to trade. The notes range in amounts from $200 to several million dollars each and can be transferred only once to one of 500 banks world-wide.    Sovereign Assets Ltd., Mr. Trefgarne's Bahamas-based company, solved the notes' liquidity problem by pooling them in a bank trust fund and issuing the securities against that collateral.    &quot;The idea is that the investor has only one risk&quot; -- that Nigeria won't pay off the notes, says Mr. Trefgarne, who spent 10 years as a director and then chairman of a Nigerian electricity company. &quot;Nigeria is an infuriating country to deal with, but when you know it, you have a high degree of confidence that it will eventually repay.&quot;    Last December, Sovereign Assets and London stockbrokers Robert Wigram andamp; Co. invited holders to tender their Nigerian notes. Mr. Trefgarne was ready to accept as much as $125 million, but even after extending its deadline, the company received a mere $2.5 million of the notes at an average price around 31% of face value.    Fursecroft Trading Ltd. of London, which sells British consumer products in Nigeria, tendered all its $1.2 million of the notes. &quot;We feel it's worthwhile,&quot; Aba Dunner, a Fursecroft director, says. &quot;As we wait, the notes are getting less valuable,&quot; and Nigeria may start adding the interest to its total foreign debt.    Big holders stayed away, apparently either because they hadn't heard about the offer or because the price was too low. &quot;In principle, we'd be open to the idea of selling our notes, but the going rate is around 40% of face value,&quot; John Emberton, finance manager for Africa at Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, says.    The securities aren't underwritten, so sellers of the notes will get their cash as the securities sell. Bankers at three London institutions suspect that the biggest buyer will turn out to be the Central Bank of Nigeria, as the sovereign junk represents a cheap way to retire its debt.    Mr. Trefgarne denies this, insisting that &quot;the buyers are not the Central Bank of Nigeria (nor) anyone acting for them.&quot; Officials of the bank say they weren't even aware of the offering. Despite the slowness of sales, Mr. Trefgarne says tentative inquiries from potentially big investors and some speculators prompted him to extend the offer to March 13.    Although the offering amounts to a minuscule fraction of Nigeria's foreign debt, Mr. Trefgarne has visions of expansion. Companies and banks around the world already hold about $1.5 billion of the promissory notes, and Nigeria is expected to issue $3 billion to $4 billion more.    Beyond Nigerian debt, Mr. Trefgarne says, looms the prospect of turning Latin American countries' debt into securities. &quot;These units are similar to junk bonds, but that hasn't been done before with developing-country debt,&quot; he says. &quot;If it catches on, you could just take LDC (less developed countries') debt and put it to investors -- at the right price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
