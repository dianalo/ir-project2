Codrescu needed a cigarette. Desperately.He looked longingly at an ashtray the staff had thoughtfully placed in frontof him, but only as a prop. He had been warned not to smoke in politicallycorrect Berkeley where guilty smokers are subject to a citizen's arrest.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MY DINNER WITH ANDREI CODRESCU  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  T.T. Nhu's column appears each Friday on the Feature Page.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Codrescu extracted himself from his admirers, kissing with considerablefeeling a handsome African-American woman and a sensible-looking brunette,friends from his days as a starving poet in the Bay Area 20 years ago.;   &quot;Does anyone have a cigarette?&quot; he asked urgently as we repaired to a nearbyThai restaurant.;    Compact and ebullient, with owlish round glasses and ahip little pony tail, Codrescu was outfitted in what Europeans often wear whenin American disguise: leather and denim.;    Listening to this man who loveswords as much as he savors women, I can see why he found radio the ultimateoutlet for his deliquescent torrent. He's a very polished raconteur.;    Therewas no smoking and nothing interesting to drink at the restaurant. All thatdisappointed the poet who joked that he hadn't realized what a moral issuecigarettes had become.;    I asked him about his first day in America. Hearrived in Detroit on a freezing gray day in March 1966, speaking no Englishand not knowing a soul. &quot;I had the good luck of coming to America when I was19 and this country seemed to be about 19,&quot; he laughed.;    Coming of age inAmerica, assisted by &quot;a large steady dose of LSD&quot; made Codrescu into what hecalls a &quot;deliberate American.&quot; While I saw him as very European -- hisfondness for smoking, liquor, passionate conversation and his Rabelaisianhumor, so unlike his ascetic California intellectual counterparts -- Codrescufeels emphatically American.;    He likes the sense of space and openness ofthis country. &quot;When I'm in Europe I feel oppressed and crowded by Europeanmanners. I want to break out and be rude and lazy. I like that sprawl that isAmerica.&quot;;    Codrescu keeps up his Transylvanian staccato through weekly&quot;accent maintenance&quot; phone calls to his mother who lives in Florida (&quot;Whereelse does a Jewish mother live?&quot;). It makes me hear English as if for thefirst time.;    Codrescu has achieved at least a certain level of fame inAmerica, a situation he finds amusing but completely deserving. Propelled intocelebrity and the bourgeois life after years of living on the edge, he'sremains the unreconstructed adolescent, still filled with wonder and boyishenthusiasm.;    &quot;At this point in my life, I feel probably more American thanRomanian,&quot; he said. &quot;I've spent half of my life over there, half over here.The half I spent over there is probably longer because I was a child, and, asyou know, time is longer for children. But the part I spent here made me anAmerican in all my adult relations in this world.&quot;;    I'm especiallyinterested in this business about being a deliberate American, because after32 years in America, I sometimes feel like a foreigner. Codrescu, on the otherhand, is completely unequivocal about his allegiance.;    He's the mostexuberant American I've ever met despite that Draculean accent. And now he'sbecome a kind of national icon -- albeit on FM radio.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  T.T.
