ATandamp;T said Friday its interstate long-distance rates will drop by$637.5 million annually, for a 1.9 percent overall reduction in itsresidential and small business prices. MCI Communications Corp.said Thursday it would cut its rates by $200 million a yearstarting today.   The cuts represent a pass-along to customers of savings thatresult from a Federal Communications Commission order that localcompanies cut the charges to the long-distance carriers forconnecting with local phone systems.   The local companies had proposed a $489 million cut, but the FCCordered them last week to cut back by $705 million.   But the savings also reflect a 30-cent increase in the chargethat customers pay to help maintain the local telephone networks.That increase is effective today as well.   And while most long-distance rates will go down under the newrates, prices for basic long-distance calls under 292 miles willincrease an average of 4.5 percent. That's a change from ATandamp;T'sproposed 4.7 percent price increase in February.   Also, daytime price cuts will be larger than evening price cuts,4.2 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively; and night-weekend priceswill drop 0.3 percent.   Consumer groups had complained in February that ATandamp;T was notcutting prices significantly in the night and weekend long-distancetime periods used by residential customers, while making big cutsin the highly competitive daytime arena.   Under the new ATandamp;T rates:   _Basic long-distance prices will drop an average 1.9 percent.   _Rates for ATandamp;T WATS calls will drop an average 3.9 percent.   _PRO WATS rates will drop an average 3.9 percent.   _ATandamp;T MEGACOM WATS rates will drop 1.1 percent, and ATandamp;T MEGACOM800 prices will be 5.2 percent lower.   _Reach Out America will drop an average 2.6 percent.   _Basic ATandamp;T 800 service, down 0.9 percent; 800 Readylineservice, down 3.3 percent. Beginning July 1, ATandamp;T 800 service willbe billed according to distance, and there will be additional pricereductions of 1.9 percent for 800 service and 2 percent for 800Readyline.   _Software Defined Network Service prices will decline an average6.1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
