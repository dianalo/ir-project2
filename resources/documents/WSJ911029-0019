Avoice warns: &quot;Fuel economy is important, but safety isvital.&quot;   Yesterday, the commercial became the focus of an angrydispute between the Transportation Department and two publicinterest groups -- Public Citizen and the Center for AutoSafety, which are affiliated with Ralph Nader. The groupsaccused the department, which conducted the crash test shownin the commercial, of rigging it to buttress assertions thatpending fuel-economy legislation would compromise autosafety. The department emphatically denied the charges andsaid they were politically motivated.</LP><TEXT>   The fight is part of a continuing battle over fuel economy-- one that has featured dueling press conferences andconflicting technical reports and is escalating as Congressprepares to consider the legislation.   The commercial is paid for by the Coalition for VehicleChoice, a group financed largely by the auto industry. Thecar makers are worried about the costs of increasedfuel-efficiency requirements, and, along with theTransportation Department, argue that the fuel-economylegislation would force a sharp reduction in car sizes. Thecommercial began airing last spring, shortly after thedepartment sent dozens of copies of the crash-test videotapeto members of Congress and several organizations, includingthe CVC.   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, releasedgovernment documents showing that smaller cars actually didbetter than bigger cars in earlier crash tests conducted bythe department. She charged that the department withheldthose results, and that after the initial tests failed tosupport its position, Jerry Curry, head of the agency'sNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, deliberatelypicked a very large car and a very small car for the test toget the desired results.   She said the government further stacked the deck by notequipping the small car with an air bag. She also said thatthe department's data showed that the occupant of the smallcar featured in the crash might very well have survived theaccident, though that wasn't mentioned in the commercial.   Mr. Curry, clearly enraged, held a press conferencestrongly denying that the crash tests were rigged forpolitical ends and accusing the two groups of deliberatelymisinterpreting government crash tests. He charged thatClarence Ditlow, who is head of the Center for Auto Safetyand someone with whom Mr. Curry has often feuded, has &quot;nocredibility at all,&quot; but he declined to take a personal swipeat Ms. Claybrook, a predecessor of his at the safety agency.   Mr. Curry didn't deny that the department sent the tape ofthe crash test to the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, though headded he was &quot;a little surprised&quot; that the tape ended up inthe commercial. He said the earlier tests weren't released.   The two groups released portions of documents that thedepartment turned over to them in response to a Freedom ofInformation Act request. The documents indicate that beforethe tests were conducted, Transportation Secretary SamuelSkinner expressed interest in using crash tapes to illustratethe Bush administration's view that legislation to sharplyincrease fuel economy would compromise safety.   According to the documents, the Federal HighwayAdministration conducted tests last December in which afour-door Ford Taurus and a two-door Honda Civic were eachslammed into a pole. The tests apparently were an effort torespond to Mr. Skinner. The result, according to a departmentmemo released yesterday: &quot;Contrary to expectations, the FHWAtest results . . . indicate that the larger car was less safethan the smaller car.&quot; Mr. Curry said those so-called&quot;pole-tests&quot; weren't relevant because they aren't the propermethod for assessing a collision of a big car and a smallcar.   The documents also show that, as part of a separatetesting program, NHTSA conducted a head-on crash testinvolving the Isuzu Stylus and the larger Honda Accord. Thedata from the instrumented dummies indicated that &quot;the smallcar occupant was safer than the larger car occupant . . .probably due to the air bag present in the small car, but notin the larger vehicle,&quot; according to a memo.   Sometime after that test, Mr. Curry ordered the collisionof a 4,000-pound Ford Crown Victoria and an 2,300-poundSubaru Justy, and a Crown Victoria and a 2,000-pound SuzukiSwift. In both cases, the smaller car came out up badlysmashed up. But, according to the dummy data, the Swiftoccupant would have survived the crash, probably withoutserious injury.   The Justy's chest-injury score indicated that the occupantwould have been injured, but how seriously is in dispute. Ms.Claybrook said that occupant would have survived; Mr. Currythe occupant would have died. In any case, the tape madedramatic theater, and the Coalition for Vehicle Choice usedthe footage of the Justy-Crown Victoria crash in itscommercial.   Mr. Curry said he didn't want an air bag used in the crashtests because the smaller cars don't currently have them. Andhe took exception to charges that he meddled by telling hisengineers exactly what cars to test. &quot;That's baloney,&quot; hesaid. &quot;That's what I get paid to do.&quot; But he acknowledgedthat he did choose the cars to illustrate the effect of abig-car-small-car collision, partly to show Congress &quot;theeffect of downsizing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
