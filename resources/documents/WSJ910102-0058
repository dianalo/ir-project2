Politicians weren't waiting for the decennial censusnumbers simply for their effect on congressionalrepresentation. They were worried about money -- more than$27 billion of federal funding annually, dispersed through 93programs that use census data.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;For people in state and local government, these are themost eagerly awaited numbers of the decade,&quot; says KatherineWallman, executive director of the Council of ProfessionalAssociations on Federal Statistics. &quot;They not only give asense of who we are as a country and how we are changing, butthey also drive the resources that help us address changes inour society.&quot;   But when it comes to the census and money, nothing is assimple as it seems.   Though the nation's mayors and governors have beencomplaining that inaccurate census figures will jeopardizetheir ability to serve the public, the flow of federaldollars doesn't track as directly with population figures asthe handwringing suggests. Population is only one factor thatbureaucrats use to determine eligibility and spending levelsfor federal programs.   &quot;Common wisdom drives you to think that these censusnumbers control a lot more dollars than they do,&quot; says JohnKamensky, assistant director of the General AccountingOffice. &quot;They aren't the huge factor these mayors think theyare. A lot of these mayors are more worried than they need tobe.&quot;   The mayors are plenty worried. &quot;Each person who isn'tcounted represents a source of revenue for us,&quot; argues MayorMartha Wood of Winston-Salem, N.C. &quot;It's serious business.&quot;Jerry Abramson, the mayor of Louisville, Ky., adds: &quot;Censusnumbers mean an enormous amount to a mayor.&quot;   And while some politicians are arguing with the CensusBureau over relatively small population increments -- the30,000 people Detroit needs to remain above the one-millionmark and thus qualify for special state assistance, forexample -- a potentially much more significant statisticaldebate is brewing over population shifts that, in the case ofFlorida, are 100 times the magnitude of the &quot;missing&quot;Detroiters.   There is increasing concern that in states such as Floridaoutdated population data from the decennial census is beingused to allocate too big a portion of federal spending laterin the decade. &quot;A lot of these rapidly growing sunbelt statesare hurt when the federal government uses old populationfigures,&quot; says Candis Penn, executive director of theSouthern Governors Association. Indeed, old data can cost alot in federal aid when a state such as Florida grew by 3.3million people in the course of the last decade.   The decennial data being spewed from the Census Bureaucomputers right now is a factor in determining more than $17billion of the $27 billion in census-pegged federal spendingannually. More timely census data, some estimated annually oreven monthly, is used to help determine an additional $10billion of federal spending annually.   The difference can be significant in states like Arizona,which grew more than a third in the past decade, orCalifornia, which grew by more than a quarter. &quot;It's fairlysimple: In states where the population is growing quickly,the older the data, the bigger the penalty,&quot; says JosephWestphal, executive director of the Congressional SunbeltCaucus.   Sen. Connie Mack (R., Fla.) is drafting legislation toforce the federal government to use current estimates ofurban, rural, farm and below-poverty populations. Thischange, which would require amending more than two dozenstatutes, would have the biggest effect on transportationprograms, forcing changes in the distribution of $6 billionof highway and airport aid.   The Census Bureau argues that its mistakes in thedecennial are relatively small, that funding levels seldomare a function merely of population, and that some of themayors' complaints are overdrawn. &quot;If we were in the businessof making big mistakes, I'd agree with their complaints,&quot;says Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the census. &quot;Butsmall deviations are not going to have major impact -- or notas major as some people think. Some of this complaining ismisinformed.&quot;   If federal aid were distributed on a population basisalone, 42% of federal disbursements would shift among thestates, with 32 states losing federal dollars, according toestimates made last week by the Population Reference Bureau.The nonpartisan Washington research group found that usingsuch a direct population formula would mean that California,Texas and Florida would account for nearly three-quarters ofall the federal-funding gains.   But some programs have population thresholds, disbursingmoney in chunks rather than in amounts that grow gradually aspopulation grows. Several combine census numbers with otherfigures.   Education funding, for example, is based on factors ofage, income and educational achievement. Disbursement foradult-education funding is determined by the size of thepopulation 16 years old and over with less than a high-schooldiploma. Funding for educationally deprived children is basedon the number of children in families below the povertylevel.   That's why officials now are concentrating as much on thecomposition of the population that wasn't counted by the 1990census as on the size of that population.   &quot;There are problems when the people who are counted don'trepresent the people on whom these {spending} formulas arebased,&quot; says Evelyn Mann, director of the population divisionof New York City's Planning Department. &quot;Counting all themiddle-income people won't help if the people who need theseprograms aren't counted.&quot;   The big concern on Capitol Hill is that many federalprograms are directed at groups of people who were themselvesuncounted. &quot;There's a double whammy here,&quot; says Rep. TomSawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of the House census andpopulation subcommittee. &quot;If you're poor, you not only don'tget counted, you lose dollars and then get under-representedin the political process. It's an awful deal.&quot;   These debates come at a time when money is scare at alllevels of government. Mayors are worrying that declining citypopulations may force cuts in services used by people beyondthe city limits. &quot;The urban population of Louisville may dropeven with a legitimate count, but the metropolitan area isstaying level or growing slightly,&quot; says Mayor Abramson. &quot;Theheart of this community is the city, and if the heart goes,so do the fingers and toes.&quot;   While politicians debate the accuracy of the census countand the application of the figures to funding formulas,population changes may be endangering many of the programsbeing offered to cities and states today. The census figuresalready have changed the size of states' congressionaldelegations and, once state legislators are finishedredrawing district maps, there will be fewer urban members ofCongress and more suburban ones.   That almost certainly will change not only the characterof the House but the nature of spending itself.   &quot;It's entirely possible there will be a big shift of moneyto follow the population migration,&quot; says Rep. Tom Ridge ofPennsylvania, ranking Republican on the census subcommittee.&quot;There is going to be a substantial shift of dollars fromcity to suburb.&quot;   ---                    Applied Mathematics                                                                                                          Data from the Census Bureau will be used to determineeligibility for scores of programs administered by thesefederal agencies.
