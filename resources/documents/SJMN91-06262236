It also was supposed to save the county $16 million a year.;  Agretelis' ruling could have dramatic consequences because the county's $1billion budget, passed this summer, took those anticipated savings intoaccount.;   The ruling was a big victory for recipients of general assistance,a county-funded program for single adults who don't qualify for any other formof public assistance.;   Recipients and their advocates complained that thecounty's move treated them like children and unfairly limited their ability tobudget how their grants were spent.;   Recipients were particularly criticalof a $19 monthly allowance for clothing and transportation.;   Evelyn Frank,an attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County, branded the amount&quot;absurd&quot; and said it was unfair that recipients couldn't shift any unspentfunds from their $340 monthly allotment.;   She said one general-assistancerecipient she knows is a janitor who spends $60 monthly getting to and fromhis job. Under the county's new program, he might not have been able tocontinue working, she said.;   Pat Englehard, assistant director of thecounty's Social Services Agency, said her agency likely would come back withanother vendor pay plan.;   Supervisor Don Perata said such a plan must bedeveloped quickly.;   &quot;Every day we delay is money we're going to have to findfrom another source,&quot; he said. &quot;It just makes a bleak environment evenworse.&quot;;   But Frank was skeptical that such a program would be developed. &quot;Ithink it might be so administratively complicated that they may not bother,&quot;she said.;   General-assistance rolls have more than tripled in the past fiveyears, with the program's costs quadrupling.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ABBY COHN, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910918  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  423  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 18, 199100262236,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
