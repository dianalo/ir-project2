John C. Bedrosian, senior executive vice president, toldinvestors in Phoenix, Ariz., that the company expects toreport fully diluted earnings of about $1.60 a share based onabout 170 million common shares outstanding for the fiscalyear, rather than the recently revised estimates of about$1.70 a share expected by many Wall Street analysts. For thefiscal year ended May 31, 1991, the company reported netincome of $272.4 million, or $3.03 a share, fully dilutedbased on 80 million shares outstanding. The company paid a2-for-1 stock split in September.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bedrosian also said fully diluted per-share earningsfor the second fiscal quarter ending Nov. 30 are expected tobe up slightly from the 37 cents reported a year earlier.   The news caused the company's stock to drop $1.625 to$13.375 on heavy volume in composite New York Stock Exchangetrading. The stock, which has traded at a 52-week high of$25.75, has been under pressure since allegations ofunethical or illegal practices arose in New Jersey, Texas andFlorida earlier this fall.   Although operating profits at the company's acute care andrehabilitation hospitals are above expectations, Mr.Bedrosian said, profits from the company's PsychiatricInstitutes of America facilities would be well below previousestimates. Analysts said patient days, a measure ofoccupancy, at the unit's Texas facilities are off 30% in thequarter, and are off to a lesser extent in New Jersey andFlorida.   The company has taken an aggressive stance since theallegations first surfaced, and disputed charges of unethicalor illegal activity as &quot;unsubstantiated.&quot; According tolawsuits filed in several jurisdictions, the company'spsychiatric hospitals are alleged to have paid &quot;bountyhunter&quot; fees for bringing in patients; held patients againsttheir will to cash in on insurance funds; and misdiagnosedsome patients to bilk insurers, among other things.</TEXT></DOC>
