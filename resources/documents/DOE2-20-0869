The reasons to reduce testing duration are obvious,because time not generating electricity is time not generating revenuefor the utilities. The latest proposed revision to 10CFR50 Appendix J,concerning integrated leakage rate testing (ILRTs), was supplementedwith a draft regulatory guide proposing yet another method. This paperproposes a method that includes elements of currently accepted conceptsfor short duration testing with a standard statistical check for criteriaacceptance. Following presentation of the method, several cases are presentedshowing the results of these combined criteria.</TEXT></DOC>
