<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0508 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention provides an energy converter, comprising a frame, a rotormounted in said frame, said rotor including a rotor shaft and vanes,and an element which can connect the rotor shaft to an energy-producingmechanism such as an electric generator. Each of the rotor vanes liesin a plane which extends through the shaft, and is comprised of a holderwhich is fastened to the shaft, at least one blade which hinges relativelyto the holder about a hinge pin parallel to the shaft, and a stop forsaid blade. The energy converter is disposed so that its rotor is fullyunder water. Screen plates between the blades or sets of blades locatedin side-by-side relationship in an axial direction prevent the waterfrom flowing along the active (closed) vane blades. One object of thisinvention is to provide an energy converter of the type described whichpicks up enough power from the water flow even if said flow has a limitedspeed. Another object is to provide such a converter for which the ratiobetween the energy conveyed to the energy converting mechanism and theenergy available in the flow is very high. 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
