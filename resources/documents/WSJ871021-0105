In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here yesterday, Ogilvy Group Inc., parent of the New York advertising firm Ogilvy andamp; Mather, accused Burger King of violating copyright law in a national television commercial for its breakfast bagel sandwich. The commercials parody the rock 'n' roll song &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.&quot;    Ogilvy claims that the song's composer, David &quot;Curlee&quot; Williams, granted Ogilvy exclusive rights to the song through August 31, 1988, for &quot;advertising purposes in the category of food products,&quot; but that he then licensed Burger King, too. Ogilvy explained that it had acquired its rights last June to advertise the Latta butter substitute (&quot;whole lotta Latta goin' on&quot;).    Ogilvy demands that Burger King, a unit of Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., be enjoined from running the commercials and pay unspecified damages. Ogilvy said the Burger King commercial hasn't aired in the past few weeks but apparently will resume in March.    Mr. Williams couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
