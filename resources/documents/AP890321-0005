But the front-runner seems to be ``Rain Man,'' the saga of anautistic savant kidnapped by his cold-hearted brother, which hasalready won the Directors Guild award for its director, BarryLevinson.   ``Rain Man'' had its problems before production. Dustin Hoffmanwas intrigued with playing a retarded man, gifted with a genius fornumbers. The role of the autistic man's brother, a schemingsalesman, was closer to Hoffman's age, but the actor heeded hisagent's advice after Hoffman and Warren Beatty's ``Ishtar''disaster: Don't put two middle-aged actors on the screen. HearthrobTom Cruise jumped at the chance to act with Hoffman.   Directors Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollackundertook ``Rain Man'' in succession; all three withdrew for variousreasons. The project soon began to look like one of those dreammovies that never get made.   Then Hoffman met Levinson (``Good Morning, Vietnam'') at aperformance of the Cirque de Soleil in Santa Monica, Calif. Levinsondirected ``Rain Man'' under schedule and $2.5 million under the $24million budget (including an estimated $5 million apiece for thestars). The film has grossed $126.1 million.   ``Dangerous Liaisons'' is another film with an unsettled history.The source material, Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel about sexualintrigue among French aristocrats, long had been overlooked by aHollywood that disfavored costume dramas. ``Don't give me anypictures where they write with feathers,'' Jack Warner is reportedto have once said.   When ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' became a hit play in London andNew York, Lorimar Telepictures bought the rights and hired theplaywright Christopher Hampton to write the script. The movie wasfilmed in France as Lorimar's fortunes were flagging. Also, MilosForman was shooting another version of Laclos' work.   After British director Stephen Frears had made ``DangerousLiaisons'' (the title anglicized for Americans), Lorimar sold out toWarner Bros. Despite fears the movie would be ditched, Warners hasgiven it a decent and slow release, hoping for word-of-mouthsupport. The gross after 11 weeks: $21.2 million.   The most controversial of the film nominees is ``MississippiBurning,'' a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964murder of three civil rights worker in Neshoba County, Miss. TheChris Gerolmo script, directed by Alan Parker, tells the storythrough the eyes of two FBI investigators, played by Gene Hackmanand Willem Dafoe.   ``Mississippi Burning'' was attacked by those who participatedand reported the 1964 Freedom Summer. Said author David Halberstam,who covered the story for the New York Times: ``Parker has taken aterribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it, turned itinto a Martin-and-Lewis slapstick between two cops. It's a badmovie: `Mississippi False.'''   ``It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it didnot show one black role model that today's youth who look at themovie could remember,'' said Myrlie Evers, whose activist husband,Medgar Evers, was murdered by white segregationists outside hisMississippi home in 1963.   Gerolmo, not an Oscar nominee, replied: ``I never understood thisto be Hollywood's `civil rights' picture. It's an exciting storyabout something important. You see our moral failures and greatness.It allows us to see America at its very worst and also to see peoplewho displayed great moral courage.''   ``Mississippi Burning'' (the FBI code for the case) drew mixedreviews, several awards and only fair business ($28.8 million in 13weeks).   ``The Accidental Tourist'' marks the third collaboration betweenactor William Hurt and director Lawrence Kasdan; they also workedtogether on ``Body Heat'' and ``The Big Chill.'' In the new filmHurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate totravel. His private life is torn between his estranged wife(Kathleen Turner) and an uninhibited dog trainer (Geena Davis).   While reviews were generally excellent, some criticized thepassivity of Hurt's character. ``What's wrong with the heroism of aman who has traveled two inches?'' Hurt replies. ``That two inchesis very profound.''   ``The Accidental Tourist'' has had a fairly good response at thebox office: $28.8 million in 11 weeks. But receipts have dropped offin recent weeks.   ``Working Girl'' gives top billing to Harrison Ford and SigourneyWeaver, but they are virtually supporting players to third-billedMelanie Griffith. She plays the central figure of Tess McGill, ashrewd, ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the CIA toclimb to the top of the corporate ladder.   The script bounced around 20th Century Fox until it reached MikeNichols, who agreed to direct. ``One of the hardest things for adirector to find in the '80s is a good story,'' he says.   ``Every actress in town wanted this part,'' says MelanieGriffith. ``You should see the script. I'm on every page.''   Because Nichols insisted on the little-known Griffith (``you cansee right into her feelings,'' he said), Fox paid big salaries toFord and Weaver to assure star value.   Though some critics twitted ``Working Girl'' as a fairy tale,most were favorable. Audiences agreed. The gross so far: $54.2million in 11 weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
