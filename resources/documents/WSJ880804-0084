The law, designed to eliminate loopholes and make insider trading punishable as a criminal offense, otherwise would not go into effect for nearly a year.    &quot;There's no mistake we're moving toward expedited enforcement,&quot; said the official, who asked not to be identified. He and spokesmen for the Finance Ministry's securities bureau were unable to confirm newspaper reports that the agency has decided to enforce some parts of the new law beginning Aug. 23. Other portions of the law would take effect later this year, according to some reports.    Government representatives refused to discuss what sections of the law might be chosen for speedy implementation or what revisions are being contemplated. </TEXT></DOC>
