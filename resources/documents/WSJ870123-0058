The dispute arose over the rates charged for shipping coal from the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana to San Antonio. The ICC said in a brief statement that the settlement follows a commission decision last April ordering the rail carriers to refund about $40 million in excess transportation charges plus interest.    Under the terms of the settlement, the ICC said that the city and the railroads agreed to seek dismissal of a district court suit challenging the ICC's $40 million refund order, and also to seek dismissal of an unresolved portion of an ICC proceeding focusing on rates charged from 1975 to 1980.    In Seattle, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Inc., the railroad's parent company, said he believes the $111 million settlement figure includes the earlier $40 million refund. The spokesman said the company expects its unit to pay 74% of the settlement, with the balance to be paid by Southern Pacific.    The spokesman noted that Burlington Northern announced Monday that it took a $54 million coal-rate litigation reserve in its fourth quarter. The spokesman said the reserve was a major reason for the decline in fourth-quarter net income to $76.3 million, or 95 cents a share, from the year-earlier $120.8 million, or $1.46 a share. The $54 million reserve, along with previously reported reserves, should cover the company's financial exposure resulting from the settlement, the spokesman added.    A spokesman for Southern Pacific, a unit of Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., said the settlement ends a decade-long dispute with the San Antonio utility. &quot;We're glad to be done with it and get on to other things,&quot; he said. Although terms of the settlement weren't disclosed, he said it is based on the distance each railroad hauled the coal. He added that Burlington Northern shipped the coal from Wyoming to Fort Worth, Texas, with Southern Pacific handling the remainder of the line.    A spokesman for City Public Service of San Antonio said the utility will use the proceeds of the settlement to repay a loan and to buy fuel. Under the settlement, City Public Service will receive an initial payment of $31 million and the balance over a seven-year period. The spokesman said the rate-payers of San Antonio will see a slight reduction in their utility bills as a result of the settlement. </TEXT></DOC>
