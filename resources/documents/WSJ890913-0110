The chip, called the i960CA processor, will use superscalar parallel processing, in which a chip processes as many as three computer &quot;instructions&quot; at one time, the company said. Conventional chips only process one instruction at a time.    The attempt to develop that technology &quot;has been the four-minute mile of the industry,&quot; said Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. analyst Andrew Neff. &quot;It's what everyone is trying to do.&quot;    The chip also gives the Santa Clara, Calif., company a broader line of high-end chips. The i960CA chip &quot;is very important for Intel,&quot; said Mr. Neff, because &quot;it allows them to address markets they weren't positioned to address before.&quot;    With the chip, Intel has targeted a fast-growing market for 32-bit chips called embedded microprocessors. Unlike conventional microprocessors used in desktop computers, which can be reprogrammed, embedded chips are preprogrammed to be the &quot;brains&quot; of specific devices. Slower eight-bit and 16-bit embedded chips are often used in equipment such as video recorders and floppy-disk drives.    The new 32-bit chip, which can process 66 million instructions a second, could allow devices such as laser printers, navigational computers in airplanes and medical instruments to operate much faster than they could with older embedded microprocessors.    &quot;That market is just coming into its own. There's going to be a lot of opportunity,&quot; said Alice Leeper, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market-research firm. The 32-bit chip market will be $3.3 billion in 1993, according to Dataquest, up from $835 million last year. The majority of that market will be for embedded chips like Intel's i960CA, she said. Intel's parallel-processing technology allows the chip to look ahead at a series of instructions that are flowing toward it. The chip picks groups of instructions that can be executed at the same time, rather than processing each instruction in the order it arrives.    Intel has alluded to the chip previously as the third leg of its microprocessor strategy. Earlier this year, Intel unveiled its 80486 chip, a high-speed successor to earlier Intel chips that now power many of today's desktop computers. It also introduced the 860 chip, a microprocessor employing a technology called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel shares jumped $1.25 to close at $31. </TEXT></DOC>
