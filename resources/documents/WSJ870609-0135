His office in the basement of the Industry Ministry can't afford a new photocopier, or even enough pens. Moreover, last year he was unable to authorize any new trademarks despite more than 55,000 applications. The reason: For 16 months he hasn't been able to get the trademark-application journal printed.    His initial plan to have the weekly publication printed by a private company was vetoed by an undersecretary who said the government printer would be less expensive. But the state unit went on strike, and finally conceded that printing the weekly bulletin was too onerous, anyway.    After more than a year, Mr. Solanet reverted to a private printer. &quot;Bureaucratic delays and insistence on using a state company cost us millions,&quot; he says.    This example of state inefficiency typifies the enduring problems of the Argentine economy two years to the week after the launch of the Austral economic plan. To many, the program has run aground, marooned amid old problems still far from resolution.    &quot;The last year has been lost,&quot; says former Finance Minister Adalberto Krieger Vasena, &quot;because the fundamental problems of opening the economy and reforming the public sector haven't been tackled.&quot;    But fundamental changes are ruled out before Sept. 6. That's when President Raul Alfonsin's centrist government, which restored democracy in 1983, faces its stiffest test in congressional and gubernatorial elections. Already in trouble with military men who believe they have been unjustly abused for the &quot;disappearance&quot; of 9,000 people in the 1970s &quot;dirty war&quot; on subversion, the president is certain to delay politically sensitive changes.    &quot;We've entered what I call the September syndrome,&quot; says Emilio Cardenas, a company lawyer. &quot;This means that whenever I talk to government officials about privatization or foreign investment, they say they're interested but we'll have to wait until after September.&quot;    As a result, the president will be judged largely on the Austral Plan's achievements to date. Introduced in June 1985 with a wage and price freeze, it has tamed inflation -- but hasn't defeated it. Inflation was about 103% in the past year -- a respectable level for Latin America and Argentina's lowest for 12 years -- down from 1,000% when the program began.    Such progress has boosted the credibility of Mr. Alfonsin's government, whose avowed aim is to secure democratic stability after a half century of economic decline and military coups. Moreover, the fight against inflation has been bolstered by tough fiscal and monetary policies.    &quot;There's been a general tightening up,&quot; says Felix de Barrio, president of the Liquid Carbonic metals and chemical group. &quot;For example, we've stopped work on a $9 million construction project for the Atomic Energy Agency because the state wouldn't pay us. In the past, somebody would have released the money.&quot;    As a result, the public-sector deficit has dropped to about 4% of the country's gross national product, or total output of goods and services, from more than twice that when the Austral Plan was launched. Notoriously lax tax collection has been improved, and the central bank has curtailed its tendency to print money when needed. Some pressure has been taken off the economy by the recent refinancing of $32.8 billion of the country's $52 billion foreign debt.    But the team of economists headed by Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille seems paralyzed and reduced to constant stopgap measures and crisis fighting. &quot;People no longer believe in the Austral Plan,&quot; says broker Juan Prato, &quot;because they've seen that nothing really changes.&quot;    The Argentine economy, in the view of most analysts, remains closed and inefficient, weighed down by a swollen state sector and weakened by the reluctance of its industrialists to invest and compete. Attempts to sell off state industries, encourage international competition and rein in the country's strong labor unions have largely floundered.    Although growth of 5.6% last year is expected to be followed by an expansion of about 4% this year, GNP is scarcely above levels of a decade ago and foreign and private investment is stagnant.    The government economic team believes that Argentina's combination of bloated state industries and private oligopolies shielded from world prices and internal competition is a recipe for disaster. Combined with the continent's most organized unions pressing for higher wages, the situation invites high inflation.    &quot;Either we break these infernal mechanisms, become competitive and integrate with the world economy, or we'll live with controls for the rest of our lives,&quot; says Roberto Frenkel, a Sourrouille aide.    Breaking deadlocks, however, won't be easy. Two respected businessmen, Emilio Tanoira and Enrique Olivera, were put in charge of streamlining state industry by selling part of it off to the private sector. But Mr. Tanoira soon resigned and Mr. Olivera recently threatened to quit because he is getting nowhere. Giants like the state railway or Aerolineas Argentinas, and even the national oil company, continue to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.    But vested interests, union power, nationalist rhetoric and the deeply ingrained habits of cosseted businessmen effectively block change. &quot;Argentina has reached a kind of apoplexy of the state,&quot; says Adolfo Canitrot, undersecretary for the economy. &quot;The structure of our capitalism is geared to asking the state what it can give. But this state is broke. It no longer has money for anyone.&quot;    Such bold statements haven't been matched by bold action. For example, a long-awaited program of debt-equity swaps announced this month specifically excludes denationalizations from its scope, despite the fact that state companies account for about 23% of Argentina's foreign debt. &quot;The program could have been used to privatize some of these companies. In fact, that might have been one of the most effective ways to use it,&quot; says Charles Rowe, vice president of Bank of Boston's Argentine unit.    Despite this limitation, the debt-equity plan aims to bring in investments valued at $4 billion over the next five years. Under it, holders of Argentine debt -- currently trading in secondary markets at 58% of its nominal value -- can exchange their paper at par for local equity investments. It's seen by the government as a possible catalyst for opening the economy.    But Mr. Cardenas, the lawyer, believes the plan is &quot;timid and tight-fisted&quot; because of an insistence that one new dollar be invested in the country for every dollar of debt capitalized. &quot;Why not let the market determine what Argentina is worth?&quot; he asks. &quot;Maybe it would attract a fresh dollar for every dollar of debt swapped. But perhaps only 50 cents.&quot;    If, as still seems likely, President Alfonsin emerges from the election strengthened, he may feel he has the political clout to push through deep economic changes.    The alternative, in the view of Mr. Solanet and others, may be &quot;the asphyxiation of the state.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
