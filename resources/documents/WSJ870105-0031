After six years of a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, the Democrats again control both chambers of Congress, which heightens the opportunity for partisan sniping at the White House. But it also makes the Democrats, for the first time during the Reagan administration, responsible for shaping the policies that become law.    Congressional battles in recent years have been largely intramural squabbles between Senate Republicans and the Republican White House. But now, with the presidential elections looming next year, the Democrats must show that they can direct the course of legislation.    &quot;The spotlight now is going to move,&quot; says Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee. &quot;It's not going to be enough for the Democrats to stand up and complain. It's important for us to come up with solutions. We now have the challenge of governing.&quot;    Falling short in this endeavor could make it harder for Democrats to claim the big prize that will motivate much of what Congress does in the next two years -- regaining the White House. &quot;Failure to show we can govern,&quot; Rep. Gray says, &quot;could mean defeat in 1988.&quot;    Congress is likely to act quickly in ways that will cast it as an adversary of the White House. One of the first acts by both chambers will be to establish the special committees that will investigate the Iran-Contra scandal that has rocked the Reagan administration. The findings of those committees could set the tone for other legislative action on Capitol Hill for several months.    The lawmakers then will try to shove a water-pollution-control bill down the president's throat. Both chambers passed the legislation without a dissenting vote at the end of the last session, but it was vetoed by President Reagan, who said he wouldn't swallow its $18 billion cost. A belated attempt by the president to compromise doesn't appear to have slowed the drive. In addition, each chamber will pass its own version of a big-ticket highway bill that stalled in the closing days of the last session. The White House has threatened to veto the measure if it includes too many &quot;pork barrel&quot; projects.    But such muscle-flexing will soon be followed by some hard choices. Confrontations loom on big, nettlesome issues ranging from the budget to trade to arms control. The new speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia will have their hands full juggling the priorities without inciting a volley of vetoes from President Reagan.    &quot;The battle lines will be more clearly drawn,&quot; says Rep. Richard Cheney (R., Wyo.). &quot;The president will have his veto power and he may get some fat, juicy targets&quot; to use it on.    One of the earliest fights will be over how to reduce the federal budget deficit. A bipartisan consensus in Congress already appears to agree that domestic spending shouldn't grow much, if at all, and that military spending should, at most, rise only with inflation. The hard slogging, as always, is likely to come over taxes, with the Democrats apparently convinced that some tax increase is needed. But with the president still adamantly opposed, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee says he has &quot;not the slightest idea&quot; what will happen in 1987.    Partisan rhetoric might have to give way to solid action on the budget in order to clear the way for Congress to raise the nation's borrowing limit. The government stands to face defaults on the towering national debt unless the ceiling is raised by mid-May. But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) predicts that budget targets will be reached only by resorting to &quot;a bunch of smoke and mirrors.&quot;    Congressional leaders vow to send a bill designed to reduce the nation's other deficit -- trade -- to the president's desk this year. Democrats believe they can distinguish themselves with the issue, and portray their party as dedicated to creating jobs, by producing a bill that protects U.S. markets from foreign competition and opens foreign markets to U.S.-made goods. But the Reagan administration also is moving to co-opt the issue with a bill of its own.    The trade wars in Congress will be waged under the banner of &quot;international competitiveness,&quot; a buzzword that has the potential to be expensive for the American taxpayer. Besides insisting on retaliation against aggressive overseas competitors, the Democrats' trade bill also is likely to authorize expanded job-training and unemployment-assistance programs.    Another topic on which the Democrats view the president as vulnerable is arms control. Leaders in the Senate and the House plan to underscore what they call the president's shortcomings by reviving two test-ban treaties and by chiding him for his nuclear-arms buildup despite negotiated pacts with the Soviet Union.    Friction with the White House also is likely over efforts to pare back the explosion in farm-subsidy payments, to &quot;reform&quot; welfare programs, and to give financial assistance to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. But barring damaging disclosures from the congressional investigations, an expected vote in mid-February to block $40 million in aid already authorized is likely to fall short of the two-thirds majority that is needed to defy the president's wish to continue the support.    Other hot issues will include efforts to curb perceived abuses in the corporate-merger frenzy in light of the Boesky scandal, to beef up an ailing insurance fund for troubled thrift institutions, to curb the expansion of limited-service banking and to reexamine the breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Lawmakers also will face the tricky topic of raising their own salaries.    In addition, the Reagan administration is expected to propose a federal insurance program for catastrophic illnesses. The plan probably will serve as a catalyst for congressional action on the subject, and lawmakers will struggle to enact a law that, like the administration's, doesn't cost tax dollars.    At the outset, the new Congress will probably have to dispose of several conflicts among its own members. In the House, Rep. Marvin Leath (D., Texas) is challenging Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) for the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee. Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) might also face opposition to his chairmanship of the Banking Committee. In the Senate, Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) is expected to stave off an attempt by Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) to claim the position of ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee.    Presidential aspirants in Congress also will busy themselves taking positions on legislation in the hope of moving ahead of the crowded field for 1988. The potential contenders include Sen. William Armstrong (R., Colo.), Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.).    &quot;Someone has shaken up the pot,&quot; concludes Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), &quot;but no one quite knows what the final recipe will look like.&quot;    ---          The New Congress                                  99th                  100th       Congress               Congress  (adjournment) Senate Democrats        55             47 Republicans      45             53 House Democrats       258            253 Republicans     177            179 Vacancies       ---              3</TEXT></DOC>
