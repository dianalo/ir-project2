This is achieved in the thermionic generatorby several socket-shaped converters being fitted in suitable cut-outsin the jacket of a cylindrical carrier pipe made of ceramic, for example,placed in different planes at right angles to the pipe axis and displacedfrom each other. The converters are interchangeable, being separate,virtually identical components, which can be individually evacuated andprovided with individual sources of caesium vapour, and are held concentricallyaround a heat source on the carrier, which is fed by flames or focussedsolar energy. One bottom wall of each converter is turned towards theheat source, so that the emitter can be heated to a temperature betweenabout 1000 and 1400/sup 0/C on the back. In spite of the very close positioningof the individual converters, these do not interfere with one another,and due to the fixing of the converter in the carrier, which can be undone,and due to the possibility of removing the sleeve pipe, it is easilypossible to take individual converters out of the carrier and to replacethem by other converters.</TEXT></DOC>
