The agreement will effectively make Charter apublic company again.   The hospital chain also said it will enter bankruptcycourt with a prepackaged Chapter 11 filing once itsreorganization plan is accepted by creditors andstockholders.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement, Charter said, would eliminate about $600million of debt, including $118 million in annual interestpayments. Current holders of subordinated debt would end upwith about 93% of Charter's common stock. The remaining 7%would be held by the company's employee stock ownership planand by William A. Fickling Jr. and his family. Mr. Ficklingis Charter's chairman and president and currently owns about53% of the company.   When the restructuring is completed, Charter's remainingliabilities would total about $1.15 billion.   Wilbur Ross, managing director at Rothschild Inc. in NewYork and representative for holders of Charter's seniordiscount notes, characterized the agreement as an&quot;appropriate and fair deal&quot; that &quot;spared the company from afree-fall bankruptcy.&quot;   In January, Charter said it would move to restructure itsfinances to stave off default. Soon after going private in1988, the company, based in Macon, Ga., was hurt by insurers'efforts to reduce medical costs, particularly inmental-health services, which is Charter's primary business.   The company's leveraged buy-out &quot;followed the fashion ofthe '80s,&quot; said Mr. Fickling on Friday. &quot;At the time, it wasthe wise thing to do. {But} the industry changed on us. Wewere too highly leveraged.&quot;   In recent quarters, Charter has started to turn around itsoperations, offering alternative, and less-expensive, medicalservices to customers and sharply reducing costs. In itsthird quarter ended June 30, the company's net loss narrowedto $2.9 million from $40.7 million a year earlier.   The prepackaged Chapter 11 filing, Charter said, shouldgreatly expedite the company's restructuring. In most Chapter11 proceedings, a company seeks the court's protection fromcreditors while it devises a plan for repayment. In aprepackaged plan, the company already has developed ablueprint -- and secured the approval of at least 50% of itsbondholders holding at least two-thirds of its debt -- beforethe filing.   Minority holders can more easily thwart traditionalChapter 11 actions, which usually require approval of 90% ormore of each class of debt. But if the court approves theprepackaged plan, its terms are imposed upon the dissentingminority, and the company can leave bankruptcy much soonerthan the usual two or three years.   Officials at Charter declined to specify what percentageof bondholders had already agreed to the company'srestructuring plan, other than to say it was a &quot;substantial&quot;amount.   Charter officials said they hope to enter bankruptcy courtsome time around yearend and complete the reorganization bythe spring of 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
