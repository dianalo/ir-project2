Some of the items involved ultimately were shipped toIraq, which used them in artillery shells fired at U.S.troops during the Persian Gulf war, according to federalinvestigators.</LP><TEXT>   In a pair of indictments that lay out one of the largestand most complex financial fraud and arms-smuggling cases inhistory, a Philadelphia federal grand jury also accused thealleged mastermind, James Guerin, of laundering $700 millionover an 11-year period.   Mr. Guerin, once a charismatic kingpin in the world ofinternational arms merchants, was indicted along with nine ofhis associates on charges ranging from fraud and moneylaundering to tax evasion. The overall scheme was intended tokeep Mr. Guerin's corporate empire afloat and to inflate itsvalue, according to the charges.   As part of a smuggling scheme that earned untold millionsof dollars in profits, investigators and court documentsallege, some electronic components that Mr. Guerin'soperation illegally shipped to South Africa between 1985 and1989 ended up in Iraq.   Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett said that missileparts, gyroscopes and laser technology smuggled to SouthAfrica by Mr. Guerin's firm, International Signal andamp; ControlCorp., also are believed to have been transferred to Iraq.Customs officials said that ISC knew that South African firmshad agreements to supply Iraq with artillery fuzes, lasertechnology and other hardware.   Mr. Guerin's attorney, Joseph Tate, said his clientmaintains that he never shipped weapons or technology toIraq, directly or indirectly. Mr. Tate added that the U.S.attorney in Philadelphia acknowledged that the government hadno evidence Mr. Guerin knew of shipments to Iraq.   Nevertheless, Mr. Guerin previously agreed to plead guiltyto some charges.   Investigators said that Iraq tapped into South Africa'sextensive network of operatives in the U.S. and elsewhere toput together a systematic plan to illegally acquire Westerntechnology and military hardware. &quot;They built up asubstructure here,&quot; John Hensley, head of enforcement for theCustoms Service, told reporters. &quot;They got here early,developed a long-term plan {and} developed businesses&quot; tofunnel material back to Baghdad, he said.   According to the indictment, Mr. Guerin and his associatessmuggled more than $30 million of military-related equipmentto South Africa in violation of U.S. laws and a UnitedNations embargo. The material included missile parts,components for nightvision goggles, and optical equipment.   The charges against Armaments Corp. of South Africa Ltd.,two of its affiliated firms and seven South African citizensraise sensitive diplomatic questions the Bush administrationmay be wrestling with for a long time. Armaments Corp., whichis known as Armscor, is part of the South African DefenseMinistry. Current and former South African government andindustry officials remain under investigation by U.S.prosecutors. Senior Customs officials said Pretoria hasrefused to cooperate with the three-year criminal probe.   The charges are likely to prompt congressional demands fornew restrictions on technology shipments to South Africa.American companies already are barred from sending militaryequipment to the country because of the longstandingapartheid policies it recently renounced.   If the case ever gets to trial, R. Clyde Ivy, one of themain defendants and a former top aide to Mr. Guerin, islikely to claim that U.S. officials knew about the SouthAfrican deals. &quot;Basically, we believe that we had U.S.government approval on this,&quot; Mr. Ivy said in an interview.   However, Ms. Hallet, the Customs commissioner, said shewasn't aware of any formal or informal approval by U.S.authorities of illicit shipments by Mr. Guerin's companies.   According to the indictments, Mr. Guerin's allegedmoney-shuttling network comprised a global web of 48 frontcompanies, at least 61 bank accounts in the U.S. andSwitzerland, and a bogus set of books for the firms hecontrolled.   The grand jury said Mr. Guerin concocted more than $1billion in bogus contracts to inflate the value of his maincompany, ISC, and then relied on a flurry of phony orders,false shipping papers and other documents to disguise thescam. The contracts supposedly involved the governments ofPakistan, China and the United Arab Emirates, according tothe indictments.   Mr. Guerin sold ISC in 1987 to one of Great Britain's mostprestigious defense contractors, Ferranti International PLC,for about $670 million. The grand jury said that Ferranti wasdefrauded, buying a company whose value had been grosslyinflated. Mr. Guerin booked a phony $375 million contractwith Pakistan and paid $250,000 into a Swiss bank account fora Pakistani general who helped faciliate the scheme, theindictment said.   Mr. Guerin also developed close political ties in the U.S.A top consultant was Alexander Haig, the former secretary ofstate. Several persons familiar with the inquiry said hereceived $600,000 from ISC for helping sell cluster bombs toPakistan and weapons fuzes to China. But Mr. Haig wasn't atarget of the criminal investigation, and he cooperated withprosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
