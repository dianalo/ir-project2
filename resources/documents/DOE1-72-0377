<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0377 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have analyzed data obtained with the Deep River neutron monitor andthe underground vertical muon telescope at Embudo for the period 1965--79.Our data in conjunction with other published data show that for 1957--70the diurnal anisotropy is unidirectional; with direction along 18 hourLT (east-west). During 1971--79, the diurnal anisotropy consists of twocomponents. One is in east-west direction and the other is the radialcomponent, with direction along 12 hour LT. The latter attains a maximumamplitude in 1976. We find no evidence for the existence of the twentyyear wave in the diurnal anisotropy of cosmic rays. copyright AmericanGeophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
