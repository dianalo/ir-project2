The death of Yussef Mohammed Sbaith, 17, raised the number ofPalestinians killed to at least 320 since the rebellion began Dec.8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eleven Israelis have beenslain and more than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded.   An army spokesman said Sbaith was shot in the heart when troopswere stoned during a sweep of the West Bank village of Kafr Rai.   Soldiers also wounded a 22-year-old woman in the leg aftermeeting ``violent resistance'' from stone-throwing youths in thevillage, said the spokesman, whose name cannot be revealed underarmy rules.   Hospital officials said a 23-year-old man suffered head injuriesfrom a beating by troopers.   Army gunfire wounded 11 other Palestinians, including a14-year-old boy shot in the stomach, Arab doctors said. The clashesoccurred in the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, in the villages ofKabatiya and Beit Lid to the north and in Gaza City, they said.   An army spokesman confirmed six of the woundings, three in Nablusand three in Beit Lid.   Arab witnesses said two of the wounded were hit by bullets firedfrom the window of a house the army used as a lookout post in theopen-air Nablus market, the center of many clashes between soldiersand Arab youths.   Palestinians closed businesses and halted public transportationthroughout the occupied territories.   The underground leadership, which the Palestine LiberationOrganization supports, called the strike for the anniversary of therevolt in the occupied lands. Israel captured the West Bank fromJordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   Israeli military authorities clamped a curfew on the entire GazaStrip, confining more than 650,000 Palestinians to their homes. Thecurfew was announced on Israel television and over loudspeakers inthe area.   Despite the curfew, Palestinian youths shot red and whitefireworks in Gaza City to mark the anniversary of the uprising.   Residents of the old city also said people shouted ``AllahuAkbar,'' or ``God is great,'' a traditional rallying cry of Moslems.   The intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising used even by theIsraelis, has generated international sympathy and a new sense ofpurpose and identity among the 1.5 million Palestinians of theoccupied lands.   Throughout the Gaza Strip, Palestinians erected roadblocks andburned tires in sporadic acts of defiance Thursday. About 20Palestinian youths were seen lobbing rocks from a barricaded alleyin Gaza City.   A second strike is scheduled for Friday.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel television thatdealing with the uprising was ``a very uncomfortable mission'' forthe army.   ``This is a confrontation of mostly civil violence,'' he said.``Ninety percent of the incidents are concerned with rocks,roadblocks or burning tires. Only about 10 percent of the incidentsare firebombs, perhaps even less.''   In Amman, Jordan, a rally to commemorate the anniversary of thePalestinian uprising ended in a fist fight between members ofopposing factions.   Supporters of the Corrective Movement of the Palestine LiberationOrganization attacked people shouting slogans praising Fatah, themain PLO faction headed by Yasser Arafat. Atallah Atallah, who headsthe Corrective Movement, seeks to unseat Arafat.   No serious injuries were reported, but at least three Fatahmembers were thrown out a first-floor window.</TEXT></DOC>
