Hot weather makes dogs irritable and attacks on mailmen were upby 40 percent in the first six months of this year, the Post Officesaid.   A survey of the problem in the current long hot summer by TheTimes of London reported a mail carrier in Somerset was bitten onthe arm when a dog leaped through the window of his delivery van.   In Bristol, a mail carrier had a narrow escape when a guard doginside a house crashed through the glass front door to try to gethim.   There were 7,057 dog attacks on mail carriers in Britain lastyear, nearly one-fifth more than in 1987. Dog attacks cost the PostOffice $515,000 a year.   To stop them, the Post Office is testing a device that emits ahigh-pitched sound inaudible to humans but intimidating to dogs.   In the past, mail carriers facing a threatening dog were advisedto get down on all fours and look the beast straight in the eye. Fewwere brave enough to try, the Post Office said.</TEXT></DOC>
