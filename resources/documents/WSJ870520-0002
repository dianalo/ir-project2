Reed threw down the gauntlet yesterday to major bank competitors and big debtor countries alike by adding $3 billion to the bank's foreign and domestic loan-loss reserves.    It is a move laden with irony. Mr. Reed is leading Citicorp to accept the unpleasant reality of the huge, now-doubtful loans extended under his predecessor, Walter Wriston. It was Mr. Wriston who was widely quoted as espousing the view that &quot;countries don't go bankrupt,&quot; thus helping persuade smaller banks to get into the foreign-lending game.    Now, after taking over from Mr. Wriston in the fall of 1985, Mr. Reed is leading the way in acknowledging that loans to foreign countries can go very sour indeed.    Citicorp's latest move also is a huge gamble, laden with risk for many people. It forces banks with lesser resources to decide whether they should, once again, follow the lead of the nation's largest banking company. It may roil the financial markets for some time, as they weigh the uncertainty over whether other banks will take similar steps. It creates huge risks for Citicorp itself. It could disrupt the attempts by several governments, and especially the U.S. government, to defuse the Third World debt time bomb. And it complicates attempts to get banks all around the world to cooperate in meeting that and other international monetary problems.    But in Mr. Reed's view, the risks are worth taking. &quot;We think it significantly strengthens the institution,&quot; he said. By sharply increasing the bank's reserves against future loan losses to $5 billion, or 39% of the $12.8 billion in loans to its six biggest Third World borrowers, the action roughly puts the bank in the same position as that achieved in recent years by many major lenders in Europe and Japan, which have already increased their reserves. The bigger its reserves, the less vulnerable a bank presumably is to threats by borrowers to default on their loans. Thus, such a bank can be more aggressive in negotiating repayment schedules with them.    Indeed, some U.S. officials privately endorsed that argument, letting it be known that Citicorp informed the Treasury of its intentions two days earlier. But they made it clear that the initiative was Citi's alone.    &quot;No one asked us to do it,&quot; Mr. Reed said. In addition to regulators, he said he informed his major competitors shortly before the announcement. &quot;They understood our decision,&quot; Mr. Reed added. The move was taken after the Citicorp board yesterday reviewed the global economic situation and particularly the international debt problem. The bank didn't break down how much of the reserve would be allocated to foreign loans.    The sudden move, announced late yesterday, was presaged by a day of rumor in the New York markets. It means that Citicorp will report a loss of $2.5 billion for the second quarter and an estimated loss of $1 billion for the year after allowing for $300 million to $500 million in asset sales and other unusual gains. Last year, Citicorp earned $1.05 billion, or $7.13 a share. Total capital at year-end was $21.53 billion.    The addition to reserves roughly equals the reduction that Citicorp will eventually have to take in its troubled foreign debt, some experts think. &quot;That is close to what one has considered to be the market value for these kinds of credits,&quot; says Donald Crowley, a bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a New York bank-securities firm.    The Citicorp decision particularly increases the pressure on less well-capitalized U.S. banks with large loans to developing countries -- such as Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., which are expected to be hard-pressed to come close to matching such a move. A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover declined comment late yesterday.    Mr. Reed, who has established himself as something of a maverick leader, said Citicorp wasn't trying to set a standard for other banks. But that flies in the face of the past, when the big U.S. banks sought to act in unison on the foreign-debt crisis. After such a huge, unilateral move as Citicorp's yesterday, cooperation between the big U.S. banks will probably be much more difficult.    &quot;We don't believe everyone in the industry should do this,&quot; Mr. Reed said. He added that Citicorp's move won't alter its policy on dividends, which has been to increase them 8% to 10% annually.    By far the most vulnerable of the other major American banks is BankAmerica, which has been battered by huge loan losses since 1984 and has the lowest amount of equity capital among the top 25 banking companies. As of March 31, it reported $1.98 billion of sovereign loans outstanding to Brazil alone, and $1.39 billion to Mexico. If it were to establish reserves for the market value of Brazilian debt alone, it would report a loss of roughly $750 million, or 18% of its total shareholders' equity of $4.01 billion.    BankAmerica's very weakness may motivate regulators to adopt a lenient stance, allowing each bank to evaluate the same credits differently. But the markets will make their own determination, which will be reflected in the value of BankAmerica's stock and other securities. The ripple effects could include the sale of BankAmerica's big SeaFirst bank in Seattle, or renewed attempts to acquire the stricken giant.    But BankAmerica immediately signaled its determination to avoid further increasing reserves, at least for the time being. In a prepared statement, the company said its reserves &quot;are appropriate for the asset mix in its overall portfolio. We are aware of no developments which would produce a need for adjustments to this reserve.&quot;    Citicorp's move could pose problems for the Reagan administration if it undermines confidence in banks exposed to Third World debt or in the administration's debt strategy, which encourages banks to lend to developing countries in exchange for economic reforms -- the so-called Baker plan, named after Treasury Secretary James Baker.    But government officials were quick to interpret the move as a sign of strength, not weakness, on both fronts. They portrayed the Citicorp decision as an isolated one that was the bank's own idea, one that other banks need not follow, and one that will strengthen both Citibank's balance sheet and its ability to continue lending to the Third World.    Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman said Citicorp's decision was &quot;the appropriate thing for them to do under their particular circumstances. . . . Other banks have been and will be looking at their circumstances and reserving against it to the point they believe is appropriate.&quot;    Federal Reserve Board spokesman Joseph Coyne said yesterday's action was done &quot;entirely at Citicorp's initiative.&quot; Although Fed officials were advised of the bank's plans, &quot;it was their own judgment of what kind of reserve positions they should make,&quot; Mr. Coyne said. &quot;We don't consider this a precedent for other banks.&quot;    A key to the response of the other major American lenders will be today's reaction by the financial markets to Citicorp's move. If the markets react favorably, on the ground that uncertainty has been reduced, other banks will be encouraged to establish higher reserves. The stock market has already been assessing Citicorp and the other big LDC lenders for unrecognized losses on troubled foreign loans.    &quot;This will be the acid test,&quot; says Mr. Crowley of Keefe Bruyette. &quot;It could be positive.&quot;    But first returns were negative. With rumors swirling before the announcement, Citicorp stock dropped $1.625 to close at $50.625 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. After the Big Board closed, the stock slipped further to $48 bid in off-board trading, according to Jefferies andamp; Co., a Los Angeles firm that makes a market in issues listed on the Big Board.    However, both major credit rating agencies endorsed the Citicorp move and said the big bank holding company's debt ratings wouldn't be changed.    Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. called the decision &quot;a positive response to a deteriorating situation,&quot; adding that Citicorp &quot;is well positioned to restore earnings momentum and rebuild equity capital.&quot; And, it said, the move brings Citicorp's reserve protection &quot;more in line with international peers, restoring confidence in the integrity of its balance sheet.&quot; Sandamp;P noted, however, that the move will reduce Citicorp's equity capitalization by nearly 25% and &quot;create near-term funding uncertainties.&quot;    Moody's Investors Service said the move &quot;merely adjusts the financial statements to more accurately reflect economic reality.&quot; It added that Citicorp's debtholder protection and &quot;true economic capital remain consistent&quot; with the current debt rating.    Because federal bank regulators count reserves for loan losses as part of an institution's capital, Citicorp's maneuver actually could improve its position. By establishing a huge loan-loss reserve, Citicorp doesn't lose any regulatory capital and, if the reserve is sufficient, the banking company probably won't have to write off against its income any future losses on Third World loans. Its action is similar to a manufacturer writing off an old plant of little value as a loss so that it won't have to deduct allowances for its depreciation in the future.    &quot;It's a beautiful maneuver on their part,&quot; one observer says. &quot;It should improve their income very markedly.&quot;    A top Treasury official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, conceded that &quot;you may have a short-term problem&quot; if the press, other banks and the markets interpret the Citicorp action as a blow to the Baker debt strategy or to bank soundness in general. But he insisted that &quot;this sort of trend actually strengthens the banking system and strengthens its ability to participate in creative ways in new money packages&quot; for debtor countries.    Mr. Reed acknowledged that his bank's action &quot;could be misconstrued as a bargaining tactic, as a willingness to take a hit,&quot; but he added, &quot;it isn't. We aren't changing our {country-debt} negotiating policy, and we continue to support the Baker initiative.&quot;    Other officials said that Citicorp, in adding to its loan reserves, was merely catching up with European banks with similar debtor-country exposures and thus removing worries that it might be too exposed to conduct major new lending.    The top Treasury official said Citicorp had assured the government that &quot;they will continue to be international lenders, that they are in the international side for the long haul.&quot; He noted to the bank's public assurance of continued support for the Baker debt strategy and said &quot;the added reserves will allow them to do more lending to countries that are performing&quot; on their obligations.    The Treasury official said Citicorp's increase in loan reserves would provide a &quot;sobering reality&quot; for those developing countries &quot;that felt they had the banks on the hook.&quot; He predicted that Citicorp will become &quot;a tougher negotiator&quot; and that the move &quot;make it harder to muscle Citicorp.&quot; But he said that would be a problem only for debtor nations that aren't performing on promises tied to their loans.    Another Treasury official argued that, by increasing its loss reserves, Citicorp -- and any bank that follows suit -- is putting itself in a stronger position to demand reforms in countries to which it lends -- a key feature of the Baker plan. &quot;It may make them a lot more selective about whom they put money up for. And in a sense, I guess, we consider that good for the Baker plan. This increases the ability of banks to ask for conditionality. They can say, 'We're not afraid of you putting off paying interest for a while. And for those of you {debtor countries} who are willing to go down a certain path {to economic reform}, we stand ready to lend you more money.'    &quot;So on a selective basis, it increases the attractiveness of providing additional funds, by giving them a better negotiating stance. And I suppose that will also put additional pressure on countries to conform to it {the Baker plan}.&quot;    The way banks have handled foreign debt is controversial. Citicorp's decision crimps what the chairman of one major West Coast bank has termed &quot;the world's largest Ponzi scheme&quot; -- with banks lending new money to enable borrowers to service old debt.    The major American banks, led by Citicorp, argued throughout the 1980s that their troubled foreign creditors could restructure their economies and repay huge amounts of bank debt, if given additional loans and sufficient time. But since Brazil declared a moratorium on interest on its bank debt last February, a growing number of banks, regulators and analysts -- and the stock market -- have concluded that billions of dollars of losses are inescapable and will be realized over time.    The Citicorp decision raises the stakes in the banks' war of nerves with Brazil, the developing world's biggest debtor. Brazil recently suggested that it may extend its suspension of interest payments to cover all its debts to foreign governments, as well as its foreign-bank debt. Brazil and its creditor banks probably will begin debt talks later this summer, and Citicorp's move shows Brazil that, if necessary, the bank could afford to write down its Brazilian loans.    A small but expanding market in troubled LDC debt has steadily indicated that loans to troubled countries, particularly in Latin America, were worth at least one-third less than the value carried on the major banks' books. The stock market, in assigning big American banks extraordinarily low price-to-earnings multiples, has already assumed that there are billions of dollars of unrealized losses on their books. Many regional banks and large European lenders have reserved for most of their losses on such loans, but regulators until now have allowed the major American lenders to ignore their actions.    Citicorp fired a salvo on Third World debt earlier this year. In an interview with this newspaper in February, Mr. Reed put the world on notice that he wouldn't continue with his predecessor's softer approach to the debt crisis.    &quot;It's a crummy world out there,&quot; Mr. Reed said. On March 13, Citicorp said it might put its medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on a so-called cash basis, because of doubts about their collectability. Under this procedure, interest payments accrue to earnings only when actually received.    Several major banks got the message, and put certain Latin loans -- mostly Brazilian -- on non-accrual status. And in April, Citicorp put $3.8 billion of its Brazilian loans on non-accrual, slashing first-quarter earnings by $53 million.    Asked at a news conference yesterday how Citicorp's board arrived at the $3 billion figure, Mr. Reed said: &quot;Obviously, it's a judgment call; any number with nine zeros can only be approximate. We're clearly costing stockholders a year's earnings.&quot;    Although huge, the sum is a fraction of Citicorp's developing-country loans. In Brazil, it is the largest lender, with about $4.6 billion in loans. It has lent $2.8 billion to Mexico, $1.8 billion to the Philippines and $1.4 billion to Argentina.    In reply to a question at the news conference about how much of the reserve will probably be used to cover loan losses, Mr. Reed said, &quot;That's very flaky, very judgmental. Over three years we might use as much as a billion dollars.&quot;    Why did the 48-year-old Mr. Reed take this step now?    &quot;The marketplace has been marking down these bank stocks to extremely low levels,&quot; speculates Mr. Crowley, the Keefe Bruyette analyst. &quot;It doesn't believe the banks' earnings and balance sheets. What Reed is doing is facing up to that. Clearly, Reed, contrary to Wriston before him, has really looked upon the foreign exposure as a problem that needs to be faced straight on rather than finessed.&quot;    Mr. Crowley adds, &quot;Obviously, Reed is very young. He has another 20 years to serve at Citi. He can take the long view.&quot;    ---                      Biggest Bank Losses         Largest quarterly losses by commercial banks                                   LOSS                              (In millions)      QUARTER    Citicorp*                    $2,500         2nd 1987    Continental Illinois          1,160         2nd 1987    BankAmerica                     640         2nd 1986    BankAmerica                     338         2nd 1985    InterFirst (Dallas)             281         2nd 1986    InterFirst (Dallas)             249         2nd 1983    First City (Houston)            232         1st 1986    *Estimate   ---              A Look at Citicorp's Loan Portfolio        (In billions of dollars, as of Dec. 31, 1986)   LOANS                                        MONEY   AS A PERCENT DEBTOR           TOTAL   ESTIMATED      OWED  OF CITICORP'S NATIONS   FOREIGN DEBT   BANK DEBT  CITICORP* PRIM.CAPITAL# Brazil          $108.0       $77.3     $4.6          34.1% Mexico           100.3        76.7      2.8          20.7 Argentina         49.8        34.5      1.4          10.4 Venezuela         35.3        30.0      1.1           8.2 Philippines       26.7        15.0      1.7          12.6 Chile             21.4        14.8       .6           4.4   *Citicorp is the biggest bank lender to Mexico and Brazil,although some other U.S. banks have lent sums to thesecountries equivalent to a higher percentage of their primarycapital.
