At an emergency meeting of the group's monitoringcommittee -- a parley that lasted less than two days --members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesagreed to cut total production by 1.4 million barrels a day.But the reduction, which was supposed to send positivesignals to the market, instead caused the futures price ofcrude for June delivery to tumble by 69 cents a barrel.Gasoline and heating oil prices retreated as well.</LP><TEXT>   Market participants were somewhat disappointed that OPECministers didn't accomplish anything more than reducingoutput back to the official quota level of 22.08 millionbarrels a day established at last November's meeting. ByOPEC's own reckoning, current demand for its oil is less than21 million barrels daily.   In addition, inventories world-wide are burgeoning andstorage facilities are loaded to the brim, industry officialssay.   &quot;There was a reluctance to sell before the meeting in caseOPEC did something unexpected,' said James Fiedler, vicepresident for energy brokering at E.D.andamp; F. Man InternationalFutures Inc. &quot;There was always the possibility that OPECwould pull a rabbit out of its hat,&quot; as it has in the past.   Oil prices had initially rallied somewhat on news of theOPEC pricing pact. Particularly positive were reports thatthe United Arab Emirates, a flagrant violator of its OPECquota of about one million barrels daily, had agreed to slashoutput by 200,000 barrels a day. Industry experts as well asOPEC officials had pegged current UAE production at 1.9million barrels daily.   Howver, after the agreement had been struck, UAE OilMinister Mana Otaiba said that production by the Emiratesactually stood at 2.1 million. &quot;In just one sentence, Otaibatorpedoed the whole meeting,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, director ofShearson Lehman Hutton's energy desk in London. &quot;He wasproducing more than anyone, including OPEC, thought he was.&quot;   Industry officials and traders say they have little faiththat the cartel's members will actually rein in production.But OPEC ministers, cognizant of the doubts, say thatyesterday's price decline is only temporary -- prices willrise gradually in the weeks ahead as they honor theiragreement.   Also depressing oil prices was a report issued by the U.S.Energy Department Wednesday night. The agency estimated thatcrude oil stocks in the U.S. increased by 4.2 million barrelsin the week ended April 27. The American Petroleum Institutehad reported Tuesday that crude stocks during that perioddeclined.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices eased. The May contract was off1.10 cents an ounce to $1.2020. July declined 0.55 cent anounce to $1.1160. As a result, the May premium over July wasreduced 0.55 cent to 8.60 cents. The price decline didn'treflect any change in the current supply tightness, butinstead was influenced by softness in London caused by aLondon Metal Exchange examination of recent trading there,according to William O'Neill, vice president of research forElders Futures Inc., New York. The Metal Exchange asked allbrokers to turn their trading cards over to the exchange by 6a.m. EDT today, according to Mr. O'Neill; he said theexchange was looking into any trading beyond the bounds ofrules that might have affected the premium of the cashposition price over that of the three-months' delivery. OnTuesday, that premium widened sharply and then was reduced onWednesday, Mr. O'Neill noted. In Peru, mine and smelterworkers of Southern Peru Copper Corp. remained on strikedespite an order Wednesday signed by the Peruvian PresidentAlan Garcia ordering them back to work by yesterday. TheNational Federation of Mine Workers said that a meeting ofthe member unions took place yesterday and that the result ofthe talks would be announced at a news conference today. ANew York spokesman for the company confirmed yesterday'sunion meeting had taken place and that today's union newsconference was scheduled, but said that Southern Peru hadrepeated that the federation didn't represent the five unionsinvolved in the strike.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. June delivery goldwas up $1.70 an ounce to $373.70. July silver edged up 0.8cent an ounce to $5.0730. July platinum advanced $2.70 anounce to $483.20. Some support for gold came from a KnightRidder report that the International Monetary Fund wouldn'tsell gold for the next two to three years to make up fordefaults on loans by some member nations. The gold thesenations have contributed to the IMF as part of theirmembership will, instead, be used as collateral to back loansto these nations, according to the report. This alleviatedfears of gold sales by the IMF, as had been proposed by theU.S., an analyst said. There was also growing concern overthe increasingly unstable political situation in South Africaand the possibility of violence, the analyst said. The SouthAfrican Bureau of Mines' latest report indicated goldproduction in that country was up last month, but slightlylower for the first quarter than last year. Gold outputduring March amounted to 47,560 kilograms, up 4% from the45,724 kilograms in February but below the 48,733 kilogramsof March 1989. For the first quarter, gold productionamounted to 148,226 kilograms, down 1% from the 150,133kilograms a year earlier. A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed lower on profit-takingfollowing Wednesday's rally. The decline was also in responseto crop estimates released by a widely followedfutures-research concern, Sparks Commodities Inc., inMemphis, Tenn. Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 7.75cents a bushel to close at $6.44 following the release ofSparks's estimate of the Brazil soybean crop at 19.5 millionmetric tons -- higher than many other private estimates,futures analysts said. Heavy rains across many Braziliangrowing regions in recent weeks, while farmers were trying toharvest their soybeans, had led many analysts to predict areduction in the Brazilian crop. Wheat futures prices hadbeen higher early in the trading session on worries thatheavy rains in Texas and Oklahoma winter-wheat growingregions had damaged the crop. Continued expectations forimminent export orders also supported prices. But July wheatfutures finished the session down 0.75 cent at $3.4675 abushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in response toSparks's estimate of a bumper wheat crop this year. Sparks,which doesn't comment on its estimates, said the winter-wheatcrop would total 2.05 billion bushels and that the U.S.'stotal wheat crop would reach 2.72 billion bushels -- bothfigures being higher than those of many other analysts. Cornfutures prices, influenced by the action in the adjoiningfutures pits, dropped two cents a bushel for July delivery toclose at $2.87.</TEXT></DOC>
