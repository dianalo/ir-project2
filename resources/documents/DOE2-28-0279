Performance and costs are estimated from data on plants of varioustypes in operation in several countries or offered by makers. Size isfound to have very little influence on the specific investment cost overthe entire size range if one allows for the fact that small plants usuallycan be accomodated in existing buildings whilst larger plants mostlyrequire new buildings. Also maintenance costs per kWh are comparativelyinsensitive to size. Alternative projections are made regarding the salesprices for electricity from such plants at a time when the planned phaseout of nuclear power in Sweden is well on its way, and projections ofnatural gas prices at a time Denmark, Norway and Finland compete forthe Swedish gas market. For 'reasonable' projections within the priceranges studied some mini-cogeneration plants of all sizes studied wouldbecome competitive. Mini-cogeneration plant development trends are brieflydiscussed and outline suggestions for developing work in Sweden are made.</TEXT></DOC>
