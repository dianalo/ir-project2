Coca, which operates the Southern California mine, said the transactions will increase its share of the mine's net operating cash flow to 71% from 33%.    The mining concern said it bought an 11.3% working interest in the project from Coca's chairman, Thomas E. Congdon. In addition, the company said it completed repayment of $4.2 million to VentureTrident, a Denver venture capital firm that helped fund the mine. The repayment reduced VentureTrident's share of the project's cash flow.    VentureTrident, in turn, sold its 25% working interest in the mine to MFC Mining Finance Corp. of Canada, a Canadian mining concern, in exchange for MFC common stock valued at 12.2 million dollars Canadian ($9.3 million) to 14.1 million dollars, Coca said. </TEXT></DOC>
