<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1551 </DOCNO><TEXT>The experiment has been carried out by means of 100 cm hydrogen bubblechamber exposed to a polarized deuteron beam at 3.3 GeV/c. The estimateof vector polarization of the deuteron P/sub Z/=0.41+-0.09 was made fromthe analysis of azimuthal distribution of recoil protons in dp -andgt; ppnreaction. A significant difference has been noted in the azimuthal angledistributions between the recoil proton (direct channel) and the recoilneutron (charge exchange). The calculation of the recoil neutron distributiondo not agree with the experimental data. 16 refs.; 5 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
