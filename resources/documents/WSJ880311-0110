A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman confirmed that the $807 million figure is in line with the banking company's thinking and described the figure as &quot;very conservative.&quot;    The company, which posted a $1.1 billion loss last year, indicated it expects 1988 operating earnings to be at least $377 million, compared with $282 million in 1987. It also expects an earnings boost of $95 million this year from a restructuring that eliminated about 2,500 jobs, according to the annual report.    Manufacturers Hanover executives said they are confident that 1988 operating earnings would surpass last year's even without that $95 million gain. They say the quality of the bank's loans should improve from the troubled levels of recent years and that profit at the C.I.T. Group financing unit should improve from last year's $40 million.    Manufacturers Hanover made a $1.7 billion addition to loan-loss reserves in last year's second quarter, reflecting troubles with loans to Latin American nations.    In a letter to holders, Chairman John F. McGillicuddy and President John R. Torell said, &quot;While tax benefits and special gains will be essential to rebuilding equity in 1988, it is the renewed strength of our basic businesses that will make the major difference this year and in the years ahead.&quot;    The bank's earnings outlook could improve further if Brazil, which last year suspended interest payments on its foreign bank debt, makes up its arrears. Brazil and its major bank creditors reached a tentative rescheduling accord this month on $62 billion of the nation's debt. Last year, the loss of Brazil's interest payments reduced the bank's profit by $75 million after tax.    The spokesman declined to identify the assets the company plans to sell this year. Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's sixth largest banking concern, previously said it wants to sell its consumer finance subsidiary for $500 million to $600 million.    Last year's big addition to loan-loss reserves sharply reduced shareholder equity. The company since has been rebuilding its common equity position through asset sales, cost-cutting, a new stock issue and tax benefits. At year's end, common equity stood at $2.1 billion, or 2.81% of assets.    In their letter, Messrs. McGillicuddy and Torell said, &quot;Restoring common shareholders' equity to 4%, the ratio prior to the reserving action, is our overriding priority.&quot; To reach 4% of assets by the end of 1988, the bank would have to raise an additional $750 million of equity.    Securities analysts reacted positively to the bank's forecast. James Wooden of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said: &quot;I'm not surprised, and I am pleased to see it. This is part of the strategic vision that they outlined last fall at the time of their equity issue: Get rid of under-earning assets and non-core businesses and do everything that you can to supplement common equity. This confirms that they've got a lot of assets to sell.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
