Indeed, they vow the operator of 1,300 supermarkets will be a much more focused enterprise, led by employees who could own a 25% stake in Kroger after the restructuring. The company declines to say whether it is repurchasing shares for its employee benefit plans.    &quot;We'll have more motivation to succeed,&quot; says Chairman Lyle Everingham, adding that Kroger will have to be &quot;fanatical&quot; about curbing costs since the recapitalization will saddle it with an additional $3.6 billion in debt. Interest payments will soar to $680 million next year from $84 million in the year ended Jan. 2., adjusted for assets to be sold.    Mr. Everingham also said he was &quot;bullish&quot; about fiscal third-quarter results expected to be announced today. He said he was comfortable with analysts' estimates that earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 9 rose 13% to about $51.4 million, or 65 cents a share. Mr. Everingham also said sales in the quarter rose about 8.5%, in line with projections made with its recapitalization. Sales in the 1987 fiscal third quarter were $5.15 billion.    Kroger officials in an interview acknowledged a &quot;sense of achievement&quot; that their recapitalization plan thwarted a takeover bid from Kohlberg Kravis andamp; Roberts Co., a New York leveraged buy-out concern. But Mr. Everingham and Joseph A. Pichler, president, still aren't about to cheer an all-out victory. &quot;I don't know who's lurking in the closet,&quot; says Mr. Everingham.    Kroger, for instance, may still have to contend with the Haft family of Landover, Md., who put Kroger into play last month. The Hafts expressed a desire to provide Kroger with equity and help with its restructuring. The Kroger executives, however, say they haven't met with the Hafts and indicate they don't intend to.    On Friday, Kroger will distribute much of its equity to shareholders of record Oct. 14 in the form of a special $40-a-share dividend. The pay-out also will include a &quot;stub&quot; stock in Kroger with an &quot;intrinsic value&quot; ranging from $9 to $13 a share. The stub closed at $9.125, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. In the future, shareholders will also receive a junior subordinated debenture with an estimated trading value of about $8 a share.    The Kroger officials disclosed that during the takeover tussle, they considered a leveraged buy-out, among other options. But, they say, they wanted to offer employees and management a chance to &quot;share in future prospects.&quot; Research of other stub stocks, Mr. Everingham says, showed &quot;that the rewards have been very, very significant.&quot;    The officials acknowledge Kroger will be under intense pressure to &quot;generate value&quot; for its stub stock. If necessary, the company will consider quickly reducing debt, selling additional stock, or even paying another special dividend, Mr. Everingham says.    Kroger's strategy, the officials say, will depend on economic conditions and on whether major competitors -- many closely held and strapped with debt -- are taken public again. For instance, giant Safeway Stores Inc., taken private in a 1986 buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis, is said to considering selling stock to the public.    As for Kroger, the executives maintain the recapitalization comes at an opportune time, primarily because many competitors are so highly leveraged. &quot;We'll be on more of a level playing field,&quot; says Mr. Everingham. Industry analysts, in fact, often refer to the entire food retailing industry &quot;as one giant LBO.&quot;    Consequently, Kroger doesn't expect debt-laden competitors to initiate many price wars. In addition, Kroger is protected from significant damage from price wars because it competes in a broad geographic area, Mr. Everingham says.    The company intends to slash capital spending to $150 million a year from 1990 through 1992. That's less than half what it spent annually in recent years, with much of those funds spent expanding stores. Currently about 70% of Kroger's stores are either new or recently remodeled. &quot;We start with a store base that is virtually the best in the business,&quot; says Mr. Pichler.    Still, the executives say they plan to remodel 10% of their stores each year.    After its slated asset sales are completed, Kroger will operate in 23 major markets, each consisting of 10 or more stores. In all but one of those markets, the company is either first or second in market share, making Kroger highly focused, the executives say.    They also consider Kroger's 935 convenience stores, the nation's fourth-largest chain, a core business. The company's nine dairies and 11 bakeries, they add, are essential to the on-going business but they will consider disposing of the remaining manufacturing assets, consisting of about 20 facilities.    Previously, the company said it expects to raise $333 million from such asset sales in 1989. Those assets generated sales of about $400 million annually but contributed a paltry $2 million in operating cash flow. Kroger has gotten &quot;a lot of interest&quot; from potential buyers, Mr. Everingham says. </TEXT></DOC>
