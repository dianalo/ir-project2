PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc. confirmed an agreement to order as many as 30 Airbus Industrie A-330 and A-340 aircraft valued at about $2.7 billion.    The order stems from a 1987 agreement Northwest signed to purchase as many as 20 A-340s for delivery starting in 1992. At the time, the airline also obtained an option to purchase as many as 10 A-330s.    Under the latest agreement, Northwest said it would buy 20 A-340 long-range airliners and six A-330 medium-range jets. It obtained four options to purchase either A340s or A-330s-a modification of the earlier agreement.    The 1987 agreement expired in April but Northwest said Airbus held the terms open.    Northwest said it will begin taking delivery of the A-340 aircraft in 1992 for use on trans-Pacific routes. The A-330s, scheduled to be delivered in 1995, are scheduled to be flown on domestic and trans-Atlantic routes.    The airline, whose parent company was taken over last month by investor Alfred Checchi, wouldn't release details about how it plans to finance the transaction. In February, Northwest ordered 10 A-330s. </TEXT></DOC>
