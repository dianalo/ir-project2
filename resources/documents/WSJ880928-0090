The measure, passed on a 388-16 vote, initially would ban shipments to Iraq of arms, other items that could have military use and chemicals that could be used to produce chemical weapons.    Under a second tier of sanctions, the president would be allowed to impose further penalties, including a ban on U.S. agricultural exports to Iraq and a prohibition on imports of oil from Iraq.    Earlier this month, the Senate approved much tougher sanctions that would halt U.S. credit and sales of most materials to Iraq, bar oil imports from Iraq and require the U.S. to vote against loans to Iraq by international financial organizations. Lawmakers are expected to reconcile the two versions in a conference committee.    The Reagan administration opposes imposition of sanctions, preferring to use diplomatic pressure to dissuade Iraq from using chemical weapons. </TEXT></DOC>
