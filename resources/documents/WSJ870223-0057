The Nuggets, members of the National Basketball Association's Midwest Division with a current record of 23 wins and 31 losses, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of 2.1 million Class A units. The units would be sold for $10 to $11 each, raising between $21 million and $23.1 million. The new company will be called Denver Nuggets Entertainment Co. L.P.    Sidney Schlenker, the Nuggets' majority owner and chairman, couldn't be reached for comment, and Nugget officials refused to comment on the filing. But Allen Becker, a Houston businessman and the Nuggets' largest minority shareholder, said proceeds from the offering would eliminate all the debt incurred when a partnership led by Mr. Schlenker bought the franchise. The team was purchased in May 1985 for $17.5 million from Billy J. McCombs, a San Antonio, Texas, auto dealer.    If the offer is successful, Denver would become the second publicly traded NBA franchise. Last October, the world champion Boston Celtics went public by offering 2.6 million master limited partnership units for $18.50 a unit, or $48.1 million.    Proceeds from the offering also will be used to defray expenses from the present owners' renovation of the William H. McNichols Jr. Sports Arena in downtown Denver, where the Nuggets play their home games. A Nuggets spokesman said a club and restaurant were built for season-ticket holders, three public restaurants were added, 19 luxury boxes were installed and the scoreboard and sound system improved at the city-owned arena.    The franchise, which joined the NBA from the American Basketball Association in 1975, ranked seventh last year in attendance among the NBA's 23 teams. A Nuggets spokesman wouldn't comment on gate receipts or the franchise's profitability, but he said attendance through 27 of 41 scheduled home games averaged 12,014, compared with a 1985-86 home attendance average of 12,984.    Mr. Becker said he couldn't say whether the franchise has been profitable. Nor could he say what percentage of the Nuggets was being retained by the partnership. He referred additional inquiries to Walter Richards, a vice president of the new company, who couldn't be reached.    Denver has been in the playoffs for the past five seasons, winning the Midwest crown in the 1984-85 season. Last year, it lost in the second round to the Houston Rockets. </TEXT></DOC>
