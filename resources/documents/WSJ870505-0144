Currently, a unit of Joy Technologies Inc. owns about 94.3% of the common shares of the producer of capital equipment and services for coal mining and other industries. Remaining shareholders will receive for each common share 1.75 shares of preferred stock issued by Joy Technologies, formerly Joy Acquisition Corp.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired in a transaction financed largely through borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
