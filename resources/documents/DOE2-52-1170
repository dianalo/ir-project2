Tensile propertiesof the SiC fiber, the matrix material, and the 0-deg SiC/Ti-24Al-11Nbcomposite (fibers oriented unidirectionally, parallel to the loadingaxis) from room temperature to 1100 C are presented and discussed withregard to the resultant fractography. The as-fabricated fiber-matrixinterface has been examined by scanning transmission electron microscopyand the compounds present in the reaction zone have been identified.Fiber-matrix interaction and stability of the matrix near the fiber ischaracterized at 815, 985, and 1200 C from 1 to 500 hr. Measurementsof the fiber-matrix reaction, the loss of C-rich coating from the surfaceof the SiC fiber, and the growth of the Beta depleted zone in the matrixadjacent to the fiber are presented. These data and the difference incoefficient of thermal expansion between the fiber and the matrix arediscussed in terms of their likely effects on mechanical properties.</TEXT></DOC>
