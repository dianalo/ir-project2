In this invention, the temperature around the positiveelectrode catalyst is maintained at above 0{sup 0}C by utilizing a ground(earth) heat as a heat source of large capacity, and transporting theground heat the inside or the vicinity of the cell by means of a heatpump; this enables the cell to be operated even when the environmenttemperature remains below 0{sup 0}C for a long time.
