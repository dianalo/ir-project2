Edgar Neely told U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell that thegirl's mother, who brought the suit, has no legal standing to sueunder a Georgia law that allows parents to seek damages over theseduction of an minor child.   The judge did not indicate when he would rule.   Lowe, 25, is accused of making the sexually explicit tape of LenaJan Parsons, then 16, and another woman in his hotel suite duringlast summer's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The suitwas filed May 12 by Lena Arlene Wilson, the girl's mother, who isseeking unspecified damages.   Neely argued today that even if the allegations were true, theseduction law is probably unconstitutional, Ms. Wilson is not thegirl's custodial parent as required by law and the woman suffered nodirect emotional harm.   Ms. Wilson does not live with her daughter, Neely said.   J. Hue Henry, Ms. Wilson's lawyer, argued that Lowe seduced MissParsons and that Ms. Wilson has suffered direct harm.   ``One could see how a parent could and would suffer extremeemotional distress'' from seeing such a tape, he said. ``This is acase of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct.''   Lowe did not attend the hearing.   Those who have seen the tape _ and they are legion _ don't seemto question that they are seeing the face and hearing the voice ofthe star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' and ``About LastNight.''   Atlanta's TV stations have run excerpts, over and over and over,with little shadowy boxes blocking out the participants' privateparts. The city's alternative weekly, Creative Loafing, reviewed thetapes as cinema verite.   Rock satirist Mojo Nixon, in a recent Atlanta concert, reworkedseveral of his songs to include verses about the scandal, led hisaudience in chants of ``Oh, no! Rob Lowe!'' and asked _ apparentlyseriously _ if anyone knew where he could see the tapes for himself.   Doubtlessly, someone in the audience did. The tapes have beenpassed around the city's club and party circuit _ not to mention thejournalism community _ so much that bragging about having seen themis now out of fashion.   In court papers, Lowe denied he ``committed any wrongful actsgiving rise to liability.''   Lowe's attorneys also have filed papers accusing Ms. Wilson andHenry of using ``extortionist tactics'' to force Lowe to pay as muchas $500,000 to avoid bad publicity. They also accused Ms. Parsons ofhelping circulate the tape.   ``I knew they would resort to desperate tactics at some point,''Henry responded. ``I expected them to sling all kinds of mud becausetheir client is the one on film in compromising positions, and thereis no way they can avoid that fact.''   Henry said Ms. Wilson rejected a $35,000 ``take-it-or-leave-it''offer from Lowe's attorneys in February, but he denied making any$500,000 settlement demands.   The videotape that has circulated shows the man believed to beLowe in a room with Ms. Parsons and another woman. It shows theteen-ager having sex with the woman, with ``Lowe'' heard and seengiving directions like a movie directr, but it does not showintercourse between the actor and Ms. Parsons. A different segmentof the tape, apparently taken at a different time, allegedly showsLowe having sex with others.   Henry has charged in court papers that Lowe also had sex withMiss Parsons while watched by an unidentified female.   The Fulton County district attorney's office said Lowe is underinvestigation on possible charges of sexual exploitation of a minor,which carries up to 20 years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
