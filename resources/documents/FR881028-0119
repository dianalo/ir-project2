Consequently, any radiological releasesresulting from an accident would not be significantly greater than previouslydetermined. The proposed amendment does not otherwise affect routine radiologicalplant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are nosignificant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposedamendment. The Commission also concludes that the proposed action willnot result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 8, 1988 (53 FR 25713). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternatives to the Proposed Action Because the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed action, there is no need to examinealternatives to the proposed action.Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to operationof San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1, dated October 1973.Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.
