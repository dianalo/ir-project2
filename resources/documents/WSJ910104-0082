The state closed 45 credit unions and small banks after aprivate deposit insurer failed, freezing $1.7 billion indeposits in some 300,000 accounts. While some of theinstitutions will qualify for federal deposit insurance andreopen next week, it has become increasingly apparent tostate officials that some of the largest credit unions are insuch weak condition that they may not qualify for federalinsurance.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, the state may have to bail out theinstitutions at a substantial, though undetermined, cost, orface the ire of thousands of depositors losing millions ofdollars in savings. The state has promised that depositorswon't lose their money up to $100,000 for each account, butthey aren't certain how they'll keep that pledge. Beyond theacute political pressure to keep deposits whole, one stateofficial also mentioned concerns that some areas of the statewill be economically hurt by the liquidation of large creditinstitutions.   After reviewing the finances of 33 credit unions closedthis week by Gov. Bruce Sundlun, the National Credit UnionAdministration, the U.S. agency that insures and regulatescredit unions, accepted 22 relatively small credit unions forcoverage.   However, it has refused so far to insure 11 of the state'smost troubled credit unions, several of which have largetotals of nonperforming assets, management woes and almost noloan loss reserves. The NCUA is concerned that, should any ofthe institutions fail, it would be left to pick up the billby paying off depositors. The 11 institutions have assets of$1.13 billion.   &quot;These institutions are in a lot worse shape than thenormal, federally insured credit unions we're used toseeing,&quot; said Bob Loftus at the NCUA. &quot;They have a highconcentration of commercial and real estate loans, very highloan delinquency rates and some real management problems.&quot;Mr. Loftus said that, in their current condition, the creditunions have no chance of receiving federal insurance.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. hasn't yet decided onwhether to insure the five banks that belonged to the privatedeposit insurer in Rhode Island.   The growing likelihood that the state will have tointervene to bail out depositors raises a host of unpalatableoptions for Rhode Island, which is already struggling torepair a $162 million deficit on its $1.5 billion budget byJune 30.   The state is not obligated to do anything. The insurerthat failed, the Rhode Island Share andamp; Indemnity Corp., isprivate, leaving depositors at risk for any losses thatdeposit insurance can't cover. Yet, state officials, startingwith Gov. Sundlun, say depositors will not take the fall.   &quot;The state is in a very, very difficult position to doanything quickly with numbers of this magnitude,&quot; said JosephDeAngelis, Democratic speaker of the Rhode Island House ofRepresentatives. &quot;Say it becomes a $400 million bailout. It'shard to do that with $162 million deficit. But, while it'scoming at a bad time, we have to do something.&quot;   The question is what. Without ready cash, the state's onlyalternative may be to float municipal bonds, a move thatwould require voters' approval and could take months toorganize.   Even if a bond issue were approved, the state wouldconfront a host of difficulties form rating agencies, whichare already re-assessing its financial condition.   &quot;We're reviewing the situation because the state's ratingsmay need to be changed to protect existing bondholders,&quot; saidGeorge Leung of Moody's Investors Service Inc., noting thatRhode Island currently carries bonds amounting to $725million. &quot;Beyond simply the sheer amount of what might beproposed in a new bond issue, you have to realize that thestate already has serious problems.&quot;   Mr. Leung noted that a new bond issue may be moreexpensive -- because of its perceived riskiness -- than RhodeIsland's current bonds and would probably obligate the stateto offer special collateral to guarantee interest payments.   Maryland and Ohio fashioned similar bailouts in themid-1980s after private insurers in those states couldn'tprotect depositors of savings and loans. But healthyeconomies helped those states recoup most of the moneythrough the selling of assets of their closed financialinstitutions; Rhode Island might have a difficult timeselling assets at a time when failed banks and Sandamp;Ls havealready been glutting the market for deposit sales.   &quot;Who knows how much they can get if they end up sellingoff the assets of these credit unions in the depressed NewEngland economy,&quot; says Louis Reinhardt, a Maryland bankingofficial who is still involved in selling a few remainingassets of his state's failed institutions. &quot;They'll certainlynot get 100 cents on the dollar. Maybe more like 20 or 30cents. The state, I suppose, will have to pick up thedifference.&quot;   Problems with Rhode Island Share andamp; Indemnity firstsurfaced in November, with the failure of Heritage Loan andInvestment Co., a $25 million bank whose collapse caused a$13 million drain on the insurer's capital. As regulators andstate officials began examining the insurer, it became clearthat serious problems at its member institutions, mostlycredit unions, would soon overwhelm the now defunct insurancefund.   The state is still in the throes of a cashflow crisis,with thousands of residents unable to withdraw money for evennominal expenses. Though 22 institutions, representing $381million in assets, have received federal insurance guaranteesand are expected to open Monday, the assets of 11 creditunions, which the NCUA won't cover, may remain frozen formonths.   &quot;We still view a bailout as a last resort, something we'retrying very hard to avoid,&quot; said Sheldon Whitehouse, legalcounsel to the governor, who acknowledged that the state isexamining the procedures for a bond issue. He said the stateis continuing to investigate whether some of the troubledcredit unions -- with capital infusions from the state -- canbe accepted into the NCUA or sold to other financialinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
