The marketvolume for wind energy converters is expected to rise exponentially till1995. However, intensive efforts have to be taken to lower their specificcost. This involves the improvement of infrastructures, the applicationof standardized components and quality assurance in all stages. The authorsreport on a number of test facilities (wind power parks, operationalbuildings) including their cost spendings and market potentials, commenton the application of wind energy plants in developing countries andhighlight weak spots in long-term tests.
