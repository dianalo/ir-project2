Detroit Diesel Corp., 80% owned by entrepreneur RogerPenske's Penske Corp. and 20% owned by General Motors Corp.,yesterday won formal approval from federal and Californiaregulators to begin selling a methanol-fueled version of itsSeries 92 engines for use in transit buses and trucks.</LP><TEXT>   It's the first alternative-fuel heavy engine evercertified to meet both federal clean air standards andCalifornia's stringent environmental regulations. It's alsothe first methanol-fueled engine to go into regularproduction for either heavy or light vehicles.   For Detroit Diesel, the official seals of approvaldelivered by federal and California regulators at a ceremonyhere are another boost for a company that's been on a rollfor three years. Since Mr. Penske took control of theoperation in 1988, Detroit Diesel has transformed itself froma money-losing backwater in GM's empire to a profitablepowerhouse in the heavy-vehicle engine industry.   Detroit Diesel's coup in developing a commercially viablemethanol-fueled heavy engine comes as regulators inWashington, California, and elsewhere are moving to clampdown on dirty diesel engines. And for now, at least,officials say Detroit Diesel is out in front of othercompanies trying to produce clean alternatives.   &quot;We know of no manufacturer who solved all the problems&quot;with alternatives to diesel fuel, said California EnergyCommission Chairman Charles Imbrecht. &quot;No manufacturer isanywhere close to Detroit Diesel on methanol technology.&quot;   Detroit Diesel officials say they're eager to capitalizeon this advantage. &quot;We intend to sell a bunch&quot; of themethanol engines, said Detroit Diesel President Ludvik F.Koci. The company already has orders for about 250 of itsmethanol-powered heavy engines, mainly for use in buses inCalifornia.   Work on the methanol-powered Detroit Diesel engine began adecade ago, under GM's ownership. The project took a higherprofile in 1986, when GM agreed to invest more inclean-diesel research, and give six methanol-powered buses toNew York City. In return, federal officials agreed to dropdemands that GM recall some 1979 Pontiac cars with V-8engines that weren't meeting clean air standards.   The effort didn't always go well. Methanol, a form ofalcohol, can corrode standard fuel lines and engine parts.Mr. Imbrecht recalled standing at San Francisco's Golden GateBridge several years ago to show off a methanol-fueled bus,only to have the engine break down. He has a roasted valvefrom the engine as a souvenir, he said.   But Detroit Diesel officials yesterday showed off severalof some 150 methanol vehicles they've tested in the pastseven years around the country. They included a New York Citygarbage truck, and trucks used by Federal Express Corp. andGolden State Foods Corp., a California distributor forMcDonald's Corp., that have been running on methanol for overa year. Each of these vehicles, the company said, has runreliably for 90% or more of its scheduled work hours.   Moreover, the Detroit Diesel methanol engines going intoproduction already beat by wide margins clean air standardsthat will go into effect for city buses this year inCalifornia, and nationally by 1993. A 277 horsepower DetroitDiesel methanol engine spews just a third of the hydrocarbonsand carbon monoxide allowed by the federal standard. Theengine almost eliminates the sooty &quot;particulates&quot; that belchfrom many older buses, California regulators said.   Yesterday's ceremony attracted a bevy of politicians andBush administration officials to Detroit to share thelimelight. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said themethanol bus engine not only could help reduce use of foreignoil, but ease the trade deficit. It could be &quot;a greatpotential export product,&quot; he said. Rep. John Dingell, whosedistrict lies just south of Detroit Diesel's plant, used theoccasion to lecture California clean air officials aboutoverloading Detroit with regulation.   As auto and engine makers scramble to develop vehiclesthat burn cleaner fuels, Detroit Diesel's success withmethanol engines could give a big boost to proponents of thatalternative. One problem currently facing energy producers isa lack of consensus on what will be the most widely accepted,and thus most marketable, alternative to petroleum-basedfuels for commercial and light vehicles.   But methanol still has drawbacks. Although methanol costsabout 65 cents a gallon, vehicles get only about half themiles per gallon of methanol that they do with regular dieselfuel. A truck used by Federal Express in the Los Angeles areaaveraged just 3.2 miles per gallon of methanol, and isoutfitted with special fuel tanks that are double the usualcapacity. Most methanol-fueled engines will likely go intofleet vehicles, like transit buses, that operate on shorturban routes and return to central fuel depots.   The need for larger fuel tanks is just one obstaclepassenger car makers face in their efforts to developcommercially acceptable methanol vehicles. Another is thatmethanol isn't available at most gas stations. That's whyauto makers are focusing on so-called flexible-fuel vehiclesthat can operate on blends of methanol and unleaded gasoline.   Chrysler Corp. has said it plans to produce as many as100,000 flexible-fuel vehicles by 1993. GM and Ford Motor Co.are testing similar vehicles, as well as vehicles powered bynatural gas. And GM is pushing to work out the bugs in anelectric car it hopes to begin selling by the mid-1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
