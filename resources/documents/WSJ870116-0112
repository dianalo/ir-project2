Boesky Corp. to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its investigation of the Boesky insider trading scandal, sources familiar with the investigation say.    Ivan Boesky told his auditors, who questioned the payment at the time, that it was for &quot;consulting fees&quot; that Ivan F. Boesky Corp., which primarily speculated in takeover stocks, owed Drexel, according to one person involved in the investigation. The payment, sources said, was made last year when Ivan F. Boesky Corp. was dissolved and Mr. Boesky started an investment partnership.    As previously reported, Drexel is the target of an SEC investigation growing out of the Boesky scandal and is also under investigation by a federal grand jury. In particular, the SEC is known to be examining a number of transactions for links between Mr. Boesky and Drexel, including any payments made from one to the other.    Drexel officials declined to comment on the size or purpose of the payment, though they acknowledged that such a payment was made. Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel chief executive officer, said of the SEC that &quot;I expect they're looking at this.&quot; He characterized the fee as an &quot;investment banking fee&quot; and said many people at Drexel are aware of it.    Harvey Pitt, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, said, &quot;I'm really not in a position to comment on whatever people may speculate on the interests of the commission.&quot;    The SEC also declined to comment.    The agency has also subpoenaed the accounting firm that questioned the payment, Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon andamp; Co. Donald M. Tannenbaum, the firm's managing partner, confirmed receiving a subpoena relating to documents in connection with the formation of the Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. limited partnership last March. He said the SEC's investigation &quot;relates to the payment of fees Boesky made to Drexel Burnham.&quot;    According to some sources familiar with the payment, Drexel performed routine investment banking services for Mr. Boesky's company, such as providing research on companies Mr. Boesky considered possible takeover candidates.    But other sources indicated that Mr. Boesky gave conflicting explanations for the payment to members of his staff and his auditors. According to sources familiar with the events, when ordering staff members to make the payment to Drexel, he said it should be identified as trading commissions. Later, however, when the auditors from Oppenheim Appel questioned the payment, he said the fee was for &quot;consulting.&quot; The auditors then asked for documentation of the amount owed, but Mr. Boesky couldn't produce it, the sources said.    The Oppenheim Appel accountants discovered the payment when they examined Mr. Boesky's books prior to issuing a &quot;comfort&quot; letter that was intended to reassure prospective investors in the Boesky limited partnership. The sources said that when Mr. Boesky couldn't provide any documentation, such as commission invoices or bills, to justify the payment, Oppenheim Appel refused to issue the letter.    The sources said a call then was placed to a Drexel official at the firm's Beverly Hills, Calif., office, and Drexel subsequently provided a letter outlining the services rendered in return for the fee. One source familiar with the letter recalls that it was for &quot;consulting and advisory services.&quot; Oppenheim Appel then issued the comfort letter, sources added.    The sources said the letter was signed by two Drexel officials who work in the Beverly Hills office, Lowell Milken and Donald Balser. Mr. Milken is the brother of Michael Milken, the head of Drexel's high-yield &quot;junk bond&quot; operations, who has been subpoenaed by the SEC. Lowell Milken and Mr. Balser have been named in subpoenas to others, but it isn't known whether they have received subpoenas themselves.    In Beverly Hills, a Drexel official declined to comment.    The SEC is understood to be examining the payment and the work performed by Drexel to determine if any inside information was exchanged or if there is evidence of any other improper collaboration between Mr. Boesky and Drexel. Drexel hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, and Drexel officials have said repeatedly that they have no reason to believe that the firm or anyone there has done anything wrong.    Drexel handled the debt placement for Mr. Boesky's limited partnership, raising about $660 million through high-yielding &quot;junk&quot; bonds below investment grade. The sources said that the fee being investigated by the SEC has nothing to do with the debt placement, for which Drexel also earned large fees.    Oppenheim Appel hasn't figured to date in the government's investigation. The medium-sized accounting firm, the country's 16th largest, is known for its work in the securities and brokerage fields. The firm said it is cooperating fully in the government's investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
