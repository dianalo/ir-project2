Neither side would comment publicly on a plan for East Germanyto aid Holocaust victims.   Before the meeting, Edgar M. Bronfman said he hoped a finaldecision could be reached during his visit on reparations to Jewishvictims of Nazi persecution.   But the state-run news agency ADN, in several extensivedispatches, made no mention of discussions about compensation.   Bronfman also refused specific comment on the issue, saying onlythat the talk was ``pleasant, very warm and very cordial.''   ``We agreed on all the fundamentals,'' he said, adding thatdetails of the discussions would be announced Tuesday.   Bronfman has said that an admission of shared responsibility forthe Holocaust was as important as financial contributions tovictims.   ADN said Honecker told Bronfman of East Germany's efforts toeducate its young people about the horrors of Nazi Germany.   ``The struggle against racism and anti-Semitism belongs to theanti-fascist tradition of East Germany,'' Honecker was quoted assaying. ``We will never forget that many Jews, together withcommunists and Social Democrats ... were active in the struggleagainst the Nazi dictatorship.''   ADN quoted Bronfman as telling Honecker that ``I believe thattoday we have built a bridge.''   The news agency said Bronfman thanked Honecker for recentgovernment efforts on the part of Jews, including funding for thereconstruction of an East Berlin synagogue.   After Bronfman arrived Sunday, he told The Associated Press hebelieved the East German leadership was sincere in offeringreparations.   Such an agreement would mark a major change in the communistnation's previous policies.   ``I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``What is at stake here is moralculpability.''   More than 6 million Jews were killed during Adolf Hitler's ThirdReich, a fact that East Germany does not dispute. Since itsfounding in 1949, however, East Germany has argued that it bears noreponsibility for Nazi atrocities because the nation was born afterWorld War II ended.   In past months, East German media have reported on governmentefforts to improve relations with East Berlin's Jewish community.   In June, East Germany said it was willing to provide``humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, butnegotiations have continued on the reparations themselves.   West Berlin Jewish leaders have said that East Germany has beenconsidering paying up to $100 million.   In 1952, West Germany signed an agreement with the World JewishCongress to compensate Holocaust victims and families. Since then,West Germany has paid more than $48 billion to Holocaust survivorsworldwide.   West Germany also was founded in 1949.   Bronfman also planned to meet with leaders of East Berlin's tinyJewish community before departing Tuesday. There are an estimated450-600 practicing Jews in East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
