Kempner was quoted assaying in a newsletter published Friday by the opposition SocialDemocratic Party.   ``Many people who were involved are living among us and receivingsocial assistance,'' said the 89-year-old Kempner, a deputyprosecutor at the 1945-46 postwar trial of Nazi war criminals inNuremberg.   On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi sympathizers destroyed morethan 250 synagogues and 7,500 businesses across Germany. Dozens ofJews died in the pogrom, known as ``Crystal Night'' for theshattered glass left on the streets. ``Many of those responsible forthe pogrom were not brought to account,'' Kempner was quoted assaying.   He did not say whether he knew of any individuals who wereinvolved in the pogrom and are still alive.   Kempner, a lawyer who worked in the German Interior Ministry andlost his job after Nazi leader Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933,left Germany in 1935 and moved to the United States. He returnedafter World War II, participated in the Nuremberg trials as aprosecutor and now has a residence in Frankfurt.
