Goldman, a 28-year-old investment banker from New York, chairman and interim chief executive officer, succeeding William H. McMahan, who resigned.    Mr. McMahan's resignation marks the end of a drawn-out battle for control of the company that started in March, when two dissident shareholders filed suit against Laser, charging that Mr. McMahan had engaged in self-dealing and breach of fiduciary duty. In May, the 50-year-old Mr. McMahan, who has denied the charges, announced his plans to resign as chairman when his contract expired in August. Nevertheless, in July he fought and won a proxy battle initiated in June by the dissidents, Mendell Selig, of Miami, and Mr. Selig's son-in-law Jerome Asher, a garment manufacturer from Boston.    After winning the proxy battle, however, Mr. McMahan agreed to call a special election Oct. 16 to choose a new, three-member board comprising individuals not affiliated with either the company or the dissidents. The new directors are Mr. Goldman, New York lawyer Sheldon Misher and Robert H. Still, a physician from Jacksonville, Fla. Last Monday, Mr. Asher, one of the dissident shareholders, also was named to the board.    Laser, which makes industrial lasers and computer plotters, said it will search for a permanent chief executive. The company also said it agreed with Messrs. Selig and Asher to stay all litigation against the company and Mr. McMahan until Jan. 9, to allow the new board time to &quot;familiarize itself&quot; with the company's operations. A company spokesman wouldn't speculate whether the litigation will ultimately be dropped, now that the dissidents have board representation.    Mr. McMahan wasn't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
