EndsAs UAW Ratifies New Pact---A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</HL><DD> 02/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DE LABORFARM EQUIPMENT (FAR) </IN><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly approved a new contract with Deere andamp; Co., as expected, ending a five-month strike.    The new contract, affecting more than 12,200 Deere unionized employees at 13 plants, provides for increased pension benefits and job-security guarantees, a UAW spokesman said. Wage levels weren't a factor in the dispute, the longest ever faced by the Moline, Ill.-based farm-equipment maker.    Union members were expected to begin returning to their jobs late last night and early this morning. A Deere spokesman said the company &quot;is pleased with the ratification.&quot;    The increase in benefits raises the average UAW Deere employee's total compensation to almost $27 an hour from $24.64 before the strike, the UAW spokesman said. He added that the contract was approved by about 85% of those employees affected. The contract will be in effect until Oct. 1, 1988, putting it, as is the union's practice, in step with the UAW's agreement with Caterpillar Inc.    The UAW began the walkout at three of Deere's facilities last August. The company subsequently closed its remaining 10 union-represented plants, a move the union termed a lockout. Prior to this walkout, Deere hadn't had a strike since 1979 and that one lasted for only 20 days. </TEXT></DOC>
