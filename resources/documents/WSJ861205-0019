In the past, large users had to pay a set rate for transmission, although earlier regulatory changes had freed them to negotiate with producers the price of the gas itself.    The panel's decision apparently will benefit large users that have the capability of switching to alternative forms of fuel. Recent oil-price drops have led many such users to burn oil instead of natural gas, said a spokesman for the commission. The commission's ruling &quot;gives utilities the pricing flexibility they need to compete&quot; for such customers, he said, although it retains certain maximum and minimum charges for transportation. The state's two largest natural-gas distributors are Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. and Southern California Gas Co., a unit of Pacific Lighting Corp.    The decision will permit users that in the past were low on a priority schedule for gas-supply reliability to &quot;bid up&quot; into a higher category, based on the rate they pay the distributor. That aspect of the ruling is expected to benefit enhanced oil recovery operators in the state's Kern County field. Enhanced oil recovery involves injection of steam into the ground to aid in extraction of thick oil, and requires large amounts of fuel, but such users have been on the lowest level of service reliability.    A spokesman for the commission said residential users, and customers that aren't able to switch to alternative fuels, are unlikely to be affected much by the decision. </TEXT></DOC>
