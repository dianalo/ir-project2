Premier Jacques Chirac denied any connection, saying the releaseof Mohamed Mouhajer on March 24 was purely up to the judge.   ``The release ... is linked neither closely nor remotely,neither directly nor indirectly, to the problem of French orforeign hostages in Lebanon,'' Chirac said in a radio interviewThursday.   The leftist paper As-Safir said Thursday ``secret negotiations''were under way to free three Frenchmen _ diplomats Marcel Fontaineand Marcel Carton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann _ being heldby pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.   The Beirut newspaper said an Iranian clergyman and a Lebanesebusinessman were involved in negotiations in the Ivory Coast. Itsaid President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon was told of the negotiations``aimed at obtaining the release of three French hostages.''   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua was in the Ivory Coast thisweek, but broke off his African tour Monday to return to Paris. Hesaid he was needed in the campaign now under way for the April 24presidential elections.   An investigating magistrate cited insufficient evidence infreeing Mouhajer, a Lebanese arrested a year ago during theinvestigation into bombings in 1986 that left 13 people dead and250 injured.   Several newspapers immediately linked the move to the hostages.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidThursday, ``We want all the hostages released, but we oppose makingdeals. Making concessions to terrorists only encourages moreterrorism.''   He noted that France and other participants in a 1987 summitinvolving the seven major industrialized deomcracies ``committedthemselves to the principle of making no concessions to terroristsor their sponsors.''   Nineteen other foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including aFrenchman whose killing was announced by his captors in 1986,though no body was found. Those held include nine Americans, threeBritons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and twounidentified men.   American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped on March16, 1985.   Fontaine, Carton and Kauffmann also were abducted in 1985.   In Geneva, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran told anews conference Thursday that negotiations had been going onbetween France and Iran for 1{ years now on improving relations. Hesaid the French also asked Iranian help in the hostage situation.</TEXT></DOC>
