(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hospital IS now includes patient careandM;The days when hospital staff had to rely on manual operations to performsimple tasks such as appointment scheduling, patient admissions, or transfersand discharges, seem to belong to a not-so-distant past.andM;According to the latest Canadian National Healthcare Computer Survey, theaverage age of computer application systems does not exceed five years formost hospitals.andP;  And although the largest base of computerization in Canadianhospitals continues to be in traditional accounting-base financial systems,there is a growing trend to expand hospitals' automated information handlingcapacity, particularly in their patient care-related systems.andM;&quot;The state of computerization within the hospital community is behind therest of the computer industry,&quot; states Unisys' Ontario Health Care branchmanager Rick Reid.andP;  He says hospitals are still looking for the basics whenit comes to choosing a system that will provide information management rightat their fingertips.andM;&quot;They want to be able to get the patient in and make sure the patient in andmake sure the patient is well cared for,&quot; Reid says.andP;  &quot;Basically hospitalsare trying to reduce the cost associated with having a patient in theirinstitution.&quot;andM;Project manager of information systems at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto,Jim Seville, says computer technology is there to increase the hospital'scapabilities, &quot;not to replace people.&quot;andP;  He says one-source systems were apriority when choosing a system for the hospital and that most of theinformation in the current system is financially-oriented.andM;Ontario Ministry of Health manager of provider support, Steve Russell, agreesthat the financial side of hospital computerization is already underway inmost hospitals.andP;  &quot;The area of expansion is on the customer side, which is ourpatients; hospitals are developing a business case to automate theinformation system to support better quality patient care,&quot; he says.andM;The Ontario Ministry of Health funds the province's 220 hospitals to the tuneof $6.5 billion, says Russell, but the hospitals are on a global budget andcan decide to spend between one to three per cent on computer systems andequipment, depending on their size.andM;According to Jan Goulding of J. Goulding Consultants, a hospital managementconsultant firm based in Toronto, many hospitals have to get &quot;most of the bigbucks, the one-time of computerization costs&quot; from their capital budget --none of which comes from the Ministry.andM;&quot;Hospitals have to go to their foundations to get capital money to buy mostcomputer systems,&quot; Goulding says.andM;Emphasis on planningandM;Brian suddard is with the technical support group at Women's CollegeHospital.andP;  He believes the problem is not that hospitals are underfunded, butrestricted.andP;  &quot;The ministry would tell us 'we need you to produce this kind ofreport', but in order to do that we need the help of computers so we have togo out and spend money to buy them,&quot; he says.andM;Goulding's firm conducts a provincial survey every two years to determine thedevendence on automation within Ontario's hospitals.andP;  The results of the lastsurvey coincided with the Kennedy Group's National Healthcare Computer Surveyin that steady growth has been observed in most hospitals' application areas,but the emphasis is clearly on planning for patient care informationsolutions.andM;And that general consensus is also evident on the ministry side.andP;  SaysMinistry of Health's Russell: &quot;There are business opportunities forhealthcare providers to invest in computers to improve the quality of patientcare with better information systems.&quot;andM;However, he admits his job is not to encourage hospitals to computerize.andO;&quot;I'm there to have both the doctor's side of the business and hospital's sideof the business -- hospital administrators, physicians and care providers --make good accurate quality information about their patients, about theirfinances, and (to convince them) that they should investigate automating.&quot;andM;The National Survey revealed that over 90 per cent of all health institutionsin Canada use some financial system automation and this base ofcomputerization continues to grow along with a comparable growth in advancedpatient care functions.andM;Dietary applications, for example, were a priority for 39 per cent of thosehospitals surveyed which said they were either planning for or selecting anew or replacement information system.andP;  Nursing and patient schedulingfollowed respectively.andM;The survey also reported that application software was acquired from over 200sources with most institutions reporting the use of several sources.andP;  Thereare 42 software vendors that have over one per cent of the respondinghospitals using their software, including Unisys, Baxter-IBM, andHewlett-Packard.andM;Women's College Hospital has been using the Unisys Health Care ManagementSystem (HCMS) since July 1988.andP;  According to Sudder, the system takes care ofboth the financial side and the patient care side.andM;Before acquiring the system, most of the work was done manually.andP;  &quot;Thecomputerization of data has reduced the paper flow tremendously,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;It has reduced all the running around and saved a lot of work.&quot;andM;For Suddard, cost and functionality are priorities when choosing a system.andO;&quot;I don't care whether the computer carries all the cute push buttons andlovely graphics if they are of no use to us.andP;  If the program has thefunctionality, the cosmetics are unimportant,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;It's not up to the Ministry of Health to set up a hospital's accountingsystems, it's up to the hospital,&quot; says Goulding.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
