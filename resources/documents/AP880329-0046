The money will be given to a drug rehabilitation agency chosenby Mayor Edward I. Koch, said state Supreme Court Justice LewisDouglass.   The judge said after the Monday court hearing in Brooklyn thatthe $2.2 million figure was based on the cost of treating about 900heroin addicts for one year.   Douglass said it was the first time a section of the state penallaw that allows restitution to be paid to crime victims was used ina drug case, although the practice occurs on the federal level.   ``I hope this sets a precedent,'' he said.   When the defendant, Agapito Lopez, was arrested in 1985, policeofficers seized six ounces of heroin.   According to the judge's calculations, if those six ounces hadmade it to the street, the drugs would have been used by 898 heroinaddicts who would have bought 20 bags each of heroin.   Douglass said he contacted numerous drug rehabilitation agenciesto find out what the least expensive cost per person was fortreatment. He was told it was $2,400 annually for out-patient care.   The judge multiplied the cost by the number of drug users to getthe restitution figure.   Defense attorney Frank Ortiz said in court he would appeal theorder. He argued that when the state Legislature approved therestitution law, it only contemplated crimes where there was aspecific victim, like robbery or rape.   He also argued that the law requires a hearing to be held forany payment more than $10,000.   Lopez, 44, was convicted March 5, 1987, of numerous counts ofdrug sale and possession. According to Nancy Young, a spokeswomanfor Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, Lopez sold 2,200bags of heroin to an undercover officer for $26,000 between Juneand August of 1985.   Douglass sentenced Lopez in May 1987 to 25 years to life inprison and fined him $52,000, twice the amount of the actual heroinsale.   Young said Lopez owned two houses in Brooklyn, at least onehouse in Staten Island, a car dealership in Aguas Buena, PuertoRico, and other real estate in Puerto Rico. She said Lopez also hadin excess of $60,000 in bank accounts in the United States andPuerto Rico.   The district attorney's office would seize the assets needed tomeet the restitution, Young said.   Holtzman said in a statement released by her office that she waspleased with the judge's order because there is ``a desperateneed'' for drug treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
