Specifically, considerations relating to the possibilityof limited Soviet objectives for terminating a war are analyzed. A possiblefuture war in Europe is the primary example; it is argued that the politicaland military dissolution of NATO and the decoupling of U.S. militarypower from the continent might be sufficient Soviet conditions for seekingwar termination. The hypothesis that the USSR would prefer to fight aconventional war (and avoid nuclear weapons) is examined as is the Sovietneed to maintain cohesion within the Warsaw Pact. It is concluded thatthe limits of conventional warfare and the constraints of alliance dynamicscould interact in Soviet strategy to limit objectives for terminatinga future war in Europe. An appendix supplements and contrasts the thesistext by reviewing Western views on war termination.</TEXT></DOC>
