On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Septemberdelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude oil, rose 3 cents to finish Wednesday at $15.71 per barrel.The contract had declined 19 cents on Tuesday.   The September contract for heating oil, which fell 0.43 cent inthe previous session, finished up 0.08 cent at 44.15 cents agallon. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery settled down 0.58cent at 45.57 cents on the exchange, after falling 0.50 cent onTuesday.   James R. Steele, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., saidfundamental changes were starting to affect the refined-crudeproducts Wednesday.   ``The driving season is basically over and industrial users arelooking more to buy heating oil than gas now,'' he said. ``From nowuntil September, users of heating oil will be stockpiling it forthe winter.''   Steele said the crude market remained confused over U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's announcement that Iranand Iraq would begin a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war on Aug.20.   ``One school of thought says ... this will ultimately make OPECmore cohesive,'' he said. ``The other school says that once theystop fighting both countries will need to pump as much oil as theycan to rebuild their economies.''   Oil prices have been declining in recent months amid speculationthat some members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries were exceeding their official production quotas and wereunlikely to soon reach an agreement to limit production.</TEXT></DOC>
