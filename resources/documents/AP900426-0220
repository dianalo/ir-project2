Fully one-fourth of Seward Park's incoming freshmen are already17 years old. The school is so overcrowded that it is operating at150 percent capacity. Nine out of 10 pupils live with parents whodon't speak English. Some three-quarters of the upperclassmen readbelow grade level. The average Scholastic Aptitude Test score was288 on the verbal section, on a scale of 200-800, and dozens livein welfare hotels or homeless shelters. Less than 14 percent of theschool's seniors read at grade level.   But there's another number that tells a more encouraging storyabout Seward Park, a number that says there are students, plenty ofthem, that beat the odds.   A former New York Times reporter, Samuel Freedman, spent a yearat this old, overcrowded, money-starved school and found,remarkably, that 92 percent of pupils who graduate go on to highereducation.   Are we thus wrongly stereotyping urban schools as unqualifiedfailures? Freedman thinks we have overlooked the dedication ofteachers like Jessice Siegel, and students like See Wai Mui, aChinese immigrant, and Carlos Pimentals, from a backwater town inthe Dominican Republic, whose success in school takes a kind ofcourage almost impossible to comprehend.   Their stories are told in intricate and fascinating detail inFreedman's important new book, ``Small Victories: The Real World ofa Teacher, Her Students andamp; Their High School'' (Harper andamp; Row,$22.95).   This is a humane, genuine and extraordinarily detailed portraitof a ghetto high school, right down to the very bricks.   In common with the best recent books and movies of this growinggenre _ the film ``Stand and Deliver,'' and the Tracy Kidder'sbook, ``Among Schoolchildren'' _ ``Small Victories'' does not limititself to portraits of adults such as teachers or principals.Refreshingly, the children are treated as main players on theschool stage _ no mean feat for an author, because youngsters thiage, especially immigrants, are not the easiest interview subjects.   In an interview, Freedman said he wanted to develop truepictures of at least a few of the students in the school andtraveled halfway around the globe to do so. His research took himto the People's Republic of China and the Dominican Republic, thehomelands of the majority of Seward Park's immigrant students.   The picture that emerges is complicated, a blend of optimism anddespair. On the one hand, there is Jessica Siegel, a teacher anddream-weaver, who cares so much about her profession it finallyconsumes her.   We feel cheered as she jawbones youngsters who never thoughtthey could go to college. She cajoles college admissions officersinto giving students with C-averages a chance. She drives her kidshundreds of miles to vouch for them at college interviews.   And we are inspired by the stories of many of her students. SeeWai, for example, came to New York in 1980, an immigrant from ruralChina. By the time he entered Seward Park, his English was stillhalting and the Chinatown that was his home left him prey to youthgangs.   Jessica spotted his potential and became his support, helpinghim with his self-assurance and his English. See Wai, this kid whodefied the odds of his background, ends up at State University ofNew York at New Paltz where he is now a sophomore.   Yet such ``small victories'' are mingled with many daily defeats.   As Freedman says, ``what I would hope people will take away fromthis is that schools like Seward Park are designed to fail.''   Meaning: neighborhood urban high schools, those designed to takeall comers, are being systematically starved of funds by unfairformulas that send more money per pupil to the more selective cityhigh schools _ not to mention state funding formulas that generallygive suburban schools a big money edge over city schools.   The successes, inspirational and noteworthy as they are, remainexceptions.   ``Small Victories'' ends on the bittersweet note that Siegeldecides that she's had it with teaching after nine years of longdays, late evenings and too many bureaucratic hassles. She's had itwith the teachers union, with students who refuse to be reached,most of all with a life that doesn't leave room for finding ahusband or even a steady boyfriend.   She decides to return to an earlier occupation, journalism.   She'd thought often of quitting her $29,442 job. She'd thoughtabout how ``you grind yourself to dust'' and ``all you hear aboutin return are lousy kids and lousy schools and lousy teachers. Youread an article in The New York Times about single women in whichsomebody says it's tough to get dates if you're a teacher becausemen are looking for professionals.''   ``I understand I'm doing really good work,'' she says finally,through tears. ``But I'm sacrificing my life.''</TEXT><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ Lee Mitgang has covered education for the AP</HEAD><TEXT>   since 1981.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, May 4-6</NOTE></DOC>
