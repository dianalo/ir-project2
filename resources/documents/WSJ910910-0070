Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh appearsready to undo the agency one official at a time. After morethan five years in office and untold tens of millions oftaxpayer dollars spent, Mr. Walsh grinds on like someprosecutorial robot, set loose with the most legalistic mindin the most political city in the world.   Last week Mr. Walsh got an indictment of Clair George forthe supposed crime of not telling Congress what Congressdidn't want to hear. This is another &quot;Walshing,&quot; whereby alegally bizarre prosecution forces its middle-class victim tospend millions of dollars to hire lawyers to shut Mr. Walshdown. Joe Fernandez, the first CIA official whom Mr. Walshtargeted, ran up a whopping $1.8 million personal legal billbefore his case was dismissed.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. George, a 33-year CIA veteran who ran covertoperations, could face a 50-year jail term based on Mr.Walsh's curious views of criminal law and separation ofpowers. The most interesting part of the indictment is what'smissing. There's no allegation that Mr. George violated anylaw relating to the Contras or Iran; Mr. Walsh again duckedthe challenge of defending the Boland amendment asconstitutional. Instead, the heinous crime is that in 1986Mr. George failed to publicize information that it was hisjob to keep secret.   Count One, for example, charges that Mr. George &quot;didimpede and endeavor to impede the investigation of the U.S.Senate Committee on Foreign Relations&quot; when (ready for this?)&quot;he did not reveal . . . that Max Gomez was a known aliasused by Felix Rodriguez.&quot; Mr. George's job was to protectundercover agents, but Mr. Walsh apparently believes thatprotecting an alias established Mr. George's criminal intent.   Mr. Walsh also rolled right by the well-choreographedTestimony Two-Step, in which Congressmen are careful not topush for anything they don't want to bear the responsibilityfor knowing and executive-branch officials signal whentestimony is approaching that level of sensitivity. Onecharge was based on a question by a congressional staffer whoasked for the precise role of Richard Secord. Mr. George'sanswer was, &quot;I cannot. Please.&quot; This answer, not even givento a Member of Congress, is supposedly a crime.   More broadly, if Mr. Walsh thinks Mr. George is a felonbecause he didn't rush to Congress with news aboutIran-Contra, there's no telling where he might stop. RonaldReagan and George Bush, not to mention George Shultz andCaspar Weinberger, &quot;knew&quot; about the Iran arms deal beforeCongress knew.   The idea of criminally prosecuting Mr. George isespecially outrageous because in 1987 he returned to the samecongressional committees to give them details aboutIran-Contra -- none of which, by the way, Mr. Walsh has everproved in any court was a crime. So why is Mr. Walshindicting Mr. George in 1991?   As always, Mr. Walsh clearly hopes to justify hisexpensive prosecutorial existence. While the Georgeindictment itself couldn't hold the city's attention forlong, it feeds directly into the hearings on the nominationof Robert Gates for director of the CIA.   Mr. George has correctly said that &quot;this indictment merelymakes me a pawn in the continuous drama of politicalexploitation.&quot; He promises that Mr. Walsh will have to provehis case in court. The better legal defense would be forPresident Bush to finally do what President Reagan shouldhave done years ago: Pull the plug on Mr. Walsh.</TEXT></DOC>
