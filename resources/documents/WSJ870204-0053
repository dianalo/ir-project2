The indictments are the first round of what prosecutors said will be a series of charges involving bribery, influence-peddling and other violations at the center, a Pentagon agency that buys uniforms and other clothing for all of the military services.    The indictments detail more than $180,000 in alleged bribes or illegal payments involving contracts worth more than $2.2 billion. Many of the payments allegedly were funneled to buyers at the center through Leo Lamer, an Aston, Pa. consultant.    According to the indictment, Frank Coccia, the senior civilian purchasing official in one portion of the center, and two lower-level government buyers received illegal payments from companies or contractors seeking business with the center. Mr. Lamer and center officials developed a system of code words to designate who would get contracts in return for illegal payments, according to the indictment.    Also indicted was New Jersey Assemblyman Joseph Chinnici, president of Bridgeton, N.J.-based Major Coat Company Inc., on bribery, conspiracy and fraud charges relating to a payment to Mr. Coccia. His company was indicted on those charges, too.    Mr. Lamer declined to comment and Mr. Coccia couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Chinnici said &quot;I'm not guilty, and we're not going to go out of business.&quot; He declined to elaborate.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Pentagon investigators and managers at the Defense Logistics Agency are continuing their three-year investigation of the case. Justice Department officials said they expect additional charges.    The indictments come in the wake of a separate, but similar bribery investigation involving the Pentagon's Defense Industrial Supply Center, which buys about $700 million of screws, cables and other hardware for the military. That probe has resulted in convictions or guilty pleas by more than two dozen individuals.    FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have said that bribery and other types of criminal behavior by officials working in such purchasing centers pose a major threat to the integrity of the Defense Department's procurement process. </TEXT></DOC>
