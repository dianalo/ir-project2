TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Labor leader Shimon Peres toppled the coalitiongovernment of hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursdayand declared that with his action, he had created ``momentum towardpeace.''   Peres drove a no-confidence vote through Parliament after Shamirhad balked for weeks at U.S. proposals to get talks started withthe Palestinians.   Shamir, the first premier in Israel's 42-year history to beturned out of office by a no-confidence vote, listened to the votetally with his head down, glumly shuffling papers on his desk.   ``We are not surprised ... and I am not sorry,'' he toldreporters later.   Said Peres, who is likely to be picked to form a new government,``Parliament has shown that there is a majority for peace. Ibelieve we can form a government that will reach a dialogue withthe Palestinians.''   But little headway is considered likely in peace efforts as longas Israel is consumed with internal poltics. Fashisoning a newcoalition government may take months.   In London, visiting King Hussein of Jordan said Thursday theUnited States must take more responsibility for Middle East peacebecause of Israel's political crisis, and he warned that extremistson both sides could endanger world peace.   ``Something needs to be done and fast,'' he told a luncheon ofthe Association of American Correspondents in London.   Peres won on a 60-55 vote after a vitriolic debate and intensebehind-the-scenes bargaining that lasted 10 hours. The victory camefrom a majority of those present and voting in the 120-memberKnesset, or parliament.   The political crisis comes during a continuing Palestinianinsurrection in the occupied lands against Israeli rule. At least663 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civiliansin the revolt that began in December 1987. Forty-three Israelisalso have been slain in the violence.   As a result of Thursday's loss, Shamir, 74, a former undergroundleader and spymaster for the Mossad secret service, could face anuprising in his own Likud bloc.   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon and Housing Minister David Levy,both hawks who want to abandon the U.S. peace effort, haverepeatedly sought to oust Shamir from the party leadership, whichhe assumed in 1983.   Starting Sunday, aides said, President Chaim Herzog will canvassparliament members as to who should form the next government. He isexpected to give the nod to Peres, who would have a maximum of sixweeks to assemble a coalition.   In the interim, Shamir will stay on as head of a caretakergovernment in which no ministers are allowed to resign and none canbe added.   If Peres fails, Shamir or another Likud leader may be chosen toform a government. If that fails, new elections may be called.   The past two elections, in July 1984 and November 1988, ended invirtual tie votes that forced the two big parties into coalitions.   For Peres, trying to mesh leftist secular parties withconservative religious factions will be a major test.   In the past, Orthodox parties have demanded tougher laws to dealwith restaurants and stores that open on the Sabbath, a majorsource of friction with liberal factions.   Peres won primarily on a stay-away vote by five of the sixmembers of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, which allied with Likudin the past.   Shamir might have avoided the no-confidence vote if he had goneto Herzog and resigned the government or survived it by agreeing toa last-minute compromise from Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas' spiritualleader.   Yosef proposed acceptance of U.S. proposals for starting adialogue with Palestinians. Shamir stuck to his belief that theU.S. ideas would give the PLO a role and jeopardize Israel's claimto sovereignty over the captured Arab sector of Jerusalem.   Shamir insisted his party was just as interested in making peaceas Labor. In unusually tough language, he accused Peres of makingconcessions that benefited Israel's Arab enemies, such as hisendorsement of an international peace conference.   Peres scoffed at Shamir's concerns, saying Shamir was the victimof ``antiquated ideas'' and that the right-wing premier'sfoot-dragging had been ``murdering the peace process.''</TEXT></DOC>
