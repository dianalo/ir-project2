The Commerce Department said state tax revenues totaled $264 billion for the year ended June 30, 1988, compared with $246 billion in the previous fiscal year.    Tax collections in Hawaii, Montana and Oklahoma posted 20% gains each, the department said. Other states registering big gains included Texas, 19%; Alaska, 18%; Kansas and Maine, 17% each; Florida, 16%, and South Dakota, 15%.    Alaskans also paid more state taxes on a per-capita basis -- $2,439 each -- than residents of the other 49 states, the department said. However, the Alaska payments included $818.7 million in severance taxes on oil and gas production that distort individual income-tax payments.    New Hampshire had the lowest per-capita state tax, $532. The national per capita tax average was $1,077.    Three states had decreases in 1988 overall tax collections -- Wyoming, down 9%, and Oregon and West Virginia, falling 6% each, the department said.    California had the largest total state tax revenue, $36 billion, followed by New York, $26 billion; Texas, $13 billion; Pennsylvania, $12 billion; Illinois, Michigan and Florida, $11 billion each; and Ohio, $10 billion. These eight states accounted for nearly half of the taxes collected nationally.    Although it ranked among the top nine states in percentage revenue gains, South Dakota collected the smallest amount in state taxes, $476 million. Ranking with it at the bottom of the tax collection list were Wyoming, $573 million; New Hampshire, $583 million; Vermont, $617 million; and North Dakota, $633 million.    General sales and gross receipts taxes were the largest source of state tax revenues at $87 billion, up 10% from 1987. Individual income taxes accounted for $80 billion, up 5%, while corporate net income taxes rose 6% to $22 billion.    The Commerce report included data on state taxes only, most of which was collected by a canvass of state offices. Revenue from non-tax sources such as federal government payments wasn't included. </TEXT></DOC>
