(BBT) Tuesday announced the Fiber Loop Access(FLX) System, the first fiber optic transport system that allows telephonecompanies to deliver cost-effective voice services and through a seamlessupgrade, enhanced digital services.andM;The FLX System is said to deliver the benefits of fiber optics, includingaccess to advanced video and data services, from the central office to thesubscriber.andP;  The system, which is currently being tested by three of theseven Regional Bell Operating Companies -- Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Ameritech-- complies with fiber-in-the-loop architecture recommendations recentlyreleased by BellCore.andM;The FLX System enables telephone companies to deliver voice communications ata cost competitive with today's copper-based service -- a requirement ofregulators.andP;  At the same time, it provides the telephone companies with theplatform from which they can offer advanced narrowband services, such asISDN, and broadband services such as video.andP;  All this is available in asystem that is compatible with today's telephone network topology.andM;&quot;The FLX System is the first, cost-effective switched digital video system,and will allow telephone companies to deliver a new generation of advanced,personalized video services,&quot; said Salim Bhatia, BBT president and chiefexecutive officer.andP;  &quot;BBT offers the only system that can be upgraded to offerdigital video services, without requiring either totally separate facilitiesfor video transport, or separate transmitter and receiver equipment.&quot;andM;The FLX Systems, through an intelligent, software-defined selectioncapability, will allow service providers (CATV companies, broadcasters) tooffer consumers a broad range of video channels or data services from whichto choose.andP;  This selection capability reduces the bandwidth required forvideo transport to individual subscribers, reducing the cost.andM;EASY VIDEO UPGRADE Upgrading the FLX System to video capability is easy forthe telephone companies.andP;  It requires only changing optoelectronic line cardsat the telephone company's remote terminal and at the subscriber's home orcurbside pedestal, without affecting other homes on the system.andM;The FLX System matches the switched star topology of today's telephonenetwork, and is designed to be compatible with current and emerging publicnetwork standards.andP;  It also incorporates the telephone network's nextgeneration Operation, Administration and Maintenance techniques by conformingto forward looking standards such as TR303.andP;  This will simplify the telephonecompanies' efforts to integrate the FLX System into the network.andM;&quot;The quality, capacity, and reliability of fiber optic technology that foryears has been in long-distance networks, will soon be available at theindividual subscriber level,&quot; said J. Richard Jones, executive vicepresident, engineering at BBT.andP;  &quot;The telephone companies are committed toinstalling fiber along the last mile of service to reduce ongoing costs andbuild capability for future services.andP;  The FLX System is the firstcost-effective solution.&quot;andM;PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORKING The FLX System employs Passive Optical Networkingtechnology which splits a single lightwave signal containing multiplechannels into multiple lightwaves which can be allocated as needed amongsubscribers.andP;  The system shares the distribution fiber and transmissionelectronics over a number of subscribers, which results in costs that in somecases are lower than those for the installation of copper systems, whichtoday averages around $1,100.andM;BENEFITS CLAIMED o  Service providers will have greater service reliabililityand increased control over the selection and delivery of a far broader rangeof subscriber information and entertainment services than is supported todayby broadcast-oriented systems.andM;o  Viewers will benefit through the availability of instant pay-per-view, awider range of channels for customer selection, and new interactiveinformation delivery services.andM;o  Broadcasters and local affiliates will regain the identity they have lostin today's cable systems, as viewers will be provided with real-time programand source information through displays, listings and menus.andP;  In addition,television equipment will produce the high quality video and audio it wasdesigned to support.andM;AVAILABILITY The FLX System's standard telephone service capability will becommercially available in the first quarter of 1991.andP;  The switched digitalvideo capability will be commercially available in the fourth quarter of1991.andM;The FLX System is well-positioned in a market that is expected to soar.andP;  Arecent industry study, conducted by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., estimates that theannual fiber-to-the-home market will grow to $4-$5 billion in the next fewyears.andP;  That study also indicates that deployment by the RBOCs will begin in1991.andM;Bell Atlantic is field testing the FLX System in the community development ofCascades in Loudoun County, Va.andP;  Ameritech will field test the system inTipton Lakes, a residential development near Columbus, Ind., while in May,researchers at the NYNEX Science andamp; Technology Center tested the FLX System,to better understand the technology and the implications of field deployment.andO;In addition, Contel has tested the system.andP;  Other U.S.andP;  trials are plannedfor this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
