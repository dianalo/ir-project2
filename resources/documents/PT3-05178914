The seed treated surface is exposed      to heat to imidize the precursor composition.

The polyamic acid film      is exposed to a solution containing palladium cations. The      palladium-treated film is heat-treated within a time/temperature schedule      that causes imidization of the polymer to occur. The seeded film is then      ready thereafter to be exposed to an electroless plating bath which causes      the deposition of a blanket metal film on the surface of the polymer. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the method embodies generation of a polyamic acid film on a      substrate in the manner disclosed above, curing the film to the polyimide      form, and thereupon mechanically abrading the film's surface using      sandpaper or some other abrading means to roughen the surface. The film is      then exposed to a solution containing palladium cations. The seeded film      is thereafter exposed to an electroless plating bath which causes the      deposition of a blanket of metal film on the surface of the polymer film. </PAR><PAR>  Polymers which can be satisfactorily used as substrates or dielectrics in      accordance with the present invention are selected from the following      group: </PAR><PA0>  polyamides </PA0><PA0>  polyesters </PA0><PA0>  polyurethanes </PA0><PA0>  polysiloxanes </PA0><PA0>  phenolics </PA0><PA0>  polysulfides </PA0><PA0>  polyacetals </PA0><PA0>  polyethylenes </PA0><PA0>  polyisobutylenes </PA0><PA0>  polyacrylonitriles </PA0><PA0>  polyvinylchlorides </PA0><PA0>  polystyrenes </PA0><PA0>  polymethylmethacrylates </PA0><PA0>  polyvinylacetates </PA0><PA0>  polytetrafluoroethylenes </PA0><PA0>  polyisoprene </PA0><PA0>  polycarbonates </PA0><PA0>  polyether </PA0><PA0>  polyimides </PA0><PA0>  polybenzimidazoles </PA0><PA0>  polybenzoxazoles </PA0><PA0>  polybenzothiazoles </PA0><PA0>  polyoxadiazoles </PA0><PA0>  polytriazoles </PA0><PA0>  polyquinoxalines </PA0><PA0>  polyimidazopyrrolones </PA0><PAL>  and copolymers containing an aromatic constituent and a constituent      selected from a vinyl and cyclobutane group, wherein the aromatic      constituent and the vinyl and cyclobutane groups contain at least one      element selected from the group comprising Si, Ge, Ti, Zn and Fe as      described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/366,089 filed      Jun. 13, 1989. </PAL><PAR>  The most highly preferred polymers are used in accordance with the present      invention polyimide type polymers. Polyimide polymers are described in the      Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition in the article entitled      &quot;Polyimides&quot; Volume 18, p. 704, the teaching of which is incorporated      herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, the polyimides include the following recurring unit where the      arrows indicate isomerism:      ##STR1##      where n is an integer representing the number of repeating units to      provide a molecular weight usually in the range of about 10,000 to about      100,000. R is at least one tetravalent organic radical selected from the      group consisting of:      ##STR2##      R.sub.2 being selected from the group consisting of divalent aliphatic      hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and carbonyl, oxy,      sulfo, sulfide, ether, siloxane, phosphine oxide, hexafluoroisopropylidene      and sulfonyl radicals and in which R.sub.1 is at least one divalent      radical selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic organic radical      or from the group shown:      ##STR3##      in which R.sub.3 is a divalent organic radical selected from the group      consisting of R.sub.2, silicon, and amino radicals. Polymers containing      two or more of the R and/or R.sub.1 radicals, especially multiple series      of R.sub.1 containing amino radicals, can be used. </PAR><PAR>  Polyimides are available commercially from a wide variety of suppliers in      one of three forms: a) as solutions of the polyamic acid precursors (e.g.,      DuPont Pyralin); as pre-imidized polyimide form (e.g., DuPont Katpon      film); or c) as pre-imidized powders (e.g., Ciba-Geigy Matrimid 5218) or      solutions (e.g., Ciba-Geigy Probimide). The chemistry of commercial      polyimides includes examples of many of the components listed above, but a      preferred polymer for use pursuant to the present invention is based on      the monomers pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and oxydianiline (ODA), also      named 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether. Other preferred polymers for use      pursuant to the present invention are the polymers of      benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) and ODA and/or      1,3-phenylenediamine and polymer of 3,3'-biphenylenediamine (PDA). </PAR><PAR>  Polyimide films based on PMDA-ODA are available from Allied Corporation      under the trade name Apical and from DuPont under the trade name Kapton.      Films based on BTDA-PDA are available from UBE Corporation as Upilex and      from Hitachi Chemical Company in solution form as PIG-L100. Other trade      name polyimides useful pursuant to the present invention include Durimide      from Rogers Corporation and the DuPont Pyraline series, including PI-2525      and PI-2566. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that the direct production of high molecular weight aromatic      polyimides in a one-stage polymerization cannot be accomplished because      the polyimides are insoluble and infusible. The difficulty is that the      polymer chains precipitate from the reaction media (regardless of whether      solution or melt) before high molecular weights are obtained. Polyimides      are, therefore synthesized by a two-stage process. The first stage      involves an amidation reaction carried out in a polar solvent such as N,      N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or      N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to produce a high molecular weight polyamic acid. </PAR><PAR>  A typical reaction is as follows:      ##STR4## </PAR><PAR>  Processing of the polymer can only be accomplished after the first stage,      at which point it is still soluble and fusible. The polymer is insoluble      and infusible after the second stage of the process. The polyamic acid is      formed into the desired physical form of the final polymer product (i.e. a      film) and the second stage of the reaction is carried out. The polyamic      acid is cyclized in the solid state to the polyimide by heating at      moderately high temperatures above 150.degree. C. The polymer is kept in a      solution during the amidation reaction by using mild conditions i.e.      temperatures of 70.degree. C. or below so as to keep the amount of      cyclization to a minimum. </PAR><PAR>  The amides which are of use in the present invention comprise polyether      imides, polyamides, polyisoimidazole and poly isoindoloquinazolindione. It      has been determined that high temperature ladder or ladder type i.e.      semi-ladder polymers such as polyimidazopyrroles are useful. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a polyamic acid      of suitable thickness is deposited on a substrate which can conveniently      be copper or some other metal. The polymer is dried at a low temperature,      i.e. between 50.degree. C. and 150.degree. C. to a weight percent solids      in the range of 20% to 100% at 10% to 100% amic acid. The resultant      composite is contacted with an aqueous metal cation solution, for example      palladium nitrate, at a concentration range of 0.001 to 10 mg/ml for      suitable time to allow seeding of a polymer for example any where from 30      seconds to 45 minutes, preferably 1 to 5 minutes. The resultant treated      product is rinsed in water for sufficient time to remove impurities. This      rinsing step can be for as long as 60 minutes but is usually between 1 and      5 minutes. The product is then placed in a room-temperature oven and then      heated to a temperature of from about 180.degree. to  225.degree. for      sufficient time to induce imidization. The temperature in the oven is      usually ramped to about 225.degree. C. to induce imidization. The dwell      time for such treatment in the room-temperature oven ranges between 5      minutes and 1 hour usually around 15 minutes. </PAR><PAR>  The composite is then plated in any of the standard commercially available      electroless baths for anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, preferably      about 2 minutes. The plated product is rinsed in flowing water for a      period of from 1 to 60 minutes and is thereupon baked for 0.5 to 24 hours      at temperature ranging from between about 85.degree. C. and 100.degree. C.      The treated composite is then ready to be electroplated in the standard      acidic cupric sulfate electroplating bath. </PAR><PAR>  In the alternative embodiment of the present invention a PMDA-ODA polyimide      of suitable thickness double clad on two ounce copper fully cured, is      abraded using any convenient means such as sandpaper. The extent of the      mechanical abrasion of the polyimide surface should be sufficient to allow      formation of surface chemical species which will complex metal cations      when exposed thereto. The abraded polymer surface is then cleaned with      water using, if desired, an ultrasonic water tank. It is then seeded in an      aqueous metal solution, for example palladium nitrate, at a concentration      range of 0.001 to 10 mg/ml for a period of about 30 seconds to about 45      minutes. The seeded polymer is then rinsed in water for sufficient time to      remove impurities and is thereupon ready to be plated in the standard      electroless copper bath for a period of 30 seconds to 5 minutes generally      2 minutes. After the electroless treatment the product is rinsed in water      for up to 5 minutes, or whatever time is sufficient to remove impurities. </PAR><PAR>  The parts prepared in accordance with the embodiments described above, seed      and plate efficiently and effectively and the adhesion of the plated metal      is such that no failure is observed with the standard scotch tape peel      test after 90 minutes in the electroless bath. </PAR><PAR>  The processes described herein have obvious uses in any application where      is desirable to metallize a polyimide film especially a polyimide film      that was supplied as a polyamic acid film and thermally imidized. The      methods described herein have advantages over those existing in the prior      art in that they easily processed and do not require the special handling      apparatuses and treatments, such as dry box atmosphere, vacuum      depositions, plasma treatments as are required in the prior art. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The preferred embodiment of the invention can be illustrated by means of      the following examples. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A sample of an imide polymer designated polyimide 2525 having a thickness      of 0.00508 cm which was double clad on two ounce copper, was dried at low      temperature to 69 weight percent solids at 94% amic acid. The product was      seeded in an aqueous palladium nitrate solution having 1 mg/ml      concentration for about 45 minutes. The seeded product was rinsed in      flowing water for 60 minutes then placed in a room-temperature oven and      ramped to 225.degree. C. for a dwell time of 15 minutes. The product was      then plated in a standard room-temperature copper electroless bath for 2      minutes, rinsed in flowing water for 60 minutes and baked for 24 hours at      85.degree. C. The product was then electroplated in a standard acidic      cupric sulfate electroplating bath at 4 mA/cm.sup.2 to a thickness of      0.0003175 cm. The electroplated product was rinsed in flowing water for 60      minutes and bakes for 24 hours at 85.degree. C. A ninety degree peel test      was performed and it was determined that the peel strength equaled 35.andplus;-.7      g/mm for 2,3 and 4 mm peel lines. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  A PMDA-ODA polyimide having a thickness of 0.00508 cm double clad on 2      ounce copper, fully cured was sanded with 400 grit sandpaper and the      surface so treated was cleaned in an ultrasonic water tank. The polyimide      having the abraded surface was seeded by contacting same in an aqueous      palladium nitrate solution having a concentration of 0.1 g/ml for 1      minute. The product is then rinsed in water for about 5 minutes and plated      in the standard room-temperature electroless copper bath for a period of      about 90 minutes. The electrolessly plated composite is rinsed in water      for 5 minutes and is then suitable for electroplating in a standard acidic      cupric sulfate electroplating bath at 40 mA/cm.sup.2 to a thickness of      about 0.0003175 cm. </PAR><PAR>  While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect      to the preferred embodiments set forth above, it will be understood by      those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and      details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of      the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new, and desire to      secure by Letters Patent is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
