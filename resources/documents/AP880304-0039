The suggestion that the reserve forces may be overextended comesas budget problems appear likely to prevent any significant growthin reserve and National Guard forces in fiscal 1989.   In recent years, the 22-member Reserve Forces Policy board hasconsistently argued that more money be appropriated for thereserves because of their increasing role in military preparednessand strategy.   The Selected Reserve Forces _ the drilling, so-called ``weekendwarriors'' _ now total more than 1.1 million people, compared withthe 2.1 million on active duty.   Under the so-called ``Total Force'' policy adopted in 1973, manyof those reservists and Guardsmen would go to war before theiractive-duty counterparts because of the equipment they use or thejobs for which they have been trained.   The policy board, in its just-released fiscal 1987 report,repeats its plea for greater financial support for the reserveforces. But it also advances the unexpected suggestion that thePentagon should attend to the strength of its active-duty forcesfirst.   ``An appropriate balance should exist between the active andreserve components,'' the board stated.   According to Col. Phil Fogel, an aide to the panel, the boardissued its warning this year in part because of decliningprojections for military spending.   ``When you have budget constraints, people tend to want to shiftmore responsibilities to the reserves to save money,'' Fogel saidThursday.   ``The board is saying you've got to have a sufficientactive-duty force, and that you can't shift like that withoutproviding the necessary resources, money, spaces in schools, etc.''   The board said it thought ``the most suitable missions for theNational Guard and reserves are those with low peace-time activitylevels and high war-time surge requirements.''   ``If a mission must be performed on a daily basis or requiresdaily training, that mission is best suited to the activecomponent,'' the panel said.</TEXT></DOC>
