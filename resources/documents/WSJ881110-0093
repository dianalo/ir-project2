Freedman and Bruce Ingersoll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD MKT </IN><TEXT>   Egg sellers are scrambling to find ways to salvage a product that many people see as a marketer's nightmare.    After much squabbling, all egg producers soon will be required to pay fees to fund national industry promotions. At the same time, some individual producers are trying to promote eggs by using brand names or playing on regional chauvinism. On the farm and in the lab, the race is on to remake the egg.    But these efforts may be too little, too late. Per-capita egg consumption is at an all-time low. Part of the problem is consumer concern about cholesterol and, more recently, salmonella in eggs. In addition, eggs -- a longtime staple of home baking and home-cooked breakfasts -- are out of sync with Americans' quest for ready-to-eat foods.    &quot;The egg in a shell is an ingredient, and people want foods,&quot; says Leo Shapiro, a food consultant, citing the popularity of McDonald's Corp.'s Egg McMuffin.    Some marketers still think the egg can be helped by better promotion. The dairy and beef industries have advertised aggressively to allay consumer concerns about their products. In contrast, &quot;the egg industry has never learned to market,&quot; says John Albright, a Lancaster, Pa., egg producer. &quot;Farmers think just putting a flock of chickens in a barn and then selling their eggs at the lowest price is going to be a profitable business venture.&quot;    Under an egg-marketing law enacted by Congress last month, farmers will give an 18-month trial to a mandatory assessment of 2 1/2 cents per 30 dozen eggs. That will raise $3.5 million a year for the American Egg Board to use for public relations, such as a &quot;Cholesterol Action&quot; program to ease health worries about eggs. But that amount isn't nearly enough for Madison Avenue to hatch another media blitz.    Perhaps that's just as well. After all, past advertising efforts generally have been disappointing. From 1985 to 1987, the California Egg Commission made an &quot;Anything Goes With Eggs&quot; appeal to California yuppies, perhaps the group least inclined to buy many eggs. It didn't work. Last year, the commission started a &quot;Have Some Eggs Now&quot; campaign aimed at eggs' biggest aficionados -- blacks, Orientals and especially Hispanics. The ads are still running, but overall consumption in California continues to decline.    A national &quot;Incredible Edible Egg&quot; campaign had some short-lived success before petering out three years ago due to lack of funds. But despite winning some converts, it may have done long-term damage. James Jordan, chairman of Jordan McGrath Case andamp; Taylor, a New York ad agency that wasn't involved in the campaign, describes it as &quot;one of the single worst ideas in advertising history&quot; because consumers associate the word edible with &quot;barely.&quot; To overcome the egg's health stigma, Mr. Jordan says, it should be repositioned as the &quot;Elegant Egg.&quot;    Others blame the $3 billion industry for ignoring strategies successfully used with other foods. For example, single-serve packaging has swept supermarket shelves, but consumers generally still must buy eggs a dozen at a time. And despite the success of branded chicken, the egg industry has been slow to borrow a page from Frank Perdue's book.    Many egg farmers &quot;still think of their products as commodities -- that eggs from Maine, North Carolina or California are all the same,&quot; says J. Steve Davis, president of Altschiller Reitzfeld, a New York ad agency seeking to build a brand image for Ise Farms, a New Jersey egg producer. The agency's radio campaign features chickens clucking over the freshness of their eggs, which travel from farm to retailer in 24 hours.    Similarly, Ted Charron, president of Theodore Charron Advertising Inc., New York, thinks the industry should look closely at a regional television campaign he developed five years ago. At the time, the New England Brown Egg Council was desperately trying to fend off white eggs from the South and Midwest.    &quot;We appealed to a sense of logic and local chauvinism that says if eggs come from around here, they must be fresher than eggs from somewhere else,&quot; Mr. Charron says. Since they started running, the ads have boosted sales of brown eggs 5% to 10% a year in New England.    But no matter what the marketing twist, the egg's biggest drawback is that it remains an egg. So scientists and farmers are struggling to change it. They are questing after the long-shelf-life egg and the more-convenient-to-make, microwavable egg. Above all, they are seeking a low-cholesterol egg.    So far, results have been mixed. At Seaboard Farms in Lakewood, N.J., laying hens feasted last year on special feed containing seaweed extract. The experiment lowered the cholesterol level of the hens -- but not of their eggs.    Using another feed formula, Rosemary Farms in Santa Maria, Calif., has started rolling out an egg that it says has 55% less cholesterol than normal (though such claims are controversial). That's even lower than a rival product from Mr. Albright, the Lancaster, Pa., farmer, who gives his hens purified water and secret feed and has them bask under special lights to reduce their stress levels. He claims a 25% reduction in cholesterol.    Some companies are trying to take the state of the art in other directions. For example, C.R. Egg, a marketer in Jenkintown, Pa., says a kelp additive it uses in chicken feed yields eggs that have normal amounts of cholesterol -- but are guaranteed to reduce cholesterol in humans.    The kelp additive was developed by Mitsubishi Corp. in Japan, and eggs from chickens fed with it already are a brisk seller there, even though they cost three times more than ordinary eggs. C.R. Egg is awaiting Food and Drug Administration clearance of the kelp additive to begin testmarketing eggs in the U.S.    But even if the high-tech egg makes it to market, many producers question whether it will reverse the decline in egg consumption. Says Mr. Albright: &quot;What we need is a whole series of breakthroughs, from superstrong shells to oblong yolks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
