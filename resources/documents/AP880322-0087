The ministers of the 46-member Organization of IslamicConference said in a statement that ``all Moslems in the world areproud of this uprising.''   They called for political and financial aid for the rebellion. APalestine Liberation Organization official, speaking just before aplenary meeting at which the foreign ministers approved thestatement, hailed the support they were giving to the ``uprising.''   In another development, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in aclosed committee session claimed that Iran was facilitating theemigration of Iranian Jews to Israel. Iran has denied the charge.   Jordanian Foreign Minister Taher Masri said Iran and Iraq wereunlikely to negotiate on peace during the Amman meeting, in partbecause of the low-ranking level of the Iranian delegation.   The ministers in their statement said the conference ``denouncesthe oppressive and criminal measures by the (Israeli) authoritiesagainst our brothers, the people in the occupied territories.''   ``Members of the organization are concerned to supportPalestinians financially, politically and morally and also to backtheir sole legitimate representative, the PLO,'' the statement said.   It did not elaborate on the form this aid would take.   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of PLO's political department, theequivalent of the organization's foreign ministry, said theministers' backing was especially valuable ``for the people insidethe territories.''   He spoke the day after King Hussein, in an opening address atthe conference, called for the Moslem world to support the``uprising.''   More than 100 Palestinians have died in the violent protests inthe territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. Israelseized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.   Kaddoumi, who is heading the PLO's delegation at the Islamicmeeting, condemned U.S. moves to close the guerrilla group's officein New York, accredited to the United Nations.   ``We will keep the office open until American police come andseal it off,'' he said. ``Then we will go to the United Nations(enclave) and live there.''   Aziz, reading in a closed session a statement that was madeavailable to The Associated Press by a source close to theconference, said the alleged help given to Iranian Jews foremigration to Israel was ``a violation of the rules of the''organization.   He did not elaborate, but asked the organization to study thisissue from all sides.   ``How come Iran, which claims to support the Palestinian issueand the uprising, is helping Jews to migrate to Israel.''   He provided no figures on the migration. Iran has already deniedthe charge.</TEXT></DOC>
