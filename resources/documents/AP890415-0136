By the end of the week, the proposed sale of Eastern Airlineshad collapsed in failure, while a long-delayed settlement of civilcharges was reached between the government and Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   On the surface, the two events had nothing to do with each otherand shared more contrasts than similarities.   Eastern is a moneylosing business that has come to symbolizeairline deregulation at its worst and labor-management feuding atits most intractable. Drexel is a rough-and-tumble, moneymakingWall Street powerhouse that incited the use of junk bonds tofinance mergers, crossed the bounds of illegality and agreed to payfor it.   But underneath the differences lie some common threads: Both theEastern and Drexel stories are the outgrowth, directly andindirectly, of the 1980s debt-financed takeover decade.   Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo is a longtime Drexel client who usedits renowned prowess in high-yield, high-risk junk-bond market tohelp him finance his Texas Air Corp. airline empire.   Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball boss and Olympicsorganizer who offered to buy Eastern for $464 million, had plannedto use Drexel's junk-bond financing to complete the deal.   Ueberroth even had kind words for Michael Milken, thebillionaire Drexel banker who helped create the junk-bond marketand is now fighting criminal charges of securities fraud andracketeering that stem from a nearly 3-year-old federal crusadeagainst Wall Street corruption.   The charges facing Milken are the same that Drexel successfullydodged this past week via an unprecedented agreement negotiatedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission that will effectivelymake the firm a government-run business for three years.   Under terms of that pact, which will enable Drexel to pleadguilty to six felonies and pay a $650 million criminal fine in aseparate deal with the Justice Department, the firm will banishMilken and appoint as chairman a former SEC chief who presided overthe initial investigation into the firm in late 1986.   Moreover, Drexel will cooperate with federal probes into otherWall Street crimes, broadly restructure its business and let theSEC supervise every aspect of its trading and financial structure.   The Eastern and Drexel stories share another common element thathas yet to be played out: their shrinking size and influence.   Whether Eastern is sold or kept by Lorenzo, it is bound to bemuch smaller and has been hardly missed in the competitive airlinebrawl. Already rival American Airlines has moved aggressively intomarkets vacated by Eastern and has expressed interest in buyingsome of its assets.   Drexel, though it remains a leader in the junk-bond market, hasconceded losing hundreds of millions of dollars in business becauseof the federal fraud probe and now faces the prospect of competingas an admitted felon, without the enormous clout wielded by Milken.   _Exxon Corp. faced more criticism and a toughened governmentattitude over its handling of the nation's largest oil spill from agrounded company tanker in the Prince William Sound of Alaska.Federal officials took over the supervision of the disaster andordered the oil giant to produce a detailed cleanup plan.   _Government statistics on the economy injected more confusioninto the financial markets and the direction of interest rates _the cost of money. The trade deficit widened in February from aflood of imports, implying more inflation and higher interestrates. Wholesale prices in March rose moderately, suggestinginflation is easing. Business inventories rose in February andsales fell, suggesting production cutbacks and an economic decline.   _Real and attempted takeovers swept the banking, drug, computerand chicken businesses. Banking company NCNB Corp. pressed itseffort to buy Citizens andamp; Southern Corp.; pharmaceutical giantsSmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham Group PLC of Britain agreed tomerge, creating what would be the biggest drug company behind Merckand Co.; Hewlett-Packard Inc. agreed to buy Apollo Computer Inc.; andHolly Farms Corp. shareholders voted on a proposed merger withConAgra Inc.
