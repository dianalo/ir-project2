 Someone in the marketing departmentrecognized that data already held in a database could be marketedto computer users at a premium price.andP;  This led to a wide varietyof smaller on-line databases providing specialized data for aprice.andP;  Specialized users who could make full use of the datafound this acceptable.andP;  Database firms connected several suchservices on one database to accommodate the more general user.andO;Then third-party groups moved into the market to offer hostservices, often as a part of electronic mail services.andP;  The marketis growing rapidly for reasonably-priced services.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Data CommunicationsOn-LineInformation ServicesModemsUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>User to User THE COMMS COLUMSandM;Everyone who owns a modem knows that they have access to vast amounts ofinformation from all over the globe--they probably remember reading it on thebox they got the modem in.andP;  What's not quite as clear is how to get at thatinformation without breaking the bank, since the expense of most on-lineservices is also legendary.andM;To understand why on-line services are expensive, you have to understandwhere they came from.andP;  Many such services started as an expansion of theinternal activity of a specialist company.andP;  Some bright spark in themarketing department would realize that the information already hld on adatabase could be sold to anybody with a modem and a PC att a premium price.andM;This simple discovery led to a proliferation of small on-line databases whichprovided high-value information on subjects as varied as law, finance,agriculture or market research.andP;  In order to protect the information,suppliers tended to charge high subscription costs as well as on-line chargesto users.andM;For very specialist users, who could realize the full value of a service,this was acceptable.andP;  But it also left a lot of potential 'browsers' out inthe cold--who wants to dig into their pocket to meet a subscription chargerunning into thousands of pounds, just to find out how many refrigeratorswere sold in Norway last year?andM;To accommodate these more general users, database companies like ICC createda series of on-line services linked together in a single database--there wasonly one subscription charge to meet across several related subject areas.andM;In the final stage of the on-line service's development, larger third partyorganizations have moved in to provide host services to the many kinds ofsmaller on-line services already established.andP;  These access points are oftenhitched on to the back of email facilities, since this allows a basicsubscription charge to be hidden as part of a service.andM;In the UK, the best known of the email-based host services is probably BT'sTelecom Gold.andP;  The on-line information Gold has traditionally offered hasbeen collected and input by Gold itself, although it has always offeredgateways to major services like the US-based Official Airline Guide (OAG).andO;Telecom Gold is now spreading this gateway principle to include many moreservices.andM;For example, ICC, which is itself a database provider offering severaldifferent services, is now directly available to any Gold user.andP;  This meansthe full range of information supplied by ICC is available, rather than acut-down and edited version of the same thing--although ICC has still chosento retain some advantage by making information which is less than a month oldavailable to direct subscribers only.andM;But one of the problems with the gateway approach is its lack of consistency.andO;Each computer system has a slightly different way of extracting information.andO;When users are using a wide range of services, the difficulty and expense oflearning at connection rates of between 80p and 5 pounds a minute becomes abig problem.andP;  Small efforts such as the standardization of log-off commandsacross all databases only scratch at the surface.andM;Luxembourg-based Infotap has approached the whole problem from a differentdirection.andP;  Like Telecom Gold, it's offering a wide range of services througha series of gateways running on the back of an existing electronic mailservice.andP;  'Intelligent information' is accessible through the PSS network anduses the Geonet Intermail service.andP;  Unlike Gold, Infotap has introduced itsown layer of software between each individual on-line database and the userandM;This software provides a uniform environment for users--the same commands areused to select subjects and search criteria, whichever of the nine majorEuropean on-line host services you're interested in.andP;  So the learning problemis reduced to the absolute minimum.andP;  And because the system brings togethernot just individual databases, but the host services they run on, it canoffer what, in quasi-religious terminology, is called a 'host of hosts'.andO;Alleluia!andM;The II Software also reduces expensive on-line time.andP;  For example, if youwant references to a particular subject and date, the software works out whatto ask for before connecting to the on-line service.andP;  It then automaticallyruns the interrogation in the shortest possible time and returns the resultsto you.andM;For users with communications software which can be automated (likeCrosstalk) it's rather like writing a special script routine for each serviceyou use so that you can reduce the on-line time to an absolute minimum.andP;  Theresult is dramatically reduced on-line time and commensurately reducedon-line costs.andM;It isn't yet possible to compile these off-line search criteria for more thanone of the databases at a time, but II plans to develop software which willallow multiple host searching.andP;  This means that users would be able to askfor all references to 'Italy', 'ice cream' and 'mergers', and get theinformation held on any number of separate databases on that topic.andM;Such an application would show the true power of such a service.andP;  It wouldn'tonly reduce on-line costs, but would also draw different databases togetherinto one single coherent system--an attractive idea.andM;The number of companies which are no longer physically close to traditionalinformation sources like business libraries is growing.andP;  So is the need forreasonably priced on-line information which is easy to get at--and that's themarket being wooed by services like II and Telecom Gold.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
