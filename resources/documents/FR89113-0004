This final rule would not result in an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or localgovernment agencies or geographical regions; or have significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Currently less than 2,000 exoticanimals are slaughtered annually compared to over 32,000,000 cattle slaughteredin fiscal year 1986. It is not expected that the number of exotic animalsslaughtered annually will substantially increase. In addition, since thisis a voluntary fee-for-service program, producers must decide if the abilityto market a federally inspected product offsets the resulting costs ofinspection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities </ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined bythe Regulatory Flexibility Act, (5 U.S.C. 601). Since the voluntary inspectionservice for some exotic animals, with the exception of American bison,catalo, and cattalo, is not yet provided, FSIS does not have specific informationon how many small entities may be affected by this final rule. However,FSIS believes that those producers of exotic animals who would be interestedin participating in this voluntary inspection service are small in actualnumbers and are small businesses. This assumption is based on the limitednumber of commercially raised exotic animals and the size of the herdsof the animals now being commercially produced in the United States. Thisrule is expected to have an impact on all exotic animal producers who wishto have their products federally inspected because it will enable suchproducers to market their products as federally inspected. In determiningwhether to participate in this voluntary program, each producer decidesif the ability to market a federally inspected product offsets the resultingcosts of inspection. In addition, FSIS believes that a substantial numberof those establishments which may choose to participate in the program,that is, agree to use their establishments for the preparation under officialinspection of carcasses, meat, and products of exotic animals, will alsobe small businesses. This assumption is based on the fact that the locationswhere exotic animals are commercially produced are generally in remoteareas where few large establishments are located. Each establishment willdecide if such use of its facility and equipment is economically advantageous.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended, provides the Secretaryof Agriculture with the authority to furnish a voluntary inspection service,on a fee basis, for exotic animals (7 U.S.C. 1622). Under Parts 350 and352 of the regulations (9 CFR Parts 350 and 352) promulgated under thatAct, the Department provides inspection and certification services forreindeer and American bison, catalo, and cattalo, respectively. These inspectionservices enable persons to have ante-mortem and post-mortem inspectionperformed on these exotic animals. The inspected and passed meat is brandedwith a USDA mark of inspection and can be sold interstate or exported.The increasing consumer demand for exotic animal meat and the increasingnumber of exotic animals being raised for food prompted exotic animal producersto request the adoption of similar regulations for the inspection and markingof these animals and their meat products as are currently provided forAmerican bison, catalo, and cattalo. Therefore, on February 24, 1988, FSIS published a proposed rule (53 FR5387) to add other exotic animal species to Part 352 which provided onlyfor the voluntary inspection of American bison, catalo, and cattalo. FSISproposed to add elk, deer, antelope, and water buffalo to Part 352 andto transfer reindeer from Part 350 to Part 352 to consolidate the provisionsfor voluntary inspection of all exotic animals. To avoid confusion, FSISproposed to redefine buffalo as animals belonging to the buffalo familyand bison as animals belonging to the bison family. This final rule allows the following three alternative locations for ante-morteminspection of reindeer, elk, deer, antelope, and water buffalo, which arepresently allowed for American bison, catalo, and cattalo: (1) in the fieldin a designated area of an owner's premises; (2) on an appropriate transportvehicle at an official exotic animal establishment; and (3) in ante-mortempens at an official exotic animal establishment. The ante-mortem inspectionperformed on reindeer, elk, deer, antelope, water buffalo, and bison whichis either in the field or on a transport vehicle will be dependent on theadequacy and safety of the particular situation. Humane handling of exoticanimals during ante-mortem inspection will be in accordance with andSection;313.2 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 313.2) which prescribesvarious methods of humane slaughter. The post-mortem inspection procedure will be performed in an official exoticanimal establishment by a USDA inspector or an inspector of a cooperatingState, with the post-mortem disposition determined by the authorized veterinarian.The final rule allows the utilization of Federal and State meat inspectionpersonnel for ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of reindeer, elk,deer, antelope, water buffalo, and bison. The triangular brand was designed not only to identify inspected and passedbison and bison meat food products under FSIS's voluntary inspection service,but was also designed to identify meat of other exotic animals approvedfor inspection at a future date. The triangular brand will be applied tothese specific exotic animal carcasses, meat and meat food products inspectedand passed by authorized USDA or State employees in an official exoticanimal establishment. The ordering and manufacture of the triangular brandwill be in accordance with the provisions contained in andSection; 317.3(c)of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.3). <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The Agency received eight comments in response to the proposal. Four commenterssupported the proposal; four opposed it. One of the four opposing commentersprovided no additional comment. The remaining three opposing commentersfelt the proposal would permit the slaughter of game animals, thereby encouragingpoaching in the wild which would decrease the numbers of such animals.The Agency wishes to emphasize that the proposal was a result of requestsfrom exotic animal producers (persons who are involved in the raising and/ormarketing of exotic animals for commercial purposes) that the Agency provideFederal inspection of the slaughter and other preparation of elk, deer,antelope, reindeer and water buffalo. The rule provides for ante-morteminspection (inspection before slaughter) by an FSIS inspector at a producer'spremises, on a transport vehicle, or at an official exotic animal establishment.With regard to exotic animals in the wild, it would be very difficult ifnot impossible to trap and remove an exotic animal from the wild withouttranquilizing the animal. Because animals which have been treated withtranquilizers are not permitted for slaughter, any person who attemptedsuch action would gain nothing for their efforts. Therefore, this regulationwould have no affect on poaching.For the reasons discussed in the preamble, FSIS is amending Parts 350 and352 of the Federal meat inspection regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Parts 350 and 352</ITAG>Meat inspection, Voluntary inspection, Exotic animals, Food labeling.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 350_SPECIAL SERVICES RELATING TO MEAT AND OTHER PRODUCTS</ITAG>1.
