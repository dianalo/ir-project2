(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh todayfiled an unprecendented national security declaration that couldkill the Iran-Contra criminal case against a former CIA stationchief.   For the first time, the government invoked a provision offederal law to bar disclosure of certain classified information, astep that could lead to dismissal of criminal charges againstJoseph Fernandez.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-Contraprosecutor, immediately deplored the move, accusing Thornburgh in astatement of trying to protect ``fictional secrets'' in a way thatcould block the trial from going forward.   Thornburgh's action was disclosed at a pre-trial proceedingbefore U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton. The judge scheduledanother court session for Friday morning to provide an opportunityto review the declaration.   As CIA station chief in Costa Rica, Fernandez assisted WhiteHouse aide Oliver North's secret Contra resupply network at a timewhen Congress had banned military assistance to the Nicaraguanrebels by U.S. intelligence agencies.   Fernandez is accused of obstructing the CIA inspector general'soffice and the Tower Commission that investigated the Iran-Contraaffair and of making false statements about his activities onbehalf of North.   Evidence that Fernandez plans to use in his defense would cause``serious damage to the national security of the United States,''Thornburgh said in a statement.   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Associate independent counselLaurence Shtasel said ``we are disappointed that the affidavit isextremely broad'' and blocks the disclosure of ``information thatis generally known to the public.''   ``An important prosecution is at stake,'' Shtasel said. ``JosephFernandez is the highest-ranking CIA official ever indicted.''   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the departmentbelieves the Fernandez case still can be brought to trial, despitethe declaration.   Ron Noble, a deputy assistant attorney general in thedepartment's criminal division, said there is ``always apossibility'' that the government can come up with a way to bringat least some of the charges against Fernandez.   ``It is my abiding sense that further judicial examination ...will establish the potential for accommodating both the defendant'srights and the national security interests at stake, therebyallowing this case to be tried to conclusion,'' Thornburgh said inhis statement, which Noble read in court.   Fernandez's lawyer, Thomas Wilson, said the ``sword ofDamocles'' had been hanging over his client's head for three yearsand that Hilton should dismiss the case now that the declarationhas been filed.   Lawyers in Walsh's office asked the judge to let them respond inwriting before he makes a decision on any national securityaffidavit filed by the department.   After the hearing, Walsh issued a statement saying, ``We deplorethe fact that the attorney general for the first time has filed anaffidavit to protect fictional secrets which could prevent thetrial of a former high-ranking CIA official.''   In July, Hilton said Fernandez must be allowed to present in hisdefense details concerning CIA programs in Costa Rica and thelocations of agency stations in Honduras and El Salvador.   Fernandez was to have gone to trial July 24, but Hilton rejecteda proposal by prosecutors that would have limited disclosure of theclassified material.   The Justice Department sought to appeal Hilton's rulings to theU.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., but that effort failed.   Meanwhile, businessman Albert Hakim pleaded guilty Tuesday to amisdemeanor while one of his corporations used to divert arms saleprofits pleaded guilty to a felony.   The Iranian-born Hakim said in court that he helped pay for asecurity fence at North's home with money from ``the Enterprise,''the complex of foreign companies Hakim operated in the Iran-Contrascandal.   Lake Resources Inc., a Swiss company used as a conduit for Iranarms sale money and aid to the Contras, pleaded guilty to theft ofgovernment property, a felony carrying a maximum penalty of up to$500,000. Hakim, who faces sentencing Feb. 1, was the principalshareholder in Lake Resources.   The plea agreement says that from late 1985 to November 1986,Hakim, his business partner Richard Secord, North and nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter used their influence ``to generateand divert approximately $16.2 million ... to Enterprise bankaccounts.''   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell accepted the agreement aftermeeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys.</TEXT></DOC>
