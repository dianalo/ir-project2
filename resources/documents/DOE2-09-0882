Admin. Code,Title 35, Subtitle C, Water Pollution Rules and Regulations of the PollutionControl Board.

The Citymaintained that compliance would require the construction of 5.1 milliodollar plant (1983 estimate) and result in no environmental benefit.As an alternative the City proposed to construct a 2.5 million dollarfacility and request site specific exemption to the existing standards.In addition to the two alternatives proposed by Tuscola, the report examinestwo other wastewater management strategies. These strategies includeda slow rate land treatment system and the construction of conventionalfacilities with a level of treatment falling between the two conventionaloptions proposed by Tuscola.
