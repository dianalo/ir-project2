The hospital, TMCare Corp.'s Tucson Medical Center, and the physician groups filed suit last Friday in state court in Tucson &quot;as a last-resort measure,&quot; said a hospital spokesman. Maxicare, based in Los Angeles, has a &quot;history of running behind on payments,&quot; he added.    A Maxicare spokeswoman said the HMO sent $750,000 to the hospital last week and will be sending another $200,000 in a few days. The HMO has recently come under new management, which is &quot;trying to deal with the backlog,&quot; she said.    TMCare has made two offers since June to acquire Maxicare's membership and assets in Tucson. Maxicare rejected both offers, the hospital spokesman said. The Maxicare spokeswoman, who said the plan has about 55,000 members, declined to comment further. </TEXT></DOC>
