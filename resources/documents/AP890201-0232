CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Another religious voice _ this time from U.S. andLatin American Methodist bishops _ has sounded a plea to governmentsto keep hands off Nicaragua and be ``peacemakers and notpeacebreakers.''   After extensive talks there, the bishops this week declared``peace with justice'' is possible, but must recognize ``eachnation's right to determine its own destiny'' without interference.   This is a long standing demand of most major Christianleadership, Protestant and Roman Catholic, in opposing outsidemililtary intervention in strife-torn Central America.   President Bush says review of policy there and elsewhere still isto be completed and it takes ``a little time,'' particularly sincehe wants a ``bilaterally supported policy'' there.   His chosen secretary of state, James A. Baker III, says hedoesn't think that ``on humanitarian grounds or moral grounds we canabandon the Contras,'' but should go slow on any more military aidto the rebel group.   ``I think it's very, very, important that we move in a unifiedway here,'' he said.   These remarks last week _ Bush in a news conference and Baker toa Senate committee _ indicated new efforts to avoid the past keenpartisan conflict over the matter, and possibly new approaches to it.   Bishop Kenneth W. Hicks of Topeka, Kan., among those visitingNicaragua, expressed hope the Bush administration will take a``diplomatic rather than confrontational approach'' toward Nicaragua.   This has been a drawn-out, keenly divisive issue in America,engendering demonstrations, passions on right and left, longcongressional battles and narrow votes.   It has involved secret CIA mining of Nicaragua's harbor, U.S.provisions of arms to Contra rebels, and after such aid wassuspended, a scandal over continuing it through illegal militarysales to Iran.   During the eight-year civil war there since the Sandinistastoppled a 40-year dictatorship, both mainline Protestantdenominations and the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have steadilyopposed outside military intervention.   The Methodist bishops _ 16 from the U.S. United Methodist Churchand 15 from Latin American countries _ condemned the ``violence andviolations against the people'' of Central American nations asmaking peace impossible.   In a ``declaration of peace and solidarity'' issued last Sundayin Nicaragua's capital, Managua, after five days of discussions witha wide range of Nicaraguans, high and low, the bishops pledged:   ``We will demand and expect that our governments act withcompassion and justice. ... We will publicly challenge ourgovernments to be peacemakers and not peacebreakers. ...   ``We will work for the development of policies that respect thesovereign rights of other nations to govern themselves withoutinterference.''   The bishops, representing the U.S. Council of United MethodistBishops and the Episcopal Council of Methodist Churches in LatinAmerica, said they have seen Nicaragua's war devastation and theyurged negotiated settlements.   Similar stands have been taken over the years by various mainlinedenominations, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopal and other bodies,as well as by the Protestant-Orthodox National Council of Churchesand Catholic bishops.   They have supported U.S. humanitarian aid, but not militarysupplies. The national council's governing board said last May suchaid should be ``offered impartially, strictly on the basis of need,free from extraneous objective.''   Monsignor Daniel Hoye, secretary of the U.S. Catholic Conference,says the bishops object to any aid to the Contras except suchhumanitarian aid as food, clothing and resettlement assistance whilethe peace process develops.   The Methodist bishops added another point, noting crippling debtsof Central American countries and urging ``swift renegotiation ofthese debts with favorable terms,'' or total debt forgiveness.   Hicks said, ``The United States has a marvelous opportunity tohelp a country find its way. For eight years our policy has beenthat help must conform to our provisions and Nicaragua is notwilling to do that.   ``If we want them to move out of the Marxist bloc then we have totreat them as equals ... instead of as underprivileged children thatneed to be disciplined and chastized.''   Bishop C. P. Minnick of Raleigh, N.C., said there was confusionamong Nicaraguans about why the United States as ``one nation underGod'' would stand by and send no aid after the recent destructivehurricane.   However, he said the country seems more relaxed than when hevisited there with a fact-finding church delegation in 1985. ``Nowthere is not as much anxiety about terrorist (Contra) activity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Feb. 3.</NOTE></DOC>
