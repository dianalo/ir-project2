The military launched the attacks after the defense chief saidthe dissidents had killed a general they took captive and may havekilled a second officer.   The government sent the helicopters in the wake of its groundattack earlier Saturday with recoilless rifles and automatic weaponsthat failed to dislodge up to 60 Moslems from the garrison. Therewere no immediate reports on casualties from Saturday's assaults.   Before the ground attack, Brig. Gen. Braulio Balbas saidgovernment forces hoped to capture the renegades and regain fullcontrol of the garrison by the end of the day.   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ruled out furthernegotiations with the Moslems, saying they killed at least one oftwo hostages taken Thursday in this Mindanao Island city about 560miles south of Manila.   But Mayor Vitaliano Agan said the leader of the dissidents,Patrolman Rizal Alih, sent word through relatives that he wanted tosurrender.   Alih and about 14 supporters seized the camp's headquartersbuilding on Thursday and took Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, regionalcommander of the Philippine Constabulary, and his chief of staffCol. Romeo Abendan hostage after eight of them were ordered tosurrender and face murder charges in a 1984 incident.   Dozens of Moslem soldiers and others joined Alih's group, usingweapons looted from the camp armory.   On Friday, de Villa ordered his troops to storm the garrisonafter he received reports that Batalla had been slain by his captors.   De Villa said he also feared Abendan had been killed.   During Friday's attack, tanks and armored personnel carriers,with guns blazing, smashed through the gates ahead of marines andcommandos flown here from Manila.   But the troops were forced to withdraw after the Moslems returnedfire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers. They disabled atleast one armored vehicle.   Officials said at least five people were wounded in Friday'sattack. Balbas said the Moslems had suffered casualties too, but hewas unable to give a figure because sniper fire prevented troopsfrom canvassing the grounds.   De Villa said troops monitoring the captors' radio communicationsheard them chanting Moslem prayers associated with imminent deathand concluded the gunmen were ready to die rather than surrender.   ``They're ready to run amok,'' de Villa said. ``They will notleave that place anymore. They will die fighting.''   But Agan quoted Alih's relatives as saying Alih wanted tosurrender to the mayor and a Moslem city official because he hadlost two brothers in Friday's fighting.   Negotiations broke down Friday after Alih failed to provideevidence that Batalla was alive. Alih had said the general was safe,but de Villa told reporters Friday that Batalla was probably killedThursday when the hostage incident began.   Alih was charged but acquitted in the November 1984 slaying ofMayor Cesar Climaco. Three weeks after Climaco's death, seven peoplewere killed in a marine raid on Alih's home.   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batallareceived permission to arrest Alih. Batalla ordered Alih and eightothers detained. All of them could be charged with murder orconspiracy to commit murder.   In an apparently unrelated incident, military sources said sixmarines were killed and two others were wounded Saturday during anattack by Moslem rebels on Basilan island, about 10 miles to thesouth.   A military report said two rebels were also slain.   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which haspopulation of 59 million. Half of Zamboanga's residents areChristian and half Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
