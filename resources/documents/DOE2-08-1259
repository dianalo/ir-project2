<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-1259 </DOCNO><TEXT>Describes two improved versions of bridging a bucket wheel excavator toa boom spreader for overburden removal in brown coal surface mines. Thepresent design of bulk transfer is based on free bulk fall from the excavatorboom onto the spreader boom, which, however, is difficult to maintainduring equipment movement along mine benches. A fixed connection betweenexcavator and spreader is the preferred design. A fixed connection requiresslewable telescopic booms in order to secure equipment mobility. TheTAKRAF manufacturer (GDR) developed a fixed bulk transfer system withtelescopic excavator loading boom in versions with and without an additionaltransfer bridge. The technological advantage of the version with transferbridge is the possibility of separating excavator and spreader for ashort time at bench ends, while the excavator boom is carried by thetransfer bridge. The version without transfer bridge requires provisionof an auxiliary crawler support for resting the boom while the excavatoris disconnected from the spreader. Schemes and diagrams of the designare provided. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
