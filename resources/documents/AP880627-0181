Richard Narkewicz, president of the 34,000-member AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, said he has written a letter to CarnationPresident Timm F. Crull, saying, ``Any attempt to dissuade mothersfrom breast-feeding by advertising infant formula directly to thepublic would be strongly condemned by the academy.''   Infant-formula makers have traditionally refrained fromadvertising directly to the public, and the academy's longstandingpolicy has been to oppose such advertising, Narkewicz said.   The academy's opposition stems from its concern that suchproduct promotion may encourage women to use formula rather than tobreast-feed their infants, Narkewicz said.   ``Quite frankly,'' Narkewicz said, ``if breast-feeding is thebest, and you've got a multimillion-dollar promotion for formula,who's going to put up the dough to advertise that breast-feeding isbest? Nobody.''   At a press conference in New York Monday, Carnation announcedthe introduction of an infant formula that the company says willhelp some infants who are allergic to existing formulas.   Carnation spokesman Richard Curd said the company plans aninformation campaign to alert the public to the problem ofinfant-formula allergies. He said the ads will mention Carnation,not the new product.   The formula, called Good Start H.A., is a whey-based,predigested product that Carnation says will not cause allergies insome children who are allergic to conventional cow's milk formulasor formulas made from soybean proteins.   Dr. Richard Hamburger, a professor of pediatrics at theUniversity of California, San Diego, who spoke at the pressconference on the company's behalf, said perhaps 8 percent of U.S.children are allergic to both milk-based and soy-based infantformulas, the two most commonly used in the United States.   Some children who are allergic to both kinds of formula _ whichcontain whole proteins _ may not be allergic to Good Start H.A.,which contains proteins that are broken down, said Hamburger.   Hamburger and Narkewicz both emphasized that breast-feeding ispreferred over the use of infant formula.   Dr. William Weil, a professor of pediatrics at Michigan StateUniversity and former member of the American Academy of Pediatrics'nutrition committee, said that as many as 90 percent of childrenmay have some food disorder at some time, but that formula allergyis not usually the cause.   Of the Carnation product, he said, ``It does not sound to melike they've come up with anything in the way of a breakthrough forfeeding problems in infancy.''   Adele Haley, a pharmaceutical business securities analyst forSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said Carnation made a ``less thanconvincing'' argument that it has a significantly different product.   Ernie Strapazon, assistant general manager of Carnation'sNutritional Products Division, said: ``The company has developed aninformation campaign for Good Start H.A. targeted at consumers andfocusing on formula intolerance symptoms. The message will directconsumers to their pediatrician for the solution to problems ofinfant formula intolerance caused by cow's milk-based or soy-basedformulas.''   Narkewicz, a South Burlington, Vt., pediatrician, expressedconcern that the academy's nutrition committee had no opportunityto examine the product.   ``When we learn what this formula is, we will have our committeelook at it and see _ does it satisfy the standards,'' Narkewiczsaid from Chicago, where he was attending a meeting of the AmericanMedical Association.   ``But I'll tell you one thing: We are going to strongly fightthem if they are advertising infant formula directly to thepublic.''   Several Carnation officials, including Crull and Strapazon, wereaboard a plane from New York to Los Angeles and could not bereached for a response to Narkewicz, said Paulette Barrett ofEdelman Public Relations in New York, the agency that organized thepress conference.</TEXT></DOC>
