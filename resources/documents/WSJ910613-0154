In fact, it is these young, rapidlygrowing trees that generate oxygen at a much greater ratethan older, &quot;mature&quot; forests. The greenhouse effect would bea much more ominous threat without them. Trees are harvestedjust as corn or wheat, or any other crop. Is anyone out thereconcerned about how many cornstalks are destroyed to make thecorn muffins we consume at breakfast?   Nathaniel Springer</LP><TEXT>   President   Baldwin Paper Co.   New York   ---   Your article discusses the selling of mailing lists, andimplies such sales are made only to other environmentalorganizations. In fact, lists are often sold to organizationswhose purpose has no direct relationship to that of theoriginal owner of the list.   As a kind of informal poll, I use distinct mailingaddresses in buying subscriptions and making charitabledonations. I misspell my name, add a job title or modify mylaboratory's acronym, and when the misspelling shows up inother solicitations, I know who sold my name.   The most prolific purveyor of my identity is theEnvironmental Defense Fund, which has sold my name to otherenvironmental groups, but also to groups such as PlannedParenthood and Handgun Control Inc. EDF seemingly assumesindividuals who either respect human life or defend theSecond Amendment would not be environmentalists. Also, theseother groups often use plastic address windows and othermaterials that are difficult to recycle.   Conversely, there are groups that preserved my privacy:the American Cetacean Society, the Glenmary Missionaries andthe National Rifle Association.   The jury is still out on the Cousteau Society.
