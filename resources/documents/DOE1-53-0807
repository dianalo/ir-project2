The least square technique is used to estimate the systematicerrors of fitted results of single peak and complex spectra acquiredwith the ADCs which have some kinds of channel profiles specially chosento obtain the desired results. A more practical specification of DNL,small interval differential nonlinearity, is proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
