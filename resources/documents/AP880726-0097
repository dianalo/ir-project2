Richard Lugar ofIndiana told reporters. ``He voted consistently in support in thepast.''   ``My guess is there will be a lot of criticism of Sen. Bentsenif he abstains or doesn't vote on the Contra aid package,'' hesaid. ``He has stood for that and been part of the bipartisancoalition and to suddenly opt out now would be very strange.''   Bentsen has supported President Reagan's requests for aid to theContra rebels in the past. A forthcoming vote that is expected inthe Senate would be his first opportunity to cast a vote on theissue since becoming the running-mate of Democratic presidentialnominee Dukakis, who opposes Contra aid.   Lugar commented after a meeting of GOP congressional leaderswith the president at the White House.   He said the Contra issue was discussed and ``there was a generalconsensus that the legislation ought to proceed.''   He said there was no discussion of figures.   ``We believe there ought to be military assistance,'' Lugarsaid. ``We believe those funds will bring about some credibility innegotiations.''   ``Without there being humanitarian assistance, at least withsome military on the way if it doesn't work out, the thing reallywon't accomplish what we want,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
