The 19-member delegation will remain in Israel until the fivehijackers, who seized a busload of children and then traded thecargo for a plane and $3.3 million ransom, are extradited. Israelhas not announced a decision on extradition but has indicated itwill comply with the Soviet request.   The hijackers were held in a prison near Tel Aviv pending a finaldecision on extradition. A spokesman at Ben-Gurion Airport near thiscoastal city said the captured eight-member crew would leave for theSoviet Union on Sunday.   State-run Israel radio said the Soviet delegation includes policeinvestigators and doctors who will examine the hijackers and crew.   ``Some officials from the Soviet Union have come to pick up thehijackers,'' said Motti Amihai, a spokesman for the ForeignMinistry. ``But there has been no final decision on the Israeliside.'' He added, ``Our policy is we don't see any reason to keepthe hijackers.''   Israel has no extradition treaty with the Soviet Union, but bothnations have signed international agreements on punishing andextraditing hijackers.   In Moscow, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Boris N. Chaplin saidhis country was grateful to Israel ``for their understanding on thismatter.'' Some Israeli observers said cooperation on the hijackingcould accelerate the process of reconciliation between the countries.   The hijackers, four men and a woman, surrendered to Israelipolice and freed the crew Friday evening after landing atBen-Gurion. The surrender came at 6:15 p.m., 35 minutes after theAeroflot Ilyushin-76 set down.   The five Soviets stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffedwith money, then dumped coins and paper bills _ most of it inAmerican currency _ onto the tarmac to show they weren't carryingexplosives.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the hijackers had a sawed-offshotgun and four pistols. But one of the hostages, flight engineerYuri N. Yermilov, said the hijackers were not threatening and seemed``quite good-natured.''   ``They were five simple criminals who wanted to flee the SovietUnion,'' Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said at animpromptu news conference a few yards from the jet.   Military vehicles surrounded the plane, which sat under the glareof a yellow searchlight.   The episode began Thursday, according to Soviet officials inMoscow.   They said hijackers seized a bus with 30 school-children and ateacher that day and demanded a plane to take them out of thecountry. The bus seizure occurred in Ordzhonikidze, a city 900 milessoutheast of Moscow.   In addition to giving the hijackers a plane and a flight crew,the government handed over 2 million rubles, worth about $3.3million, and some food in return for release of the children andteacher.   Chaplin and Vitaly A. Ponomarev, deputy KGB chief, said theSoviet leadership including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had beenkept closely informed of details of the operation.   Ponomarev identified the ringleader as 38-year-old Pavel L.Yakshiants and said he was a drug-user who first asked to go toPakistan.   Israeli soldiers said much of the money carried by the hijackerswas U.S. currency. The soldiers helped scoop it up after it wasdumped on the ground, and the hijackers held tightly to the bags asthey were led to the Abu Kabir prison near Tel Aviv.   Israel radio said the hijack team was made up of two Russians,two Armenians and a person from the Soviet Ossetian republic nearTurkey.   The Soviets broke diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967Middle East war when Israel seized lands from Moscow's Arab allies.   A gradual thaw in relations began in July 1987 when the SovietUnion sent a consular delegation to Tel Aviv. Israel set up adelegation in Moscow in April.</TEXT></DOC>
