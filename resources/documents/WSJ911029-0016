The study by the Office for Technology Assessment citedbiotechnology as &quot;one of the keys to U.S. competitivenessduring the years ahead,&quot; but acknowledged that many earlyclaims about the industry were &quot;premature.&quot; It emphasizedthat the competitiveness of U.S. innovation could very wellrely on the &quot;ability of biotechnology companies to stay inbusiness.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The study estimated that as much as $5 billion to $10billion may be needed to develop the 100 or so biotechnologyproducts currently in human clinical trials. &quot;A bottleneck isdeveloping as start-up companies attempt to move forwardtoward development, testing and marketing -- the expensivepart of the process,&quot; the study said.   Asked to comment on the conclusions, John Wilkerson of theWilkerson Group, a biotechnology consultant, said, &quot;The issueisn't start-up capital; it is capital for the later stages ofdevelopment.&quot;   &quot;There's never any shortage of founders, but investors forfollow-on rounds are hard to find,&quot; he said. As companies getcloser to clinical trials and to the actual manufacture andmarketing of drugs, their needs escalate enormously, headded.   To be sure, biotechnology companies this year have raisedan estimated $2.7 billion through stock and debt offerings,an amount that has more than met the industry's short-termneeds, said Stelios Papadopoulos, a managing director ofPaineWebber Inc. &quot;The funding gap was far more severe ninemonths ago,&quot; he added.   Still, Mr. Papadopoulos believes that new biotechnologystart-ups and new products will create an even greater needfor financing in the future. &quot;Capital will continue to be avaluable and scarce resource for the industry,&quot; he said.   Many new biotechnology companies in their search forcapital will face mergers or acquisitions, the OTA studynoted. &quot;What concerns some observers is the role that foreignacquisition and investment will play in the fate of many ofthese vulnerable firms,&quot; the study said. However, it addedthat &quot;there is insufficient evidence to state that U.S.commercial interests in biotechnology are threatened byforeign acquisition.&quot;   The study noted that the patent application backlog at thePatent and Trademark Office, domestic and internationaluncertainties regarding what constitutes patentable subjectmatter, procedural distinctions in U.S. law and the spate ofpatent infringement litigation all are unsettled areas thatcould affect incentives for developing new inventions.   &quot;Biotechnology companies largely confront the sameregulatory, intellectual property and trade policies faced byother U.S. high-technology firms . . . but to date federalagencies have not seen the need to revolutionize theirpractices for biotechnology,&quot; the study said. Moreover,mechanisms established to provide federal coordination ofactivities related to biotechnology instead have become thecenter of interagency ideological disputes over the scope ofproposed regulations, the study contended.   A recent survey by the Pharmaceutical ManufacturersAssociation found that 21 new biotechnology drugs havecompleted clinical trials and are awaiting approval. Anadditional 111 are currently being tested in humans. But thetrade group and other industry observers say that resourcesat the Food and Drug Administration -- both in terms ofscientists and funding -- are not adequate to &quot;provideexpeditious approval of important new drugs.&quot; Thebiotechnology research pipeline is on the &quot;brink of abottleneck,&quot; said Thomas L. Copmann, assistant vice presidentat the association.   While it is true that the FDA lacks the resources todevote all the necessary attention to critical new drugs,&quot;they have, nonetheless, worked out methods to grease thepipeline for dramatically effective therapeutics,&quot; said RogerLongman, editor of In Vivo, a Norwalk, Conn., biotechnologynewsletter. The success of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Videxis one such example, he noted.   Mr. Longman is convinced that the FDA is not the problemthat the study makes it out to be. There's no question thatthe FDA could be further streamlined to make the regulatoryprocess less onerous and less costly, he said. Still, hebelieves, &quot;many companies are not doing all that they can doto approach the regulators nor are they crafting the mosteffective financing strategies to carry them through theprocess.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
