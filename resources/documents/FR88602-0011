On June 15, 1983,the Department revoked the notice of effective date of the interim rule(48 FR 27528) and issued a notice that it was treating the published interimrule as a proposed rule and extending the comment period to September 6,1983 (48 FR 27529).HUD received a total of 1,273 comments on the proposed rule. The Departmentread and analyzed each comment, whether received before or after the formalcomment period expired on September 6, 1983. Over 800 of these commentsconsisted of six groups of form comments, leaving over 400 separate comments,many of which are lengthy and detailed. The Department prepared a comprehensivesummary of the public comments for its internal use in reviewing and consideringthe numerous comments received in preparation of the final rule. Becausethe issues raised in both the proposed rule and the comments are complexand because there is a diversity of interests affected by this rule, theDepartment made the 55-page summary prepared for internal use availableto the public free of charge (48 FR 56798, December 23, 1983). Approximately700 copies of the summary were requested and distributed to interestedpersons.The Department formed a Section 504 Task Force to consider the public commentsreceived in preparation of the final rule. This Task Force was composedof high level representatives of the major elements of the Department.A group of major disability organizations on two occasions requested meetingswith the Task Force. The first such meeting was held on August 25, 1983and the second on November 2, 1984. At these meetings the representativesof the disability groups represented provided oral comments on the proposedrule. The Department also received important and valuable written commentsfrom housing providers around the country. The issues raised by all ofthe comments received in response to the proposed rule received carefulconsideration in the preparation of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Public Comments</ITAG>4PreambleThe preamble of the proposed rule was discussed in 206 of the commentsreceived. Many of these commenters stated without explanation that thepreamble ``misuses civil rights case law.'' Only six commenters providedexplanations of their criticisms. This much smaller number of commentersunderstood the preamble to state that section 504 requires <T3>only </T3>that ``modest affirmative steps'' be taken to prevent discriminationagainst disabled persons. However, the preamble in fact states that courtdecisions ``have confirmed that section 504 requires <T3>at least </T3>``modest affirmative steps to accommodate handicappedpersons.'' 48 FR 22477 (emphasis supplied).<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG>Section 8.1Four commenters expressed concern over the sentence in andSection;8.1(a)of the proposed rule which stated that compliance with 24 CFR Part 8 ``doesnot assure compliance with requirements for accessibility by the physicallyhandicapped imposed pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968,as amended, (41 U.S.C. 4151 <T3>et seq.</T3>) where applicable.'' These commenters expressed some confusionas to the relationship between HUD's Architectural Barriers Act rule (24CFR Part 40) and HUD's section 504 rule. These comments are discussed alongwith other similar comments received on andSection;8.30 of the proposed rulewhich proposed standards for facility accessibility or dwelling unit accessibilitywhen applicable.HUD has amended andSection;8.1 to add that the rule also implements section109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42U.S.C. 5309). Section 109 prohibits discrimination in the Community DevelopmentBlock Grant (CDBG) Program. Section 109 provides that any prohibition ofdiscrimination with respect to other qualified individuals with handicapsas provided in section 504 shall also apply to the CDBG program.Section 8.2Section 8.2 of the proposed rule, which described the applicability ofthe rule, has been substantially rewritten from the wording of the proposedrule. However, the language was changed only to make the section easierto understand; the revised language does not alter the scope of the rule.Section 8.3A total of 985 comments were received on andSection;8.3, the definitionssection of the proposed rule.Three different definitions of the term ``accessible'' were proposed. Thefirst definition of the term accessible in the proposed rule stated that``accessible'', when used with respect to a program or activity, meansthat such program or activity is conducted, delivered, or offered in sucha way that qualified handicapped persons can benefit from and participatein the program or activity. The Department is deleting this definitionfrom the final rule because it is vague and unnecessary in view of andSection;8.20of the rule which sets forth the general requirement concerning programaccessibility.The second definition of ``accessible'' which appeared in the proposedrule has been revised to state that the term, when used with respect tothe design, construction or alteration of a facility or a portion of afacility, other than an individual dwelling unit, means that such facilityor portion thereof, when designed, constructed or altered, can be approached,entered and used by individuals with handicaps. A facility that complieswith the standards prescribed by andSection;8.32 of the final rule, the UniformFederal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), satisfies this definition of theterm accessible. The revision of this definition of ``accessible'' meansthat under the final rule UFAS is not the <T3>sole </T3>means by which recipients can achieve compliance with therequirement that new construction and alterations be accessible.The third definition of the term ``accessible'' relates to the design,construction, or alteration of individual dwelling units. The first sentenceof this definition has been revised from the proposed rule to make it consistentwith the concept of adaptability and to clarify the definition. The firstsentence of the definition now provides that ``accessible'', when usedwith respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individualdwelling unit, means that such unit is located on an accessible route andwhen designed, constructed, altered, or adapted, can be approached, entered,and used by individuals with physical handicaps. Again, UFAS is not the<T3>sole </T3>means of achieving accessibility. Furthermore, the definitionin the final rule, as did the definition in the proposed rule, makes itclear that an adaptable unit on an accessible route is an ``accessible''unit for purposes of this rule.The term ``adaptable'' in the proposed rule has been changed to ``adaptability''in the final rule and minor editorial changes have been made to clarifythe definition.The definition of the term ``applicant for assistance'' has been revisedfor clarity. The revised definition provides that an ``applicant for assistance''is one who submits an application, request, plan or statement requiredto be approved by a Department official or by a primary recipient as acondition to becoming eligible for Federal financial assistance. An applicationmeans such a request, plan or statement.A definition of the term ``auxiliary aids'' has been added to the finalrule in light of the addition of andSection;8.6, dealing with communications.Section 8.6 is discussed in more detail below.The definition of ``Federal financial assistance'' has been clarified.The revised definition also explicitly states that the term ``Federal financialassistance'' includes proceeds from guaranteed loans in the Community DevelopmentBlock Grant program. <T3>See </T3>24 CFR 570.602 (a) and (c).The final rule contains definitions of the terms ``historic preservationprograms or activities'' and ``historic properties.'' The term ``historicproperties'' is used in andSection; 8.31 of the final rule. The definitionappeared in andSection; 8.29 of the proposed rule. It has not been changedsubstantively. The term ``historic preservation programs or activities''is used in andSection; 8.21(c) of the final rule. An historic preservationprogram or activity is a HUD-assisted program having preservation of historicproperties as a primary purpose.Section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 changed thestatutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individual with handicaps.''Accordingly, the final rule refers to ``individual with handicaps'' and``qualified individual with handicaps,'' instead of ``handicapped person''and ``qualified handicapped persons,'' respectively. The definition of``individual with handicaps'' is identical to the definition of handicappedperson appearing in the section 504 coordination regulation for federallyassisted programs (28 CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the RehabilitationAct Amendments of 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual''to ``individual with handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendmentindicates that no substantive change was intended. In particular, althoughthe term ``individual with handicaps'' as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.Thus, although the term has been changed in this regulation to be consistentwith the statute as amended, the definition is unchanged, except for theaddition of language relating to alcoholics or drug abusers which was partof the definition of ``qualified handicapped persons'' in the proposedrule and one other change made as a result of the enactment in 1988 ofthe Civil Rights Restoration Act. These two changes are discussed below.The definition of ``qualified individuals with handicaps'' (``qualifiedhandicapped persons'' in the proposed rule) has been revised in a numberof respects from the definition the Department proposed in 1983. The proposedrule contained one definition with respect to employment and another definitionwith respect to programs or activities other than employment. While thedistinction between employment and non-employment programs has been retainedin the final rule, the Department has added a definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' with respect to any program or activity underwhich a person is required to perform services or to achieve a level ofaccomplishment. This addition is an adaptation of the definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' in the Department of Justice revised prototypefor Federally conducted programs (andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.103). In a program or activity under which a person is requiredto perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment a ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' is defined as an individual with handicapswho meets the essential eligibility requirements and who can achieve thepurpose of the program or activity without modifications in the programor activity that the recipient can demonstrate would result in a fundamentalalteration in its nature.In the proposed rule, the definition of ``qualified handicapped persons''with respect to employment stated that the term does not include any individualwho is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugsprevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in questionor whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, wouldconstitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others. This languageis derived from a 1978 amendment to the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. 706(7)(B),as amended by section 122(a) of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services,and Developmental Disabilities Amendment of 1978. In the final rule, thislanguage has been deleted from the definition of ``qualified individualwith handicaps'' and added to the definition of ``individual with handicaps''to more closely follow the statutory language.The portion of the definition of ``qualified handicapped persons'' withrespect to programs or activities in andSection; 8.3 of the proposed rulewas criticized because of the phrase excluding from that definition ``anyindividual whose current use of alcohol or drugs would constitute a directthreat to the property or safety of others.'' A number of commenters believethat this phrase should be deleted because the Rehabilitation Act onlymakes an express distinction relating to drug and alcohol use for purposesof employment. Although this statutory language does not apply expresslyin contexts other than employment, it is clear that individuals whose participation,by reason of current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threatto the property or safety of others are not ``individuals with handicaps''for purposes of section 504. Therefore, this language has, with some clarification,been retained in the final rule. However, as previously explained, it hasbeen moved to the definition of ``individual with handicaps.''The Department also wishes to stress that the fact that drug addictionand alcoholism may be handicaps does not mean that these conditions mustbe ignored by recipients in determining whether an individual is qualifiedfor services or employment opportunities. On the contrary, a recipientmay hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performanceand behavior to which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performanceor behavior is related to the person's drug addiction or alcoholism. Inother words, while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied servicesor disqualified from employment solely because of his or her condition,the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken into accountin determining whether he or she is qualified. For example, a person'sparticipation in an alcoholics anonymous group does not, in and of itself,disqualify the person from the definition of ``individual with handicaps.''With respect to the employment of a drug addict or alcoholic, if the addictionor alcoholism prevents successful performance of the job, the person neednot be provided the employment opportunity in question. For example, inmaking employment decisions, a recipient may judge addicts and alcoholicson the same basis it judges all other applicants and employees. Thus, arecipient may consider for all applicants, including drug addicts and alcoholics_pastpersonnel records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior,violations of rules and unsatisfactory work performance. Moreover, employersmay enforce rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugsin the work place, provided that such rules are enforced against all employees.With respect to other services, the implications of coverage of alcoholicsand drug addicts are two-fold: First, no person with handicaps, whetheror not related to drug addiction or alcoholism, may be excluded from servicessolely by reason of the presence or history of these conditions; second,to the extent that the manifestations of the condition prevent the personfrom meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the program or causeinterference with the operation of the program, the condition may be takeninto consideration. Thus, an owner may not exclude an addict or alcoholicas a tenant on the basis of addiction or alcoholism if the recipient determinesthat the person can successfully participate in the housing program andcomplies with the rules of the program and if his or her behavior doesnot constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.There was strong reaction to the portion of the definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped persons'' (now ``qualified individuals with handicaps'') thatproposed to define the term ``essential eligibility requirements.'' Mostcommenters criticized the phrase in the proposed rule indicating that handicappedpersons must comply ``with all obligations of occupancy, including theobligation to conduct himself or herself in a manner which will not disturbhis or her neighbors' peaceful enjoyment of their accommodation * * * .''The basic criticism of this language was that it would impose a ``doublestandard'' because non-handicapped persons are not required to prove thattheir behavior will not disturb neighbors.The quoted language was not intended to impose a ``double standard.'' Allapplicants for and tenants of HUD-assisted housing have an obligation notto disturb their neighbors' peaceful enjoyment of their accommodations.For example, and as some commenters recognized, the model lease for manyHUD programs requires that tenants agree not to ``make or permit noisesor acts that will disturb the rights or comfort of neighbors.'' In addition,HUD's tenant selection criteria for public housing require that PublicHousing Agencies (PHAs) establish criteria ``reasonably related to whetherthe conduct of the applicant in present or prior housing has been suchas would not be likely to interfere with other tenants <T3>in such a manner as to diminish their enjoyment of the premises * ** .</T3>'' 24 CFR 960.205(b) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the ``peacefulenjoyment'' language included in the definition of ``essential eligibilityrequirements'' for programs or activities other than employment does notimpose a requirement on handicapped housing applicants that is not imposedon non-handicapped housing applicants. Rather, it is merely an illustrationand application of the requirement that in order to be considered a ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' an individual must meet the ``essential eligibilityrequirements'' of the program. In this regard, a number of commenters supportedthe ``peaceful enjoyment'' language as consistent with the professionalmanagement of housing.Nonetheless, the large number of comments critical of the quoted languageindicates that the language could be misinterpreted and misapplied by recipients.Consequently, the Department is deleting the ``peaceful enjoyment'' languagein the final rule. The deletion of this language does not, however, alterthe requirement that in order for a handicapped person to be a ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' he or she must meet all of the stated and inherentessential eligibility requirements of the program in question.There was also criticism of the portion of the definition of ``essentialeligibility requirements'' which requires that an occupant of multifamilyhousing be capable of independent living. Some commenters feel that thelanguage should be omitted altogether because disabled persons can determinefor themselves whether or not they can live independently. Other commenterssuggested that the rule should provide standards, criteria and proceduresfor evaluating whether or not an applicant is capable of independent living.Still other commenters supported the definition as proposed.After carefully considering the comments received regarding the phrase``capable of independent living'' in andSection; 8.3 of the proposed rulethe Department has determined to delete the phrase from the definition.Instead, the definition as revised focuses upon an occupant of multifamilyhousing being capable of complying with all obligations of occupancy eitherwithout supportive services or with supportive services provided by persons<T3>other than </T3>the recipient. Such a person is qualified for housing.In a housing program, an individual with handicaps is ``qualified'' ifthe person meets the basic eligibility requirements that govern eligibilityfor admission, care, or service normally provided to others. For example,in a section 202 project a person is ineligible for housing for elderlypersons if the person does not meet the age requirement for admission tothe program. On the other hand, an individual with handicaps is ``qualified,''for example, for public housing, if the person meets current eligibilityrequirements such as income as well as implicit requirements inherent inthe nature of the program, such as that an occupant be capable of complyingwith all obligations of occupancy. Accordingly, persons with handicapscan be denied program benefits, such as occupancy of a dwelling unit ina HUD-assisted housing project, on the basis of failure to meet legitimateeligibility criteria that are applied to individuals both with and withouthandicaps. For example, an individual with handicaps can be denied occupancyon the basis of a record of disturbance of neighbors, or destruction ofproperty that may adversely affect other residents, or failure to meetrent obligations, even if the behavior is related to the person's handicap.HUD recipients will have to make decisions as to whether each applicantis qualified on a case-by-case basis in the course of their ordinary eligibilitydeterminations. In making these determinations, a presumption in favorof the individual's own assessment of his or her capabilities is warrantedin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.At the same time, a recipient is not required to provide supportive services,<T3>e.g., </T3>counseling, medical, or social services that fall outsidethe scope of its housing program. A recipient is required to make modificationsin order to enable a qualified applicant with handicaps to participate,but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentally different nature.<T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979).The test is whether, with appropriate modifications, the applicant canachieve the purpose of the program offered; not whether the applicant couldbenefit or obtain results from some other program that the recipient doesnot offer. For example, in a housing program a recipient is not requiredto provide supportive services to enable an individual with handicaps toparticipate in the program unless the purpose of the program is, at leastin part, to provide supportive services. See andSection; 8.24(b). In a programin which supportive services are not contemplated, providing them wouldresult in a fundamental alteration in the program_<T3>e.g., </T3>to an intermediate care program. In this example, if theindividual does not require supportive services from the recipient, theindividual would be qualified, provided that he or she meets the essentialeligibility requirements for the program. Of course, all services (e.g.,routine medical check-ups or social services) that are provided as partof the program must be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis. The rulealso provides that recipients need not take any action that would resultin undue financial and administrative burdens.It should be noted that some projects are designed specifically for personswho are <T3>not </T3>capable of living completely ``independently'', <T3>see, e.g., </T3>24 CFR 882.102 (definition of ``Independent Group Residence'').However, most HUD-assisted housing projects do not offer support services.In a project that does not provide support services it is not legally significantwhether the obligations of tenancy are met by the individual alone or withassistance which he or she arranges. However, the Department wishes tostress that a recipient is not required to provide support services tomeet the needs of an individual with handicaps if these services are notpart of the original program. Such action would constitute a fundamentalalteration in the nature of the program, which is not required by section504. <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979).A number of other definitions have been added to andSection; 8.3 of the rule.A definition of the term ``program or activity'' has been added to therule as a result of the enactment of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of1987 (Pub. L. 100-259). Section 4 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act amendedsection 504 to add a definition of the term ``program or activity'' asthat term is used in section 504. The definition of the term ``programor activity'' in the final rule restates the definition in the Civil RightsRestoration Act.Section 9 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act amended section 7(8) of theRahabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 708(8), to add a new subparagraph(C) which states that for purposes of section 504, as it relates to employment,the term individual with handicaps ``does not include an individual whohas a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of suchdisease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health orsafety of other individuals or who, by reason of the currently contagiousdisease or infection, is unable to perform the duties of the job.'' Thislanguage has been added to the definition of ``individual with handicaps''in the rule in order to conform the rule to the statute, as amended byCongress.The Civil Rights Restoration Act also amended section 504 to add a provisionrelating to ``small providers.'' It states that ``small providers'' arenot required by section 504 to make significant structural alterationsto their existing facilities for the purpose of assuring program accessibility,if alternative means of providing the services are available. The CivilRights Restoration Act further provides that the terms used in the subsectionrelating to small providers ``shall be construed with reference to theregulations existing on the date of the enactment of this subsection.''The Civil Rights Restoration Act does not contain a definition of the term``small provider.'' The Department is considering publishing a proposedrule which would amend Part 8 to add a definition of ``small provider''and otherwise implement the provision of the Civil Rights Restoration Actrelating to small providers.A definition of the term ``primary recipient'' has been added to the finalrule. A ``primary recipient'' is defined to mean any person, group, organization,State or local unit of government that is authorized or required to extendFederal financial assistance to another recipient for the purpose of carryingout a program.The final rule defines the term ``replacement cost of the completed facility.''The term, which is used in andSection; 8.23(a) of the final rule, is definedas the current cost of construction and equipment for a newly constructedhousing facility of the size and type being altered. Construction and equipmentcosts do not include the cost of land, demolition, site improvements, non-dwellingfacilities and administrative costs for project development activities.This definition, which did not appear in the proposed rule, has been addedso the meaning of the term ``replacement cost of the completed facility''will be clear. The definition in the final rule is based upon the definitionof the term ``prototype costs'' as the term is used in the public housingprogram. <T3>See </T3>24 CFR 941.204.A definition of the term ``substantial impairment'' has also been addedto andSection; 8.3 as it relates to historic facilities. Substantial impairmentis defined to mean a significant loss of the integrity of finished materials,design quality or special character resulting from a permanent alteration.The term is used in andSection; 8.31 of the final rule which relates to historicfacilities.Section 8.4A large number of commenters opposed the deletion in andSection; 8.4(a) ofthe proposed rule of the words ``or benefits from'' from the phrase ``anyprogram or activity that receives <T3>or benefits from </T3>Federal financial assistance'' that appears inthe DOJ Coordination Regulation. 28 CFR 41.51(a) (emphasis supplied). Inthe preamble to the proposed rule (48 FR 22474) the Department explainedthat the deletion of the phrase ``or benefits from'' was made to conformthe regulatory language to that of the statute and was not intended toalter the jurisdictional reach of section 504. The Department further statedin the preamble of the proposed rule that while the phrase ``or benefitsfrom'' may be critical in the context of certain other government programsit is not aware of a context involving HUD programs where the phrase wouldmake a difference. The Department invited comments as to specific contextsin which an issue as to the jurisdictional reach may be seen as arisingbased upon this language.The Department received only a few examples in response to its request.The examples received express concern that deletion of the ``or benefitsfrom'' language would mean that only direct recipients of HUD assistancewould be covered by section 504. However, the commenters seem to be confusingtwo situations: Those in which programs <T3>indirectly receive </T3>actual Federal financial assistance, and thosein which entities merely ``benefit from,'' but do not receive, the assistance.The first are covered by section 504; the second are not. The definitionof ``recipient'' in andSection; 8.3 expressly includes any instrumentalityof a State or its political subdivision, any private agency, institution,organization, or other entity, or any person to which Federal financialassistance is extended directly or <T3>through another recipient</T3> * * *.'' Thus, the rule expressly coverssubrecipients.The Department also received a large number of comments stating that theDepartment should not have omitted from andSection; 8.4(b)(4) of the proposedrule language in the Department of Justice Coordination Regulation statingthat recipients may not utilize criteria or methods of administration that``have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discriminationon the basis of handicap.'' 28 CFR 41.51(b)(3). These commenters pointedout that this language is important because intentional discriminationis often difficult to prove. Furthermore, the Supreme Court recently assumed,without actually deciding, that section 504 ``reaches at least some conductthat has an unjustifiable disparate impact upon the handicapped.'' <T3>Alexander v. Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287, 289 (1985). The Court, in itsanalysis, reviewed the legislative history of section 504 and concludedthat ``[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congressto be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessnessand indifference_of benign neglect.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 295 (footnote omitted). For these reasons, the Departmenthas added language to andSection; 8.4(b)(4) of the final rule making it clearthat a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements,utilize criteria or methods of administration that have the purpose orthe effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discriminationon the basis of handicap. In addition, the Department has added languageto andSection; 8.4(b)(5) making it clear that applicants for assistance andrecipients may not, in determining the site or location of a facility,make selections the purpose or effect of which would exclude handicappedpersons from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discriminationunder any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.Section 8.4(b)(4) prohibits the use of criteria or methods of administrationthat have the effect of discriminating against individuals of a particularhandicap. However, not all instances of disparate impact signal the existenceof illegal discrimination. If a neutral policy that causes a desparateeffect is manifestly related to the accomplishment of a program objective,it does not violate this provision.  Section 8.4(b)(5) prohibits discriminatory site selection. Paragraph (b)(6)of the proposed rule would have allowed HUD to exempt a recipient fromthe requirement of paragraph (b)(5) if compliance would have rendered thefacility ``financially infeasible'' or if the alternative to compliancewould be ``nonparticipation'' in the program. The Department has deletedthe exemption in andSection;8.4(b)(6) of the proposed rule because it isunnecessary. The final rule makes it clear that the rule's program accessibilityrequirements never require a recipient to take any action that would resultin a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or in undue financialand administrative burdens. Furthermore, the Department of Justice hasconsistently interpreted provisions similar to andSection;8.4(b)(5) as <T3>not </T3>prohibiting a recipient that has facilities located on hillyterrain, for instance, from erecting any new facilities at its presentsite. Furthermore, the deletion of paragraph (b)(6) makes HUD's final ruleconsistent with the Department of Justice Coordination Regulation. <T3>See </T3>28 CFR 41.51(b)(4).  HUD has also added to andSection;8.4 a new paragraph (b)(6) prohibiting discriminationin facilities constructed with Federal funds. Finally, HUD has added toandSection;8.4(b)(1) a new subparagraph (andSection;8.4(b)(1)(vii)) which prohibitsa recipient from denying a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer orrenter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter or a person residingin or intending and eligible to reside in that dwelling after it is sold,rented or made available. This provision makes it clear that a recipientmay not refuse to rent or sell to an otherwise qualified individual becausethat individual resides, or intends to reside, with a person who is handicapped. Section 8.4(c)(1) of the proposed and final rules provides that the exclusionof non-handicapped persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federalstatute or executive order to individuals with handicaps or the exclusionof a specific class of individuals with handicaps from a program limitedby Federal statute or Executive Order to a different class of individualswith handicaps is not prohibited by this rule. An example of such a Federalprogram is found in section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, 12 U.S.C. 1701(``section 202''). The section 202 program provides Federal financial assistanceto private sponsors who provide housing for the elderly and/or handicapped.There are three distinct categories of eligible handicapped persons inthe section 202 program: Those who are physically handicapped; developmentallydisabled; and chronically mentally ill. Thus, including elderly persons(age 62 or over) there are actually four separate groups of persons eligiblefrom section 202 assistance, and each group has distinct needs. Accordingly,section 202 developments are custom tailored to the specific client populationor populations the sponsor was approved by HUD to serve. For instance,many section 202 projects are lawfully limited to elderly and physicallyhandicapped persons. It follows that developmentally disabled and chronicallymentally ill persons who are not also elderly or physically handicapped,are not ``otherwise qualified individuals with handicaps'' for projectsdesigned and approved for elderly and physically handicapped persons andcannot be admitted to them. As andSection;8.4(c)(1) makes clear, such a denialdoes not violate section 504. HUD's policy with regard to section 202 projectshas been upheld in the courts. For example, in <T3>Brecker v. Queens B'nai B'rith, </T3>607 F. Supp. 428 (E.D.N.Y. 1985),<T3>aff'd, </T3>798 F.2d 52, 57 (2d Cir. 1986), the court stated that ``[s]ection504 may not be used to expand the delivery of benefits awarded under anotherstatute if that statute otherwise restricts the delivery of benefits.''<T3>Id. </T3>at 436 (citations omitted). <T3>See also Knutzen v. Eben Ezer Lutheran Housing Center, </T3>815 F.2d1343 (10th Cir. 1987); and <T3>Edge v. Pierce, </T3>No. 82-51, slip op. (D.N.J. May 22, 1984).  Two new paragraphs have been added to andSection;8.4. Section 8.4(e) dealswith the relationship between this rule and inconsistent State or locallaws. Paragraph (e) makes it clear that the obligation to comply with thisrule is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or locallaw or other requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes inconsistentor contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualifiedindividuals with handicaps to receive services or to practice any occupationor profession.  Paragraph (f) makes it clear that the enumeration of specific forms ofprohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) through (e) of andSection;8.4does not limit the general prohibition on discrimination in paragraph (a).Section 8.4(e) of the proposed rule contained a requirement that recipients``take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their applicants,employees, and beneficiaries are available to persons with impaired hearing.''The final rule substitutes for andSection; 8.4(e) a separate, more comprehensiveand detailed section on communications (andSection; 8.6). Section 8.6 isadapted from the Department of Justice's regulation for federally conductedprograms. Section 8.6 of the final rule explicitly requires the provisionof auxiliary aids where necessary to ensure that qualified individualswith handicaps are provided opportunities to benefit from housing and nonhousingprograms that are as effective as that provided to individuals withouthandicaps. Auxiliary aids are often critically needed in these programs.For example, to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants,and members of the public who are hearing- or speech-impaired, a recipientmay be required to install in its office a telecommunication device toallow an individual with impaired hearing or speech to call directly tothe recipient's office without the need for an interpreter. To providepersons with impaired vision with information as to the existence and locationconcerning its programs or activities, and facilities, a recipient maybe required to tape record, print written material in large print or transcribein Braille certain information concerning its programs or activities. Arecipient may be required to provide devices such as auxiliary alarms forpersons with hearing or vision impairments or a decoding device to equipa television in a public area to provide closed-captioning service, sothat participants with hearing impairments receive benefits that are aseffective as those provided to participants without handicaps. However,a recipient need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers forpersonal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature. For example,a recipient need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicantsor participants in its programs or activities. Similarly, the rule doesnot require a recipient to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobilityimpairments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Employment</ITAG>Section 8.11Fifteen (15) comments discussed andSection; 8.11, which requires that recipientsmake reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitationsof qualified handicapped applicants and employees. Five of these commenterssuggested that andSection; 8.11(b) be amended to require that an employerplace handicapped persons in the job best suited to their individual handicaps.On the other hand, one commenter feels that section 504 does not requireany job restructuring, even in the form of shifting non-essential dutiesto other employees. Section 8.11 strikes a balance in between these twopositions. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.11 makes clear that reasonableaccommodation is intended to include, but is not limited to, the modificationof work schedules, including part-time employment, and job restructuring.Job restructuring may entail shifting non-essential duties to other employees.However, this does not mean that an employer is required to place a handicappedperson in any one particular position. Rather, andSection; 8.11 requiresonly that an employer make reasonable accommodation where necessary tohelp handicapped persons overcome difficulties they may have in performingthe essential elements of a particular position. In addition, two commenterspraised the examples of reasonable accommodation in andSection; 8.11(b).Section 8.13Six comments were received on andSection; 8.13 dealing with preemploymentinquiries, two of which were of a detailed nature. One commenter expressedconcern that the limitations on requiring a medical examination in andSection;8.13(c) would create problems for some large employers. Paragraph (c) proposedto allow an employer to condition an offer of employment on the resultsof a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance onduty if two conditions are met. The commenter explained that it is notuncommon for multi-location corporations operating a central employmentoffice to maintain large applicant pools, in some instances numbering ashigh as 300 applicants. These applicant pools enable employers to respondquickly to request for large numbers of employees needed for particularprojects and the success of these pools depends upon an ability to matchexpeditiously applicant skills and qualifications with job requirements.The ability to respond quickly, it is argued, is lost if medical examinationscan be given only after an applicant has already been conditionally hiredand referred. On the other hand, another commenter feels that andSection;8.13 does not go far enough. This commenter specifically objected to allowinga mandatory medical examination unless <T3>all </T3>employees, and not just those in a particular job category,are required to take the examination. On balance the Department believesthat andSection; 8.13 should remain unchanged from the proposed rule. Whilethe first commenter's concern is legitimate, allowing medical examinationbefore an offer of employment (conditional or unconditional) is actuallymade creates a significant potential for discrimination against handicappedapplicants. Furthermore, such discrimination would often be difficult toprove. The Department also believes that adoption of the second commenter'srecommendation that the Department delete the phrase ``in that categoryof job classification'' from andSection; 8.13(c)(1) would impose an unnecessaryburden and expense on employers. For example, an employer may require medicalexaminations for positions involving physical labor but not for other typesof positions. Such distinctions are reasonable and non-discriminatory.The Department see no reason to place section 504 recipients in the positionof having to choose between requiring medical examinations in their federallyassisted programs for all job classifications or foregoing medical examinationsaltogether. Of course, a recipient may only use the results of the medicalexamination in accordance with the requirements of this part. The resultsof a medical examination may not be used to deny employment to a handicappedperson who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the job unless therecipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an unduehardship on the operation of its program.Section 8.14Because of several Federal Circuit court decisions, andSection; 8.14 of theproposed rule provided that subpart B would not be enforced in certainstates unless the primary objective of the Federal financial assistancewas to provide employment. After the publication of the proposed rule theSupreme Court ruled that section 504 prohibits employment discriminationeven if the recipient of Federal financial assistance receives no aid theprimary purpose of which is to promote employment. <T3>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, </T3>104 S.Ct. 1248 (1984). Accordingly,andSection; 814 of the proposed rule has been deleted in the final rule;subpart B will be enforced nationwide with respect to all HUD-assistedprograms and activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Program Accessibility</ITAG>Section 8.20Section 8.20 proposed a general requirement concerning program accessibility.It provided that each program or activity that receives Federal financialassistance from HUD shall be operated so that the program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by qualifiedindividuals with handicaps. For the sake of consistency, HUD has revisedandSection; 8.20 to follow the general statement concerning program accessibilityappearing in the Department of Justice Coordination Regulation. <T3>See </T3>28 CFR 41.56. Accordingly, andSection; 8.20 has been revisedto provide that, except as otherwise provided in andSection;andSection; 8.21(c)(1),8.24(a), 8.25, and 8.31, no qualified individual with handicaps shall,because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individualswith handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participationin, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activitythat receives Federal financial assistance. Section 8.21Section 8.21 proposed a program accessibility requirement with regard tonon-housing facilities. The section as proposed did not deal separatelywith new construction, alterations and existing non-housing facilities.For the sake of clarity, the final rule does so. Section 8.21(a) of thefinal rule provides that newly constructed non-housing facilities shallbe readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. A non-housingfacility designed and constructed in accordance with UFAS satisfies thisrequirement. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.21 provides that alterations to existing non-housingfacilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be readilyaccessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. A recipient isnot required by paragraph (b) to make a non-housing facility accessibleif doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens onthe operation of the recipient's program or activity. Paragraph (c) of andSection; 8.21 relates to existing non-housing facilitiesnot being altered and requires that recipients operate non-housing programsor activities receiving HUD assistance so that the program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. Paragraph (c) of the final rule also provides, as did paragraph(b) of the proposed rule, that a recipient is not necessarily requiredto make each of its existing non-housing facilities readily accessibleto and usable by individuals with handicaps. Paragraph (c) of the finalrule also states that a recipient is not required to take any action thatit can demonstrate would result in a ``fundamental alteration'' in thenature of its program or activity or in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens.'' Most of the 88 comments the Department received on andSection; 8.21 relatedto the ``fundamental alteration'' and ``undue financial or administrativeburden'' language in the proposed rule. One group of commenters objectedto this language on the ground that a civil right should not be thwartedby the excuse of administrative burden. Other commenters fear that thelanguage is too broad and susceptible of loose interpretation. The ``fundamentalalteration'' and ``undue financial or administrative burden'' languagein the proposed rule was based upon the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979),holding that section 504 does not require program modifications that resultin a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program, and in the Court'sstatement that section 504 does not require modifications that would resultin ``undue financial and administrative burdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Thus,section 504 does not create an absolute right to access. <T3>See also, Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee v. Rhode IslandPublic Transit Authority, </T3>718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir. 1983). <T3>Davis </T3>has been followed in the circuit courts. <T3>Dopico v. Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2nd Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association v. Lewis </T3>(APTA), 655 F.2d1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). In addition, the Department of Justice, the agencyresponsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of section504 throughout the Federal government, has, with one minor exception, adoptedthis very same standard in its section 504 regulation governing the Departmentof Justice's Federally conducted programs, 28 CFR 39.150 (Program accessibility:Existing facilities), and in its prototype rule for other agencies' programs,andSection; <T2>XX</T2>.150. The Department of Justice regulation refers to ``unduefinancial <T3>and </T3>administrative burdens'' instead of the ``undue financial<T3>or </T3>administrative burdens'' language used in HUD's proposed rule.In order to conform the Department's regulation to <T3>Davis </T3>and the Department of Justice section 504 regulation governingfederally conducted programs the final HUD rule refers to ``undue financial<T3>and </T3>administrative burdens.'' Moreover, since the ``fundamentalalteration'' and ``undue financial and administrative burdens'' limitationscodify recent case law the Department does not see any legal basis foromitting them from the rule as suggested by some commenters. The Departmentnotes that, since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied the ``undue financial and administrativeburdens'' limitation on a showing that only one of the two ``undue burdents''would be created as a result of the modification sought to be imposed undersection 504. <T3>See e.g., Dopico v. Goldschmidt, supra; APTA, supra. </T3>However,the Department wishes to stress that the limitations in paragraph (c) arenot intended, as some commenters suggested, to render meaningless the accessibilityrequirements of andSection; 8.21, and they cannot be fairly read as doingso. Paragraph (c)(3) of andSection; 8.21 follows the Department of Justice CoordinationRegulation in setting a time period for compliance. The final rule providesthat the recipient shall comply with the requirements of andSection; 8.21within sixty days of July 11, 1988, except where structural changes infacilities are undertaken. If structural changes are undertaken, they mustbe made within three years of July 11, 1988, and a transition plan mustalso be prepared. Section 8.22 The Department received 338 comments on andSection; 8.22 which proposed accessibilityrequirements for newly constructed housing. The proposed rule providedthat a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units in a projectcontaining not less than 15 dwelling units (but not less than one unitin any such project) be made accessible for persons with mobility impairmentsand an additional two percent be made accessible for persons with hearingand vision impairments. After carefully considering the comments receivedon the proposed rule the Department has determined, for the reasons setforth below, not to change the five percent accessibility requirement.The Department has also retained the requirement that an additional twopercent of the units (but not less than one unit) in a covered projectbe accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments. A unit whichis accessible for persons with hearing impairments must have an auxiliary(<T3>i.e., </T3>visual) emergency alarm. The Department has, however, deletedthe requirement in the proposed rule that a project have 15 or more unitsbefore the five percent requirement takes effect. The Department believesthat the five percent (or at least one unit) minimum should apply to allHUD-assisted multifamily housing projects.A multifamily housing project is defined as a project with five or moredwelling units. This definition is consistent with the definition of multifamilyhousing project in section 207(c) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C.1713. A project is defined as the whole of one or more residential structuresand appurtenant structures, equipment, roads, walks, and parking lots whichare covered by a single contract for Federal financial assistance or applicationfor assistance, or are treated as a whole for processing purposes, whetheror not located on a common site. Thus, a multifamily housing project includes,for example, three separate two-family structures (i.e., six dwelling units)which are covered by a single contract for Federal financial assistance,or application for assistance, or are treated as a whole for processingpurposes, whether or not the structures are located on a common site.The five percent requirement has been accepted by the Architectural andTransportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) as well as the four standardsetting agencies (the General Services Administration, the Departmentsof Housing and Urban Development and Defense, and the United States PostalService) as satisfying the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Actof 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157. The Architectural Barriers Act requires certainFederal and Federally funded buildings to be constructed or altered inaccordance with accessibility standards. The applicable accessibility standards,called the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), were issuedon August 7, 1984 by the four agencies responsible for setting standardsunder the Architectural Barriers Act, 49 FR 31528. Specifically, the UFASrequires that five percent of the units (or at least one unit, whicheveris greater) be accessible in newly constructed Federally-assisted projectsof 15 or more dwelling units. A different percentage may be set by theappropriate Federal agency following a local needs assessment conductedby local governmnent bodies or states under applicable regulations. UFASandpara;4.1.4(11)(b). (As explained in the preceding paragraph, this finalrule applies accessibility requirements to projects of five or more units;and the rule allows a higher, but not a lower percentage to be set by HUDas explained below. The Department of Justice requested these two changes.This approach has been followed in andSection; 8.32(d) as well.) The fivepercent requirement was accepted by the ATBCB and the four standard settingagencies based upon a reading of the legislative history of the ArchitecturalBarriers Act which finds Congressional intent clear that 100 percent accessibilityof dwelling units was not contemplated. In the absence of discussion ofthis issue in the legislative history of section 504, this stands as theCongressional intent with regard to accessibility in residential facilities.Furthermore, the Department of Justice, as the agency responsible underExecutive Order 12250 for coordinating enforcement of section 504, hasrecommended that agencies provide in their section 504 regulations forFederally assisted programs, that with respect to new construction andalterations, compliance with the UFAS shall be deemed compliance with section504. In addition, Departmental experience has shown the five percent requirementto be adequate.Section 8.22(b) of the proposed rule would have allowed a sponsor or developerof a multifamily project otherwise subject to andSection; 8.22(a) to requesta waiver of the five percent requirement upon demonstrating to the reasonablesatisfaction of HUD that the provision of additional accessibile unitswould exceed the need for such units in the housing market area. Paragraph(c) of andSection; 8.22 of the proposed rule would have allowed HUD to prescribea higher percentage or number than required by the five percent requirementin andSection; 8.22(b) of the final rule for any area upon request thereforby any State of local government or agency thereof based upon a local needsassessment. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.22 of the proposed rule has beendeleted. In view of the low cost of making units accessible in newly constructedmultifamily housing projects HUD sees no need ever to waive the five percentrequirement in the context of new construction. Even if there is no unmetneed at the time of construction, there may be a need for additional accessibleunits over the life of the project. It would be far more expensive to retrofitunits at a later date. In addition, an adaptable unit is, for purposesof this rule, equivalent to a fully accessible unit.Section 8.22(c) of the final rule continues to provide that HUD may prescribea higher percentage or number than that prescribed in andSection;8.22(b)of the final rule upon request therefor by any affected recipient or byany State or local government or agency thereof based upon demonstrationto the reasonable satisfaction of HUD or a need for a higher percentageor number based on census data or other available current data (includinga currently effective Housing Assistance Plan or Comprehensive HomelessAssistance Plan), or in response to evidence of a need for a higher percentageor number received in any other manner. In reviewing such a request, HUDwill take into account the expected needs of eligible persons with andwithout handicaps.Paragraph (c) of andSection; 8.22 of the proposed rule also provided that,except for group homes or independent living complexes for handicappedpersons, in no event shall more than 15 percent of the units in any projectbe required to be accessible to persons with mobility impairments. A numberof commenters objected to this limitation. The Department considered thisprovision important in order to avoid the segregation of the handicapped.This provision was designed to implement the principle in andSection; 8.4(a)that programs and activities be administered in the most integrated settingappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps. However,in view of the comments received, including comments from the Departmentof Justice, the Department reconsidered the need for a 15 percent ceilingand has deleted this provision from the final rule. The Department believesthat a reasonable distribution of accessible dwellings units can be achievedby recipients without imposing on them an absolute ceiling. Recipientsare nonetheless required to administer their programs in the most integratedsetting appropriate. In this regard, andSection; 8.26 requires that accessibledwelling units be distributed throughout projects and sites. The 15% ceilinghas also been deleted in andSection;andSection; 8.23 and 8.25 of the finalrule for the same reasons.Section 8.22 has also been revised so that the applicable accessibilitystandards (i.e., UFAS) are not the <T3>sole </T3>means of designing and constructing accessible units. Section8.22(a) allows any design to be used as long as the resulting facilityis ``readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.''Section 8.23Section 8.23 of the proposed rule proposed to apply the new constructionaccessibility standard to facilities containing 25 or more units if thecost of the alterations is 75 percent or more of the replacement cost ofthe completed facility. Section 8.23 also proposed a more limited accessibilityrequirement to apply where the 25 units/75 percent of replacement costthreshold is not met. In such cases the proposed rule provided that alterationsto common areas be accessible ``to the extent feasible.'' The Departmentalso proposed that alterations to dwelling units where the 25 units/75percent threshold is not met be made accessible, to the extent feasible,if, as a result of such alterations, the unit could be made accessiblefor persons of identifiable types or degrees of disability or impairment.Section 8.23 prompted 290 comments, many of which complained that the 25units/75 percent standard is so rigorous as to practically eliminate accessibilityrequirements when altering buildings and suggested that a 10 unit/50 percentstandard would be preferable. Many commenters also criticized the section'sreliance upon the ``replacement cost of the completed project'' ratherthan the fair market value of the completed facility, pointing out theirbelief that replacement cost is almost always higher than the market valueof the building. These comments appear to assume that if the 25 units/75percent threshold is not met, that there is no accessibility requirement,even though this is not what was proposed.The Department has carefully considered these comments and has made threechanges to andSection; 8.23. First, the Department has lowered the 25 unitthreshold to 15 units. Second, even though the Department has retainedthe 75 percent of replacement cost threshold, HUD has clarified and strengthenedthe accessibility requirement where the 15 units/75 percent threshold is<T3>not </T3>met. Specifically, andSection; 8.23(b)(1) of the final ruleprovides that, subject to andSection; 8.23(b)(2) (which is identical to andSection;8.22(c)), if the 15 units/75 percent threshold in paragraph (a) is <T3>not </T3>met, then, to the maximum extent feasible, alterations todwelling units in a multifamily housing project (including public housing)must be made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals withhandicaps. Beyond this, if alterations of single elements or spaces ofa dwelling unit, when considered together, amount to an alteration of theentire dwelling unit (<T3>e.g., </T3>alteration of bathroom, kitchen and entryways), then theentire dwelling unit must be made accessible. Once five percent of thedwelling units in a project are accessible, then no additional elementsor entire dwelling units need to be made accessible under this paragraph.However, if there is a demonstrated need, HUD may, under andSection; 8.23(b)(2),require that more than 5% of the units being altered be made accessible,to the maximum extent feasible. Alterations to common areas or parts offacilities that affect accessibility of existing housing facilities alsomust, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be accessible to and usableby individuals with handicaps. This provision is important because in orderfor a unit to be ``accessible'' it must be on an accessible route. Otherwise,a mobility impaired person will not be able to get into or out of the unit.The Department has also clarified the phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible''so it is clear that a recipient is never required to undertake to providea degree of accessibility which would impose undue financial and administrativeburdens on the operation of the multifamily housing project. At the sametime, the Department wishes to stress that when covered alterations areundertaken accessibility must be provided <T3>up to </T3>the point of infeasibility or undue financial and administrativeburdens.The Department does not consider it appropriate to lower the 75 percentof replacement cost threshold to 50 percent because the threshold triggersthe accessibility standard applicable to new construction and this standardshould apply only to the alteration of existing housing facilities whenthose alterations are extensive enough to be considered tantamount to newconstruction. The Department believes that when the cost of alterationsis 75 percent or more of the current replacement cost of the completedfacility, then the alterations are tantamount to new construction. A lowerthreshold might well require some recipients to incur extensive costs beyondwhat is required by section 504. The Supreme Court in <T3>Davis, supra, </T3>made it clear that section 504 does not place sucha burden on recipients. In any event, even where the 15 units/75 percentof replacement cost threshold is not met a recipient nonetheless must complywith andSection; 8.23(b).Twenty-one comments suggested that at least three percent of rehabilitatedhousing be set aside for persons with mental handicaps. The purpose ofandSection; 8.23 is to provide for physical access as required by section504. Persons with mental handicaps do not require special features in theirunits and therefore, have, if they are otherwise qualified, access to anyunit. As a result, the Department believes that a three percent set asidefor this particular type of handicap would be inappropriate.Section 8.23(b) of the proposed rule provided that the requirements ofandSection; 8.23 do not apply to an individual who borrows or receives fundsto rehabilitate a dwelling unit in which he or she resides or intends toreside. This paragraph has been deleted from the final rule because theDepartment, upon further reflection, considers it unnecessary. A personwho alters a unit for his or her own use is a beneficiary and not a recipientof Federal financial assistance and therefore is not subject to the requirementsof this part.Section 8.24 (Final Rule)Section 8.24 of the final rule sets forth program accessibility requirementswith regard to existing housing programs. Program accessibility in thepublic housing program (including multi-family Indian housing) is specificallycovered in andSection; 8.25. Additional program accessibility requirementsfor the section 8 existing housing certificate and housing voucher programsare set forth in andSection; 8.28 of the final rule. Section 8.24 appliesto the rental rehabilitation and the section 8 moderate rehabilitationprograms. An additional program accessibility requirement for the rentalrehabilitation program is in a new andSection; 8.30.Section 8.24 of the final rule is similar to andSection; 8.22 of the Department's1978 proposed rule. 43 FR 16658. Section 8.24 also closely follows 28 CFR41.57 which is part of the Department of Justice Coordination Regulation.Paragraph (a) of andSection; 8.24 provides that a recipient shall operateeach existing housing program or activity so, when viewed in its entirety,it is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. However,paragraph (a) also states that andSection; 8.24 does not necessary requirea recipient to make each of its existings facilities accessible to an usableby individuals with handicaps. Moreover, a recipient is not required totake any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. If a recipient has insufficient accessible dwelling units, itmay need to undertake structural changes within the time period in paragraph(c) in order to comply with andSection; 8.24. In addition, recipients havea continuing obligation to comply with andSection; 8.24. For example, ifan otherwise qualified individual with handicaps requiring an accessibleunit is next in line for a unit and the only unit available is not accessible,then the recipient must make the unit accessible unless it can demonstratethat doing so would result in undue financial and administrative burdens.Paragraph (b) provides that a recipient is not required to make structuralchanges in existing housing facilities where other methods are effectivein achieving compliance with andSection; 8.24. However, in choosing amongavailable methods for achieving program accessibility, recipients mustgive priority to those methods that offer housing to qualified individualswith handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate, i.e., in a settingthat enables qualified individuals with handicaps to interact with nonhandicappedpersons to the fullest extent possible.Paragraph (c) sets a time period for achieving compliance with andSection;8.24. Recipients must comply with the requirements of andSection; 8.24 withinsixty days of July 11, 1988, except where structural changes are undertaken.Except in the public housing program, if structural changes are undertakenthey must be made within three years of July 11, 1988. In a public housingprogram where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changesmust be made within the timeframes established in andSection; 8.25(c), whichis discussed below.If structural changes are to be undertaken to achieve program accessibility,a recipient (except as provided in andSection; 8.25(c)) is required by paragraph(d) to develop, within six months of July 11, 1988, a transition plan settingforth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan must be developedwith the assistance of interested persons, including individuals with handicapsor organizations representing individuals with handicaps.Proposed section 8.24 (Final Rule section 8.25)Section 8.25 of the final rule sets forth the program accessibility requirementsfor the public housing program, including multi-family Indian housing.Section 8.25 of the final rule corresponds to andSection; 8.24 of the proposedrule.Paragraph (a) of andSection; 8.24 of the proposed rule proposed that newlyconstructed public housing be required to comply with the standards applicableto residential structures, under 24 CFR 40.4 (i.e., UFAS). Paragraph (a)(1)of andSection; 8.25 of the final rule provides more generally that the requirementsof andSection; 8.22 shall apply to all newly constructed public housing.Consistent with other sections of the final rule, andSection; 8.32 of thefinal rule makes it clear that compliance with UFAS is not the <T3>sole </T3>means of achieving accessibility. Of course, public housingprograms must also comply with the Architectural Barriers Act and the requirementsof 24 CFR Part 40 in addition to the requirements of this part.Public housing is not only developed through new construction; it is alsodeveloped through the rehabilitation of existing housing and through thepurchase of existing properties. Existing public housing also is modernizedfrom time to time. Paragraph (a)(2) of andSection; 8.25 of the final ruleprovides that andSection; 8.23, relating to the alteration of existing housingfacilities, applies to public housing acquired through rehabilitation andto the alteration of public housing. In addition, alterations to publichousing projects are covered by the Architectural Barriers Act. <T3>See also, </T3>24 CFR Part 40.Paragraph (a)(3) of andSection; 8.25 provides that in developing public housingthrough the purchase of existing properties PHAs shall give priority tofacilities which are readily accessible to and usable by individuals withhandicaps.Most of the comments the Department received on andSection; 8.24 of the proposedrule objected to the provision in paragraph (c) (relating to the modernizationof public housing) that PHAs not be required to make more than five percentof the units covered by any modernization projects accessible. These commentersviewed this as a ``ceiling'' applying to the construction and alterationof all public housing and noted that the figure in the proposed rule forother HUD-assisted housing was 15 percent. However, paragraph (c) of proposedandSection; 8.24 dealt only with public housing covered by a modernizationprogram and did not propose to set a five-percent ceiling on the constructionand alteration of public housing. Furthermore, after careful considerationand consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department has eliminatedthe five-percent ceiling which it proposed in connection with modernizationprograms. This change is described in more detail below.Section 8.25(a)(1) of the final rule (as did andSection; 8.24(a) of the proposedrule) makes andSection; 8.22 applicable to all newly constructed public housing.Section 8.22 of the final rule in turn allows up to 100 percent of theunits (provided there is evidence of a need greater than five percent)in any project to be made accessible to persons with mobility impairments.Section 8.23 of the final rule applies to public housing units which arebeing altered (including public housing developed through rehabilitation)by virtue of andSection; 8.25(a)(2) of the final rule. Section 8.23 in turnallows that more than five percent of the units being altered or modernizedbe made accessible if there is a need as described in andSection; 8.23(b)(2).Paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 8.25 of the final rule revise and clarifyparagraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 8.24 of the proposed rule. Paragraphs(b) and (c) of andSection; 8.25 of the final rule set forth accessibilityrequirements with regard to existing public housing, whether or not thedwelling units are covered by a modernization program. Paragraph (b) ofandSection; 8.25 provides simply that the requirements of andSection; 8.24(a)shall apply to public housing programs. PHAs are thus required by andSection;8.25(b) to operate each of their programs or activities so that the programor activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to andusable by individuals with handicaps. This does not necessarily mean thata PHA must make each of its existing facilities readily accessible to andusable by individuals with handicaps. A PHA is also not required to takeany action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or in undue financial and administrative burdens.Paragraph (c) of andSection; 8.25 requires each PHA to assess, as soon aspossible, on a PHA-wide basis, the needs of current tenants and applicantson its waiting list for accessible units and the extent to which such needshave not been met or cannot reasonably be met within four years throughdevelopment, alterations otherwise contemplated, or other programs administeredby the PHA (e.g., Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation, Section 8 ExistingHousing or Housing Vouchers). If the needs assessment shows no need foradditional accessible dwelling units or that the need will be met withinfour years through other means, such as new construction and/or alterationsotherwise contemplated, no further action is required by the PHA. PHA needsassessments may be reviewed by HUD in connection with section 504 compliancereviews and complaint investigations. If, on the other hand, the PHA determines,on the basis of its needs assessment, that alterations to make additionalunits accessible must be made so that the needs of eligible qualified individualswith handicaps may be accommodated proportionally to the needs of non-handicappedindividuals in the same categories, then the PHA shall develop a transitionplan to achieve program accessibility. The needs assessment and transitionplan, if one is necessary, shall be completed as expeditiously as possible,but in any event no later than two years after July 11, 1988. The PHA isrequired to complete structural changes necessary to achieve program accessibilityas soon as possible but in any event within four years of July 11, 1988.However, the final rule allows up to two extensions of time. First, theAssistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the AssistantSecretary for Public and Indian Housing may extend the four-year periodfor a period not to exceed two years on a case-by-case determination byboth Assistant Secretaries that compliance with that period would imposeundue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient'spublic housing program. Second, the Secretary or the Undersecretary mayfurther extend this time period in extraordinary circumstances, for a periodnot to exceed one year. If a PHA for any reason fails to achieve programaccessibility within the timeframes in andSection; 8.25(c) it is <T3>not </T3>thereby relieved of its responsibility to achieve programaccessibility as expeditiously as possible. The transition plan must bedeveloped with the assistance of interested persons including individualswith handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps.The provision in andSection; 8.24(c) of the proposed rule that PHAs shallnot be required to make more than five percent of the units covered byany modernization project accessible has been deleted. If a properly doneneeds assessment demonstrates a need for more accessible units they maybe provided. The 15 percent project cap also has been deleted to allowaccessible units to be provided as needed.Paragraph (c) of andSection; 8.25 of the final rule also requires a PHA todescribe in detail the methods that will be used to make its facilitiesaccessible. Section 8.25(c) states that a PHA may, if necessary, providein its transition plan that it will seek HUD approval, under 24 CFR Part968, of a modernization program to meet the needs of eligible individualswith handicaps.A large number of commenters were critical of the portion of andSection;8.24(c) of the proposed rule which allows a PHA to request a waiver ofthe requirement to make additional units accessible if the alterationsrequired to do so would result in a determination under 24 CFR 968.3 thatthe project is not financially feasible. This provision has been deletedfrom the final rule. However, it should also be noted that a PHA seekingmodernization funds in whole or in part for the purpose of making unitsaccessible must meet all of the requirements applicable to the modernizationprogram.One commenter stated that the requirement in andSection; 8.24 of the proposedrule that PHAs assess the needs of current tenants and applicants is inadequatebecause dissemination of information on the availability of accessibleunits is not a reliable indicator of real demand. Paragraph (c) of andSection;8.24 of the proposed rule specifically recognized this problem by proposingthat if a PHA determines that information regarding the availability ofaccessible units has not been communicated sufficiently so that, as a result,the number of eligible qualified handicapped persons on the PHA's waitinglist is not fairly representative of the number of persons in the area,the PHA's assessment shall be required to include the needs of eligiblequalified handicapped persons in the PHA's jurisdiction. Paragraph (c)of andSection; 8.25 of the final rule retains this requirement and strengthensit by allowing either HUD <T3>or </T3>a PHA to determine that information regarding the availabilityof accessible units has not been communicated sufficiently. Such a determinationby either HUD or the PHA requires the PHA to conduct a broader needs assessmentthan it would otherwise have to conduct.<T3>Proposed section 8.25 (Final Rule section 8.26)  </T3>Section 8.25 of the proposed rule (andSection;8.26 of the final rule), whichdealt with the distribution of accessible dwelling units, was the subjectof 215 comments. Section 8.26 of the final rule, which is substantiallyunchanged from the proposed rule, applies the ``most integrated setting''concept of andSection;8.4(d), as well as the prohibition of andSection;8.4(b)(viii)against limiting the enjoyment of opportunities by a qualified individualwith handicaps, solely on the basis of handicap, to the housing context. A majority of the commenters objected to the provision in the section whichprovides for the distribution of accessible units throughout projects andsites ``subject to reasonable health and safety requirements.'' These commentersconsider this provision to be vague and fear that it will be applied arbitrarily.The purpose of this provision is to protect the interests of qualifiedindividuals with handicaps. For example, it would not be reasonable todistribute all of the accessible units in a particular high-rise projecton an upper level floor because this could create a safety hazard for tenantswith mobility impairments in the event of a fire or some other emergency.On the other hand, this provision does not allow the unnecessary segregationof qualified individuals with handicaps. Rather, the section requires that,to the maximum extent feasible, accessible units be distributed throughoutprojects and sites.  A majority of the commenters on this section also criticized the finalsentence of andSection;8.25 of the proposed rule (andSection;8.26 of the finalrule) which proposed that an elevator not be required in any multifamilyhousing project solely for the purpose of permitting the location of accessibleunits above or below the accessible grade level. These commenters interpretedthis sentence as <T3>prohibiting </T3>the provision of an elevator for the sole purposeof providing access. However, the final sentence of andSection;8.26 of thefinal rule does not contain a complete prohibition against the provisionof an elevator. It states only that andSection;8.26 shall not be construedas <T3>requiring </T3>the provision of an elevator solely for the purposeof allowing a broader distribution of the accessible units to be includedin a particular project. A recipient may choose to provide an elevatorin a particular project for any number of reasons. However, andSection;8.26of the final rule cannot be used to justify the provision of an elevator,because the Department believes that an acceptable distribution of accessibledwelling units can be achieved without incurring the considerable additionalexpense of providing an elevator. It should also be noted that andSection;8.26of the final rule does not affect the number of accessible units to bein a particularl project. Section 8.26 deals only with <T3>the distribution </T3>of accessible dwelling units.  <T3>Proposed section 8.26 (Final Rule section 8.27)</T3>  Sixty-two (62) of the comments received on the proposed rule are in reactionto andSection;8.26 (andSection;8.27 of the final rule) which requires ownersand managers of multifamily projects having accessible units to adopt suitablemeans to assure that information regarding the availability of accessibleunits reaches qualified handicapped persons and to take steps to maximizethe utilization of accessible units by qualified individuals with handicaps.Twenty-one of these comments urged that three percent of the Federallyfinanced new or remodeled housing be set aside for the mentally handicapped.The Department has not adopted this suggestion for the reasons explainedin response to similar comments received on andSection;8.23. Specifically,no set-aside is needed for mentally handicapped persons because mentallyhandicapped persons are, if otherwise qualified, eligible and able to livein any unit.   Other commenters considered the section vague suggesting that HUD establishprocedures that will more clearly promote efficient use of the units. Theproposed rule would have allowed an owner or manager to offer an accessibleunit to an eligible qualifed applicant on the waiting list requiring theaccessibility features of the vacant unit ``provided that such preferenceis not likely to delay unreasonably the availability of a unit for theapplicant at the head of the waiting list.'' After carefully reviewingthe rule in light of these comments the Department has revised andSection;8.26of the proposed rule in order to maximize the use of accessible units byotherwise qualified individuals with handicaps requiring the features ofthose units. The final rule (andSection;8.27) provides that when an accessibleunit becomes vacant it <T3>shall </T3>be offered first to a current occupant of another unit ofthe same project, or comparable projects under common control, having handicapsrequiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying aunit not having such features. If no such occupant exists, the unit shallbe offered to an eligible qualified applicant on the waiting list havinga handicap requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit. Therefore,unlike the proposed rule, the final rule requires an owner or manager tooffer a vacant accessible unit to a person requiring the features of theunit unless no otherwise qualified individual with handicaps has appliedfor or requested such a unit. In light of this change, designed to maximizethe occupancy of accessible units with persons requiring the features ofthese units, the Department has deleted the second sentence in andSection;8.26(b)of the proposed rule. Section 8.26(b) of the proposed rule stated that,if reasonable efforts have been made to assure that information regardingthe availability of accessible units reaches eligible individuals withhandicaps, an owner or manager shall not be required ``to hold an accessibleunit vacant for a longer than normal period'' in order to locate an eligibleindividual with handicaps having disabilities or impairments requiringthe accessibility features of the vacant unit. This provision would havebeen difficult to apply and enforce because it would not have been clearhow long an owner or manager would have had to hold a unit vacant. Moreover,this provision is no longer necessary in view of the requirement in thefinal rule that an owner or manager fill a vacant accessible unit withan individual or family needing its features, regardless of that individualof family's position on the waiting list. Finally, andSection;8.27(b) ofthe final rule continues to provide, as did andSection;8.26(b) of the proposedrule that, when offering an accessible unit to an applicant not havinghandicaps requiring the accessibililty features of the unit, the owneror manager <T3>may </T3>require the applicant to agree (and <T3>may </T3>incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessibleunit when available.  <T3>Proposed section 8.27 (Final Rule section 8.28)  </T3>Section 8.27 of the proposed rule, which proposed section 504 requirementsfor the Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate Program and the HousingVoucher Program, has been renumbered as andSection;8.28 of the final rule.This section has not been substantively changed from the proposed rule,except that it now applies to the Housing Voucher program as well as tothe Section 8 certificate program; it requires that, where necessary, recipientsassist families with an individual with handicaps to find an accessibleunit; and it requires assurances of nondiscrimination in recipients' contractswith participating owners.  This section was the subject or 207 comments. Most of these comments criticizedthe section believing that it exempted participating owners from programaccess requirements under the Section 8 and Housing Voucher programs. TheDepartment has carefully considered these comments and has found that theyhave some merit. The Department believes that as revised, andSection;8.28of the final rule, in conjunction with andSection;andSection;8.24 and 8.26,satisfies the program accessibility mandate of section 504 with regardto these programs. Neither the proposed rule nor the final rule ``exempts''the Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate and Housing Voucher programsfrom section 504.After thorough consideration, the Department has clarified that entities(usually PHAs) receiving annual contributions from HUD are recipients andthat owners receiving housing assistance payments from a recipient arecontractors with respect to units used under these programs, not recipients.Thus, in addition to being subject to the specific requirements containedin andSection; 8.28 of the final rule, a PHA or other entity receiving annualcontributions directly from HUD is, as a recipient, subject to the nondiscriminationrequirements of subpart A of the rule. The recipient must ensure that itoperates in a nondiscriminatory manner in its dealings with participatingowners and must insist that those owners make available to tenants unitswithin the funded program on a nondiscriminatory basis. Section 8.4(b)(1).Thus, a PHA cannot deny the participation of owners in the Section 8 certificateor housing voucher programs on the basis of handicap, and can insist byexplicit contractual provision, that owners, as a condition of their participation,act in like manner as to each of its federally subsidized units.The Department has strengthened the rule by explicitly applying the programaccessibility provisions of andSection;andSection; 8.20, 8.24, and 8.26 torecipients covered by andSection; 8.28. Thus, the recipient (usually a PHA)must ensure that its program, when viewed in its entirety, is accessible;this will entail analyzing the needs of eligible tenants and taking steps,short of those that would impose undue burdens or cause a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program or activity, to make available an adequatenumber and variety of accessible units consistent with andSection;8.26. Section8.28 imposes numerous outreach responsibilities in furtherance of thisend; in addition, HUD will expect a PHA to request an exception to theFair Market Rents under 24 CFR 882.106(a) when necessary to allow section8 certificate holders to rent accessible units (andSection; 8.28(a)(5)) orto take other steps to increase its accessible housing stock if necessary.The Department has added a new andSection; 8.28(b) requiring that recipientsobtain assurances of nondiscrimination from participating owners. It is the responsibility of the PHA, as recipient, to ensure that an owner-contractoris carrying out the PHA's program in a manner consistent with the nondiscriminationrequirements of this regulation, and to terminate from the program thosewho are not doing so, as well as to ensure that the PHA is operating theprogram as a whole in compliance with section 504. HUD will enforce bothelements of the PHA's obligation under section 504. Proposed section 8.28 (Final Rule section 8.29)There were ten comments on andSection; 8.28 of the proposed rule (andSection;8.29 of the final rule) which deals with the impact of section 504 on fourhomeownership programs: Sections 235(i) and 235(j), Turnkey III and IndianMutual Self-Help Programs. One commenter interpreted andSection; 8.28 ofthe proposed rule as proposing to allow a housing unit to be made accessibleonly if the buyer himself is handicapped. This commenter states that accessibilityshould also be requestable if other members of the family are disabled.Although andSection; 8.29 of the final rule necessarily requires that therequest that a housing unit be made accessible come from the buyer, thebuyer's request may be based upon there being a handicapped person whowill live in the house. The buyer himself need not be handicapped. Thefinal rule has been revised to make this clear. Other commenters felt that andSection; 8.28 of the proposed rule reinforcesan incorrect message that creating accessible or adaptable housing is expensiveand difficult and suggested that the section either be omitted from theregulation or revised. The omission of andSection; 8.28 from the final rulewould limit or make more difficult the participation of qualified individualswith handicaps in the four homeownership programs covered by the sectionand would be inconsistent with the purposes of section 504. On the otherhand, requiring as some commenters suggested that all housing units bemade accessible would cause an increase in the cost of homeownership toall participants, even to those who do not need an accessible dwelling.The Department believes this would go beyond what is required by section504.Section 8.30 (Final Rule)Section 8.30 of the final rule is new and deals with the Department's rentalrehabilitation program. Under the rental rehabilitation program HUD makesgrants to cities, urban counties and States to help support the rehabilitationof privately owned real property to be used for primarily residential rentalpurposes. In order to promote accessibility in the rental rehabilitationprogram and to encourage an increase in the nation's accessible housingstock andSection; 8.30 requires each grantee or State recipient in the rentalrehabilitation program to give priority to the selection of projects thatwill result in dwelling units being made readily accessible to and usableby individuals with handicaps. This priority is subject and subordinateto the priority in 24 CFR 511.10(1) for units in substandard conditionthat are occupied by very low-income families. The priority in andSection;8.30 is also subject to all of the other requirements in 24 CFR Part 511.Proposed section 8.29 (Final Rule section 8.31)Section 8.29 of the proposed rule contained accessibility requirementsregarding historic facilities. The section as revised appears as andSection;8.31 of the final rule. This section of the rule prompted 29 comments.The National Trust for Historic Preservation praised this section of theproposed rule as allowing some flexibility where historic properties areinvolved. A number of other commenters were critical of the section. Onecommenter read the section as creating a ``blanket exemption'' for historicfacilities. This is not the case. Historic facilities must be made accessibleunless such accessibility would substantially impair the historic featuresof the property or result in undue financial and administrative burdens.Several commenters suggested deletion of the ``undue financial and administrativeburdens'' language. As previously stated, the Department believes thatthis language is appropriate in light of the Supreme Court decision in<T3>Davis.</T3>The wording of the historic facilities section has been changed in a numberof respects from the proposed rule. First, the definition of ``historicproperties'' has been deleted from the section and added to andSection;8.3(``<T3>Definitions</T3>''). Second, the proposed rule contained a requirementthat if historic facilities become subject to alteration to which thispart applies and the provision of accessibility would substantially impairthe historical or architectural integrity of the property, comments shallbe obtained when required by section 106 of the National Historic PreservationAct of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470) and 36 CFR Part 800 prior to commencementof alterations. Since the comment requirement is contained in UFAS andSection;4.1.7(1),it has been deleted from the section in favor of a reference to the applicablesection of the UFAS for all programs except the Urban Development ActionGrant (UDAG) program. In the case of the UDAG program the historic preservationrequirements at 36 CFR Part 801 shall apply. These requirements relatespecifically to the UDAG program. Third, the Department has added to thedefinitions section a definition of ``substantial impairment.'' Substantialimpairment is defined to mean a significant loss of the integrity of finishedmaterials, design quality, or special character resulting from permanentalteration.  Proposed section 8.30 (Final Rule section 8.32)  Section 8.30 of the proposed rule would have made the American NationalStandards Institute ANSI A117.1-1980 (ANSI) the accessibility standardfor housing facilities or units to which HUD's Minimum Property Standardsapply, subject to any conflict with a specific provision of the MinimumProperty Standards, in which case the latter would have governed. Underthe proposed rule, ANSI would have been the standard for non-housing accessibilityand for housing to which the Minimum Property Standards are not applicable.However, HUD stated in the preamble of the proposed rule that ``[u]ponissuance of Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards by the standard-settingagencies under the Architectural Barriers Act, the Department will considerthe extent to which those standards should be adopted for Section 504 compliancepurposes.'' 48 FR 22480. The Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards wereissued by the four agencies (including HUD) responsible for establishingstandards under the Architectural Barriers Act of August 7, 1984 (49 FR31528).  The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, requires certainFederal and federally funded buildings to be constructed or altered inaccordance with accessibility standards. It also designates four agencies(the General Services Administration, the Departments of Defense and ofHousing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Postal Service) to prescribethe accessibility standards. In addition, section 502 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 established the Architectural and Transportation Barriers ComplianceBoard (ATBCB). In 1978, the Rehabilitation Act was amended to require theATBCB to issue minimum guidelines and requirements for the standards tobe issued by the standard-setting agencies. These minimum guidelines werepublished on August 4, 1982 (47 FR 33862), and are codified at 36 CFR Part1190. <T3>See</T3> 24 CFR Part 40 for HUD and Subpart 101-19.6 for GSA. In orderto ensure uniformity, the UFAS was designed to be consistent with the ATBCB'sminimum guidelines and requirements as well as with the ANSI standards.ANSI is a private, national organization that publishes recommended standardson a wide variety of subjects. The ANSI standards are frequently used inprivate practice and by State and local governments.  As previously explained with regard to the five percent accessibility requirement,the Department of Justice, as the agency responsible under Executive Order12250 for coordinating enforcement of section 504, has recommended thatagencies provide in their section 504 regulations for federally assistedprograms that, with respect to new construction and alterations, compliancewith the UFAS shall be deemed to be compliance with section 504. Becausesome facilities subject to new construction or alterations requirementsunder section 504 are also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act, government-widereference to the UFAS would diminish potential conflict between standardsenforced by the responsible funding agencies under the two statutes. Inaddition, compliance with the UFAS by Federal agencies and States willreduce potential conflicts where a building is subject to the section 504regulations of more than one Federal agency and also where it is subjectto State or local accessibility requirements as well.Apart from the Justice Department recommendation, the Department receivedmany comments in response to the proposed rule suggesting that the UFASbe made the standard for purposes of section 504 compliance in the finalrule. A number of commenters also expressed confusion regarding the relationshipbetween the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) and the ANSI standards. Inan effort to promote consistency the Department, on August 11, 1986 revisedthe MPS to reference the UFAS rather than the ANSI standards as the designand construction standard to be used where the MPS apply, (51 FR 28696,98).For these reasons, andSection; 8.30 of the proposed rule has been revised(and renumbered as andSection; 8.32) to provide that the design, construction,or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of UFAS shallbe deemed to comply with andSection;andSection; 8.21, 8.22, 8.23, and 8.25with respect to those buildings. In addition, the rule allows departuresfrom particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use ofother methods so long as the other methods employed result in substantiallyequivalent or greater access to and usability of the building in question.In addition to complying with UFAS, the alteration of housing facilitiesmust also comply with the additional scoping requirements contained inthis part.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.32 of the final rule, at the suggestion ofthe Department of Justice, modifies the effect of UFAS andSection; 4.1.6(1)(g),which provides an exception to UFAS andSection; 4.1.6, <T3>``Accessible buildings: alterations.''</T3>Section 4.1.6(1)(g) of theUFAS states that ``mechanical rooms and other spaces which normally arenot frequented by the public or employees of the building or facility orwhich by nature of their use are not required by the Architectural BarriersAct to be accessible are excepted from the requirements of 4.1.6.'' Particularly,after the development of specific UFAS provisions for housing alterationsand additions, the Justice Department believes that this UFAS provisioncould be read to exempt alterations of privately owned residential housing,which is not covered by the Architectural Barriers Act unless leased bythe Federal government for subsidized housing programs. This exception,however, would not be appropriate under section 504, which protects beneficiariesof housing provided as part of a Federally assisted program. Consequently,paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.32 of the final rule provides for purposesof this section, andSection; 4.1.6(1)(g) of the UFAS shall be interpretedto exempt from the requirements of the UFAS only spaces that, because oftheir intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or handicappedresidents or employees.Paragraph (c) of the final rule makes it clear that andSection; 8.32 doesnot require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihoodof being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structuralmember. Such an alteration would go beyond what is required by section504.UFAS andSection; 4.1.4(11) contains scoping provisions for newly constructedhousing. The UFAS requires for Federally assisted housing that five percentof the total, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, be accessiblein projects of 15 or more dwelling units. Section 8.22 of the final ruledoes not contain the 15 or more dwelling unit minimum. Accordingly, paragraph(d) of andSection; 8.32 of the final rule provides that UFAS andSection; 4.1.4(11)shall not be used to waive or lower the minimum of five percent accessibleunits required by andSection; 8.22(b) or to apply the minimum only to projectsof 15 or more dwelling units.Under paragraph (e) of andSection; 8.32 of the final rule, the accessibilityrequirements for facilities in Subpart C would apply to facilities thatare designed, constructed or altered after July 11, 1988. The date of constructionor alteration is defined as the date bids are solicited. This languagein the final rule more closely follows the language in the DOJ CoordinationRule than did the language in the proposed rule. However, the Departmentis making an exception for the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program.For the UDAG program, the Department continues to believe that the appropriatepoint to make the accessibility requirements effective is the date applicationsare submitted. The federal grant under the UDAG program is awarded onlyupon a determination that the project would not be made without the grant.The grant amount is the least amount necessary to make the project feasiblebased upon projected costs. Making the accessibility requirements applyto UDAG projects which have not begun construction or alteration beforeJuly 11, 1988 would result in a change to the HUD approved facility andbudget with the possibility that the grant would not be sufficient to coverany changes necessitated by the accessibility requirements and the projectwould become infeasible. Therefore, the accessibility requirements aremade applicable to applications submitted after July 11, 1988, so thatUDAG applicants will know of the requirements and include all necessarycosts in the application. However, if the UDAG application was submittedbefore July 11, 1988, the applicable accessibility provisions in subpartC apply to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Department.Section 8.33 (Final Rule)Section 8.33 of the final rule (<T3>``Housing adjustments''</T3>) at the suggestion of the Department ofJustice adds a new paragraph to clarify section 504 obligations appliedto housing policies and practices. These obligations are separate from,and in addition to, those imposed by andSection;andSection; 8.22-8.31. Section8.33 requires recipients of HUD assistance to make such modifications toits housing policies and practicies as are necessary to ensure that theydo not discriminate, on the basis of handicap, against qualified individualswith handicaps in Federally assisted programs or activities. In certaincircumstances a recipient may be required to adjust its policies and practicesin order to comply with the provisions of this part. For example, a recipientmight need to transfer a tenant with a heart condition to a ground-floorapartment if medical reasons would require such a transfer so that benefitsof the housing can remain available or permit a tenant with a hearing impairmentto install light signalers so that the tenant may be notified of a callerand answer the door. It should be emphasized that in all cases housingrequirements that can be demonstrated by the recipient to be essentialto its housing program need not be adjusted in accordance with this subpartif the adjustments would result in a fundamental alteration in the natureof a program or undue financial and administrative burdens.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Enforcement</ITAG>Two hundred ninety-nine (299) general comments were received on SubpartD. The largest number of these general comments (161 form comments) arecritical of the subpart because it does not impose a self-evaluation requirementon recipients. Consistent with these comments, the Department of JusticeCoordination Regulation provides that each agency regulation should includea requirement that recipients conduct a self-evaluation of their compliancewith section 504. 28 CFR 41.5(b). Consequently, the Department is addinga self-evaluation requirement to the final rule.Section 8.51 (Final Rule)Under andSection; 8.51 of the final rule each HUD recipient is required,within one year of July 11, 1988, to evaluate its current policies andpractices to determine whether they meet the requirements of this part.Any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this partmust be modified. Furthermore, the recipient must take appropriate correctivesteps to remedy any discrimination revealed by the self-evaluation. Thisthree-part self-evaluation is to be conducted following consultation withinterested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizationsrepresenting individuals with handicaps. Finally, recipients with 15 ormore employees must maintain on file, make available for public inspection,and provide to the responsible civil rights official upon request: (1)A list of the interested persons consulted; (2) a description of areasexamined and any problems identified; and (3) a description of any modificationsmade and of any remedial steps taken. The requirements of andSection; 8.51should not be confused with the physical accessibility requirements ofandSection;andSection; 8.24 and 8.25. Section 8.51 relates to policies andpractices and not physical accessibility.Section 8.50Section 8.50, requiring the submission of assurances, has been revisedin order to clarify the section.Proposed section 8.51 (Final Rule section 8.54)Section 8.51 of the proposed rule would have required recipients to takeappropriate steps to notify relevant persons and organizations that itdoes not discriminate on the basis of handicap in its HUD-assisted programsand activities. The notice section in the final rule is more specific inits requirements. It appears as andSection; 8.54 of the final rule. Paragraph(a) of andSection; 8.54 requires recipients employing 15 or more personsto take appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify relevant partiesthat it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in violation ofthis part. The paragraph goes on to describe what the notification muststate. The Department believes it would be unduly burdensome to imposea notification requirement on recipients employing fewer than 15 persons.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.54 provides that if a recipient publishesor uses recruitment materials or publications containing general informationthat it makes available to relevant parties it shall include in those materialsor publications a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a).Paragraph (c) requires that recipients ensure that members of the populationeligible to be served or likely to be affected directly by a HUD-assistedprogram who have visual or hearing impairments are provided with the informationnecessary to understand and participate in the program.Section 8.52 (Final Rule)Section 8.52 of the final rule, relating to remedial and affirmative action,is new. It was added at the suggestion of the Department of Justice. Itis patterned after the comparable provision of the section 504 regulationof the Department of Health and Human Services. 45 CFR 84.6.Paragraph (a) of andSection; 8.52 deals with remedial action. Generally,it provides that if the responsible civil rights official finds that arecipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap inviolation of section 504 or this part, the recipient is obligated to takesuch remedial action as the responsible civil rights official deems necessaryto overcome the effects of the discrimination. Furthermore, the responsiblecivil rights official may, where necessary to overcome the effects of discriminationin violation of section 504 or this part, require a recipient to take remedialaction (1) with respect to individuals with handicaps who are no longerparticipants in the program but who were participants in the program whensuch discrimination occurred or (2) with respect to individuals with handicapswho would have been participants in the program had the discriminationnot occurred.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.52 of the final rule relates to voluntaryaction that a recipient can take where the responsible civil rights officialhas not found that it has discriminated against persons on the basis ofhandicap in violation of section 504 or this part. Under andSection; 8.52(b)a recipient may take nondiscriminatory steps to overcome the effects ofconditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's programor activity by qualified individuals with handicaps.Section 8.53 (Final Rule)Section 8.53 of the final rule is also new and also was added at the suggestionof the Department of Justice. Paragraph (a) requires each recipient thatemploys fifteen or more persons to designate at least one person to coordinateits efforts to comply with this rule.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 8.53 of the final rule requires recipients employingfifteen or more persons to adopt grievance procedures that incorporateappropriate due process standards and that provide for the prompt and equitableresolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by this rule. However,such procedures need not be established with respect to complaints fromemployees or from applicants for admission to housing covered by this part.Applicants who are denied admission to HUD-assisted housing generally havea right to be notified of the reason for their ineligibility and have anopportunity to have the decision reviewed. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>24 CFR 880.603(b)(3) (Section 8 New Construction);andSection; 881.603(b)(3) (Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation); andSection;882.216 (Section 8 Existing Housing); andSection; 960.207 (Public Housing).These procedures are available in addition to the complaint proceduresprovided elsewhere in this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>Throughout subparts D and E of the proposed rule, the term ``responsibleDepartment official'' was used to refer to individuals who will performvarious different functions. For purposes of clarification the Departmenthas substituted the following terms to identify the individuals. ``Awardofficial'' is the official that has been assigned principal responsibilityfor administration of the law extending Federal financial assistance (e.g.,the Assistant Secretary for Housing, the Assistant Secretary for Publicand Indian Housing and the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning andDevelopment). The ``responsible civil rights official'' is the officialwithin HUD designated to oversee the civil rights functions. The ``responsiblecivil rights official'' will work closely with ``award officials'' in orderto ensure compliance with this rule. ``Reviewing civil rights official''is the person within HUD assigned to accept appeals from determinationsof the responsible civil rights official.Proposed section 8.52 (Final Rule section 8.55)Section 8.52 of the proposed rule related to compliance information. Itappears as andSection; 8.55 of the final rule. A number of editorial changeswere made. They do not affect the substance of the rule.Proposed section 8.53 (Final Rule section 8.56) The Department has substantially revised andSection; 8.53 of the proposedrule, dealing with the conduct of investigations, in the final rule. Itappears as andSection; 8.56 of the final rule. At the second meeting of theHUD Section 504 Task Force with representatives of major organizationsrepresenting disabled persons it was suggested that the Department reviewthe Department of Justice Federally-conducted rule (28 CFR Part 39) tosee if any of its provisions should apply to Federally-assisted programs.In reviewing the Justice Department rule the Department found that 28 CFR39.170, which establishes a detailed complaint processing procedure, containsa number of provisions which would be appropriate and useful in the contextof this rule. Accordingly, the Department has amended andSection; 8.53 ofthe proposed rule.Paragraph (a) of andSection; 8.53 of the proposed rule, providing for periodiccompliance reviews, has been clarified. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 8.56of the final rule provides that the responsible civil rights official ordesignee may periodically review the practices of recipients to determinewhether they are complying with this part and, where he or she has a reasonablebasis to do so, may conduct on-site reviews. Such basis may include anyevidence that a problem exists or that programmatic matters exist thatjustify on-site investigation in selected circumstances. Such programmaticmatters may include, but are not limited to, circumstances where the recipienthas structural changes planned or underway and failure to review on-sitecould result in completion of construction without required accessibility.The final rule also requires that HUD initiate an on-site review by sendingto the recipient a letter advising the recipient of the practices to bereviewed, the programs affected by the review, and the opportunity, atany time prior to receipt of a final determination, to make a documentaryor other submission that explains, validates, or otherwise addresses thepractices under review.Paragraph (b) of the final rule requires HUD to make a prompt investigationwhenever a compliance review, report, complaint or any other informationindicates a possible failure to comply with this part.Paragraph (b) of the proposed rule (paragraph (c) of the final rule), settingforth the procedures for filing complaints with the Department, has beenexpanded in line with 28 CFR 39.170(d). Paragraph (c)(1) of the final ruleprovides that any person who believes that he or she has been subjectedto discrimination prohibited by this part may file a complaint. In addition,any person who believes that any specific class of persons has been subjectedto discrimination prohibited by this part and who is a member of that classor who is the authorized representative of a member of that class may filea complaint.Paragraph (c)(2) of the final rule (``<T3>Confidentiality</T3>'') provides that the responsible civil rightsofficial shall hold in confidence the identity of any person submittinga complaint, unless the person submits written authorization otherwise,and except to the extent necessary to carry out the purpose of this part,including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or proceeding underthis part.Paragraph (c)(3) of the final rule (``<T3>When to file</T3>''), like the proposed rule, requires that complaintsbe filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination unless thistime limitation is extended by the responsible civil rights official. Thefinal rule clarifies that an extension may be granted for good cause shown.Good cause could be found, for example, (1) if the complainant mistakenlyfiled with the wrong agency and was not informed of the mistake withinthe 180 days; or (2) if the complainant could not reasonably be expectedto know of the act or event said to be discriminatory. The final rule alsoclarifies that a complaint mailed to the Department shall be deemed filedon the date it is postmarked. Any complaint delivered other than by mailingshall be deemed filed on the date it is received by the Department.Paragraph (c)(4) (<T3>``Where to file complaints''</T3>) provides that complaints may befiled with any HUD office. As a general matter complaints will be investigatedby the HUD Regional Office having jurisdiction over the place where thediscrimination is alleged to occur.Paragraph (c)(5) (<T3>``Contents of complaints''</T3>) specifies that a complaint shouldcontain the complainant's name and address, the name and address of therecipient alleged to have violated this part and a description of the recipient'salleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the Departmentof the nature and date of the alleged violation of this part.Paragraph (c)(6) (<T3>``Amendments of complaints''</T3>) allows for the amendment of complaintsat any time. Further, amendments to complaints such as clarification andamplification of allegations in a complaint or the addition of other recipientsmay be made at any time during the pendency of the complaint and any amendmentshall be deemed to have been made as of the original filing date.Paragraph (d) of the final rule (<T3>``Notification''</T3>) adds a requirement that the responsible civilrights official notify the complainant and the recipient of HUD's receiptof the complaint within ten (10) calendar days. Time limitations have beenadded here and throughout andSection; 8.56 of the final rule as suggestedby a number of commenters.Paragraph (e) of the final rule (<T3>``Complaint processing procedures''</T3>) provides that after acknowledgingreceipt of a complaint, the responsible civil rights official will immediatelyinitiate complaint processing procedures. A preliminary investigation maybe necessary in order to determine if HUD has jurisdiction to accept thecomplaint. Normally, this determination will be made by the responsiblecivil rights official within 20 calendar days of acknowledgement of thecomplaint. If the complaint is accepted, the responsible civil rights officialwill notify the complainant, the award official and the recipient. Theapplicant or recipient will then have an opportunity to respond to thecomplaint in writing within 30 calendar days of receiving it. The responsiblecivil rights official is authorized to attempt to resolve complaints informallywhenever possible.If the investigation reveals no violation of this rule, paragraph (f) ofthe final rule (<T3>``Dismissal of complaint''</T3>) provides that the responsible civilrights official will dismiss the complaint and notify the complainant andrecipient.If an informal resolution of the complaint is not reached, paragraph (g)of the final rule (<T3>``Letter of findings''</T3>) requires the responsible civil rightsofficial, within 180 days of receipt of the complaint, to notify the recipientand the complainant of the results of the investigation.Paragraph (h) of the final rule (<T3>``Right to review of the letter of findings''</T3>) creates a rightto review the letter of findings within 30 days of its receipt providedthere is supplementary information. The reviewing civil rights officialwill, within 60 days of the request for review, either sustain or modifythe letter of findings. If neither party requests that the letter of findingsbe reviewed, formal written determination of compliance or noncompliancewill be issued within fourteen (14) calendar days of the expiration ofthe period within which a request for review of the letter of findingscould have been made.Paragraph (i) of the final rule (<T3>``Voluntary compliance time limits''</T3>) allows a recipient ten (10)calendar days from receipt of the formal determination of noncompliancewithin which to come into voluntary compliance. If the recipient failsto meet this deadline, HUD shall proceed under andSection; 8.57.Paragraph (j)(1) of the final rule (<T3>``Information resolution/voluntary compliance''</T3>) states the Department'spolicy of encouraging the informal resolution of matters and provides thatthe responsible civil rights official may attempt to resolve a matter throughinformal means at any time. If a letter of findings making a preliminaryfinding of noncompliance is issued, the responsible civil rights officialmust then attempt to resolve the matter by informal means.Paragraph (j)(2) of the final rule (<T3>``Objectives of informal resolution/voluntary compliance''</T3>) statesthat in attempting informal resolution, the responsible civil rights officialshall attempt to achieve a just resolution of the matter and, where appropriate,obtain assurance that the recipient will satisfactorily remedy any violationsof the rights of any complainant and will take such action as will assurethe elimination of any violation of this part or the prevention of suchviolation in the future. The terms of an informal resolution shall be reducedto a written voluntary compliance agreement, to be signed by the recipientand the responsible civil rights official. The purpose of voluntary complianceagreements is to protect the interest of the complainant, other personssimilarly situated, and the public interest.The following are examples of the types of remedies that may be sought,as appropriate, in order to protect the interest of the complainant:(1) Equitable monetary relief (e.g., out-of-pocket expenses; backpay);(2) The dwelling at issue or the next available one;(3) The job at issue or the next available one;(4) A reasonable accommodation; and(5) Injunctive relief appropriate to the elimination of discriminatoryhousing practices affecting the complainant.The following are the types of provisions that the Department will seek,as appropriate, for the public interest:(1) Elimination of violations of this part;(2) Prevention of future violations of this part (e.g., through training);(3) Changes in policy;(4) Reporting requirements; and(5) Monitoring and enforcement activities.Paragraph (k) prohibiting intimidatory or retaliatory acts is unchanged(except for minor editorial changes) from the proposed rule where it wasdesignated paragraph (e).Proposed section 8.54 (Final Rule section 8.57)Section 8.54 of the proposed rule relating to the procedure for effectingcompliance appears as andSection; 8.57 of the final rule. The section hasnot been substantially changed.Proposed section 8.55 (Final Rule section 8.58)A typographical error in andSection; 8.55 of the proposed rule dealing withhearings has been corrected. Section 8.55 of the proposed rule appearsas andSection; 8.58 of the final rule. The second paragraph in paragraph(d)(2) of andSection; 8.58 of the final rule now provides that the ``administrativelaw judge may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.''Other minor editorial changes have also been made to the section.Proposed section 8.56 (Final Rule section 8.59)Section 8.56 of the proposed rule dealt with decisions and notices. Thesection appears as andSection;8.59 of the final rule. A new paragraph realtingto judicial review has been added to the section. Paragraph (g) of andSection;8.59of the final rule provides that a final decision rendered under andSection;8.58constitues final action under section 704 of the Administrative ProcedureAct (5 U.S.C. 704) and, to the extent it is not barred by other provisionsof law, such a final decision is subject to judicial review under section706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 706). Consequently, paragraphs(g) and (h) of the proposed rule appear as paragraphs (h) and (i) of thefinal rule. Minor editorial changes were also made throughout the section.In addition, the final rule more clearly identifies the HUD officials involvedin the decision notification process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart E_Practice and Procedures for Hearings</ITAG>No comments were received on subpart E. Editorial changes were made throughoutthe subpart. All but two of these changes clarify the subpart but do notalter it substantively.Section 8.62(b)(3) of the proposed rule would have allowed any amicus curiaeto request that the presiding officer propound specific questions to witnesses.The Department has deleted this provision in the final rule. Upon furtherconsideration, the Department does not consider it appropriate for an amicuscuriae to be able to participate in a hearing to this extent. However,the final rule (andSection;8.62(b)(2)) continues to provide that an amicuscuriae may submit a statement of position to the administrative law judgebefore the hearing and may submit a brief on each occasion that a decisionis to be made or a prior decision is subject to review.Subpart E also has been revised to provide that the presiding officer ata hearing will always be an administrative law judge. Given the importanceof such hearings, the Department believes that the hearing should alwaysbe conducted by an administrative law judge.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Information</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the aboveaddress.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation. Analysisof the rule indicates that it does not (1) have an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs ofprices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have a significant adverse effecton competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.Under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act),the Undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulationallows recipients to adopt the least costly means of achieving compliancewhere existing facilities are inaccessible. In addition, employers arerequired to make accommodations for qualified individuals with handicapsonly if those accommodations do not cause an undue economic hardship.The Department of Justice has reviewed and approved this rule under ExecutiveOrder 12250. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has reviewed andapproved this rule under Executive Order 12067.This rule was listed as item No. 1009 in the Department's semiannual Agendaof Regulation published on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854, 13887) under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submittedto the Office of Management and Budget for review under section 3504(h)of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments relatingto information collection requirements should be submitted to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Mangement and Budget,Washington, DC 30503, Attention: Desk Officer for HUD.
