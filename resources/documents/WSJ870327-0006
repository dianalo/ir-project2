Gottschalk Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HENGEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><TEXT>   Henley Group Inc. posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $354 million, reflecting huge restructuring charges for three of its major business groups.    The diversified concern, which was spun off last May by Allied-Signal Inc., Morristown, N.J., said the restructuring charges reflect write-downs and asset revaluations resulting from a comprehensive reappraisal of the businesses of the La Jolla, Calif.-based company.    In the year-earlier fourth period, Henley had a pro forma net loss of $53 million. Revenue in the latest period dipped less than 1% to $825 million from $830 million.    Henley said it took $286 million in pre-tax restructuring charges that are related primarily to asset revaluations and write-downs. The company took a $159 million write-down for its Fisher Scientific Group, which makes medical and scientific instruments. It also took a $99 million write-down for its manufacturing group, which makes products ranging from electronic to automobile parts, and a $28 million write-down for its chemical group, which makes industrial and specialty chemicals.    A spokesman said that Henley doesn't anticipate any more write-downs and asset revaluations in the near term, but that it couldn't make a prediction for the long term.    Last October, the company warned that it might take pre-tax charges of as much as $300 million against fourth-quarter earnings. The company also said then that it was &quot;reviewing other of its operations and may take actions that could result in additional charges of up to $100 million.&quot;    Henley also said it took a pre-tax charge of about $100 million for the amortization of goodwill, and other charges in the latest period. By the end of 1986, goodwill had been reduced to $467 million from $917 million at the beginning of the year, as a result of revaluations and amortization, the company said.    For all of 1986, Henley had a net loss of $426 million, compared with a pro forma net loss of $66 million in 1985. Revenue rose 74% to $3.17 billion from $1.82 billion.    Henley said it generated positive cash flow from its operating units during 1986. It said the sale of certain investments and business units generated additional cash flow of about $400 million during 1986 and during the current quarter.    As of Dec. 31, Henley said, it had long-term debt of $102 million and existing lines of credit of as much as $3 billion. In January, it drew down $465 million of credit to buy back Henley shares from Allied-Signal. Henley consists of 30 different businesses and other assets.    Shortly after Henley became a public company last year, Chairman Michael D. Dingman said its growth plan involved &quot;various transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, public offerings and spinoffs.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Henley shares closed at $26.75, unchanged. The company posted results for the quarter after the close of trading. </TEXT></DOC>
