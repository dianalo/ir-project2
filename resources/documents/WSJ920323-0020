Hollywood,they fumed, was invading their turf.   Now, Madison Avenue is pulling the reverse move: It'sheading West to advise the movie industry on its films.</LP><TEXT>   In a hush-hush move, Interpublic Group's McCann-Ericksonhas set up a marketing consulting division to serve clientsColumbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures, both units of SonyCorp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment unit. Dubbed the ImageGroup, the unit includes high-level McCann executives whowill work with top studio marketing executives. Theirmission: to offer insight into upcoming trends, demographicshifts and other popular culture miscellanea, to help marketand position films.   The Image Group is still in its infancy, and its exactrole has yet to be worked out. But McCann and Sony executivesconfirmed that it started operations last month. The groupwon't create advertising, just as Mr. Ovitz has no plans tocreate advertising for Coke.   Instead, the studios want to tap the ad agency group'swisdom on trends as well as what's going on in marketing in&quot;other businesses like fashion and soft drinks,&quot; says BuffyShutt, president of marketing for Tri-Star. &quot;It's gettingmore information, a bigger picture,&quot; she says. She describesthe operation so far as a &quot;round-table discussion.&quot;   McCann's consulting role marks a sharp break from typicalad agency work in Hollywood. Most studios use big ad agenciesonly to buy TV time or print space. The ad agencies not onlydon't create movie ads, but they aren't typically consultedon trends or other marketing advice. For example, McCannuntil now has only handled media buying for the two studios.   But as Columbia's president of marketing, Paula Silver,puts it: &quot;If I have an advertising agency with the biggestand best minds in the world, why can't I use them as aresource? I want great minds around me, and I wanted them tocome from a different point of view.&quot; She cautions, though,that the group at this early stage is still &quot;experimental.&quot;   McCann brings to the movie business -- where marketing isbecoming almost as important as the films themselves -- awealth of information about other types of consumermarketing.   The agency is best known for handling Coca-Cola'sworld-wide advertising as well as a big chunk of GeneralMotors advertising. It has a foot in fashion with L'Oreal,for which it creates the &quot;I'm worth it&quot; hair-coloring ads.And it caught the popular imagination with its soap-operaseries of ads for Nestle's Taster's Choice coffee, featuringtwo neighbors who just happen to be astonishingly attractive.   Some of the agency's most senior executives from bothcoasts are involved in the Image Group, including JohnDooner, McCann's president, as well as Gordon Bowen, itschief creative officer, and Rona Pashkin-Boyer, managingdirector of the Los Angeles office. The group's name standsfor &quot;Integrated Marketing and Advertising Group forEntertainment.&quot;   Despite its impressive name, the venture so far hasn'tworked on the marketing of any recent releases, such asTri-Star's &quot;Basic Instinct.&quot; But Ms. Silver says she hopes towork with Image Group executives to fashion event-marketingpromotions at baseball parks around the country for thissummer's Penny Marshall film, &quot;A League of Their Own,&quot; aboutthe exploits of a women's baseball team. She also says thegroup will likely be involved with the release later thisyear of &quot;Dracula.&quot;   The Image Group's input into the movie business is a noveltwist for the ad industry, which more typically follows whatit sees on the silver screen. Chevrolet's Lumina, Pampersdiapers and other advertisers mixed live actors withanimation after &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit,&quot; while endless carcompanies borrowed computerized special effects from lastsummer's hit &quot;Terminator 2.&quot; Rarely does that kind ofinfluence flow the other way.   The studios' hiring of the Image Group must be especiallysweet to McCann-Erickson. The agency was perceived to bepublicly embarrassed by Mr. Ovitz's marketing deal with itsprize client Coke. Competitors sniped that McCann obviouslywasn't doing enough for the big soft drink maker, or itwouldn't have needed to call in outside help.   But a McCann spokesman brushed off the speculation thatthe agency's move was an effort to match Mr. Ovitz's coup,saying its foray into the movie business was unrelated to Mr.Ovitz's push into marketing. &quot;It's unrelated. It'sunconnected,&quot; the spokesman scoffed. Coke and the Sonystudios &quot;are two different clients.&quot;   ---   Ciba Realigns Advertising                                                                                                          Ciba-Geigy Corp., a unit of Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy Ltd.,moved advertising for two brands in its consumerpharmaceutical division to Jordan, McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor,New York, and consolidated all network media-buying withKetchum Advertising, New York.   Ciba ended a lengthy search for a second agency by movingits Dulcolax laxative and Acutrim diet-pills accounts fromKetchum, a unit of Pittsburgh agency Ketchum Communications,to Jordan McGrath. The accounts billed a combined $9 millionfrom January to September last year, according to LeadingNational Advertisers. Ketchum continues to handle such Cibabrands as Eucalyptamint and Sunkist Vitamins.   At the same time, Ciba moved all its network media-buyingto Ketchum from Young andamp; Rubicam, New York. Ciba spent some$41 million in overall advertising from January to Septemberlast year.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
