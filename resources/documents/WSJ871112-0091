Arkin is darting between two offices at his mid-Manhattan law firm.    In one sits Richard Wigton, the Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. executive whose public arrest last winter made the network news. Charges against him were eventually dropped, and he is preparing to meet secretly with federal prosecutors to try to head off a new indictment.    David Sofer waits behind a closed door in the other office. The fugitive Israeli millionaire is a key figure in a case involving a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. official in London, and he has slipped into the U.S. for a separate round of secret meetings with government attorneys.    Exults Mr. Arkin: &quot;This place is like Grand Central Station.&quot; The 49-year-old lawyer is defending Mr. Wigton, Mr. Sofer and others involved in the current insider-trading scandal, and the wave of cases has given him a taste of fortune and fame. For years &quot;working as a criminal lawyer was sort of like being a clap doctor,&quot; Mr. Arkin says. &quot;Now I have a front-row seat in one of the greatest dramas ever. I am a player.&quot;    The government's insider-trading investigation -- the Full Employment Act of 1987 for lawyers, one attorney calls it -- has spawned a network of defense lawyers and federal prosecutors who trade gossip and make deals. Mr. Arkin is part of it, but he also stands apart. The other major defense attorneys in the group are suave, buttoned-down lawyers who apprenticed at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Mr. Arkin came up on the other side, defending murderers and drug dealers, among others, and his salty speech betrays his past.    &quot;Stanley and lawyers like him are driven by the enjoyment of defeating prosecutors,&quot; says John Horan, Mr. Arkin's former partner. &quot;They like tilting against the establishment. At the same time, (Mr. Arkin) cozies up to the establishment. He tries to play both sides of the street, and he does it very, very well.&quot; Mr. Arkin also likes to get his name in the paper. Recently, says an attorney for a prominent Wall Street defendant, he was amazed to learn from press phone calls that Mr. Arkin had given reporters copies of a defense legal brief before the document had been filed with the court. Adds a colleague: &quot;I don't know of any lawyer who loves publicity more.&quot;    Several years ago, when Wall Street analyst Raymond Dirks hired Mr. Arkin, Mr. Dirks tried to keep the matter secret so as not to alarm his investor clients. He says he was aghast when the news showed up in the New York Post a few days later. &quot;He leaked it to the Post!&quot; Mr. Dirks claims, still agitated about the matter. &quot;It's not good for the client to get some of the publicity (Mr. Arkin) wants to get. The story was good for him but not for me. I lost a lot of business as a result.&quot;    &quot;That wasn't something I did,&quot; Mr. Arkin responds. &quot;Ray Dirks was a totally public person, always going to the press. Whatever public position Ray Dirks has today is due to my efforts.&quot; But Mr. Arkin does argue that talking to the press can be helpful. &quot;If there is going to be a story about your client,&quot; he says, &quot;I think a lawyer who doesn't attempt to sculpture the story is doing his client a disservice.&quot;    Certainly Mr. Arkin's clients are the sort who attract media attention. In addition to Messrs. Wigton and Sofer, they include Wall Street arbitrager Salim B. Lewis, under investigation for alleged stock manipulation; Marcus Schloss andamp; Co., a securities firm linked to the Yuppie Five insider-trading case; Antonio Gebauer, a Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. banker who pleaded guilty to diverting millions of dollars in customer funds; and Matthews andamp; Wright Inc. executive Arthur Abba Goldberg, a target of a broad federal investigation of the municipal-bond industry.    Mr. Arkin is well rewarded for his work. Last year, he made $1.4 million from his legal practice and a spare-time job managing rock star Debbie Harry. &quot;I hang out a lot at the Four Seasons,&quot; he says, and at California's Golden Door resort, which he describes as &quot;a spa where high-powered people hang out to chill out.&quot; An inveterate name-dropper, Mr. Arkin boasts about having dined with people like film maker John Waters and the late artist Andy Warhol.    He met Ms. Harry when she retained him for legal work. Now, he puts together her schedule, handles her legal affairs and, perhaps predictably, sits in occasionally on her interviews. &quot;He's a very charming man and a good lawyer,&quot; Ms. Harry says.    When the current wave of insider-trading cases broke, Mr. Arkin was well positioned to take advantage of it. In the late 1970s, a disheveled financial printer named Vincent Chiarella wandered into Mr. Arkin's office. Mr. Chiarella had traded on information obtained while he was assembling tender-offer documents, and he was the first person in recent times to be criminally prosecuted for insider trading. Mr. Arkin took Mr. Chiarella's case all the way to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was reversed. The high court decided that only &quot;insiders&quot; can be guilty of insider trading and limited the definition of an insider, a ruling that has made it more difficult for the government to pursue such cases.    Mr. Arkin has helped change the process in other ways. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who is spearheading the current insider-trading investigation, credits Mr. Arkin with being among the first lawyers &quot;to engage heavily in pre-indictment advocacy&quot; for his clients -- one way of saying that he begins the battle before the government has lined up its troops.    Mr. Arkin's days are a blur of meetings and phone calls. To very important individuals like Mr. Giuliani, his manner is deferential; to lesser lights, he can be blunt, even rude. Mr. Arkin acknowledges that he once told a General Electric Co. attorney who threatened to sue Mr. Wigton to &quot;stick it.&quot; In telephone conversations, his voice is often low, his tone conspiratorial.    In face-to-face meetings with government lawyers, Mr. Arkin watches and listens keenly for telltale clues of the case against his client. &quot;You're looking for the content, for the inflection, for the degree of intensity when they talk,&quot; he says. &quot;You want to pay attention to who's in the room. Is he an assistant? Whose room is it held in? How quickly can you get an appointment? If you depend only on the literal to guide you with the government, you miss an immense amount.&quot;    Take the case of Mr. Sofer, the client named as a defendant in the London scandal. After the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint earlier this year, Mr. Arkin started working the phones to head off any criminal insider-trading indictment of his client. In secret negotiations, Mr. Arkin warned government prosecutors that if they indicted Mr. Sofer, an Israeli citizen who lives in Israel and Europe, they would probably never get their hands on him. But, Mr. Arkin said, if they agreed to give Mr. Sofer immunity from criminal prosecution, they would gain a potentially valuable witness. Mr. Arkin also argued that the government had a chance to demonstrate that it could reach beyond the U.S. to get foreign offenders.    The pitch worked. According to people familiar with the case, Mr. Sofer has agreed to give up more than $2 million in alleged insider-trading profits to settle the civil complaint. But he won't have to pay penalties or interest -- an unusually lenient arrangement, these people say. In return, Mr. Sofer is telling federal investigators how the alleged scheme worked in Europe, the alleged role of some Swiss banks and the names of people he says are co-conspirators.    In such negotiations, Mr. Arkin is helped by ties that he has cultivated over the years. One of them is to Mr. Giuliani. &quot;I've been to his house, and he's been to mine,&quot; says Mr. Arkin, who was the cohost of a party for the prosecutor at the Four Seasons when Mr. Giuliani was named U.S. attorney.    Publicly, Mr. Arkin often finds it advantageous to play the role of prosecution-basher. &quot;Stanley has been running around for years (complaining) that there is an old-boy network&quot; of former Manhattan federal prosecutors who dominate New York's white-collar criminal bar, says Robert Morvillo, a former prosecutor. A current government prosecutor even confirms that what Mr. Arkin says is true: &quot;There is an old-boy network in dealing with this office, especially when trying to negotiate a deal.&quot;    But Mr. Arkin isn't necessarily excluded from the network. Thanks to years of hard work, says a New York criminal lawyer, &quot;Stanley is an honorary member of the U.S. attorney's office.&quot;    Cultivating ties to the powerful can be a matter of survival for small firms like Mr. Arkin's, which employs six lawyers full time. To get new clients, Mr. Arkin relies heavily on referrals by major law firms. White-collar defense work &quot;is all wholesale; we get hired by other lawyers,&quot; says attorney John Siffert, who represented a defendant in the Yuppie Five case. &quot;Stanley is probably the best business-getter in town.&quot;    Now that the government is prosecuting white-collar criminals aggressively, major law firms are trying to assemble their own teams of criminal lawyers. Says Mr. Giuliani: &quot;Those people in smaller firms who have established reputations in white-collar law, like Stanley or Bob Morvillo, are going to always do fine. (But) the opportunities to become the next Stanley or Morvillo are going to be limited. The big firms are keeping more of the business.&quot;    Right now, Mr. Arkin gets many cases from two big New York law firms-Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, from which he got Messrs. Wigton and Lewis and the Marcus Schloss firm, and Shearman andamp; Sterling. As a result, a defense lawyer says, &quot;Stanley controls a lot of business&quot; and can bargain for other work in return. &quot;He's a master at being able to set fees,&quot; the lawyer adds, &quot;knowing what the market will bear.&quot;    Mr. Arkin doesn't limit himself to cash fees, either. He has accepted a gold coin collection, African dolls, and paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Burchfield. &quot;Abraham Lincoln did barter for potatoes; I've refined it,&quot; he says.    Mr. Arkin's professional rise was slow and required a little luck. He sold Fuller brushes to get through the University of Southern California and then attended Harvard Law School on scholarship. He apprenticed himself to Harris B. Steinberg, a prominent New York criminal lawyer, until the lawyer's death in 1969. Then he started his own firm with Mr. Horan and, in his big break, represented David Poindexter, who was accused of hiding Angela Davis, the 1960s radical.    &quot;Stanley won without putting on any witnesses at all,&quot; Mr. Horan recalls. &quot;He just demolished the prosecution's witnesses. It was a dicey strategy. It was a good victory.&quot;    Mr. Arkin has never shied away from taking risks. When he represented Faith Golding Perelman in a divorce case, for example, he says that he directed her to lay formal claim with the SEC to part of the one-third interest in MacAndrews andamp; Forbes Group Inc. held by her husband, corporate chieftain Ronald O. Perelman. He based the claim -- somewhat vaguely -- on a joint loan the couple had taken, and his ploy had the desired effect. Because the move interfered with Mr. Perelman's plans to buy the rest of the company, Mr. Arkin says, Mr. Perelman quickly acceded to his wife's divorce terms, agreeing to a settlement that included $3.8 million in cash.    Mr. Arkin generally sympathizes with clients accused of insider trading. Such criminal prosecution, he says, is like &quot;shooting a black-marketeer in Russia. It's an overreaction to an economic crime.&quot; He thinks that insider traders suffer enough in civil settlements with the SEC. &quot;A person who has prominence, money, position and reputation gives that up,&quot; he says. &quot;That's a great deal.&quot;    Mr. Arkin has put some of his musings on paper. He has finished about 100 pages of a novel about a middle-aged lawyer who decides to try his hand at insider trading. The man has contempt for people who can't do it right, and he commits the perfect crime. But, Mr. Arkin says, the man ultimately feels empty. His success means nothing unless he can boast about it.    While Mr. Arkin doesn't condone insider trading, he believes that seeing how his clients got into trouble has helped him concoct a fail-safe strategy. &quot;Insider traders make a mistake,&quot; he says. &quot;Never do it more than once. Never do it in your own name. And never tell your relatives.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
