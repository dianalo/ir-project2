Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule, in his first news conference since being confirmed as the agency's chief antitrust enforcer, provided the most detailed breakdown yet of his office's increasing emphasis on criminal, rather than civil, cases.    And he sought to defend that trend, which has accelerated sharply in the past two years, from attacks by some lawmakers and other critics who want the Justice Department to pay more attention to the anti-competitive threat of large industrial mergers.    Prosecuting price-fixers, bid-riggers and other so-called hard-core antitrust violators is &quot;by far the most important thing we do,&quot; Mr. Rule asserted. &quot;My No. 1 priority,&quot; he told reporters, &quot;is very simple: criminal cases and more criminal cases.&quot;    Mr. Rule disclosed that, of the record number of 146 grand juries now pursuing antitrust investigations, 35 are focusing on government procurement fraud, mostly involving work for the military.    The number of grand juries looking into alleged bid-rigging and other schemes by local military contractors to divide up markets, for example, has almost doubled during the past year, according to law enforcement officials.    These investigations focus on moving and cleaning companies, food suppliers and many other small vendors that sell services or provide everyday, off-the-shelf products to individual bases or facilities. The investigations don't involve major suppliers of weapons and equipment, Mr. Rule indicated.    Non-defense targets of antitrust inquiries disclosed yesterday include the concrete-pipe industry, industrial laundries, billboard companies and some kosher food firms.    Critics have been quick to point out that the targets of these investigations, too, tend to be smaller firms, accounting for a tiny fraction of the revenue involved in some of the large mergers the Justice Department has allowed to proceed unchallenged.    Asserting that &quot;we spread our net very broadly&quot; to include a steadily expanding group of targets, Mr. Rule warned business executives against misinterpreting the Justice Department's intentions.    The &quot;change in enforcement patterns,&quot; over recent years to include more criminal targets, he said, shouldn't be viewed &quot;as a failure to enforce the laws&quot; in general.    During the news conference, Mr. Rule also made the following points:    --Protectionist trade legislation could pose a &quot;real danger&quot; to U.S. consumers, because in some industries, foreign competition is the primary reason domestic companies are keeping a lid on prices. He didn't identify specific industries.    --Justice Department studies indicate that airline deregulation has resulted in higher fares to and from some of the &quot;hubs&quot; dominated by a single airline. But Mr. Rule indicated that he doesn't anticipate any major antitrust investigation of the issue. And he said that, overall, deregulation has &quot;conclusively&quot; benefited consumers.    --Antitrust officials hope to join the battle against organized crime by prosecuting mobsters for bid-rigging and price-fixing. &quot;I think it's definitely worth trying&quot; as a way to complement more traditional prosecution strategies, Mr. Rule said.    In a brief interview, Mr. Rule said that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting a joint investigation of companies or individuals who may have violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law by purchasing stock through investment banking firms as part of a hostile takeover bid, but then failing to report such purchases to federal antitrust officials.    Mr. Rule declined to identify any targets of the investigation or indicate when details may become public.    Last December, FTC officials raised the issue in an unusual public warning that speculators and others could face substantial civil penalties for using investment banking firms to acquire large blocks of shares on their behalf to skirt pre-merger notification requirements. </TEXT></DOC>
