 Theoutcome could have a major impact on users and vendors for the next ten tofifteen years.andM;The shift in focus has been remarkable.andP;  At the Desktop Publishing Conferencelast September, the concern was that font technology (Adobe's in particular)was being used as a wall to protect the Adobe PostScrip market from theintrusion of PostScript clones.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  2, pp.andP;  20-25).andP;  This wasa variation of an age-old theme.andP;  Typesetting hardware manufacturers hadalways regarded their typefont libraries as their biggest protection againstcompetition.andP;  Adobe was now using not the library per se but the fonttechnology.andP;  Fonts encoded in the compact, encrypted and hinted Adobe Type 1outline font format could not be used on none-Adobe PostScript machines.andP;  Norcould font vendors not licensed by Adobe convert their fonts into the theproprietary Adobe format.andM;The need for font compatibilityandM;This situation forced people to think hard about the importance of fontcompatibility between devices.andP;  It quickly became clear that this is a veryserious problem.andM;The only way to assure users of full compatibility between devices is to havefull font compatibility between them.andP;  Everything must be the same: thecharacter set, character widths, even character shapes.andP;  Any variation--onedifferent character in one font, one difference in character widths betweenone device and another, even a difference in character shape that makeskerning values that are appropriate for one set of shapes inappropriate foranother--causes real problems for the user.andM;Screens and printers.andP;  By &quot;device&quot; we mean any device upon which typecharacters are displayed: a screen, dot-matrix printer, laser printer, highresolution imagesetter--whatever.andP;  If type fonts are not exactly compatiblefrom device to device, you cannot format a document for one device (screen orprinter) and expect to output it on another without reformatting.andM;Parallel font libraries.andP;  The first reaction many vendors had to this problemwas to attempt to build parallel font libraries.andP;  Initially, many PostScriptclone vendors thought that it would suffice to duplicate the 35 fonts builtinto the Laser-Writer Plus ROM, which form the foundation of the PostScriptfont library.andP;  They would contract with Bitstream or some other supplier toobtain fonts that had been massaged to have the same character widths (butnot exactly the same shape) as the Adobe/Linotype fonts.andM;There were two problems with this approach:andM;1.andP;  Matching character sets and widths is not always sufficient.andP;  To bereally precise you must match the shape of the characters as well.andM;2.andP;  The whole premise of the undertaking was flawed.andP;  Over the long term,users will not be satisfied with only 35 fonts.andP;  People complain that theAdobe font library still contains &quot;only&quot; 480 fonts!andP;  It was clear to everyonethat it would be an impossible task to shadow the entire Adobe PostScriptfont library font for font, character for character.andM;Duplicate libraries.andP;  Seeing these problems with the parallel font libraryapproach, Bitstream next tried a different direction: it acquired technologythat allowed it to put its fonts into encrypted (but not hinted) Adobe TypeOne format.andP;  This meant that it could tell users that if they would useBitstream's font library rather than Adobe's, they would be able to buy twoBitstream versions of each font: one to run on Adobe PostScript machines, andthe other to run on non-Adobe devices (display screens, PostScript cloneprinters that use the Bitstream technology, and HP LaserJets and LaserJetclones).andM;However, there were still problems with this approach:andM;1.andP;  It only works if everyone is use Bitrstream fonts.andP;  Since most PostScriptusers have Adobe fonts, they are likely to continue to create documents usingthese fonts.andP;  Since the Bitstream fonts are different from the Adobe fonts,you will not be able to run a job formatted for Adobe fonts on a printer thatuses Bistream fonts.andM;2.andP;  It requires the user to buy two font libraries from Bitstream: one forAdobe machines and a second for other devices.andP;  It also means that Bitstreamhas to take extraordinary pains to insure that the two libraries are, infact, exactly compatible.andM;The walls crumbleandM;At the Seybold Seminars in March, it became clear that the situatuion hadchanged dramatically.andM;First, Adobe's font encryption had been broken by Bitstream and RIPS.andO;Second, Folio (which is owned by Sun) demonstrated the TypeMaker andTypeSclaer programs, which produce and render hinted fonts; the F3 fontformat is open for licensing to all comers.andP;  Third, Adobe had broadened itslicensing to include Compugraphic, Varitype and Monotype.andM;New frame of referenceandM;The big change that occurred in March was a shift in the whole frame ofreference for font issue.andP;  Until now, the principal focus has been on outputtechnology--an area where Adobe and Hewlett-Packard (LaserJet) have the lead.andO;Screen displays have used pre-prepared font bitmaps, carefully tuned toapproximate the output printer fonts as closely as possible.andM;Now, suddenly, that is going to change.andP;  Scalable font technology is movinginto screen displays.andP;  As it does, people will no longer be preoccupied withwhether the fonts used on printer A match the fonts used on printer B.andP;  Theywill be much more concerned about ensuring that the fonts they use on aprinter match those they use to compose a document on their screen.andP;  Thisshift completely alters the landscape.andM;Open font format.andP;  One way of accomplishing this would be to leave the fontrendering portion of the graphic screen display &quot;open&quot; to different fonttechnologies.andP;  Different companies (Folio, Adobe, Bitstream, Compugraphic,etc.) could offer their own &quot;TypeScaler&quot; modules that would accept fontsencoded in their format and render them on the screen.andP;  Users could buy thefont technology and corresponding font library that corresponds to the outputdevice they intend to use.andM;This very approach has been proposed by IBM for inclusion in OS/2Presentation Manager.andP;  It makes sense if you assume that you have toaccommodate a variety of different type formats: you simply provide astandard mechanism for all to use and let the market fight it out.andM;But the results for the user would be chaos.andP;  Can you imagine the mess ofdealing with different font rendering schemes and different font librariesassociated with different output devices?andP;  As an industry we are trying tomove towards a situation based upon heterogeneous systems in which weintermix devices supplied by different manufacturers.andP;  We doubt that a Towerof Babel approach to font technologies could survive.andP;  Eventually one or twode facto standards would emerge and everyone would have to conform to those.andM;Built-in font technology.andP;  It now appears that the major systems companiesrealize: a) that scalable font technology is an essential ingredient in agraphic screen environment, and b) that this should a system function that isbuilt into the imaging model supplied with the operating environment.andP;  Themess of multiple font technologies and multiple font libraries is just tooawful to contemplate.andM;Driver's seat.andP;  In short, the battleground for font technology is shiftingaway from output printers and towards screen displays.andP;  As it does, we entera new playing field with new players and new rules.andM;A model for the futureandM;Where are we heading?andP;  We think that the objectives are clear to everyone:andM;1.andP;  Users want a common imaging model for screen and output.andP;  This is thebest way to ensure that what you see on the screen is what you will get offyour printer/imagesetter.andM;2.andP;  Common font technology and a common font library is even more importantthan a common imaging model.andP;  When you get right down to it, the biggestproblems in incompatibility between screen and output center aroundtypefonts.andP;  If you have complete typefont compatibility, you can probablylive with conversion of graphics (lines, curves, pattern fills etc.) from oneimaging model to another.andP;  The only way to be certain of complete typefontcompatibility is to use the same fonts and the same font rendering technologyon the screen and the output device.andM;3.andP;  The distinctions between technology used for screen display and that usedfor printer output will disappear.andP;  Rich graphic imaging models for screendisplay, increasingly powerful desktop computers and multi-tasking operatingsystems will make it increasingly attractive to use the same RIP software todrive screen display and output recorder.andM;The Next 400-dpi laser printer is a prototype of what you will see in thefuture:andM;* A single user simply plugs the dumb laser printer directly into a highspeed data channel connection to his workstation.andP;  The multi-taskingoperating system allows printing to be performed as a background function.andM;Since the computer processor and memory are being shared between userapplication tasks and printer controller tasks, there will be a definiteperformance penalty.andP;  However, with enough processing power in the desktopworkstation and enough memory, the performance should be satisfactory forpersonal use--especially if you remember that printing functions are beingperformed in the background and can take place while the computer is beingused for other things.andM;* In a networked environment, the printer attached to one workstation can beshared by others across the net.andM;* In a larger configuration, the printer is attached to a workstation thatserves as a shared file server.andM;* For still higher loads, a complete workstation is dedicated for use as aprint server/controller.andP;  It runs the full network operating system and is afull network citizen.andP;  Because it is produced in higher volume, it may evencost less than a dedicated printer controller of equal power and capability.andM;It would even be possible to connect everal less frequently-used printengines (such as a color proof printer and a slide film recorder) to the samecomputer/controller.andM;* Very high speed printers needing multiple parallel processors and otherspecialized hardware still use controllers optimized for the printingapplication and/or special-purpose printer controller cards that plug into aworkstation bus.andM;The consequence of using the screen imaging model to drive output recordsdirectly is that the GPI (Presentation Manager) imaging model and apple'sQuickDraw language are much more important long-term threats to Adobe thanany PostScript clone ever was.andM;Situation reversed.andP;  The consequence of this kind of world would be tocompletely reverse the situation that existed up through last September.andO;Until now, fonts and font technology have been barriers that keep competitionout and protect a market position.andP;  A widely accepted open font technologywould reverse that situation.andP;  Once the largest portion of the market hasadopted an open font technology, anyone who does not conform to the openstandard suddenly finds himself on the outside looking in.andM;The chilling thought for Adobe must be a vision of a future in which OS/2Presentation Manager with an open font technology is in widespread use and PCusers have a choice of a variety of GPI printers.andP;  If Microsoft uses adifferent scalable font technology and a different font library than Adobe,OS/2 users will find it much easier to use a GPI printer than a PostScriptone.andM;The players: action and reactionandM;Now that we have set the stage, let us look at what has taken place sinceMarch.andM;Five formats.andP;  In our previous issue (Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  8, page 8), we identifiedthe five leading font formats:andM;* Adobe PostScript formatandM;* Sun/Folio F3andM;* Apple QuickDraw outline font format (not announced at that time, but widelybelieved to be a proprietary Apple format)andM;* Microsoft GPI (not yet selected)andM;* Compugraphic Intellifont to be used in the PCL Level 5 LaserJets.andM;Our contention was (and is) that there simply is no room in the market forany additional formats.andP;  In fact, as we will argue in a moment, we do noteven believe that the market can or will support five different font formats.andM;Let's look at each of the five players:andM;MicrosoftandM;In essence, Microsoft announced at the March Seminars &quot;open season&quot; for fonttechnology suppliers.andP;  It appears to have finally decided that it willinclude a font technology in Presentation Manager (and, we presume, Windows).andO;If Microsoft makes its format an &quot;open&quot; one (it has nothing to lose andeverything to gain by doing so), this really means that there is not going tobe much room in the market for a sixth font technology.andP;  Any additionalplayers (Bitstream, Nimbus Q, etc.) that are not chosen by Microsoft aregoing to have a hard time finding a market niche left.andP;  These companies canstill supply typefonts in someone else's format, but we believe that theywill have lost the chance to be significant suppliers of font technology.andM;The result, of course, has been a made scramble by everyone with fonttechnology to convince Microsoft to adopt their technology.andP;  This is a highstakes game.andP;  The winning technology almost certainly becomes a dominantindustry standard.andM;Hewlett-PackardandM;PCL Level 5 is supposed to include scalable font technology and support forHPGL graphics.andP;  We had expected to see PCL Level 5 printers in the marketlong before this.andM;We believe that the principal reason HP chose Compugraphic (CG) fonttechnology is so that LaserJet printer users could have access to compatibleCG high-resolution output devices (just as Apple LaserWriter users havealways had access to linotype PostScript machines).andP;  This was a valid concerna couple of years ago when the decision was made.andP;  Now there are otherconcerns (such as compatibility with Microsoft's screen imaging model) thatwe think are more important.andM;If Microsoft chooses CG's technology, HP is in clover.andP;  If it does not, HPwill find that PM users have incentive to use GPI printers (which arecompatible with the GPI screen fonts) rather than HP printers (wich requiredifferent fonts).andM;Since PCL Level 5 is not in the field, if we were HP we would wait forMicrosoft's decision, then conform to that.andM;Sun/FolioandM;Sun/Folio currently has the leading &quot;open&quot; format with software (TypeMaker)that makes it relatively easy for font foundries to convert their fonts toFolio F3 format.andP;  &quot;Open,&quot; in this case, means that Folio will license boththe TypeMaker software (to put fonts into F3 format) and TypeScaler (torender F3 format fonts as output bitmaps) to anyone and that there arepublished licensing terms and fees.andP;  All portions of the  software thatrequire porting or translation are provided as source code.andP;  Other portionsare provided as object code.andM;Folio has also promised to publish the F3 font format so that anyone whowants (and is able) can create fonts in F3 format using whatever tools hedesires for this purpose.andP;   Presumably, once the format is published, thirdparties could also write their own rendering software to generate scaledcharacter bitmaps from F3 outlines.andM;In the long run, Folio's position as an open independent format may dependheavily on what Microsoft decides to do.andM;Adobe Type ManagerandM;Adobe Systems has been working for over a year on packaging its fontrendering technology as a module that could be used for screen display andthat could also be licensed to other (non-Adobe) printer controller companiesfor inclusion in their controller software.andM;The week before the Apple developer's meeting, Adobe called a pressconference to announce its Type Manager font rendering module.andP;  Type Managerwill use the same Adobe outline fonts that are currently used in AdobePostScript printers.andP;  It will provide on-the-fly generation of characterbitmaps for screen display or printer output.andM;Type Manager will be offered both as an end-user package and as an OEM modulethat can be used by computer and system software vendors.andP;  The Macintoshversion will be released first, sometime this fall.andP;  Other verisons willfollow.andM;Macintosh implementation.andP;  Because Apple will be using its own fonttechnology (see next section), Adobe will sell the Macintosh Type Managerdirectly to end users.andP;  Adobe tells us that once a user has installed theAdobe module on his Mac, neither he nor his application software has to worryabout it.andP;  When he uses an Adobe font, the Type Manager will automaticallygenerate the required bitmaps for screen display.andM;In practice, this means that a Macintosh user with System 7.0 software andADobe Type Manager will actually have two font rendering routines for twodifferent font technologies resident in his machine.andP;  The system will use thefont rendering scheme appropriate for the font(s) being used.andM;This is a pretty tall order.andP;  It means that Adobe will have to make its fontrendering softweare work transparently with the Apple system software--almostcertainly without any help from Apple.andM;Timing.andP;  Adobe has announced what it intends to do but has not yet publiclydemonstrated anything.andP;  It says that the first release of the Macintoshversion of the product will be available in the fall.andM;Output printers.andP;  This initial version will be intended for screen displayonly.andP;  Adobe says that it expects that the Type Manager will be able to drivenon-PostScript printers as well.andP;  This means, we suppose, that it will beable to drive both dot matrix and QuickDraw laser printers.andP;  The principalissues, we are told, involve the licensing agreements for the Adobetypefonts, not technical feasibility.andM;Other notes.andP;  Other points of interest:andM;1.andP;  The current version of Type Manager works only on Roman faces (not Kanji)and only on encrypted Adobe Type 1 (not third party Type 3) PostScript fonts.andM;Adobe is considering publishing a Type 1 format for use by third parties.andM;2.andP;  Adobe says that its package will run in a 1-MB Mac, but will work betterin a 2-MB machine.andP;  Apple's own software will require either a 2-MB machineor a machine with more system software built into ROM.andP;  (See The Latest Word,this issue.)andM;3.andP;  Although Apple told Adobe about its outline font technology and hintingtechniques before the announcement, it did not tell Adobe about all the neatthings that it is doing with Layout Manager and font metrics.andP;  We do not knowwhat (if anything) Adobe will be able to do about this.andP;  If Adobe fonts donot contain the additional information, then Macintosh Layout Manager willnot be able to do the clever things with Adobe fonts that it will be able todo with Apple fonts.andM;&quot;Semi-open&quot; font technology.andP;  This announcement represents a major change ofdirection for Adobe.andP;  It is now embarked on a course of selling or licensingits font rendering technology separate from PostScript.andP;  As in the past, thisis not a Folio-style &quot;open to all comers&quot; licensing strategy.andP;  Adobe willoffer end-user products such as the Macintosh Type Manager, and it willnegotiate specific arrangements with specific companies that would like toincorporate the Adobe font rendering technology into their display andprinter products.andM;More-open licensing for the font rendering technology follows the Marchannouncement that Adobe was opening up licensing of its font digitizingsoftware by licensing Monotype, Compugraphic and Varietyper to make AdobePostScript fonts.andP;  Again, this is no &quot;open to all comers&quot; licensing, butspecific agreements with specific (very important) font vendors.andM;As noted above, Adobe may decide to publish an open data standard for TypeOne fonts.andP;  This would allow any font foundry to prepare Type One fonts thatcan be rendered by the Adobe Type Manager facilities.andP;  IT would also allowother vendors to build their own processors that can rasterize fonts encodedin this form.andM;Taken together, these changes do not move Adobe fully into the Folio &quot;openfont technology&quot; category, but they represent dramatic strategic and tacticalshifts from Adobe's previous position.andM;AppleandM;On May  9, while this issue is at the printer, Apple will brief its systemdevelopers on the features planned for its next major system release, System7.0.andP;  We have summarized the system improvements (which are substantial) inthe Latest Word section of this issue nsee pages 51-53).andP;  We will cover themin more detail in our next issue.andM;For most users, the most dramatic improvement in System 7.0 will certainly bethe new font technology.andP;  Publishing users will be particularly impressed.andO;Apple will be building the basis for amazing typographic sophistication intoevery Macintosh.andM;Outline fonts.andP;  System 7.0 will include support for outline fonts.andP;  Whenevera new font/size combination is required, the system software will check firstto see if it has a pre-computed screen bitmap for the font/size combination.andO;If not, it will create the screen bitmaps as needed from outline font masterson a character-by-character basis.andM;After looking at the available outline font formats, Apple decided that itdid not like any of them and would develop its own instead.andP;  It will publishthe format and encourage anyone who wishes to make and market Macintoshoutlien fonts.andM;Outlines are expressed in terms of quadratic curves.andP;  Quadratics were chosenover Beziers, conics or other curve technologies primarily for fastcomputation times.andM;The Macintosh creates character bitmpas for screen display or printer outputon a character-by-character basis on the fly as needed.andP;  Only charactersactually used will be rasterized.andP;  The demonstrations we have seen so far(running on a Mac II) appear to be impressively fast.andP;  As you would expect,screen painting times start out a little slowly whenever a new font/sizecombination is required, but quickly pick up speed as a higher and higherproportion of the characters encountered have already been cached as screenbitmaps.andP;  Apple tells us that System 7.0 will create raster bitmaps oftypical text-sized characters at approximately 100 cps on a Mac II.andP;  Giventhe typical mix of upper- and lower-case characters, this means that the userwill see a cumulative extra delay of less than a second when he switches to anew font/size combination.andP;  We expect that rasterizing on a 68000-basedmachine such as a Mac Plus or SE will take three or four times as long.andM;Once characters have been rasterized, they are stored as bitmaps in memory.andO;The system software will use all memory not required for application programsas font cache.andP;  If the user launches a new program, the least-recently usedfont bitmaps will be overwritten in memory.andM;Once a character has been rasterized and stored in memory, screen speeds fordisplay are essentially the same as they are with the current bitmappedfonts.andM;Hints.andP;  The quality of screen display is aided by the most elaborate systemof hints we have yet seen.andP;  In essence, Apple appears to have done a completesurvey of the hinting techniques used in all the the other outline fonttechnologies, then created a hinting language that includes a superset offunctions similar to those each of the other vendors have, plus additionalfunctions and logic that effectively creates a programming language fortelling the font scaling program how to adjust a character shape to get thebest bitmapped output.andM;Fonts that have been given the full hint treatment appear to renderremarkably well on the screen, even at small sizes.andP;  We do not see any reasonwhy Apple will have to resort to hand-tuned screen bitmaps for fonts thathave been properly encoded with the full set of Apple hints.andM;Character metrics.andP;  There is more.andP;  The character metrics can include a greatdeal of information about character shape, character kerning values and thelike.andP;  This can be amazingly comprehensive.andP;  The outline data for a typicalserif font will fit in 40-50K of storage.andP;  A full set of metrics and kerningvalues can easily double the amount of storage required.andM;The metrics will support accurate placement of superiors and inferiors andthe generation of Rubis (phonetic pronounciation identification forless-frequently used Kanji characters).andM;Layout Manager.andP;  The new fonts will be complemented by a new characterdrawing program called Layout Manager.andP;  Application programs will typicallyrely on Layout Manager to actually paint characters on the screen.andP;  LayoutManager will perform such exotic functions as on-the-fly kerning ofcharacters (based on the kerning values in the font metric tables) as itpaints them on the screen.andP;  This means that this sort of typographicrefinement will be available to every Macintosh program that cares to use it.andM;There is even a function that will stretch portions of characters to joinwith other characters, as is required for cursive writing or for kashidas inArabic.andM;Character sets.andP;  The Macintosh character set will also be expanded (to 25symbols).andP;  Unfortunately, it still does not include fractions (boo!).andP;  Wehope Apple will build into Layout Manager automatic support for creatingpiece fractions.andM;System requirements.andP;  System 7.0 will require a 2-MB Macintosh.andM;Font availability.andP;  Apple itself will provide a base set of 15-20 fullyhinted fonts.andP;  Beyond this, it wants to encourage third parties to converttheir fonts into the Apple format.andP;  As noted above, it will publish theformat and encourage anyone an d everyone to sell QuickDraw outline fonts.andM;But there is a problem.andP;  Apple does not have anything equivalent to theSun/Folio TypeMaker facility that can take existing, un-regularized characteroutlines and convert them into the required format with all the informationneeded for automatic insertion of the font scaling hints.andM;Instead, Apple expects that font foundries will write programs to converttheir existing outline data into the QuickDraw quadratic curves and toconvert their existing hints into the equivalent Apple hints.andP;  We do not knowyet how difficult this will be.andP;  App le says that it is a very straighforwardprocedure.andP;  A few font foundries have told us that it is a little morecomplicated than that, but that it certainly is doable.andM;The problem is that the converted fonts will contain no more hintinginformation than did the original source data.andP;  But many font libraries thatwere originally digitized for high-resolution output do not contain any hintsat all!andP;  Others contain hints, but not the level of hints that are requiredfor attractive rendering of text sizes at screen resolutions.andP;  The conversionprocess will not magically create the additional hints required for screendisplay out of thin air.andM;We expect, therefore, that most of the straight conversions into Apple formatwill produce pretty poor screen fonts at small sizes.andP;  Font vendors that wantto attract customers will probably either have to supplement the outlinefonts with hand-tuned bitmaps for small text sizes or go to the extra work ofinserting the full complement of Apple hints required for attractive screendisplay.andM;Either of these approaches takes time and effort.andP;  Different font suppliersmay make different decisions about how much work they want to invest in eachQuickDraw font conversion.andM;Apple expects that clever third parties will be able to develop tools thatsupport largely automatic conversion of original font outlines intofully-hinted Apple QuickDraw format.andM;QuickDRaw futures.andP;  With the avent of 32-bit color QuickDraw (see page 49,this issue), the new font technology, and other improvements to QuickDrawdrawing and rendering capabilities, Apple is certain to encourage aproliferation of QuickDraw output printers.andM;It is eminently rational to use the same imaging model (and even the samesoftware) for screen display and hard copy output.andP;  We expect to seeincreasing emphasis on QuickDraw output printers and recorders, for bothcolor and monochrome work.andP;  All of the font technology will carry directlyover to the printers.andP;  The color technology includes some tricks that will beapparent only at 300 dpi and better output resolutions.andM;Apple vs.andP;  AdobeandM;Not suprisingly, Adobe sees all of this as a threat to its position in theMacintosh market.andP;  The Macintosh scalable font technology and scalable fontlibrary will be different from the Adobe technology and the Adobe library.andO;Adobe fonts would not work with the Apple technology.andP;  apple fonts would notwork on Adobe PostScript printers.andM;This means, of course, that Macintosh users would face a barrier to usingAdobe PostScript printers: the scalable fonts available on their Macintoshwould not match the fonts available on the PostScript printers.andM;Alternatives.andP;  This really left Adobe with two alternatives:andM;1.andP;  It could undertake to built tools to convert its fonts into Apple format.andO;This must have looked unattractive for four reasons: a) It would be a lot ofwork.andP;  b) Once the Adobe fonts were converted to Apple format, they would beout of Adobe's control.andP;  They could be used on QuickDraw printers orPostScript clone printers that used the Apple font format.andP;  c) The user wouldstill have to deal with two font libraries, one for screen display andQuickDraw printers, the other for Adobe printers.andP;  There would certainly betemptation to simply use the Adobe fonts on QuickDraw devices and forgetabout PostScript.andP;  d)  The number of fonts that must be converted is growingweekly.andP;  The Adobe PostScript font library currently stands at over 480fonts.andP;  With the recent deals with Compugraphic, Monotype and Varityper, itwill soon be growing much faster than before.andM;2.andP;  It could offer its own Type Manager screen display technology than cangenerate screen bitmaps of Adobe fonts.andM;This is what Adobe has chosen to do.andM;Confusion for the user.andP;  The net result of all of this is that Macintoshusers will be faced with two font technologies and two font libraries: Appleand Adobe.andP;  Eventually, the Adobe technology and the Adobe library will beable to be used on screen displays, QuickDraw printers and Adobe printers.andO;The Apple technology can be used for screen display and QuickDraw printers,but not on Adobe PostScript machines.andP;  On the other hand, the Appletechnology will include much more  sophisticated information about charactershape.andP;  End-users are certain to grumble &quot;why can't these guys get together?&quot;andM;Solutions.andP;  Both Apple and Adobe are aware of the problem.andP;  Apple, naturallyenough, wants to make its QuickDraw fonts work with Adobe printers.andP;  Adobedoes not want there to be barriers that will make it difficult for Macintoshusers to use PostScript output devices.andM;One solution would be to encourage development of two closely synchronizedparallel font libraries (one copy of each font in Adobe format, another inApple format).andP;  Some font vendors will certainly decide to do this.andP;  They will have to be extremely careful.andP;  Even minor variations from one version ofa face to another will give the user fits.andM;Automatic conversion.andP;  Another solution would be to convert the QuickDrawfonts into Adobe Type One format to run on Adobe printers.andP;  Adobe has nowagreed to write software to do this.andP;  We do not yet know precisely how itwill be done.andP;  (The two formats are quite different.)andP;  We expect that Adobewill convert the Apple outlines and use its own hint-insertion software toinsert the hints required for proper output on 300-dpi laser printers.andM;All in all, Adobe will be doing quite a bit to make the dual-font situationas tolerable as possible for the user.andP;  It will supply software to render itsfonts on Apple screens and output devices, and it will develop software torender Apple fonts on its output devices.andM;Next stepsandM;There is still more to come.andP;  The Apple/Adobe saga will certainly attract afair amount of attention for at least the balance of this year.andP;  But thebiggest questions at this point surround Microsoft.andP;  What font technologywill it choose, and how will the rest of the industry react?andM;Objectives.andP;  Our position on all of this is very clear: we would love to seea single, open font standard with a single font library and open competitionto supply fonts.andP;  We really do not want to spend the next decade or twoworrying about font compatibility problems.andM;The industry may not get all the way to a single standard, but we are willingto bet that there will be fewer than five.andP;  We think that there is a verystrong possibility that there will be no more than three (Adobe, Apple,Microsoft), and maybe even fewer than that.andM;We are also willing to bet that all will ultimately have to be &quot;open&quot;standards with published font formats and largely automatic conversion andhint-insertion programs to speed conversion of fonts.andP;  The sales of fontswill be completely  decoupled from the sales of output devices.andM;In any event, there will be a lot more to talk about on the font technologyfront as the year progresses.andP;  You are watching history in the making.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
