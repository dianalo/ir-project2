McCarthy   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><IN>COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)</IN><LP>   ATLANTA -- The Southeast is sweltering through its sixthweek of searing heat, and state agriculture officials arebeginning to worry that, without some significant rain in thenext week or two, farmers could face a disaster on the scaleof the 1986 drought.   Suffering from below-normal rainfall and a heat wave thathas pushed thermometer readings up past 100 degrees,Southeastern states have reported dismal crop conditions inthe past week. In Georgia, 53% of the state's corn crop and47% of its soybean crop are rated poor or very poor. InMississippi, 11% of the state's soybeans received the samerating. In South Carolina, the corn crop's expected yield isdropping daily. A spokeswoman for South Carolina'sagriculture department said, &quot;All our corn crop is prettywell zapped.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Though agriculture officials said it is too early totabulate dollar damages, some clearly believe these could behigh. &quot;Unless we get some relief in the next week,&quot; BryanPatrick, a federal agriculture official in South Carolina,said, &quot;we're going to repeat 1986.&quot;   It was then that the drought-stricken Southeast, facedwith hundreds of millions of dollars in crop damages, wasgranted federal drought aid to assist the more than 180counties that were declared agricultural disaster areas.   &quot;It's too early to write off everything,&quot; GeorgiaAgricultural Commissioner Tommy Irvin said. But the dryspell, he said, has &quot;the potential of being one of the worstever.&quot;   As in 1986, the latest heat wave is expected to havelittle effect on commodity prices, because the Southeastproduces a relatively small amount of most crops. By someestimates, Georgia and the Carolinas, for example, accountfor only 3% of the nation's corn acreage and about 5.5% ofthe soybean acreage. &quot;It'll be a hardship for our people,&quot;Bill Yates, a Clemson University extension programcoordinator, said. &quot;But there won't be any significantchanges in market price&quot; nationally.   Poultry may be another matter. Because the Southeast is aleading poultry producer, the troubles there could lead toslightly higher chicken prices nationwide, some people in theindustry said. The extreme heat has reduced the appetite andthus the weight of chickens, according to the SoutheasternPoultry and Egg Association in Decatur, Ga. Chickens thatnormally grow to 4.5 pounds are weighing in at less than fourpounds.   If the heat wave continues for two more weeks, said HaroldFord, executive director of the association, U.S. chickenprices &quot;could easily jump four cents to five cents a pound.&quot;   So far, chicken deaths in the region haven't been nearlyas big a problem as in 1986, when Southeastern poultryproducers lost 750,000 broilers in the first week of the heatwave in July. The producers learned from that experience, Mr.Ford said, and now use more fans and other devices to keepchickens cooler.   By most reports, it seems that the corn crop has been hurtthe most in the Southeast. In Georgia and the Carolinas,which have had some of the severest weather, the loss alreadycould amount to one-third of the expected corn crop,estimated Peter Leavitt, a forecaster with Weather ServicesCorp., in Bedford, Mass. &quot;The heat and drought came earlyenough to catch the corn during the pollination stages,&quot; hesaid. At that point, he said, &quot;it's really irreversible.&quot;   Soybeans, which tend to do relatively better in the heat,have been hurt, too. On acres planted in Georgia, about 10%to 15% of soybeans have been lost, partly under attack frominsects that proliferate in hot and dry soils, said James LeeAdams, chairman of the American Soybean Association. He saidsome farmers delayed a second planting of soybeans because ofthe heat, and as a result, they didn't plant 35% to 40% ofthe acres initially planned for that crop.   The Southeast's large tobacco crop, which needs lessmoisture than some other plants do, has had some strain, buthas been relatively unaffected by the heat, agricultureofficials reported. Dried-up pasture has forced some farmersto feed their cattle hay that they had intended to use laterthis year.   Some meterologists believe a temporary break in theregion's scorching conditions could come later this week.Charles Notis, a forecaster with Freese-Notis Weather Inc. inDes Moines, Iowa, said rains moving from the Corn Belt couldarrive in the Southeast by tomorrow, Friday or Saturday,bringing temperatures down to the 80s from the high 90s to100s. &quot;For the short term, the situation is going todefinitely change for the better,&quot; he predicted.   But Mr. Leavitt, the forecaster with Weather Services, puta less optimistic spin on the outlook. &quot;We're expecting tosee showers move in there, but it is less likely than weinitially thought that they will persist long enough, orsubstantially change the pattern enough, to help {thefarmers} recover,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
