German Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said 10 people were takeninto custody in West Germany last week. In Switzerland, the SwissFederal Prosecutor's Office said today a foreigner had beenarrested last Wednesday.   Rebmann said six of the 10 suspects captured in West Germanyremained in jail today, including two teachers, three engineers anda businessman.   Swiss prosecutors said they had launched a criminal probe intoactivities of the arrested foreigner, an engineer living in Zurich.The suspect was arrested on a tip from West Germany, prosecutorssaid, declining to disclose his name or nationality.   Rebmann called the arrests ``a heavy blow against the KGB,'' theKremlin's main intelligence agency.   Speaking at a news conference, he said the West German arrestsoccurred Wednesday and Thursday in police raids on 33 differentlocations. A total of 169 police carried out the raids, Rebmannsaid.   Two of the suspects _ identified only as doctors _ were freedshortly after police took them into custody, he said. Two othersuspects were freed in the following days, but the investigationagainst the four was continuing, he said.   Rebmann said three of the jailed suspects were Soviet emigres,but none were Soviet citizens.   He said the arrests marked ``an important penetration of the KGBspy network in West Germany.''   Rebmann also said a government secretary arrested March 18 onsuspicion of spying had been working for the KGB. It was the firsttime the woman, Elke Falk, was linked to the Soviets.   Ms. Falk worked in federal ministries for several years and hadaccess to secret information.   Gerhard Boeden, president of the federal Ministry for theProtection of the Constitution _ the West Germancounter-intelligence agency _ said West German intelligenceofficials had developed new ways to uncover East Bloc spies. Herefused to elaborate.   West German authorities identified 15 communist agents betweenAugust and December 1985. Some were arrested, others escaped.   Rebmann identified the six jailed suspects as 44-year-oldbusinessman Helmut Stefan Kolasch; a Colombian engineer identifiedby Rebmann only as ``Amaya;'' Peter Friesen, a 33-year-oldengineer; George Bender, 37, also an engineer; Shimon Or, a48-year-old teacher; and another teacher, Edmund Neufert, 37.   Friesen, Bender and Neufert are Soviet emigres, Rebmann said.All six suspects had been living in West Germany, he said.   Kolasch allegedly gave the KGB technological secrets aboutNATO's Tornado and Jaeger warplanes while working for firms dealingwith the aircraft, Rebmann said.   Kolasch has been working for the KGB since 1971, Rebmann said.   Rebmann said Amaya also handed over unidentified technicaldocuments, Friesen spied on West German political parties, Benderreported to the KGB about an electronics concern he worked for andNeufert spied on students while teaching Russian at the ForeignMinistry's language-training office.   Rebmann said Or ``reported (to the KGB) on his own life andwork,'' but he did not provide details.   The suspects apparently were operating individually, Rebmannsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
