After a reviewof the philosophy to be followed, an illustration of the problem in asimple superrenormalizable model is presented. To obtain a well-definedvariational approximation for this model, we propose a first-order formalismaugmented by the inclusion of redundant degrees of freedom. As an examplewe calculate a well-defined (i.e., regulator-independent) variationalapproximant to the effective potential.</TEXT></DOC>
