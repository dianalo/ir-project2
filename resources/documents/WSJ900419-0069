The bidding deadline passed at the end of March for thereserves of Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp., which USX put up for salelast October. After examining the unit's data, manyoil-industry officials predicted the auction won't show thestrong bidding of other recent oil-property sales. Theydoubted even whether the reserves, broken up into about ahalf-dozen packages, would all be sold.</LP><TEXT>   It isn't known when USX will announce results of the sale.Last year, Chairman Charles A. Corry said the sale would becompleted in the 1990 first quarter and yield $1.5 billion ormore. But yesterday, the company said it is premature to talkabout what it expects to receive or when. &quot;We're still indetailed negotiations with prospective buyers and the timingof {any transactions} is uncertain,&quot; a company spokesman saidin Pittsburgh.   Still, many oil men said they view the properties as fullyexplored and containing too many small wells to warrantpayment of top dollar. &quot;We just looked and walked,&quot; said thechief executive of one integrated oil company, echoing theattitude of a number of others. &quot;We look for acquisitionsthat have upside, or exploratory, potential and the Texas Oilandamp; Gas properties generally don't meet that criteria.&quot;   In addition, USX decided to retain for itself a vitalTexas Oil pipeline system linked to the gas reserves, whichfurther reduced bidders' interest, industry officials said.   &quot;Had this sale gone smoothly and gotten good dollars, itmight have blunted Icahn somewhat,&quot; said an acquisitionsspecialist from a midsized oil company.   Mr. Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has urged thecompany to sell all its Texas Oil properties and spin off thesteel and oil businesses into separate corporations.Shareholders are voting on the proposal at the annual meetingMay 7. Mr. Icahn declined to comment on signs the sale isn'tgoing well, other than to agree with oil experts that, &quot;TexasOil andamp; Gas makes a very attractive package with the pipeline.&quot;   If the sale doesn't look like it will live up to USX'sgoal, the company is widely expected to hold off announcementof results until after the annual meeting.   But delays in completing the auction have already raisedquestions about its progress and organization. &quot;This is thesecond or third time they've pushed this off,&quot; said FrederickLeuffer, a securities analyst with CJ Lawrence, MorganGrenfell Inc.   USX still could generate a strong result; sales prices ofmany energy properties over the past two years have exceededexpectations. However, one person familiar with the Texas Oilsale predicted only a few pieces would wind up being sold,bringing $500 million to $700 million. Others concurred.   &quot;I doubt anybody will buy the whole thing,&quot; said ArthurSmith, president of John S. Herold Inc., a Greenwich, Conn.,consulting and appraisal company. &quot;The properties don't lookas good&quot; as some others that have fetched surprisingly strongprices, he said.   In fact, USX seems to be setting the stage for adisappointing outcome. &quot;This is not a fire sale,&quot; a companyofficial told a group of institutional investors in NewOrleans just a few days after bids were due. &quot;I don't thinkyou can assume we'll sell all the packages.&quot;   Prospective bidders did express strong interest in atleast one region. &quot;Our conclusion was that thehighest-quality properties were in the Arkoma package,&quot; saidan official who headed up a bidding team at a large oilcompany. &quot;Our expectation is that's going to go for a premiumprice.&quot; Arkoma is a natural gas field in Oklahoma andArkansas that is currently one of the country's hottestdrilling areas.   But the other packages are viewed as less desirable. &quot;Thecatch on the rest of them is that they were made up of awhole bunch of low-producing wells and no concentration inany particular fields,&quot; contended an investment banker whoexamined them. The trend among large oil companies has beento sell off smaller, disparate wells to reduce operatingcosts.   In addition, many of recent sales were bonanzas partlybecause buyers thought the properties contained a lot ofundiscovered oil and gas. But Texas Oil has a reputation forwringing as much as possible from its properties. &quot;They don'thave much exploration potential attached to theseproperties,&quot; maintained an official of another company. &quot;Theytried to indicate there was some, but most of our fellowsdidn't agree.&quot;   Not selling the Texas Oil pipeline, which links many ofthe gas wells to processing facilities and then to largerpipelines, also hurt because any new owners of the wells cantransport their gas through that pipeline only. USX has &quot;sortof a monopoly in the gathering system,&quot; the investment bankersaid.   USX had hoped that by retaining the pipeline, it would beable to cash in on any upturn in the natural gas market. USXacquired Texas Oil in an exchange of stock valued at $3billion in early 1986, as the energy industry was skiddinginto a severe slump. Though oil prices have recovered, gasprices have remained low, depressing the profitability ofTexas Oil. Moreover, the acquisition doubled the number ofUSX shares outstanding.   ---   Clare Ansberry contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
