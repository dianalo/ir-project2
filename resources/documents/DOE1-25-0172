Despite some difficulties in the statisticalcoverage of some regions, the results of this essentially descriptiveapproach seem to be meaningful concerning both the nature and compositionof the gas types (associated or not) as well as the analysis of the frequencyof contaminants together with the values of the proportion of impurities.The regional analysis that concludes this study gives the general propertiesby zone and specifies the particularities.</TEXT></DOC>
