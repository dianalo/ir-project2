Ashland cited extraordinary gains from its sale of an interest in Melamine Chemicals Inc. and from the restructuring of employee benefit plans, for its net of $66 million, or $2.22 a share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.    A year earlier, the Ashland, Ky.-based company had earned $34 million, or $1.03 a share. Revenue for the quarter jumped 27% to $2.05 billion from $1.62 billion.    The cumulative effect of unusual fourth-quarter items added $7 million, or 24 cents a share, to profit. But Ashland's chairman and chief executive officer, John R. Hall, said he would have been pleased with the company's results even without any special credits.    &quot;Ashland Petroleum achieved $31 million in operating income, despite unsatisfactory refining margins during most of the quarter,&quot; he said. &quot;In addition, we continued to benefit from excellent results for most of our non-refining businesses.&quot;    For the year, Ashland reported net of $133 million, or $4.27 a share, down 36% from $209 million, or $6.15 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 1.7% to $6.87 billion from $6.99 billion.    As for New York-based Amerada Hess, profit before extraordinary credits fell 38% to $26.1 million, or 31 cents a share, from $41.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Extraordinary credits of $12.5 million, or 14 cents a share, made net for the latest quarter $38.6 million, or 45 cents a share, down from $41.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.    The oil company said third-quarter earnings from refining and marketing plunged 96% to $2.3 million, from $51.4 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, earnings from exploration and production were $49.8 million, compared with a $9.9 million loss a year earlier.    Third-quarter revenue rose 44% to $1.12 billion, from $780 million a year earlier.    Nine-month profit before extraordinary items was $185.1 million, or $2.19 a share, compared with the year-earlier net loss of $277.8 million. Extraordinary tax benefits of $124.3 million, or $1.47 a share, raised net for the latest nine months to $309.4 million, or $3.66 a share.    Nine-month earnings from refining and marketing were $176.6 million, compared with the year-earlier loss of $314.2 million. Nine-month earnings from exploration and production were $172.4 million, nearly triple the year-earlier $60.8 million.    Nine-month revenue rose 12% to $3.51 billion, from $3.14 billion a year earlier.    As for Phillips, third-quarter profit fell to $31 million, or 11 cents a share. A year earlier, Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips earned $113 million, or 47 cents a share, including a $148 million gain from restructuring a retirement plan and a $28 million gain from asset sales. The year-earlier quarter also included a $63 million writedown of oil and gas properties.Revenue in the latest quarter increased 28%, to $2.8 billion from $2.19 billion.    Phillips said strong results from its chemicals operations and higher crude oil prices contributed to net for the quarter. But, as previously reported, its Ekofisk field near Norway was shut down for most of August while the platform was elevated, reducing Phillips's production and increasing its cost of getting oil and gas out of the ground.    For the nine months of 1987, Phillips said its crude oil and natural gas liquids production were both down 11%, and its gas production declined 5%.    Phillips's nine-months' net fell to $2 million from $217 million, or 86 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. In the latest quarter, the company's preferred dividend requirements exceeded net income.    The year-earlier nine months included a $148 million gain from restructuring a retirement plan and a $131 million gain from asset sales, as well as a $54 million charge for a work-force reduction program and a $63 million write-down of oil and gas properties.    Revenue for the nine months increased about 5% to $7.99 billion from $7.64 billion last year. </TEXT></DOC>
