Befitting hisstar status, he entered the interview tent each day to find his table alreadyswamped with reporters and television cameramen. And befitting his role ofelder statesman, he strode in each day wearing a straw chapeau.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HE'S FADING, BUT NOT INTO THE BACKGROUNDTAYLOR, STILL ON STRONG FOOTING, ACKNOWLEDGESLOSING A STEP  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     'I'm not 22 anymore';  &quot;Everybody expects me to play like I'm 22,&quot; L.T.said. &quot;I'm not 22 anymore. I am really trying to do the best I can at thisstage of my career. They may say you're not as good as so-and-so anymore but,guys, I've been a good player and played for 10 years. I'm not trying tooutplay a guy who's 24 or 25 years old who can run 4.4 or 4.5. I've had mydays like that. I'm just trying to go out respectfully.&quot;;    The New YorkGiants are trying to help him. His teammates and coaches have been quick todownplay any indication of Taylor's deterioration. Defensive coordinator BillBelichick said the Giants have acquired more talent in recent years and,subsequently, the defensive scheme is no longer structured around Taylor.;   The truth is the Giants haven't acquired a linebacker who has broken into thestarting lineup since they drafted Pepper Johnson in 1986, and they hadn'tdrafted a pass-rushing defensive end since 1987 until they took three lastspring. The linebacker unit that appears in today's Super Bowl against theBuffalo Bills will be nearly the same as the one that appeared in Super BowlXXI.;    Blending with the team;  The exception is Harry Carson, who retiredafter the '88 season and whose spot has been filled by Johnson.;    But whereTaylor was the focal point of the Denver Broncos' blocking scheme in the '87Super Bowl, he won't be today.;    &quot;There was a time when there were threeguys on you; now it's one guy and some guy helping out,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;Iaccept that. I'm not trying to be Superman. I'm happy with being Clark Kent.Even Clark Kent has some talents.&quot;;    The diminished role irritated Taylor atfirst this season. After he averaged 14.6 sacks and 90.1 tackles over the lastsix seasons, it couldn't have been easy to have 4 1/2 sacks and fewer than 30tackles at the season's midway point. A closing flourish to finish with 10 1/2sacks and 84 tackles may have made being a teacher and role model instead of amercenary and a marauder more acceptable. There was a time when Taylor wouldline up and play by his instincts while the 10 other defensive players workedas a unit. No more.;    &quot;I just try to play every game the best I can and tryto take the young players and mold them into good players,&quot; Taylor said.;   Aside from the adjustments he has had to make to fit in the Giants' scheme,Taylor said he also has had to alter his devil-may-care style.;    &quot;Can Istill run the 40 in 4.4 or 4.5, can I jump over buildings in a single bound?No, I can't do that anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;And I don't try to. I used to chaseguys from behind. Now I go take a cutoff angle. Now, I wouldn't even thinkabout jumping over anybody, because I would jump and they would . . . come upand catch me in the knees.&quot;;    If all this sounds a little bit too humble forsomeone of L.T.'s stature, rest assured he still regards himself as beingamong the league's elite linebackers. It's just that, before, there was nodebate about his being the best of the best.;    &quot;I may not be the greatestlinebacker in the league anymore,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'm still better than 90percent of them. I was a better player when I was younger, of course, but I'ma smarter player now and more of a team leader. It's not about making 90tackles or whatever. It's whether you can make plays in key situations. I canstill do that.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RIC BUCHER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tampa, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  751  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
