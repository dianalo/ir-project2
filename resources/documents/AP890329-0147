Arabs on Thursday will mark Land Day, commemorating aconfrontation in their villages in Israel's Galilee on March 30,1976, when six people were killed after the army and police openedfire on demonstrators protesting government seizure of Arab land.   This year's Land Day protest is drawing widespread concern inIsrael. Officials and newspaper editorials have warned of an effortby leaders of the 15-month uprising in the occupied territories tobring their protest into Israel itself.   Ariel Sharon, Israel's right-wing trade minister, said Wednesdaythat Israelis will not tolerate Arab violence within their country.   ``Those radicals among the Israeli Arabs must understand it willnot be possible to push the Jews endlessly to the wall,'' he said.   Last year, 30,000 Israeli Arabs marched on Land Day in supportof the Palestinian revolt. There were no major incidents insideIsrael, but four Palestinians were shot to death in clashes in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The underground Palestinian leaders have called for a generalstrike Thursday, and leaflets distributed in Gaza urge Palestiniansto ``make the land anniversary an occasion to escalate the uprisingand burn the land under the Zionists.''   The army sealed off the occupied lands for 24 hours beginning atmidnight Wednesday (5 p.m. EST), banning all Palestinian travel toand from the West Bank and Gaza. The measure was to prevent LandDay violence, a spokesman said.   He said the entire Gaza Strip was placed under curfew as of 8p.m. Wednesday (1 p.m. EST) that forced the Palestinian populationof 650,000 to stay indoors.   ``When tension rises, we have no other choice but to respondwith wide-ranging curfews,'' army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. DanShomron said. ``If necessary, the army will act very decisively.   ``I hope the residents understand ... that to think we're just astone-throw away from a Palestinian state is only an illusion.''   Thousands of extra troops were sent to the occupied lands. Inthe West Bank town of Bethlehem, hundreds of soldiers were seentaking up positions along main roads.   Also in Bethlehem, a Palestinian died when an unidentifiedobject exploded inside his house, the army said. Arab reportssuggested the man, whose name was not given, might have been makinga bomb.   In scattered stone-throwing clashes, three Palestinians werewounded by army gunfire, Arab hospital officials said. At least 412Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed since the Palestinianuprising began in December 1988.   The army said reporters would only be allowed to travel to theoccupied lands Thursday accompanied by military officials.   Inside Israel, leaders of the 810,000 Israeli Arabs also havedeclared their own general strike.   They say the main purpose is to protest unfair treatment, suchas inadequate municipal funding, but agree that Land Day protestsare also a show of support for the Palestinian rebellion.   ``We are citizens of Israel and part of the Arab Palestinianpeople. This is a form of support for their uprising,'' saidMustafa Abu Rias, municipal council head in the Galilee village ofSakhnin. ``We are acting under the symbol of support for theuprising. Two states for two people!''   Anticipating trouble, police forces have canceled all vacationsand launched a special operation to counter any Land Day problemsinside Israel.   ``We have about 5,000 men, including 4,500 police and borderpolice and 500 soldiers,'' said Police Commissioner David Krauss.``We will have sufficient forces to deal with every deviation anddisturbance.''   Last week, members of new police ``Special Patrol Units'' and100 high school students held a mock battle in the northern town ofAfula in preparation for Land Day. The students chanted slogans andthrew rocks and fake firebombs.   Arab activists made preparations, too.   Palestinian flags flew from mosque roofs and utility poles. Newpro-PLO slogans were scrawled on walls in several Galilee villages.In Kafr Kanna, three vehicles were set ablaze, and police said theysuspect Arab nationalist motives were involved.   Youths in Sakhnin, where three people died in the 1976 riots,said they have prepared ``bottles and other things'' in case policeintervene in Land Day demonstrations.</TEXT></DOC>
