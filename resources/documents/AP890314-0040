(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A one week grounding of more than 300military helicopters led to the replacement of a main rotor shaftnut on a CH-3E just two days before it crashed, killing 15servicemen, officials said today.   Officials at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base imposed a new groundingon its five remaining CH-3E helicopters Monday after ruling out theuse of controversial night-vision goggles as the cause of the crash.   Authorities, meanwhile, recovered the last of the bodies of fourAir Force Reserve crewmen and 11 Army Special Forces members fromFort Bragg, N.C., from the charred wreckage of the CH-3E ``JollyGreen Giant.''   The Vietnam-era helicopter went down in flames Sunday night 25miles northwest of Davis-Monthan, base spokesman Capt. Carlos Roquesaid. Flags flew at half-staff at the base and a temporary morguewas set up ahead of an Air Force forensic team's arrival to completeidentifications of the bodies.   ``It's like losing a family member,'' said Capt. Ginny Garvin, asquadron officer.   Investigators were trying to determine how high the helicopterwas flying and whether it made radio contact with an accompanyinghelicopter or with air traffic controllers at Davis-Monthan beforeit crashed, Roque said.   Navy Cmdr. David Thomas, a Pentagon spokesman, said early todaythat more than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicopters belonging to theAir Force, Navy and Coast Guard were grounded for a week that endedFriday to inspect a nut attaching the main rotor head to thehelicopter frame. He said he didn't know what would happen if thenut came off in flight.   Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes said the helicopter that crashedwas inspected Friday and its nut was replaced. It was flown safelythree times after that work.   Neither Thomas nor Davis-Monthan officials knew whether the newgrounding of CH-3Es at the base would apply to similar helicoptersin service elsewhere.   The crash occurred after the helicopter refueled at Davis-Monthanwhile ferrying the soldiers from Fort Huachuca, 80 miles southeastof Tucson, to a gunnery range near Gila Bend, 125 miles northwest ofTucson.   The flight crew was wearing night-vision goggles that amplify lowlight, but investigators determined the goggles were not a factor inthe accident, Roque said.   Previous helicopter crashes in which night-vision goggles havebeen suspected of being the cause were flying low-level or in closeproxmity with other aircraft, he said.   But Sunday's flight was to have been a regular, straight, levelflight, he said. The accompanying helicopter was a reasonabledistance away and wasn't involved in the crash, he added.   Critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequatelywhen there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars. TheNational Weather Service said there were high thin clouds over thearea Sunday night, with 30-mile visibility. The crash occurred aboutan hour after sunset and about two hours before the rise of aquarter-moon.   The Orange County (Calif.) Register reported Sunday that since1978, 37 of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which night goggles wereused occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices toamplify. Those crashes killed 65 soldiers, the newspaper reported.   The CH-3 series was designed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.The Air Force has 63 left in its inventory.   Four of the victims were identified as Lt. Col. Lawrence M.Rolle, 41, of Phoenix, commander of the reserve squadron andco-pilot of the helicopter; Maj. Donald D. Thomas, 42, of Tempe, thepilot; Master Sgt. Malte Breitlow, 45, and Tech. Sgt. William E.Slaven, 37, both of Tucson.   The names of the other victims were not released.   The soldiers were attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th SpecialForces group at Fort Bragg, N.C., said Army Maj. Richard Adams.Another spokesman at Fort Bragg said the soldiers had been at FortHuachuca since Wednesday and had been scheduled to leave April 9.</TEXT></DOC>
