Sources close to both companies said James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive, had a conversation with J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman and chief executive. According to those sources, the conversation, believed to have occurred late Tuesday, has set into motion new efforts by the companies to settle a dispute over the type and amount of security that Texaco should provide Pennzoil as their legal dispute drags through the courts.    Whether the renewed contact could lead to more meaningful discussions to settle the entire case wasn't clear. &quot;That is always a goal of Texaco,&quot; said an adviser to the company. &quot;The problem is getting a dialogue started.&quot;    Sources close to Pennzoil added that they didn't believe talks to settle the entire case would begin immediately. Nevertheless, Pennzoil also has repeatedly expressed willingness to attempt to reach an out-of-court settlement of the whole case.    Houston-based Pennzoil won a judgment of $11.1 billion from Texaco in late 1985, after a jury found that Texaco had improperly interfered with a binding merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co. A Texas appeals court reduced the judgment by $2 billion. With interest, the award now totals $10.3 billion.    Texaco's immediate objective in the talks is settling the security issue prior to a hearing on the issue before a state appeals court in Houston scheduled for Monday. &quot;They're not going to roll the dice in court,&quot; a source close to Texaco said of the company. By reaching an out-of-court solution on the matter, Texaco can avoid the risk of having the court impose a more costly form of security.    In addition, should the appeals court dissolve a temporary restraining order that was entered at Texaco's request Tuesday, Texaco faces the risk that Pennzoil unilaterally could begin seizing its own forms of security for the court judgment that it won in late 1985.    Under Texas law, Pennzoil is free to file liens on Texaco's assets while the case remains on appeal. In addition, Texas law permits Pennzoil to have county sheriffs take control of Texaco's assets in Pennzoil's name, unless Texaco posts a bond in the full amount of the judgment, plus interest and costs.    Texaco has said it would seek Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code should Pennzoil obtain the freedom to begin attaching assets.    Until Monday, Texaco was protected from the bond and lien rules by an injunction it obtained from U.S. District Court in New York more than a year ago. But the injunction was dissolved Monday, when the U.S. Supreme Court, on an appeal by Pennzoil, ruled that Texaco had erred by failing to first seek relief from the bond and lien rules in the Texas courts.    Should the companies fail to resolve the issue by Monday, and should the appeals court refuse to maintain its restraining order against Pennzoil, Texaco would seek an immediate hearing before the Texas Supreme Court, a Texaco attorney said yesterday. Failing to obtain protection there, the lawyer said, Texaco again would take the matter back before the U.S. Supreme Court, which already has invited a return visit. &quot;If, and when, the Texas courts render a final decision on any federal issue presented by this litigation, review may be sought in this court,&quot; the high court said.    By yesterday, Texaco's efforts to resolve the security issue had taken on the intensity of a corporate survival mission. A horde of Texaco litigators, joined by the company's highest ranking executives, had established a headquarters in Houston that one Texaco lawyer dubbed &quot;the war room.&quot; Throughout the day, they were supplied with data from another team at Texaco headquarters in White Plains, N.Y.    It was understood that Texaco had broached the idea of promising to maintain a certain net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- to assure Pennzoil that the full judgment could be collected, were it sustained on appeal. In addition, Texaco was studying &quot;negative pledges,&quot; such as a promise that it wouldn't sell certain assets.    Pennzoil repeatedly insisted that it deserves -- and will settle for nothing less than -- an arrangement securing the entire judgment amount. The company would entertain a net-worth covenant or similar pledges by Texaco, but only as part of a larger &quot;package,&quot; according to a source close to Pennzoil. This suggests Pennzoil could demand forms of security tied to specific assets, such as oil reserves.    The restraining order entered Tuesday, while preventing Pennzoil from attaching Texaco assets, also prohibits Texaco from selling or mortgaging assets until the court decides whether to suspend permanently the bond and lien rules.    But late Tuesday, Pennzoil sought even more specific safeguards, asking the court to prevent Texaco from increasing its debt by any more than $100 million, and even from declaring common-stock dividends, until the court has decided whether to establish a permanent injunction in the case. Texaco last paid its 75-cent quarterly dividend in March, indicating the next one wouldn't be paid until June. </TEXT></DOC>
