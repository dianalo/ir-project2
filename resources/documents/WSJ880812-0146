Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The world will learn all it wants to about George Bush this coming week, but the salient political insight for Republicans now gathering here can be found in Joe McGinniss's famous 1968 book about Richard Nixon's media strategy, &quot;The Selling of the President.&quot; The anti-hero adman of that book had actually broken into politics two years earlier to work for a young Texas congressional candidate by the name of George Bush.    &quot;There was a haziness about exactly where he stood politically,&quot; said the adman Harry Treleaven, explaining why he was attracted to the idea of selling Mr. Bush.    Twenty-two years later, the question Republicans are asking is how Mr. Bush will decide to lift the haziness. His lack of a clear political identity may explain, as well as anything else, his current lag in the polls. And this coming week offers his best chance to tell voters how and where he would lead the country as president. As Mr. Bush might put it, he finally has to grapple with &quot;the vision thing.&quot;    This isn't to say that George Bush -- or the Republican Party -- lacks convictions. The platform being drafted this week has a surplus of conviction, 30,000-words worth, on everything from vivisection to nuclear war. (Republicans will study the former but are against the latter.) The vice president even made his own unusual pilgrimage here Monday to stress his allegiance to a platform steeped in &quot;ideas,&quot; in contrast to the &quot;stealth&quot; candidacy of Michael Dukakis.    But the doubts about Mr. Bush are less about bedrock convictions or philosophy than whether he'll have the confidence in those convictions to make them central to his campaign. This is also the historic weakness of the Republican Party, of course. Inured since FDR to being a minority, Republicans have a hard time believing their principles could possibly persuade a popular majority. Ronald Reagan -- along with Jesse Jackson the premier &quot;conviction&quot; politician of his age -- changed that for a season, but the instinct of many Republicans is still to run for the bunkers.    And Mr. Bush has so far failed to demonstrate his confidence in a governing Republican philosophy. He has said for months, for example, that he wants to be &quot;the education president.&quot; A natural way to make this platitude more vital to voters would be to stress the principle of parental choice, including the right to choose among public schools. Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich has implemented such a program, while Gov. Dukakis vetoed a similar bill in Massachusetts. Yet in Mr. Bush's last major speech on education, the most he would say about the Perpich plan is, &quot;I'll be watching that experiment closely.&quot;    Even when he commits to an issue, Mr. Bush's caution is excruciating. It took aides weeks to persuade him to endorse a $1,000 tax credit for child care, but then in talking to reporters he stressed how the policy would help close the &quot;gender gap&quot; rather than help families. Mr. Bush personally worries about Congress's encroachment on presidential authority over the budget and foreign policy, but his last speech on the subject was in March.    Mr. Bush also insists he wants a &quot;positive civil-rights agenda&quot; to &quot;empower&quot; minorities with economic opportunity. Yet this week his campaign encouraged the White House to name a new education secretary with one overriding qualification -- that he be Hispanic. This isn't empowerment; it's pandering.    None of these issues win elections by themselves, but they illustrate both intellectual confidence and political leadership. And leadership means risking controversy -- for example, the wrath of the National Education Association by encouraging educational choice. &quot;When Bush begins to take some stances that publicly antagonize people because he says they're wrong, then he'll lose his image of indecisiveness,&quot; says Mitch Daniels, a former director of political affairs in the Reagan White House.    Mr. Bush is also fighting his political character, to be sure, because he's never been a &quot;conviction&quot; politician. In his 1987 autobiography, &quot;Looking Forward,&quot; Mr. Bush talks about politics as tactics or process, rarely as a matter of beliefs.    Even this year, Mr. Bush can still sound more like campaign manager than candidate. When Jesse Jackson talks about child care, he speaks of mothers struggling to afford milk (&quot;they work every day&quot;); George Bush says he's going to make a &quot;theme&quot; of &quot;investing in children.&quot; One ranking Republican, who personally believes Mr. Bush would make an able president, nonetheless says watching the vice president campaign reminds him of a Woody Allen movie: Mr. Bush analyzes his campaign more than he lives it.    That may be too harsh, and in fact there is some recent cause for Republican optimism. Mr. Bush has begun to lay out his vision on foreign policy -- a winning contrast with Mr. Dukakis -- and Bush advisers promise there will be more ideas to come, clustered around the notions of &quot;choice&quot; in education and health care, &quot;empowerment&quot; for the poor, and a new commitment to space.    But the decision to run on his own vision of the future -- and not simply the comfortable trap of &quot;peace and prosperity&quot; -- should start this coming week. The Democratic taunt of &quot;Where was George?&quot; won't lose its currency until Mr. Bush can more thoroughly answer, Who is George? </TEXT></DOC>
