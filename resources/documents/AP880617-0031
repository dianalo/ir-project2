On Thursday, police helicopters swirled overhead, checking thetops of skyscrapers in downtown Toronto, while about 3,000 officersand security agents prepared to protect the leaders of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and theEuropean Commission.   A Japanese diplomat in Manila said a suspected Japanese Red Armyterrorist arrested in the Philippines last week had planned toestablish a base for attacks on the Toronto summit and the Olympicsin Seoul, South Korea.   Metropolitan Toronto Police Supt. Bernard Nadeau said the reportwas being investigated.   He said Canadian immigration officers had stepped up scrutiny ofeveryone entering the country and that demonstrators of any kindwill not be allowed anywhere near the three-day meeting, whichstarts Sunday.   The first leaders will reach Toronto today. President Reaganwill be among the last to arrive on Sunday morning.   ``The biggest threat is terrorism,'' Nadeau said in aninterview. ``Historically, they've always been active at summitconferences. They have a way of getting into a country illegally.''   The reported arrest in the Philippines follows the detention ofa suspected Japanese Red Army terrorist, Yu Kikumura, 35, on theNew Jersey Turnpike in April. Police found homemade pipe bombs andfalse papers in his car.   On June 12, an 18-year-old Japanese college student, YoshioKosugi, was arrested in Philadelphia when police found a rifle andgrenades in his luggage.   Japan's radical Middle Core Faction fired five homemade rocketsduring the Tokyo summit in 1986, but the projectiles fell short oftheir target.   In a message directed at any terrorist groups contemplating anattack in Toronto, security officials this month put on ademonstration by a rapid deployment assault squad trained for thesummit. Borne by helicopters and equipped with high-powered M-16rifles, the commandos will not be seen again ``unless somethinghappens,'' Nadeau said.   Police said Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Reagan are considered the mostlikely targets, in Reagan's case possibly from Middle Eastextremists or a lone attacker such as John Hinckley, Jr., who shotand wounded the president in 1981.   Mrs. Thatcher narrowly escaped injury at a party conference inBrighton, England, on Oct. 12, 1984, when the Irish Republican Armyplanted a bomb in her hotel.   The IRA claimed responsibility for a booby-trap bomb that killedsix British soldiers in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, on Wednesday.   ``We're uncomfortable any time British royalty visits, or anyoneconnected with the British government,'' Nadeau said. ``We'realways concerned that the IRA could be active.''   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz wants terrorism on thesummit agenda, including a proposal for all countries to denyrefueling to airplane hijackers. He said the fight againstterrorism must be renewed because it appears to be on the riseagain.   Security around the leaders will be so tight that Toronto's 3.4million residents are unlikely to get a glimpse of them except ontelevision, police said. Highways will be closed as motorcades comeand go, and up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off at given times.   ``The leaders are not here to be seen by the people,'' saidNadeau. `This is a business meeting and that's the way it will betreated.''   Local businessmen have criticized Prime Minister Brian Mulroneyfor staging the summit in the heart of Canada's biggest city. Theoriginal idea, starting with the first Economic Summit atRambouillet, France, in 1975, was to allow world leaders to thrashout problems at a quiet retreat, well out of public view.   Previous North American gatherings have been at the Puerto Ricanresort of Dorado; Montebello, Quebec; and Williamsburg, Va. The1987 summit was on an island in Venice.   Mulroney reportedly chose Toronto to help boost the city's bidfor the 1996 Olympic Games and to quell resentment after thefederal government granted tax-free international banking centerstatus to Montreal and Vancouver but left out Toronto.</TEXT></DOC>
