The cohort was traced until the end of 1980, anddeath certificates were obtained for 88% of 19,396 deaths; 1694 lungcancer cases were identified. Yearly railroad job from 1959 to deathor retirement was available from the Railroad Retirement Board, and servedas an index of diesel exhaust exposure. Directly standardized rates anda proportional hazards model were used to calculate the relative riskof lung cancer based on work in a job with diesel exhaust exposure beginningin 1959. A relative risk of 1.45 (95% CI = 1.11, 1.89) for lung cancerwas obtained in the group of workers 40 to 44 yr of age in 1959, thegroup with the longest possible duration of diesel exposure. The cohortwas selected to minimize the effect of past railroad asbestos exposure,and analysis with workers with possible asbestos exposure excluded resultedin a similarly elevated risk. Workers with 20 yr or more elapsed since1959, the effective start of diesel exposure for the cohort, had thehighest relative risk. These results taken in conjunction with otherreported results support the hypothesis that occupational exposure todiesel exhaust results in a small but significantly elevated risk forlung cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
