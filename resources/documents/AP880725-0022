Leaders of the House subcommittee on environment, energy andnatural resources of the Government Operations Committee, longcritical of the department's Office of Surface Mining, made thedecision earlier this month after a discouraging report from theGeneral Accounting Office.   The GAO, Congress' research arm, said such a move ``coulddisrupt and destabilize the program for two or more years'' andwould not necessarily mean improvements.   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., the subcommittee chairman, and Rep.Bill Clinger, R-Pa., wrote other members that in light of thereport, ``we think that a transfer at this time is not the way tosolve the existing problems.''   The letter, provided last week by subcommittee aides, said nomembers had expressed disagreement with the conclusion.   ``We plan to urge that the incoming administration, whetherRepublican or Democratic, give top priority to making thefundamental changes necessary,'' Synar and Clinger said.   A year ago Synar asked GAO to investigate transferring theOffice of Surface Mining to some other agency. He first raised theidea two years ago following a subcommittee report that documenteddifficulties the office had in getting states to enforce their ownregulations and in collecting fine and penalties.   James Duffus III, GAO associate director, said in a report datedJune 9 that only one of 16 people consulted from environmentalgroups, the coal industry and state governments favored moving theoffice out of interior.   ``After 10 years of struggle to implement (the act), stabilityis needed,'' was the consensus.   The dissenter, Hope Babcock of the National Audubon Society,argued that ``moving this function would eliminate theinstitutional conflict that exists at interior between developingmineral resources and protecting the environment and would send aclear signal to the receiving agency that it should givenadditional attention'' to the mission of the office, Duffusreported.   Babcock said in the report that the Environmental ProtectionAgency should take over the regulatory role ``because of itsexperience with water pollution and runoff, water expertise andgood reputation as a regulatory agency, and experience dealing withcitizens' concerns and involvement in pollution problems.''   Another view came from former Deputy Undersecretary of InteriorSteve Quarles, now a staff member at the National Academy ofSciences, who suggested grouping all of interior's regulatoryprograms under one assistant secretary.   He said the mining industry did not believe EPA would ``providea proper balance between (the act's) stated goals of energyproduction and environmental protection.''   ``We have also reported problems in EPA's management withrespect to cleaning up hazardous waste and enforcing airstandards,'' the report said.   The GAO also said there would be a long period of adjustment toany change.   ``Substantial problems during initial periods of reorganizationare inevitable,'' such as ``delays in obtaining key agencyofficials, inadequate staffing, insufficient funding, inadequateoffice space and difficulties in establishing support functionssuch as payroll and accounting systems,'' the report said.   ``We found that solving these start-up problems resulted indelays ranging from nine to 30 months and distracted agencyofficials from concentrating on their new missions during thecritical first year of operations,'' GAO said.   Alan Cole, spokesman for the Office of Surface Mining, said,``We agree that it would be counterproductive to transfer the(office) to another agency.''</TEXT></DOC>
