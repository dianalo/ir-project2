As first president ofJapanese ancestry, Mr. Fujimori faces an almost biblical setof problems: economic collapse, violent insurrection and thenation's worst drought in memory.   Peru is falling apart, and for his effort to put ittogether again, Mr. Fujimori controls only small minoritiesin the Legislature. His popular support, which comes mostlyfrom the poor, could easily evaporate if their lot worsens.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Fujimori campaigned on a pledge to bring &quot;readjustmentwithout recession,&quot; but he already has hinted he will beforced to break his vow -- and soon -- by imposing austeritymeasures under guidelines laid down by the InternationalMonetary Fund. Peruvians have coined a phrase for theexpected moves: &quot;Fujishock.&quot;   The prospects unnerve members of Mr. Fujimori'sgovernment. Shortly after being named, his prime minister,Juan Carlos Hurtado-Miller, confessed to a reporter that hewas &quot;very scared&quot; about taking the job. Worries EstebanHnylicza, an economic adviser, &quot;The country is in such badshape, there is a big risk the country may explode.&quot;   Is Mr. Fujimori worried? He shrugs: &quot;They are justtechnical problems.&quot; The agronomist and one-timemathematician adds, &quot;And I'm a political engineer,&quot; as heescorts a visitor through the tightly guarded armed forcesofficers club, where he has been living for security reasons.   A part of Mr. Fujimori's confidence seems to stem from hismeteoric political rise. Just a few months ago, he was atotal unknown. &quot;My relatives didn't believe in me,&quot; Mr.Fujimori says. &quot;My brother said I was crazy.&quot; Only his15-year-old daughter, Keiko, thought Mr. Fujimori would makeit. She saw it in a dream.   Peru's disastrous economy is Mr. Fujimori's most immediatechallenge. In the past two years, gross national product fell22%, while real income slumped 63%. Inflation topped 1,500%in 1988 and surpassed 3,500% in the past 12 months.   The crisis has devastated an already poor country. Almost40% of Peruvians suffer from malnutrition. Two-thirds ofLima's six million-plus residents live in shantytowns, oftenin roofless cubicles with straw walls.   Lima, once the proud seat of Spanish viceroys, has becomea chaotic bazaar, its streets home to thousands of peddlersand thousands more money-changers, buying and sellingdollars. Money-changing is one of the few growth industries.   Middle-class and business districts go without water andelectricity for days at a time, the result of the drought andsabotage of electric installations by guerrillas. Thesituation is even worse in the countryside. Drought hasdestroyed half of Peru's potato, corn and barley crops. Morethan two million peasants are at risk.   Mr. Fujimori says he will take quick steps to put Peru'seconomy in order but offers few specifics. Peruviansnevertheless are bracing for drastically higher prices onnow-subsidized goods, such as bread and gasoline.   The economic crisis has aggravated Mr. Fujimori's secondheadache, the bloody 10-year war waged by Sendero Luminoso,or &quot;Shining Path,&quot; a sect-like group led by a formerphilosophy professor who may or may not be dead and whose nomde guerre is &quot;Presidente Gonzalo, the Fourth Sword ofMarxism.&quot;   &quot;The situation will get worse, and that's good forrevolutionaries,&quot; says a 60-ish Shining Path activist, auniversity professor who sits slumped in the empty lobby of aonce-elegant Lima hotel. &quot;We must destroy everything sosomething green can emerge,&quot; he says.   Shining Path now challenges the military for control ofabout half of Peru's territory. More than 18,000 people havedied in the conflict. Frustrated by its inability to defeatthe guerrillas, the army has frequently taken out its ire onthe civilian population, various human rights organizationssay. The result: murders, massacres and disappearances.   It is a war that will get worse. &quot;The country is in astate of subversion,&quot; says a Peruvian military analyst. &quot;Wecan't kill the whole indigenous population.&quot;   Mr. Fujimori says he is willing to negotiate with Sendero,but Sendero doesn't negotiate. &quot;The army will be totallydefeated,&quot; says the professor, who thinks that the crimes ofCambodia's Pol Pot and the Soviet Union's Josef Stalin havebeen exaggerated. &quot;No. Not defeated,&quot; he says, after a pause.&quot;Destroyed.&quot;   While the combustible combination of hyperinflation andterrorism is the stuff of Lima nightmares, the U.S. hasdifferent concerns about Peru. More than half the coca leafused in the world's cocaine trade is grown in Peru's AltoHuallaga valley, a jungle region near its Colombian andBrazilian borders. Washington's goal in Peru is to stop thecocaine trade.   But the Alto Huallaga is a Shining Path stronghold. Theguerrillas made great strides in the valley by defendingcoca-growing campesinos from Colombian traffickers and fromsometimes corrupt Peruvian police. Shining Path's servicesaren't free. It earns at least $1 million a month from itsprotection rackets, U.S. and Peruvian officials say.   The U.S. and Peru are negotiating a $35.9 million militaryaid package that would pay for equipment and training by U.S.advisers of about six Peruvian army battalions to be used inoperations against both drug traffickers and Shining Pathguerrillas in the Alto Huallaga.   Already, U.S. Special Forces trainers and Drug EnforcementAdministration agents are involved in training Peruvianpolice forces at two bases in the valley. At one base, SantaLucia, pistol-packing U.S. officials and Peruvian police haveset up a simulated cocaine-base production farm andlaboratory, complete with fake Shining Path guerrillasguarding fake shipments. They show it off to visitingjournalists.   Not everyone in the Peruvian military is pleased by theU.S. efforts. Gen. Alberto Arciniegas, a former militarycommander of the Alto Huallaga, opposes the drug eradicationprogram, arguing that it drives the local population into thearms of the rebels. He dismisses the demonstration center atSanta Lucia as &quot;Disneyworld.&quot;   Gen. Arciniegas, echoing the opinion of many of hiscolleagues, says the U.S. military agreement is positive, asthe Peruvian military is underequipped. But bringing inadvisers or troops would be disastrous, he says. &quot;If theAmericans come, we will be handing Sendero theanti-imperialist banner to wave.&quot;   Mr. Fujimori probably has little choice but to cooperatewith the U.S. &quot;Fujimori is in no position to demandanything,&quot; says a military analyst who advises thepresident-elect. &quot;Foreign debt negotiations and our return tothe international community depend on what the StateDepartment wants on drug trafficking.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
