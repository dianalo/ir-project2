 Thevarying 1993 projections reflect different market-research forecasts.andM;But competitors must make substantial investments of their own time and moneyto prepare for, and take part in, the systems procurement process.andP;  Acompeting integrator must anticipate agency procurement plans, understandwhat an agency is asking for in its Request for Proposals (RFP) and preparebids responsive to project requirements and appropriate federal regulations.andO;Then he must seek out partners who have complimentary skills and products andset up project demonstrations.andM;All that only gets him closer to the finish line.andP;  And even a winning bidderisn't necessarily home clear.andP;  Contract protests, especially on largersystems, are always possible, while budget cuts or policy changes enacted anytime after an award is made may require renewed negotiations, if they don'teliminate the project altogether.andP;  Yogi Berra's dictum-&quot;It's not over tillit's over&quot;-applies in spades to the federal systems market.andM;Such potential obstacles have not deterred thousands of contractors, largeand small, from trying for a piece of the federal systems action.andP;  Theplayers include independent systems housessuch as Electronic Data SystemsCorp., Computer Sciences Corp.andP;  and Planning Research Corp.-which havetraditionally catered to this market; Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.andP;  and severalother of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; professional service and consulting companies;hardware and software manufacturers like Digital Equipment Corp., IBM Corp.andO;and Oracle Corp.; and aerospace companies such as TRW Inc.andP;  and MartinMarietta Corp.andP;  Many of these companies have spun off subsidiaries dealing inwhole or part with federal projects.andM;A number of mergers and acquisitions of federal integrators over the past twoyears (particularly by telecommunications companies) also indicate widecorporate interest in entering or expanding operations in this sector.andM;Among noteworthy deals have been the acquisition of AGS Computers Inc.andP;  byNynex Corp., Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s purchase of Vanguard TechnologiesInternational Inc.andP;  and the acquisition of BDM International Corp.andP;  by FordAerospace Co.andM;Timely, accessible informationandM;The federal and commercial systems integration arenas bear certainresemblances to each other.andP;  Whether they work for General Motors Corp.andP;  orthe General Services Administration (GSA), systems integrators basicallyaccept full responsibility for selecting, purchasing and installing equipmentftom more than one vendor in an interconnected and interoperable systemintended to address specific client goals.andP;  The integrator also oftencustomizes or develops hardware and software needed to meet particularfunctions and may provide maintenance and training services as well.andM;The demand for systems integration rests on a similar set of driving forcesin each sector.andP;  In particular, government agencies, like large corporations,need timely access to mission-critical information.andP;  Often, however, suchinformation is located in widely dispersed databases that aren't easilyconsolidated and may not be available in compatible formats.andM;For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs, formerly the VeteransAdministration (VA), is continually involved in processing veterans'compensation claims for educational, home loan and medical benefits, amongothers, and in determining eligibility for admission to VA hospitals.andM;&quot;Facilitating the exchange of relevant data among different VA units is vitalin providing the care and benefits veterans need at a reasonable cost and ina timelymanner,&quot; says Richard Brooks, director of the policy standards andintegration service at the department.andP;  &quot;We anticipate that decentralizedprocessing technology will be important in helping us do this.&quot;andM;At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), officials must obtain a widevariety of documents needed to establish the identity and liability ofprivate companies responsible for pollution at hazardous waste sites.andP;  Thegovernment is entitled to compensation ftom such companies for site clean-upscontracted for by the EPA.andP;  Assembling the documents required to justifyrecovery costs is a complex job since more than one company may be involvedat a given site.andP;  Billing and technical data may be spread among EPA'sregional offices, main accounting office, contracts payment center and labs.andM;&quot;Storing, managing and physically assembling the documents we need is oftennot easy or efficient,&quot; says Ed Hanley, EPA's director of informationresources management, &quot;especially when not all the information on a documentis required for a particular case.&quot; For these reasons, the EPA has issued abid for an optical disk-based imageprocessing system to be used on a projectknown as the Superfund Transactions Automated Retrieval System.andP;  Thisimage-processing system will help the EPA with its records-managementproblem.andM;Upgrading technologyandM;The need to upgrade aging computer systems at many agencies is anothermotivating factor in the federal market, as it can be in the commercialsector.andM;The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), for instance, has a serious needto modernize and improve existing air traffic control systems, according toMike Perie, deputy director of the agency's Automation Service.andP;  &quot;With airtraffic increasing faster than anticipated since deregulation, we have faceda flat computer horsepower shortage in some facilities.andP;  Moreover, a lot ofour software was developed in the 1960s, so it's not easy to add newfunctions.&quot; The FAA intends to remedy this situation through the NationalAirspace System Modernization Plan, which includes substantial systemsintegration.andM;Systems integration allows clients to realize the full potential ofincreasingly powerful computer technology, believes Milt Cooper, group vicepresident for program development at Computer Sciences.andP;  He cites imagingtechnology that allows cost-effective storage of massive quantities ofinformation, dramatic advances in the power of desktop machines and third-andfourthgeneration software languages that allow the government to put togetherand manage huge databases in ways not previously possible.andP;  Add to this theavailability of LAN connectivity at megabit speeds, and the stage is set forgrowing agency interest in systems integration.andM;Cooper also points to an important organizational shift.andP;  &quot;In the early1980s, the government formalized the information-resource-managementstructure in central managing units within each agency.andP;  That has allowedagency-wide views of data processing and communications needs which,consequently, influenced the rise of large, interconnected computingsystems.&quot;andM;In addition, federal agencies often hire outside systems integrators for oneof the prime reasons private companies do: &quot;Turning to an external integratoris a sensible way for an agency to preserve its funds and staff forfulfilling its basic mission,&quot; says Robert Laurence, president of OracleComplex Systems Corp.andP;  &quot;It makes sense for the staff to contract-out systemswork so it can focus on what it does best.andP;  The main purpose of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, for example, isn't to put togethersome of the world's largest databases.&quot;andM;The federal and commercial arenas may share core concepts and technologies,but certain aspects of the environment in which systems integration takesplace are quite dissimilar.andP;  Not only are the size and complexity ofgovernment projects generally larger than those in the private sector, butthe process by which awards are made and the time and expense needed toparticipate tends to be significantly different.andM;The federal marketplace is a public arena, resting on public funds.andP;  As aresult, doing business with the government is like operating in a fishbowl.andM;A variety of publicly available sources exist.andP;  They include the CommerceBusiness Daily, for information on RFPs.andP;  The annual Five Year Plan forMeeting the Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunications Needs of theFederal Government, published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ofthe Executive Office of the President, contains data on informationtechnology budgets, acquisition plans and specific initiatives ftom theagencies.andM;Thus, &quot;If you spend the time and money, you can get a pretty good idea ofwhat the government specifically intends to purchase,&quot; says Graham Kemp,president of G2 Research Inc., Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;You can see where yourproducts match potential government RFPs, prepare yourself selectively andproduce bids for what you have to offer.andP;  No such process exists in thecommercial arena.&quot;andM;Another important consequence of doing business in the public sector is theregulatory environment that surrounds federal procurement processes.andP;  Thethrust of many such regulations is to ensure that procurement is carried outon the basis of &quot;full and open competition,&quot; as required by the Competitionin Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984.andP;  According to Jim Kurz, of the law firm ofKurz and Koch, Washington, D.C., many contracts were awarded on a solesourcebasis before this legislation was enacted.andP;  &quot;Somebody outside the fraternitymight not have been able to play the game at all,&quot; says Kurz.andM;Now, however, RFPs are not only publicly advertised, they must be open toanybody who can meet the requirements.andP;  &quot;We have to be demonstrably fair,&quot;says Frank McDonough, deputy commissioner of GSA's Office of InformationResources Management Service.andP;  &quot;As a matter of principle, any company has aright to be considered for a contract.andP;  A private business can decide toaward contracts, say, only to Digital or IBM, but we have to let anyboby havea shot at it and prove we did it that way.andP;  That might make us inefficient byone set of measures, but it's good public policy.&quot;andM;McDonough feels that the potential benefits of open procurements includeincreasing the challenge to established players, better prices for thegovernment and a stronger technology base for the country.andM;In carrying out such a policy, both agencies and bidders, as appropriate, aresubject to a cross-referenced regulatory framework established by the FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Federal Information Resource ManagementRegulations (FIRMR).andP;  Each agency may also have its own supplementary rules.andO;In general, these regulations spell out requirements for projectdocumentation, accountability, acquisitions and standards of conduct.andM;That isn't all.andP;  The contractor community is also affected by numerous otherstatutory-based or policy requirements stemming from foreign tradeagreements, national security considerations and mandates that set aside aproportion of government procurements for small businesses and businessesowned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.andM;Given this ftamework, agencies attempt to write their interpretations ofrequirements in great detail, according to Don Dall, partner-in-charge of theFederal Systems Integration Group at Andersen Consulting's Chicago office.andO;&quot;On the commercial side, it's much easier to handle this,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Younegotiate requirements based on what the customer says he wants.andP;  On thefederal side, fairness is the key word in the process.andM;The government's rules are intended to create a level playing field forcompetitors, concludes Daniel M.andP;  Jacobs, president of The Federal MarketGroup, a Vienna, Va.andP;  consultancy.andP;  &quot;However necessary this may be, thecumulative impact of such rules further increases the complexity ofparticipating in the federal systems market, slows up the procurementprocess, raises opportunity costs for potential bidders and, in general,makes for a much more structured environment than that found in the privatesector.&quot;andM;Procurement IntegrityandM;The most recent example of conditions set for ethical behavior by agenciesand contractors involved in government procurements is the Office of FederalProcurement Policy Act Amendments of 1988.andM;The regulations reflect publicity surrounding procurement scandals that wereunder investigation last year.andP;  Among other things, competing contractors andgovernment officials ore forbidden during the course of a procurement todiscuss post-government employment and to offer or invite gratuities.andP;  Normay they solicit or disclose proprietary or source-selection information,other than as authorized.andM;The regulations also entail certification by officials and contractors thatthey aren't engaged in illegal practices.andP;  And they impose new restrictionson post-government employment of officials who have been personally andsubstantially involved in procurements.andM;&quot;The problem with some of these regulations is their ambiguity, theapprehension they raise among contractors about employing capable people andthe impact that they may have on further drawing out the procurementprocess,&quot; says Daniel M.andP;  Jacobs, president of The Federal Market Group ofVienna, Va.andP;  &quot;It may be too easy to stumble into an inadvertent violation ofthe non-disclosure or post-employment rules, for example.&quot;andM;Lawyers contend that the certification requirement is a liability that'salmost unknown, according to Carl Kelly, vice president and general managerof Planning Research Corp.'s Systems Integration Division.andP;  &quot;You are not justcertifying compliance with the rules to your best knowledge.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
