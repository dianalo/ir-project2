The model space of /sup 44/Tiare constructed by using these ''pairs.'' In the calculations the experimentalenergies of these ''pairs'' are taken as the zero energies of the spectraof /sup 44/Ti. The results show that the calculated spectra are in quitegood agreement with experimental values.</TEXT></DOC>
