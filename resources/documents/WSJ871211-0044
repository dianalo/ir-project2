The Army intends for soldiers to use the devices, called compact radio direction finders, to spot such signal-emitting targets as tanks and artillery batteries. The unit of Cleveland-based TRW also will have to develop facilities and procedures for training troops how to use the system.    The Army sought bids from 62 possible suppliers, but only two firms besides ESL submitted proposals. The contract will be supervised by the Army's Electronic Support Activity unit in Bent Hill, Va.    Separately, McDonnell Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., received a $240 million contract to deliver F-18 Hornet fighterbombers to the Navy.    Treadwell Corp. received a $10.4 million Navy contract for oxygen generators for submarines.    (Revised WSJ Dec. 15, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
