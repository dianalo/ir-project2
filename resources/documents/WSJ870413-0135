I concur and would add that benefits to imaging will go far beyond medical applications.    There are hundreds of companies, the majority small, addressing electronic-imaging (EI) markets with systems based on digital image processing, computer-generated imaging and other electronic-based technologies. These systems are capturing, processing, displaying and transmitting the most data-dense form of information: images.    Digital image processing is the cornerstone technology for systems that take light (or other wave forms) emanating from real-world scenes and structure and convert those signals into digital electronic pulses for computer processing. Such systems are revolutionizing factory automation (robot guidance, automated inspection), security (access control), law enforcement (fingerprint matching), printing and publishing (desktop publishing and electronic printing), graphic arts (digital prepress), remote sensing (resource analysis) and product design (motion analysis), among others.    Imaging systems are getting faster, smaller and cheaper as the component technologies advance. Four-megabyte memory chips, optical and thin-film storage, sub-one-micron microprocessors, optical-fiber transmission and other technologies are pushing the frontiers of EI.    For the most part, systems addressing EI markets break an image down to an ultralong string of numbers represented by a series of on/off states determined by presence or absence of an electron. The potential importance of frictionless carriers of electrons -- superconductors -- is hard to overstate. Yes, medical imaging will benefit, as will roughly 20 other markets and some hundred imaging applications.    Richard D. Schwarz   First Vice President   Equity Research Dept.   E.F.
