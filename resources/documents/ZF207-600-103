 But no matter how deep the pockets and how large the disk ofa desktop publisher, the range of typefaces and designs available on the PCcan't match the variety available to a well-equipped print shop.andP;  Nor can the300-dot-per-inch printers on our desktops match the sharp lines and smoothcurves available with traditional type cast from hot metal or with 2,540-dpicomputerized typesetting machines.andM;Although PC-based laser printing hasn't quite caught up to the heirs ofGutenberg, the large variety of fonts and font  utilities available for theHewlett-Packard LaserJet and its compatibles--and the narrower rangeavailable for PostScript printers--shows that the PC has indeed come a longway.andP;  Now PC Magazine examines the different categories of PC-based fontproducts--and the different ways to use and manage all those typefaces.andM;BITMAPS FOR BEGINNERSandM;All laser printers work by placing small black dots on a white page.andP;  Toprint the letter A the printer has to be told where to place the dots for thepointed top of the letter, then where to place the dots that create thediagonal and horizontal lines below it.andM;The printer needs a map that tells it where to place each dot, and that mapis called a bitmap.andP;  It resembles a piece of graph paper in which somesquares are filled in and some left blank.andP;  The pattern of squarescorresponds to the pattern of dots that make up each individual character.andO;In a computer or printer the bitmap is represented by a sequence of binarydigits.andP;  A 1 indicates that a dot should occupy that position on the map; a 0means that the position should be left blank.andM;In the terminology used for computer printing, a font is a set of bitmapsthat constitutes an alphabet of characters of a certain point size.andO;Ten-point Times Roman is one font; 10-point Times Roman Italic is another,12-point Times Roman is a third, and so on.andM;With few exceptions, fonts for the HP LaserJet consist of sets of bitmapsstored in one of three places: the ROM built into the printer itself; the ROMin a cartridge that you can plug into the printer and remove; and soft fontfiles that are stored on your hard disk, and that you can transfer, ordownload, temporarily to the RAM of the printer.andM;In the centuries of hot metal type, designing a font was an art.andP;  In the ageof the 300-dpi laser printer, art must be combined with science.andP;  Whencreating a bitmap font for a laser printer, it isn't enough simply to take apiece of graph paper on which each square represents a 1/300-inch dot, thendraw the outline of each character on the graph and darken each square thatfits within the outline.andP;  Any slanted or curved line will cut across somesquares, forcing you to decide which squares to darken and which ones toleave blank.andP;  The decision is much harder than it seems.andM;Intuition suggests that the best way to approximate a slanted line on acoarse bitmap is to darken the dots that will create a reegular &quot;flight ofsteps&quot; corresponding to the slant.andP;  But research on visual perception showsthat intuition is wrong.andP;  The eye doesn't translate those flights of stepsinto a smooth line.andP;  However, the eye will interpret some highly complexpatterns of protuberances and indentations as a smooth line, and only themost expert font designers know how to draw those patterns.andP;  If you take afont editor and compare two italic LaserJet fonts, you'll find that thesmoother-looking font actually has some edges that look like an exoticsawtooth pattern when enlarged by a factor of 100 or more.andM;PICKING A CHARACTER SETandM;The group of characters that make up a font is called its symbol set orcharacter set.andP;  The minimal character set for most fonts is the USASCII(low-order) set, which consists of the letters, numbers, and other symbolsthat you would find on a standard computer keyboard.andP;  The Legal setsubstitutes characters like the Registered, trademark, or copyright symbolsfor little-used keyboard characters.andP;  Both of these sets have 96 characters.andM;Fonts with extended character sets have 192 to 256 characters.andP;  The mostcommon is Hewlett-Packard's Roman-8 set, which includes the characters neededfor most European languages.andP;  Microsoft Windows, Ventura Publisher, andPostScript each have their own extended symbol sets.andP;  Always buy fonts withextended characters, even if you don't think you'll ever need them.andP;  Somedayyou'll have an important client or customer with a name like Godel orGarconne, and she'll be very unhappy if you can't spell her name.andM;HARD FONTS, SOFT FONTSandM;Built-in fonts and cartridge fonts are the most convenient kind to use.andP;  Aslong as your software can give the commands that tell your printer to use acertain font, you never have to think about these &quot;hard&quot; fonts.andP;  Soft fontsare trickier to deal with.andP;  They disappear from the printer's memory everytime you switch it off, and you or your applications have to remember todownload them before you try to use them for printing.andM;Another inconvenience with soft fonts is the amount of space they take onyour disk.andP;  A 10-point font with only the standard keyboard characters needsabout 10K of disk space.andP;  But a large headline font can require a few hundredkilobytes.andP;  A full collection of LaserJet fonts can easily overwhelm a smallhard disk and take up quite a bit of space on a large one.andM;If you need to choose among dozens of different fonts, you might find thestored bitmap approach used by the LaserJet to be cumbersome.andP;  PostScriptprinters, on the other hand, don't normally use stored bitmaps.andP;  When anapplication tells a PostScript printer to print some text in 15-pointHelvetica, the printer constructs the necessary bitmap in its own memory.andP;  Todo this, it consults a &quot;typeface outline&quot; that contains data on theshape--but not the size--of each character.andP;  These typeface outlines arestored either in the printer's ROM or in a file on-disk.andM;The typeface outline is a coded representation of the imaginary and idealfrom of the character, rather than one you can actually see or print.andP;  ThePostScript interpreter in the printer converts that ideal into bitmaps thatattempt to represent the ideal at the size requested.andM;In the real world of 300-dpi laser printing, the PostScript bitmaps can'tequal the quality of a LaserJet bitmap that someone has brought into a fonteditor and tuned for the best possible appearance.andP;  And PostScript laserprinters are slower to print text than LaserJets, because they have toconstruct the fond before printing.andP;  The LaserJet simply lays down dotsaccording to the bitmap already in its memory.andP;  But PostScript printers giveyou an infinite variety of sizes, without making you store separate bitmapsfor every size you need.andM;BEATING THE JAGGIESandM;At 300 dpi, type looks ragged--especially when it is printed in a large pointsize.andP;  A diagonal line tends to look like a flight of steps.andP;  A curved linechanges its thickness and has odd angularities that don't belong there.andP;  Anupgrade to 400 dpi, as in the PostScript printer that will come with the NeXTcomputer, doesn't make a spectacular difference, but when 600 dpi arrives onyour desktop perhaps a few years from now, it will begin to approachtypographic quality.andP;  Twelve hundred-dpi printing on desktops won't arrive inthe foreseeable future, and the 2,540-dpi resolution of this magazine is moredistant still.andM;Meanwhile, some expensive add-ins for the HP LaserJet Series II bring 600- by300-dpi printing to today's desktop.andP;  The $3,995 LaserMaster LX6 Professionalcontroller card is the best of these.andP;  With drivers for Microsoft Windows andVentura Publisher, plus support for WordPerfect and Microsoft Word on theway, it gives you the sharpest and clearest type you can print on a desk.andP;  Ituses scalable type comparable with PostScript's, so its fonts don't wastespace on your disk.andM;A STREAM OF FONTSandM;The original LaserJet could use only its own built-in fonts and fonts storedin cartridges.andP;  Its successor, the LaserJet Plus, was the first model thataccepted soft fonts.andP;  At first, the only soft fonts you could get were theones that vendors decided to sell you.andP;  If a vendor didn't offer a 25-pointTimes Roman, the LaserJet user was out of luck.andM;Then Bitstream introduced its Fontware font-generator program, which broughtsome of the flexibility of PostScript to the LaserJet.andP;  Fontware worked withtypeface outlines similar to those used by PostScript printers.andP;  You selectedthe size you needed, and Fontware generated a bitmap, which it then storedon-disk.andP;  You could use these soft fonts in exactly the same way you usedstore-bought soft fonts.andM;Other font generators followed in Fontware's footsteps.andP;  Among the mostinteresting and impressive is the latest version of SWFTE's Glyphix, whichworks as a kind of PostScript for the LaserJet printer.andP;  When you print afile, Glyphix can generate the bitmaps that you need and then send themdirectly to the LaserJet.andM;Some applications know all about using soft fonts in printing; others hardlyknow they exist.andP;  Some word processors now let you use soft fonts as easilyas you use any other font.andP;  Lotus's Manuscript and MicroPro's WordStar,Release 5, come with utilities that can read the LaserJet or softfont filesor PostScript typeface-outline files on your disk and extract all theinformation they need for printing.andM;Other programs need more help.andP;  You can buy third-party utilities that letWordPerfect, Microsoft Word, XyWrite, Nota Bene, Ventura Publisher, andMicrosoft Windows applications like PageMaker use any LaserJet soft font youown.andP;  All of these applications besides XyWhite are now clever enough toautomatically download any soft font required by a document.andP;  You no longerhave to set up download utilities and batch files to download fonts inadvance--although you can usually save time by doing so.andM;BEYOND COURIERandM;For many users, Courier is enough.andP;  Thousands of LaserJets give loyal serviceas the equivalents of fast, silent Selectric typewriters.andP;  But the laserprinter makes it possible to use proportional-spaced fonts for greaterlegibility and elegance, and there's no reason to restrict yourself totypewriter fonts.andP;  For letters, reports, and some desktop publishing, theTimes Roman and Helvetica fonts in standard font cartridges are generallyenough.andP;  Other cartridges include fonts for presentations, for math andtechnical writing, for printing large spreadsheets on a single page, and forcreating forms.andP;  You can get enormous variety out of the LaserJet withoutever thinking about soft fonts.andM;But for almost anything unusual, elegant, or eye-catching, the only choice isa soft font.andP;  With soft fonts, you have access to more than 250 differenttypefaces in any size from a tiny 3 points to the height of the page.andP;  Youcan buy prepared soft fonts in the sizes and symbol sets chosen by thesoft-font vendor, but if you want exactly the font you need, and not anapproximation, you're better off using a font-generator and buying thetypeface outlines that work with it.andM;With the best font generators you can create fonts with the size, slant,darkness, and characters that you specify.andP;  This means that you can use yourcomputer to print pages that reflect your own personal or corporate identityin ways that no other program allows.andM;THE HIGH COST OF FONTSandM;One thing fonts won't save you is money.andP;  Fonts are expensive, and there's nosign of their getting any cheaper.andP;  One reason for their high cost is thehigh cost of licensing fees.andP;  The best soft fonts are licensed versions ofdesigns made by the large type houses like International Typeface corp. (ITC)and Linotype.andP;  But another reason for the high cost of fonts seems to be thatthe vendors charge what the market will bear, and the font market is booming.andM;What happens to your expensive fonts when the next generation of printersarrives?andP;  Your bitmap fonts will be worthless, whether they're in cartridgesor disk files.andP;  Font generators can be updated to create 600-dpi bitmap softfonts, but these will need four times the disk space needed by 300-dpi fonts.andO;The next generation of printers will use scalable type exclusively.andO;PostScript is one technology that will still be in use when 600-dpi desktopprinting arrives.andP;  But Hewlett-Packard, working with Agfa Compugraphic, isdeveloping a rival technology, and Microsoft and IBM have begun mutteringabout alternative technologies linked to Presentation Manager.andM;Meanwhile, even at 300 dpi, you can perform some considerable feats with alaser printer.andP;  Even Gutenberg might be impressed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
