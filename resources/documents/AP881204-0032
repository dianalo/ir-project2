Peres also noted in a radio interview that Israel agreed to thespeedy return of the hijackers to the Soviet Union Saturday afterreceiving written assurances they wouldn't face the death penalty.   ``The Soviets promised us in writing that these people wouldn'tbe executed and so there was no point in delaying or complicatingthe process,'' he said on Army radio.   The return of the hijackers ended a drama that began Thursday,when four armed Soviets seized a busload of school-children insouthern Russia, then traded them for a plane out of the country anda $3.3 million ransom. The hijackers surrendered shortly afterarriving in Israel Friday evening.   Peres cited the reaction of Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze, who personally thanked the chief of an Israeliconsular delegation in Moscow, Aryeh Levine, for Israel's help inthe affair.   Shevardnadze was the highest ranking Soviet official to meetLevine since the Israeli delegates arrived in Moscow in July.   Shevardnadze was quoted by Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Lielas expressing to Levine ``the thanks and deep appreciation of theSoviet government and Soviet people regarding the noble way thegovernment of Israel has dealt with this barbaric act.''   Peres said Shevardnadze's gesture was ``almost without precedentin our relations with the Soviet Union in recent years. I want tohope this has a significance beyond the event of the day.''   ``The representations in Israel and Moscow now have a newsignificance,'' Peres said. He referred to the Israeli delegation inMoscow and a Soviet consular delegation that has been in Tel Avivsince July 1987.   Levine said on the radio that in his meeting with Shevardnadze,he told the Soviet leader ``we would be very happy to have more orless normal relations. Normal is a very acceptable term in theSoviet Union and I took advantage of this opportunity to use it.''   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the1967 Middle East War, but has gradually warmed relations over thelast two years, with the exchange of consular delegations and aliberalization of Jewish emigration permits.   Israeli newspapers also echoed Peres' hopes that the weekendhijacking drama, which involved unusual diplomatic exchanges betweenthe Israeli and Soviet governments, would improve ties with Moscow.   The daily Haaretz ran a front-page analysis entitled: ``The PlaneFell Like a Blessing From Heaven.'' An analysis in the dailyHadashot was headlined: ``Israel Scores Many Points at a Low Price.''   Eitan Golan, who headed the Israeli police team that questionedthe hijackers, said one of them, whom he did not identify,threatened to commit suicide if he was returned to the Soviet Union.   Golan also quoted the hijackers as saying they chose Israel forasylum because they knew Israel and the Soviet Union lackeddiplomatic ties and they counted on the fact that Israel would nothand them over.   Golan said the hijackers seemed nervous but cooperated fully withinvestigators.   ``My impression is that this wasn't the most sophisticated groupin the world,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
