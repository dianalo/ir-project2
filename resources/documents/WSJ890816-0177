In a news conference a day before the scheduled beginning of a two-week vacation in Maine, Mr. Bush also backed comments by Budget Director Richard Darman last weekend that the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates too high.    &quot;I thought what Dick Darman said was very balanced. . . . I can feel very comfortable with his sallying forth and saying that,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;And I think I've said essentially the same thing in the past.&quot; All U.S. presidents have wanted low interest rates, he said, &quot;It's the American way.&quot;    Discussing the Fed in a television interview Sunday, Mr. Darman said, &quot;If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they erred on the side of caution.&quot; But the president parried the question of whether the Fed should be specifically blamed for a future recession, saying jokingly that he didn't recall that part of Mr. Darman's interview and telling reporters he would take the question &quot;under advisement and let you know at a later date.&quot; The Fed had no comment on the president's remarks.    On other topics, Mr. Bush said &quot;there are some hints that possibly there will be a transfer&quot; of power in Panama, even though dictator Manuel Noriega's designated candidate is expected to be inaugurated as president next month. The U.S. and other nations charge that the election was rigged and say a rival candidate actually was the winner. Mr. Bush didn't offer any specific reasons to expect a change, however, and he said: &quot;I'm not holding my breath on his {Gen. Noriega's} voluntary departure.&quot;    Mr. Bush also suggested that the administration would still seek to have Gen. Noriega, who has been indicted by the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, brought to trial. &quot;I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,&quot; he said.    The president also said some other federal programs will have to be cut to pay for his program against drug abuse, which is scheduled to be unveiled Sept. 5. He refused to say which programs he will propose sacrificing.    On the hostages, Mr. Bush has said previously that he believes Iran has been involved in terrorism, but he has avoided assigning Tehran specific responsibility for the 16 Westerners believed to be held in Lebanon. He has preferred instead to invite Iran's participation in efforts to win their release; for example, he said in his inaugural address that &quot;good will&quot; by Iran &quot;begets good will.&quot;    But despite a series of recent hints that Iran and Shiite Moslem leaders in Lebanon might be willing to help free the hostages, Mr. Bush said he couldn't say whether the captives are closer to being released.    Mr. Bush said he hasn't ordered military retaliation for the death of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins -- who was apparently murdered after being kidnapped from a U.N. peacekeeping detail in Lebanon -- because he lacks complete information and doesn't want to harm innocent people.    &quot;If I could find some action -- diplomatic, military, private sector, public sector -- that I thought would help get the hostages out or guard against future hostage-taking, I would take such action,&quot; he said. &quot;Military action -- I'd like to know that what action we took was not going to victimize a lot of innocent people. And I'd like to be sure of all the facts before taking action on the Higgins case. And I wish I could tell you we had all the facts, and we don't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
