Mandela received the presents during the airport welcomingceremony. He was scheduled to address a rally on Sunday.   Mandela, 71, said he had fond memories of hunting animals andswimming in rivers as a boy growing up in the village of Qunu,which he will visit during his six-day stay in Transkei.   Mandela is the son of a chief of the royal Tembu clan of theXhosa tribe. His father was adviser to the paramount chief andMandela was raised as an aristocrat.   He fled the homeland to avoid an arranged marriage, and becameinvolved in politics in Johannesburg.   Mandela, who was freed on Feb. 11 after spending more than 27years in prison for subversion against the white-minoritygovernment, had not been to his homeland for 30 years. But inprison, he had many meetings with his relatives.   He kept in contact with his cousin, Kaiser Matanzima, who becameTranskei's first prime minister in 1976. Matanzima and his brother,George, lost their power in a series of coups in 1987 whichresulted in a military government run by Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa,the army commander.   South Africa has 10 tribal homelands, four of them designated asindependent. The ANC and some other black organizations oppose thehomeland system because it deprives the 28-million black majorityof voting, residence, work and land ownership rights in the 87percent of South Africa that is designated for 5 million whites.   No foreign countries recognize the homelands as independentstates.   Mandela's first wife, Evelyn Mase Mandela, his son from thatmarriage, Makgatho, and several grandchildren, live in Transkei.   During the visit, Mandela plans to visit the graves of sevenrelatives who died during his imprisonment.</TEXT></DOC>
