The earth-sensing satellites were due to be turned off March 31,when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would runout of money to keep them going.   NOAA needed $9.4 million to operate the satellites until thefiscal year ends on Sept. 30.   But emergency funding will come from departments that use Landsatimages _ State, Defense, Agriculture and Commerce _ as well as theOffice of Management and Budget, said Quayle spokesman DavidBeckwith. Landsats scan the Earth with seven kinds of instruments,giving detailed images of the land and vegetation.   Beckwith said a review is being made of the satellite system.   ``The plug won't be pulled before the review is completed,''Beckwith said. ``The review will be completed prior to(congressional) oversight of the FY 1990 NASA budget.''   A House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee was conductinga hearing this afternoon on the Landsat.   Quayle is the new chairman of the National Space Council, whichstudies the national space programs.   Beckwith said he did not know how much money would be necessaryto keep the system operating until the end of the fiscal year, but``it could be less (than $9.4 million) if we can implement some costeconomies.''   The Reagan administration proposed no money for the current andfuture fiscal years, but Congress restored enough to keep thesatellites operating until the end of the month.   The Earth Observation Satellite Company, known as EOSAT,currently operates two satellites, Landsats 4 and 5, which providephotos for mineral exploration, checking soil conditions andvegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes andtracing ocean currents. Both satellites are well past their expectedlifetimes and are not fully operational, but they are providinguseful information.   An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction. Thatproject will continue because money was provided to complete andlaunch that satellite.</TEXT></DOC>
