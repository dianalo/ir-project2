The right to vote is taken for granted _ and often ignored _ incountries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people.   But in Eastern Europe, brutalized by 50 years of war, Stalinism,police repression, false propaganda and economic mismanagement, thatsimple act in the Polish national elections June 4 seemed nothingshort of a miracle.   Communist rule came to Eastern Europe as the result of the WorldWar II military might of the Soviet Union, but perestroika andglasnost under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are givingcountries that used to be referred to as ``satellites'' the leewayto experiment with democracy.   Economic pressures are also helping the cause of politicalreforms.   With communist economies proven unable to compete with the Westin a high-technology age, the ideological rationale forMarxism-Leninism _ that it makes life better for the common man andwoman _ has been stripped away.   In the course of one or two years, the concept of freecompetition among different political parties has gone from being anunimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in Polandand Hungary.   Poles and Hungarians will even get a rare, firsthand look at theleader of a Western democracy this month, when President Bush stopsto visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies inParis.   Bush will find a Poland that has just held the first democraticparliamentary elections since World War II, in which candidatesbacked by the Solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats.   The elections to the Sejm were not free; the opposition wasallowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats. Solidarity took all161 of those. Its platform: Remove the party's ``leading role'' andhold free elections in four years.   In Hungary, that might be too slow. A commission is working todraft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multipartyelections as early as next year. It also will guarantee free speech,independent courts and other human rights.   The rapid pace of democratic change in Hungary was underlined bythe reburial with honors June 16 of Imre Nagy, leader of the 1956anti-Soviet revolt, who was executed for treason. Hundreds ofthousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined aveteran of 1956 in swearing: ``We will never again be slaves.''   Party leaders in Poland and Hungary have been quoted as sayingthey hope the Communist Party will win planned free elections in thefuture, but if not, the party will accept the voters' verdict andrelinquish power.   In Poland, the opposition is led by Lech Walesa and theSolidarity movement which embraces workers, intellectuals and muchof the powerful Roman Catholic Church. In Hungary, reform is mainlythe work of intellectuals, including a potent liberal wing of thecommunist party itself.   Both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation oflong-banned political parties and associations, as if they only werein suspended animation for the past half century. There also aretotally new political grouping, such as environmentally conscious``Greens.''   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, democratization is not so advanced,where it exists at all. What is happening in Poland and Hungary hasraised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly agingleaderships.   East Germany and Romania, the most hardline states, havecommented with dismay on Hungary's move toward democracy. ``Underthe flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive forremoving socialism,'' said East German Politburo member JoachimHerrman. Romania said the ceremonies to honor Nagy were ``clearlyfascist, anti-socialist in nature.''   Both countries brook no dissent. In Romania, dissidents arejailed while in East Germany they are likely to find themselvesdeported to the West.   In Prague, the Czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lipservice to the Kremlin reforms, but failed so far to implement themamid an ongoing, if secretive debate about whether change is needed.   In Bulgaria, leader Todor Zhivkov remains true to a lifetime ofskillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in Moscow. In July 1987,he embraced economic reform, exciting Bulgaria's intelligentsia andyounger technocrats.   But Zhivkov and longtime comrades on the ruling Poltiburo blockeddissent within the party last year. Dissident groups, the first seenin four decades of communist rule, are closely watched by securityforces and troublemakers are expelled.   In Yugoslavia, the communist party leadership in Slovenia, themost economically advanced of the country's six republics, hastolerated a broad degree of pluralism, while rejecting demands formultiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups. Thosecalls have been echoed by intellectuals in Croatia and Servia, thetwo largest republics, but ethnic tensions among the republics havecomplicated any broad alliance for reform.   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, however, uses authoritariantactics and insists on one-party, orthodox communist rule, puttinghim at odds with other republics _ particularly the Slovenes, whoare now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved.</TEXT><NOTE>NEXT: Life in Eastern Europe-Soviets</NOTE><NOTE>End Adv Mon AMs July 3</NOTE></DOC>
