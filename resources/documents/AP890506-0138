MARYS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police arrested 59 anti-nucleardemonstrators during a peaceful protest Saturday at a base insoutheast Georgia for submarines carrying the new Trident IImissiles.   Sponsors said 300 protesters appeared outside Kings Bay NavalSubmarine Base, making it the largest of 28 demonstrations atnuclear facilities around the country.   Pax Christi, a national Roman Catholic peace group based inErie, Pa., organized the protests to mark the anniversary of a 1983pastoral letter from U.S. Catholic bishops that opposed thedevelopment of first-strike nuclear systems.   ``We're trying to draw attention to the fact that the Tridentsubmarine ... is a major move ahead in the arms race,'' saidAuxilliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit. ``It's part of anoverall first-strike capability.''   The USS Tennessee, the first of 10 Ohio-class subs that willoperate from Kings Bay, arrived in January. Each submarine willcarry 24 Trident II missiles.   Navy Secretary William Ball III has described the new nuclearsubmarines as the most significant weapon development since thePolaris submarines were launched in 1960.   The protesters gathered to hear speeches and music beneath aclump of moss-covered oaks and pines near the base's front gatebefore marching to the base.   Those arrested, including a 79-year-old woman who carried a signthat read, ``Granny for Peace,'' were cited for trespassing andobstructing the road in front of the base, police said.   Bruce Nelson, a spokesman for the Camden County Sheriff'sDepartment, said Saturday night that two demonstrators, who gavetheir names as John and Jane Doe, were jailed on charges of refusalto give their proper name. The others were released after beinggiven warning citations, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
