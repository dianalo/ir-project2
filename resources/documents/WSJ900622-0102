He is going to sit down inthe same room with Argentina's president, Carlos Menem.   Whoops] Sorry. Don't say that word. Make it &quot;Mendez,&quot; asmany Argentines do. Or be vaguer still. &quot;El Presidente&quot; willdo. &quot;Just don't call him by his name,&quot; warns publishingexecutive Carlos Ferrando. &quot;It brings bad luck.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   And if just uttering the name is dangerous, imagine theperil of actually being in the man's presence. Ask tennisstar Gabriela Sabatini or speedboat racer Daniel Scioli, bothof whom have been touched by the supposed Menem curse. &quot;Thatman,&quot; says taxi driver Cesar Rojas, artfully avoiding theobvious trap, &quot;has bad vibes. All he has to do is gosomewhere, and terrible things happen.&quot;   In superstitious Argentina, such a man is a &quot;mufa,&quot; acursed individual, and Mr. Menem's mufa-ness, having becomelegend (and a joke), is also a political liability.   &quot;Menem's bad luck&quot; is the cover story of last week's issueof newsweekly &quot;Noticias.&quot; And Humor, the satirical biweekly,ran a cover story just before the soccer games of the WorldCup began. &quot;If we want to win,&quot; the magazine advised, &quot;heshouldn't go to the `Mundial.'&quot;   The sports-loving Mr. Menem ignored Humor's advice andflew to Italy to attend Argentina's opening match withCameroon. &quot;I know people think I'm a mufa,&quot; he told anArgentine radio station hours before the game. &quot;But, today,we'll show them it's not true. Today, this streak will end.&quot;   Famous last words. Cameroon, a 500-to-one shot, beatArgentina, the defending world champion, 1-0. Humor feltvindicated. The pro-Communist daily &quot;Sur&quot; was no morecharitable. It attributed the loss to: &quot;the Mendez effect.&quot;Argentina might have done better had Ramon Diaz been playing.But just days after Mr. Menem had publicly suggested that Mr.Diaz be included on the Argentine squad, he hurt himself andwas out of action for six weeks. Of course, once elPresidente had gone home, Argentina defeated the Soviet Unionand tied Romania, so it squeaked through to the second round,fortunately without Mr. Menem in the cheering section.   Argentina's soccer loss is but the latest in a string ofevents that have won Mr. Menem his reputation as a mufa.Updating the list of mufa-related mishaps, some of them quitetragic, has become a national pastime.   Some posited examples?   Last July, Mr. Menem played a soccer game with Argentina'snational team, following which the team failed to win a gamefor months. Sergio Batista, who sat out the game so Mr. Menemcould play, saw his $1 million contract to compete for anItalian team fall through.   Switching to tennis, Mr. Menem played a benefit game withGabriela Sabatini. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Sabatini,Argentina's No. 1 woman player, twisted her knee and wasidled for weeks.   In September, el Presidente went for a boat ride withoutboard racer Daniel Scioli. The next day Mr. Scioli lost anarm in an accident.   To take his mind off Argentina's economic woes, Mr. Menemwent to the races. In the following week, four jockeys wereinjured.   Having passed like a tornado through the sports world, Mr.Menem piloted an Argentine Pucara jet. Bad for business. Afew days later, Brazil rescinded a contract to buy 30 of theplanes.   Mr. Menem named Miguel Roig to be his economics minister.Five days later, the businessman had a heart attack and died.A few weeks later, Julio Corzo, the minister of health andsocial action and the president's closest friend, was killedin a plane crash.   Tango singer Hugo del Carril was recovering in a BuenosAires hospital from a cardiovascular illness. Mr. Menem paida visit and, two hours later, Mr. del Carril was dead.   Days after Mr. Menem went to the Olmos penitentiary toinaugurate modernization work, 33 inmates died in a blaze.   Just as he was about to board his plane to Kuala Lumpurearlier this month, a truck carrying a crane crashed into theaircraft.   Must more evidence be adduced? Taxi driver CarlosBrachetti thinks not. &quot;I hate to believe this stuff,&quot; hesays. &quot;But one has to face facts: The man is a mufa.&quot;   Mr. Menem, of course, doesn't buy the line. Pressed byreporters upon his return from his ill-fated trip to Italyabout the bad luck he seems to sow like Johnny Appleseed, anirascible Mr. Menem said all this mufa talk is &quot;sheernonsense.&quot;   He certainly didn't assume blame for Argentina's loss toCameroon. &quot;I wasn't on the playing field,&quot; he said, addingthat no one blames Mikhail Gorbachev because Romania beat theSoviet Union. &quot;Argentina was never as lucky as {it has been}under this government,&quot; he said.   With the nation in deep economic crisis, many Argentinescan't quite fathom that claim. But there is a rough consensusthat Mr. Menem has been a source of amusement.   Mufas, they say, bring bad luck to others but lead charmedlives themselves. Mr. Menem's own luck hasn't been all thatterrific lately. He might wish to point that out next timesomeone says he's a mufa. Mr. Menem's personal life has beenin considerable disarray. The reason: what Argentines call&quot;la crisis matrimonial,&quot; a domestic battle royal between Mr.Menem and his wife of 23 years, Zulema.   The two have been on the outs, on and off, for years butwere reconciled in 1988 during the presidential campaign. Nosooner had Mr. Menem assumed the presidency, however, thanthe spats resumed -- more this time over politics than overMr. Menem's alleged philandering, which had been an issue.Mr. Menem, a lip-service Peronist, clashed with his wife, whois more orthodox. She, who consorts with her husband'scritics, said Mr. Menem's entourage is corrupt. &quot;She is mybiggest opponent,&quot; Mr. Menem grumbled.   Mrs. Menem moved out of the president's officialresidence, saying that the phones were bugged. She moved backin, then he moved out. He slept at the office or at the homesof friends. She denied him access to his sash and scepter.   Unable to persuade his wife to leave the Quinta de Olivos,the 59-year-old Mr. Menem issued a decree ordering her to go.She came home one day to find that she had been locked out.   &quot;Corruption is taking hold of the country,&quot; she said.&quot;This is much more than the breakup of a marriage, this is apolitical problem.&quot;   Mr. Menem has handled the matter rather more firmly thanhe has handled hyperinflation, and public opinion seems torespect his actions vis-a-vis Zulema. But does that mean heisn't a mufa? Hardly. It proves only that he's no luckier inlove than he is on the soccer field or in the cockpit. Andsome Argentines, unamused by any of this, don't just refuseto utter his name, they don't want to talk about the Menems'cat fight at all.   And he, known for flamboyance, is for once lying low.Courting the danger of meeting up with Mr. Menem, thisreporter out of a sense of professional duty and diligencerequested an interview for this story. Much to his relief, hegot no reply.</TEXT></DOC>
