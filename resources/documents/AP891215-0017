They filled the airwaveswith information, some of it frenetic, some of it wrong, all of itthrilling.   ``I'm hit,'' screamed a woman reporter over the air when a shelllanded nearby. She continued to broadcast as her van rushed her tothe hospital, where doctors found she was suffering only from shock.   Such was the wild, free-wheeling style of radio reporting hereduring the eight-day uprising launched by mutinous soldiers on Dec.1 in an unsuccessful effort to topple President Corazon Aquino.   Filipinos listened to the rebellion on the radio, absorbed byround-the-clock running coverage by what is the major medium fornews and information here.   ``We got threats from all kinds of people almost every day,''said Nolan Sison, managing editor of DZRH radio. ``We tried tobalance our reporting, and the threats from both sides made usthink we did have a balanced programming.''   Differences in reporting style showed the slant of individualstations.   Reporters and anchormen for DZMM screamed at colleagues fromrival stations for airing ``tactical information,'' such aspositions of government forces and the types of firearms andvehicles used.   ``You are traitors to our country,'' a reporter lectured on theair.   As tension mounted, the government warned it would strictlyenforce existing guidelines giving it authority to close stationsthat broadcast hostile propaganda or ``disinformation.''   Newspapers are exempt from such controls. Publishers say theyreceived no directives from the government on what to print.Individual reporters claim, however, they have been lectured bymilitary and civilian officials angry at stories perceived asfavorable to the rebels.   The National Telecommunications Commission closed Manila radiostation DZEC after it erroneously reported that Mrs. Aquino fledthe palace at the height of the coup attempt.   The station has been the chief outlet of supporters of FerdinandMarcos, who died in Hawaiian exile this year after being ousted aspresident in February 1986.   The commission also shut down Cebu radio station DYLA after itbroadcast a taped interview of rebel leader Brig. Gen. EdgardoAbenina. A week later, the commission reopened the station at therequest of church leaders.   So far, the government has issued no formal warnings againstother stations. It did not prevent the stations from interviewingrebels after they gave up strongholds in the Makati financialdistrict on Dec. 7, despite the ``ban'' on rebel propaganda.   But stations that adopted a more balanced editorial policy facedanother problem _ fending off threats from both governmentofficials and the rebels.   Sison of DZRH said the staff received frequent calls fromDefense Secretary Fidel Ramos and military officials demanding thatthe station omit detailed reports of rebel attacks on militarycamps.   Rebels also demanded that reporters covering the street fightingbroadcast their propaganda.   Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of the military-civil relationsoffice, complained at one point that such detailed reporting washelping rebel soldiers correct their aim during air and artilleryattacks at the armed forces headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo.   Stations also received threats from mutineers who demanded thatthey transmit only rebel propaganda. One reporter, who spoke oncondition that his name and station not be mentioned, said rebelsthreatened him after management refused to broadcast his interviewwith them.   Television stations reacted more cautiously. All but one of thefive Manila stations, including the government station, went offthe air on the first day of the coup attempt.   Technicians at the four stations removed essential transmitterparts to keep rebel soldiers from seizing their facilities andtelecasting propaganda.   In 1987, rebel forces loyal to Marcos took over privateradio-television station GMA-7 and broadcast statements.   GMA officials said they learned from that experience and decidedto resume operations days later, when it looked like the conflictwas over.   As the coup attempt unfolded, stations exercised a degree ofself-censorship by bowing to government demands that they avoiddetailed reports of tactical operations.   Several continued broadcasting reports of shelling at CampAguinaldo and elsewhere, for example, but would not state preciselywhere the rounds were falling. Government officers complained therebels were monitoring the reports and adjusting their aimaccordingly.   Stations still reported movements of government forces butwithout detailing exactly how many troops were deployed.   At least 113 people died in the coup, the most serious attemptyet to topple Mrs. Aquino.</TEXT></DOC>
