(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Art collector Robert Berdella toldinvestigators his fascination with the 1965 movie ``The Collector''may help explain why he tied up six men and sexually tortured thembefore killing them.   The movie starring Terrence Stamp and Samantha Eggar is about aman who keeps a woman in chains in his basement hoping she will fallin love with him. She eventually dies of pneumonia.   ``He said he had seen that movie several years ago and that hemay have fantasized about living out what was depicted in thatmovie,'' said Sgt. Troy Cole, who headed the investigation into thekillings.   Berdella first described the movie during the three days he wasinterviewed last week, and then remembered its title, said Det.Albert DeValkenaere.   ``Sometimes he just would head off in other directions,''DeValkenaere said. ``He didn't come right out and say this (themovie) is why'' he killed the men.   Berdella had remained silent about his motives since his arrestin April. He reached agreement to confess to the killings to avoidthe death penalty.   Berdella, who had admitted one murder earlier, confessed to fivemore Monday and was given life prison sentences in the deaths.   Two of the victims suffocated, one died of blood loss andinfection from being sexually tortured and three others died of acombination of being gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers.   Berdella kept the victims tied to a bed in his midtown KansasCity home until their deaths.   Berdella owned a flea-market shop, Bob's Bazaar Bizarre, where hesold trinkets from around the world as well as jewelry he designedhimself. Most of his collected artifacts, including 2,000-year-oldRoman vials said to be filled with tears, Tibetan exorcism knives,costume masks from Sri Lanka and puppets from Asia and Thailand,were sold at an auction to help pay his legal bills.</TEXT></DOC>
