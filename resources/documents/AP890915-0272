Although he noted his ``clear competitive disadvantage,'' Davissaid he too would pay $300 a share for the parent of UnitedAirlines. Late Thursday, UAL approved an offer in which employeeswould own 75 percent of the company, British Airways PLC would own15 percent and management 10 percent.   The pilots' offer requires labor and wage concessions and isopposed by the union representing United machinists. Flightattendants are still weighing the deal.   ``The magnitude of the labor concessions (the pilot-managementgroup) contemplates is significant,'' Davis said in a letter toUAL's board. ``Any bidder lacking those concessions is at a clearcompetitive disadvantage.''   The pilot-management group plan includes a seven-year, no-strikeguarantee by the pilots and other cost-cutting labor concessions,including lowered wages and benefits.   UAL declined comment on Davis' letter Friday.   But Robert Decker, an airline industry analyst for Duff andamp; PhelpsInc. in Chicago, said the latest volley by Davis suggests hebelieves a bid of more than $300 per share would be too much to pay.   ``He recognized that he can't top a bid by employees,'' saidDecker. ``But if the bid falls apart, then he'll be there to buy thecompany.''   A spokesman for United pilots, who have been attempting to buythe airline since 1987, said he feels certain the deal will becompleted.   ``We have proven our tenaciousness,'' said Hank Krakowski of theAir Line Pilots Association, representing 7,000 pilots. ``We are notgoing to relax until this company becomes an employee-ownedairline.''   The pilot-management coalition still faces several hurdles,including a decision by the airline's machinists to oppose thebuyout.   The International Association of Machinists, representing 25,000United employees, ``has no intention of participating in theproposal in its present form,'' Louis Schroeder, president of theunion's District 141, said in a letter released Thursday.   The machinists believe the deal would leave UAL heavily in debtand could threaten the job security of union members.   Flight attendants have begun talks toward possible participationin the buyout, said Carol Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Associationof Flight Attendants, representing more than 12,700 United workers.   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL fell 75cents a share to $279.75.   If a settlement were reached, UAL would top Avis Corp., with11,000 employees, as the country's largest employee-ownedcorporation.   Davis, the California investor who started the takeover battlesix weeks ago and previously bid $6.19 billion, or $275 a share forUAL, would not disclose his current stake in UAL, said spokesman JimFingeroth.   Davis said Friday that the course he has chosen to follow ``mayprovide us with a higher probability of success in acquiring UALthan attempting to bid against the coalition that has been arrayedagainst us.''   The pilot-management agreement was announced Thursday after theemployee group made a final presentation to a special committee ofthe UAL board and revealed the financing for its bid.   The deal still requires the approval of shareholders and theDepartment of Transportation, which is not expected to raise majorobjections.   With inclusion of financing costs, the deal would total $7.2billion. Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank have committed $3billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for anadditional $4.2 billion, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
