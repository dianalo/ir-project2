(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A majority of U.S. corporate controllersbelieve leveraged buyouts have a negative impact on the economy, ina sharp turnaround from a similar survey two years ago, the NationalAssociation of Accountants said Thursday.   Of about 1,000 members of the trade group responding to a surveytaken in the first week of January, 84 percent said leveragedbuyouts do not contribute positively to the economy. That contrastedwith February 1987 survey where only 47 percent of the respondentscriticized the buyouts.   ``The change seems to reflect disapproval of two or three recentlarge buyouts,'' said Earnest A. Huband, president of theMontvale-based accountant's association.   In a leveraged buyout, a purchaser uses the assets of a targetcompany to finance debts used to acquire the company. The tactic hasbecome increasingly popular in recent years, as reflected by lastyear's record $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by the firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Critics contend the huge amounts of debt loaded on to the targetcompanies make them especially vulnerable to failure during aneconomic downturn.   Of those responding to the survey, 60 percent indicated theywould like to see greater federal regulation of leveraged buyouts.That compared with 58 percent who were against greater federalregulation of LBOs in a survey conducted last May.   Of those supporting greater regulation, 45 percent said the bestway would be to eliminate the tax deduction for interest onleveraged buyout financing and 40 percent indicated the Securitiesand Exchange Commission should to take action. Only 15 percentindicated the Justice Department should become involved.   The NAA is the world's largest organization of managementaccountants and financial managers.</TEXT></DOC>
