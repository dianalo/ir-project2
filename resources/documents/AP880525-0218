Diane O'Connor, a spokeswoman, said she was told that thedepartment's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service signed thepermit for the Crop Genetics International Inc. of Hanover, Md.,aimed at protecting corn from the European corn borer through aprocess akin to inoculation.   The Environmental Protection Agency gave its approval on Tuesdayfor the test. Crop Genetics plans to take a harmless bacteriumfound in Bermuda grass and use it to carry a gene from anotherbacterium, called Cxc-Bt, that will then produce a toxin lethal tocorn borers.   The toxin would only be activated inside the alkaline stomach ofthe borer, a kind of caterpillar, after it eats the treated planttissue.   The acid stomachs of humans, birds, animals and fish simplydigest the protein.   Cxc-Bt ``will have limited persistence in the environment and isnot likely to be harmful to humans or other non-target organisms,''EPA said.   The effect on other organisms is not of concern, EPA said,because the parent Cxc strain is native to Maryland, thetoxin-producing gene will be naturally eliminated from the Cxc andstringent containment procedures will be followed.   The firm plans to inoculate 6,300 corn plants on 1.37 acres atits research farm at Ingleside, Md., and 3,500 plants on 0.78 acreat the Agriculture Department's Research Center in Beltsville justoutside Washington.   The test will last through this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
