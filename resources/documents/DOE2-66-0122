Subsidence was documentedas early as the 1920s over the Goose Creek field. Since then, subsidenceand/or faulting have been identified over the Saxet, South Houston, ChocolateBayou, Hastings, Alco-Mag, Clinton, Mykawa, Blue Ridge, Webster, andCaplen oil fields. Oil-production-related subsidence over these fieldsgenerally creates few environmental or engineering problems. One exceptionis the subsidence and faulting over the Caplen oil field on Bolivar Peninsula,where more than 1,000 ac of saltwater marsh has been replaced by subaqueousflats. Subsidence may be occurring over other fields but has not beenidentified because of limited releveled benchmark data. An evaluationof drill-stem and bottom-hole pressure data for the Frio Formation inTexas indicates extensive depressurization presumably from hydrocarbonproduction. Nearly 12,000 measurements from a pressure data base of 17,000measurements indicate some depressurization. Some of the Frio zones havepressure declines of more than 1,500 psi from original hydrostatic conditions.Subsidence and faulting may be associated with these fields in the Frioas well as other Tertiary formations where extensive hydrocarbon productionand subsequent depressurization have occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
