Chairman Don Johnston fired his heir apparent, the head of the ad agency group's J. Walter Thompson Co. unit, after the executive suggested stripping Mr. Johnston of his day-to-day operating duties and taking the company private in a leveraged buyout.    Joseph W. O'Donnell, J. Walter Thompson's chairman and chief executive officer, presented a buyout proposal to JWT's outside board members Friday. Mr. O'Donnell was fired almost immediately, and his duties were assumed by Mr. Johnston, who also is chief executive of JWT.    Company sources said Mr. O'Donnell's intention was to oust Mr. Johnston and take control of the company. However, in an interview from his Darien, Conn., home last night, Mr. O'Donnell said he was merely passing on for consideration an unsolicited buyout proposal from Claremont Group Ltd., a New York investment banking firm. He acknowledged, however, that he had separately suggested that Mr. Johnston give up the chief executive title and allow those responsibilities to revert to the J. Walter Thompson unit, which he headed. &quot;I lacked confidence in where the company was going,&quot; he said, explaining his request. Claremont Group declined to comment.    The company in a brief announcement said only that Mr. O'Donnell had &quot;left the company,&quot; but didn't elaborate. Mr. Johnston couldn't be reached for comment.    The buyout proposal is likely to lead to other takeover attempts, industry executives said. JWT long has been a rumored takeover target because of its excellent creative reputation coupled with a persistent inability by Mr. Johnston's management to keep costs down and profits up.    &quot;I'm sure there are people evaluating JWT. I think Wall Street is fed up,&quot; said Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim andamp; Co. Added James Dougherty, an analyst with County Securities USA: &quot;In most other public companies, anybody with the record he (Mr. Johnston) has would have been gone a couple of years ago.&quot;    Analysts' estimates of JWT's break-up value range from the high $30s to about $40 a share, although they said the value would be higher under a more financially savvy management. JWT's pre-tax profit margin has recently only been in the 4% range while comparable agencies have margins of 11% to 12%, they said.    JWT sources said they expect more executive firings at J. Walter Thompson as Mr. Johnston attempts to ferret out those who allegedly supported Mr. O'Donnell. At the top of the list, the sources said, are John E. Peters, J. Walter Thompson's chief operating officer, and Victor S. Gutierrez, chief financial officer. Mr. Johnston is scheduled to meet with both men this morning, the sources said.    Messrs. Peters and Gutierrez couldn't be reached for comment.    JWT is one of the nation's largest ad agency groups, having created, among other campaigns, Burger King Corp.'s &quot;Herb&quot; and International Business Machines Corp.'s &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; campaign. Burger King is a unit of Pillsbury Co. Aside from J. Walter Thompson, JWT also owns Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc. public relations agency and Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc., which does top-of-the-line advertising for clients including IBM.    Mr. O'Donnell's actions took the industry by surprise. JWT closed at $31.125 a share, up 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.    According to board sources, Mr. O'Donnell, 43 years old, first approached Mr. Johnston about the proposals last Tuesday in a meeting at the company's midtown Manhattan headquarters. Mr. Johnston, 59, didn't respond immediately. Mr. O'Donnell then met Friday with five of six outside directors and Mr. Johnston; JWT's board has 12 members, including Mr. O'Donnell. He said he hasn't been asked to resign from the board, of which he was just made a member Jan. 1.    Accounts of that meeting differ. Board sources said Mr. O'Donnell proposed installing himself as the head of the entire company and then taking it private in a leveraged buyout. The directors at the meeting were &quot;shocked&quot; by Mr. O'Donnell's plan and rejected it unanimously, a source close to the board said. Mr. O'Donnell then left the meeting, and the directors approved Mr. Johnston's recommendation that the unit's head be fired. &quot;The trouble is he tried to take over the group. It was blind ambition,&quot; the source said.    Mr. O'Donnell, however, said he merely presented the Claremont proposal and his suggestion that Mr. Johnston be relieved of some of his duties as matters for discussion. &quot;I wanted to raise some issues behind closed doors that had to be aired. I did it. It was never my intent for it to be public,&quot; he said. He added that he suggested the management shakeup because of concerns &quot;about the financial direction of the company.&quot;    Although JWT didn't announce reasons for Mr. O'Donnell's departure, Mr. Johnston said in memo to be distributed to JWT clients today that he doesn't believe that Mr. O'Donnell, &quot;who has been in his present position for less than a year and previously was an office manager, was equipped to lead the group.&quot; Mr. O'Donnell had been general manager of J. Walter Thompson's Chicago office before becoming the agency's top executive last March. Mr. O'Donnell was widely expected within the industry to be named JWT's chief executive after Mr. Johnston retired at age 65.    Nevertheless, JWT's actions seem certain to expose Mr. Johnston and his board to criticism from the financial community, which thought Mr. O'Donnell was moving the company in the right direction financially.    Mr. Johnston, who has been leading the company since 1974, has been credited with engineering a creative turnaround at the big ad agency, which once was distinguished primarily for churning out dull advertising, earning it the nickname &quot;J. Walter Tombstone.&quot; He boosted salaries and offered attractive benefits to attract top creative people, according to industry executives.    But at the same time, JWT has continued to have financial difficulties. As revenue increased over the past several years, earnings slid, to $2 a share in 1985 from $2.24 in 1984. Analysts estimate that earnings for 1986 will be even more dismal, with estimates ranging between $1 and $1.25 a share.    The problem, analysts said, is that Mr. Johnston seems unable or unwilling to pare costs. Despite an industry-wide advertising slump that has prompted even the most successful agencies to cut back on staff, JWT has been slow to lay off personnel.    Analysts also note that in JWT's attempt to create a world-wide advertising network, it has made unprofitable investments overseas. In 1985, for example, the company took a $2.7 million charge because of the divestiture of its EA-International advertising units in Europe.    JWT has often said it is trying to cut costs, and started making efforts to do so last year. Yet that task is made more difficult because the company has had four chief financial officers since 1980. &quot;The CFO just doesn't have enough authority to put in a meaningful cost control operation,&quot; contends County Securities' Mr. Dougherty.    A JWT spokesman defended the company's financial management. &quot;I think the analysts underestimate the complexity of a turnaround,&quot; he said. &quot;When Don Johnston came in (he was named president in 1974), JWT's reputation was in shambles. We had to turn that around.&quot;    Last fall, analysts were impressed when JWT announced it would buy back as many as 500,000 shares. At the time, the move was seen as a way to shore up its sagging stock price and discourage any potential takeover attempt.    Still, JWT's financial problems weren't lost on the investment community. &quot;These guys consistently have generated the lowest margins and yet have some of the best work. Those are the ideal conditions for someone to buy it,&quot; said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Tobin. Indeed, it is understood that at least two investor groups considered a takeover of JWT last fall, when the stock price dipped into the mid-$20s. The stock buyback and the subsequent rebound in its price apparently quashed those efforts.    Analysts said any offers likely will be from investor groups rather than from other ad agencies. Any agency with the resources to take over JWT, they said, would have too many competing clients to make a merger work. </TEXT></DOC>
