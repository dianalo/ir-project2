Gordon Crovitz, as apologist for both President Bushand Judge Clarence Thomas, advances his cause not on thejudge's virtues qualifying him for the Supreme Court, but bycasting derision on groups that oppose the judge'sappointment because of his negative civil-rights stance(&quot;Borking Begins, but Mudballs Bounce Off Judge Thomas,&quot; Ruleof Law, op-ed page, July 17). Mr. Crovitz told us nothing ofwhy and how Judge Thomas is qualified.   The Washington Post recently ran an article entitled &quot;At87, Edwin N. Griswold Is the Dean of Supreme CourtObservers.&quot; Mr. Griswold, a lifelong Republican, argued 127cases before the Supreme Court. I would think he is in abetter position to give us a sounder opinion about JudgeThomas. Mr. Griswold expressed deep disappointment in Mr.Bush's choice to fill the position of the vacancy left byJustice Thurgood Marshall: &quot;This was a time when Bush shouldhave come up with a first-class lawyer, of wide reputationand broad experience, whether white, black, male or female.And it seems to me obvious he did not do so. Thomas, though afine, honest person, has no breadth of experience at all.&quot;Mr. Griswold feared Judge Thomas might help the court wipeaway decades of civil-rights gain.</LP><TEXT>   Thomas Jefferson observed, &quot;No duty the Executive had toperform was so trying as to put the right man in the rightplace.&quot; But what more could be expected of President Bush,who selected Dan Quayle for his vice-presidential runningmate and John Sununu as chief of staff?   Nicholas J. Fotos   Annapolis, Md.                                                                                                          In the same column in which he praises Robert Bork as the&quot;single most-qualified nominee&quot; for the Supreme Court, Mr.Crovitz also states: &quot;A close understanding of the Founders'background in natural-rights theory is important ininterpreting the original intent of the document they leftbehind.&quot;   That statement cannot be reconciled with his praise ofRobert Bork. Mr. Bork espouses a weird kind of constitutionalpositivism, whereby he swears allegiance to the originalintent of the constitutional Framers, while he disdains andrepudiates the natural-rights philosophy on which theConstitution was based.   Mr. Bork may be a first-rate advocate in the courtroom,but as a jurist he was at best second-rate, and as a scholarof the Constitution, not even third-rate.   Paul Raymond Dickman   Chicago                                                                                                          Paul A. Gigot's (&quot;The Real Reason the Black Caucus OpposesThomas,&quot; editorial page, July 19) and Mr. Crovitz's (July 17)absolutely brilliant pieces on Judge Thomas should berequired reading for every senator and staff member of theSenate Judiciary Committee. In fact, I'm sending copies to mysenators, Bill Bradley and Frank Lautenberg. The venom andvituperation spewing from the various interest groups on theleft are appalling. I saw Harvard Law Prof. Derrick Bell on&quot;Nightline,&quot; the night the nomination was announced, statingin essence that Mr. Thomas looks black but thinks white. Icould not believe what I was hearing. Looking at the groupsarrayed against Mr. Thomas should make most reasonableAmericans strongly supportive of him.   So he tried marijuana in school. Big deal] If that is areason for disqualification, then at least 80% of mylaw-school class (I graduated in 1973), and probably asimilar percentage of most other lawschool graduates fromthat time, are also disqualified.   If a liberal judge like David Bazelon or Arthur Garrity(two prominent jurists in the 1970s) had been hit with allthis mud, the liberals would have screamed &quot;witch hunt.&quot; Butbecause Mr. Thomas is conservative, it appears to beacceptable. Can you imagine what problems such people as HugoBlack (a onetime member of the Ku Klux Klan), William Douglas(a proponent of Zen and other Eastern religions) or JohnMarshall Harlan (extremely outspoken and conservative) wouldhave getting confirmed today? Yet look at the impact each onehad on the court during the middle decades of this century.Each one probably would have been &quot;Borked.&quot; Or what aboutClement Haynsworth, probably the pre-eminent Court of Appealsjudge of the 1960s and 1970s? His nomination by Richard Nixonwas &quot;Borked&quot; merely because he came from the South, and wecouldn't have one of them on the court, could we?   Judge Thomas's early praise of Louis Farrakhan (whether hemade the alleged speech or not) doesn't concern me (as a Jew)one iota, because he later repudiated Mr. Farrakhan once hefound out what the man was really about. Both Messrs. Crovitzand Gigot are correct in their conclusions that the mainargument in opposition to him is that he doesn't fit the moldof being beholden to the social-welfare system these groupsfeel every minority should support. It's easy for the BlackCaucus to oppose him, since none of them get to vote on thenomination and therefore don't have to face theirconstituencies on this issue.   Judge Thomas is a self-made man who accomplishedeverything through his own (heaven forbid) individualefforts, and exemplifies what the American dream should beall about. He should be a hero to these groups, not a pariah.   Gary Aronowitz   Fair Lawn, N.J.                                                                                                          We were disappointed by the false and unfair comment inyour July 25 editorial &quot;Toward Justice Thomas&quot; that ourassociation is &quot;looking for dirt on Judge Thomas.&quot; The factsare that our Executive Committee, since 1987, has reviewedall nominees to the Supreme Court and we have done so on afair and objective basis. Justices Anthony Kennedy and DavidSouter were approved; Judge Robert Bork was not.   The Wall Street Journal and the nation can be assured thatour Executive Committee's decision will be based on asthorough and complete a record as possible.   A final point: You state that this association &quot;nearlylost its charity-tax status for its lobbying against RobertBork. . . .&quot; This is also false. The association's tax-exemptstatus as a nonprofit professional organization has neverbeen questioned. Five years before Judge Bork was nominated,we requested charitable-tax status that was initially grantedby the Tax Court in September 1987 (while the Bork hearingswere in progress) but its ruling was reversed by the SecondCircuit a year later.   Conrad K. Harper   President   Thomas H. Moreland   Chair of the Executive Committee   The Association of the Bar   of the City of New York   New York                                                                                                          In your July 19 page-one article &quot;Mystery Man: JudgeThomas, Billed as Conservative, May Prove Unpredictable,&quot;George Kassouf, of the Alliance for Justice, was quoted assaying, &quot;What's disturbing is that Clarence Thomas denigratesprograms that were important to his own rise.&quot;   What's truly disturbing is the sentiment implicit in thatstatement. It comes distressingly close to saying that it isall right to bribe people to favor a governmental program,and that once bribed, they should stay bribed.   Let me illustrate with two episodes from my ownexperience. I received a scholarship financed by the state ofNew Jersey to attend Rutgers College (then a privateuniversity not the state university it later became). I havelong opposed government subsidization of higher education. Isit &quot;disturbing&quot; that I denigrate a program that was importantto my own rise?   Second, I once occupied a rent-controlled apartment. Ibenefited from rent control. At the same time, I was stronglyopposed to rent control and took a public position to thateffect. Subsequently, I was in the position of a landlord,owning an apartment subject to rent control. Under thosecircumstances, I felt inhibited in speaking out against rentcontrol because I would benefit from its repeal. Was I wrongto behave as I did in both cases? Only in the first? Or onlyin the second?   Surely, a loyal citizen of a democracy is justified intaking advantages of opportunities his fellow citizens makeavailable, even if he personally opposes such governmentalactivity and has voted against it, just as he is obligated topay taxes, or suffer other burdens, imposed on him by thegovernment, even though he personally opposes suchgovernmental activity and has voted against it. It would bedestructive of a decent society if, in either case, it wasregarded as &quot;disturbing&quot; that he publicly expressed his viewsin favor of or against the measures in question.
