No. 34-27093; File No. SR-CBOE-89-06]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.;Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to a Proposed Rule ChangeRelating to the Arbitration Process and the Use of Predispute ArbitrationClauses</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on May 8, 1989, the ChicagoBoard Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposedrule changes as described in Items I and II below, which items have beenprepared by the self-regulatory organization (``SRO''). Amendments No.1 and 2, submitted on May 15, 1989 and July 14, 1989, respectively, proposedadditional changes to the Exchange's rules. The CBOE has requested acceleratedapproval of this proposal because the filing is substantially identicalto rule filings of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), National Associationof Securities Dealers (``NASD''), and American Stock Exchange (``AMEX'')that were approved by the Commission on May 10, 1989.\1\<NOTE/> The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit commentson the proposed rule changes from interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26805 (May 10, 1989),54 FR 21144 (May 16, 1989) (approving Files No. SR-NYS-88-8, SR-NYSE-88-29,SR-NASD-88-29, SR-NASD-88-51, SR-NASD-89-19, and SR-AMEX-88-29) (``May10, 1989 Order'').The proposed rule changes would amend the Exchange's rules for administeringarbitration proceedings and address many issues regarding the fairnessand efficiency of the arbitration process administered by the Exchange,as well as institute new requirements applicable to the use by Exchangemembers of predispute arbitration clauses in agreements with customers.The CBOE developed these proposed rule changes through the auspices ofthe Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration (``SICA''). The SROshave worked together over the past twelve years to develop uniform arbitrationrules through SICA, which is comprised of a representative from each SROthat administers an arbitration program,\2\<NOTE/> a representative of the securities industry, and four representativesof the public. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The SROs that administer an arbitration program are theCBOE, NYSE, NASD, AMEX, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, PacificStock Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, CincinnatiStock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange.On September 10, 1987, after a review of securities industry-sponsoredarbitration, the Commission sent to SICA a letter that set out its viewsregarding the need for changes to the Uniform Code of Arbiration (``UniformCode'').\3\<NOTE/> The Commission also sent letters to the SROs on July 8, 1988requesting that the SROs review the issues raised by the current use ofmandatory predispute arbitration agreements by their member firms.\4\<NOTE/> Since September 1987, SICA and its subcommittees have metregularly to develop proposals in response to the Commission's letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, to James E. Buck, Senior Vice President, NYSE, dated September10, 1987. This letter was also addressed separately to each of the othermembers of SICA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See</T3> letter from David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, to John J. Phelan,Jr., Chairman, NYSE dated July 8, 1988. This letter was also addressedto the senior executive officers of all other SROs that administer arbitrationfacilities. The majority of the proposals to amend the CBOE's rules were based on changesin the Uniform Code made by SICA largely in response to the September 1987and July 1988 Commission letters.\5\<NOTE/> The other proposals included in this order were developedto meet concerns that have arisen through the administration of the arbitrationprograms. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Exchange's rules developed in response to the Commission'sletters are CBOE Rules 18.10, 18.11, 18.13, 18.15(e), 18.27, 18.31 and18.35. Substantially identical rule filings sumitted by the NYSE, AMEX and NASDwere approved by the Commission on May 10, 1989. In its approval order,the Commission addressed fully the significant public dialogue and commentthat preceded its action. This notice and order granting accelerated approvalof the proposed rule change is consistent with the substance of the May10, 1989 order, and the discussion set out in that order is fully applicableto the CBOE rules approved herein. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The text of the proposed rule changes is available at the Office of theSecretary, CBOE, and at the Commission's Public Reference Section. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Purpose</ITAG>(a) <T3>Service of Pleadings. </T3>The CBOE proposes to modify the proceduresfor service of pleadings. Currently, the arbitration department of theCBOE serves all pleadings on the parties. As cases have increased, usingthe arbitration department as an intermediary for the service of pleadingshad added unnecessarily to delays in processing cases and to the cost ofoperating the arbitration system. The CBOE proposes to serve only the initialpleading in a case, the ``claim,'' and to require that parties serve allsubsequent pleadings directly upon one another. This approach is intendedto save administrative time and costs while continuing to ensure that respondentsreceive adequate notice of the institution of arbitration proceedings.Under amended CBOE Rule 18.15, parties also will be required to supplythe department of arbitration with sufficient additional copies of thepleadings for the arbitration department staff and each of the arbitrators.Additionally, the proposal specifies that service by first-class postageprepaid or by overnight mail service is considered to be made on the dateof mailing and service by other means is considered to be made on the dateof delivery.This proposed rule change would apply both to arbitration proceedings conductedpursuant to the simplified procedures for small claims under CBOE Rule18.4 and regular cases initiated pursuant to CBOE Rule 18.15.(b) <T3>Classification of Arbitrators. </T3>The arbitration panels at the SROsfor cases involving public customers have historically been composed ofa majority of ``public arbitrators'' and a minority of ``industry arbitrators''.However, there have not been clear requirements or specifications for whomay serve as a public arbitrator. Under the Exchange's proposal, amendedCBOE Rule 18.10 would specify who may not serve as a public arbitratorand who may serve as an industry arbitrator.The CBOE's proposal addresses the potential for real or apparent bias onthe part of public arbitrators who may have some professional or personalassociation with the securities industry. CBOE Rule 18.10 defines as anindustry arbitrator one who is associated with a member of an SRO, broker,dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, municipalsecurities dealer, or registered investment adviser. CBOE Rule 18.10 alsodeals with the appropriate role in the arbitration system of professionalssuch as attorneys or accountants who provide services to securities industryclients. The rule would classify as industry arbitrators, rather than publicarbitrators, attorneys, accountants and other professionals who devotedtwenty percent or more of their professional work effort to securitiesindustry clients within the last two years. In addition, the rule excludesfrom service as a public or industry arbitrator persons who are spousesor other members of the household of a person associated with a registeredbroker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities dealeror investment adviser.CBOE Rule 18.10 permits an individual who had been associated with thesecurities industry to become a public arbitrator after five years, ifthe individual has gone on to other work and is not retired from the securitiesindustry. Also, under the rule, industry retirees will no longer be permittedto serve as public arbitrators, although they may continue to serve asindustry arbitrators. In addition, the CBOE proposes to exclude anyonefrom its public arbitrator rolls who had spent a substantial part of hisbusiness career in the securities industry, notwithstanding the passageof five years. Accordingly, under the CBOE proposal, an individual whohad worked in the securities industry for a substantial period of timeand then left the profession for some other work would not, after fiveyears, be assigned to its public arbitrator roster.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The CBOE has also included in its filing guidelines forthe classification of arbitrators that complement its classification rule.In the guidelines, the CBOE states that while it will continue to classifyas public arbitrators lawyers and other professionals whose partners representthe securities industry, it will recognize challenges for cause againstthem.The CBOE is also proposing disclosure provisions designed to assist partiesin assuring that the panel assigned to each case is appropriately balanced.Under proposed CBOE Rule 18.11, the employment histories of the arbitratorsfor the past ten years as well as the information provided by arbitratorspursuant to separate disclosure obligations contained in proposed CBOERule 18.13 will be disclosed.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The disclosure rules are proposed rule changes discussedin subsection (c) of this notice. The rules require arbitrators to makeextensive disclosures to the parties.The amendments regarding the classification of arbitrators are designedto promote impartial and knowledgeable decisions in the arbitration ofdisputes between investors and broker-dealers. The reclassification ofsecurities industry retirees to the industry arbitration pool and the establishmentof a five year period before a former securities industry employee mayserve as a public arbitrator should relieve any doubts that investors mayhave had regarding the impartiality of the public arbitrator pool. Similarly,the judgment to exlude from the public arbitrator pool lawyers, accountantsand other professionals who regularly service the securities industry makesclearer the distinctions between the two arbitrator pools.(c) <T3>Arbitrator Disclosure and Background Information to be Supplied tothe Parties. </T3>The CBOE is also proposing changes to its rules dealingwith disclosures to be made by arbitrators, and with supplying arbitratordisclosures to the parties. Under the current rules, parties have beenprovided only with the names and current business affiliations of the arbitratorsproposed for their cases. The Exchange's proposed rule change would providethe necessary guidance to arbitrators about the types of relationshipsthat may create conflicts of interest. Moreover, parties have had to requestspecifically any other information from the arbitration departments withinvery short time frames. The Exchange's proposed rule change would provideto the parties all of the information disclosed by arbitrators pursuantto the amended disclosure rules at the time when the parties are firstgiven the arbitrators' names. This change would provide full disclosureof arbitrators' backgrounds to parties at the earliest possible stage inthe process, and should therefore avoid unnecessary postponements of hearingsand promote knowledgeable use of challenges.Accordingly, proposed CBOE Rule 18.13(a) establishes specific disclosureobligations of arbitrators. The rule requires that arbitrators discloseany existing or past financial, business, professional, family or socialrelationships that are likely to affect impartiality or might reasonablycreate an appearance of partiality or bias. These disclosures extend toany relationships the arbitrators may have with any party, or its counsel,or with any individual whom they have been advised will be a witness. Therule also requires arbitrators to disclose any such relationship involvingmembers of their families or their current employers, partners or businessassociates.CBOE Rule 18.13(b) admonishes prospective arbitrators to make a reasonableeffort to inform themselves of any interests or relationships describedin paragraph (a). Rule 18.13(c) advises arbitrators that the duty to discloseunder paragraph (a) of the rule is an ongoing duty, and that any personwho serves as an arbitrator must disclose at any stage of the arbitrationproceeding any such interests, relationships, or circumstances that arise,or that are recalled or discovered. Also, under Rule 18.13(d), the CBOEhas clarified that prior to the first session, the director of arbitrationmay remove an arbitrator based on information disclosed pursuant to therule. Parties are to be informed of any information disclosed pursuantto the rule, if the arbitrator has not been removed.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ One the arbitration panel is sworn, it controls all ofthe procedural aspects of the hearing. Accordingly, under the Uniform Codeand the CBOE's Arbitration Code, the director of arbitration may not removean arbitrator after the hearings have begun. An arbitrator should be alertto the guidelines set out in the American Bar Association/American ArbitrationAssociation Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes (``ABA/AAACode'') and the applicable law with respect to arbitrator bias, and removehimself from the panel when conflicts arise after hearings have begun.<T3>See </T3>Canon II, E.(2) of the ABA/AAAa Code.As discussed above, CBOE Rule 18.11 provides that parties will be informedof the names and business affiliations of the arbitrators for the pastten years, as well as any information disclosed pursuant to Rule 18.13at least eight days prior to the date fixed for the initial hearing session.Under Rule 18.11, parties may also make further inquiry through the departmentof arbitration concerning the arbitrators' background.(d) <T3>Appointment of Replacement Arbitrators on a Panel. </T3>The CBOE isalso proposing two changes with respect to its ability to appoint a replacementarbitrator on a panel when a vacancy occurs. The first of these changesconcerns the ability of the director of arbitration to replace an arbitratorwho becomes unavailable to serve less than eight days prior to the firsthearing session. Under the proposed amendment, if after appointment andprior to the first hearing session an arbitrator resigns, dies, withdraws,is disqualified or otherwise unable to perform as an arbitrator, CBOE Rule18.11 authorizes the director of arbitration to appoint a replacement arbitrator.The rule permits the appointment of replacement arbitrators closer thaneight days to the hearing. The rule also explicitly provides that partiesare entitled to receive the same disclosure regarding the background ofthe replacement arbitrator as they received for the initial arbitrator(s),and have the same right to request more information, and to challenge thearbitrator as provided in the rules, although within a shorter time frame.The second change concerning the ability to appoint replacement arbitratorsaddresses situations where an arbitrator resigns, dies, withdraws, is disqualifiedor otherwise unable to perform as an arbitrator after the commencementof the first hearing session. Under the CBOE's existing rules, if a vacancyoccurs after the hearings have begun, both parties must consent eitherto the appointment of a replacement arbitrator to hear the rest of thecase, or to continuing with the remaining arbitrator(s). Otherwise, ifthat consent cannot be obtained, the case must be reheard from the beginningwith a full panel.The proposed amendment to CBOE Rule 18.14 permits the remaining arbitratorsto continue with the hearing and determination of the controversy. However,under the proposal, if a party objects, a replacement arbitrator wouldbe appointed by the director of arbitration under the same procedures asfor the replacement of an arbitrator prior to the first hearing. The ruleis designed to permit parties in particular cases to make the decisionthat makes the most sense for their case. For example, in cases where onlyperipheral issues have been dealt with and relatively little progress hasbeen made, it may make sense for parties to request a replacement arbitrator.Conversely, where the hearings have progressed significantly, or are infact substantially completed, it would make less sense for parties to requesta replacement arbitrator, who then would have to learn all that had occurredin his absence.In the event that parties do request a replacement arbitrator, it is clearthat the arbitrators have the authority to require the rehearing of partor all of the case, or to withdraw from the case, effectively requiringthe appointment of another panel, as is appropriate in their judgement.With this rule change, however, a party may no longer delay the resolutionof the dispute by insisting on a rehearing whenever an arbitrator unexpectedlyis unable to continue in his hearing of a case.(e) <T3>Availability of Small Claims Procedures and the Number of ArbitratorsRequired to Hear a Claim. </T3>The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 18.4(e)to increase to $10,000 from $5,000 the monetary claim limit for cases tobe heard under the simplified procedures developed in the Uniform Code.Under these expedited procedures, a single arbitrator decides a case basedupon the papers submitted by the parties. No oral hearing is held unlessrequested by the investor, or ordered by the arbitrator. This change isdesigned to decrease the costs of arbitration.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ CBOE Rule 18.4(c) would establish a filing fee of $200in cases where the amount in controversy is more than $5,000 but does notexceed $10,000.CBOE Rule 18.10(a) would change the number of arbitrators generally usedfor large cases from five to three. The rule currently provides for theappointment of five arbitrators in cases brought by public customers inwhich the claim exceeds $500,000. In order to alleviate administrativedelays and costs frequently encountered in such cases, the proposed rulewould eliminate the requirement of five-member panels, allowing the directorof arbitration to exercise discretion in appointing panels of no fewerthan three and no more than five arbitrators in cases not heard under theCBOE's simplified arbitration procedures.The CBOE also proposed a technical amendment, in CBOE Rule 18.4(e), regardingthe single arbitrators used in cases administered under the simplifed procedures.The amendment codifies the existing practice of appointing a public arbitratoras the single arbitrator in the case.(f) <T3>Discovery. </T3>The CBOE is proposing significant changes to its arbitrationdiscovery rules, which should assist in the early resolution of discoverydisputes and encourage the efficient resolution of cases on their merits.Under current Exchange rules, parties have been expected to exchange documentsinformally and voluntarily. Parties may also request documents pursuantto subpoena under the existing rules, but these do not have to be produceduntil the day of the hearing.The CBOE's proposed discovery rule expands party access to prehearing discoveryand provides specific time frames for parties to request information fromparties and for responding to such an information request. The rule alsoestablishes a mechanism for prehearing conferences and for arbitrator involvementin prehearing matters where needed. Under the CBOE's proposed rule changearbitrators may also order depositions when appropriate.Proposed CBOE Rule 18.15(e)(1) continues the policy established under existingrules for parties to cooperate to the fullest exent possible in the voluntaryexchange of documents and information. In the event that voluntary exchangesare not sufficient, the rule estalishes a clear framework for documentproduction and information requests.Proposed CBOE Rule 18.15(e)(2) provides that a party may serve a writtenrequest for information or documents twenty days after service of the claimor upon the filing of the answer, whichever is earlier. All parties areto receive copies of the request, and parties are required to endeavorto work out disputes regarding the request between themselves before anobjection to the request is filed. Unless the requesting party allows moretime, information requests must either be satisfied or objected to withinthirty calendar days from the date of service. The party who made an informationrequest has ten days from receipt of the objection to respond to the objection.Under the proposal, a party whose information request has not been satisfiedmay request in writing that the director of arbitration refer the matterto a prehearing conference. Parties may also find that there are othermatters in addition to unresolved information requests that require theassistance of a prehearing conference. CBOE Rule 18.15(e)(4) provides thatthe director of arbitration may appoint someone to preside over the prehearingconference. The prehearing conferences could be held either in person orby telephone conference call, and are designed to help the parties to reachagreement on such matters as the exchange of information, exchange or productionof documents, identification of witnesses, identification and exchangeof hearing documents, stipulations of fact, identification and briefingof contested issues, and any other matter which will expedite the arbitrationproceedings.When a prehearing conference is unable to resolve any of these issues,CBOE Rule 18.15(e)(5) provides for the director of arbitration to appointa single arbitrator to decide the issues outstanding. The rule allows thearbitrator to issue subpoenas, direct appearances of witnesses, directthe production of documents and depositions, and set deadlines and issueany other ruling which will expedite and the hearing and permit any partyto develop fully its case. CBOE Rule 18.15(e)(5) provides that the singlearbitrator appointed to decide prehearing matters would be a public arbitratorin those cases where public customers have requested a majority of publicarbitrators for their panel.Other amendments to the prehearing provisions require parties to serveon one another at least ten days prior to the first hearing copies of documentsin their possession that they intend to present at the hearing and identifywitnesses they intend to present at the hearing. Under proposed CBOE Rule18.15(e)(3), arbitrators may exclude from the arbitration, documents notexchanged or witnesses not identified at that time. The provision doesnot extend to documents or witnesses that parties may use for cross-examinationor rebuttal. In addition, the CBOE is proposing to amend its rules regardingsubpoenas. In CBOE Rule 1815(e)(6), the Exchange proposes to require partiesto serve copies of all subpoenas on all parties. (g) <T3>Preservation of a Record.</T3> The CBOE is amending its arbitrationrules to assure that records of arbitration proceedings are made and preserved.These records are necessary for courts to use in conjunction with any reviewof the proceedings they may make. CBOE Rule 18.27 would codify a requirementthat a verbatim record by stenographic reporter or tape recording be maintained.The rule further provides that, if a party to a proceeding elects to havethe record transcribed, the cost of such transcription shall be born bythat party unless the arbitrator(s) direct otherwise. If a record is transcribedat the request of a party, the rule requires that a copy shall be providedto the arbitrators.  (h) <T3>Content and Public Availability of Arbitration Awards. </T3>The CBOE'sproposed rule for arbitration awards expands both the content and publicavailability of arbitration awards. Prior to the Commission's May 10, 1989approval of the amended arbitration rules of the Amex, NASD and NYSE, andprior to the submission of the proposal made in this filing, the only informationgenerally available to the public regarding SRO arbitration cases was thepercentage of investors that received some portion of the amount they claimedagainst their broker-dealer. No data had been previously available withrespect to particular arbitrators' awards. The CBOE's proposal affordssubstantially more public access to the results of this process of disputeresolution.  Proposed CBOE Rule 18.31(e) provides that awards shall contain the namesof the parties, a summary of the issues in controversy, the damages and/orother relief requested, the damages and/or other relief awarded, a statementof any other issues resolved, the dates the claim was filed and the awardrendered, the number and dates of hearing sessions, the location of thehearing(s), the names of the arbitrators and the signatures of the arbitratorsconcurring in the award. The awards, including any written opinion voluntarilyprepared by the arbitrators, are to be made public, except that the namesof customer parties to the arbitration will be excluded pursuant to proposedCBOE Rule 18.31(f) if the customer parties request in writing that theirnames not be included on the public version of the award.  (i) <T3>Arbitration Fees.</T3> Under proposed CBOE Rule 18.33, the fees thatmay be assessed by the arbitrators for particular cases have been significantlyincresed n order to defray the CBOE's costs of administering its arbitrationprogram.\1\\0\<NOTE/> For example, CBOE Rule 18.33(a) proposes that all partieswho file claims, such as counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims,now should be required to pay deposits. Under the existing rules, depositsare required only of original claimants. This significantly increases thepotential fees that may be recovered by the Exchange and assessed againsta party since arbitrators may assess costs against a single party. ProposedCBOE Rule 18.33(d) would raise to $200 from $100 the minimum deposit forcases where no money damages are claimed. Proposed CBOE Rule 18.33(h) setsa fee for prehearing sessions with an arbitrator of seventy-five percentof hearing session fees.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The CBOE has advised the Commission that its costsfor administering its arbitration program for the years 1987 and 1988 were$17,000 and $32,500, respectively. It recovered $0 in 1987 and $0 in 1988through the arbitrators' assessment of fees.  Proposed CBOE Rule 18.33(c) also clarifies that arbitrators may assessthe costs of conducting a hearing against the parties as they deem appropriate.These costs include not only the fees for each session, but all other costsof conducting the hearing contemplated under the rules, such as the costsof transcribing a record, or producing witnesses or documents, and anyother cost contemplated by the agreement between the parties or permittedby applicable law.  Finally, the CBOE is proposing to codify its definition of a ``hearingsession''. Under proposed CBOE Rule 18.33(b), a ``hearing session'' wouldbe a meeting between the parties and arbitrators that lasts less than fourhours.  (j) <T3>Predispute Arbitration Clauses.</T3> The CBOE also proposes two rulechanges designed through the auspices of SICA to improve disclosure tocustomers in account opening agreements and to restrict the content ofthe arbitration clauses. Under the proposed rule change, CBOE Rule 18.35would require broker-dealers that employ predispute arbitration clausesto place immediately before the clause introductory language that wouldinform customers that they are waiving their right to seek remedies incourt, that arbitration is final, that discovery is generally more limitedthan in court proceedings, that the award is not required to contain factualfindings and legal reasoning, and that the arbitration panel typicallywill include a minority of arbitrators associated with the securities industry. Proposed CBOE Rule 18.35 would require that the disclosure language behighlighted four ways. First, large or otherwise distinguishable type mustbe used. Second, the disclosure language must be set out in outline formso as to be noticeable to readers. Third, a statement, also highlighted,that provides that the agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause,and where that clause is located in the contract, must be inserted intothe agreement immediately preceding the signature line. Fourth, a copyof the agrement containing a predispute arbitration clause must be givento the customer, who is to acknowledge receipt of the agreement, eitherin the agreement itself or in a separate document.  Additionally, proposed CBOE Rule 18.35 prohibits SRO members from havingagreements with customers that limit or contradict the rules of any SRO,or limit the ability of a party to file any claim in arbitration or limitthe ability of the arbitrators to make any award.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Statutory Basis  </ITAG>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent withSection s6(b) and 15A(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(b), 78o-3(b), whichrequire that national securities exchanges have rules designed to preventfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitableprinciples of trade, provide for an equitable allocation of fees, and,in general, protect investors and the public interest.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThis proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition.C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received From Members, Participants or OthersComments were neither solicited nor received.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action</ITAG>The Commission finds that there is good cause to approve the CBOE's proposedrule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication ofnotice of filing in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.11<NOTE/> The proposal is substantially identical to the NYSE, NASDand AMEX rule filings that were the subject of the Commission's May 10,1989 approval order.12<NOTE/> The NYSE's, NASD's and AMEX's versions of the same ruleswere published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, providing both the public and broker-dealercommunity with ample opportunity to comment on the proposed rule changethat is the subject of this release. All public comments directed at theother SROs' arbitration filings were considered in the context of the reviewundertaken for the Commission's May 10, 1989 approval order. In light ofthe Commission's thorough consideration of all comments directed at theSRO arbitration filings that were the subject of the Commission's May 10,1989 approval order, the substantially identical nature of the CBOE's arbitrationproposal, and the benefits that will accrue to investors from the availabilityof these improved arbitration procedures, the Commission believes thata good cause finding is justified.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>11 The proposed rule changes to CBOE Rules 18.4, 18.10, 18.11,18.13, 18.14, 18.27 and 18.33 are effective upon approval. The proposedrule changes to CBOE Rules 18.15 and 18.31 are effective only for casesfiled with the CBOE after September 1, 1989. The proposed rule change toCBOE Rule 18.35 will become effective September 7, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>12 <T3>See </T3>note 1, <T3>supra</T3>.The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirementsof sections 6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,13<NOTE/> which require that national securities exchanges and registeredsecurities associations have rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulativeacts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, providefor an equitable allocation of fees, and, in general, protect investorsand the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>13 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).The Commission believes that the proposed rules appropriately balance theneed to strengthen investor confidence in the arbitration systems at theSROs, both by improving the procedures for administering the arbitrationsand by creating clear obligations regarding the use of SRO members of predisputearbitration clauses, with the need to maintain arbitration as a form ofdispute resolution that provides for equitable and efficient administrationof justice. In particular, the rule changes affecting the classificationof arbitrators, arbitrator disclosure, discovery, the preservation of arecord, the form and public availability of awards, and guidelines forthe use of predispute arbitration clauses dynamically advance the publicinterest in SRO arbitration.14<NOTE/> Likewise, the SROs' initiatives with respect to the handlingof pleadings, appointment of replacement arbitrators, the use of smallclaims procedures, and the number of arbitrators should improve the efficiencyand speed of arbitration, maintaining those bargained for qualities oftraditional arbitration. Because these rules will aid in the just resolutionof disputes between investors and broker-dealers, we conclude that theserules are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, promotejust and equitable principles of trade and in general, protect investorsand the public interest consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. Thefee increases represented by these changes appear to be reasonable andprovide for an equitable allocation of fees among SRO members and investorsusing the arbitration facilities consistent with section 6(b)(4) of theAct.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>14 The Commission's approval of CBOE Rule 18.35, and the comparablerules of the NYSE, NASD and AMEX, is consistent with the conclusion ofthe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <T3>Roney v. Goren, </T3>No. 88-1874 (May 26, 1989), that the Commissionhas the authority to assure customer choice among SRO arbitration forums.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
