 Your data was backed up, safe and secure.andP;  Today, that'sdangerously negligent.andP;  It takes a lot more work than just duplicating filesto protect yourself.andP;  Backing up hundreds of megabytes of critical data callsfor a management procedure.andM;The topic of managing backup procedures as well as the activities of theusers has kindled great debate over the years.andP;  Diane Danielle, a LANadministrator; Michael Durr, a marketing and market research consultant; andDel Jones, a network consultant, share their views on the management ofsystem storage.andM;Q: Are LAN users demanding more reliability?andM;Del Jones: At OIT [The Oregon Institute of Technology], we had a bunch ofHarrises [Harris minicomputers] that were doing most of the work of trainingpeople on programming.andP;  The Harrises normally averaged 45 minutes of downtimeevery day.andP;  Nobody really complained.andM;We got the LAN up to the point where it was averaging 15 minutes of downtimeper quarter.andP;  Then one time, the LAN went down for five minutes and theywanted to hold an investigation panel: Who the hell was to blame for thisthing going down for five minutes?andM;The more reliability you've got, the more they require.andP;  It's just like thetelephone system.andP;  When was the last time it didn't work?andP;  And as soon as itdidn't work, everybody went up in arms.andP;  If it didn't work regularly, you'dget used to it.andM;Michael Durr: When they realize the costs, the demand more reliability.andP;  Iwas with Novell for five years.andP;  Around 1987 through 1988, I worked on theissues of system reliability.andP;  What became obvious to us at that time wasthat people who had LANs simply weren't looking at reliability as an issue.andO;You gave a talk to a group of information center people, and they would tellyou, &quot;Well, we all understand that reliability is an issue.andP;  But, when wetake this issue to upper management, they come back to us and say, 'These arejust PCs, why do you need to worry about reliability?&quot;'andM;Obviously, for the LAN industry, that kind of thing is a time bomb.andP;  For LANusers, who are becoming the dominant users in data processing, it is also atime bomb.andM;The fact is that people are going to start losing a lot of money as theirLANs start blowing up.andP;  And the bigger they get, the more likely they are tohave problems.andM;At Novell, I developed a report called the &quot;System Reliability Report.&quot;andP;  Iwanted to examine the cost of a LAN going down.andP;  People simply aren't awareof it.andP;  People think that if the system goes down, it means they're going tohave to get a new disk.andP;  Or they're going to have some people key in somedata.andM;I've got three main factors that contribute to the cost of downtime: lostdata, personnel downtime, and company image.andM;The third issue is probably the most nebulous, but I think it's one of themost important in developing this cost.andP;  What is the impact on the company'simage if it develops a reputation for being unreliable and not deliveringservices to its customers?andP;  If you assume that every time you have a systemfailure, you are probably going to lose one percent of your customers, youbegin to develop a real sense of the cost.andM;If you do backup on anything less than a regular daily basis, the costsbecome astronomical.andP;  They are clearly unmanageable.andP;  Just doing this kind ofrisk analysis makes it quite apparent to people that they should always backup daily.andM;Q: Does backup need to be a centralized function in order to be reliable?andM;Jones: Users don't have the skill to do a backup.andP;  I'm the biggest advocateof distributed data processing you can imagine.andP;  This is my field, mybackground.andP;  But the users don't have the skills, and the departments don'thave the equipment.andM;You can only do backup centrally, with trained people, with checklists thatactually get checked off, and where you can have massive storage.andP;  This meansyou have to reach out through the LAN and back up everybody's department.andO;Not just everybody's department, but also the end users' machines.andM;Durr: To increase the reliability on your network, you have to begin toemulate the systems that have been developed and evolved for mainframes.andP;  Thebasic needs remain the same, even though you need to address those needs in adifferent way.andM;So, you start out by emulating the centralized functions.andP;  You have tointegrate those functions; you have to centralize them.andP;  And then you have toautomate system storage management because you're not going to be able totake care of multiple remote LANs unless you have some intelligence runningin a computer that's taking care of the system.andM;Q: How do you design a backup system?andM;Durr: Too often, especially with professionals that have been doing the jobfor a long time, you have excluded all the options that you know don't work,and you have homed in on some options that you know do work.andP;  However, whenyou move to a different type of system, such as a distributed system, and youtry to apply those same types of prejudices, you're not managing the systemproperly.andP;  You need to step back from the system and say, &quot;What problems do Ineed to attack?andP;  How do I need to handle these problems?&quot;andP;  When you do that,just looking at the jobs, not at the hardware or the technology or whatever,you see how best to manage it.andM;You're not looking at simply doing backup, or at any of the components ofmanaging storage.andP;  You're looking at storage as a group of functions thatneed to be addressed.andP;  And you don't address them individually.andP;  You addressthem as a group, to include efficiency and system reliability.andM;Managing the disksandM;Q: How much disk space do you need?andM;Diane Danielle: I set up my first LAN several years ago.andP;  It had six PCs onit, and we got an AT server with a 60MB hard disk.andP;  I thought, &quot;This is goingto last forever.&quot;andP;  Three months later we had to get another drive.andM;About 10 days ago, I got a call from someone in my company who is setting upa locl area network.andP;  I asked, &quot;How big is it going to be?&quot;andP;  He said,Probably 10 or 12 stations.andP;  i've gotten a couple of bids from vendors; oneproposing a 150MB disk, another 600MB.&quot;andP;  I said, &quot;Don't get the 150MB disk;it won't be enough.andP;  I'd probably recommend 300MB, but if there's not thatmuch of a price difference, get the 600MB.&quot;andM;It's not that it's going to solve his disk space problem.andP;  It's just that bythe time it becomes a problem, he may be lucky enough to have gone somewhereelse, and it will be another persn's problem.andM;Q: Why is disk space management a problem?andM;Danielle:  Because users don't ever delete anything.andP;  I don't think they knowwhat the delete command is, or the erase command.andP;  Even if you put it on amenu, they don't see it; they don't want to use it.andM;First, it takes time to clean up your files.andP;  You need to figure out whatyou've got, what is in the files, what you need, and what you can get rid of.andM;Second, even if you're &quot;DOS smart--if you know how to format a floppy andcopy to a floppy--copying files a difficult, if only because you don't haveany way of knowing how many files are going to fit on the floppy you've justput in the drive.andP;  So, you do a COPY *.*, and it chokes somewhere on thefifteenth file.andP;  And then the users are stuck.andP;  They don't know how to splitit up onto the next disk.andP;  It's a pain.andM;But I think the most important reason that people don't like to delete filesis access.andP;  When you've got the data on the server, you can get to it quicklyand easily.andM;An attorney on one of my larger LANs has been with me since we started thenetwork, and she has every single memo she has written since day one on thatserver disk.andP;  We've talked about this.andP;  I've talked with her manager aboutthis.andP;  And her response--and her manager backs her up on this--is verysimple: Our word processor has a search function, and she can search throughevery document for a name, a word, a subject, anything.andP;  She can get toanything she wants within a matter of seconds.andP;  If understand that, but it isstill a problem.andM;One thing I've started to look for is a technique or system that will help myusers get rid of the files they don't need, make it easier for them to knowwhat they've got, easier for them to organize what they have onto diskettes,and easier to retrieve files.andP;  I saw one product that looked interestinguntil I found out that it didn't use a DOS format on its floppies.andP;  I don'twant anything on a floppy you can't read from DOS.andP;  It's just not worth thehassle.andM;Q: How can you manage disk space usage?andM;Jones: I don't have the same attitude towards storage and disk control thatDiane does.andP;  My sentiment is, &quot;Whatever you put on the LAN, keep it there!&quot;andM;I Have been trying to start this National LAN Lab, which the industry wasn'tread to support.andP;  They are more than happy to support with equipment but whenit comes to money...andP;  Money is always tight.andM;I had to find somebody that would fund me.andP;  Someplace where I could show thewold what I wanted out of a LAN lab.andP;  It wasn't quite like Frank Derfler's,where we were going to do performance testing.andP;  We'd do productivity testinginstead.andM;Well, I found this little group of the U.S.andP;  Army: the Toxic and HazardousMaterials Control Agency.andP;  You know, the ones that have these nuclear wastedumps and nerve gas and so on.andP;  They get funded.andP;  Even with this cutback ofDefense Department monies, they get funded.andP;  They're afraid Congress mightget a little bit mad at them if they didn't take care of this nerve gas.andM;Consequently, I have a small group, about 120 users, and we're throwing theworld at it.andP;  To give you some idea, I'll probably drop 15 gigs [gigabytes]on the PC side.andP;  That doesn't include the mainframe/mini side.andP;  For 120people, it looks like when I'm finished in about June, I'll have 10 NetWare386 servers.andP;  We're investigating WORM [write once/read many times]jukeboxes.andP;  We'll probably drop another 3k gigs on there.andP;  We're alsoinvestigating getting magneto-optical jukeboxes--probably another 35 gigs.andO;Remember, all of this is for 120 people.andM;I want people to be productive.andP;  I agree with the attorney.andP;  If she can findit on the disk, keep it there.andM;I think massive storage is where the market will be very shortly.andP;  We'reabout to hit a storage threshold.andP;  Magneto-optical will soon hit in a bog wayin the network market.andP;  We're very close to the point where storing an image,which takes about 156KB average in compressed form, will cost less than aXerox copy.andP;  At that point, prepare for the biggest computer disaster Americahas ever seen.andM;We're about to dump America's filing cabinets onto LANs.andP;  Whether you like itor not, that's what the managers are going to do.andP;  That's what they've beenlooking to do in this industry since Day One.andM;Massive storage is in your future.andP;  You've got to plan for it now.andP;  If youdon't, you're headed for trouble.andM;Durr: I take exception with the idea of having the system just grow and growand grow.andP;  A lot of us in the LAN industry have gotten used to online data.andO;I like to hit a button, and everything I've ever done is suddenly availableto me--until I have to find some of the things that I've had online for along time.andP;  Then it becomes a nightmare.andM;I prefer to take things offline that I'm not going to use all the time, andto keep things online that I am going to use.andP;  That does a couple of thingsfor me.andP;  It reduces management because I don't have to go through as muchmaterial to find things.andP;  And it reduces my need for large disks.andM;If you don't have the Aberdeen Proving Grounds [an army facility in Aberdeen,Md.] to buy your disks, you may want to take some of this data and put it oncheaper media, so you can use your expensive fast storage systems to storethe data that you need to get at immediately.andM;This approach provides much better performance.andP;  If you have large disks andmultiple disks all over the place, it reduces the performance of the overallsystem.andM;Archiving files that are not in current use also reduces the management costbecause it takes some of the files offline so that the manager is onlymanaging those things that the users need.andM;Danielle: To manage the disk space that you've got--because you will neverhave enough--you need some utilities.andP;  From my perspective, it has to bebuilt into your network operating system.andP;  You can't control a free resource.andM;When NetWare 286 V.2.1 came out with disk space management, I was justsalivating.andP;  It was going to solve my problems.andM;Unfortunately, in netWare 2.1, disk space management depends on who ownsfiles.andP;  That's how you control the space.andP;  It see a couple of flaws in thatlogic.andP;  First, anybody who updates a database automatically becomes the ownerof the database.andP;  Second, when you're printing, your spool files are alsoincluded in your disk space allocation.andP;  By the time you've given everybodyenough room so that they don't crash either the database or the printing,you've effectively given them free access to all of the free disk space onyour server.andM;NetWare 386 has better disk space management functions.andP;  You want to manageyour disk space at a directory level, at a user level, and at a group level.andO;We already have a number of directories that are group directories fordifferent departments.andP;  I'd like to say, &quot;Department X will get 10MB, butthey've got to manage it themselves.&quot;andM;Finally, you've also got to look at disk space allocation at a system level:how much you need for a database application, for instance.andM;Q: Are there other ways that the network operating system can help you managedisk space?andM;Danielle: I remember when I learned that NetWare keeps a file's last accessdate.andP;  I thought, &quot;On this is great.andP;  All I do is give these people a reportthat says, 'Look, you not only haven't written to this file, you haven't evenlooked at it in the past two years.andP;  Surely we can get rid of it&quot;'andM;The only problem is--and I think here the only exception is Palindrome--thattape backup software accesses your files to back them up.andP;  This makes thataccess date unusable from the disk space management viewpoint.andM;I do have a utility from Brightwork that we run before we do a tape backup.andO;It saves all of the access dates and then restores them after the tape backupprocess.andP;  But I shouldn't have to do that.andP;  I figure the tape software knowswhat files it's backing up: it ought to keep track of the original accessdate and restore that date when it's done.andM;Keeping CopiesandM;Q: How long do you need to keep backed up files?andM;Danielle: One of the things I've found out, in meeting people who are juststarting out with LANs, is that they underestimate significantly the lengthof time they need to retain different cyclical tapes.andP;  They think, &quot;We dothings on a day-to-day basis and nobody ever really needs to go back veryfar.&quot;andM;That's not true.andP;  You do.andP;  I have been keeping monthly backups for a year.andO;And I can tell you for an absolute fact that the thriteenth month, I got arequest for a file that had been on the 12-month tape that just got writtenover.andM;We keep the daily backups for two weeks, the weeklies for a whole month, andthe monthly backups for a year.andP;  But we're probably going to extend that toat least a year and a half or two years.andM;Jones: A year is a minimum.andP;  Remember those time-release computer viruses?andO;You'd better have storage dating back at least a year.andM;Q: How important is offsite storage?andM;Danielle: This is something that a lot of LAN people don't think about.andP;  Butif you plan for disasters, you want to think about having your tapessomewhere else.andP;  One of the problems this presents, though, is that if yourtape is offsite and your user needs a file, then you've got to get it fromoffsite.andP;  So what we have been constantly juggling is the need to solve ourusers' &quot;disaster&quot; problems, such as &quot;I erased the file I needed yesterday,&quot;and also to protect the investment for the whole network.andM;Right now, we send our weekly backups offsite to a location in a differentpart of California, and we actually walk our daily [backups] over to anotherbuilding where I manage another LAN, so those we can get to pretty quickly ifsomebody needs them.andM;Q: What are the problems with restoring files?andM;Danielle: You would be amazed how many people do their backups religiously.andO;They do all of the right things, they do incremental [backups], they do fullbackups, and they keep them.andP;  But they have never tried to restore a file.andM;The reason that you shouldn't trust your backup, no matter how good you thinkit is, is that tape failures are often a lot less obvious than disk failures.andO;If you have a disk problem, you can't write the file, or you can't read thefile.andP;  You know automatically that something's wrong.andM;With tape, that's not true.andP;  You can do a backup.andP;  It can seem to work fine,and you can still be unable to restore a file.andP;  And the only way that you cantell that is to restore files.andM;When I started testing the backup, I figured all I would have to do isrestore a file from the first part of the tape, and it would be okay.andP;  Thenone day, I tried to restore a file from the last half of the tape anddiscovered that I couldn't get to it.andP;  It must have taken about three hourson a Sunday to discover that there had been an open file in the middle of thebackup.andP;  I could get to files before the open file, but I could not get toany of the files past the open file unless I specifically included the openfile in my request for retrieval.andM;Whenever I do anything crucial on the network, such as reinitializing thedisk or something, I do not one, but two backups.andP;  I make sure I can restorea file from the beginning, the middle, and the end of the tape.andP;  Only then amI going to feel at least reasonably confident that I can get it back.andM;Speed and SecurityandM;Q: How important is speed in a backup system?andM;Danielle: You will hear some vendors arguing that their backups are slower,their restores are slower because they do more error correction, and they'retaking more care that the data's safe.andP;  I will acknowledge that it's atrade-off, but the simple truth is that if you've a 300MB or 600MB disk andyou've got to get a new operating system up over the weekend, you can't wait12 hours for a tape backup to complete.andP;  And you certainly can't wait 36hours to restore all the files.andP;  And I've seen, in most tape systems, atleast a two-to-one or three-to-one difference between the speed of the backupand the speed of a full restore.andM;LANs, unfortunately [from the point of view of not having a lot ofmaintenance staff], aren't mainframes yet.andP;  And that means a lot of workusually gets done at night or on weekends.andP;  So, the faster your system canback up your network, and the more reliably it can do it, the better offyou're going to be.andM;Q: Are there any current problems with backing up security rights?andM;Danielle: This was a major issue a couple of years ago with tape backupsoftware.andP;  Nobody knew about Novell's rights.andP;  The first time we had to do arestore, we discovered the problem.andP;  Files came back fine, but we spent thenext hour and a half trying to figure out what users we had and what rightsthey had to what directories.andM;Interestingly enough, NetWare 386 has regenerated the problem, at leasttemporarily.andP;  If you have a NetWare 386 system, and you have a tape backupsystem, you ought to use Novell's own utility for saving the rights for awhile.andM;This does not seem to be a tape vendor problem.andP;  Novell has not given themthe APIs [application programming interfaces] to get the rights.andM;Front to BackandM;Q: What is an &quot;archive bit&quot; and is it important?andM;Danielle: An archive bit tells the system when to back something up.andP;  It's&quot;set&quot; when you create or edit a file, so that the backup system knows thatfile needs archiving again.andM;All tape backup software should offer you the option to clear or not to clearthe archive bit.andP;  Some of them don't.andP;  And it can make a difference.andM;For instance, you may want to back up a particular server twice.andP;  But thatmay be impossible if the backup software insists on clearing the archive bitthe first time around.andP;  In another case, users may wish to make their ownindividual backups, while leaving the archive bit set so that their fileswill be included in the centralized backup as well.andM;Q: What do you look for in a tape backup user interface?andM;Danielle: This subject is very important to me.andP;  I really think every tapebackup system should have a menu front end and a command line.andP;  And youshould always be able to do everything with one that you can do with theother.andP;  Since most people do backups at night, and nobody wants to stay atnight to do the backups, you have got to be able to [run it as a] batch[file].andM;You ought to be able to back up single files as easily as you can back up thewhole system.andP;  And vice versa: You ought to be able to restore the entiresystem as easily as you can get a single file.andM;One of the products I was looking at last fall had to read my entire serverdisk before it would display a listing of directories and files from which Icould select items to back up.andP;  Well, this particular one was 300MB.andP;  It tookthree and a half minutes before I could even point to what it was I wanted toget.andP;  That's unacceptable.andM;This means, for one thing, that no one wants a catalog just on tape.andP;  Thereare obviously valid reasons for having the catalog on the tape, and it shouldbe there.andP;  But when your user comes to you and says, &quot;I erased this file, andI think I did it sometime last week Maybe it was Tuesday or Wednesday,&quot; youdon't want to sit there and load eight tapes, and wait for each to load itsdirectory.andP;  You want to be able to find out quickly where this person's fileis.andP;  So all tape software should be capable of creating a disk catalog, sothat when someone needs a file all you have to do is scan that directory orthat catalog on disk, and you will know immediately which tape you have to goto, to get the files.andM;I am not at all fond of &quot;learn&quot; modes [where the backup system &quot;learns&quot; thekeystrokes you enter and can play them back at a later date].andP;  One of theother LAN managers in my company spent a very painful week and a half with alearn mode of one vendor's tape software.andP;  He was trying to get it to dealwith each and every circumstance.andM;The manager finally had to run the learn mode during the day so that he couldbe certain he hit all possible conditions.andP;  This situation is totallyunacceptable.andM;You ought to be able to just stick the commands in a batch file and run it.andO;If they want to provide a learn mode, I don't have any objections.andP;  It justshouldn't be the only way to do it.andM;Michael Hurwicz is a consultant and freelance writer specializing innetworks.andP;  He is based in Eastsound, Wash.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
