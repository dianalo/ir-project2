<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-65-0562 </DOCNO><TEXT>Until the advent of commercial instrumentation for combined gas chromatographyand matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy (GC/MI-IR), applications ofinfrared spectroscopy to analyses of semivolatile organic compounds inair have been severely limited by the short residence times of GC eluentsin the light pipe of a typical GC/IR system and by the small quantitiesof sample, typically nanograms. They have employed GC/MI-IR to analyzeair sample extracts and fractions of these extracts, with good resultson a few nanograms of material. The authors will present examples ofthe analysis of wood smoke samples and discuss the information obtainableby use of the complementary techniques of GC/MI-IR and gas chromatography/massspectrometry.</TEXT></DOC>
