Three big orders have been delayed temporarily by Xyvision customers, a spokeswoman said. &quot;While we can't assure the results for the balance of the year,&quot; the company said, &quot;we believe that we will achieve our plan . . . as orders deferred from the first quarter are obtained in subsequent quarters.&quot;    Xyvision, a maker of computerized publishing systems, made its initial public offering in July 1986 and, therefore, didn't calculate per-share earnings in the yearago quarter.    Xyvision shares closed yesterday at $12.75, off $3.125, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
