But the agreement, reached Tuesday at a one-day meeting inLondon, will have little impact on the buoyant supply and weakdemand in the oil market, the analysts said.   ``I think it means the extension of the oil producers' cartel,even if the countries don't want to commit themselves to OPEC atthis stage,'' said Philip Morgan, an oil analyst at the Londoninvestment firm Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers.   There was little immediate reaction in the market. After thegroup issued a communique early evening outlining its plans, thespot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, was $16.30 a barrel, up 10 cents from lateMonday.   The group of independent oil producers said that a majority ofits members agreed to cut their oil exports, but it didn't identifythem, nor did it say by how much. Other participants agreed tofreeze their exports, it said.   ``Specific announcements with respect to the above decisions willbe made by the respective authorities in the course of next week,''the group's communique said.   Participating at talks at the Mexican Embassy were Mexico, Oman,Malaysia, Egypt, China, and Angola, the communique said. Alsoattending were observers from the Soviet Union, Colombia, NorthYemen, Norway, the U.S. state of Alaska and the Canadian province ofAlberta, it said.   The agreement ``is fairly significant,'' Morgan said.   It was important that the independent producers were actingunilaterally, analysts said, doing so because the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries has managed to curb its production.   Last year, independent oil producers offered to cut their outputby 5 percent if OPEC agreed to reciprocal cuts. OPEC refused.   Some OPEC members have expressed resentment that independentproducers enjoy the benefits of the cartel's production limitswithout making a contribution.   OPEC's 13 members are estimated to be producing about 19.5million barrels a day, 1 million barrels above their agreedproduction limit but well below their fourth-quarter output. OPEChas set a target price of $18 a barrel.   ``The psychological impact (on the oil markets) will be quitestrong,'' Morgan said. But, he added,``I think the total volume ofthe cuts makes little difference to the whole supply and demandquestion.''   James Henderson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. inLondon, said: ``Basically, we see it as fairly positive for the oilprice short-term.   ``Basically, it will help OPEC through the seasonal demanddownturn in the second quarter. We still see a dip in the oil pricebut not as dramatically as it would have been.''   Oil prices will fall to $14.50 to $15 a barrel in March andApril, Henderson predicted.   The analyst said he expects the independent producers to cutexports by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day in the April-Junequarter.   But, he said, a reduction of up to 300,000 barrels ``isn't goingto have a dramatic effect on the supply and demand balance.''   The communique also said some participants ``will go back totheir authorities for further consultations in order to determinetheir contribution.''   ``Further meetings of technical experts will be convened on aregular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the marketsituation as well as compliance with the agreement,'' the statementsaid.   The next such meeting was planned for May 16, and would ``alsoaddress the prospects of the second half of the year, a periodviewed by the experts with caution.''   ``The experts expressed the strong wish of their authorities tosee all oil-producing and exporting countries contributing to marketstability in a concerted way,'' it said.   Individual delegates wouldn't elaborate when they emerged fromthe meeting.   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
