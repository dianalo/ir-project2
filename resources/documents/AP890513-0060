Sheik Ali Khalifa Sabah of Kuwait declined to say whether thevote was unanimous, but sources said Libya cast a negative ballot.   The vote, a step by Egypt back into the Arab fold, came at ameeting of 10 OAPEC nations. Egypt is the 11th member of theKuwait-based organization.   Before the meeting, Arab sources called Cairo's reinstatement a``foregone conclusion.''   Libya's oil minister, Fawzi Shakshouki, indicated Tripoliopposed Egypt's return to OAPEC, but would abide by majoritydecision.   ``We will not pull out,'' Shakshouki said.   He said, however, Libya would continue to oppose Egypt's returnto Arab organizations ``as long as the causes of its suspension donot vanish.''   Egypt lost its place in all Arab institutions after itsmembership in the Arab League was suspended in 1979 for signing theCamp David Accords with Israel. Egypt has still not been reinstatedby the Arab League, but that move is expected at a May 23-24 Arabsummit in Casablanca, Morocco.   Libya and Syria have tried to block Egypt's return to Araborganizations. But the Syrians have in recent months moderatedtheir stand against Egypt.   Opening the meeting, OAPEC chairman Mana Saeed Otaiba, theUnited Arab Emirates' oil minister, called for restoring Egypt toOAPEC.   ``The Arab family will remain incomplete as long as Egyptremains outside,'' he declared. ``Egypt is a mother, sister anddaughter of the Arab nation ... we hope this meeting will handlethe question.''   OAPEC sources said the organization's charter stipulates thattwo-thirds of the members and two-thirds of the founders must votefor membership to be restored.   OAPEC, was founded in 1968 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya asa forum for coordinating Arab oil policies. The other members areIraq, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Bahrain,Syria and Egypt.   Seven countries double as members of the 13-nation Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries.</TEXT></DOC>
