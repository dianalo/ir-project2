<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-1062 </DOCNO><TEXT>In stellarator-type magnetic confinement devices (of which the torsatronis one), the magnetic field is produced entirely by external, current-carryingcoils. Two methods for mapping magnetic surfaces in the Auburn torsatronwere tested and compared, both of which involve the use of highly transparentscreens. The first method consists of coating the screen with a phosphorthat emits light when struck by electrons emitted by an electron gun.A pattern representative of a magnetic surface is formed on the screen,and this pattern is recorded photographically. The second method usesan uncoated screen to collect electrons emitted from an emissive probe,which is scanned over a poloidal cross section of the torus. Under certainconditions, the collected current is a constant over a particular magneticsurface so that a contour plot of the current versus position is equivalentto a plot of the magnetic surfaces. Parametric studies of the two methodsare presented, and the effectiveness of each technique is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
