These methods have been applied to comparative risk evaluations,the selection of design features for reactor concepts, the selectionand emphasis of research and development programs, and regulatory discussions.The application of probabilistic methods to reactors which are in theconceptual design stage presents unique data base, modeling, and timingchallenges, and excellent opportunities to improve the final design.We provide here the background and insights on the experience which theUS DOE liquid metal breeder reactor program has had in its applicationof probabilistic methods to the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant project,the Conceptual Design State of the Large Development Plant, and updateson this design. Plans for future applications of probabilistic risk assessmentmethods are also discussed. The US DOE is embarking on an innovativedesign program for liquid metal reactors.</TEXT></DOC>
