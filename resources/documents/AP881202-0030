(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA knows it can't do anything aboutthe weather at its Florida launch site, but the space agencyprobably wishes it didn't have to spend so much time talking aboutit.   Winds, clouds or storms have forced changes in liftoff plans forthe space shuttle eight times, including Thursday's postponement ofthe Atlantis launch. Three times, Florida landings have beencanceled because of weather.   Weather played a role in NASA's worst moment _ the explosion ofChallenger on Jan. 28, 1986, that claimed the lives of sevenastronauts.   The Kennedy Space Center sits on a marshy island that is captiveto the shifting winds, frequent rain and powerful fronts moving infrom the north that keep the coastal weather in a turmoil of change.   The capricious weather has only a minor effect on conventionalaircraft and mattered little in the early days of NASA, whenunmanned rockets could easily cut through clouds or strong winds ontheir way into space.   But the shuttle, which goes higher and faster, then returns toEarth as a glider, is more sensitive to the forces of nature.Launch-area winds as low as 20 miles an hour can keep the shuttle onEarth. High-altitude winds, smashing into the shuttle as it racesupward, can be violent enough to destroy the spacecraft. It was thethreat of such winds that forced the postponement Thursday.   Weather rules regulating the launch of the shuttle fill a thickvolume, and it takes a small army of forecasters and observers tomonitor the subtle atmospheric changes that can affect the spaceship.   Some of the rules are new, created after sub-freezingtemperatures are thought to have contributed to the failure of asolid-fuel rocket booster that caused the Challenger accident.   Shuttle flights depend not only on the weather in Florida, butalso on conditions thousands of miles away. Since the spacecraftcould be forced to land on emergency runways in Europe, North Africaor California, bad weather at those distant sites can force a launchdelay.   Atlantis commander Robert L. Gibson twice suffered through aweather delay in his first space command. His 1986 flight onColumbia was postponed once because of poor weather in Moron, Spain,an emergency landing site, and once because of heavy rains on thelaunch pad.   After he got in orbit, Gibson three times made plans to land inFlorida, and three times was disappointed. He finally ended hisColumbia flight with a touchdown on the desert lake bed at EdwardsAir Force Base in California, where weather is seldom a problem.   NASA has decided for the immediate future to land all shuttles atEdwards.</TEXT></DOC>
