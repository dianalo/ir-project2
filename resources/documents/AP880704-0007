It was not known whether the program had been deliberatelyintroduced at the agencies or brought in accidentally, but NASAofficials have asked the FBI to enter the case, the Times reportedin Monday's editions.   Damage to government data was limited, but files were destroyed,projects delayed and hundreds of hours spent tracking theelectronic culprit, according to the newspaper.   The rogue program destroyed files over a five-month periodbeginning in January at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. SentencingCommission, the Times reported.   The program, known as a ``virus,'' infected close to 100computers at NASA facilities in Washington, Maryland and Florida,NASA officials said.   David Lavery, a senior computer systems scientist with NASA,said loss of information was isolated and limited to personalcomputers.   The virus was designed to sabotage computer programs atElectronic Data Systems, a private company in Dallas, said BillWright, a company spokesman. The program did little damage, he said.   It is one of at least 40 programs in this country designed toconceal their presence and replicate themselves into computermemory banks, experts told the Times.   The virus programs often lie dormant before exploding at aparticular time or on contact with a specific computer program.</TEXT></DOC>
