On the New York Mercantile Exchange, May-delivery West Texas Intermediate, which soared $1.02 a barrel Monday, gained another 20 cents yesterday to close at $18.09. Refined products rose, with May heating oil closing at 48.91 a gallon, up 1.03 cents, and unleaded gasoline rising 1.12 cents, to 52.07 cents a gallon. In late European trading, North Sea Brent crude was quoted at $16.50 a barrel, up 25 cents, and up 90 cents from Friday.    With this week's news that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will sit down on April 23 with several non-OPEC exporters to discuss output cuts, futures prices have soared.    &quot;The futures market is doing what futures markets usually do&quot; -- anticipating a future event -- said Donald Morton, energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Boston.    Prices will fall if the meeting is disappointing, analysts said.    Mehdi Varzi, London-based oil analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said at an energy seminar sponsored by the firm that he doesn't expect any concrete moves at the OPEC meeting to curtail production. The meeting will precede the cartel's full 13-member meeting in June.    Instead of progress, &quot;the Saudis will try very hard to sow some discord during the meeting so as to string the market along until June,&quot; Mr. Varzi said. He said this is because the kingdom, while it doesn't want prices to collapse, is reluctant to cut its output. Keeping the market glued to the promise of the June meeting will be enough to support prices, he said.    Still, Mr. Varzi said that even if the next few weeks' developments are disappointing, he doesn't anticipate prices to collapse to the first-quarter lows of near $15 a barrel, as some analysts predict. That is because world oil demand may be rising faster than anticipated, he said.    Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster, said several aspects of the OPEC developments have been misinterpreted by bullish traders. For one, he said, the announcement of a meeting is probably an attempt by all oil exporters to buoy prices so that there is a higher ceiling from which to start offering discounts.    &quot;The perfect analogy is auto manufacturers that raise prices of cars every year. Then dealer discounts start from a higher price,&quot; Mr. Higby said.    Energy Security Analysis Inc., a Washington, D.C., consultant, said it believes another bullish factor was its monthly report of European oil inventories. The report showed a substantial decrease in European crude and products stockpiles in March compared with February, probably because of increased refinery runs.    Mirroring Monday's moves by USX Corp.'s Marathon Petroleum unit, Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit and Texaco Inc., several oil companies raised the so-called posted price they will pay for West Texas Intermediate by 50 cents, to $16.50 a barrel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Prices again declined on soft demand for the metal. May-delivery copper fell 4.55 cents a pound, to 95.65 cents, for a two-day loss of 9.15 cents. &quot;Buyers are standing aside on the belief that prices can go even lower,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. That is a change from late last year, when they were more aggressive, he said, even though there hasn't been any major change in the market. In the absence of demand, technical selling is depressing prices, he said. One trade source said that as long as visible inventories -- those in warehouses of the London Metals Exchange and New York's Commodity Exchange -- remain low, the market is going to be volatile. &quot;It's been known for some time that the market for electical wire for construction is soft, and supplies may have built up,&quot; he said. &quot;But, on balance, copper is still a market that can go either way on any given day.&quot;    LIVESTOCK andamp; MEATS: Cattle prices dropped as some traders got nervous about whether more-than-expected young cattle were placed on feedlots in this year's first quarter. On feedlots, cattle are fattened for slaughter. Several weeks ago, some analysts anticipated fewer first-quarter placements than in the year-earlier quarter. That would have contributed to a tightening supply of fed cattle, and thus higher cash prices. However, some analysts are beginning to detect a rise in March placements, which might generate an overall increase for the quarter. &quot;It now appears that we placed as many cattle on feed this first quarter as last year's,&quot; said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago. &quot;The market is a little nervous about it.&quot; Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill., said the rally in livestock prices might have spurred some feedlot operators to take in more cattle. The Agriculture Department is slated to release its monthly cattle feedlot census next week.    STOCK INDEXES: Stock-index futures finished higher. The market got a lift from the stronger dollar and the rebound in bonds, analysts said. Stock futures also were buoyed by a round of program trading. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index contract for June settlement rose 1.35 points, to 272.55. The Treasury-bond contract for June was up 3/8, to 90 11/16. Trading started on a tentative note, but moved up with the dollar and the bond market. Analysts said many traders are awaiting tomorrow's trade figures and results of today's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven, which are likely to be announced tomorrow. </TEXT></DOC>
