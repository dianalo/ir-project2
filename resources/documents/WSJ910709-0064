New Jersey's new budget calls for cutting $90 million inpayroll costs. Gov. Florio says 7,500 jobs will go, butunions insist the plan will cost only 2,200 jobs. The statedropped 1,500 jobs in the previous fiscal year. ConnecticutGov. Weicker would eliminate 1,100 jobs, his state's firstlayoffs in 16 years. But more cuts may be coming, as workerswithdraw $340 million in offered concessions.</LP><TEXT>   Gov. Cuomo plans to shrink the New York force by 18,000,while Michigan, which laid off 2,000 employees last year,will cut 3,000 more jobs by early retirements. Californiawill push salary trimming; Gov. Wilson says he'll take a 5%cut, and the legislature mulls unpaid leaves. Washington andUtah will restrain pay rises.   Rand Condell of the Public Employees Federation in NewYork lost an election due to his ties with the Cuomo regime,political observers say.                                                                                                          THE TEAMSTERS will try to shake federal control of theirconventions.   Chafing under the government's tight grip on their Junegathering, delegates voted to revert to having local officersserve as convention delegates. And they decided to have unionmembers nominate national officers by petition. Under a 1989federal consent decree, the rank-and-file picked this year'sdelegates, who nominated officers in secret conventionvoting.   Union officials say the changes will eliminate anyconvention role for the feds; they argue that the 1959Landrum-Griffin union reform law says the government's onlyinterest in conventions is to supervise elections. U.S.attorneys insist they won't consider changing the consentdecree until after Teamster elections in December. But unionofficials will go to court soon, contending the delegateshave spoken.                                                                                                          SOME TEAMSTERS NOMINEES face federal misconduct charges.   On presidential front-runner R.V. Durham's slate, MichaelRiley is faulted by a federal investigator for failing to actagainst a union official charged with corruption and forcollecting car-expense money while using an all-expense paidunion car; he explains he stayed aloof because he would haveto judge the official later and had separate cars forseparate duties. Candidate Don West scoffs at charges heillegally solicited employer contributions for a retirementdinner and failed to report a bank account for the dinner. Hesays he just let his name be used on the solicitationletterhead.   On the Walter Shea ticket, Joseph Trerotola denies heviolated his duties by deliberately failing to act againstofficials charged with involvement in organized crime andtheir refusing to testify. And Dan Darrow, an Ohio localofficial, denies that his conviction for participating in a1969 gun battle brought reproach on the union.   Daniel Ligurotis, Shea-slate secretary-treasurercandidate, boasts of his contempt citation for trying to freelocals from the consent decree.                                                                                                          THEY BOOED WOMEN speakers louder and more often than menat the Teamsters confab, despite the union's 30% femalemembership. They booed a President Bush video. And they booeda speech by union President William McCarthy, who earlier hadkilled a planned tribute to himself because he feared boos.                                                                                                          SKINNING THE CAT: Faced with state layoffs, the ServiceEmployees union pushes for a Connecticut income tax. It alsoseeks such changes as tax boosts, closing corporate taxloopholes or a wider sales tax in California, New York andPennsylvania.                                                                                                          INTO THE FAST LANE: The United Auto Workers and GeneralMotors form UAW-GM Team Motorsports to study how the unioncan join in GM's high-profile racing efforts. The UAW mightfield a team in a UAW-made race car.                                                                                                          POPULARITY CLIMBS for &quot;reimbursement accounts,&quot; into whichemployees may set aside pretax dollars for certain health andchild-care bills. Fully 60% of 1,016 employers polled byconsultant Foster Higgins will offer the benefit by 1992, upfrom 50% last year and 41% in 1989, even though IRS rulesrequire them to fully fund accounts all year.                                                                                                          &quot;BACKDRAFT&quot; OR NOT, firefighting crews face cuts.   The movie is helping fan interest in firefighting, theFire Fighters union says. Paul Schermann, a Pittsburgh unionofficial, thinks it will help recruiting for volunteers. Butofficials in Pittsburgh, Dallas and Denver don't yet see anysurge of firefighting zeal sparked by the film.   Meantime, budget woes hurt crew hiring. Binghamton, N.Y.,officials chose pay cuts in order to avoid eliminatingemergency medical and ambulance services. The Dallasdepartment slows hiring, as it faces a possible 5%-to-15%budget cut; the union warns that some cuts could compromisefire fighting.                                                                                                          Denver fire chief Richard Gonzalez says &quot;Backdraft&quot;suffers from &quot;testosterone poisoning;&quot; he fears it'll scareoff women firefighters.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: The Maytag repairman? U.S. Judge DavidEdelstein, who's overseeing the Teamsters, traveled from NewYork to Orlando, Fla., for the union's convention, but no oneneeded a ruling. . . . Surgeons specializing incardiovascular, neurosurgery and colon-rectal areas are thehighest paid doctors, a survey of 73 health careorganizations by consultant William M. Mercer shows.</TEXT></DOC>
