An officialsaid 17 people were killed.   Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in theconservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac of France, saidthe dead included two members of the assault team and 15 kidnappers.   He also said two members of the assault team were seriouslyinjured.   Pons said the hostages were freed after ``a particularly violentbattle'' in the nearly seven-hour assault on a network of caves inOuvea, an island off the northeast coast of New Caledonia.   The assault team attacked the cave with tear gas, forcing mostof the approximately 30 kidnappers out, Pons told a news conferenceafter returning from Ouvea, where he had traveled for the operation.   The hostages freed themselves from their handcuffs before theattack after a key was smuggled to them by Capt. Philippe Legorjus,chief of an anti-terrorism squad.   Legorjus had been captured during earlier hostage negotiationswith the separatists, then freed to act as an go-between withFrench authorities. Legorjus made several trips to and from thecaves during negotiations and was told that the hostages would bekilled if he did not return.   Legorjus also smuggled to the caves two pistols with whichhostages defended themselves during the attack.   ``Profiting from the smoke created by tear gas bombs, thehostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of thecave,'' Pons said.   Police said the injured were taken to a hospital in Noumea,capital of this island territory 1,300 miles northeast of Australia.   In Paris, Defense Minister Andre Giraud said in a televisioninterview that the kidnappers' chief was among those killed.   Giraud told French radio that the attack was ordered by Chirac,with approval from President Francois Mitterrand, when negotiationswith the kidnappers stalled.   ``The situation inside the cave had become extremelydangerous,'' Giraud said. ``In any case, it was entirelyintolerable that representatives of the forces of order might beheld hostage.''   Jean-Marie Tjibaou, president of the Kanak Socialist NationalLiberation Front, the main Melanesian separatist organization, saidthe operation was ``a hard blow for the Kanak people.''   ``This will not stop the determination of the Kanak people intheir demand for independence,'' Tjibaou told The Associated Pressby telephone from his home in Hienghene at the northern end of NewCaledonia.   Asked if he expected to be arrested, Tjibaou replied: ``It'salways possible. It would be completely logical, since thegovernment thinks there is no political claim but only a terroristband.''   Authorities had imposed a near total news blackout for severaldays, cut communications with Ouvea and would not allow journaliststo go there.   The Melanesian kidnappers had demanded negotiations towardindependence for New Caledonia, the French Pacific island territory.   Fifteen of the gendarmes had been held since they were kidnappedfrom a police station on Ouvea April 22. Four gendarmes were killedin that attack.   Legorjus and seven other hostages were seized April 27 as theysought to negotiate the release of the other hostages.   The militants were demanding that French troops be removed fromOuvea and that a mediator be sent to arrange a referendum onindependence for New Caledonia, a French territory since 1853. Theyalso had demanded the cancellation of elections, which took placeduring scattered violence April 24.   As a result of that election, Mitterrand and Chirac will faceeach other in a presidential runoff election in France on Sunday.New Caledonia has become an issue in the campaign.   Of New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants, 43 percent are nativeMelanesian, known as Kanaks, most of whom desire independence.   European settlers make up 36 percent of the population, with therest Asian and Polynesian. This group generally would prefer toremain part of France.</TEXT></DOC>
