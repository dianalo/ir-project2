Arnold Kephart, 53, who fled to East Germany fearing punishmentafter wrecking an Army truck, said adjustment to U.S. society hasmade him feel a bit like a latter-day Rip van Winkle.   ``The first time I saw one of those,'' Kephart said, pointing toa microwave oven, ``I thought it was a TV. Then someone came along,opened it up, and put food in. I couldn't believe he was puttingfood in the TV.''   In an interview Friday at the home of his brother-in-law, ArloDunbar, Kephart said he regretted his decision to enter EastGermany only a few weeks after settling in Schmalkalind, he townwhere he lived for 30 years.   ``It was like you were locked up all the time. I never reallyever felt at home,'' said the former Army private, who said hetwice unsuccessfully tried to escape the country.   ``I feel like I threw 30 years of my life away,'' he said.   Before his second escape attempt in 1975, Kephart drank ``enoughbeer to get my courage up and so I'd have an excuse if I gotcaught,'' he said.   Three guards grabbed him as he approached the border, beat him,and sent him back to town, Kephart said.   ``After that, I didn't think about trying the border again,''Kephart said.   A year after the escape attempt he met his second wife,Brigitte. She is the mother of Frankie, now 12 and in the UnitedStates with his father, and Kephart's 8-year-old twin daughters,Katharina and Kathleen. He has another child from his firstmarriage in East Germany.   The family lived in a small house, Kephart said. Their diet wasmeager: bread with some bologna-like meat for breakfast, soup andpotatoes for lunch. Dinner was a reprise of breakfast, he said.   ``You could seldom get eggs,'' he said. ``And the meat in thestore, when you could get it, a lot of times had a bad color, likeit was old.''   He said the country he has returned to is a ``different world.''   ``Here, everybody has a phone,'' Kephart noted with amazement ina voice heavy with a German accent.   On returning to the United States last month, the Army arrestedhim at the airport as he was being reunited with relatives. He wasgranted an other-than-honorable discharge a week later.   Kephart, who earned a living driving trucks in East Germany,could not believe the interstate highway system when he saw it. Herecently drove about 50 miles south from here to Rock Port, Mo.,just to test Interstate 29.   He said he is enjoying foods he sorely missed.   ``I always loved chili,'' he said. ``And pork and beans. Theyjust don't have anything like that over there.''   A deal for a television movie of Kephart's life has been closed,according to his attorney, James Martin Davis. He wouldn't revealdetails.   Kephart said he now will be try to rebuild his life in CouncilBluffs, a southwestern Iowa community.   His second marriage ended in divorce in 1988, but he said hewants to remarry Brigitte, bring her and his daughters to theUnited States and work as a truck driver.   He wrote all of this in a letter to his former wife, and nowawaits her reply.</TEXT></DOC>
