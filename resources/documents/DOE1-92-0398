<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0398 </DOCNO><TEXT>The sources, sinks, and transport of PCBs were evaluated in an extensive,two-year study of Siskiwit Lake, located on Isle Royale in Lake Superior.Measurements were obtained for 22 PCB congeners (having from 2 to 9 chlorines) in rain, air, particulate matter, snow, water, sediments, and fish.From the data, the total wet deposition and sediment flux were determined,and the dry particulate flux was estimated by theoretical models. A steady-statemass balance approach of the major sources and sinks was used to estimatethe air-water vapor exchange flux. Wet deposition (vapor and particulate)was the predominant source of these compounds to the lake; dry depositionwas of minor importance. The net vapor flux of most congeners was foundto be from the lake to the atmosphere. This loss was of similar magnitudeas the loss to the bottom sediments. Individual congener behavior wasfound to be related to physical-chemical properties; this provides ameans for predicting the environmental behavior of all 209 individualPCB congeners.</TEXT></DOC>
