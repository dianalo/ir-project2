The language processor does notrequire the complex software of compilers, assemblers, and linkage editorsin order to run Turbo Pascal source code programs. The language processorcan execute Turbo Pascal programs several orders of magnitude fasterthan conventional systems without language orientation. The Turbo Pascallanguage processor closely reflects the data and control constructs ofthe high-level language. The language processor is designed as a pipelinedprocessor in which several dedicated hardware processors are operatingat the same time. Other innovations of the language processor are alsodescribed. The language processor can make a better use of current developmentsin Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology.</TEXT></DOC>
