The best indicator of thesubtle presence is that no one, especially not the people who know, will talkabout it.;    This year's show at Radio City Music Hall returns to New York --never the most stable of environments -- at a turbulent time. The Persian Gulfwar seems on the brink of a major land battle, and Iraqi President SaddamHussein has threatened world-wide terrorism against the coalition of nationsthat opposes him.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SECURITY TIGHTER AT N.Y. GRAMMY SHOWGRAMMY AWARDS UPS SECURITY AT N.Y. SHOW  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     Confidence reigns;  Against that potentially fearsome backdrop, securitybefore, during and after the three-hour broadcast is among the top logisticalconcerns for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, sponsor ofthe Grammy Awards.;    Said NARAS President Michael Greene: &quot;We know what todo and we've hired the best people in the world to do it, so we feel confidentthat there are not going to be any problems.&quot;;    Greene's confidence seemsjustified in light of the uneventful history of the awards show. There havebeen no major breaches of security in the past, only a breach of decorum whensinger Grace Jones flashed her chest while presenting an award a few yearsago. This year, however, the Grammy Awards show is unlike any other.;   Perhaps a billion viewers;  This year is only the fifth time the Grammys haveventured to New York. More than 1,000 musicians and record-company executivesare in town for the ceremony; many no doubt made aware of heightened airportsecurity.;    More people will see Wednesday night's broadcast than any showin the 33-year history of the awards, Greene said. It will be televised liveor delayed in 65 countries, with a potential audience of more than 1 billionpeople -- including soldiers in Saudi Arabia watching the Armed ForcesNetwork.;    With up to 20 percent of the world tuned in, a terrorist attackwould receive immediate and widespread coverage. It would be the kind of freepublicity that security experts and NARAS officials are trying to avoid.;   &quot;We can't say exactly what kind of security we are going to have because thatdefeats the purpose of having it,&quot; NARAS spokesman Ian Dove said. &quot;There isdefinitely a heightened awareness of security these days, but that's a generalrule with any highly visible show. The people at the Oscars will probably dothe same thing.&quot;;    According to security-industry experts, that means thestage and auditorium will doubtless receive heavy attention from agents, somepossibly using bomb-sniffing dogs, up until the last moments before showtime.;    Looking for bombs;  &quot;There has to be a series of pre-performancechecks for the obvious things such as bombs and places where people couldhide,&quot; said Robert Kneip, senior vice president of Wackenhut Corp., whichprovides security internationally for major events and corporations. Althoughhis company is not involved with Grammy Awards security, Kneip agreed todescribe common security procedures for such a large event.;    If the patternof past shows holds, a discreet contingent of jacketed guards may flank thebuilding's main entrance, while all other doors are guarded by at least one ortwo guards.;    Police officers will always be close at hand, regardless ofwhat happens inside the building. Security outside Radio City Music Hall isthe responsibility of the New York City Police Department, which assigned abigger staff to this year's ceremony than the 1988 show, according to OfficerRalph St. Just. &quot;The last time, we were undermanned. We had a little less than200 officers then, but we're going to have a little over 200 tomorrow.&quot;;   Police do not anticipate any major problems, St. Just said, but plan toreserve a &quot;demonstration area&quot; just in case.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  648  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051208,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
