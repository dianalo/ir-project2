The five sources are electricity, natural gas, No. 2heating oil, propane and kerosene. The representative unit costs of theseenergy sources are used in the Energy Conservation Program for ConsumerProducts established by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amendedby the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, by the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987, and by the National Appliance Energy ConservationAmendments of 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>The representative average unit costs of energycontained in this notice will become effective January 6, 1989, and willremain in effect until further notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Michael J.

L. 94-163), as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (Pub. L. 95-619), by the National Appliance Energy ConservationAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-12), and the National Appliance Energy ConservationAmendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-357) (Act)\1\<NOTE/> requires that the Department of Energy (DOE) prescribe testprocedures for the determination of the estimated annual operating costand other measures of energy consumption for certain consumer product specifiedin the Act. DOE has prescribed test procedures for the major householdproducts listed in section 322(a) of the Act. These test procedures arefound in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\References to the ``Act'' refer to the Energy Policy andConservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation PolicyAct, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 and by theNational Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988.Section 323(b) of the Act requires that the estimated annual operatingcosts of a covered product be computed from measures of energy use in arepresentative average-use cycle and from representative average unit costsof the energy needed to operate such product during such cycle. The sectionfurther requires DOE to provide information regarding the representativeaverage unit costs of energy for use wherever such costs are needed toperform calculations in accordance with the test procedures. Most notably,these costs are used under the Federal Trade Commission appliance labelingprogram established by section 324 of the Act and in connection with advertisementsof appliance energy use and energy costs which are covered by section 323(c)of the Act.DOE last published representative average unit costs of residential energyfor use in the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products on December23, 1987. (52 FR 48563). Effective January 6, 1989, the cost figures publishedon December 23, 1987, will be superseded by the cost figures set forthin this notice.DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) has developed the 1989 representativeaverage unit costs of electricity, natural gas and No. 2 heating oil foundin this notice. These costs were taken from EIA's October 1988 <T3>Short-Term Energy Outlook (Outlook), </T3>DOE/EIA-0202 (88/4Q), whichforecasts the retail cost of selected energy products based on changesin world oil prices, wellhead natural gas prices, seasonal patterns inretail prices and established trends in margins and operating expenses.The development of these costs is discussed in detail in the October 1988issue of this report, which is EIA's quarterly publication of historicaland forecasted energy consumption and prices. The costs appear in Table5 of EIA's <T3>Outlook. </T3>Copies of this report are available at the National EnergyInformation Center, Forrestal Building, Room 1F-048, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-8800.In the cases of kerosene and propane, the 1989 representative average unitcosts found in this notice were developed by other means since EIA's <T3>Outlook </T3>does not provide a forecast of the retail costs of thesefuels. However, historical refiner prices for kerosene and propane areavailable from another EIA publication, <T3>Petroleum Marketing Monthly </T3>(PMM), DOE/EIA-0380. Referring toTable 2 of the July 1988 issue of the <T3>PMM, </T3>DOE obtained refiner average sales prices to end users forkerosene and propane for 1987. To forecast a 1989 representative averageunit cost for kerosene, DOE made the assumption that the percentage changein 1989 from the 1987 annual average (last complete year of available data)for No. 2 heating oil prices to residential customers (which can be calculatedfrom Table 5 of the <T3>Outlook</T3>) would be applied to kerosene. Propane prices were assumedto change at the same rate as the residential price of natural gas (whichalso can be calculated from Table 5 of the <T3>Outlook</T3>). Refiner prices to end users for kerosene and propanewere used since, of the comparable recent data available, these are believedto be most representative of prices to residential consumers.The 1989 representative average unit costs stated in Table 1 are providedpursuant to section 323(b)(4) of the Act and will become effective January6, 1989. They will remain in effect until further notice.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, November 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
