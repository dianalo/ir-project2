(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackon returned to his boyhoodhometown as he headed down the home stretch to the Super Tuesdayshowdown, buoyed by another strong showing in a northern state.   ``Our message continues to win,'' the Democratic presidentialcandidate said when he learned Tuesday night that he had finishedsecond in Vermont's ``beauty contest'' primary.   Jackson was surrounded by family, staff and reporters enjoying ahome-cooked Southern style meal when word of his showing reachedhim.   ``We have found the common chord that is linking the Americanpeople where they are in Iowa or Maine or New Hampshire ofMinnesota or South Carolina,'' he said.   Jackson is hoping that the inroads he has made among whitevoters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maine _ all stateswith 1 percent or less black voting age population _ will continuein the March 8 series of primaries across 20 states, most of themin the South.   Jackson is expected to run well on Super Tuesday, especially inthe deep South with its heavy black population. But the campaignalso is targeting the working class, students, gays and otherminorities.   Jackson acknowledged upon arriving in South Carolina, whichholds its primary Saturday, that the South is different than thestates that have voted so far. But he said, ``I'm a son of theSouth ... I know the South and its ways.''   He said his message _ attacking multinational corporations andappealing to the economically oppressed _ would remain the same ashe campaigns in the South.   Arriving at the Greenville airport, Jackson highlighted theplight of textile workers who have been hurt by U.S. industrytaking its operations overseas.   He said that when he was a youth, Greenville was the textilecapital of the world and was filled with mills, now closed down.   Jackson said the customs laws must be enforced to keep foreignproducts from entering the country illegally, and he called foradjustment of the exchange rates by South Korea and Taiwan so thosenations cannot receive inflated prices on their goods.   Jackson also defended his leadership qualifications which havecome under attack from Democratic rival Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr.because Jackson has never held an elected or appointive governmentpost.   Speaking to a Baptist convention at the Springfield BaptistChurch where his mother sang in the choir when he was a boy,Jackson repeated his oft-stated claim that he knows the Americanpeople better than any other candidate. He also gave a litany offoreign leaders he has met, labor strikes he has mediated and civilrights causes he has championed.   ``I'm not propped up by aides,'' he said, adding that he canspeak to the poor because ``I was born in the underclass.''   Earlier, in Washington, Jackson met with the South Africanambassador to protest Pretoria's new clampdown of anti-apartheidfactions and arrest of dissident religious leaders, includingArchbishop Desmond Tutu.   Jackson told a news conference later that the ambassador, PietG.J. Koornhof, asked for a follow-up meeting with Rep. RonaldDellums, D-Calif., who attended the meeting and who is sponsoringlegislation on sanctions against South Africa because of itsapartheid policy of racial separation.   The ambassador did not join Jackson and Dellums at the newsconference.   Jackson said U.S. corporations and banks should be ordered toleave South Africa. And he called on the Reagan administration toconvene special United Nations Security Council sessioninternational support for full sanctions against Pretoria.   He also called for suupport of the frontline states around SouthAfrica and aid in constructing trade corridors so Zimbabwe andZambia would not be dependent on South African trade routes.   He said he had phoned national security adviser Colin Powell andurged that the issue be raised with North Atlantic TreatyOrganization allies.   Jackson said Powell told him there was ``a sense of outrage'' inthe administration about the recent crackdown in South Africa andthat Reagan would so state if the matter was brought up at the NATOmeeting.</TEXT></DOC>
