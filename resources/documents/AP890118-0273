The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed anaccount in the Wall Street Journal that said SEC negotiators madethe demand in talks late last week, toughening an earlier requestthat Drexel only move its supervision authority over the division tothe firm's New York headquarters.   The new condition is important because Drexel must settle withthe SEC as part of a broader plea bargain deal reached Dec. 21 withthe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Under that deal, the firm willplead guilty to six fraud felonies and pay a record $650 million infines and restitution.   Drexel's high-yield ``junk bond'' division is considered thefirm's most profitable operation. Dismantling and moving it to NewYork could cripple Drexel's renowned prowess in the $175 billionmarket for junk bonds, commonly used to finance takeovers and thegrowth of small and midsize companies.   The new SEC demand came at a time when many Drexel high-yieldbond traders already are upset over the firm's decision to reach aplea bargain with the government rather than fight longstandingcharges of securities fraud that grew out of the Ivan Boesky insidertrading scandal more than two years ago.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the SECnegotiations or whether they were close to resolution.   But he said the firm ``does not believe the high-yield bonddepartment can be successfully mmoved to New York since any effortto do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage tothe high-yield market.''   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the Drexelnegotiations. The agency's policy is to refrain from commenting onany impending enforcement matter.   The high-yield department was moved from New York to Californiain 1978 by its architect Michael Milken, a senior Drexel financierwho is expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges.   Unlike Drexel, Milken has continued to assert his innocence buthas been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain.   The SEC accused Drexel, Milken and three other senior aides ofwide-ranging fraud in a civil enforcement action filed in September.Most of the accusations were linked to Drexel's relationship withBoesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidencein exchange for lenient treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
