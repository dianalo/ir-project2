The agencyis taking this action to enable enforcement of the blood CGMP's in themanufacture of unlicensed blood products that are device components ordevice raw materials. The products were subject to the blood CGMP's untilthe Medical Device Amendments of 1976 broadened the definition of a ``device,''with the inadvertent effect of removing these products from the applicabilityof these regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Joseph Wilczek, Center for BiologicsEvaluation and Research (HFB-130), Food and Drug Administration, 8800 RockvillePike, Bethesda, MD 20892, 301-295-8188.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23414), FDA proposedto reissue the blood CGMP's (21 CFR Part 606) under section 520(f) of theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360j(f)) as theseregulations apply to blood products that are device components or deviceraw materials. The blood CGMP's apply to all blood products other thanthose that are device components or device raw materials.The blood CGMP's were intended to apply to all blood banks, transfusionfacilities, plasmapheresis centers, compatibility testing establishments,and any other facility which collects, processes, or stores blood and bloodcomponents, regardless of whether the components are intended for (a) interstateor intrastate commerce or (b) in vitro or in vivo use.Upon enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the act, thedefinition of the term ``device'' in section 201(h) of the act (21 U.S.C.321(h)) was broadened to include several products, formerly regulated as``drugs.'' Among such products are human blood and blood components intendedfor further manufacture into in vitro diagnostics not subject to licensureunder the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(d)). These productsinclude blood, plasma, and serum which are intended for further manufactureinto products such as clinical chemistry controls and control cells forautomated cell counters now regulated as devices under the act.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 22, 1988, FDA proposed to correct thecurrent anomaly in which compliance with the blood CGMP's is not enforceableunder the adulteration provisions in section 501(h) of the act (21 U.S.C.351(h)) for unlicensed blood products that are device components or deviceraw materials, even though these requirements are necessary to ensure thesafety of donors and the safety and effectiveness of manufactured medicaldevice products derived from blood and blood components. FDA proposed toreissue, under section 520(f) of the act, the blood CGMP's as these regulationsapply to blood products that are device components or device raw materials.Section 520(f) of the act is the statutory section that currently authorizesCGMP's for medical devices in 21 CFR Part 820. Pursuant to section 520(f)of the act, FDA's Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committeehad an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment at an open publichearing. The committee unanimously recommended that FDA reissue the bloodCGMP's under section 520(f) of the act to apply to blood and blood componentsused as device components or raw materials for devices. A copy of the advisorycommittee's minutes of this meeting has been placed on file under the docketnumber identified in the brackets at the heading of this final rule andis available from the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and DrugAdministration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.In response to the proposed rule of June 22, 1988, FDA received one letterof comment. The comment completely supported the proposed rule.Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed rule without revision, and isreissuing the CGMP's for blood and blood components (21 CFR Part 606).Blood products that are device components or device raw materials excludedfrom the scope of the device CGMP's under andSection; 820.1 are now subjectto the blood CGMP's in Part 606. Violations of Part 606 involving suchdevice components or raw materials are now subject to enforcement actionunder section 501(h) of the act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(10) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Part 606 of this final rule contains information collection requirementsthat were submitted for review and approval to the Director of the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB), as required by section 3507 of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. The requirements were approved and assigned OMBcontrol number 0910-0116.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment</ITAG>The agency has examined the economic consequences of the final rule andhas determined that it does not require either a regulatory impact analysisas specified in Executive Order 12291, or a regulatory flexibility analysis,as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). The finalrule involves the reissuance of Part 606 of the regulations establishingCGMP's for manufacturers of blood and blood components under section 520(f)of the act. Thus, Part 606 applies to unlicensed blood products that aredevice components or device raw materials.The agency believes that virtually all of the manufacturers of in vitrodiagnostic products that would be subject to the final rule are alreadyin compliance with the blood CGMP's in Part 606. Therefore, the agencyhas determined that the rule is not a major rule as defined in ExecutiveOrder 12291. Further, FDA certifies that the final rule will not have asignificant impact on a substantial number of small entities, as definedin the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 606</ITAG>Blood, Labeling, Laboratories, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 606_CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE FOR BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS</ITAG>Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public HealthService Act, and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Foodand Drugs, the authority citation for 21 CFR Part 606 is revised to readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Secs. 201, 501, 502, 505, 510, 520(f), 701 (21 U.S.C.321, 351, 352, 355, 360, 360j(f), 371) and sec. 301 of Pub.
