 If you alsothink that making slides on your Mac is easy, you're only partly right, butthe good news is that it's getting easier every day.andM;On paper, the process of making a slide from the desktop looksstraightforward (see Figure 1).andP;  You create slides on your Mac, using specialpresentation software such as Microsoft's PowerPoint or Aldus Persuasion(although special software isn't always necessary).andP;  When you're satisfiedwith the presentation you've created, you export it in one of several fileformats -Autographix (AGX), Genigraphics, or PostScript, or as a PICT or aScrapbook file-and send it to a slide-imaging center.andM;The center's software, usually running on a PC, images your slides through aspecial camera called a film recorder (for more information about filmrecorders, see &quot;Graphics on the Slide,&quot; November  89, page 156).andP;  The exposedfilm is processed, cut into slides, mounted, and delivered to you, usuallywithin 24 hours.andP;  In most cases, the slides look like your screen image.andM;The complicating factor is that slide-imaging systems and the Mac speakdrastically different languages.andP;  For a long time, there were few ways totranslate between them; now, however, there are solutions that work prettywell, and PostScript promises even smoother processing in the near future.andM;Which Presentation Progpam?andM;If you're thinking of creating a slide show on your Mac, you've probablyalready read reviews of the major presentation programs: CA-Cricket Presents,MORE, Persuasion (see &quot;The Hidden Persuasion,&quot; also in this issue),PowerPoint, and StandOut.andP;  Although these packages have different strengthsand weaknesses, all are capable of generating artwork for 35mm slides andthey're all increasingly competitive in terms of raw features and ease of use(see the &quot;Presentation Software&quot; sidebar, below, for each of these package'smain features).andM;Presentation programs vary considerably in their feel and working style.andP;  Ifyou don't already own a presentation package, it makes good sense to choosean imaging service center first and ask the staff members which software theyknow best.andP;  It may turn out that you don't need a special program at all.andP;  Ifyou make only a few slides occasionally and don't need the outlining,organizing, or fancy charting functions of a dedicated presentation program,you might be able to use something you already have, such as Claris' MacDrawII.andP;  Among its other virtues, MacDraw 11 generates good PICT files.andM;If your imaging center can take any PICT file, you can also create slideswith programs such as Silicon Beach's SuperPaint or Deneba's UltraPaint orCanvas.andP;  And if your imaging center accepts print-to-disk PostScript files,you can create slides from page-layout programs such as PageMaker andQuarkXPress as well as Illustrator and FreeHand.andP;  In most applications, youcan print a PostScript file to disk by holding down Command-F while clickingon the OK button in the Print dialog box.andM;There are other good reasons for choosing your software and your imagingcenter at the same time.andP;  For one, if you're creating files to be imaged byAutographix or Genigraphics centers, it's wise to use their proprietaryprinter drivers (Mac Chooser documents) when you create slides.andP;  Theseprinter drivers are included in some presentation packages.andP;  PowerPointincludes a copy of the Genigraphics driver, for example, and Persuasionincludes the Autographix driver, AGXit!.andP;  If your software doesn't includeone of these drivers and you want to use an Autographix or Genigraphicscenter, you can probably get the correct driver from the imaging center for afee that is usually deducted from the cost of your first slide order.andP;  Thesedrivers work with all presentation programs, so you're not locked into usingone of the name-brand services if it would be more convenient to use another.andO;Also note that the driver you use has no effect on the quality of yourslides.andM;Most presentation programs work with Autographix and Genigraphics drivers(regardless of whether the drivers are included with the presentationsoftware), and all support exporting files as PICT, Scrapbook, or PostScriptformats that can be imaged on film recorders.andP;  This doesn't mean you havecomplete freedom of choice, however.andP;  Your imaging center can probably acceptonly one or two formats (see Table I to check where each output format isaccepted).andM;To use one of these drivers, put it into your System Folder, and - preferablybefore you begin to create your presentation - select it from the Chooser.andO;The proportions of a slide are different from those of your screen or anoverhead transparency, and the driver determines which proportions you canwork in.andP;  Converting an overhead to a slide or vice versa is not handled verywell by the software - you have to rearrange the elements on each slide - soit's important to work in slide format from the outset.andM;Some imaging centers have more than one way of imaging slides from a Mac.andP;  Acenter affiliated with one of the traditional slide-imaging companies -Autographix, Dicomed (formerly Crosfield Dicomed), Genigraphics, orManagement Graphics - cannot image files made with a competitor's printerdriver.andP;  They may, however, accept PICT or Scrapbook files, on the one hand,or PostScript on the other, as well as their own files.andP;  You have to ask.andM;Choosing a Slide-Imaging CenterandM;No matter how effective your presentation software, you're most likely toproduce good slides if you have a strong working relationship with yourimaging center.andP;  Before making your first slide, talk to - or better yet,visit - a few imaging places.andP;  A good slide house can contribute more to yoursuccess at slide making than any other decision you make.andP;  If you're lucky,you'll find one with an especially capable person (probably known as &quot;theguru&quot;) who understands Mac files, fonts, and film-recorder technology.andP;  Thesegurus see thousands of slides and have a good idea of what works and whatcauses problems.andP;  Follow their advice.andM;It's important to find an imaging center that processes the film and makesthe slides.andP;  Don't choose by price alone.andP;  In fact, a fair price - around $7to $12 per slide-is one of the signs of a competent service bureau withoperators who can take time to answer your questions and help you producehigh-quality slides.andP;  If the prices are too low, they may be rushing jobs outthe door or relying on older film recorders.andP;  If the prices are too high, theplace may be badly managed or it may not be seriously in the imagingbusiness.andP;  Most slide houses accept files on-disk or by modem, returning yourslides by overnight express (for a premium) or by regular mail.andM;Most cities have several imaging centers or slide shops.andP;  You can find themlisted in the telephone directory under headings such as Slides, ComputerGraphics, or Audiovisual Production.andP;  A few are listed in the booklets thatcome with presentation-software packages, but these lists are often out ofdate and not always complete.andP;  Genigraphics has a nationwide toll-freenumber; it routes your files to the closest imaging center.andP;  (See thedirectory in this article for more information on how to find the rightimaging center.andM;Although there are unaffiliated shops, most imaging centers are eitherindependent licensees of Autographix, Dicomed, or Management Graphics, orthey are branches of Genigraphics, which operates its own service centers.andO;To confuse matters further, Autographix also operates its own imagingcenters, which compete (at higher prices, generally) with its licensees.andM;Autographix.andP;  Autographix-based imaging centers are everywhere.andP;  Some arepart of Autographix itself, and some are independent service centers.andP;  Of thelatter, some are  authorized,&quot; which means they've negotiated an exclusiveright to advertise as Autographix imaging centers in a particular city orregion.andP;  You often find the best prices at centers that aren't authorized,because they don't have to pay a fee to Autographix for every slide theyimage.andM;The Autographix printer driver works with all the major presentationprograms, but as with the Genigraphics driver, some users find it trickier touse than systems that work with PICT or Scrapbook files.andP;  There are tradeoffseither way - a system that can make a slide from a PICT or Scrapbook filewon't correct for your errors, but you can have more control while you'reworking.andP;  The Autographix (or Genigraphics) driver maintains the appropriateproportion of your slides, but you may feel as if the program is fightingyou.andP;  (Once you've mastered it, however, it's reliable.)andM;Dicomed.andP;  One of the old-timers in the computer slide business, Dicomedformerly sold dedicated console systems.andP;  Today it sells film recorders andimaging software to independent slide houses.andP;  Dicomed cameras can image PICTor Scrapbook files exported from Persuasion, PowerPoint, and MORE II and 3.0.andM;Genigraphics.andP;  Another of the old-time dedicated slide-making companies,Genigraphics has moved gracefully into desktop slide making.andP;  A Genigraphicsprinter driver comes bundled with PowerPoint, but for $45 (refundable with aslide order), you can buy a &quot;generic&quot; version that works with every Macpresentation package.andP;  This driver includes a useful preview utility calledGeniPeek, which shows you the film-recorder version of your slide (not anapproximation of it created by your presentation software).andP;  GeniPeek is notincluded with the PowerPoint package, but you can use it (and the genericdriver) with PowerPoint as well as with other programs.andP;  All Genigraphicsnetwork imaging centers are served by a toll-free modem line  [800]441-4364), which routes your files to Genigraphics' Memphis facility.andM;Management Graphics.andP;  Before the Mac had color, one of the few relativelyeasy ways to make 35mm slides was with Management Graphics' EasySlider, whichlet users translate and add color to PICT files.andP;  Today's ManagementGraphics-based imaging centers (they're all independent) may offer EasySliderII or RIPit!, a custom version of Freedom of Press Professional.andP;  RIPit!andO;allows a Solitaire film recorder to image print-to-disk PostScript files,including PostScript graphics and any Type I fonts.andM;Visual Business Systems (VBS).andP;  This British vendor of PC-basedslide-production workstations also sells its Output Manager Professional toimaging centers, which lets them image Mac PICT or Scrapbook files onSolitaire film recorders.andP;  VBS also markets Visual Business Systems No.andP;  5, aMac charting program designed for 35mm slides.andM;PostScript is ComingandM;Users are clamoring for PostScript slide-imaging systems.andP;  It's not thatPostScript slides are necessarily of much higher quality than others, butPostScript does have several advantages.andP;  First, it lets you make use of theprecision and flexibility of sophisticated graphics programs such asPageMaker, FreeHand, QuarkXPress, Illustrator, and Photoshop.andP;  In addition,any PostScript fonts that work with LaserWriters, imagesetters, or otherPostScript output devices can work with film recorders.andM;There are also disadvantages to PostScript slide making.andP;  A PostScript fileof a slide may be larger than the same slide output as a PICT file, withlittle or no discernible quality advantage.andP;  With PostScript (as with PICT),each slide becomes a separate file, which makes your presentation hard tokeep track of if it has more than a few slides.andP;  Using the Autographix orGenigraphics driver, or making a Scrapbook, makes it easier to control largeslide shows.andP;  If you don't need special fonts or intricate drawings,PostScript may not be the right solution for your slide show.andM;Film recorders are not PostScript imaging devices any more than Linotronicimagesetters are.andP;  Each type of output device has its own language and musthave your PostScript document interpreted or translated - RIPed (raster-imageprocessed) - before it can create a hard copy.andP;  There are several techniquesfor interpreting PostScript for film recorders.andP;  Adobe's new Emerald RIP isone solution, although manufacturers will have to incorporate it into theirfilm recorders.andP;  Most of the solutions are software - VBS' Output ManagerProfessional, Custom Applications' Freedom of Press for the PC, andManagement Graphics' RIPit! are available for imaging centers.andP;  Freedom ofPress Professional for the Mac, which works with film recorders and otheroutput devices, should be available this fall.andM;Tricks of the TradeandM;Once you have your presentation software and have chosen a slide-imagingservice, there are still a few hurdles to cross before your completed slideshow is in your hands.andP;  The following tips can help you sail through theprocess:andM;Use a color monitor.andP;  If you have a color monitor and a monochrome monitor,boot your Mac with the color one.andM;Select the printer driver before creating slides.andP;  If your software includesa special driver for writing slide files to disk, always go to the Chooserand select it before launching the program.andP;  Converting from another formatis always more difficult than working in slide format from the outset.andM;Avoid side-to-side or diagonal blends.andP;  Film recorders are raster devices,which write images in horizontal lines.andP;  Although your presentation softwaremay make it easy for you to create ramps of graduated color that change inintensity from left to right or even diagonally, the film recorder can take along time to image such a slide.andP;  A ramp that changes from top to bottom, onthe other hand, can run efficiently.andP;  (This doesn't mean you can't have adiagonal blend if you need it, just that it carries a price - literally, ifyour service bureau charges extra for slides that take more than a minute ortwo to image.)andM;Control your fonts.andP;  The only way you can use fonts other than the 11 thatare resident in the LaserWriter Plus is to print PostScript to disk and havethe files translated to film-recorder format by one of the PostScriptinterpreters (such as RIPit!, VBS Output Manager Professional, or Freedom ofPress Professional).andP;  This means you cannot use the Adobe equivalents of theLaserWriter fonts (or any of the named styles) under most circumstances (seethe &quot;Using Fonts in Slides&quot; sidebar).andM;Test your riles before running an important job.andP;  Create a small filecontaining the types of slides you normally use - word slides, pie charts,diagrams, and so on - and send them to any imaging center you're thinking ofusing.andP;  This is also a good way to determine which format you prefer to workwith.andM;Double-check every slide just before exporting your riles.andP;  More mysteriousshifts in type and other elements seem to occur with presentations than withother types of files.andP;  Sometimes PICT files fly apart when you ungroup themin a presentation program -files from Canvas and DeltaGraph seem particularlyprone to this.andP;  If you must rearrange the elements, reassemble and regroupthem; check the slide before processing just to be safe.andM;Future PerfectandM;Only a few years ago, creating a slide show was a big (and very expensive)deal.andP;  We've come a long, long way.andP;  True, it can be confusing in thebeginning, as you struggle to find an imaging center you can work with(possibly the most important decision in the entire process), learn newsoftware, and solve all the little problems that inevitably accompany newundertakings.andP;  But after a couple of slide shows, you'll wonder what all thefuss was about.andM;Kathleen Tinkel is a Connecticut-based graphic designer who writes frequentlyabout computers md design.andP;  She is copublisher of MacPrePress, a weekly faxednewsletter.andM;Presentation SoftwareandM;If you're shopping for a presentation program, start by asking your imagingcenter which software works best with its system it may turn out that youdon't need a special program at all.andP;  Here, briefly, are the major packages'pros and cons.andP;  (For a more detailed look at these programs, see &quot;ThePresentation Pitch,&quot; December 88, page 244, and &quot;The Art of Persuasion andMORE II,&quot; May 89, page 126.)andM;CA-Cricket PresentsandM;Computer Associates' Cricket Presents doesn't have a built-in outliner, butit can automatically make slides from Acta outlines.andP;  It has strong chartingand graphics tools,andM;MOREandM;This descendent of ThinkTank, marketed by Symantec, was originally billed asan  idea processor.&quot; MORE 3.0 emphasizes outlining - in fact, many people whouse MORE as an outlining and organizing program hardly know about itspresentation capabilities.andP;  MORE 3.0 includes the ability to produce charts,a much-needed feature absent from earlier versions.andM;PersuasionandM;One of the two most popular presentation packages  Microsoft's PowerPoint isthe other), Aldus Persuasion is a graceful Swiss army knife of a program.andO;its many templates range from basic to wild and provide lots of inspirationfor your own designs.andP;  It also provides an interactive outliner and competentdrawing and charting tools.andP;  Many service-center operators are familiar withPersuasion and PowerPoint, which may make them better able to support theseprograms than others.andM;PowerPointandM;Microsoft's PowerPoint doesn't have many bells and whistles-no built-inoutliner, no flashy graphics, You can import graphics and outlines only fromThinkTank or the first version of MORE, neither of which is used muchanymore.andP;  Despite these limitations, many service-center operators considerPowerPoint the most reliable and stable of all Mac presentation programs.andM;StandOut !andP;  Letraset's StandOut! focuses on layout, graphics, and typography.andO;It has no outliner, nor can it import outlines from other sources; it doesaccept word-processing documents, however.andP;  StandOut! provides great controlover imported images and type  including a search-and-replace function thatsome layout programs could use).andM;Using Fonts in SlidesandM;If you're used to the WYSIWYG relationship between the Mac screen and a laserprinter for fonts, the hit-or-miss link between your Mac and a film recordercan come as quite a shock.andP;  Your best hope is to follow to the letter thedirections provided with your software and printer driver (if available).andO;Confirm those rules with your service center, and then run test slides thatshow all the fonts in different weights, styles, and combinations.andM;The following tips can help you control the fonts in your slides:andM;* Select any Zapf Dingbats, arid confirm that no style - bold or italic - hasbeen assigned to them, by looking in the Style menu.andP;  it's all too easy toinadvertently assign styles to the bullets when you're styling text.andP;  Thesestyles are not supported for Dingbats, so they won't be obvious on-screen,but having the nonexistent attributes assigned is enough to confuse filmrecorders, When your slides come back, you'll find an n or /or h where youwanted a bullet.andM;* Use only the fonts recommended by your imaging center.andP;  You can't use Adobeversions of the standard font set (the fonts you get with your System disk orLaserWriter) with Genigraphics, Dicomed, Autographix, or some of the otherimaging systems.andP;  The safest procedure is to use a font-management utilitysuch as Suitcase 11 or MasterJuggler.andP;  Make two separate suitcases of thefont sets: one enhanced (Adobe or another version with all the weights andstyles), the other containing your System and LaserWriter fonts plus thelarge screen fonts that come with your presentation software.andP;  Before makinga slide, close the enhanced font set and open the plain one.andP;  If you don'tand you accidentally select, say, B Avant Garde Bold instead of plain AvantGarde (which you then make boldface with the Style menu), the film recorderwill probably substitute another font.andM;* When doing a rush job, use only Times or Helvetica.andP;  Film recorders areless likely to have problems with these basic fonts.andM;* Turn off ATM (Adobe Type Manager) and use screen fonts while working withslides, ATM is designed to create screen fonts from Adobe printer fonts.andO;These fonts don't exactly match the weights and widths of the Apple fontsthat were used as standards for those built in to film recorders.andP;  As aresult, lines of type in the slides may be longer or shorter than what yousaw on the screen, possibly ruining the slide.andM;If you find you're using font sizes for which you have no screen versions,use Specially Software's FontSizer II to create large screen fonts inadditional useful sizes.andP;  You'll need a LaserWriter for this.) Film recorderscreate their fonts on the fly, so any size will be crisp and clear on yourslide, but it's hard to see the type clearly while you're working in thepresentation program.andM;If You Don't Want to Do it Yourself ...andM;If you don't have the time, the resources, or the expertise to create yourown slides, you can always have a slide show designed and produced bypresentation specialists, such as graphic designers or the experts at yourslide-imaging center.andP;  Here are some of the options:andM;Graphic DesignersandM;There are firms that specialize in audiovisual, video, or multimediaproductions, as well as general design studios.andP;  They may use traditionalslide-creating techniques (using mechanicals imaged on precise, motor-drivenstaging cameras), computer graphics  using either high-end dedicated systemsor small computers with off-the-shelf presentation software), photo and videoequipment, or a combination of these techniques.andP;  You would probably use oneof these firms when you needed to present stunning graphics or specialeffects, as their work is labor-intensive and usually very expensive.andM;Imaging CentersandM;Many imaging centers offer custom slide creation from your designs or theirs.andO;Their dedicated computer-graphics systems offer more special effects thandoes the Mac with presentation software, and they run faster.andP;  It's one ofthe best approaches when you need slides in a hurry, and it's a good solutionf or the few tricky slides in a presentation you're producing yourself.andP;  Runout the simple slides from your software, and hand the more difficult ones toyour imaging center's slide-production staff.andP;  They'll be able to matchcolors and type styles exactly, because they're outputting the rest of yourjob on the same equipment.andM;Management Graphics' Quick ChartandM;Even if you're on a budget, you can have slides - simple ones, at least- madewithout much effort.andP;  Management Graphics-based imaging centers may offerQuick Chart, a menu-driven slide-creation system.andP;  You use your Macintosh, amodem, and any telecommunications program to call in to the center.andP;  You thenselect the slide type (text, pie chart, and so on), enter text or values forcharts, and let the remote system do the rest.andP;  The imaging center storesyour basic format, including background and text colors; merges it with thedata you transmit; and usually turns the slide around overnight.andP;  (TABULARDATA OMITTED)</TEXT></DOC>
