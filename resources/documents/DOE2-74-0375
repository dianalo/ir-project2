Following are the results.(1) CH self-emission images of high quality were obtained. (2) Sensitivity,S/N ratio, and accuracy of OH self-emission were improved by replacingthe image intensifier with that having a high sensitivity for ultravioletzone. (3) As for nonluminous flames, CH and C{sub 2} self-emission imageswith low background light were obtained by using only a small zone interferencefilter without operation involving different images.
