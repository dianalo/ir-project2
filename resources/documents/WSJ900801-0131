Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/01/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><IN>SAVINGS AND LOANS, THRIFTS, CREDIT UNIONS (SAL)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The House, anticipating voter anger over theexpanding savings-and-loan mess, overwhelmingly approvedlegislation aimed at invigorating the investigation andprosecution of thrift-related crime.   The bill, which passed 424-4, would increase maximumprison terms for Sandamp;L offenses and would make it a federalcrime to conceal assets from the receiver of a failed thriftor to obstruct a government examiner. The legislation alsowould authorize greatly increased funding over the next threeyears to hire hundreds of additional investigators andprosecutors specifically to handle fraud cases involvingfinancial institutions.</LP><TEXT>   The bill includes provisions that would vastly expand thegovernment's civil authority to freeze or take over assets ofthose suspected of Sandamp;L fraud.   Focusing on the imminent summer recess and election-yearconstituent meetings, representative after representativerose to declare that the bill would help &quot;put the Sandamp;L crooksin jail.&quot;   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who caught some of hiscolleagues by surprise when he hastily introduced the measureunder a suspension of normal House procedures, called it &quot;aneffective blueprint&quot; to &quot;bring Sandamp;L criminals to justice.&quot;   In fact, none of the bill's criminal provisions wouldapply retroactively. That means that the increased prisonterms and new categories of federal crimes couldn't be usedagainst anyone associated with the Sandamp;L debacle of the 1980s.Moreover, the bill would create redundant criminal statutescovering acts already prosecutable under existing law,according to Justice Department officials and defenselawyers.   Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), one of the fourdissenters in the vote, complained that the measure hadn'tbeen sufficiently debated and was being rushed through theHouse because of &quot;election-year fears.&quot; Lawmakers, hecontended, &quot;are very zealously eager to prove that we want toget these crooks in jail.&quot;   The Senate has approved Sandamp;L-related enforcement provisionswith goals similar to those of the House bill but somedifferences in the mechanics. The Bush administration hasbacked some of the congressional proposals but stronglyopposes a provision in the House bill that would create abipartisan investigative commission to study the causes ofthe thrift crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
