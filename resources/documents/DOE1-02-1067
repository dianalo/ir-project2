<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-1067 </DOCNO><TEXT>Evaluated fission-product yield and decay data have been used to describe105 delayed neutron precursors explicitly in point reactor kinetics calculations.Results calculated for {sup 235}U thermal fission show that rod-dropreactivity values obtained from kinetics calculations with 6-group precursordata are considerably higher than those calculated with explicit delayed-neutronprecursor data. The calculated kinetics associated with positive reactivitysteps are significantly different.</TEXT></DOC>
