Our company standard is PROFS and we have aLarge All-In -I and VMSmail community that wili not convert.&quot;andM;The reasons for this quick progression are obvious to MIS:andM;* PROFS is from IBM, it works, it has thousands of users, and it is&quot;scalable&quot;.andP;  This means it is certrally manageable by MIS, and requires thesame number of support people to service 100 or 1000 users.andM;* &quot;All-In-1 is just PROFS from Digital so I can understand and put up withit.&quot; This is often heard just after an interview with a client who sayssomething that sounds like &quot;Id rather fight than switch.&quot;andM;Of course there are many mail and documcnt products that we would like toconnect, in the interest of integration.andP;  However, the 80/20 rule quicklyleads us back to PROFS, All-In-1, and VMS mail.andP;  OnwardsandM;Here is an outline, with comments, of the basic mail and document exchangeapproaches in DEC-IBM envronments.andP;  Space does not permit detaileddiscussions of each product, but the basic approaches are: 1.andP;  The &quot;ALL mall&quot;ApproachandM;This approach attempts to make any mainl/document system or &quot;user agent&quot; talkto one another &quot;transparently&quot;.andP;  The premier example of this approach isSoftSwitch, offered by SoftSwitch, Inc. of Wayne, PA.andP;  This product supportsIBM PROFS, DISOSS, DEC All-In-1, VMSmail, HPDesk, MCIMail, Wang's OFFICE andMAILWAY Alliance and OIS, Novell's Coordinator, 3 Comms's 3+Mail, and others.andO;IBM's recently announced Integrated Office Vision is basically the same idea.andM;This type of solution tends to bc very good but expensive.andP;  The majoradvantage of this approach is that it is &quot;enterprise wide&quot; and breaks downthe traditional separation between thc &quot;corporate network&quot; and the LANcommunity.andP;  However, it is &quot;overkill&quot; compared to other DEC-IBM onlyproducts.andP;  Thc SoftSwitch Central concept is proprietary, but thcrc are plansto support the X.400 standard in the near future.andP;  (Editor's note: SoftSwitchrcccntly announced certification for connectivity between its X.400 gatewayand Dialcom's Path finder/X.400 product.)andM;&quot;Those who can afford this approach bave already done it.&quot; 2.andP;  The PC LANMailandM;ApproachandM;Most IAN vendors offcr some son of mail facility as a value-added componentto their LAN system.andP;  The logic here is simple but flawed.andP;  &quot;The Work Groupwho participates on the LAN spends 90% of its time communicating with otherWork Group members.andP;  The LAN mail supports thc Work Group at little or nocost and therefore saves the company a large incremental cost in servicingthe remaining 10% of the communications load.andP;  This approach may haveeconomic significance but it ignores tcchnology/architecture issues.andM;This approach docs nothing to solve thc DEC-IBM issue.andM;&quot;Advocating this approach is not the way to more points with MIS.&quot; 3.andP;  TheTCP/IP ApproachandM;(The Poor Man's All mail) This approach is common in aerospace, defensecontracts, and research shops whcrc the requirement is for interoperabilityamong many different types of systems and where DEC-IBM is a subset of thosetypcs.andP;  Basically this approach accepts the severe functional limitations ofTCP/IP's Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) as the cost of offering mailfacilities to anyone who wants it.andM;This is possible because of the wide availability of TCP/IP software foralmost any computing platform.andP;  TCP/ IP is rarely used in DEC-IBMenvironments to provide mail service because commercial users tend to havemorc homogeneous installations (read IBM and a little DEC) and they have beenspoiled by products like PROFs and AllIn-1.andP;  4.andP;  The DEC ApproachandM;Some History....andM;For sometime, DEC's Mailbus/Message Router offering has included VAX MessageRouter SNADS.andP;  This allowed All-In-1 to communicate messages and revisable orfinal form documents to DISOSS/370.andP;  Using the 370 SNA host as a gateway S/3Xand 5520 DISOSS can talk to the VAX as wcll.andP;  The fact that almost no oneuses DISOSS/370 is bit of a hitch.....also DECnet/SNA Gateway hardware andsoftware must be installed on the VAX side.andP;  This can get costly.andO;Today.......andM;As of Fourth Quarter 1988, this DEC approach is almost bearable with theintroduction of VAX Message Router PROFS (MR/P).andP;  This product docs exactlywhat you want it to do and it does it well.andP;  The hitch?andM;First, you must bc an SNA shop.andP;  Forget RSCS, Bi-sync.andP;  You must be &quot;SNA allthe WAYandM;Second, you need to install thc DECnct/SNA Gateway or its software equivalentVMS/SNA ($$).andM;Third, you must make your participating VAX systems Mcssagc Router nodes.andO;This is approximately thc samc as making a commitment to DISOSS in IBM terms(morc $$).andM;Fourth, you must be prepared to maintain manually, a directorycross-referonce table so Message Routers 31 -byte address and the 8-byte IBMaddress can be mapped across the network.andM;My conclusion? If you have a high volume of revisable form documcnt trafficand can pay the price, NIIVP is for you.andP;  5.andP;  The &quot;I'm going to do seriousDEC-IBM Integration so Mail would be nice&quot; ApproachandM;If you are serious about doing DECIBM integration you 'Will want to movemegabyte files around, have full screen terminal emulation both ways, and dotask-to-task program communications among other things.andP;  You will get PROFSto All-In-1 in the package.andP;  However, it's an expensive package.andP;  Thc premierproducts that supply this functionality are the Interlink DEC-IBM Gateway andthe FlexLINK/Intel FASTPATH combination, These high-performance (channelattached) gateway products have no major drawbacks in the way they facilitatemail/document products, except price.andP;  6.andP;  The &quot;Saturday AfternoonandM;and $10,000&quot; ApproachandM;This approach is implemented as JNet from Joiner Associates, Inc.andP;  JNet runsonly on the VAX and is quite inexpensive.andP;  However, since it is licensed perVAX it may not be cost effective in a network situation.andP;  JNet makes the VAX,look like a Network Job Entry (NJE) node to IBM and is therefore supported inDOS/VSE, VM and MVS environmcnts using Power, RSCS and SNA communicationssubsystems respectively.andM;In mail and document terms, JNet routes message traffic as files.andP;  This meansthat All-In-1 and PROFS can exchange &quot;notes&quot;.andP;  The drawback to this approachis that all documents must be final form.andM;If PROFS to All-In-1 is your primary requirement and you do not have a highvolume of revisable form traffic you will find JNet a very useful tool.andP;  7.andO;The &quot;InternationalandM;Standards&quot; Approach In the area of mail and document integration, I interpretthis to be the use of X.400 compliant mail and documcnt products.andP;  DEC has itin its Mailbus/ Message Router products.andP;  IBM has announced X.400 PROFSConnection, X.400 DISOSS Connection, and X.400/OSI Personal MessagingServices for deliveryin 1990.andP;  So IBM doesn't have it yet.andP;  If you want to doDEC-IBM mail and document interchange with OSI products you'll have to bepatient, or pay SoftSwitch.andP;  It's Your TurnandM;As you're now realizing, each approach mentioned has a series of tradeoffs.andO;Unfortunately, tradeoffs are the nature ofthe DEC-IBM marketplace.andP;  Equallyunfortunate is the tendency of tradeoffs to increase in number as yourimplementation planning progresses.andP;  So now it's your turn to line up thctradeoffs against the requirements of your shop, make your short list, andproceed.andP;  However, it is nice to know that you can take meaningful strideswith real working products that do mail and document exchange between DEC andIBM environments.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
