The decision emerged at the end of a one-day meeting in Paris of transport ministers and chief executives of the industrial partners.    Aviation industry observers said the move demonstrates Europe's eagerness to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market while trying to reduce trade friction over U.S. claims of unfair competition by Airbus.    French Transport Minister Jacques Douffiagues said after the meeting that Airbus Industrie's mandate is &quot;unlimited,&quot; although the negotiations would tend to focus more on planned aircraft than on existing programs.    Officials at McDonnell Douglas remained skeptical about the latest development. A spokesman said years of on-again, off-again talks with Airbus have yet to produce an agreement to collaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
