Nevertheless, nothing short of all-outwar is likely to dislodge Iraq's army from its position inKuwait, according to military analysts in Baghdad.   However, East and West bloc analysts say time is on theside of Iraq's enemies. Baghdad's problems are expected toworsen significantly over the next six to nine months. &quot;Thereis no quick fix that will push Iraq out of Kuwait,&quot; says oneWestern military attache.</LP><TEXT>   On paper, Iraq's military is so formidable as to make anyattack almost unthinkable. Its one million troops, 4,000tanks, 500 combat aircraft and 1,200 missiles make up thethird- or fourth-largest military force in the world,analysts here say. Most equipment is of comparable quality tothat of a European country, such as France.   But Iraq's ability to maintain its forces in the absenceof foreign equipment and expertise is questionable. Iraq canproduce ammunition and some basic components, but it relieson imported spare parts for almost all its sophisticatedweaponry. Many of its combat aircraft still are serviced bySoviets in Iraq, and sometimes are flown back to the U.S.S.R.for major maintenance. The Soviets say they still have 160&quot;specialists&quot; under contract in Iraq to service Sovietequipment and train Iraqis to use it.   Analysts believe that if Iraq continues in its currentdefensive posture, 30% of its materiel could be out ofoperation in nine months. Any fighting or major redeploymentwould cause much more rapid deterioration; at best, Iraqcould sustain a defensive war for no more than two months,and an offensive for one or two weeks, analysts say.   Iraq's other problems are harder to quantify. Gettingwater to troops in Kuwait already is a major problem, andfood supplies are uneven as well. Dysentery is rampant inKuwait and southern Iraq, and there have reportedly beencases of cholera in Kuwait.   Morale and discipline also appear to be poor. As evidence,analysts point to the looting of Kuwait, and two incidentsover the past year when rioting troops -- possibly members ofa Shiite Muslim cell within the Army -- led to shootings anddeaths in Baghdad. Desertion, a serious problem during theIran-Iraq war, also has resumed though there are no reliablefigures on the numbers who have fled into Iran, Saudi Arabiaor the southern marshes of Iraq, where many have becomehighwaymen.   Only the 140,000 &quot;Republican guards&quot; -- half deployed inBaghdad and half in the Kuwaiti theater -- are regarded as acompletely reliable fighting force.   There also are strong signs of dissension within the upperranks of the military. The commander of the air force and thecommander of army aviation have vanished from public view inrecent weeks, presumably because they opposed the invasion ofKuwait. A half-dozen other high-level officers are believedto have been jailed. &quot;Normally,&quot; says one Western analyst,&quot;you don't change horses in the middle of a race.&quot;   Continued resistance in Kuwait may be further erodingIraqi morale. By some estimates, 20 to 25 soldiers a day arebeing treated for wounds caused by sniping and Molotovcocktails -- usually aimed at officers. Analysts say theyhave reliable reports of women driving through the streets ofKuwait and hurling grenades out the windows. Five hundred ormore Iraqis may have been killed or wounded since theinvasion Aug. 2, they say.   As yet, another potential problem for the Iraqi militaryhasn't emerged: the Kurds. Soon after the cease-fire in itswar with Iran, Iraq turned its guns and chemical weapons onthe Kurds, who have been fighting a guerrilla war in thenorth for decades. The Iraqi action decimated the Kurdishresistance. But the north remains tense and heavily armed;with help from foreign-supported Kurds crossing in fromTurkey, Syria or Iran, analysts say, the north could become alow-level second front. Iraqi anxiety in Kurdistan is evidentin the fact that it retains some 200,000 troops in the north.   If fighting does break out, analysts in Baghdad believeheavy ground action is probably unavoidable. While the Westwill eventually have massive air superiority, &quot;you don't winwars by bombing alone,&quot; says one analyst. Also, Iraq'smilitary complex is too dispersed to be destroyed in a firststrike, so there is the risk of retaliatory attacks againstSaudi Arabia and Israel.   But most analysts in Baghdad believe Iraq's much-fearedmissile program is overrated. They say there is no hardevidence that Iraq can equip its missiles with chemicalwarheads. And Iraq's 75 or so missile launchers would quicklybe detected once they started firing, making them vulnerableto attack after only a few rounds.   Iraq may have one other hidden weapon, though. Analystsbelieve more than 2,000 Palestinian commandos have enteredIraq for training since the beginning of the year.Infiltrated into the large Palestinian work force in the Gulfstates, they could become a &quot;fifth column,&quot; analysts say,torching oil fields or sabotaging equipment. A wave of terroragainst Western targets across the Middle East also &quot;is agood probability,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
