Under the agreement with DHL Worldwide Express, based inRedwood City, Calif., and sister company to Brussels-basedDHL International, Emery will share space on DHL's daily jetfreighter service between New York and Brussels. Emery saidDHL would also take over all Emery shipments within Europe,although Emery personnel would still move freight and handleservice on the ground.</LP><TEXT>   Once the agreement takes effect March 1, Emery said itwould close its existing European hub and feeder-aircraftoperation in Maastricht, the Netherlands, canceling allcontract flights both within Europe and a once-daily flightto Europe from New York. Emery said seven of its employeeswill be transferred to Brussels from the closed Netherlandshub while about 20 others will be fired.   Emery officials didn't have an estimate on how much theywould save from the move, the latest in a series of effortsby management to restore solvency to an operation that hasbeen unprofitable since Consolidated acquired it in 1989.Among other things, Consolidated has trimmed the losses byabandoning Emery's high-cost overnight letter business andfocusing on shipments exceeding 50 pounds.   The shift to heavy freight lessened considerably Emery'scompetition with DHL, which focuses on small-packagedelivery, and as a result the two companies said their newarrangement presents no conflict. For Emery, the move cutsthe costs of maintaining expensive aircraft operations whilecontinuing a presence in Europe, and for DHL it meansincreased business.</TEXT></DOC>
