Using blue, pink and yellow chalk, teacher Hiroo Nemoto draws arrows and diagrams on the blackboard as he explains chemical reactions.    Using blue, pink and yellow pens, 48 students copy the arrows and diagrams in their notebooks. No one asks a question, but the intensity is palpable. Most of the students will soon take a national examination that will largely determine their place in society for the rest of their lives.    Five thousand miles away, at Alameda High School near Oakland, Calif., 19 students in Alicia Nourse's French class are reading a Blaise Pascal essay aloud. Half a dozen hands shoot up each time Ms. Nourse asks a question. One boy demonstrates a passage about death by flinging himself onto the floor with his tongue out.    Komaba and Alameda, both staunchly middle-class public schools, are as different as East and West. At a time when education officials in both countries are wringing their hands and debating reform, a comparison of the two schools illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each system.    Komaba's students are engaged in a desperate three-year sprint to accumulate enough knowledge to pass university entrance examinations. By graduation, they will have spent at least one more year in school than Alameda's students, not counting extracurricular cram classes. They will also join the ranks of the most educated high-school students in the world, judging by international test scores.    Nearly one third will fail the university test, becoming &quot;ronin&quot;, which literally means &quot;lordless samurai.&quot; These days, there is little shame in failing once. Many students take the test again. But if they can't pass on subsequent tries, they will be locked out of prestigious jobs.    At Alameda, the drive for academic achievement pales in comparison -- a shortcoming that some observers blame for the decline of America's competitiveness. Alameda students can spend half their time, if they choose, taking nonacademic subjects. Indeed, some Alameda students display a distinctly cavalier attitude, in at least a few cases deliberately flunking a state aptitude test as a protest against school administrators.    But about the same percentage of students at Komaba and Alameda will go on to four-year colleges, which are generally considered better in the U.S. than in Japan. This suggests that Komaba's elite may simply have a head start on Alameda's. And in sharp contrast to students at Komaba, many Alameda students clearly enjoy school and active social lives. They also are encouraged to think for themselves. Schools like Komaba, meanwhile, produce a submissiveness that is almost freakish by American standards.    What follows is a look at the two schools.    Komaba   For Komaba's students, all of whom rank moderately above the national average in academic ability, the pace is punishing. They spend 240 days a year in class, including half days on Saturdays. Many students also go to private cram schools, called &quot;juku&quot;, where they receive extra instruction that lasts two or three hours a day for seniors.    The emphasis is on learning by rote the information that will be on either the national university exam or entrance exams to private colleges. Rika Yamada, a senior girl who hopes to attend a private college, complains that she doesn't enjoy the memorization. &quot;It can't be used in other parts of your life, other than exams,&quot; she says.    But students persevere because they must, in order to pass the big tests. In one recent national exam, students were found in error if they couldn't recall the precise words missing from a geography textbook description of the Bosporus, a 20-mile stretch of water connecting the Black and Marmara seas in Turkey.    The teen-agers who attend Komaba, a three-story school on a tree-dotted campus near Tokyo's busy Shibuya train station, have already survived one national exam. That test, taken in ninth grade, determines which students will attend vocational schools, schools with both vocational and academic programs and three-year fully academic institutions like Komaba, where the curriculum is rigorous and standardized.    After a sophomore year consisting mainly of math, science, social studies and English, Japanese students must choose a major. Slightly more than half of the boys pick science. The majority of girls choose liberal arts, in most cases limiting their chances of attending a prestigious national university.    During &quot;exam hell,&quot; the year leading up to the final test, Komaba's seniors drop out of sports and other extracurricular activities. Their mothers relentlessly pressure them to study harder, often serving them dinner at home at their desks. Fathers, regarded as distractions, are told not to come home until the bars close or the last train runs.    The number of hours a student sleeps is considered a leading indicator of his chances of passing. The old saying, &quot;Four hours pass, five hours fail,&quot; is still repeated, only half facetiously.    Most parents think the effort is worth it. &quot;The examination isn't that much of a hell,&quot; says Yoko Tanaka, who teaches badminton to help defray the $4,500 a year she spends on juku for her two children. &quot;It's only a short period of your life, and your life lies ahead of you much longer after you've graduated from university.&quot;    But many students appear hard-pressed by the demands. In a recent national survey, an overwhelming majority picked this answer to a multiple-choice question about what kind of school they would like to attend: &quot;One with lessons {that} are easier to understand.&quot;    Komaba's students seem to share that view. &quot;Japanese high-school students don't really enjoy their lives,&quot; says Mika Shiraishi, a senior who spent her junior year as an exchange student in San Jose, Calif. &quot;In the U.S., you can say anything to a teacher, just like you're friends. It's not just a blackboard class -- you can learn from a VCR or field trip.&quot;    Yuji Takakuwa, a senior boy, has a bigger complaint. &quot;In Japan,&quot; he says, &quot;everybody has to be the same. Unless Japan becomes a country that respects the individual, it will decline.&quot;    Indeed, at Komaba, conformity is an unwritten rule. About 90% of the students wear the school uniform -- black sailor-style suits for girls and black Nehru jackets and slacks for boys -- though the outfits haven't been compulsory since the student protests of the 1960s. &quot;Many students in this school are conservative and don't like change,&quot; concludes Shinsuke Kaneko, a sophomore boy clad in jeans. &quot;There should be more people who rock the boat.&quot;    In class, though, Komaba students are even more submissive. They stolidly take notes. Very few ask questions. None challenge the ideas of their teachers, who are treated with deep respect and are literally placed on pedestals -- foot-high platforms that symbolize their authority. In fact, one student has nothing at all to say, even when a teacher asks him loudly why he is late to class.    Teaching still attracts some of Japan's most able young people, partly because the pay, ranging from the equivalent of $16,000 to $54,400 annually, puts teachers in the top 10% of wage earners. But some teachers at Komaba are frustrated by how passive their students have become.    In second-period Classical Chinese class, for instance, Hisako Hagiwara tries to use the Socratic method. But she must answer her own questions because her students don't respond. When history teacher Makoto Niimaki tells a bawdy joke about hicks in 19th-century Japan, his students stare blankly. When English teacher Aoi Ogawa tries to spice up a lecture on Ernest Hemingway by discussing the writer's three divorces, her students gaze at their desks. &quot;All of us agree that students' voices {in classroom responses} are getting smaller year by year,&quot; she says.    &quot;We have a problem in that students don't try to improve their own abilities from within,&quot; concludes Chohyoh Hosono, the principal. &quot;They are very tame. If homework is given, they do it very well, but they won't do more than that.&quot;    As might be expected, discipline problems are relatively minor at Komaba. At one point the most serious infraction involved several girls who had been seen eating snacks while walking, a breach of etiquette in Japan.    The students generally lead tame personal lives, too. Unlike their counterparts at Alameda, they aren't distracted by socializing or drugs. One reason is that after a full day of classes, there is little time to spend with friends. Mr. Takakuwa, the senior who worries about Japan declining, has had two dates in three years. Both were visits to a planetarium. When 13 students were asked over lunch whether there is a drug problem at their school, all were puzzled by the concept. &quot;Do you mean medicine?&quot; asked one student.    In a rare display of high spirits, however, two dozen boys and girls recently skipped an all-day assembly by climbing over a seven-foot wall surrounding the school grounds and heading for neighborhood noodle shops and coffee houses.    Nevertheless, instructor Izumi Tamura, who went to school during the militaristic 1930s, concludes that students today are &quot;more suppressed&quot; than in the past. &quot;Their parents push them onto a conveyor belt,&quot; he says.    Like Japanese society, schools are dominated by men. From kindergarten on, boys' names are called first in roll. Four of five high-school teachers are men. Young women account for only 25% of four-year university enrollments. Most girls attend two-year junior colleges so they can spend a few years working before they marry. Only about 10% bother to take entrance exams to Tokyo University, the most prestigious school.    The girls at Komaba don't question this arrangement. &quot;If I liked math or physics, I could go {to a top-rated school},&quot; explains Akiko Shimomura, a senior girl who intends to apply to well-regarded private colleges. &quot;But I don't like them.&quot;    Mariko Mitsui, an English teacher at Komaba who studied in the U.S., is trying to make the Japanese system less sexist. But progress is minimal, she says, because &quot;in Japan, efficiency is more important than equality.&quot;    Alameda   Like many of the high schools run by the 17,000 local boards of education in the U.S., Alameda tries to be all things to all students. It is a college preparatory school, a vocational school and a sort of third parent, offering instruction in matters ranging from sex education to check writing.    Its student body, drawn from the city of Alameda just south of Oakland, is just as diverse. There are disadvantaged minority students, good students, bad students and misfits. With such fragmented purpose and such mixed human material, Alameda can't hope to compete academically with Komaba.    Still, even Alameda's brightest students are required to take only half as many math, science, social-studies and language classes as students at Komaba. The school's curriculum is filled with nonacademic electives such as public speaking, putting out a yearbook and leadership, the latter described in the course catalog as &quot;how to plan and conduct meetings.&quot; Seniors can also get credit for a class called Survival of Singles, featuring instruction in how to &quot;manage time and money while making wise choices in buying, preparing and selecting food, clothing, household furnishings, automobiles and insurance.&quot;    Compared with their counterparts at Komaba, seniors at Alameda are an undisciplined lot. Socializing, dating and, in some cases, sex preoccupy many students' lives. Seniors estimate that 40% to 50% of their peers use drugs or alcohol regularly. Robert Rodd, a 1967 Alameda graduate who has been teaching there for a decade, recalls one boy asking &quot;how long sperm live in a girl. I didn't have the answer,&quot; the teacher says, &quot;but I told him not to fool around with the rhythm method.&quot;    Unlike students at Komaba, many Alameda students hold after-school jobs. Some work because they come from financially strapped, one-parent households. Others use their wages to buy cars and pay for dates.    Alameda students don't do much homework. Officials figure the average is about a half-hour to one hour each night, compared with as much as four hours a night for Komaba students.    At Alameda, some students also seem to resent authority. According to a survey by the student newspaper, 13 of 22 students in a government class last year deliberately flunked a state aptitude test because they resented being pushed around by the principal and test proctors hired from a nearby military base. The newspaper suggested that nearly 10% of all the seniors sabotaged the test, and a larger percentage just didn't try. &quot;I took it casually,&quot; one senior was quoted as saying. Another senior quoted by the newspaper complained that the proctors &quot;were really rude.&quot;    Administrators and teachers don't get much respect from some students either. In the library one afternoon, a vice principal accosts an eleventh-grade boy listening to a tape through headphones, a violation of school regulations. She orders the boy to hand over the headphones. &quot;You'll just have to give me a referral {a punishment} because I'm not giving them to you,&quot; he retorts.    In a remedial English class, meanwhile, Junior Taamu, a lineman on the football team, slouches in his chair and directs a question to his teacher, Carmel Zimmerman. &quot;Hey baby,&quot; he says, &quot;did you miss me? I missed you.&quot; She stares at him, but doesn't reply.    Alameda's teachers must struggle, initially for salaries as low as $23,000, with the learning problems brought on by the school's social diversity. The school is 3% black and 8% Hispanic. In California, these groups on average score at roughly 80% of the level of white students.    About 24% of the student body is Asian-American, a group that generally scores higher than whites in math and slightly lower than whites in reading and spelling. Carol Kyle, who teaches a calculus class made up mostly of Asian-American students, points to a pronounced decline in motivation and persistence among white, middle-class students -- an observation she blames on the deterioration of family life and the work ethic. &quot;Schools only reflect what's going on in society,&quot; she says.    Some of Alameda's students, both white and minority, seem ill-equipped even for remedial education. Mrs. Zimmerman's 27 students struggle to write two-page essays, but the results are riddled with errors. &quot;I've never worked so hard in my life,&quot; the second-year teacher says, blowing a wisp of hair out of her eyes.    But out of Alameda's lack of discipline come some of its strengths. The school's brighter students are constantly asked to think on their feet and challenge each other and their teachers. In Robert Lochner's government class, students are graded on the basis of how well they argue points during spirited discussions of Japanese-American internment during World War II, the right of adult cinemas to operate in town and whether teachers should be allowed to search students' lockers for drugs.    &quot;The teachers get us interested in what's happening, not just in telling us there's a test next week,&quot; says Elizabeth Larriberot, a senior. &quot;It gives a person a chance to show creativity.&quot;    Indeed, many Japanese worry about the U.S.'s perceived edge in creativity. &quot;Japanese kids at 18 know everything,&quot; says Masahiko Fujiwara, a mathematics professor at Tokyo's Ochanomizu University, who has also taught in America. &quot;But in terms of logical thinking, American kids can think better.&quot;    Nevertheless, each system basically gets the results it was designed to produce. High schools such as Komaba produce the world's most educated teen-agers, submissive, disciplined and inured to hard work. Even the majority who don't attend universities are on average as educated as college sophomores in the U.S. and skilled enough to fill Japan's mostly white-collar jobs.    &quot;For economic prosperity, Japanese education is the best and your education is the worst,&quot; concludes Mr. Fujiwara, the Japanese math professor.    But Terrel Bell, a former U.S. secretary of education who visited several Japanese schools in 1985, believes education officials in both countries have something to learn from one another. &quot;I left with the impression that the Japanese have too much pressure and we don't have nearly enough,&quot; Mr. Bell says. &quot;If both nations could come from their extremes to a middle ground, both would benefit.&quot;    ---        Education in the U.S. and Japan: A Comparison                                United States    Japan    Literacy Rate               80%              99%    High school    completion rate             72.7%            90%    Length of school year       180 days         240 days    High school seniors    spending less than    five hours per week    on homework                 76%              35%    Financing of education:      National                   6.2%            47.3%      State                     49.0%            28.1%      Local                     44.8%            24.6%    Teacher salaries            Determined       By national                                locally          law, must                                                 be paid 10%                                                 more than                                                 the top                                                 civil                                                 servant    Salary compared to          Approximately    In the top    other wage earners          average          10% of all                                among all wage   wage                                earners          earners    Sources: U.S. Department of Education; Japanese Ministryof Education</TEXT></DOC>
