It is pointed out as being based on wishful thinking insteadof on reality and is refuted by the example of solar electric power generationfor private households. The paper shows that, neglecting the costs andconcentrating on the energy component, solar energy can contribute toenergy supplies to a certain extent but can never be self-sufficientin our latitudes. Due to the necessity of auxiliary systems integrationsinto existing energy supply structures will be creating problems reflectingthe time- and radiation-dependent availability of solar energy.</TEXT></DOC>
