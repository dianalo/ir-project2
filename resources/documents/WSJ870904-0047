If all goes as now planned, investors in the transaction could earn a staggering pretax profit of $3.8 billion -- more than five times their expected total investment of about $700 million. One big hurdle still remains: persuading a single buyer to purchase what's left of the company at an asking price of at least $3.8 billion, plus the assumption of about $2.2 billion in debt.    Skepticism on Wall Street that Kohlberg Kravis overpaid has faded away as assets of Chicago-based Beatrice, the reputed white elephant of the food industry, have been auctioned off at prices far higher than most expected.    Donald P. Kelly, the deal maker and salesman brought in as Beatrice's chairman by Kohlberg Kravis, has been aided in the process of selling the assets by a combination of lower interest rates, higher stock market multiples and intimate knowledge of Beatrice units.    To date, the original investors in the transaction count themselves roughly even. Mr. Kelly has sold or taken public eight units for a total of about $6.1 billion, plus the assumption of roughly $1 billion in debt. Thus the expected gain of about $3.8 billion from the planned sale of Beatrice's highly profitable domestic food operations would all be on the plus side of the ledger for the investors, who include Kohlberg Kravis management; the pension funds, insurance concerns and other investors that Kohlberg Kravis represents; and the Beatrice management team led by Mr. Kelly.    &quot;It's certainly as successful a transaction in dollar amounts as I've personally ever seen,&quot; says Leonard Green, a partner in Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd., a large New York-based leveraged buy-out concern. &quot;It's a marvelous piece of work.&quot;    Typically, it takes investors about five years to recoup their stake in a leveraged buy-out, in which a group of investors finance an acquisition largely with debt and repay it with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of assets. But Mr. Kelly is on schedule to complete the massive, piecemeal peddling of Beatrice by February, just 22 months after he started.    The key to the transaction's success has been Mr. Kelly's ability to identify value in Beatrice's assets, and to divide and to package them in a way that has made them attractive to potential buyers.    The 65-year-old Mr. Kelly long has been known for his ability to negotiate high prices when he's selling. When he was chairman of Esmark Inc. -- acquired by Beatrice in 1984 -- his name became synomymous on Wall Street with making such moves just before market events occurred that changed the companies' value.    He's apparently &quot;pulling an Esmark&quot; again. Some of Mr. Kelly's doubters, including a few Beatrice executives, worried that he would be forced to part first with the company's crown jewels, its domestic food lines, at fire-sale prices to meet borrowing agreements.    Instead, Mr. Kelly was able to retain those assets while getting top dollar for some businesses that many analysts hardly knew existed. For example, he sold Beatrice's Americold refrigerated-warehouse business for $480 million to management in a leveraged buy-out.    Other top-dollar divestitures benefited from good timing. Coca-Cola Co., showing a new interest in acquiring bottlers, paid $1 billion for Beatrice's Coca-Cola operations. Joel Smilow, a Kelly protege who was running International Playtex Inc., led an investment group in a $1.25 billion buyout of the personal products concern. Mr. Smilow long had wanted to manage independent of the Beatrice umbrella.    &quot;Don knew that company inside out,&quot; says one individual familiar with Beatrice. Kohlberg Kravis &quot;couldn't have done this deal without him.&quot;    Kohlberg Kravis and the other investors also had some good luck. Just after the firm agreed to buy Beatrice, interest rates began to plummet. At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s conference on high-yield &quot;junk bonds&quot; earlier this year, Beatrice executives were said to have stated in their presentation that the drop in interest rates resulted in an $80 million-a-year interest savings for the company between the time that the acquisition was first announced and the time that it was completed.    Moreover, as interest rates were dropping, the market in general -- and food stocks in particular -- began to soar. While Kohlberg Kravis paid a multiple of 8.5 times operating income to buy Beatrice, it has been able to obtain multiples of 10 times to 12 times operating income on divestitures.    There isn't any guarantee that Mr. Kelly can get his asking price of more than $3.8 billion for Beatrice's U.S. food business. He concedes, &quot;There aren't many companies that can actually afford this&quot; price, plus the $2.2 billion debt assumption. If interest rates rise, making financing more expensive, he may find qualified buyers scarce.    But if the market looks soft, Mr. Kelly says, he just won't sell, at least right now. &quot;We'll just keep doing what we're doing,&quot; he says. The food operations had pretax profit last year of $352 million, including a $45 million pretax charge related to costs from the buy-out. Its best-known products include Hunt's tomato products, Wesson cooking oils, Swift meats and Tropicana juices.    At the same time, Kohlberg Kravis doesn't acquire companies for the long term. The firm's strategy usually is to pay down debt quickly and then to try to make a profit by selling or by taking public the acquired concern.    The calculation of the ultimate profit of the Kohlberg Kravis investors doesn't include some benefits they've already reaped. In August, they were paid an $80 million dividend by E-II Holdings Inc., the collection of Beatrice's consumer-products units that Mr. Kelly took public. Moreover, they received about $700 million of E-II stock, which has since dropped slightly in the soft market for new issues. The investors also retain a 20% stake in International Playtex, though its value isn't clear.    ---               Major Beatrice Pieces Sold by KKR DATE         UNIT              SALE PRICE   BUYER                              (In billions) April 1986   Avis car rental       $ .255   Wesray Capital* June 1986    Coca-Cola              1.00    Coca-Cola                bottlers Aug. 1986    International          1.25    Investors led                Playtex                        by management Nov. 1986    Americold               .480   Kelso                warehouse unit Dec. 1986    Webcraft                .225   Private                Technologies                   investors in                                               a leveraged                                               buy-out June 1987    Bottled water           .400   Source Perrier                unit                           S.A.
