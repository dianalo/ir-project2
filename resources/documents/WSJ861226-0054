FialkaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/26/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Pat Robertson, the television preacher, has a standard answer for people who ask about his secular credentials for seeking the presidency in 1988.    He is, as he recently explained to a group of Washington political reporters, a Yale University Law School graduate, the owner of a multimillion-dollar business -- the Christian Broadcasting Network -- and a &quot;passable economist.&quot;    Mr. Robertson's status as an economist has been enhanced by a series of news clippings from Business Week, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine and the Associated Press, all of which have stated that Mr. Robertson either attended or graduated from the prestigious London School of Economics.    In fact, Mr. Robertson comes from the homemade school of economists. A spokesman for the London School of Economics says it never heard of him. Mr. Robertson hasn't any undergraduate degree in economics either.    &quot;In part, reporters have jumped to conclusions,&quot; explains David West of Americans for Robertson, his campaign organization. Mr. West suggested that the errors about Mr. Robertson's supposed economics education, which have been appearing since 1981, come from reporters repeatedly copying an erroneous story.    Others, he added, may have jumped to the wrong conclusion from Mr. Robertson's campaign biography, which lists &quot;Graduate study, University of London,&quot; near the top of Mr. Robertson's academic achievements. (That appears to be the way The Wall Street Journal fell into error in a story about Mr. Robertson on Oct. 17, 1985.)    Mr. Robertson has also showcased his graduate-school experience on television. &quot;I have 10 years of higher education. . . . I've been to school, in graduate school at the University of London,&quot; he explained on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;    Spokesmen for the University of London and for Mr. Robertson confirm that his graduate studies there were limited to a three-month summer course in 1950 on British arts and architecture, aimed primarily at visiting American students.    As Mr. Robertson mulls his probable presidential bid, most attention has so far focused on his religious leanings. Increasingly, however, his views on other issues and his qualifications for office will attract public scrutiny. How well he holds up under such scrutiny is critical to his hopes of being taken seriously in 1988.    Mr. Robertson's economic expertise wins praise in some corners. A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic consultant and an expert cited by the Robertson camp as vouching for his knowledge of economics, says Mr. Robertson shows an impressive grasp of economics for an amateur. &quot;He knows more about economics than most corporate CEOs that we deal with as clients,&quot; says Mr. Shilling, who has made several guest appearances on Mr. Robertson's television show, &quot;The 700 Club.&quot; Still, many of Mr. Robertson's Bible-based economic prognostications and proposals -- such as a call for a universal cancellation of debts every 50 years -- find little favor among mainstream economists.    G. Benton Miller Jr., a spokesman for the Christian Broadcasting Network, says Mr. Robertson's main experience as an &quot;economist&quot; came between 1977 and 1982, when he wrote a monthly economic newsletter called Pat Robertson's Perspective for donors to his 700 Club. In answer to a reporter's query, Mr. Robertson's campaign organization said that copies of the newsletter -- which was discontinued in the fall of 1982 -- were &quot;unavailable.&quot; A collection of issues was found, however, in the rare-book room of the library of CBN University, Mr. Robertson's college. These issues show that some of his earlier economic views were both highly unorthodox and deeply pessimistic about the future of the U.S. economy.    In January 1981, for example, he proposed that the U.S. adopt a constitutional amendment: &quot;At the end of every 49 years would be a 50th year of Jubilee. In the year of Jubilee, all debts would be canceled.&quot; The idea, Mr. Robertson explained, was borrowed from a practice followed by the Jews in the Old Testament.    In the same issue, Mr. Robertson advocated abolishing the Federal Reserve and the Social Security systems, replacing the latter with a program allowing workers to &quot;save through regulated institutions acting as mutual funds.&quot;    &quot;At present,&quot; Mr. Robertson wrote in November 1979, &quot;the odds are about 85-15 that we will experience a major world-wide depression in the early 1980s.&quot; That depression, a major theme in the newsletters, would be followed by a Soviet attack on the Middle East and a nuclear war &quot;on an awesome scale.&quot; Mr. Robertson predicted the events would occur &quot;probably by 1982.&quot;    The often-dour economic views expressed in his newsletter stand out in stark contrast to a theme of his current exploratory campaign for the presidency. In a speech before an economic group last September, Mr. Robertson predicted &quot;incredible prosperity&quot; in 1986. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, he predicted, might reach 3500 &quot;in a couple of years, or maybe sooner.&quot;    Just four years earlier, in February 1982, Mr. Robertson advised his followers: &quot;It would be most prudent to move funds out of stocks, bonds, savings and loans, and uninsured money-market funds and either directly into short-term government securities or into one of the several money-market funds that invest exclusively in government-backed securities.&quot;    There was, however, one common theme in Mr. Robertson's economic advice. &quot;Funds placed in God's kingdom will prosper regardless of the business cycle,&quot; he said.    Mr. Miller says Mr. Robertson doesn't want to comment on his economic newsletters, which were intended to present a &quot;biblical perspective&quot; on economic events. Asked why the newsletters ended in 1982, at about the same time Mr. Robertson had earlier predicted a nuclear war would occur, Mr. Miller says Mr. Robertson &quot;felt as though the time he was supposed to devote to writing that was at an end and he needed to get on to other things.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
