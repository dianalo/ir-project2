Observers also said players liquidated long positions ahead of today's release of U.S. employment figures for January.    &quot;Too many people found themselves stuck with long dollar positions,&quot; said a trader in New York.    Late in the New York business day, the dollar was trading at intraday lows against both the mark and yen. It was quoted around 1.6832 marks, down from 1.6928 marks late Wednesday in New York. It was quoted at 127.95 yen, below 128.25 yen late Wednesday in New York.    The U.S. currency also eased against the British pound, the Swiss and French francs, and its Canadian counterpart.    The dollar hit intraday peaks of 1.6990 marks and 128.95 yen around midday in New York, but drifted lower after failing to breach 1.7 marks.    &quot;The dollar fell back due to sheer frustration because we saw we weren't going to break through 1.70, so players liquidated long positions,&quot; said Mark Johnson, a trader at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia.    Jerry Egan, a trader at First National Bank of Boston, said that when the dollar was unable to make a breakthrough, &quot;players holding long positions were forced to bail out.&quot; As the U.S. unit fell, &quot;stop-loss orders around 1.6900 marks added more downward pressure on the dollar,&quot; he said.    &quot;Once the market got the ball rolling, the dollar began to fall apart,&quot; said Mr. Egan. He added that &quot;the only factor that could support the dollar (would have been) incredible and unparalleled Japanese participation&quot; in Thursday's third leg of the U.S. Treasury's refunding operation. Most analysts described the Japanese purchases as ordinary.    &quot;The only reason I can see for the dollar's weakness is . . . technical,&quot; said Chris Hogan, a trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York, adding that &quot;the recent mileage the dollar has gotten on events like the refunding seems to have worn out.&quot;    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate, to be released today, is estimated to have risen to 5.9% in January, slightly above December's 5.8% rate, according to a survey of economists.    The December rate was the lowest level in more than eight years. Nonfarm payrolls are estimated to have climbed 228,000 in January, compared with a strong increase of 326,000 in December.    Some traders said the market was anxiously awaiting indications of foreign participation in the Treasury's sale of $8.76 billion of 29 1/4-year bonds yesterday. Favorable reception of the securities by foreigners could boost the dollar for the near term, analysts said.    Meanwhile, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $5.70 an ounce to $444.40 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 4.4 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $444.45 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                 LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, Feb. 4, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
