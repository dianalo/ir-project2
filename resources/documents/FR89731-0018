Communications should identify theregulatory docket number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specifiedabove. All communications received on or before the closing date for commentswill be considered by the FAA before taking action on the proposed rule.The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments.Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Regional Rules Docket, Federal Aviation Administration, Office ofthe Assistant Chief Counsel, 4400 Blue Mound Road, Room 158, Building 3B,Fort Worth, Texas 76193-0007, for examination by interested persons. Areport summarizing each FAA-public contact, concerned with the substanceof the proposed AD, will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcardon which the following statement is made: Comments to Docket Number 88-ASW-24.The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.This notice proposes to amend Amendment 39-5964 (53 FR 30023; August 10,1988), AD 88-17-09, which currently requires a preflight check of the tailrotor transmission installation for security in accordance with MDHC ServiceInformation Notices on MDHC Model 369D, E, F, FF helicopters. After issuingAmendment 39-5964, the FAA has determined that (1) performing the preflightcheck of the tail rotor transmission installation and recording the entryas required by andSection; 43.9 prior to each flight, has placed an unnecessaryburden on the pilot; (2) that properly torqued studs are highly unlikelyto loosen significantly in such short periods of time; and (3) less frequentchecks are warranted without affecting the level of safety. Therefore,the FAA is proposing to amend Amendment 39-5964 by reducing the frequencyof the checks to intervals of 25 hours' time in service on MDHC Model 369D,E, F, FF helicopters.This notice also proposes to update the address in the incorporation byreference paragraph. The incorporation by reference of MDHC Service InformatinNotice (SIN) DN-151/EN-39/FN-2, dated October 10, 1987, was previouslyapproved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1988.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposed rule will not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is relieving in natureand imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, I certify thatthis action (1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2)is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) does not warrant preparation of aregulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal; and (4)if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive ornegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofPart 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES </ITAG>1.
