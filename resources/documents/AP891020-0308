For $476.5 Million</HEAD><BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco Inc. said Friday it has agreed to acquireTana Production Corp. in a deal valued at $476.5 million _ part ofa continuing effort to expand oil and gas reserves and Texaco'sfirst major purchase since completing a massive restructuringearlier this year.   The merger with Corpus Christi, Texas-based Tana Production, asubsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc., includes the purchase of435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and about 4 million barrelsof oil located in 17 South Texas fields, Texaco said.   Texaco will pay $95.1 million in cash and the remaining $381.4million in shares of a new, non-voting issue of Texaco Series Evariable-rate preferred stock.   The acquisition, subject to the approval of governmentregulators, is expected to be completed by the end of the year,said Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y.   ``We have long said that our selected focus is to maintain astrong reserve base in the United States,'' said Texaco PresidentJames W. Kinnear. ``This agreement ... will increase Texaco'sdomestic reserves at a very attractive price.''   Industry analysts said the merger was not a surprise.   ``Now that they have reduced debt significantly, they can dothis,'' said Frank P. Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. ``Texaco has made a number of sales; this is theirfirst big buy.''   Some analysts said the purchase was significant in that itshowed a reversal from recent years when Texaco entered BankruptcyCourt and underwent a major restructuring.   ``This sets a new course in terms of reversing the direction ofthe last couple of years when they were divesting assets,'' saidMichael Young, analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Texaco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having topost a multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight with PennzoilCo.   Pennzoil had sued claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of GettyOil Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part ofreserve-rich Getty. A Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3 billionjudgment. Texaco appealed but eventually settled with Pennzoil for$3 billion.   Earlier this year, Texaco completed a major restructuring thatinvolved the sale of some $7 billion in assets. Last year, Texacoturned a profit of $1.3 billion, compared with a 1987 loss of $4.14billion. Texaco has said the company expects a further improvementin 1989.   The Tana purchase strengthens Texaco's position as a seller andproducer of natural gas in the United States, Kinnear said. Texacoalready is one of the largest producers of natural gas in thiscountry.   ``We feel that natural gas is a fine fuel for the future for thehighest and best use _ for home heating, for power generation, forcogeneration and for environmental concerns.''   Kinnear said, however, he does not expect natural gas tochallenge gasoline as a motor fuel.   Texaco, starting with the 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil, hasattempted to improve its eroding domestic reserve base.</TEXT></DOC>
