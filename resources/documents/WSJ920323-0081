Ever since the big paper and fiberglass company turnedover 80% of its stock to a trust as part of its bankruptcyreorganization, a sale or breakup has been a probability. Butthat now seems imminent. Mr. Stephens has restructuredManville into a holding company with two autonomous -- andhighly marketable -- operating units. The units even got newnames -- Schuller International Inc. and RiverwoodInternational Corp. -- to distance them from Manville and itsasbestos-tainted past.</LP><TEXT>   The restructuring has created several options, includingspinoffs, sales of units or a sale of the entire company. &quot;Weknow the change in ownership is going to happen,&quot; says Mr.Stephens. &quot;What we've tried to do is have the maximumflexibility, in case the market puts more value on the piecesthan the whole.&quot;   Indeed, analysts say that's probably what the market willdo, partly because the two units, which are major players inthe fiberglass and paperboard businesses, have promisingprospects. But there is also a sense that their full valuewon't be recognized as long as they are part of Manville, apariah to investors since it emerged from bankruptcy-courtprotection in 1988. &quot;Some people have realized that Manvilleis undervalued, but getting the stock {price} up is hard,&quot;says Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Donald Zwyer.   A breakup of some sort also seems inevitable because theManville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, whose principalasset is its Manville stock, needs to liquidate that holdingin order to pay an estimated $2 billion in claims fromasbestos victims. Under Manville's reorganization plan, thetrust can sell shares in the company at any time, but can'tsolicit offers for its entire block until next year. Becauseit controls the company's stock, says Michael Lowenstein,general partner of Tyndall Partners, a minority shareholder,the trust can dictate the company's future. &quot;They're the800-pound gorilla and their interests are paramount,&quot; hesays.   Robert Falise, the trust's new managing trustee, says he'spleased with Mr. Stephens's recent actions because they'veincreased the trust's options and made the company'soperations more efficient. But he isn't ready to reveal hisplans for the trust's holdings. Last Monday, the trust namedGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. as its investment adviser.   The trust's interests are simple: getting the highestpossible value for its Manville holdings. As a prudentinvestor, Mr. Lowenstein says, &quot;the trust should diversifyout of Manville,&quot; where it now has all its assets.   But the trust wouldn't get the best price for its Manvillestock by selling it on the open market, analysts say. Morelikely, Mr. Lowenstein and others predict, one or both ofManville's units will be sold or spun off in a publicoffering. The trust could get cash either from a dividendfunded by the sale of a unit or from the sale of shares in aspinoff.   Such a dismantling would mark the end of one of the mostinteresting chapters in American corporate history. Manvillewas the world's largest producer of asbestos, a widely usedinsulating fiber. But when the product was linked to a numberof serious illnesses, a raft of lawsuits from workers andcustomers threatened to strangle the company. Manville filedfor Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code protection in 1982. By 1985,the company had quit the asbestos business entirely. &quot;It'slike GM getting out of cars,&quot; says Dick Von Wald, Manvillegeneral counsel.   When it emerged from bankruptcycourt protection after sixyears, Manville's victims had become its owners. Through thetrust, current and future asbestos victims were given $2.5billion in assets, including the common stock, bondsrepresenting $75 million in annual payments and 20% of thecompany's profits.   The new Manville invested in wood products, fiberglass andpapermaking and sold off &quot;a lot of dogs and cats,&quot; says Mr.Stephens, including its Celite division and a maker ofHolophane lamps. It also decentralized to increaseefficiency, trimming its corporate headquarters staff to 306from 487. &quot;It was hard to know what we did and how much moneywe made,&quot; explains Mr. Stephens, who came to the company withthe 1979 purchase of Olinkraft Corp.   The current businesses are good ones, says Stephen Dobi,analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Riverwood has alarge share of the U.S. market for high-quality coatedpaperboard for beverage carriers, an enviable position, hesays. Beverage-can use is exploding worldwide, boostingdemand for Manville's paperboard.   Schuller International's strength isn't as obvious atfirst glance. Operating in the more cyclical construction andauto business, Schuller posted a $5 million operating loss inrecession-ridden 1991. But over the past 18 months, thecompany has pared down its annual fiberglass production costsby $75 million and could produce $100 million in operatingearnings on about $1 billion in sales when the economy picksup, says Mr. Zwyer of Salomon Brothers.   But in spite of Manville's metamorphosis, most investorsstill can't see anything but asbestos -- or asbestosliability -- when they look at the company's stock. Questionsresurfaced about Manville's liability to asbestos victims in1990, when the trust ran out of liquid assets to pay claims.With the possibility that claimants might go to Manville formore money, the stock dipped to a low of $4 early in 1991,after trading as high as $10.50 in 1989.   To eliminate that risk, the trust and the company haverestructured their agreement. Manville will boost the trust'scurrent income by paying $650 million in dividends toshareholders (including the trust) over the next seven years.U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in New York alsoaffirmed an injunction, which shields the company fromadditional asbestos claims, and ruled that his affirmationcan't be appealed. &quot;That's the kind of certainty we wereafter,&quot; says Mr. Von Wald. &quot;Manville is a company that hasput asbestos risk questions behind us.&quot;   Apparently, the market isn't buying that yet. WhileMessrs. Zwyer and Dobi value Manville at $14 to $15 a share,the stock closed Friday at $8.875, unchanged, in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange.   &quot;People feel it's almost not worth the effort to lookthrough the fog and see what's going on down there,&quot; Mr. Dobisays.   While it hasn't boosted the stock back to its 1989 highsyet, brokerage house interest has begun to pick up recently,as evidenced by rising attendance at the company'spresentations in New York. At the most recent meeting inFebruary, a watershed event of sorts occurred: For the firsttime in years, company officials were asked more questionsabout operations than about the asbestos trust.   ---               Manville Corp. by the Numbers                                                                                                                          The Fundamentals                                                                                                                                   1991         1990                                                                                                            Sales (billions)       $2.00        $2.10                                                                                                          MAJOR PRODUCT LINES:   Fiberglass insulation for automotive, aerospace andconstruction; fiberglass reinforcements; wood products;linerboard and coated paperboard; paperboard containermachines.
