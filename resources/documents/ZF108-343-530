(communication systems)Laser Communications Inc.

(LCI).andM;&quot;Laser transmission technology has emerged as an ideal alternative solutionfor short-haul connections where other links, such as cabling or microwave,are cost prohibitive, impractical, or simply impossible by any other means.&quot;andM;LCI has developed a line of products which use infrared laser technology toprovide alternatives for transmitting data, audio or video in line-of-sightapplications up to one kilometre apart.andM;No right of way licenses, permits, site surveys or FCC approvals arerequired.andM;&quot;With LACE we've taken the laser beam out of the futuristic Star Wars/BuckRodgers scenario and brought it into the present day, signaling a new era infunctional laser technology,&quot; Berman says.andM;Fully functional as both a primary and back-up link, LACE is comprised ofboth a 10 lb.andP;  transceiver unit and 10 lb.andP;  receiver unit.andM;For example, Rockwell International, a supplier of products to the aerospace,electronics, automotive and graphics businesses, operates an Ethernet networkat its Richardson, Tex.andP;  location.andM;Its primary use is for CAD/CAM data transmission for Department of Defensecontract work.andP;  PCs connected to DEC Vaxes are used.andP;  The network is alsoused for general communications at this location, which is consists of a maincampus (four buildings) and two leased buildings located approximately fourmiles away.andM;Although there was a microwave link from the main campus to one of the leasedbuildings, the second leased building was not connected.andP;  Rockwell needed alink to the second building, which is 100 yards from the first, so that thosein the second building could exchange data with other sites.andM;Rockwell explored the use of fiber optics and microwave technologies to solvetheir problem.andP;  These media, however, proved to be costly in terms of moneyand time because of site surveys and right-of-way approval requirements.andM;As data is on a main server, Rockwell required full bandwidth and therefore,required a solution that could provide high transmission speeds.andM;Dale Ensminger, manager of computing resources at Rockwell, learned of lasertransmission by word-of-mouth and felt that it would be an ideal alternativefor transmitting data, voice or video where other links, such as cabling ormicrowave, are cost prohibitive, impractical, or simply impossible.andM;Although Rockwell installed an additional LACE unit as a back-up, they havenot needed it thus far.andM;Recently there was a tornado watch in the area.andP;  Ensminger and others wereapprehensive about LACE holding up in what turned out to be very stong winds.andM;Although not a tornado, the strong winds ripped the roof apart.andP;  The LACEsystem was still working, and it didn't even require re-adjustment.andM;They have also been concerned about fog and heat, but neither has produced aproblem as yet.andM;Ensminger and colleagues are happy with this wireless set-up .andP;  He says alsothat the system's transparency to the user was also a key benefit as theywere able to use the equipment immediately without further training.andM;Additionally, Ensminger said the company is considering moving out of theleased location and would be happy to take the compact LACE system with them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
