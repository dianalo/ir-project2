It remains to be seen whether he can survive atwo-week visit with the American media. Mr. Mandela's visitto the United States is scheduled to receive saturation TVcoverage, and by its end, there's little doubt that Mr.Mandela will sit in the eyes of many millions of Americans asa man of courage and moral stature. We're more than a littleworried, however, that the bright lights are going to washout most of the complex political issues that swirl aroundthis man and his country.   Mr. Mandela arrives in the U.S. tomorrow and will addressa joint session of Congress next week. While most such eventswill focus on Mr. Mandela as a symbol of determinedresistance to apartheid, he is in fact the leader of anorganization, the African National Congress, that is itselfdivided over the means appropriate to dismantle apartheid.</LP><TEXT>   Back in South Africa, militant blacks accuse the ANC'sleaders of &quot;selling out&quot; by pursuing negotiations with the deKlerk government. Mr. Mandela can speak for himself, butoften his statements and actions suggest a man eitherunwilling to disown the violent terrorist tactics of many inhis party or unable to disengage from their authority.   For instance, he will visit the U.S. fresh from trips onwhich he repeatedly praised Moammar Gadhafi, Fidel Castro andYasser Arafat. This Thursday, Mr. Mandela is scheduled toshare a platform in New York with the three Puerto Ricannationalists who spent 25 years in prison for the 1954shooting of five Members of Congress inside the Housechamber. Organizer Jaime Estades says this &quot;shouldn't alarmanybody. Mandela is an ex-political prisoner who is meetingwith other political prisoners.&quot; Having been invited toaddress a joint session of Congress, why does Mr. Mandelafeel obliged to show solidarity with people who shot upCongress more than 30 years ago?   When Mr. Mandela was released in February, we expressedthe hope that he would realize that a free South Africa canbe won without continuing the &quot;armed struggle&quot; that haskilled many innocent civilians. Zambia's President KennethKaunda, host for the ANC's main bases, and Archbishop DesmondTutu have called on the ANC to suspend its guerrilla actions.But Mr. Mandela insists that the ANC won't renounce violenceas part of power-sharing talks.   Mr. Mandela has met the PLO's Yasser Arafat three times,more than with any other foreign leader. Mr. Mandela says,&quot;We are in the same trench struggling against the same enemy:the twin Tel Aviv and Pretoria regimes, apartheid, racism,colonialism and neocolonialism.&quot;   Visiting Angola in April, Mr. Mandela singled out FidelCastro's Cuba as an &quot;inspiration&quot; and praised &quot;its love forhuman rights and liberty.&quot;   Last month, Mr. Mandela went to Libya, where he saiddictator Moammar Gadhafi and he were &quot;comrades in arms.&quot; Mr.Mandela condemned the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya.   While Mr. Mandela is able to spend time and praise onMessrs. Castro, Arafat and Gadhafi, he canceled a scheduledmeeting in his own country with Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, atwhich the two men were to discuss the bloody warfare betweentheir followers. Three days before the meeting, the ANCleadership reportedly persuaded him not to meet with thepro-Western head of seven million Zulus.   Mr. Buthelezi is a nephew of the ANC's founder, and was aloyal ANC member until the mid-1970s when he broke with thegroup over its bombing of civilian targets. When asked aboutMr. Buthelezi in Rome last week, Mr. Mandela said the meremention of his name was &quot;unfortunate.&quot; Mr. Buthelezi is&quot;totally isolated.&quot;   On the ground in South Africa, the ANC is a differententity than the one often praised in the West. The ANC isparticularly hostile to objective coverage in the black mediaof its actions. Thami Mazwai, an editor of the country'slargest black newspaper, the Sowetan, recently told of howblack newspapers had been threatened by the ANC and othergroups unhappy with coverage of &quot;necklace&quot; murders andclassroom boycotts. He and a Sowetan photographer wererecently cornered by activists intent, he said, on murderingthe two. Bystanders intervened. A regional president of theANC recently told reporters that the group &quot;expects most, ifnot all, members of the media to become card-carrying membersof the ANC.&quot;   Mr. Mandela leads a group that may soon holdresponsibility for the fate of millions of South Africans. Ifhe is serious about bringing peace to the country, someoneshould ask him how it is in the best interests of his fellowSouth Africans for him to visit Colonel Gadhafi as a comradewhile refusing even to talk to Mr. Buthelezi, the leader ofhis country's largest tribe.</TEXT></DOC>
