Economists generally expect the Commerce Department to report a narrowing of the merchandise trade gap to $13 billion in February from $14.8 billion in January.    Such a narrowing might warm market sentiment toward the dollar in the short run, traders said, but they doubt it would affect what they call the long-term negative outlook for the U.S. currency.    &quot;Momentarily, it could help, but the (trade) number can't change the trend over the long term,&quot; Christiane Mandell, an economist at Barclays Bank International Ltd. in New York, said.    The Bank of Japan was the only central bank active in the currency market yesterday, in contrast to Friday's concerted intervention by five central banks in support of the dollar. The Bank of Japan sold yen to buy an estimated $700 million in Tokyo trading. Its intervention has become almost a daily routine since the dollar fell below the 150-yen level March 24.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 142.33 yen, down 0.4% from 142.85 Friday. Its decline had been 0.9% in the previous day's trading. The dollar eased 0.2% to 1.8071 West German marks from 1.8113, compared with a 0.5% fall in the previous session. The British pound climbed to $1.6254 from $1.6220.    In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 142.05 yen.    The dollar was little changed in trading around the world yesterday as anticipation of the trade report, to be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, muted activity.    &quot;Everyone is battening down the hatches waiting,&quot; Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. Despite the dollar's stability yesterday, compared with last week's steep decline, &quot;there isn't any change in fundamental market psychology,&quot; he said. &quot;People don't like the dollar.&quot;    The February trade statistics may be important only for short-term dealings in the currency market. Investors and traders say that in the absence of any clear trend toward improvement in the U.S. trade balance, today's data won't have any extended impact. Mr. Kreicher said that even if the February deficit shrinks to $12.5 billion, &quot;that's still $150 billion annualized and isn't the sort of thing that you go out and celebrate.&quot;    Ms. Mandell of Barclays Bank said &quot;several months of improving (trade) numbers&quot; would be needed to turn sentiment around.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.10 an ounce to $437.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $437.55 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Monday, April 13, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
