Chun Kyung Hwan was convicted and sentenced along with 13 of his associates in the government-supported rural development agency known as the Saemaul Undong, or New Community Movement. Chun Kyung Hwan was found guilty of bribery, embezzlement, influence-peddling and tax evasion. Besides his fine and prison term, he was ordered to return about $1.4 million in embezzled funds to the Saemaul headquarters that he was in charge of during his brother's administration.    The trial was closely watched as a test of President Roh Tae-Woo's determination to investigate fully a long list of wrongdoings ascribed to his predecessor and close friend, Chun Doo Hwan, and his family.    Ruling-party sources and political analysts said they expected the verdict to dispel much of the public venom against the former president and his family and allow Korea to devote itself totally to hosting the Olympic Games in Seoul this month.    But opposition leaders said the prison sentence for Chun Kyung Hwan, less than half the 15 years demanded by prosecutors, will provide momentum for a new push on the National Assembly's continuing investigations. The inquiries, which will resume after the Olympics, have been slowed by fighting between opposing political groups over how deeply Korea wants to dig into the past and whether to bring the former president himself into court. </TEXT></DOC>
