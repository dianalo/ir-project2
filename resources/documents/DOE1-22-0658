The hadronicjet signal competes with the QCD production of jets, a subject of interestin its own right. Tests of perturbative QCD at the SSC will be of specialinterest because the calculations are expected to be quite reliable.Studies show that compositeness up to a scale of 20 to 35 TeV would bedetected in hadronic jets at the SSC. Leptonic evidence would be discoveredfor scales up to 10 to 20 TeV. The charge asymmetry for leptons wouldprovide information on the nature of the compositeness interaction. Calorimetrywill play a crucial role in the detection of compositeness in the hadronicjet signal. Deviations from an e/h response of 1 could mask the effect.The backgrounds for lepton pair production seem manageable. 30 refs.,19 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
