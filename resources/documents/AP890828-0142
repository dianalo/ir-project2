(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A decision by local authorities toprosecute mothers whose babies test positive for drugs has civillibertarians afraid the threat of criminal charges will deteraddicts from seeking prenatal care.   Four infants born with cocaine or heroin in their systems havebeen taken from their mothers in the last month and placed in fosterhomes or protective custody.   The solicitor's office responsible for Greenville and Pickenscounties has charged three of the mothers and the parents of thefourth mother, a 15-year-old girl, with child neglect. No trialdates have been set.   Authorities said it is necessary to prosecute these women toforce them to get treatment for their addictions.   The policy drew criticism from the American Civil LibertiesUnion, which fears women will shy away from seeking prenatal care ortreatment for addiction for fear their newborns will be taken awayand they will be prosecuted.   The Greenville-Pickens policy makes it ``a crime to bepregnant,'' said Lynn Paltrow, staff attorney for the ACLU in NewYork.   ``Assuming these women really took drugs, addiction is aphysiological health problem,'' Ms. Paltrow said. ``It's an illnessthat needs treatment.''   Solicitor Joseph J. Watson's district in Greenville and Pickenscounties has a population of 367,000. The district in northwesternSouth Carolina is a mix of rural and industrial areas, with industryconcentrated near Greenville.   The South Carolina county is one of the first in the nation toexpand a criminal child neglect charge to cover drug-abusing mothers.   Conviction carries up to 10 years in prison, but only probationand treatment will be recommended, Assistant Solicitor CatherineChrisotophillis said.   Elsewhere, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson signed a law Thursdayexpanding child-neglect law to protect newborns who test positivefor illegal drugs.   In Florida, a woman whose two children tested positive forcocaine was placed on 15 years' probation Friday for drug delivery,a charge routinely used against drug dealers. A judge ruled shedelivered drugs via the umbilical cord.   Similar cases in at least three other states _ California, Texasand Ohio _ have been dismissed.   Prosecuting women for using drugs while pregnant is necessary toidentify such women who might not otherwise come forward fortreatment, Watson and Ms. Christophillis said. They said it shouldnot deter women from seeking prenatal care.   ``I feel if we can rehabilitate (the mothers) now, we can saveanother baby being born,'' Ms. Christophillis said.   Watson acknowledged, however, that ``to emphasize the punishmentside of things could potentially drive mothers away from thehospital.''   Watson said women whose infants showed signs of fetal alcoholsyndrome would also be prosecuted.</TEXT></DOC>
