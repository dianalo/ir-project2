As a result of these studies, the first5 exploratory wells were drilled which were the model for the constructionof the following ones. At present more than 74,000 m have been drilledamong 47 wells. With the double objective of observing the performanceof the field under continuous working and of starting amortization ofthe investments for the studies, 5 turbogenerators were installed atwellheads, generating 25 MW/h with atmospheric discharge. These wentinto operation in September 1982, and as of March 1985 they showed anaccumulated generation of 363,553 MW/h. It was decided to begin constructionthis year of a 50 MW geothermoelectric power plant, and for the mediumand long term others of 271 MW/h are being considered. This paper describesthe surface and structural geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and geologyof the subsoil of this field, well drilling, injection, and production.9 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
