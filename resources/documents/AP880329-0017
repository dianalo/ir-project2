(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Elders of the Assemblies of God onMonday began debating how long TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart shouldbe barred from preaching.   The 232-member General Presbytery, meeting in a two-day,closed-door session, will have the final say on punishment againstthe fire-and-brimstone preacher accused of hiring a prostitute topose naked for him.   ``This is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence ofJimmy Swaggart; he has already confessed,'' said church spokeswomanJuleen Turnage. ``They are here to make a decision on what will bedone with his credentials.''   The presbyters met for about six hours Monday. The was noimmediate word on the progress of the deliberations.   Swaggart, who did not attend Monday's meeting, tearfully steppeddown from his pulpit Feb. 21, admitting to unspecified sin.Published reports have said he paid a prostitute to pose naked.   The church's Louisiana District has proposed a three-monthsuspension from the pulpit, despite a request by the church'snational leaders to reconsider.   Church leaders noted that every other Assemblies minister whohas confessed to moral failure has been barred from the pulpit forat least a year.   The church's board of directors kept off Monday's agenda acompromise proposal put forward by an Arkansas church member, saidMrs. Turnage.   The compromise reportedly would bar Swaggart from the pulpit fora year but allow him to give personal testimony about what he haslearned from his sin. It would also cut the Assemblies of God outof an estimated $12 million a year in Swaggart-raised funds.   Mrs. Turnage said the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, generalsuperintendent of the Assemblies and chairman of the meeting, wouldbrief members on Swaggart's transgression and members would also begiven documentation.   No witnesses will be called, and the case will be decided bymajority vote, she said.   A New Orleans TV station reportedly had been asked to showAssemblies officials a videotape of an interview with a prostitutewho claims to have posed naked for Swaggart.   Mrs. Turnage said Carlson and others had seen a videotapeMonday. She would not comment on the nature of the tape and said itwould not be shown to the board.   The Springfield News-Leader reported Monday that a Little Rock,Ark., lawyer and Assemblies member had helped work out a plan thatwould bar Swaggart from preaching for a year. Attorney CliffJackson told the newspaper that the plan would allow Swaggart,during that yearlong period, to give personal testimony.   Under the plan, the Assemblies of God would no longer acceptfunds from Swaggart's multimillion-dollar ministry to avoid theappearance of conflict of interest.   Swaggart contributes an estimated $12 million a year to theAssemblies' foreign missions programs, which had a total budget ofabout $142 million last year.   Jackson, who met with Assemblies officials Sunday, said theproposal had been endorsed by both Swaggart and Louisiana churchofficials.   Mrs. Turnage said the Executive Presbytery, the church's boardof directors, decided not to put Jackson's proposal on the GeneralPresbytery's agenda.   She would not comment on what the board thought of the proposal,saying only that procedures do not allow for outsiders to get itemsput on the agenda for such meetings.   However, she said, Jackson sent copies of the 10-page proposalto every member of the General Presbytery, and any one of themcould bring the proposal up for a vote.</TEXT></DOC>
