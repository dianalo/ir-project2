Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Beyond the flap over Sen. Dan Quayle's military-service record, there is a substantive slice of the vice presidential nominee's background that is worth pondering: his views on arms control and nuclear strategy.    As national security analysts study his hard-line record, they will consider one question in particular: Does the selection of Mr. Quayle tell the world something about how George Bush will approach national security issues?    The early guessing is that while the young and largely unheralded Indiana Republican wouldn't be a powerful voice, he might have at least some influence on the Bush approach to national security issues. Though very few of his colleagues regard Sen. Quayle as a deep strategic thinker, he has become heavily involved in complex arms issues in the past few years.    So his nomination means that a spokesman for a hard-nosed, skeptical but sophisticated school of thought on arms control will at least have a place at the White House decision-making table if Mr. Bush is elected.    Mr. Quayle's conservative credentials on national security issues are impeccable. The hard-line American Security Council gives him a 100% approval rating for votes he has cast in almost 12 years in Congress, a rating that covers votes on issues ranging from aid for Nicaragua's Contra rebels to the MX missile and the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI, the so-called Star Wars missile-defense system. &quot;There isn't a vote he's ever cast that we disagree with,&quot; says Gregg Hilton, director of the council's Washington office.    On strategic and arms-control issues, Mr. Quayle leans for advice on Henry Sokolski, his bright young aide on national security issues. Both Mr. Sokolski and Sen. Quayle, in turn, are believed to be influenced by Albert Wohlstetter, a controversial nuclear tactician and critic of many U.S. arms-control efforts.    Mr. Wohlstetter has stressed moving away from the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD, which holds that the simple possession of massive nuclear arsenals makes starting a nuclear war unthinkable for either superpower. He has argued instead for a more mobile, less vulnerable nuclear force that could survive nuclear attack and be used to fight back, and he has been a leader in the effort to tap the SDI program for limited anti-missile defenses that can be quickly put in place.    Mr. Quayle's Senate record indicates he is interested in shaping such an American military structure. He has been most prominent as a leading skeptic of President Reagan's treaty with the Soviets banning intermediate-range nuclear weapons.    He was particularly concerned that the accord might interfere with plans the U.S. and its West European allies have to reduce but modernize their shorter-range, tactical nuclear forces in Europe. Moreover, he raised concerns that the pact might unintentionally ban medium-range weapons that carry exotic technologies such as microwaves and lasers.    On &quot;futuristic&quot; weapons and the modernization of tactical nuclear forces, Sen. Quayle extracted clarifications that at least partly addressed his concerns and he ultimately voted to ratify the pact.    More broadly, questions raised by Mr. Quayle and a handful of other lawmakers are generally believed to have slowed the Reagan administration's drive for a far more important treaty cutting strategic weapons by 50%, a drive that conservatives feared was turning into a dangerously hasty rush to an agreement.    Mr. Quayle has pushed hard for low-flying, highly mobile cruise missiles, and helped win assurances that arms negotiators won't restrict non-nuclear cruise missiles in a new arms treaty.    And he has pushed hard for rapid deployment of President Reagan's SDI, even advocating incremental deployment of components of a system. He also has echoed one of Mr. Wohlstetter's ideas by calling for establishment of &quot;self-defense zones&quot; in outer space, where each superpower would be free to attack anything that intrudes near its satellites.    He was one of the first in Congress to call attention to the spread of ballistic missiles to Third World countries and pushed for a new initiative to improve West Europe's conventional and nuclear forces.    Overall, Mr. Quayle's record suggests he may be more enthusiastic about Star Wars and more skeptical about arms control than Mr. Bush. The young senator mightn't have the stature to push a Bush administration in his direction, but his nomination ensures that the positions he has advanced will get a hearing. </TEXT></DOC>
