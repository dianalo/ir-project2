He's not alone. Leaders of both major political partiesand almost every established organization in the state, fromthe Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO, believe voters may beprepared to take a first step -- raising taxes to repair thestate's crumbling transportation system.</LP><TEXT>   California, where the Great Tax Rebellion began 12 yearsago, may once again be a bellwether. Nervous politicians inWashington, locked in budget negotiations, will be watchingto see what voters do here June 5. That's when Californiansgo to the polls to decide if the state gasoline tax should bedoubled to 18 cents a gallon as part of an $18.5 billionpackage to fix the highways and to introduce moreCalifornians to mass transit.   Current revenue clearly can't support such projects. Gov.George Deukmejian announced last week that the state faces a$3.6 billion shortfall in revenues for the fiscal year thatbegins July 1. California, unlike the federal government, isrequired to balance its books; that means that without newrevenue, the state faces crippling cuts in the services itprovides.   If it passes, and that's no sure bet, the ballot proposal,called Proposition 111, won't solve California's budget woes,but proponents tout it as a helpful start.   &quot;It accomplishes what it's supposed to accomplish,&quot; saidMr. Royalty. &quot;I'm for it.&quot; Mr. Royalty has the kind of highpersonal expectations from Proposition 111 its supportershope thousands of others will share. He lives 20 miles fromhis job, but some days it takes him 1 1/2 hours to get there.   Proposition 111, one of 17 proposals on the June 5 ballot,does more than just raise the gasoline tax nine cents (inphases, starting with a nickel). It also lifts the spendinglimits imposed in 1979 by the so-called Gann initiative, akey victory in the state's tax revolt. That has broaderimplications. It means that if Proposition 111 were appliedto the current fiscal year, state spending could be increasedat least $500 million. California's budget problem is thatrevenues are growing about 6% a year but fixed program costsare growing about 11% a year.   Proposition 111 is joined on the ballot by otherpropositions that would authorize the state to issue morethan $4 billion in general revenue bonds for new passengerrail systems, low-income housing, new prisons, new school andcollege construction, and earthquake protection for oldstate-owned buildings. Most of these propositions were put onthe ballot by the Legislature.   No one -- not Republican Pete Wilson or Democrats DianneFeinstein and John Van de Kamp, the gubernatorial candidates-- proposes the elimination of the Gann spending limits. Butthey all support Proposition 111 as one way to spend more,especially in targeted areas the voters seem ready toapprove.   It is, a small band of critics suggests, the camel's noseunder the tent.   &quot;Proposition 111 is the first necessary step for an agendaof ever greater taxes in California,&quot; contended ArthurLaffer, a La Jolla economic consultant and supply-side guru.&quot;It will virtually destroy the restraining power of the Gannlimit.&quot;   What's happening here is a mini-drama running concurrentlywith a larger showdown in Washington, where Democraticcongressional leaders are locked in budget negotiations withPresident Bush, who has given hints that he may be willing toback down on his promise that he wouldn't support new taxes.   If Californians are ready to raise their taxes -- here inthe state where the anti-tax fever began -- maybe, it isthought, nervous politicians elsewhere can emerge from theirhiding holes and vote for new spending.   Maybe. This is a ballot proposal supported by all thegenerals, and nobody really knows what the troops down in thetrenches think. It could be defeated, and legislators wouldthen lose heart. In any scenario, given the fact that programcosts are growing faster than revenues and a ceiling onspending will continue to exist, legislators would be forcedto cut deeply into vulnerable state services.   But if Proposition 111 goes down, panic is the likelyresult among elected leaders. Alan Post, for many years thestate's leading budget analyst, fears things might get so badthat schools and universities would be forced to close theirdoors for part of the school year. &quot;It's getting awfullyrough,&quot; he said.   Californians, 30 million of them now, were once the goldenoptimists in U.S. society. But now they feel buffeted bychange, and most of them don't like it. &quot;It doesn't matterwho they vote for,&quot; said Mervin Field, the pollster, &quot;becausethey still see crime increasing, the war on drugs being lost,educational standards going down, the environment morefouled, housing becoming less affordable, health care morecostly, transportation in gridlock, homelessness increasing.&quot;   It is a state that will have a non-white majority early inthe next century, but blacks, Hispanics and Asians aren'tvery active participants in the political process. Those whogo to the polls tend to be older, more educated and to havehigher incomes, according to Mr. Field.   And, he added, &quot;the more that nonvoters become differentfrom voters in color, in class, and attitudes toward life, wecreate and build threatening pressures which could easilyexplode and alter for the worse the future course of ourprecious democracy.&quot;   &quot;It is only the elites who are still voting,&quot; said formerGov. Jerry Brown, now the Democratic state chairman.   Because of that, Mr. Brown argued with echoes of hiscampaign rhetoric, &quot;both the Democrats and the Republicanshave fixated on anti-government and anti-taxation as theirpolitical mantra. It's brought them success. It means thatanything that would expand the state's social welfare isundervalued.&quot;   Thus, unable to agree about very much among themselves,the state's political leaders, individually and collectively,go about their business by writing propositions instead oflegislation and permit what's left of the electorate todecide the results.   Mr. Laffer remains confident about this Californiaelectorate. He believes the California tax rebellion is aliveand well and that voters will reject higher taxes andincreased spending. If they don't, he warned, property valueswill collapse and the state's unemployment rate, currently5.3%, will rise 1 1/2 percentage points. &quot;The power to tax,&quot;he said, &quot;is the power to destroy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
