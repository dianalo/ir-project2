SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The handicapped are losing earning powerbecause those who do manage to find jobs often get low-levelpositions with little chance for advancement, says a disabledVietnam veteran from South Dakota.   Disabled men earned 64 percent as much as male employees ingeneral in 1987, while disabled women made 62 percent of the amountearned by all female workers, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.   That was down from 77 percent for handicapped men and 69 percentfor disabled women in 1980, the report said.   One major reason, speculated Gene Murphy of Sioux Falls, S.D., isthat handicapped workers are often placed in a limited type of joband simply left there.   ``Companies say, well, how can he ever move up. They give him ajob in the back room, sorting mail, and they don't ever look at himagain. He isn't reviewed when they advance other employees,'' saidMurphy, a disabled Vietnam veteran who directs the South Dakotaoffice of Disabled American Veterans.   Many companies are leery of hiring the disabled, he added, notingthat companies may fear having to spend money on specialaccommodations or that the worker will be out sick a lot.   That may be partly why the employment rate among the disabled hasalso declined in the 1980s, Murphy speculated. ``It's harder for thereally disabled veteran or individual to become employed.''   Other factors in that drop could include concern by thehandicapped over losing their Medicare and Medicaid benefits, andthe lack of strong laws encouraging hiring the disabled, said PaulHippolitus, director of plans, projects and services for thePresident's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped.   For disabled men, the share working full-time fell from 29.8percent in 1981 to 23.4 percent in 1988, the Census Bureau reported.Disabled women increased slightly, with 11.4 percent workingfull-time in 1981, growing to 13.1 percent in 1988.   Part-time disabled male workers dropped from 41.9 percent to 35.8percent; part-time female workers rose from 23.5 percent to 27.5percent.   Laws mandating equal employment for the disabled do not cover allemployers and have failed to have a major impact, Hippolitus said ina telephone interview.   As to the relative income decline, Hippolitus agreed with Murphythat many companies ``think only in terms of entry-level positions(for the disabled) and tend to leave them there.''   ``People with disabilities have the greatest problems with upwardmobility and career advancement. They are perceived as fitting intosome particular area but not as moving up. As everybody else movesup the career ladder they don't,'' Hippolitus said.   The Census Bureau study, the first to compare the employment ofdisabled people over time, does not include explanations for thechanges in income and employment. It is based on the CurrentPopulation Survey, which conducts interviews with about 60,000households every month.   The report classified people as disabled if they reported ahealth problem that prevented them from working or limited the typesof work they could do, but it did not specify particular types ofdisabilities. The study covered people ages 16 to 64.   Average earnings of disabled males rose from $12,579 in 1980 to$15,497 in 1987, but in the same period earnings of all male workersclimbed from $16,362 to $24,095.   For disabled women, earnings rose from $5,335 to $8,075 whileearnings of all women went from $7,770 to $13,000.   The years used to compare employment rates differ slightly fromthose used to compare income because, while people were asked abouttheir disabilities at the time of the study, they were asked to listtheir earnings in the prior year.   The employment figures for the disabled in 1988 also disclosedthat blacks were most likely to be disabled, at 13.7 percent,compared with 8.2 percent of Hispanic Americans and 7.9 percent ofwhites.</TEXT></DOC>
