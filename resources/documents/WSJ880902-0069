It could only have been a matter of time before they had their own convention.    This weekend, 200 exhibitors here will seek to entertain thousands of youngsters while also enticing their parents to buy everything from water-purification systems to invisible dog &quot;fences.&quot;    The All About Kids convention is the brainchild of developmental psychologist Earladeen D. Badger, who figured it would be fun for children and informative for parents. Corporate sponsors eagerly obliged. &quot;We identified a good market,&quot; Ms. Badger says. &quot;Everyone's dying to get at their money.&quot; About 50,000 area residents are expected to attend, with proceeds going to the Children's Hospital Medical Center here.    The difficult part, it seems, has been to get the companies (which are used to deadly dull trade shows) to come up with something more imaginative than passing out balloons or pompons. If they couldn't, Ms. Badger helped. Apple Computer Inc., for example, suggested bringing in several computers and letting their own sales representatives teach the children. Ms. Badger vetoed that. &quot;If they taught it, it would be boring,&quot; she says. Instead she recruited a group of computer whiz kids from local schools to handle the instruction.    The corporate sponsors are trying to be discreet -- more or less. PaineWebber Inc. is providing a castle, and while the children play and have their pictures taken, representatives of the investment concern will corner parents to talk about -- you guessed it -- certificates of deposit. Campbell Soup Co., eager for more young soup slurpers, is setting up a tiny soup kitchen. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. plans to let kids call their grandparents.    For some companies, the link between services and kids is a bit more obtuse. Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric Co. is hosting a show featuring Dudley the Dragon who lives in a kingdom where the only energy source is dragon breath. Prince Want-not from Wasterville triggers an energy crisis by overworking the dragons, and the problem isn't resolved until Princess Penny Wise from Saver City teaches the foolish prince how to conserve.    Politically conscious six-year-olds haven't been forgotten. Among the exhibitors are Greenpeace, Sane/Freeze and the Sierra Club. Ostensibly, they teach kids to respect nature. They're also &quot;trying to persuade parents that they're good organizations to donate to,&quot; Ms. Badger says. </TEXT></DOC>
