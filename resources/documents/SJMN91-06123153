Lawhopes that the normal cells will provide the gene the boy needs and that hismuscles will become stronger.;    Law said that if the boy has no immediateundesirable side effects from the treatment, he will treat 29 other children.;   A second boy will have the muscle cell injections today or Friday. It cantake six months before it is clear whether the injections work and thechildren have stronger leg muscles, Law said. None of the children will becharged for the treatment, he said.;    The boys' families asked that they notbe identified until the treatment had been administered.;    Some researchersand the Muscular Dystrophy Association think Law is moving ahead too fast.;   Saying they are trying to protect patients and their families from false hopesand broken dreams, the critics urge that more preliminary research on thetreatment's safety be completed.;    They stress that cell therapy isextremely promising and that Law and others have obtained exciting hints frompreliminary experiments that the method might work. But, they say, it willprobably be two years before the method is ready to treat patients.;    ButLaw argues that desperate patients, suffering from a relentlessly progressiveand fatal disease for which there is no treatment, cannot afford to wait.;   The agonizing choice involves determining how much of a shortcut can be takenwith patients who have no other option and are willing to bear the risk ofexperimental treatments.;    This is an issue already confronted by peoplewith AIDS, who have argued that they should be allowed to decide when andwhether they want to try new treatments.;    But the muscular dystrophysituation has an added nuance. Because the patients are children who cannotdecide for themselves, and because parents hardly could be expected to turndown a chance to help their children, some ethicists argue that researchersmust be especially cautious when they design their studies.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910502  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  394  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 2, 199100123153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
