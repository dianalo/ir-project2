Sources said the ministers, who comprise the 13-nation cartel'sprice monitoring committee, heard a pessimistic account of theworld oil market from Subroto, the organization's Indonesiansecretary general.   The group did not issue a statement following the gathering,which included a one-hour formal meeting, according to one OPECsource.   ``We heard a long report on the state of the market, which isnot very good,'' said a senior OPEC delegate, who asked not to befurther identified.   Ministers from the five members of the Price Evolution Committee_ Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia, Saudia Arabia and Venezuela _ wereto meet informally for a closed-door dinner at the Saudi ArabianEmbassy later Sunday and hold another round of formal discussionsMonday morning.   The talks, which analysts have predicted would not produce anydramatic results, are taking place amid a crude oil market slumpthat stems largely from a production spurt by nations in theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The committee cannot take any binding decisions on its own, butcan recommend that a full meeting of the organization be calledbefore its scheduled fall session scheduled on Nov. 21 in Vienna,to consider ways to stem production and shore up internationalcrude prices.   The Paris-based International Energy Agency says OPEC wasproducing 19 million barrels a day in August, considerably over the15.06-million-barrel ceiling the group had agreed to for the periodfrom June through the end of the year. That quota did not includeproduction by OPEC member Iran.   Oil prices have hit their lowest levels since the summer of1986, when they fell below $10 a barrel.   North Sea Brent crude was quoted at $13.30 a barrel on Friday,up slightly from the beginning of the week in the wake of news ofthe two-day meeting. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, theNovember contract for the benchmark grade of U.S. crude fell 47cents to $14.18 a barrel on Friday.   According to analysts, at issue in the talks is the failure ofnearly all OPEC members to respect production quotas established inan attempt to maintain the price of oil at $18 a barrel.   OPEC Chairman and Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, who isattending the Madrid meeting, said last week in Indonesia the groupwould examine overproduction and cooperation between OPEC andnon-OPEC producers.   Algeria has complained to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producersthat failure to respect the quotas is causing serious hardships forother OPEC members whose economies are dependent on oil revenue.   Since the last price committee meeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne,Switzerland, a cease-fire in the eight-year Gulf War between Iranand Iraq has begun to hold. Both nations reportedly have stepped upproduction to earn more money for carrying out massivereconstruction projects.   During Sunday's meeting, Subroto welcomed Venezuela's new oilminister Julio Cesar Gil to his first formal OPEC event.   In addition to Lukman and Gil, oil ministers attending themeeting are Algeria's Belkacem Nabi, Indonesia's GinandjarKartasasmita and Saudi Arabia's Hishan Nazer.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
