(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   David and James Taggart lied when theysaid PTL founder Jim Bakker authorized them to take ministry moneythey used to buy property and jewelry, a prosecutor said Mondaybefore deliberations began in the Taggarts' tax evasion trial.   The jury started deliberations just after 5 p.m. on the 12th dayof the trial. Jurors left after three hours and were to resumeTuesday.   ``In a nutshell, this case is about power,'' prosecutor DavidBrown said in his closing statement in the brothers' trial. ``Thepower David Taggart and his brother exercised at PTL to line theirown pockets.''   The Taggarts are charged with evading $525,000 in income taxesafter spending nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personalluxuries such as condominums, jewelry, expensive cars and designerclothes. The trial began July 5.   If convicted, each brother could be sentenced to 25 years inprison and face fines of more than $1 million.   The defense rested Thursday following two days of testimony fromthe Taggarts, who began at PTL as piano players. U.S. DistrictJudge Robert Potter gave no reasons for then postponing Friday'ssession.   Within a few years of joining PTL in the late 1970s, DavidTaggart, 32, was Bakker's top personal aide. James, 35, was theinterior designer at PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat justsouth of Charlotte.   Before his closing remarks, defense attorney Ben Cotten placeditems from such exclusive New York stores as Cartier and Gucci on abench in front of the jury. ``If what is on trial here is alifestyle you don't like, then we didn't need a trial at all,'' hesaid.   Brown told the jury that the government's case was made moredifficult by some of the witnesses _ including the two defendants.   ``If you're not offended by the evidence of how they spent themoney they took from PTL ... you should be offended by the factthat both defendants got on the stand and lied,'' Brown said.   He said there was ample evidence to support the government'scase.   David Taggart showed ``audacity and greed'' when he testified hewas entitled to be paid at a level similar to Bakker.   ``Jim Bakker never authorized it, never, not once. David Taggarttook the stand and lied to you and David Taggart and James Taggartconspired to take money from PTL and not pay taxes on it,'' Brownsaid. He referred to Taggart's testimony that he had authority fromBakker to take large cash advances and use PTL blank checks.   David Taggart testified last week that his way of accounting forthe $1.2 million was to submit documentation to justify it, receivea tax form from PTL that called the cash advances income or thatthe cash advances would be considered a loan which would beconverted into a bonus.   Cotten used his closing arguments to return to testimony about averbal agreement he said was reached between David Taggart andBakker in 1983. He asked the jurors not to dismiss the agreementsimply because it was an oral contract.   Cotten said Bakker agreed to give David Taggart access to thesame resources he enjoyed. ``The intent was not to beat the IRS outof money. It was to have PTL shoulder the burden,'' Cotten said.'</TEXT></DOC>
