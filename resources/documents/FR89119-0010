Commentswere received from one Federal agency and one Federal employee. The Federal agency, which creates and has custody of a large quantity ofclassified and sensitive unclassified documents, recommended that the proposedandSection; 1228.180(c)(2)(ii) be eliminated. As we pointed out in the preambleto the proposed rule, the proposed paragraph (c) is a restatement of theprocedures currently contained in andSection; 1228.180(b). No substantivechanges are made to these procedures, which reflect the statutory requirementsof 44 U.S.C. 2108. We cannot delete andSection; 1228.180(c)(2)(ii), as suggestedby the Federal agency, because that would result in a regulation contraryto 44 U.S.C. 2108. However, we have included additional information whichshould clarify the handling of classified and other sensitive informationcontained in records over 30 years old. We have deleted the reference to GRS item number in andSection; 1228.180(a)(2)(ii)(B)since the recently issued revised General Records Schedules no longer coverany permanent records. The comment from the Federal employee supported the proposed rule withoutchange.This rule is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291of February 17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, itis hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on small business entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 1228</ITAG>Archives and records.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Chapter XIII of Title 36 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1228_DISPOSITION OF FEDERAL RECORDS</ITAG>1. The authority citation for Part 1228 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>44 U.S.C. chapters 21, 29, and 31.</ITAG>2. Section 1228.180 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1228.180</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authority.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Transfer of records. </T3>The Archivist of the United States is authorizedby 44 U.S.C. 2107 to:(1) Accept for deposit with the National Archives of the United Statesthe records of a Federal agency or of the Congress determined by the Archivistof the United States to have sufficient historical or other value to warranttheir continued preservation by the U.S. Government; and(2) Direct and effect the transfer to the National Archives of the UnitedStates of Federal agency records that have been in existence for more than30 years and that have been determined by the Archivist of the United Statesto have sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continuedpreservation by the U.S. Government, unless the head of the agency whichhas custody of the records certifies in writing to the Archivist that therecords must be retained in agency custody for use in the conduct of theregular current business of the agency. Records that are scheduled in aNARA-approved records schedule to be transferred to the National Archivesof the United States after a specified period of time are subject to thecertification requirement only if the records are not transferred as scheduled.(i) In order to certify that records must be retained for the conduct ofregular current business, an agency should consider the following factors:(A) Character of use (to be retained by an agency, records should be usedfor the normal routine business of the agency at the time of certification);(B) Frequency of use (to be retained by an agency, records should be usedmore than one time per month per file unit); and, (C) Preservation of the records (to be retained by an agency, permanentlyvaluable records should be preserved in accordance with NARA guidelines).(ii) The written certification of need of a series of 30-year-old recordsfor current agency business must:(A) Include a comprehensive description and location of records to be retained;(B) Cite the NARA approved authority for the disposition of the recordsif scheduled (SF 115 item number);(C) Describe the current business for which the records are required;(D) Estimate the length of time the records will be needed by the agencyfor current business (if no date is provided by the agency, approved certificationrequests will be effective for a maximum of five years);(E) Explain why the current needs of the agency cannot be met by the servicesNARA provides for records deposited with the National Archives of the UnitedStates; and,(F) If the records are being retained to enable the agency to provide routinepublic reference, cite the statute authorizing this agency activity.(iii) NARA will not accept an agency certification that a specific bodyof records over 30 years old, regardless of physical form or characteristics,is being used for the ``conduct of the regular current business,'' if thatagency is retaining such records primarily to:(A) Provide to persons outside the agency access which can be providedby NARA; or(B) Function as an agency archives, unless specifically authorized by statuteor NARA.(b) <T3>Custody of records transferred.</T3> Under 44 U.S.C. 2108, the Archivistof the United States is responsible for the custody, use, and withdrawalof records transferred to him.(c) <T3>Transferred records subject to statutory or other restrictions.</T3>(1) When records, the use of which is subject to statutory limitationsand restrictions, are so transferred, permissive and restrictive statutoryprovisions concerning the examination and use of records applicable tothe head of the transferring agency are applicable to the Archivist ofthe United States and the employees of the National Archives. (2) Before records are transferred to the National Archives, the headof an agency may state in writing restrictions that appear to him or herto be necessary or desirable in the public interest on the use or examinationof records. The head of an agency must, however, justify and cite the statuteor Freedom of Information Act exemption (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorizesplacing restrictions on the use or examination of records being consideredfor transfer. If the Archivist agrees, restrictions will be placed on therecords.(i) <T3>For records less than 30 years old.</T3> Unless required by law, theArchivist will not remove or relax restrictions placed upon records lessthan 30 years old without the concurrence in writing of the head of theagency from which the material was transferred or of his or her successor,if any. If the transferring agency has been terminated and there is nosuccessor in function, the Archivist is authorized to relax, remove orimpose restrictions in the public interest.(ii) <T3>For records 30 or more years old.</T3> After the records have beenin existence for 30 years or more, statutory or other restrictions referredto in this section shall expire unless the Archivist determines, afterconsulting with the head of the transferring agency, that the restrictionsshall remain in force for a longer period. Such restrictions may be extendedby the Archivist beyond 30 years only for reasons consistent with standardsestablished in relevant statutory law, including the Freedom of InformationAct (5 U.S.C. 552). Restrictions are systematically extended beyond 30years where agencies advise NARA on the transferring document (now a StandardForm 258) that a particular category of records requires such protection.NARA has identified specific categories of records, including classifiedinformation and information that would invade the privacy of an individual,which may require extended protection beyond 30 years. <T3>See</T3> 36 CFR Part 1256.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Claudine J.
