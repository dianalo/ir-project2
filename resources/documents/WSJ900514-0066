There are signs of life on a broad front: A handful of newtechnology issues are the darlings of the season. There hasbeen a spate of &quot;reverse LBOs&quot; -- with mixed results -- bycompanies returning to the public market after the leveragedbuy-outs of years past.</LP><TEXT>   Energy companies have fueled new interest, as have somemedical technology (but not biotechnology) companies. Publicofferings of foreign stocks may be coming into vogue,investment bankers say.   &quot;Only the better deals are going public&quot; nowadays, saysRobert Natale, editor of Standard andamp; Poor's Emerging andSpecial Situations newsletter. Many issues seem to be pricedmore moderately than in precrash days.   So far this year 71 companies have made their initialpublic offerings, up from 46 last year, according toSecurities Data Co. The total market value of these companiesgoing public rose to $2.5 billion from $1.4 billion. (Thefigures don't include initial public offerings of investmentfunds.)   Companies going public are, on average, smaller than inthe pre-crash era.   &quot;We're seeing a decent flow of business,&quot; says SorrellMathes, managing director in charge of equity origination forMerrill Lynch Capital Markets. He says the first four monthsof 1990 rank as the fourth-most active year for initialpublic offerings since 1982, excluding the publicly tradedinvestment companies known as closed-end funds.   &quot;I don't see any areas that are just dead,&quot; Mr. Mathessays. &quot;I've always thought and continue to think that the IPOmarket is a subset of the general market. Industries whichare considered to be a good place to invest are a good placeto do&quot; initial public offerings.   Fleer Corp. may give investors something to chew on nextmonth when the Philadelphia maker of baseball cards andDubble Bubble gum goes public to pare debt it amassed lastyear in a leveraged buy-out. Fleer is one of the morepromising &quot;reverse LBOs&quot; to appear on the initial publicoffering landscape this year, analysts say. As companiestaken private during the era of leveraged buy-outs mature,more of them will come to the public stock markets in searchof debt relief, according to investment bankers.   This year's round of reverse leveraged buy-outs has been amixed bag, Mr. Natale points out, with many companies goingpublic at the low end or below their anticipated price range.   Safeway sold a 10% stake to the public at $11.25 a share,22% below the midpoint of the previously estimated range of$13 to $16. Pinkerton went public at $14 a share; itsanticipated price was $14 to $16 a share.   Geneva Steel went public in March at $10 a share, wellbelow the initially promoted range of $14 to $16 a share.   But Sandamp;P's Mr. Natale says Fleer may be more successful.   Once a family-owned company, Fleer was purchased in Augustin a leveraged acquisition by Charterhouse Equity Partners,according to Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., soleunderwriter of the planned initial public offering. Fleerplans to offer 1.7 million shares to the public in early Juneat $11 to $13 each to reduce debt. Debt was $31.3 million andequity was $34.6 million on March 31.   The deal's structure appeals to Mr. Natale. &quot;Their debtwill be less than half of the committed capital after theoffering,&quot; he says. At a midpoint of $12 a share, Fleer'sshares would go public at slightly more than 11 times Mr.Natale's estimated 1990 earnings of $1.05 a share.   The analyst also likes the fact that Fleer is going publicat a discount to the valuation of its closest rival,baseball-card maker Topps Co. Fleer should reach the publicat 13 times trailing 12-months earnings and one timesrevenue, he says, compared with Topps' trading price of 17times trailing earnings and 2.6 times revenue. Although Toppshas higher profit margins than Fleer, the latter'sbaseball-card sales are growing at a faster rate, he adds.   While reverse leveraged buy-outs may be emerging as atrend, &quot;the technology deals are catching the wave,&quot; says Mr.Natale. Specialty companies that fill niches intelecommunications and computer technology are doing well.For instance, Telebit, a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of modemsfor sending data over telephone lines, closed Friday at 121/4; it went public April 26 at $10 a share.   Aspect Telecommunications, a San Jose, Calif., maker oftransaction processing systems, went public May 2 at $14.50 ashare, above the anticipated range of $11 to $13 a share. Itclosed Friday at 15 3/4.   Investment bankers say more international companies may becoming to the U.S. equities markets for capital. Mr. Mathesof Merrill Lynch points to Luxottica Group, an Italian makerof eyeglass frames that went public in January at $19 foreach American depositary receipt. Luxottica's ADRs closedFriday at 23 3/4.   New issues of biotechnology companies have given way toofferings of medical technology and service concerns.Pharmacy Management Services, a Tampa, Fla., provider ofmedical cost-containment services, closed Friday at 17 1/2,up from an April offering at $12 a share.   Sullivan Dental Products, a West Allis, Wis., marketer ofdental supplies, ended the week at 16, well ahead of its$10-a-share initial public offering in mid-April. On theother hand, Tokos Medical, a provider of home-health-careservices, closed at 9 1/2, down from an initial publicoffering at $12-a-share in late March.   Among new energy companies are three oil and gasexploration and production concerns that are trading belowtheir offering prices of more than two months ago. Cabot Oilandamp; Gas, 14 5/8, went public at $16.75 a share; Hadson EnergyResources, 10 3/4, was offered at $13; and Santa Fe EnergyResources, 17, was issued at $18.25.   Faring better is an oil and gas service company, PoolEnergy Services, at 13 1/4, up from its offering price of 101/4 in mid-April. Other new energy-service companies includeTeppco Partners, 18 7/8, down from a $20-a-share offeringprice; and Tuboscope, 8 1/8, off its initial public offeringprice of 8 1/2.   Analysts and investment bankers say they expect theinitial public offering business to remain steady, ending theyear slightly stronger than 1989. Of course, they add, thisyear's demand can't compare with 1987, when Mr. Natalecalculates there were 337 new issues at $5 a share or higher,valued at a total of $23 billion. But given today's moresober environment, &quot;the new issues market is doing reasonablywell,&quot; he says.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The over-the-counter market surged Friday on optimism overinterest rates.
