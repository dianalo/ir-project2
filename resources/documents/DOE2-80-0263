It is concludedthat the X-ray flux due to electron precipitation depends strongly ongeomagnetic activity, reaching at Sao Jose dos Campos a maximum dowardflux of 10/sup -2/ photons/cm/sup 2/.sec.KeV for 4g/cm/sup 2/ and forthe energy range of 30-150KeV. The related flux of precipitating electronswas computed by Monte Carlo method with values of about 500 electrons/cm/sup2/.sec and energy espectra of the type e/sup -T/200/. This electron fluxis shown to represent the main ionization flux for the atmosphere atabout 60 Km height. Furthermore, the atmospheric and diffuse componentswere determined at balloon altitudes (approximately 5g/cm/sup 2/) ofSao Jose dos campos ({lambda}/sub m/ = 11/sup 0/S) to be of the sameorder.</TEXT></DOC>
