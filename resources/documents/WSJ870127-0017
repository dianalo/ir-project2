The showing brought the Greens a stepcloser to their dream of changing the direction of Germansociety.   For the weakened Social Democratic Party, Sunday's election revived the temptation to form an opposition alliance with a movement it had previously rejected as too militant and unreliable.    For the victorious ruling coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose own Christian Democratic Union put on its worst electoral performance in nearly four decades, the Greens' success sent a powerful message that he must do more to ease popular worry about the environment.    And for the Greens themselves, the gains widened the opportunity to press their vision of a neutralist, pacifist Germany just seven years after their birth as a political party.    &quot;The Greens must grow, and to grow you always need time,&quot; says Joschka Fischer, a 38-year-old former student revolutionary and the first member of Greens party to hold an official government post as minister for the environment and energy in the state of Hesse. &quot;Now that we'll get back into the Bundestag for four more years, we'll have time.&quot;    Mr. Fischer, dressed as scruffily as usual in blue jeans, purple sweater and a formless blue flannel shirt, is a potent symbol of the inroads that the Greens have made into West Germany's political establishment. &quot;If you put me in a suit,&quot; he says, &quot;I'll still look like a park-bench punk within three hours.&quot;    Until now, the party hasn't been in a position to have a direct impact on major German policy issues. The Pershing missiles they opposed have been installed; the nuclear power stations they want shut down are still running and party members joke that their greatest success to date in Bonn has been to push through a ban on imports of sea turtles.    Nonetheless, as even some opponents concede, the Greens' presence in Parliament and their growing support in the country have already had a distinct, often unsettling effect on national politics. &quot;We have made the others mimic us,&quot; says Ludger Volmer, a Greens member of parliament.    Kurt Biedenkopf, a leading member of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats, agrees. &quot;The Greens have helped to change the priorities of the big parties,&quot; he has said. Issues that were formerly in the background &quot;have been pushed strongly into the forefront.&quot;    The Greens' popular appeal is a deeply worrying prospect for many of Germany's allies, businessmen and politicians. The party's program is as confused and contradictory as the diverse elements that comprise it. But the members do share a common ideal of a country in which the nuclear power stations which provide one-third of the electricity are switched off, where the police are disarmed and the intelligence agencies disbanded.    &quot;They want to topple the state,&quot; charges Franz Josef Strauss, the conservative governor of Bavaria and a bitter enemy of the party.    After Sunday's vote, the Greens have become an increasingly uncomfortable opposition presence for the Social Democrats, who are divided over whether to form a coalition with them or go it alone.    While the Greens are a long way from assuming power, some party members like Mr. Fischer hope eventually to wield greater influence through such an alliance. Playing on such fears, Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats used the election campaign to stress the dangers of what they call &quot;Red-Green chaos&quot; (red being the party color of the Social Democrats).    Johannes Rau, the Social Democrat candidate for chancellor, rejected a partnership with the Greens. But there is already one Red-Green coalition in the state of Hesse, which is why Mr. Fischer is a minister. And many Social Democrats, smarting from their party's decline, believe a link with the Greens may be the key to their return to power.    The question of a Greens-Social Democratic alliance was academic this time around, with Chancellor Kohl's ruling coalition winning a comfortable victory. (Although Mr. Kohl's party lost ground, its Free Democratic Party partners gained.)    But longer term, &quot;I think the SPD (Social Democratic Party) is in big danger from the Greens,&quot; says Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, head of the Allensbach polling institute. &quot;They destroy the SPD because they force them to move to the left.&quot;    Others say the Greens have prospered because they seem to have formulated the thoughts and fears of many ordinary Germans. &quot;They have asked the right questions,&quot; Mr. Biedenkopf of the Christian Democrats said recently in a statement that sparked fury among party colleagues. &quot;And asking the right questions is one of the hardest things there is.&quot;    Those questions are principally about the quality of life in a highly industrialized and densely populated West Germany. The Greens have their roots in numerous protest movements of the 1960s and '70s, from anti-Vietnam War demonstrations to animal-rights campaigns, but they have made environmental protection their battle cry.    Of course, issues such as dying forests and air pollution weren't invented by the Greens and were around long before the party existed. But whereas the issues were often neglected or treated half-heartedly by successive ruling governments in Bonn, the Greens' presence in the Bundestag has now pushed them to the top of the political agenda.    It's perhaps typical of the topsy-turvy Greens that their influence is increasing in the midst of major internal rifts. The main point of contention is whether to accept political power and responsibility.    One strong faction, known in Green jargon as the Realos, or pragmatists, argues the need to change society from within by grabbing power wherever possible. The other faction, the Fundis, or fundamentalists, believes the Greens should remain a protest group that fights the system from the outside.    A focal point for their arguments has become the question of whether to join forces with the Social Democrats. But the two sides also argue over everything from policy to trivia. Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a former student rebel and well known party member, has remarked wryly, &quot;People vote for the Greens in spite of the Greens.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
