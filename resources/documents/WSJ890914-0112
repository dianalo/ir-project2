A spokesman for DD Acquisition Corp., which is jointly held by Unicorp Canada and Cara Operations, said the company doesn't intend to increase its bid of $45 a share, or $268 million, for Dunkin' Donuts, but left open the possibility of a higher offer. No decision can be made &quot;until we see what's in the information,&quot; he said. &quot;Give us a week and we'll be able to come up with something by then.&quot; He said the company hopes to meet with Goldman Sachs by early next week.    Dunkin' Donuts said it signed confidentiality agreements with several parties, including DD Acquisition, that are interested in pursuing discussions concerning the acquisition of the Randolph, Mass., company. On Monday, Dunkin' Donuts rejected DD Acquisition's offer and instructed Goldman Sachs to explore ways to maximize shareholder value, including an acquisition of the company by a third party.    DD Acquisition has agreed to keep its tender offer open at least until Nov. 1. In addition, the parties have agreed to postpone Monday's trial in pending Delaware litigation and to suspend that litigation until at least Nov. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
