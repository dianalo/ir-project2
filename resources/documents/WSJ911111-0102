Few experts in the pressor academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrecttopic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue andbecame a political force.   General population polls conducted by Gordon BlackAssociates in 1984 and by the National Opinion ResearchCenter in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has beeninjured by affirmative action. This figure alone adds up tomillions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even largernumbers.</LP><TEXT>   Preferential policies were instituted during an intenselycompetitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded jobmarkets increasingly constrained by internationalcompetition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and taxrevolts. Thus, affirmative action often occurred in zero-sumcontexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.   My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bitehas varied by age, geography, occupation, and private orpublic sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector whitemen under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Theirphone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.   Many more white men may not have been fully aware thatthey were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as&quot;race-norming&quot; of employment tests by public testingagencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recentlystopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Norhave they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses toaffirmative action hiring and promotion records.   I became curious about the impact of affirmative actionwhile working in the increasingly quota-crazy highereducation systems of California -- where policies moved farbeyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race couldbe considered as one of several factors in selectionprocesses.   During the 1980s, a state mandate for the communitycollege system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring&quot;goal&quot; until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror theethnic diversity of the entire state; the University ofCalifornia began advertising &quot;targets of diversity&quot; facultypositions and substantially boosted minority-femalerepresentation in administrative staff positions to 72%; andthe California State University system implemented set-asidefaculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programsfor graduate students -- while the politically correctfaculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for&quot;underrepresented&quot; junior faculty. And &quot;parity goals&quot; for theentire state work force were monitored in annual reports bythe State Personnel Board.   As my quiet interest in affirmative action leaked out -- aprofessionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues,friends and relative strangers began to report encounterswith reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduateassistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informaldata -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depthinterviews with California-based, mostly middle-class whitemen who reported that preferential policies prevented themfrom obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers.Some findings:   -- A community college instructor repeatedly losttenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities afterhe moved to California from Michigan. &quot;At first, you thinkit's you,&quot; he said. &quot;You blame yourself.&quot; (He finallyobtained an appointment at another college.)   -- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardentliberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched womenhe'd hired the year before move by him on theaffirmative-action fast-track. (Rapid increases in femalemid-management employees in his bank and at others lentcredence to his account.)   -- Public-sector workers reported that affirmative actionbarriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledgedby most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed byminorities or women, one upper-middle-management Californiastate official reported being offered a promotion -- withsome public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescindedbecause, as an agency head told him, &quot;Let's face it, you'renot the right color.&quot;   Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests outof fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist.(No one said he feared being thought sexist.)   Six resigned from the organizations that discriminatedagainst them. Three circumvented reverse discriminationproblems through various organizational means. Three filedsuits, none of which was successful. No government agencyoffered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulateemployers from reverse discrimination complaints if theemployer has taken &quot;reasonable&quot; voluntary affirmative actionto remedy &quot;deficiencies&quot; in minority representation.)   The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in theirtreatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignationor anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term,frustration and cynicism about social institutions. &quot;A lot ofus were sold a bill of goods,&quot; complained a California statemiddle-management worker. &quot;We were told if you went tocollege you could write your own ticket. But . . .affirmative action has lowered standards to the point whereeducation counts against you.&quot;   No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se,but many felt alienated from a society that refused toacknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred toa distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: &quot;Myfriends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitivedissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists.&quot; Anotherteacher noted: &quot;I found out what it was like to be a victim.Nobody likes a victim.&quot;   Research sponsored and then suppressed by the DemocraticParty in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split inwhite reactions to affirmative action. Political analystStanley Greenberg's &quot;Report on Democratic Defections&quot; byblue-collar white &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; in Michigan found furyover quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr.Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of&quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice.&quot;) These data, in combination withthe record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtlyor covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angryworking-class response. This is perhaps because of moreintense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collarjobs market.   Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began toattack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, acurious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open politicalresponse to rank-and-file whites.   Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaintswith swift, categorical denials, such as &quot;white males can'tbe victims.&quot; Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theorytoday embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle.White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regardedas a privileged modern-day &quot;bourgeoisie,&quot; while women andpeople of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroupcircumstances) are the oppressed &quot;proletariat.&quot; Any mentionof a white working class -- once prominently represented inlabor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizationsor with awkward silence.   Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men'scomplaints of reverse discrimination because ofconservatism's rugged individualistic and free-marketunderpinnings. White men injured by affirmative action arelikely to be told to &quot;take it like a man&quot; and get on withtheir lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor theassumption that an injured white man can simply quit theoffending organization and get another job or start his ownbusiness. And there's been more than a hint of class bias.Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic,unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Someright-of-center writers have sneered at &quot;firefighters&quot;(presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain ofreverse discrimination.   The stereotype of &quot;racist&quot; working-class white men hasmade most journalists, academics and politicians fearful ofacquiring a &quot;racist&quot; label themselves if they even raise thewhite-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate overaffirmative action has focused on the safer topics of coststo employers and the stigmatization of officially favoredgroups.   Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites andaffirmative action have been buried. Just as the Greenbergstudies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by theLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provideimpetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. Newsleaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white angertoward affirmative action preferences.   One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized UrbanInstitute study in which matched black/white pairs of jobseekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in13%, both the black and white applicants were offered thejob; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant wasoffered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black receivedthe offer-indicating only minimal levels of reversediscrimination. However, the institute study ignored thepublic sector entirely, as well as people-oriented,liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing todispatch black/white teams to apply for openings inCalifornia state agencies? In universities?   Affirmative action's impact upon white males must also beviewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are tounderstand how these policies have both functioned andmalfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaintsmight have led to the recognition that, in practice,affirmative action has become what George Will has aptlytermed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.   Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it isunjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites'criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppressionwill only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotionalexploitation of an important topic.   ---   Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government atClaremont McKenna College in California, and author of&quot;Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of AffirmativeAction&quot; (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</TEXT></DOC>
