Last year, &quot;we got stiffed byCongress on trying to get the banking reform bill through,and I'm going to try again,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   In November, Congress passed a law that tightened bankregulation and allowed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. toborrow as much as $30 billion to head off insolvency of thebank deposit insurance fund. But Congress failed to enactadministration proposals to allow banks to establishnationwide branch networks, offer new securities andinsurance products, and combine with commercial companies. Inaddition, the administration proposed to limit the number ofinsured $100,000 bank accounts for each depositor.   Mr. Bush didn't make bank legislation a top issue lastyear, and he isn't planning to push hard for it this yeareither. But he wants to blame Congress for failing to makechanges that the administration argues would strengthen thefinancial system at a time when the banking industry isfacing its worst problems since the Depression. The bankingcrisis is acute in New Hampshire, where Mr. Bush is facing aprimary challenge from the right next month.   In his remarks to the home builders association Friday,Mr. Bush said he will continue to fight &quot;over-regulation&quot; bybank examiners, which some bankers and real estate interestsclaim has made banks reluctant to lend.   The budget the administration will unveil this week warnsthat unless Congress allows banks to operate moreefficiently, rising bank failures may ultimately require ataxpayer bailout of the bank deposit insurance fund.   The budget said that without reform, losses to the bankdeposit insurance fund could total about $60 billion in thefive years starting in fiscal 1993, which begins on Oct. 1.The White House Office of Management and Budget estimatesthat the administration's plans would cut losses to $45billion over the period, according to people familiar withthe new budget.   The administration's loss estimate apparently doesn't takeaccount of the recent decline in interest rates, which iseasing the banking crisis. The Congressional Budget Office,for instance, projects bank insurance fund losses of $44billion between fiscal 1993 and 1997.   The budget also will propose an accounting change thatwould permit Congress and the president to finance tax cutsnow by passing legislation that would reduce governmentdeposit-insurance spending in the future, officials say.   There is little chance that an election year Congress willhave the time or inclination to take up measures that provedtoo controversial last year. Nevertheless, theadministration, several large banks and some in Congress willpress for changes to allow banks to set up nationwide branchnetworks, a change that would encourage more bank mergers andallow the banking industry to save billions of dollars a yearthrough consolidation, advocates said.</TEXT></DOC>
