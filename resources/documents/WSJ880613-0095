But Socialist President Francois Mitterrand nevertheless should be able to implement his moderate economic and social program.    With results for nearly all seats declared, computer projections gave both the Socialists and the center-right union, known by its French initials URC, about 275 seats each in the 577-member National Assembly. The Communist Party won about 27 seats, and the extreme right-wing National Front Party won just one. A party would need 289 seats for an absolute majority.    French voters continued to show election fatigue, after being asked to vote four times within the past three months. Only about 70% of those eligible voted, the lowest turnout ever for the second round of a parliamentary election.    The results mean that for the first time since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958, France will have either a coalition or minority government. Most analysts expect the president to rename as prime minister Michel Rocard, but they also forecast that several center-right figures could be offered cabinet posts. Pressure will increase both on Socialists and centrists within the URC to form an alliance in parliament. Mr. Mitterrand has indicated that he doesn't want to enter into an active alliance with the Communists as he did in 1981; last night, Communist leader Georges Marchais ruled out a coalition government.    If a coalition can't be formed, the new government could survive despite a lack of a majority by winning the support of Communist deputies for some laws and that of centrists on others. One possibility was eliminated: Because the URC didn't win a majority, there won't be a return to the &quot;cohabitation&quot; of the past two years, during which conservative Prime Minister Jacques Chirac ran the government under Mr. Mitterrand.    Prime Minister Rocard said it will &quot;take several days&quot; to assess the vote but that the results will allow a government to &quot;carry out the policies&quot; desired by Mr. Mitterrand.    Political leaders agreed that the much-closer-than-expected election resulted from voters seeking a way to ensure a moderate government. &quot;The voters said they want both halves of France to work together,&quot; said former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a leader of the URC. &quot;Perhaps these results have given us a victory against our hereditary enemy: division.&quot;    The election also confirmed the near-extinction of the National Front as a force in parliament. In the 1986 parliamentary election, the party had won 35 seats. Yesterday its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was narrowly defeated in a Marseille constituency.    While Socialist Party leaders were clearly disappointed last night at failing to win the expected absolute majority, the result paradoxically could be the best possible one for Mr. Mitterrand. The president has said repeatedly since beating Mr. Chirac by 54% to 46% in the May 8 presidential election that he wanted to &quot;open up&quot; French politics beyond the traditional left-right divisions.    After the presidential election, Mr. Rocard offered governmental posts to several center-right politicians, only a handful of whom accepted. The president, buoyed by his victory and favorable opinion polls, dissolved parliament to seek an outright majority for his party. Now Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Rocard may be forced to negotiate a common program with centrists in order to get them either to join in a coalition government or to give their support to the Socialists in parliament. Such a program likely wouldn't differ much from Mr. Mitterrand's campaign platform.    The position of the center-right parties in the URC coalition remained unclear last night. Mr. Chirac's Rally for the Republic Party certainly will remain in firm opposition. But smaller parties, such as some centrist forces supporting former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, could be tempted to form independent parliamentary groups that could negotiate with the Socialists. Mr. Barre seemed to open the door to possible cooperation by saying that &quot;France needs a stable majority&quot; supporting the president, and that the president &quot;should choose policies that allow this majority to be formed.&quot;    Exactly what yesterday's results mean for French economic and social policies probably won't be known until the complexion of the new parliament and the possible voting alliances become clear. So far, Mr. Rocard's government has moved to symbolically lift the last remaining controls on the movement of foreign exchange, supported the strength of the franc on exchange markets in order to battle inflation, and halted the outright denationalization of state-owned companies. The government has left open the possibility of allowing as much as 49% shareholder ownership of some state companies. Foreign policy played little or no role in the parliamentary voting. </TEXT></DOC>
