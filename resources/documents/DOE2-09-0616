Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0),forced expiratory volume (FEV25-75), peak expiratory flow, and a tracingof the entire flow curve was monitored before the gas stove was turnedon, during a break in cooking, immediately after, and 1 hr after cookingwas completed. Study design for detection of health effects of the acuteexposures to NO{sub 2} described above and a method of validating findingsin an exposure chamber are discussed in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
