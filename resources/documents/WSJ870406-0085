After many editorials in which you engage in &quot;lawyer bashing&quot; (often misstating facts), is the prestigious Wall Street Journal (editorial &quot;Independent Oxymoron,&quot; March 12) in favor of thwarting the investigation of Messrs. North and Deaver and then using a legalistic argument thought up by (gasp!) a lawyer? After all of the years of complaining about liberal defense counsel and liberal judges allowing criminals to hide behind the protection of the Constitution, is the Journal actually in favor of certain persons (so long as they are ideologically correct, of course) hiding behind the protection of the Constitution?
