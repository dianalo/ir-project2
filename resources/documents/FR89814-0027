Section 102(b) sets an RQ of one poundfor hazardous substances, except those substances for which different RQshave been established pursuant to section 311(b)(4) of the Clean WaterAct (CWA). In addition to these reporting requirements section 304 of theSuperfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III requiresthat releases of hazardous substances in quantities equal to or greaterthan their RQs (or one pound if a reporting trigger is not establishedby regulation) be reported to State and local authorities. Section 102(a) of CERCLA authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA or ``the Agency'') to adjust RQs for hazardous substances and to designateas hazardous substances those substances that, when released into the environment,may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment.Currently there are 725 CERCLA hazardous substances.\1\<NOTE/> In this rulemaking, EPA is promulgating the RQ adjustmentsfor six of the 273 hazardous substances whose RQs were proposed to be adjustedin a March 16, 1987 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).

By making the adjustments contained in this rulemaking,the Agency will be able to focus its resources on those releases whichare most likely to pose potential threats to public health or welfare orthe environment. In addition, by making these adjustments, EPA will relievethe regulated community of the burden of reporting releases which are unlikelyto pose such threats.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ EPA proposed RQ adjustments for the hazardous substanceswhose RQs are promulgated in this final rule on March 16, 1987. As of thatdate, there were 717 CERCLA hazardous substances. Changes to the list ofCERCLA hazardous substances since March 16, 1987 are described below. Fourhazardous waste streams (K123, K124, K125, and K126) were added in a finalrule (51 FR 37725) that became effective on April 24, 1987, bringing thetotal number of CERCLA hazardous substances to 721. EPA removed iron dextranand strontium sulfide from the list in two final rules (53 FR 43878 and53 FR 43881) effective October 31, 1988, thus reducing the number of CERCLAhazardous substances to 719. Six hazardous substances (waste streams K064,K065, K066, K088, K090, and K091) were added to the CERCLA list in a finalrule (53 FR 35412) that became effective on March 13, 1989, increasingthe number of CERCLA hazardous substances to 725, which is the currenttotal. Lastly, based on a final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, ammonium thiosulfate will be removed from theCERCLA list 60 days from today's date, thus reducing the number of CERCLAhazardous substances to 724.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> August 14, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> The toll-free telephone number of the National ResponseCenter is 1-800/424-8802; in the Washington, DC metropolitan area the numberis 1-202/267-2675. <T3>Docket: </T3>Copies of materials relevant to this rulemaking are containedin Room M2427 at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street,SW, Washington, DC 20460 (Docket Number 102 RQ-273C).

Statutory Authority Section 102(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (Pub. L. 96-510), 42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> as amended by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99-499), establishes reportable quantities(RQs) of one pound for releases of hazardous substances, except for hazardoussubstances whose RQs were established at a different level pursuant tosection 311 of the CWA. Section 102(a) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to adjustall of these RQs by regulation. Sections 103(a) and (b) of CERCLA require that the person in charge ofa vessel or facility notify the National Response Center immediately whenthere is a release of a hazardous substance in an amount equal to or greaterthan the RQ for that substance. This notification requirement serves asa trigger for informing the government of a release so that Federal personnelcan evaluate the need for a Federal removal or remedial action and undertakeany necessary action in a timely fashion. Under section 104 of CERCLA,the Federal government may respond whenever there is a release or substantialthreat of a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Responsesare to be taken, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the NationalOil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR Part 300),which was originally developed under the CWA and which has been revisedto reflect the responsibilities and authority created by CERCLA. If a release meets certain statutory criteria set out in CERCLA section103(f)(2), the release may be subject to more limited reporting requirements.Specifically, a release is subject to these limited requirements if therelease: (1) Is continuous and stable in quantity and rate, and is froma facility for which notification has been given under CERCLA section 103(c),or (2) is a release for which notification has been given under CERCLAsections 103(a) and (b) for a period sufficient to establish continuity,quantity, and regularity of the release. Notification must still be givenannually and when there is a statistically significant increase in therelease. In addition, CERCLA section 103 provides a reporting exemptionfor federally permitted releases. The definition of federally permittedrelease in CERCLA section 101(10) specifically identifies releases permittedunder certain other Federal or State programs. Several commenters claimedthat their particular releases are subject to continuous and/or federallypermitted release treatment. EPA published proposed regulations to clarifythe reduced reporting requirement for continuous releases on April 19,1988 (53 FR 12868). EPA also clarified the reporting exemption for federallypermitted releases in proposed regulations published on July 19, 1988 (53FR 27268). Comments on continuous and federally permitted release issuessubmitted in response to the March 16, 1987 NPRM will be addressed in theupcoming final rules for continuous and federally permitted releases. In addition to the reporting requirements established by CERCLA, section304 of SARA Title III requires the owners and operators of certain facilitiesto report releases of CERCLA hazardous substances to State and local authorities.SARA Title III section 304 notification must be given immediately afterthe release of an RQ or more (one pound or more if a reporting triggeris not established by regulation) to the community emergency coordinatorfor each local emergency planning committee for any area likely to be affectedby the release, and to the State emergency response commission of any Statelikely to be affected by the release. These notification requirements applyonly to releases that have potential for off-site exposure  and that arefrom facilities at which a ``hazardous chemical'' (defined by regulationsunder the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 CFR 1910.1200(c))and section 311 of SARA Title III) is produced, used, or stored. Section 109 of CERCLA and section 325 of SARA Title III authorize EPA toassess civil penalties for failure to report releases of hazardous substancesthat equal or exceed their RQs. Section 103 of CERCLA, as amended, authorizesEPA to seek criminal penalties for submitting false or misleading informationin a notification made pursuant to CERCLA section 103, and increases themaximum penalties and years of imprisonment for violation of the CERCLAsection 103 reporting requirement. B. Background of This Rulemaking On May 25, 1983, EPA proposed a rule (48 FR 23552) to clarify proceduresfor reporting releases of CERCLA hazardous substances and to adjust RQsfor 387 of the then 696 hazardous substances.\2\<NOTE/> In the May 25, 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)EPA also compiled for the first time the list of ``hazardous substances''defined under section 101(14) of CERCLA. In the preamble to that NPRM,EPA discussed in detail the CERCLA notification provisions, the methodologyand criteria used to adjust the RQ levels, and the RQ adjustments proposedunder section 102 of CERCLA and under section 311 of the CWA. EPA promulgatedfinal RQ adjustments for 340 hazardous substances in  an April 4, 1985final rule (50 FR 13456) and for an additional 102 substances in a September29, 1986 final rule (51 FR 34534). In an NPRM published on March 16, 1987(52 FR 8140), EPA proposed RQ adjustments for 273 hazardous substances.The March 16, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> also contained an NPRM in which EPA proposedRQ adjustments for radionuclides.\3\<NOTE/> In addition, in an NPRM published on March 2, 1988 (53 FR6762), EPA reproposed RQ adjustments for lead metal and four lead compounds,and proposed to delist ammonium thiosulfate as a CERCLA hazardous substance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Since the May 25, 1983 NPRM, 31 substances have been addedand two substances have been deleted from the CERCLA list, bringing thetotal number of CERCLA hazardous substances to 725. The 31 substances addedto the list are: waste stream F024 (49 FR 5308); coke oven emissions (49FR 36560); waste streams F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, F027, and F028 (50FR 1978); waste streams K111, K112, K113, K114, K115, and K116, o-toluidineand p-toluidine (50 FR 42936); waste streams K117, K118, and K136 (51 FR5327); 2-ethoxyethanol (51 FR 6537); waste streams K123, K124, K125, andK126 (51 FR 37725); and waste streams K064, K065, K066, K088, K090, andK091 (53 FR 35412). The two substances deleted from the list are: irondextran (53 FR 43878) and strontium sulfide (53 FR 43881). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ RQ adjustments for radionuclides were promulgated in afinal rule published on May 24, 1989 (54 FR 22524). This rulemaking finalizes the RQ adjustments for six of the 273 hazardoussubstances whose RQs were proposed for adjustment in the March 16, 1987NPRM. This rule contains EPA's responses to all issues raised by the commentersrelating to the RQ adjustment methodology for potential carcinogenicity,except those methodology issues not relevant to the six RQ adjustmentspromulgated in this final rule (for further discussion, see Section II.B.2of this preamble). This rule also contains responses to public commentsreceived on the specific RQ adjustments for the hazardous substances inthis rulemaking. Comments were received on the proposed RQ adjustmentsfor only three hazardous substances (1,4-dioxane, perchloroethylene, andsaccharin) of the six hazardous substances for which RQ adjustments arepromulgated in this rule. RQ adjustments for 258 hazardous substances, including 254 of the 273 hazardoussubstances whose RQs were proposed for adjustment in the March 16, 1987NPRM, are contained in a final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. As explained in Section II.C.2.i of the preambleto the other final RQ adjustment rule published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA will  address the RQs for the remaining13 substances of the 273 substances that were the subject of the March16, 1987 NPRM in a future action. Section 306(a) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA section 202, requires theU.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to list and regulate CERCLA hazardoussubstances as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials TransportationAct. Pursuant to this requirement, DOT promulgated on November 21, 1986,a final rule (51 FR 42174) providing that, when a hazardous substance isshipped in a quantity equal to or greater than its RQ, it must be identifiedas such in shipping papers and by package markings. This rule became effectiveon July 1, 1987 (51 FR 46672). The rule requires shippers of hazardoussubstances in quantities at or above their RQs to place the notation ``RQ''and the name of the substance on shipping papers and package markings.RQs for many of the hazardous substances proposed for adjustment in theMarch 16, 1987 NPRM (including the six substances whose adjusted RQs arebeing promulgated today) were proposed to be adjusted upward from theirstatutory RQs. The estimated production volume for the six hazardous substanceswhose adjusted RQs are being promulgated today is 4.6 billion pounds annually.Because this amount represents a relatively large proportion of the totalproduction volume of all 273 hazardous substances proposed for RQ adjustmentin the March 16, 1987 NPRM, many shippers would be subject to a regulatoryburden that is not justified by the hazards that these substances poseto human health and the environment. Once final RQ adjustments are promulgatedfor these six hazardous substances, shippers of less than the adjustedRQ of a substance will not be subject to DOT regulations relating to shippingpapers and package markings. Accordingly, EPA is expediting the promulgationof a final rule adjusting RQs for these substances by making this ruleeffective immediately upon promulgation. Because this rule ``grants orrecognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' under section 553(d)(1)of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the APA requirement that finalrules become effective no less than 30 days after publication does notapply. In finalizing these RQ adjustments, this rule amends Table 302.4 of 40CFR Part 302. Section II of this preamble discusses the RQ adjustmentspromulgated in this rulemaking and the methodology used in making theseadjustments. Section II also includes EPA's responses to public commentson the March 16, 1987 NPRM that are relevant to the six RQ adjustmentsmade in this rule and to the RQ adjustment methodology on which these sixadjustments are based. Section III provides a summary of the analyses supportingthis rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Reportable Quantity Adjustments </ITAG>A. Introduction In this rulemaking, the Agency adjusts RQs based upon specific scientificand technical criteria that relate to the possibility of harm from therelease of a hazardous substance at certain levels. The quantity releasedis but one factor considered by the government when assessing the needto respond to such a release. Other factors, assessed on a case-by-casebasis, include but are not limited to: (1) The location of the release;(2) its proximity to drinking water supplies or other valuable resources;and (3) the likelihood of exposure or injury to nearby populations. TheRQ adjustments made today will enable the Agency to focus its resourceson those releases that are most likely to pose potential threats to publichealth or welfare or the environment. These adjustments will also relievethe regulated community and emergency response personnel from the burdenof making and responding to reports of releases that are unlikely to posesuch threats.In this final rule, the Agency is adjusting RQs for 1,4-dioxane, 2-ethoxyethanol,ethylene oxide, 2-nitropropane, perchloroethylene, and saccharin. Withthe exception of 2-ethoxyethanol (which was not identified as a potentialcarcinogen under the identification methodology discussed in Section II.B.below), all of these hazardous substances have been evaluated for potentialcarcinogenicity as well as other primary criteria. The final RQ adjustmentspromulgated today are based on the results of this evaluation. In the caseof 2-ethoxyethanol, its final RQ adjustment is based on the primary criterionof chronic toxicity (see the discussion below). B. Reportable Quantity Adjustment Methodology <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary of the Methodology </ITAG>The Agency has wide discretion in adjusting the statutory RQs for hazardoussubstances under CERCLA. Administrative feasibility and practicality areimportant considerations. The Agency's methodology for adjusting RQs beginswith an evaluation of the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicologicalproperties of each hazardous substance. The intrinsic properties examined_called``primary criteria''_are aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity (oral, dermal,and inhalation), ignitability, reactivity, chronic toxicity,\4\<NOTE/> and potential carcinogenicity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ EPA is aware that some chronic effects result from acute(short-term) exposures and considers such data in the chronic toxicityevaluations. The Agency is further evaluating data on chronic effects resultingfrom acute exposures to ensure that such data receive adequate considerationin the RQ adjustment process. The Agency ranks hazardous substances for each intrinsic property (exceptpotential carcinogenicity) on a five-tier scale, associating a specificrange  of values on each scale with a particular RQ value.\5\<NOTE/> This five-tier scale uses the five RQ levels of one, 10,100, 1000, and 5000 pounds, originally established pursuant to CWA section311 (see 40 CFR 117 and 44 FR 50776). For hazardous substances evaluatedfor potential carcinogenicity, each substance is assigned a hazard rankingof ``high,'' ``medium,'' or ``low.'' These hazard rankings correspond toRQ levels of one, 10, and 100 pounds, respectively (see below). Each hazardoussubstance evaluated under the various primary criteria is assigned severaltentative RQ values based on its particular properties as data allow. Thelowest of the tentative RQs becomes the ``primary criteria RQ'' for thatsubstance. After the primary criteria RQs are assigned, substances arefurther evaluated for their susceptibility to certain degradative processes,which are used as secondary adjustment criteria. These natural degradativeprocesses are biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis (BHP). For furtherdiscussion of BHP, see Section II.B.2.a of the preamble to the final rulein which EPA promulgates RQ adjustments for 258 hazardous substances, publishedelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ All of the RQs promulgated in this rulemaking are subjectto the Agency's review of the most recent systemic (i.e., relating to aparticular organ system) toxicity data. These RQs will be revised, if necessary,in a future rulemaking based on the results of this review. If a hazardous substance, when released into the environment, degradesrelatively rapidly to a less hazardous form by one or more of the BHP processes,\6\<NOTE/> its RQ (as determined by the primary RQ adjustment criteria)is raised one level. This adjustment is made because the relative potentialfor harm to public health or welfare or the environment posed by the releaseof  such a substance is reduced by these degradative processes. Conversely,if a hazardous substance degrades to a more hazardous product after itsrelease, the original substance is assigned an RQ equal to the RQ for themore hazardous substance, which may be one or more levels lower than theRQ for the original substance. The downward adjustment is appropriate becausethe hazard posed by the release of the original substance is increasedas a result of BHP. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The specific thresholds for the application of BHP tohazardous substances are discussed in the Technical Background Documentto Support Rulemaking Pursuant to CERCLA Section 102, Volume 1, March 1985,available for inspection at Room M2427, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC 20460. To identify those CERCLA hazardous substances that may be potential carcinogens,EPA reviewed four sources of human epidemiologic and/or animal bioassaydata on hazardous substances that suggest possible carcinogenic effect.These sources are: (1) The Annual Reports on Carcinogens of the NationalToxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;(2) the Monographs of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC);(3) final Agency determinations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> identifying substances as potential carcinogens;and (4) ongoing determinations by the Agency's Office of Health and EnvironmentalAssessment that substances may be potential carcinogens, based on eitherpublished or unpublished data.\7\<NOTE/> The Agency compared the list of substances derived from thesefour sources with the list of the CERCLA hazardous substances to determinewhich hazardous substances should be evaluated for potential carcinogenicity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In addition to this application of unpublished data toidentify potential carcinogens, EPA intends to use such data for the purposeof ranking potential carcinogens under the CERCLA RQ methodology. Currently,the Agency is evaluating unpublished data received on the weight of evidenceand potency of certain potential carcinogens and will present the resultsof this evaluation, along with any RQ adjustments, in a future rulemaking.Not all of the substances so identified are subsequently ranked for potentialcarcinogenicity. Only those substances that fall within the  Agency's weight-of-evidenceGroups A, B, or C discussed below (i.e., known, probable, or possible humancarcinogens) are ranked and assigned tentative RQs based on potential carcinogenicity.The evaluation of hazardous substances for potential carcinogenicity initiallyinvolves a qualitative assessment of the available scientific literatureon the substance. The data are reviewed to determine the degree of certaintyor weight of evidence that a particular hazardous substance is a humancarcinogen. The substance is then classified in an overall weight-of- evidencecategory (A, B, C, D, or E). A hazardous substance is placed in Group A (known human carcinogen) onlyif ``sufficient'' evidence from human epidemiologic studies supports acausal connection between exposure to the hazardous substance and cancer.Group B (probable human carcinogen) is divided into two subgroups, B1 andB2. Group B1 includes hazardous substances for which the weight of evidenceof human carcinogenicity based on epidemiologic studies is ``limited.''Group B2 includes hazardous substances for which there is ``no data,''``inadequate evidence,'' or ``no evidence'' of human carcinogenicity fromepidemiologic studies, but for which the weight of evidence of carcinogenicitybased on animal studies is ``sufficient.'' Group C (possible human carcinogen)includes hazardous substances with ``limited'' evidence of carcinogenicityin animals and ``inadequate evidence,'' ``no data,'' or ``no evidence''from human epidemiologic studies. As mentioned in the March 16, 1987 NPRM(52 FR 8144), Group D substances (not classifiable for human carcinogenicity)and Group E substances (evidence of noncarcinogenicity for humans) arenot considered potential carcinogens for purposes of this rulemaking. The evaluation of hazardous substances for potential carcinogenicity alsoinvolves a quantitative assessment of the available data to calculate therelative strength of a hazardous substance to elicit a carcinogenic response(i.e., the ``potency factor'').\8\<NOTE/> This quantitative assessment allows the Agency to rank potentialcarcinogens on a numerical scale by identifying the most potent substancesas the most hazardous. Group 1 includes those hazardous substances withthe highest potencies. Other potential carcinogens with medium and lowpotencies are placed in Groups 2 and 3, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For an explanation of how potency factors are calculated,see the Technical Background Document to Support Rulemaking Pursuant toCERCLA Section 102, Volume 3, available for inspection at Room M2427, U.S.EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. The final step in the hazard ranking procedure is to combine the qualitativeweight-of-evidence groups and the quantitative potency factor groups usinga matrix to yield a relative hazard ranking for each substance. Thus, hazardrankings are based on two factors_weight of evidence and potency_that theAgency believes are important in describing carcinogenic hazards. The followingis the matrix used to assign hazard rankings to potential carcinogens intoday's two final rules: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1,i1,s10,r10,r10,r10 </C><T4>Hazard Ranking </T4><H1>Weight-of-evidence group </H1><H1>Potency group </H1><H2>1 (highest) </H2><H2>2 </H2><H2>3 (lowest)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">A <D>High </D><D>High </D><D>Medium. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B <D>High </D><D>Medium </D><D>Low. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C <D>Medium </D><D>Low </D><D>Low. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D <D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="27">No hazard ranking is made.

The other primary criteria are used toassign the RQ.</ITAG></ITAG>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The matrix is used to group the potential carcinogens into ``high,''``medium,'' and ``low'' hazard categories, and is arranged so that as theweight of evidence and the potency decrease, the hazard ranking also decreases.RQ levels are then assigned to the hazard rankings as follows: high_one-poundRQ; medium_10-pound RQ; and low_100-pound RQ. For a more detailed discussion of the RQ adjustment methodology based onthe primary criterion of potential carcinogenicity, see the preamble tothe March 16, 1987 NPRM (52 FR 8140) and the Technical Background Documentto Support Rulemaking Pursuant to CERCLA Section 102, Volume 3, availablefor inspection at Room M2427, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC 20460. EPA stated in the March 16, 1987 NPRM (see 52 FR 8146) that it was reviewingits position on consideration of benign tumors and pooling of tumor sitesand types, as set forth in the Agency's Guidelines for Carcinogen RiskAssessment.\9\<NOTE/> The effect of this review on RQs for potential carcinogensis discussed in the preamble to the final rule published elsewhere in today's<T4>Federal Register </T4>in which EPA promulgates RQ adjustments for 258hazardous substances.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ As discussed in Section II.B.2.c below, the Guidelinesprovide that benign tumors should be considered along with malignant tumorsunless there is evidence that the benign tumors do not have the potentialto progress to malignancies of the same histogenic origin. The Agency poolstumor sites and types when each site or type, viewed separately, showsa tumor incidence that is elevated significantly above the incidence incontrol animals (51 FR 33992, September 24, 1986).  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Responses to Comments Received on the Methodology </ITAG>The Agency received 35 comment letters on the March 16, 1987 NPRM (52 FR8140). Ten of these letters contain comments that address the RQ adjustmentmethodology proposed in that NPRM for evaluating CERCLA hazardous substancesfor potential carcinogenicity. The comments on the RQ adjustment methodologyare grouped into five categories: (1) Carcinogen hazard ranking methodology  and the 100-pound maximum RQ; (2) the use of NTP and IARC publicationsin the Agency's identification methodology; (3) the Agency's use of itsGuidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment to derive RQs; (4) the applicationof the secondary RQ adjustment criteria of BHP to potential carcinogens;and (5) the application of the CWA mixture rule to hazardous waste streams.Because none of the six hazardous substances that are the subject of thisfinal rule meets the criteria for applying BHP and none are hazardous wastestreams, the following discussion focuses on the first three comment categories.Comments that fall within the last two categories are addressed in a finalrule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>that promulgates RQ adjustments for 254 of the273 hazardous substances proposed for adjustment in the March 16, 1987NPRM. <T3>a. Carcinogen Hazard Ranking Methodology and the 100-Pound MaximumRQ. </T3>In the March 16, 1987 NPRM (52 FR 8140), EPA proposed RQ adjustmentsfor potential carcinogens of one, 10, and 100 pounds. Several commentersobjected to the proposed 100-pound maximum RQ for potential carcinogens.The commenters recommended that hazardous substances with no greater than``inadequate'' evidence of cancer in humans and ``limited'' evidence ofcancer in animals receive 1000- or 5000-pound RQs. EPA disagrees with the commenters for the reasons discussed below. First,as stated in the March 16, 1987 NPRM, although cancer is a unique healtheffect with its own special properties, it is also a type of chronic effect.EPA, therefore, has determined that reference to the Agency's chronic toxicitymethodology is appropriate in assigning RQs to potential carcinogens. Underthe chronic toxicity methodology, each substance is assigned two ratingvalues, one based on the dose that causes a particular effect, and onebased on the severity of the effect. The dose ratings range from one to10, with 10 representing the most toxic substances. The effect ratingsalso range from one to 10, with 10 representing the most severe effect.The product of the dose and effect ratings for each substance yields acomposite ranking score between one and 100. Because cancer is a life-threateningeffect, the effect rating for cancer would be 10 if cancer were rankedon the chronic toxicity scale. Therefore, the composite score for any potentialcarcinogen would be at least 10. A composite score of 10 corresponds toan RQ of 1000 pounds. Thus, a 5000-pound RQ for a potential carcinogenwould be inappropriate based on the Agency's chronic toxicity scale (see52 FR 8145). Two commenters stated that this analogy between chronic toxicity and potentialcarcinogenicity is not valid because chronic toxicants have <T3>known</T3> human health effects, whereas the human health effects ofpotential carcinogens are often determined by speculation based on animaldata. EPA believes that these commenters have exaggerated the distinctionbetween the data for chronic toxicity and the data for potential carcinogenicity.The human health effects of both chronic toxicants and potential carcinogensare based to a large degree on observation of health effects in experimentalanimals. Therefore, the Agency believes that reference to its chronic toxicitymethodology in determining the RQ levels for potential carcinogens is appropriate.Second, EPA believes that the special properties of potential carcinogensare important in assigning RQ levels to these substances. These specialproperties are: (1) The lack of a demonstrated threshold level below whicha potential carcinogen presents no risk of cancer; (2) the cumulative natureof cancer risks; and (3) the fact that cancer has a latent period thatdoes not allow direct observation of carcinogenic risks from substancesnewly released into the environment (52 FR 8145, March 16, 1987). These three special properties of potential carcinogens suggest a conservativeapproach by the Agency in assigning RQ levels to these substances. Wherea potential carcinogen does not have a threshold level of exposure belowwhich it presents no risk of cancer, each individual exposure, regardlessof amount, may cause irreversible health effects. The lack of demonstratedthreshold levels for potential carcinogens also means that an individualmay develop cancer (an irreversible health effect) at doses that causeno other physical effects. The cumulative nature of cancer risks meansthat each additional exposure, at any dose, further increases the likelihoodof a carcinogenic response. Additionally, for substances that have a latentperiod that does not allow direct observation of carcinogenic risks, theAgency has greater reason to be conservative in assessing the health risksaccompanying exposure at any dose. In particular, the latent period ofcancer, when taken together with the fact that cancer may develop fromdoses too small to cause other physical effects, means that individualsmay not be aware that they need to leave release sites at which they maybe exposed to dangerous levels of potential carcinogens. The Agency, therefore,has determined that the special properties of potential carcinogens justifyassigning lower RQs (i.e., one, 10, and 100 pounds) to potential carcinogensthan the RQs that are assigned to other hazardous substances (i.e., one,10, 100, 1000, and 5000 pounds). In summary, a 100-pound maximum RQ for potential carcinogens is retainedbecause (1) reference to the Agency's chronic toxicity scale shows thata 5000-pound RQ would be inappropriate for any potential carcinogen; and(2) the Agency believes that the special properties of potential carcinogensjustify a more conservative approach in setting RQ levels for these substancesthan for other hazardous substances.Several commenters objected to the fact that the Agency assigns the same``low'' hazard ranking (and resultant 100-pound RQ) to weight-of-evidenceGroup C, potency Group 3 potential carcinogens that it assigns to weight-of-evidenceGroup B2, potency Group 3 potential carcinogens. Thus, the commenters disagreedwith the proposed 100-pound maximum RQ for potential carcinogens. The commentersrecommended that hazardous substances with no greater than ``inadequate''evidence of cancer in humans and ``limited'' evidence of cancer in animals(i.e., weight-of-evidence Group C) receive 1000- or 5000-pound RQs.At this time, EPA has decided to retain the 100-pound maximum RQ for potentialcarcinogens. However, EPA plans to evaluate the RQ adjustment methodologyfor potential carcinogens, particularly the weight-of-evidence Group C,potency Group 3 substances.\1\\0\<NOTE/> The results of this evaluation will be addressed in a futureAgency action. Note that this continuing investigation does not alter today'sdetermination that these substances be assigned RQs of no more than 100pounds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Five individual hazardous substances are in this category:5-nitro-o-toluidine; saccharin; p-toluidine; 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane;and 1,1,2-trichloroethane. EPA is promulgating an RQ adjustment of 100pounds for saccharin in this final rule. RQ adjustments of 100 pounds forthe other four weight-of-evidence Group C, potency Group 3 substances arepromulgated in a final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In that same final rule, EPA also promulgatesRQ adjustments for seven waste streams (F002, K073, K095, K096, K112, K113,and K114) that contain one or more of the five weight-of-evidence GroupC, potency Group 3 substances.<T3>b. Use of NTP and IARC Determinations.</T3> Several commenters suggestedthat the Agency not rely on NTP and IARC determinations as a basis forRQ rulemakings and recommended that EPA independently evaluate the qualitativeevidence of carcinogenicity for each hazardous substance. In the March16, 1987 NPRM (52 FR 8143), the Agency proposed a procedure for screeningthe list of CERCLA hazardous substances to identify hazardous substancesthat might require assessment for potential carcinogenicity. The NTP annualreports and IARC monographs are used only as an initial screen for substancesto be evaluated for potential carcinogenicity by the Agency. The conclusionsreached by IARC or NTP on specific chemicals do not determine directlywhether a hazardous substance is considered a potential carcinogen forpurposes of establishing RQs. Rather, EPA follows the procedures set outin its Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment to make this determination.<T3>c. Application of EPA's Carcinogen Assessment Guidelines. </T3>EPA'smethodology for adjusting RQs for potential carcinogens is derived fromthe Agency's Guidelines on Carcinogen Risk Assessment. The comments addressedin this section are directed toward the Guidelines' classification of potentialcarcinogens. Although the discussion of these issues below is not an independentdefense of the Guidelines, the Agency's responses to public comments inthis rulemaking are fully consistent with EPA's response to comments receivedduring preparation of the final Guidelines.Two commenters objected to the Agency's lack of distinction between theB1 and B2 weight-of-evidence Groups for hazard ranking purposes. Thesecommenters suggested that weight-of-evidence Groups B1 and B2 be distinguishedby assigning B2 potential carcinogens hazard rankings one level higherthan the hazard rankings for B1 potential carcinogens.As discussed in Section II.B.1 above, the Agency has divided weight-of-evidenceGroup B into two subgroups, B1 and B2. Where there is limited evidenceof carcinogenicity from epidemiologic studies, a hazardous substance usuallyis placed in Group B1. Hazardous substances for which there is ``sufficient''evidence from animal studies and ``inadequate'' evidence or ``no data''from human epidemiologic studies are usually placed in Group B2. The decisionto divide Group B into two subgroups reflects only the type of evidenceof carcinogenicity, not a judgment that B2 substances are of lesser concernthan B1 substances. Furthermore, because it is reasonable to treat hazardoussubstances for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity inanimals (Group B2) as if they present a carcinogenic risk to humans, suchsubstances, along with other substances for which there is limited evidencefrom human epidemiologic studies (Group B1), are classified as probablehuman carcinogens (Group B). Thus, the Agency believes that, for RQ adjustmentpurposes, no distinction in levels of concern is warranted between GroupB1 and Group B2 substances.Two commenters suggested that the Agency not count benign tumors equallywith malignant tumors when there is no evidence that the benign tumorsare precursors of malignant tumors or are life threatening. EPA agreeswith the commenters that benign tumors should not be treated equally withmalignant tumors if there is no evidence that the benign tumors will progressto malignancies of the same histogenic origin. It is recognized, however,that benign tumors frequently induce malignant tumors and that benign tumorsoften progress to malignant tumors (see 51 FR 33992, 33994, citing InterdisciplinaryPanel on Carcinogenicity, 1984, Science 225:686, note 4). In such cases,the Agency's consideration of benign tumor data in assessing potentialcarcinogenicity is appropriate.Several commenters disagreed with the Agency's use of body surface arearatios for deriving human potency values from animal potency calculationsand recommended the use of body-weight ratios instead. The commenters arguedthat the use of body surface area as an interspecies scaling factor isbased on data relating to the noncarcinogenic effects of drugs. The Agency'suse of body surface area to extrapolate from animals to humans was discussedin the response to comments on the Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen RiskAssessment. In that response, the Agency concluded that the choice of thebody surface area scaling factor could be justified by the data on effectsof drugs in various species, and that EPA would continue to use this scalingfactor unless data on a specific agent suggests that a different scalingfactor is justified. Furthermore, because RQs are based on a relative rankingof substances, the consistent application of scaling factors to all substancesshould not have a material effect on the relative rankings.Two commenters objected to the Agency's policy of pooling tumors at differentsites. The Agency pools tumor sites, however, only when each site, viewedseparately, shows a significant elevated tumor incidence. EPA believesthat pooling of tumor sites is justified in these limited circumstancesbecause an agent that induces cancer in two locations is of greater concernthan an agent that induces cancer in only one location.The same two commenters objected to the Agency's use of effective dose(which takes into account absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretionof potential carcinogens) to calculate potency. The commenters argued thatadministered dose (the actual experimental dose) should be used to estimaterelative carcinogenic potency for purposes of assigning RQs. The commentersacknowledged that effective dose is appropriate for estimating absolutemeasures of risk. The commenters failed to demonstrate, however, that effectivedose is inappropriate for measuring relative risk. As a practical matter,for most hazardous substances (approximately 90 percent), EPA uses administereddose because the Agency lacks information necessary to distinguish betweenadministered dose and effective dose. Nevertheless, where such informationis available, the Agency prefers to use effective dose rather than administereddose, because the former is more appropriate for measuring relative levelsof risk (e.g., RQ levels). Effective dose is used to determine carcinogenicpotency only when a substance has undergone extensive studies that havebeen subject to peer review.One commenter stated that the Agency proposed to regulate animal carcinogensin the same manner as known human carcinogens and that regulation shouldfocus on exposures to substances with known human health effects. Thiscommenter is mistaken in believing that the RQ adjustment methodology treatsanimal and human carcinogens equally. The hazard ranking methodology usedto establish RQs for potential carcinogens assigns lower RQs to known humancarcinogens of the same potency as known animal carcinogens for which thehuman evidence is limited or inadequate. Moreover, EPA does not believethat its regulation of potential carcinogens should be limited to thosewhich have <T3>known</T3> human health effects, because the Agency strongly believesthat animal data are relevant to predict the potential for a carcinogenicresponse at some dose in humans.One commenter argued that extrapolation from continuous low-dose exposurestudies to effects of one-time releases cannot be made. The Agency acknowledgesthat estimating the absolute effect of one-time releases from experimentaldata is difficult. However, the establishment of RQs is not based on anassessment of absolute effects, and the Agency believes that the Guidelinesfor Carcinogen Risk Assessment (which were followed in this rulemaking)provide a reasonable basis for determining a relative ranking of potentialcarcinogens. These guidelines have been peer reviewed and revised basedon public comments and therefore provide a reasonable basis for carcinogenicassessment. Furthermore, the commenter failed to note certain implicationsof the relationship between one-time releases and one-time exposures. One-timereleases can contaminate water or soil, resulting in continuous low-doseexposures over a period of years. Thus, the Agency's extrapolation fromcontinuous low-dose exposure studies to effects of one-time releases isreasonable.This commenter also noted that there are significant uncertainties involvedin low-dose extrapolation. EPA agrees and, therefore, has developed anRQ methodology that does not use low-dose extrapolation. The methodologyrelies instead on the ED10, that is, the dose that causes an increasedcancer incidence of 10 percent. Use of the ED10 is advantageous becauseit eliminates the issue of low-dose extrapolation for RQ adjustment purposes.The same commenter argued that low doses of certain heavy metals are essentialto human health, and that low exposures to suspected carcinogens may notpose significant incremental risks. Thus, according to the commenter, extrapolationover a wide range of doses may not be appropriate.EPA agrees with the commenter that certain substances can have both beneficialeffects at low doses and toxic effects at high doses. In addition, lowdoses can have both beneficial and toxic effects simultaneously. The questionof whether a particular release will cause exposed individuals to experiencetoxic effects, however, is a question of risk assessment to be made bythe Federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) based on all available informationpertinent to the particular release. As stated earlier, the establishmentand adjustment of RQs is intended to be a reporting trigger rather thana risk assessment.For the reasons discussed above, EPA has decided at this time that no changesto the Agency's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment are necessary.Nevertheless, the Agency continually reviews the Guidelines; if new informationor procedures become available, the Agency will consider whether revisionsare warranted.C. Substances for Which RQs Are Adjusted<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary</ITAG>Today's final rule adjusts the RQs for six of the 273 hazardous substanceswhose RQs were proposed to be adjusted in the March 16, 1987 NPRM.

For the reasons discussed in Section I.B. of thispreamble, the Agency has decided to expedite the promulgation of RQ adjustmentsfor these six substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Response to Comments</ITAG>Public comments on the March 16, 1987 NPRM addressed proposed RQ adjustmentsfor three of the six hazardous substances in this rulemaking: 1,4-dioxane,saccharin, and perchloroethylene. No comments were received on the proposedRQ adjustments for 2-ethoxyethanol, ethylene oxide, and 2-nitropropane.Two commenters supported adjusting the RQ for 1,4-dioxane from the one-poundstatutory level to 100 pounds. One commenter supported the proposed RQadjustment of 100 pounds for saccharin because, the commenter suggested,the new reporting level would be consistent with public health concernsin general, and with the lack of hazard posed by a potential release ofbetween one and 100 pounds of saccharin during transportation. The Agencyagrees that the one-pound statutory RQ for saccharin does not appropriatelyreflect its carcinogenic potential. Saccharin is a weight-of-evidence GroupC, potency Group 3 substance which therefore receives a low hazard rankingand a 100-pound RQ.Three commenters recommended that perchloroethylene should be classifiedas a weight-of-evidence Group C substance, rather than as a Group B2 substanceas proposed in the March 16, 1987 NPRM. The available rat tumor data andmouse tumor data, when considered together, support the Agency's currentposition that perchloroethylene should fall into the B2 category basedon sufficient animal evidence of carcinogenicity (see Addendum to HealthAssessment Document for Tetrachloroethylene (Perchloroethylene), ExternalReview Draft, April 2, 1986; NTIS andplusmin;PB86-174489). EPA's positionon this issue is consistent with the IARC classification of perchloroethylene.However, it is important to note that EPA's B2 classification for perchloroethyleneis based on a draft carcinogenicity assessment that has not yet been finalized.If this classification changes based on the final assessment, and the changewarrants an adjustment of the RQ for perchloroethylene, the RQ will beadjusted in a future rulemaking. Pending the results of the Agency's finalcarcinogenicity assessment, the B2 classification and 100-pound RQ adjustmentfor perchloroethylene will be maintained in this final rule.In a final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Agency responds to public comments on 254of the 273 RQ adjustments proposed in the March 16, 1987 NPRM. As explainedin Section II.C.2.i of the preamble to that final rule, EPA will addressthe RQs for the remaining 13 substances that were the subject of the March16, 1987 NPRM in a future action.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. SUMMARY OF SUPPORTING ANALYSES</ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires that regulations be classified asmajor or nonmajor for purposes of review by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB). According to E.O. 12291, major rules are regulations thatare likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.An economic analysis performed by the Agency, available for inspectionat Room M2427, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, showsthat today's final rule is nonmajor, because the rule will result in estimatednet cost savings of $1.5 million annually. The annual net cost savingsof all RQ adjustments promulgated or proposed to date (including thosecontained in this final rule) is estimated to be $34.7 million. It shouldbe noted that these net cost savings reflect only those effects of theRQ adjustments that are: (1) Readily quantifiable in dollars; and (2) associatedwith the notification requirements under CERCLA section 103 and SARA section304 (including the associated activities of recordkeeping, notificationprocessing, monitoring, and response).This final rule has been submitted to OMB for review, as required by E.O.No. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have a ``significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.'' To determine whethera Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was necessary for today's final rule,a preliminary analysis was conducted using a computer model that simulatedthe typical operation of a small U.S. chemical company.The results of the simulation indicate that the upper-bound total costof compliance to small firms is negligible. See the Regulatory Impact Analysisof Reportable Quantity Adjustments Under Sections 102 and 103 of the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Volume I, March1985, available for inspection at Room M2427, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW.,Washington, DC 20460. Therefore, because today's final rule is not expectedto have a significant impact on small entities, EPA certifies that no RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis is necessary.C. Paperwork Reduction ActEPA requires an Information Impact Analysis for all rules that impose apaperwork burden on the public. This analysis estimates the burden imposedon parties outside EPA for activities such as notification or recordkeeping.Today's final rule will provide a decrease in the paperwork burden imposedon the regulated community for information collection associated with fewerreleases being reportable. Because the effect of this final rule on thepaperwork burden is a reduction, EPA has determined that no further InformationImpact Analysis need be performed.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act,44 U.S.C. Section 3501 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and have been assigned OMB control number 2050-0046.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 8 to 11 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 302</ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Hazardous materialstransportation, Hazardous substances, Hazardous wastes, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Pesticides and pests, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal,Water pollution control, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
