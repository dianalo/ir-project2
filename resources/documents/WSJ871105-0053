Bevins Jr., vice president and chief financial officer, who is resigning at the end of the year.    The broadcasting concern said Paul D. Beckham, vice president for administration, will become senior vice president for finance and administration. Randy L. Booth, director of special projects, was named vice president for finance. The assignments will take effect upon Mr. Bevin's departure, Turner said. Mr. Bevins, 41 years old, will remain a Turner director, the company added.    Mr. Beckham, 44, will be responsible for all non-operating divisions of the company, including financial, legal, human resources, real estate operations and risk management, Turner said. He will also join Turner's executive committee. Mr. Booth, 35, will assume primary responsibility for external financings, mergers and acquisitions, the company said.    Neither man assumes the title of chief financial officer, a company spokesman said. He wouldn't elaborate. It wasn't clear whether the title of chief financial officer would be discontinued after Mr. Bevins leaves.    Mr. Bevins's resignation raised questions about the company's ability to complete a planned restructuring of $1.4 billion in debt. The restructuring has been stalled because of the volatility in the stock market, company officials said.    Although Mr. Bevins was the company's point man on financial matters, Mr. Beckham is not unfamiliar to the financial community, according to analysts and company officials. He joined Turner in 1971 as corporate controller and, as the company's chief accounting officer, he has been the source for details on the finances of the company's operating units, analysts and Turner officials said.    As director of special projects, Mr. Booth helped restructure the operations of MGM and negotiate the sale of studio properties and the film lab operations. Turner acquired MGM/UA Entertainment Co. in 1986 and sold off nearly all of the company except for its film library.    The appointments followed Turner Broadcasting's announcement Tuesday that it realigned the responsibilities of some top executives. Gerald F. Hogan, former vice president for advertising sales, emerged with a much more influential role -- apparently at the expense of Robert J. Wussler, the company's executive vice president since 1980, and Mr. Bevins. Some former Turner officials say Mr. Bevins saw himself as the successor to Turner Broadcasting Chairman Ted Turner.    Mr. Hogan was named president of the company's Entertainment Network, which includes overall responsibility for the WTBS station, which is carried on cable television systems across the country. Mr. Wussler was named senior executive vice president with some programming and other responsibilities, but relinquished the presidency of WTBS.    Separately, the company's Cable News Network is said to be developing a pilot for a Spanish-language version of its 24-hour Headline News service. A CNN spokeswoman said the company isn't ready to discuss the project.    According to television industry officials, the initial client for the service would be New York-based Telemundo Group Inc., a Spanish-language television network. A Telemundo spokewoman said that the company is aware of the CNN project, but that it would be premature to discuss its possible role. </TEXT></DOC>
