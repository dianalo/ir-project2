Roberts' underground comics feature the superheroes Blindman, Mr.Wheels, Deaf Girl and The Human Crutch _ the Infirmity 4.   Armored wheelchairs, a flame-spewing crutch and a seeing-eyehound burst from the pages of ``Anti-Social for the Disabled.''   In addition to the superheroes, the 29-year-old Roberts presentsinappropriate jokes: ``Why don't blind people skydive? It scareshell out of their dog.''   And there's ``Freaky Franky,'' a paralyzed Franklin Roosevelt,who out of embarrassment refuses to use a wheelchair and orders theSecret Service to prop him up and propel him from behind.   Roberts, who was stricken with muscular dystrophy when he was 15,remembers his first night out in a wheelchair.   ``I rolled into an Oak Park restaurant. I felt every eye on me.What else could I do? I started laughing.''   This seems to describe the Muse at his ear when, in 1982, hebegan publishing a series of underground comics named ``Anti-Social,a Helpless Anger Production.''   The seventh and latest in the series is ``Anti-Social for theDisabled,'' co-authored by two disabled friends, Mike Ervin and SueNussbaum.   As his muscles deteriorate, Roberts has lost his ability to takecare of himself well enough to live alone. Eventually, he'll needhelp to eat, use the bathroom and to breathe.   The disintegration of his own life is reflected in the comics.   ``Sure, it's raw and outrageous,'' said Terry Hamilton, anemployee of Barbara's Bookstore, where Roberts' publications aresold. ``But our clients are theater people, new wavers, punkers,Near North Side yuppies _ and that's who likes adult comics. Theydeal with serious matters through outrageous drawings and shock.''   Marca Bristow of Access Living, a support organization for adultdisabled, said, ``it finds ways to laugh at things we'd otherwisecry about.''   The 1,000 copies of ``Anti-Social for the Disabled'' that wereprinted have been sold, and Roberts says 200 more will be run off.   Meanwhile, comic No. 8 in the series is under way _ a sequel to``Anti-Social for the Disabled.''   And there we'll see Mr. Wheels unable to get up a curb to rescuea citizen screaming for help.   But Deaf Girl, using a sonar beam, blasts the curb into a gravelramp and ...   Stay tuned.</TEXT></DOC>
