A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors. It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance. Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets.    The case was disclosed in an article in the French magazine L'Express on the activities of a company called Accessoires Scientifiques, which is owned by the French bank Societe Generale through another subsidiary, Sogexport. A U.S. Defense Department official said she believes the L'Express report is broadly true. French officials couldn't be reached for comment.    The U.S. Commerce Department said it banned the Societe Generale unit last year from handling any U.S. exports to any destination. That step came after the company was charged by Luxembourg customs authorities with trying to export machinery without proper licenses. U.S. officials said some of the sensitive equipment involved was U.S.-made.    A Societe Generale spokesman said all the unit's exports had the necessary French government approval. The bank also said it regrets last year's &quot;sudden U.S. administrative action&quot; and that it has filed an appeal.    The case came to light after an apparently unrelated allegation that a now-defunct French company, Ratier-Forest S.A., defied a Western export ban and sent sensitive machine tools to a Soviet submarine yard in the 1970s. Japan's Toshiba Corp., which has admitted exporting even more advanced machine tools to the Soviets, says it did so only after it learned that a French concern already was breaking the export ban.    These cases also are important because of a behind-the-scenes dispute between hard-liners in the U.S. Defense Department who want to tighten the export controls and technology companies in the U.S. and elsewhere that want to expand their exports.    If the new allegations are true, they will support claims that violations of export bans have been widespread in Western Europe and that controls need to be strengthened. The new allegations also could bolster Japan's position that it shouldn't be singled out for punishment because of the Toshiba case.    Western export controls are established through a Paris-based international agency, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom.    According to L'Express, the Societe Generale unit shipped the high-technology equipment to the Soviet Union regularly on Air France cargo flights until May 1985, when a cancellation of an Air France flight forced it to send a shipment through Luxembourg.    Customs authorities there seized the machine, made by Veeco Instruments Inc. of the U.S. A court case charging the French company with exporting without a license currently is under way in Luxembourg. News reports there say arguments in the case could be completed as early as tomorrow.    Even if the Luxembourg court confirms the charge, however, the company could continue with its exports. Societe Generale doesn't acknowledge that its unit did anything improper, and officials of the unit have been quoted as saying that if they no longer can export U.S.-made equipment, they will buy similar machines in Britain. </TEXT></DOC>
