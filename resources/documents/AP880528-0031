The only offices the Ministry of Supervision will not be allowedto invade are those of the Defense Ministry and the StateCommission for Restructuring the Economy, the Xinhua News Agencysaid.   The Defense Ministry presumably was excluded for reasons ofsecurity, but the report did not say why the economic commissionwas exempted.   The Ministry of Supervision was set up in December 1986 with amandate to sniff out cases of corruption and excessivebureaucratism at all levels of government.   It has a total of 15,000 employees with offices in most ofChina's cities and counties, Xinhua said.   Nonetheless, cases of corruption have continued to climb, andthis week's Outlook Weekly magazine announced the Communist Partywas launching a new ``full-scale fight'' against corruption in itsranks.   It said the campaign would be long-term and wrongdoers would bepunished, but did not give specifics.   Cases of corruption appear frequently in the official press, onall scales. Earlier this year, the People's Daily reported that $52million allocated by the government for aiding povertry-strickenareas was misspent by local officials on such things as taperecorders and cars.   Cases of local officials eating and drinking extravagantly onthe government tab and party leaders pocketing party dues also havebeen reported in recent weeks.   Corruption has burgeoned in part because opportunities havegrown. Under senior leader Deng Xiaoping's 10-year-old program torevitalize the economy, lower-level governments and state-ownedfactories have been given greater autonomy in financial matters.   At the same time, China's general rise in prosperity has raisedthe revenues of these governments and factories, increasing thetemptation to would-be embezzlers.</TEXT></DOC>
