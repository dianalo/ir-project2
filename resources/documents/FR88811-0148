The scheduled 3-day closure wasdeveloped in anticipation of a high-effort fishery; it would have providedtime for the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Salmon Technical Teamto assess landings and determine if enough fish remained in the quota towarrant additional fishing. However, because commercial fishing effortbetween Cape Falcon and the Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, is being assessedin a timely fashion and is currently lower than preseason predictions,the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determinedthat a closure to assess data is unnecessary and would unjustifiably disruptthe commercial salmon fishing season in the area. This action is intendedto maximize the harvest of coho salmon in this area without exceeding theocean share of coho salmon allocated to the commercial fishery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Rescission of the required 3-day closure to oceancommercial salmon fishing in the EEZ in the area which remains open betweenCape Falcon, Oregon, and Horse Mountain California, upon the projectedattainment of 85 percent of the coho salmon quota for the area south ofCape Falcon is effective on August 8, 1988.

Management measures for 1988were effective on May 1, 1988 (53 FR 16002, May 4, 1988). The 1988 commercialfishery from Cape Falcon, Oregon, to Horse Mountain, California, is requiredby the 1988 regulations to close for 3 days to allow assessment of landingsand projection of the remaining all-species fishing period when the SalmonTechnical Team estimates that 85 percent of the coho salmon quota for thearea south of Cape Falcon has been reached (53 FR 16007). Currently, onlythe area from Cape Falcon to the Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, is opento commercial salmon fishing. The area between Humbug Mountain, Oregon,and Punta Gorda, California, closed on June 7, 1988 (53 FR 22000, June13, 1988). It was anticipated preseason that harvest in the commercial fishery inthe affected area would occur rapidly with high fishing effort, thus necessitatinga 3-day closed period when 85 percent of the coho salmon quota was reachedto allow assessment of landing data and projection of the amount of fishingtime remaining. However, commercial fishing effort between Cape Falconand Orford Reef Red Buoy is currently lower than preseason predictions,and landing data are being assessed in a timely manner. Therefore, thescheduled 3-day closure is no longer necessary to bring data up to date.Consequently, NOAA issues this notice to rescind the scheduled 3-day closureof the EEZ in that area which remains open between Cape Falcon, Oregon,and Horse Mountain, California, to ocean commercial salmon fishing uponthe projected attainment of 85 percent of the coho salmon quota for thetotal area south of Cape Falcon. This notice is effective [insert dateof filing for public inspection with the Office of the Federal Register].This notice does not apply to other fisheries which may be operating inother areas. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and theCalifornia Department of Fish and Game regarding the rescission of therequired 3-day closure of the commercial fishery between Cape Falcon andthe Orford Reef Red Buoy. The State of Oregon also will rescind the 3-dayclosure of the commercial fishery in state waters adjacent to this areaof the EEZ in accordance with this Federal action. Because of the need for immediate action to prevent unnecessary closureof the fishery, the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good causeexists for this notice to be issued without affording a prior opportunityfor public comment. Therefore, public comments on this notice will be acceptedfor 15 days after the effective date, through August 23, 1988. Federal regulations at 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(i) authorize the modificationof fishing seasons if certain findings are made as described in the appendixto 50 CFR Part 661, section III.B. Accordingly, the Regional Director hasdetermined this inseason adjustment is consistent with fishery regimesestablished by the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, ocean escapementgoals, conservation of the salmon resource, any adjudicated fishing rights,and the ocean allocation scheme in the Fishery Management Plan for OceanSalmon Fisheries off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.This inseason adjustment is based on consideration of the total allowableimpact limitation for coho salmon south of Cape Falcon, Oregon, the amountof commercial and recreational catch of coho salmon in the area to date,and the amount of commercial fishing effort in the area to date. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Matters</ITAG>This section is authorized by 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(i) and is in compliancewith E.O. 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801<T3> et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
