Data on p.z.c.for single oxides obtained by using various techniques abound in theliterature; however, relatively few data for mixed/multiple oxides areavailable. In this preliminary report p.z.c. data on TiO/sub 2/-ZrO/sub2/ powders calcined at 500deg and 1000degC, obtained by the potentiometricmethod, are presented and the results are briefly discussed.
