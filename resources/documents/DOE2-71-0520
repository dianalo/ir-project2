The basic selenophene ring is retained within the polylmericstructure. The IR bands of the doped material are broadened and shiftedto lower frequencies with respect to those of the undoped polymer. Virbroniccoupling of delocalized positive changes in the oxidized polymer withthe skeletal stretching vibrations of the backbone accounts for thiseffect. From the UV-visible absorption spectra, the authors calculateda band-gap of 2.0 eV for the undoped state. In the doped state, the absorptionextends into the IR region and its characteristic of free-carriers. Thesurface morphology depends on the thickness of the film. Thin films appearhomogeneous, whereas thick films exhibit irregularities. With increasingfilm thickness the rate of cross linking also increases. The asymmetryof the cone-level spectra of the carbon C (ls) indicates structural disorder.The spectra also suggest the removal of electron density from seleniumduring the oxidation of the polymer.</TEXT></DOC>
