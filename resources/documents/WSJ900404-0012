WHO statistician Alan Lopez and Richard Peto, an epidemicsexpert at Britain's Oxford University, said their studyindicated smoking would be the No. 1 cause of death in theworld by the turn of the century. &quot;Today there will be 8,000deaths a day from smoking, but when the kids reach middle agethere will be something like 28,000 deaths a day,&quot; Mr. Petotold the conference.   If present patterns continued, 200 million people underthe age of 20 and 300 million adults will die of smoking by2015, Mr. Peto said, adding: &quot;These figures are at the lowend of estimates.&quot;   Two-thirds of the forecast deaths in the 1990s will occurin wealthy nations, the study said, but developing nationswill probably experience 70% of all world deaths from smokingby 2025.

Heconceded that Eastern Europe has great political leverage foraid because of the West's need to consolidate the East'sshift away from the Communist bloc. However, he said, &quot;We aremore ready to talk of free-enterprise than Eastern Europe. Toadjust our mentality to the free market will be easier.&quot;                                                                                                          VENDING-MACHINE BEEF                                                                                                          A joint venture between Japanese and U.S. meat dealerswill sell beef imported from the U.S. in freezer-equippedvending machines. &quot;Our aim is to supply imported beef at acheaper price to consumers by reducing the costs ofdistribution-related personnel,&quot; said Naoki Sakai, aspokesman for Japan's Jackson Co.

Under the venture,seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be processed in theU.S. before being imported in frozen vacuum packages for salein 1,000 vending machines throughout Japan.

THE SCOURGE OF RWANDA                                                                                                          Up to 30% of Rwandans living in the capital city of Kigaliand aged between 18 and 45 are infected with the virus thatcauses AIDS, according to one of the country's leadingdoctors.   Henri Taelman, the head of medical services at Kigali'smain hospital, said in a report that the total number ofinfected people in the central African country had almostdoubled in four years. The report said 25% to 30% of thesexually active population of Kigali, where 157,000 peoplelive, carry the AIDS virus. This compares with 18% in 1986.   In the countryside, where most of Rwanda's six millionpeople live, the rate was between 2% and 3% but increasing.   Dr. Taelman said the capital's main hospital treated morethan 4,600 AIDS patients last year -- half of all itspatients. He said drugs to treat AIDS were too expensive forRwanda and that the hospital could only try to ease thesuffering of AIDS patients before they died.

Two farmers from the Chinese province of Sichuan wereexecuted for selling the skins of giant pandas, China's LegalDaily reported.
