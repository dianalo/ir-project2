Withthe following four macros, this chilling experience need never happen again.andO;Here are instructions for a macro that creates a header, another thatproduces a bordered title page, a macro that marks table of contents entries,and one that formats and generates the table of contents.andP;  Header macroandM;First, create a macro that inserts a header containing your name, theinstructor's name, course and current date.andP;  The macro pauses while you typethe name of the instructor and the course-which lets you use the macro forany class.andP;  To create this header macro, clear the screen and press MacroDefine (Ctrl-F10), type header and press (Enter).andP;  Type a description, suchas Header macro, and press (Enter), Format  (Shift-F8), (2) Page.andP;  Next,press (3) Headers, (1) Header A, (2) Every Page.andP;  The header edit screenappears.andM;To be sure the header prints in a particular font, press Font  (Ctrl-f8), (4)Base Font, (N) Name Search,  W the name of the desired font, press (Enter)and (1) Select.andP;  Without this step, the header will print in the fontselected in Format  (Shift-F8), (3) Document, (3) Initial Font.andP;  Now pressFlush Right (Alt-F6), type your name and press (Enter).andP;  Again, press FlushRight  (Alt-F6), then place a pause in the macro by pressing  (Ctrl-pgup),(1) Pause and (Enter).andP;  Press (Enter) to move to the next line, then pressFlush Right (Alt-F6).andM;This time, press Date/outline (Shift-F5), (1) Date Text so the current dateis inserted when you use the macro.andP;  Press (Enter).andP;  Now add page numberingby pressing Flush Right (Alt-F6), typing Page, pressing (Space Bar), then  'B(Ctrl-b)-this code inserts the current page number at its position.andP;  Note.andO;In 5.andP;  1, instead of repeatedly pressing Flush Right  (Alt-F6), you could setright justification at the top of the header by pressing Format (Shift-F8),(1) line, (3) Justification, (3) Right.andP;  That way, all the entries in theheader are automatically flush right.andP;  Now, press Exit  F7) twice to returnto the document screen, then press Macro Define  (Ctrl-FlO) to end the macro.andO;Keep in mind that the macro creates a header, so it's only visible in Print (Shift-F7), (6) View Document.andM;Now, when you have a school paper to type, press Macro  (Alt-F10), typeheader and press (Enter).andP;  Good grades have never been so easy.andP;  Note: Theprogram inserts a blank line between the last line of the header and firstline of text.andM;If you put hard returns after the text in the header, there will be extraspace between the header and the document.andP;  Also, headers and footers reducethe number of text lines on a page according to the number of lines in theheader or footer.andP;  Title page macroandM;You can really get fancy with your title page.andP;  For example, put a thickborder around the outside with a graphics figure box, then use a large fontfor the title and a smaller one for your name.andP;  Sometimes you can even bringin a graphic, if it fits with the theme of the paper.andP;
