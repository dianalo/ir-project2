The authors specify the following methods: (1) structural- decreasing the dimensions of the active regions should further increasethe limiting frequencies, decrease the noise factor, and increase thegain; (2) choice of semiconducting material - the use of semiconductorswith higher charge-carrier mobility will improve the limiting frequencies,gain, and noise factor and affect the choice of structure of the semiconductingdevice.</TEXT></DOC>
