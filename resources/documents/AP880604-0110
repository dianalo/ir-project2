Kochsaid of the incident, which occurred about 4:20 p.m. Friday on WNYC.``They don't allow this kind of nudity for adults. They would notintentionally put this show on a children's hour.''   ``They say a producer fell asleep at a switch,'' Koch saidSaturday. ``The producer is supposed to screen them.''   The New York Post reported the incident in its Saturday editions.   Koch said it wasn't known how the clip got into the pre-recordedprogram, which was ``provided by the video industry.''   ``There's no liability here. It's a mistake. We're not going tohang anybody,'' said Koch. ``The producer who works for WNYC isultimately responsible.''   Asked if the unidentified producer would be disciplined, Kochreplied, ``He'll be told, `Stop sleeping.'''   The program, ``Video Music Box,'' reaches hundreds of thousandsof youngsters each weekday afternoon.   WNYC gets 30 percent of its funds from the city and 70 percentfrom the WNYC Foundation, a non-profit group partly appointed by thecity.</TEXT></DOC>
