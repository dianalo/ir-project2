The exchange's board of governors approved a five-fold increase in the maximum fine for a member found guilty of &quot;major&quot; offenses. The maxmium penalty was raised to $250,000 from $50,000.    The board also approved forcing a member to pay back to the exchange any profits received from the abuses that precipitated the fine.    A trader commits a major offense at the Merc by making pre-arranged trades with another broker without offering them to the rest of the traders in a pit and by trading ahead of a customer's order, among other violations.    The success of the Merc's financial futures and futures options &quot;demands that we maintain tough and efficient surveillance procedures coupled with strong sanction rules,&quot; said Leo Melamed, chairman of the exchange's executive committee and special counsel.    For lesser infractions the Merc increased the maximum penalty to $25,000 from $5,000.    In the past, the exchange has fined members more than the $50,000 limit when traders consented to Merc penalties without admitting or denying the exchange's findings on which the penalties were based. Last week, for example, the Merc fined four traders -- three of whom were from the same family -- a total of $325,000 for allegedly making pre-arranged stock-index futures trades.    A futures industry lawyer noted that the exchange's arbitration committee already could require brokers to reimburse customers who suffered a loss as a result of trading abuses. The latest rule change appears to broaden that option and give the exchange the ability to force a member to disgorge profits &quot;without there having to be a victim,&quot; the lawyer said.    The exchange said it also planned to post four compliance department employees on the trading floor at all times during the trading day to better monitor trading practices.    The Merc's Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit has been the focus of the exchange's attempt to crack down on trading abuses, following widespread complaints from customers and member traders earlier this year.    The exchange said it plans to enlarge the Sandamp;P 500 pit slightly to make it easier to gauge compliance with its rules.    It also said that, following the expiration of the June Sandamp;P 500 futures contract June 19, it will implement previously announced rule changes aimed at curbing abuses.    As previously reported, the Merc plans to prohibit traders from trading for their own accounts if they fill customer orders from the top step of the Sandamp;P 500 pit, where customer orders enter the trading arena. Among other rule changes, the Merc will require brokers trading for both their own and customer accounts to manually record the time of their personal trades to the nearest minute. </TEXT></DOC>
