It was an outright lie that has caused deep consternationin Moscow. Speaking to Soviet military officers last week,Mr. Gorbachev sharply denounced Saddam Hussein's &quot;betrayal oftrust&quot; -- a charge frequently repeated by Soviet officialsand the media in their condemnation of the Iraqi attack.</LP><TEXT>   The feeling of being grossly deceived by one of itsforemost Middle East allies has played an important role inshaping Moscow's reaction to the crisis, particularly itssanctioning of military force to implement the economicembargo against Iraq. At the same time, Arab and Westerndiplomats here say that Soviet indignation is tempered by astrong desire to forge new alliances in the Middle Eastwithout abandoning old friends.   Thus, as the U.S. uses its military muscle in an attemptto drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, the Soviets haveadopted a more cautious, even-handed position.   While happy to be cooperating with the U.S. in thispost-Cold War conflict, Moscow is also eager to be viewed inthe Middle East as an independent player. Rather than turningits back on diplomacy, it is strongly encouraging efforts tofind a political solution to the crisis. And all the while,it is looking to use the Iraqi invasion to boost itsinfluence in the Arab world.   &quot;In a sense, they are trying to have good relations witheveryone,&quot; says one Arab ambassador in Moscow. &quot;They'rekeeping the door open.&quot;   Given such a policy, the Soviets are deeply reluctant tobecome involved militarily in the Persian Gulf. ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze has said Moscow doesn't plan onsending forces to implement the embargo. But he didn't ruleout joining a multilateral military force if the UnitedNations agreed to dispatch one.   Some Westerners believe Moscow is so angry with SaddamHussein that it could be nudged into taking such action.After meeting Messrs. Gorbachev and Shevardnadze over theweekend, France's Foreign Minister Roland Dumas describedSoviet policy as one of taking &quot;a few steps at a time.&quot; Whilethe Soviet president wants a peaceful settlement through firmexecution of U.N. resolutions and good coordination with Arabnations, &quot;he didn't rule out measures of coercion againstIraq,&quot; Mr. Dumas told reporters.   The Iraqi invasion came at a critical time for Sovietpolicy makers. For months, Moscow has made strenuous effortsto improve its ties with moderate Arab nations such as Egyptand Saudi Arabia. At the same time, it has been treating itstraditional, radical allies in the region -- Iraq, Libya,Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization -- morecoolly.   The latest Gulf crisis has brought this nascent policyshift clearly into the open, and seems likely to give it abig impetus. In the past few days, Moscow has hosted theEgyptian foreign minister and a special envoy of SaudiArabia, with whom the Soviets don't have diplomaticrelations. The Saudi visit came only weeks after Moscow forthe first time allowed Soviet Moslem pilgrims to travel tothe holy city of Mecca.   Moreover, following the Iraqi invasion, the Soviet mediahave resounded with strong criticism of past Kremlin policyin the Middle East, particularly the practice of armingunreliable dictators.   &quot;Didn't we bind our hands by declaring `friendship andcooperation'? Haven't we been too unscrupulous in the choiceof our friends?&quot; asked Alexander Bovin, a foreign-policycommentator in the government daily Izvestia last week. &quot;Ingeneral it would be sensible to review the list of countriesand people with whom the U.S.S.R. maintains privilegedrelations.&quot;   Mr. Bovin said the Soviet leadership has long hadmisgivings about Iraq's Mr. Hussein, particularly regardingthe rationale for his war with Iran. Nonetheless it continuedto provide Baghdad with huge amounts of military hardware.Thanks to glasnost, or the policy of openness, the Sovietshave for the first time given the public -- and the Pentagon-- a list of the weapons supplied.   According to a senior military official, Lt. Gen. VladimirNikityuk, they include T-72 tanks, infantry fightingvehicles, self-propelled 122mm and 152mm howitzers,anti-aircraft missile systems, MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighterplanes, helicopters and equipment such as gas masks andprotective suits for use in chemical warfare. All this wasprovided to the Iraqis under a 1972 treaty of friendship andcooperation between the two nations.   With the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, these weapons weighheavily on the Soviet conscience. In explaining his supportfor the U.N.-backed embargo, Mr. Gorbachev said that &quot;itwould be unacceptable for us to react in any other waybecause this aggression has been committed with the use ofarms that we agreed to sell to Iraq solely for the purposesof defense, and not for the seizure of others' territory orof entire countries.&quot;   Arab diplomats in Moscow say the Soviet leader's evidentembarrassment is likely to have an impact on Moscow'srelations with Libya, and possibly the Palestine LiberationOrganization. &quot;Under perestroika, the Soviets don't want Arabradicals jeopardizing their relations with the U.S.,&quot; saysone senior Arab official. &quot;They're looking at theirtraditional allies and asking what the support gets themapart from a bad reputation.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev is certainly acting as a man with agrievance. Last Friday he gave Saddam Hussein just 90 minutesto respond to a message ordering Iraq to respect U.N.resolutions and pull out of Kuwait. When no reply came, theSoviets voted in the U.N. Security Council to enforce theembargo with military means.   Yet at the same time, Moscow seems unwilling to sever theties to Iraq and other allies. Mr. Shevardnadze gave Iraq'sdeputy prime minister a careful hearing when he visited theSoviet Union, though officials subsequently denied that therehad been a change of Soviet position. And even Mr. Gorbachevis careful to say that his wrath is aimed at Saddam Hussein,and not the Iraqi people.   &quot;My colleagues and I are concerned that it is moredifficult to build a relationship with a country than to tryto break it up,&quot; Col. Valentin Ogurtsov, a senior DefenseMinistry official, told reporters. &quot;It isn't easy for us tomove from full-fledged relations to zero.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
