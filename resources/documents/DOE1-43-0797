<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0797 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using computerized cost models developed both internally and under contractto EPA by the Tennessee Valley Authority over a period of several years,this paper presents costs for utility retrofit applications of wet fluegas desulfurization (FGD), dry FGD, and the limestone injection withmultistage burner (LIMB) process. Capabilities of the models, premises,and limits of the sensitivity study are discussed. Tabular and graphicalpresentations of the results are included. For a base case of 300 MWeboiler size, 2.2% sulfur coal, 50% capacity factor, intermediate sorbentcost ($71/ton lime and $15/ton limestone), 1.6 retrofit factor for FGDsystems, and 15 year remaining unit life, the unit control costs forwet FGD, dry FGD, and LIMB are 1337, 1120, and 997 $/ton of SO{sub 2}removed, respectively. Sensitivity of costs to each of the above parametersspanning the base case is presented and discussed. Unit control costsare developed for all cases, while capital costs and levelized annualrevenue requirements are also presented for the base case. 7 references,6 figures, 5 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
