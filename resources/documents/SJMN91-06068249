(Color)  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; ENTERTAINMENT; PARK  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  IF YOU met Claude Mabillard at a dinner party, you'd never guess that thesoft-spoken, impeccably polite Swiss gentleman makes his living creatinginstruments of mass terror.;    But here he was -- at Great America in SantaClara, on a recent dank and rainy day -- pacing a freshly poured concreteplatform, surveying his sinister handiwork and waiting anxiously for the firstscreams to start.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TWIST andamp; SHOUTIT'S STAND-UP, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NO JOKE.IT'S GREAT AMERICA'S DIZZYING VORTEX,THE ONLYSTAND-UP ROLLER COASTER WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.SOUND A LITTLE SCARY?COME ALONG WITH US.  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;In all my work, the greatest satisfaction is to hear the cry of a loadedtrain -- the first one is always special -- you know?&quot; said Mabillard,allowing himself a modest hint of a smile. &quot;Am I a sadist? No no no . . .&quot;;   Sadist or not, his latest creation, the Vortex, will be responsible for moresweaty palms and heart palpitations than the entire Internal Revenue Servicecorps of auditors. The $5.5 million ride, a towering mass of coiled steellurking in the back of the amusement park like a great lime-green serpent, isno ordinary, run-of-the-mill Vomit Comet. Besides being the biggest singleexpenditure in the park's 15-year history, the coaster, which debuts Saturday,is also the only stand-up coaster west of the Mississippi.;    Climb aboardfor a little sneak preview with the very first set of Vortex victims:;    Youstand, four abreast, in a 28-passenger sled attached to a pair of tubularrails by what appears to be nothing more than a flimsy set of over-sizedtraining wheels. You straddle a plastic bicycle seat, and pull the U-shapedbar down over your shoulders. The padded bar's steel handles are armpit high,and when you grip them you feel like Buck Rogers with a new jet pack. Anattendant reaches over and checks with a tug to make sure your U-bar islocked. Stand up straight and pay attention. This is serious. Without thatbar, you'd be flung out into the great, gray Silicon Valley sky like a walnutout of a slingshot.;    That helpless feeling;  From the control booth, theP.A. buzzes: &quot;Clear one. Clear two. DISPATCH!&quot; The sled pulls around the firsttight U-turn and into a long climb. As you trundle off to meet your destiny,you look helplessly at your loved ones standing on the platform and noticethey are smiling at you with the most peculiar grins. You wonder if perhapsthey know something you don't.;    During the agonizing 91-foot climb, youthink how peaceful all those widget factories look from the air, how theclouds seem to just kiss the edges of Milpitas and Alviso, how . . . there isno track. There is no track!;    In front, where the track should be, there'sjust air. You're jerked violently to the left; your feet are knocked out fromunder you and it all ends in a whoosh. From there you're just like a thumbtackbeing sucked through the world's longest, most powerful vacuum-cleaner hose.;   The sled whips through a 360-degree vertical loop and gets threaded througha corkscrew like a kite being towed by a speeding car. At the bottom of thecorkscrew, your body achieves a maximum acceleration of 4.5 G's: 4 1/2 timesthe force of gravity.;    At this point, a 165-pound man would effectivelyweigh 742 pounds. Or the equivalent of more than three full-blown ElvisPresleys -- an E-force of 3.22. The relentless centrifuge effect sends a rushof blood coursing through your head with unnatural force. At least the topguns who fly F-16 fighters get to sit down in a nice secure cockpit whilerocketing through the stratosphere. This experience is much more like beingstrapped spread-eagle to the bottom of an F-16.;    No mercy;  One minute intothe ride, you're a basket case -- a crying, whimpering lump of soft fleshbeing popped through your harness into the blurry abyss. Face it -- you'reshot, yet there is no mercy, no pause, no chance to figure out which way isup. One moment you think you're falling and yet there's pressure on your backslamming you through yet another loop. The next moment, you think you'reclimbing, and yet there's an unseen weight like the ghost of some lowlandgorilla standing on your chest.;    It's hard to count when your head and yourtorso are going in two separate directions at 45 miles an hour, but after fiveor six serious, major, gut-twisting turns, suddenly it's over, and you feelthe gentle caress of the denouement -- a mere ripple of track where the skyand the ground finally return to the places God put them. The station comesinto view; the brakes grip the sled. As the sled jerks to a stop, you try tolet go and suddenly realize your fingers are locked in a death-grip around theU-bar's steel handles.;    You're flushed, your ears are burning red, yourface is streaked with tears and you're grinning like an idiot as you stumbletentatively onto the platform. It felt like an eternity. And it felt likeabout 20 seconds. The entire experience was actually two minutes and 14seconds.;    Maximum G's;  &quot;Most of the intensity isn't just from the G's thatoccur in the lower parts of the ride,&quot; Mabillard explained, beaming at thesight of his first batch of willing victims. &quot;The 4.5 G's you felt are aboutthe most people can take. The real excitement comes from visual appeal and theunique combination of curves and corkscrews.&quot;;    Judging from the reactionsof three South Bay coaster aficionados from the American Coaster Enthusiasts(ACE), who were on that inaugural ride, Mabillard's diabolical design workedsplendidly. Among them, David Escalante, Meg Keehan and Mitzi Macon have 67years of coaster-riding experience and have savored the delicious terrors of275 coasters. On a scale of 1 to 10, they collectively rated the Vortex a9-plus.;    Keehan, the senior editor of the national quarterly magazineRollerCoaster!, said: &quot;Usually, for me, a memorable coaster is one where youget a lot of negative G's. This one was a completely different and weirdsensation you feel through your entire body. It was completely disorienting tonot be able to anticipate which way it's going -- just completely different.&quot;;   Macon, who had previous experience on another stand-up coaster, said shewas surprised the Vortex was as good as it was. &quot;Part of the difference hereis the seat didn't detract from the ride. The people who designed it tookgreat care to make restraints unobtrusive. You don't really notice they'rethere.&quot;;    Escalante, the Northern California regional representative for thegroup, rode the Vortex in a suit and still looked like an icon of suavityafter six rides. &quot;It's a short coaster, but it's a non-stop, constant thrill,&quot;he said. &quot;It's certainly on my top-10 list of favorite steel coasters. It wasjust pure hell on wheels.&quot;;  The Vortex; Where: Great America, Great AmericaParkway, off Highway 101, Santa Clara; When: Opens Saturday. Open weekendsthrough May 26.
