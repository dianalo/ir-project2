<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-1175 </DOCNO><TEXT>Naturally occurring solid tissue tumors in dogs were treated with microwave-inducedhyperthermia at a target temperature of 43{sup 0}C for 20 minutes plusradiation therapy (RHT), or with radiation alone (RT). Complicationsof both therapeutic regimens were classified as either medical or technical,and the medical complications were further subdivided into local (atthe tumor site) or systemic. The most common technical complication encounteredwas nonuniform heating (variability of greater than 1{sup 0}C) withinthe tumor tissue and this occurred in 92%{sup 0} of dogs treated withRt and in 97% of dogs treated with RHT. The most common localized medicalcomplications were epidermal necrosis (37%), inflammation (32%), andsuppuration (18%). The most common systemic complications were anorexia(16%) and fever (12%). There were no significant differences in the natureof, or the incidence of, complications between RT and RHT. The additionof heat to radiation therapy for localized solid tumors does not increasethe incidence of normal tissue complications.</TEXT></DOC>
