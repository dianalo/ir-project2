Prices jumped in early trading on a report that when OPECministers gather at that meeting, they may agree to reduceoutput by 5% to 7%. The report was issued by the Middle EastEconomic Survey, a trade publication based in Cyprus that isbelieved to have close ties to Saudi Arabia.</LP><TEXT>   Crude oil for March delivery jumped 19 cents a barrel tofinish at $19.36. Heatingoil and gasoline prices rose aswell.   There had been speculation in the market in recent daysabout a possible 5% cut, but the MEES report appeared to givecredence to those rumors. &quot;It certainly stirred things up, nodoubt about it,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, analyst for E.D. andamp; F. ManInternational Futures Inc.   There have been voluntary cuts over the past few weeks byOPEC members amounting to more than 400,000 barrels a day.Only Kuwait and Iraq, neither of which is producing much oil,haven't reduced output. But crude prices had declined sharplyin recent months as OPEC members pumped excess oil into themarkets, so those voluntary cuts weren't seen as enough tobolster prices significantly.   Additional reductions of 5% to 7% would bring OPEC output,currently about 24.3 million barrels daily, down to between22.6 million and 23.1 million barrels. Analysts say thedeeper cut would just about match projected demand for OPECcrude in the second quarter, when the need for oiltraditionally slackens.   Anticipation of OPEC cuts is expected to stabilize pricesbut is unlikely to trigger a major bullish trend. &quot;There'sstill a 150 million-barrel surplus of oil, mostly distillate,in inventory,&quot; Mr. Lebow said.   Also helping to buttress buying was a report that Iraqiand United Nations officials would meet again to discussrenewing Iraqi oil exports. The gathering would take place inVienna on Feb. 5, just before the OPEC meeting. But despitereports that progress was made when the two parties met thismonth, substantive issues remain, and it's unlikely that anyIraqi crude will make it into the marketplace for somemonths, experts say.   Separately, the London International Petroleum Exchangeyesterday launched a contract to trade unleaded gasoline. Aspokesman for the exchange said that about 270 contractstraded, considered a brisk pace for the first day of acontract. The contract trades in lots of 100 metric tons,deliverable into the areas of Amsterdam and Rotterdam in theNetherlands and Antwerp, Belgium.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices rose on strongdemand and persistent optimism related to strength in thecash market. Retailers bought large quantities of beef frompackers over the past two weeks, mainly because their meatinventories had dwindled through November and December.Yesterday the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's April cattlecontract rose 0.22 cent to 76.35 cents a pound, testing pricepeaks set in October. However, not all analysts are convincedthe price strength will continue. Dan Vaught, livestockanalyst for A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis, said hethinks retailers have more or less bought the beef they needand that demand may now ease a bit. Without sustained retaildemand, prices are unlikely to continue to advance, at leastin the next few weeks. After that, prices may get supportfrom the traditional spring run-up.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices rallied amid indicationsof tight supplies of physical metal. Platinum for Aprildelivery rose $5 an ounce to $351.50. The most dramatic signof tightening supply has been a rise in lease rates, the costof borrowing metal, one trader said. The large supplydeposited by the former Soviet Union into Swiss banks lastsummer as collateral for credit arrangements is rumored tohave been moved from the banks -- which had leased the metalout -- and returned to Russia or some other &quot;firm hands,&quot;parties that hold on to the metal rather than leasing it outor selling it, they said. Also contributing to the tightnessis improving demand, they said. The petrochemical industryhas been buying recently, a trader said. People who useplatinum industrially might be nervous about low supplylevels, said John Brimelow, an analyst at BV Capital in NewYork. He added that Japanese demand for physical metal hasbeen strengthening in recent months, even as Japanesespeculators sold platinum heavily. Mr. Brimelow said hethinks platinum prices have already seen their lows for theyear, citing diminished supply from Russia and possiblyrecurring disruptions in South African production.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices set new life-of-contract lows.Cotton for March delivery finished at 54.18 cents a pound,down 1.32 cents. Sharon Johnson, cotton specialist at CargillInvestor Services in Atlanta, attributed the drop to pricecuts by Paraguay and the Commonwealth of Independent States,which comprises former Soviet republics. Cotton from thoseareas has been a key factor in pressuring world prices lowerthis season, she said. Paraguay is apparently trying to avoida repeat of last year when it had unsold cotton at the end ofthe season, she said, and the C.I.S. is desperately seekingto generate hard currency. There's a lot of cotton availablein the world, she said, and as long as prices remain low,there's no incentive for buyers to step up and cover theirlong-term needs. Moreover, traders with bets that prices willfall have no incentive to take profits -- by buyingoffsetting contracts -- and are instead adding to their&quot;short&quot; positions. &quot;The market is giving absolutely no reasonnot to be bearish,&quot; she said. Prices could fall near, andpossibly below, 50 cents, she said; that would be the lowestsince 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
