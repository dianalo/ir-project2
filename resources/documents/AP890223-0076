Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered thethreat in a hand-written statement accompanied by an instantphotograph of American hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill andJesse Turner.   The group did not directly threaten the hostages, who appeared ina photograph released with the document to prove its authenticity.   The Arabic-language statement, delivered to the office of aWestern news agency in Moslem west Beirut, threatened to ``takerevenge against all those who took part in strong and ferociouscampaigns against Islam.''   In the photograph, shows the three bearded hostages from theknees up sitting on what appeared to be a bed and looking straightinto the camera.   Polhill's left arm and hand are noticeably thinner than in apicture released 14 months earlier, and his left sleeve appears tohave intentionally been hiked up to the elbow to show the arm.   The document said the revenge would cover ``all institutions andorganizations that insulted in one way or another'' members ofprophet Mohammed's family, meaning Moslems.   European governments have recalled their ambassadors from Iran toprotest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's decree last week that Moslemsseek out and kill Rushdie and his publishers because ``The SatanicVerses'' blasphemes Islam.   Authors have led demonstrations of outrage at the threat fromIran's fundamentalist patriarch, who has refused to accept Rushdie'sapology, and President Bush has called the threat an insult to thecivilized world.   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton who was born a Moslem in India, isin hiding with his wife in Britain and reportedly under policeguard. Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for Rushdie'smurder.   Steen, Polhill and Turner were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from thecampus of the American-affiliated Beirut University College, wherethey held teaching posts. Steen, 49, of Boston, taught journalism,while Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of businessand Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computerscience.   The three are among 15 foreigners missing and believed heldhostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. Nine ofthe hostages are American, including Associated Press chief MiddleEast correspondent Terry Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985and is the longest held.   ``Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had persistentlysought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages' issue, inaccordance with its principles and to show its good intentions inlight of international detente,'' the statement said.   ``But it seems that imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslemsshould go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were theprice of living in the shadow of international detente.''   The Beirut newspaper an-Nahar today said efforts to free foreignhostages in Lebanon have suffered now that Iran and the 12 EuropeanEconomic Community nations are at loggerheads over Iran's deaththreat against Rushdie.   Jihad threatened to strike against American and Israeli interestsfor supporting Rushdie and his novel and called on ``Moslems allover the world to stand against the laws of the jungle so thatadvocates of these laws would realize that real human values ... liein spiritual religions and not in the jungle's system.''   It described Rushdie's book and the support it has as ``the worsttype of insult against Islam's sacredness.''   The book was part of ``serious and wide-ranging programs underwayto strike against Islam because it is the force that fights moraland humanitarian degeneration,'' the statement claimed.   Many Moslems say Rushdie's book blasphemes Islam by portrayingMohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.   In Beirut, reactions to Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' havebeen slow and conflicting. An advisor to the Sunni Moslem grandmufti rejected Iran's ruling while the highest Shiite Moslemreligious judge advocated the death sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
