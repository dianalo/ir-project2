Officials at Alia hospital in Hebron said relatives of MustafaAhmed Halaika told them the man was shot by Jewish settlers in thenearby West Bank village of Shuykh.   He died of a bullet wound in the chest, and three other Arabswere wounded by gunfire in the village, the hospital officialssaid. Soldiers wounded two other Palestinians during a protest inNablus.   The three-day strike that began Friday was total. Stores wereclosed, streets were deserted and there was no publictransportation throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Halaika's relatives said five Jewish settlers opened fire whenPalestinians protested their presence in Shuykh, the hospitalofficials said.   A Palestinian driver who accompanied two journalists to thehospital quoted a 15-year-old villager, Nael Ayaide, as saying thesettlers beat him and another Arab.   Villagers began stoning the settlers, who then opened fire, thedriver quoted Ayaide as saying. The driver said Ayaide had a brokenarm.   The driver and hospital officials would not allow their names tobe used. A military spokesman said the army was investigating thereports.   The driver said the two Arabs wounded in Nablus were shot whensoldiers opened fire on protesters who erected barricades and threwstones.   According to U.N. figures, 200 Arabs have been killed since theuprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of theWest Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt inthe 1967 war. An Israeli soldier and a teen-age Jewish settler alsohave been slain.   The army prepared for more violence by restricting the movementsof more than 200,000 Palestinians with curfews and closures at 12refugee camps, towns and villages.   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers orders a metalworks closedfor three years. The army accused the owner, Nasser Youssef, ofmaking large nails that Arabs scatter on roads to puncture thetires of Israeli-owned cars.   In Bethlehem, protesters hung Palestinians flags on telephonewires and painted slogans on walls that said, among other things,``Observe the strike or we are going to burn.'' Israel has declaredthe Palestinian flag illegal.   Palestinian leaders ordered the three-day strike to protest thecurrent Middle East tour of George P. Shultz, the U.S. secretary ofstate. It began Friday in Cairo and will include a stop in Israelon Sunday.   Israeli officials said the trip is important for keeping thepeace process alive, but they do not expect dramatic results. PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes an exchangeof occupied land for peace, the basis of the U.S. plan Shultz ispromoting.   In a leaflet calling for the strike, underground leaders accusedShultz of trying to abort the rebellion.   ``The masses and activists must make more demonstrations and ... the land must burn under the feet of the fascist occupier,'' theleaflet said.   A general strike declared last Monday had little effect, andthis one has been seen as a test of the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabicword for uprising.   Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli leadershave said recently the rebellion was abating and Clinton Bailey, anArab affairs expert at Tel Aviv University, said Palestinians werelosing their enthusiasm.   ``It's kind of hard to get people out in the streets rightnow,'' he said. ``You don't have that mass identification you hadin the past.''   Shamir said in a statement carried Friday on Israel radio``there are signs the uprising is waning,'' but added that``undesirable intervention by Jews and Israelis'' helped keep itgoing. He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
