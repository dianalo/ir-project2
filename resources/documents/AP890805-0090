Hezbollah also denied holding any negotiations on a possibleprisoner exchange with Israel.   The Shiite Moslem organization was reacting to Israel's July 28abduction from Lebanon of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. Israel has saidit will trade the cleric, whom it links to terrorism, and up to 60other Shiites for three Israeli prisoners and the 17 foreignersheld in Lebanon.   Hezbollah said the abduction of Obeid has ``blocked chances fora swap,'' but it also said Israel should ``free Sheik Obeid first.''   One Shiite group in Lebanon claimed it killed a U.S. Marine itheld hostage in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. A second groupthreatened to kill another American but later said it had issued areprieve.   Hezbollah's statement came the same day a ranking MaroniteCatholic bishop crossed into Beirut's Moslem sector to meet withHezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.Bishop Khalil Abi-Nadir told reporters he carried a message fromPope John Paul II asking that the body of the Marine, Lt. Col.William Higgins, be returned to his family.   Hezbollah has demanded that Israel release the cleric, inaddition to Palestinians jailed during the anti-Israeli uprising inthe occupied lands and captured guerrillas.   The statement issued Saturday listed the five detainees as the``uprising heroes'' Nidal Zaloum, Itaf Alyan and Abdul-HadiSuleiman Ghanem and the ``Lebanese resistance heroes'' Anwar Yaseenand Soha Bishara.   It quoted an unidentified ``responsible source'' in Hezbollah assaying: ``We are as eager to obtain (their) release as much as weare eager to obtain the release of the detainees who belong to thesons of Hezbollah.''   Zaloum stabbed two Israelis to death in Jerusalem, and Ghanemcarried out an attack on a bus. Ms. Alyan was arrested before shecould carry out a bombing in August 1987.   Yaseen was arrested and accused of preparing an attack onIsrael's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.   Ms. Bishara shot and wounded Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, commanderof the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, on Nov. 7 insouth Lebanon.   Despite public disclaimers, Hezbollah is widely believed to bethe umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding most of the 16Western hostages in Lebanon.   Hezbollah said lists of other prisoners it wants released willbe prepared within days and presented to the Red Cross.   The chief delegate of the International Committee of the RedCross in Lebanon, Michel Dufour, told The Associated Press onSaturday that his group had not been approached.</TEXT></DOC>
