Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said the U.S. will raise the issue before the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Exports, or Cocom, a Paris-based policy organization for the U.S. and 15 of its allies.    The U.S. takes special precautions in licensing the export of computers and other products to Communist-controlled concerns, while all other Cocom members treat them the same as they treat Western companies, the Commerce Department official said. There are about 150 such companies, typically engaged in shipping or trading, based in Western Europe and non-socialist Asia.    A new Cocom consensus about these companies presumably would mean other members adopting at least part of the cautious U.S. approach.    The U.S. initiative was triggered by an interagency dispute, settled last week, over shipments to a company in Hamburg, West Germany, that is 51% owned by the Soviet Union. The Pentagon objected to the shipments while the Commerce Department allowed most to go through because of diplomatic and trade pressures. </TEXT></DOC>
