The concept has been pushed by environmental groups, which hope to encourage banks to contribute to conservation groups through more of so-called debt-fornature swaps. Legislation designed to promote such swaps is pending in both houses of Congress.    Internal Revenue Service ruling 87-124 spells out the criteria banks must meet in such arrangements. Deputy Treasury Secretary Peter McPherson discussed the ruling at a meeting at the Treasury yesterday with environmental groups, development organizations and lawmakers.    The Treasury generally has supported conversions of debt into equity or local currency, but relatively few swaps have occurred, partly because banks weren't certain about the tax consequences.    The new IRS ruling offers three scenarios. In one, a U.S. bank or company holds a loan to a developing country that was originally valued at $100. Its fair market value on July 1 is $60.    Under a prearranged plan with the country's central bank, the U.S. bank exchanges the debt for payment in that nation's currency that must be used in the country. The payment would immediately be credited to a U.S. charitable organization that does work in the developing country. In many cases, the central bank would offer an exchange rate more favorable than the prevailing rate as an incentive to make the exchange.    The U.S. bank could take a charitable deduction equal to the fair market value of the local currency it received. It also could take a loss equal to the difference between the fair market value of the currency and the original amount of the loan.    The other scenarios deal with situations in which U.S. banks or corporations essentially exchange debt for equity in start-up companies in the developing country.    The World Wildlife Fund said in a statement that it welcomes the ruling but is concerned that it may not apply to some swaps the group is considering. The organization said it is working with the Treasury to satisfy those concerns, but will continue to push for legislation that would allow other types of swaps.    A lawyer for the fund said it is worried, for example, that some debtor countries might be reluctant to have local currency credited to a U.S. organization rather than to one based in the developing country. </TEXT></DOC>
