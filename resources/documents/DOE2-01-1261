Temperatures of the fuel pin and coolantare calculated using a simple pin-in-a-pipe geometry. The mechanicalanalysis uses an implicit finite element formulation with linear shapefunctions which allow for general material behavior in the fuel and claddingincluding cracking and melting. This formulation provides a very convenientstructure for implementing different models and improvements in algorithms.The paper summarizes the FPIN2 methodology and presents results for thetransient response of both oxide and metallic fuel pins under similaroverpower transients.</TEXT></DOC>
