The government blamed speculators and uncertainty over who willwin national elections set for May 14. Peronist candidate CarlosMenem leads the candidate of the governing Radical Civic Union,Eduardo Angeloz, by about seven points in public opinion polls.   Prices for food, clothes, gas, public utilities and consumer andbusiness products of every type _ whether imported or not _ havesoared with the dollar's value against the austral.   Wages have not kept pace. Saul Ubaldini, general-secretary ofthe 4 million-member General Labor Confederation, calls it an``unprecedented emergency'' and wants massive wage increases.   The president of the Federation of Businesses in the FederalCapital (Buenos Aires), Osvaldo Cornide, said member stores mayclose down Thursday to protest the economic chaos.   Veronica Arbos, owner of a small leather shop, said Tuesday,``What's happening to Argentina? The exchange rate is going crazyand there's no obvious reason for it. We're helpless. It's notpossible to do business in this climate.''   Argentines paid 102 australs per dollar on Tuesday, up 20australs from the close of business Monday. Tuesday's currencydevaluation of just under 20 percent followed a devaluation ofalmost 12 percent from Friday to Monday.   The austral recovered slightly to 93 or 94 per dollar by theclose of business, but was expected to open Wednesday at about100-1.   Third-party candidate Alvaro Alsogaray of the rightistDemocratic Center Union blames the government, which ``let thegangrene advance and now there's no other way but to cut.'' Theformer economy minister was referring to the huge budget deficit,triple-digit inflation and non-payment of nearly $59 billion inforeign debt.   The national currency has slid since the Central Bank announcedon Feb. 5 it no longer would sell dollars on the open market toprop up the austral's value and dampen inflation.   At the close of business on Feb. 3, Argentines could buy adollar for 17.59 australs.   Price increases touched off riots eight weeks ago that left morethan 270 people dead in Venezuela, on South America's northwestcoast.   The consumer group Adelco said the price of flour increased by53 percent last week, coffee by 80 percent, noodles by 52 percent,cooking oil by 43 percent.   A survey by retail trade associations indicated that eggs,spaghetti, cheese, sugar and other products increased by at least150 percent over the past nine weeks.   The minimum wage is 3,500 australs a month _ about $35 atTuesday's exchange rate.   The dollar is a benchmark for prices and investments, given thetriple-digit inflation Argentina has suffered for four decades. InJune 1985, the austral was worth $1.25. Today, it is worth aboutone cent.   Wealthier Argentines bought dollars with their savings to hedgeagainst inflation.   Interest rates hit 80 percent a month on Tuesday as banks trieddesperately to keep investors from removing deposits to buy dollars.   No anti-government demonstrations or looting were reported, butpolice and private security guards were posted outside somesupermarkets and foreign exchange houses on Tuesday as a precaution.   Suppliers are delivering less goods, demanding payment sooner,and increasing financing charges. Retailers suspended credit cardservice and in many cases demand payment in cash. Both worry thatsales of existing stock won't cover the cost of new merchandise.   The Economy Ministry said Monday it will set maximum prices onabout 80 essential products, but minister Juan Carlos Puglieseconceded, ``I cannot come up with policies which will calm peoples'fears ... it is useless to insist that May 15 will follow May 14and nothing (bad) will happen. No one will believe me.''   President Raul Alfonsin, elected in October 1983 to replace amilitary regime, has had little success curbing budget deficits,spurring economic growth, and making payments on Argentina'sforeign debt.</TEXT></DOC>
