Common sense dictates that if you spend hundreds ofbillions of dollars more than you take in every year for a decade, eventuallyyou will have to pay the bill. Over the past 10 years, our government hasmanaged to spend some $2 trillion more than it has collected. Now we arepaying the bill in the form of the 1990-'91 recession.;    Federal deficitspending is the single biggest reason we are in a recession. Theadministration's own estimates indicate that, in spite of last year's budgetagreement, the 1991 deficit will be the largest in our history -- more than$318 billion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TO CURE RECESSION, WE NEED A SPENDING FREEZE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CommentaryRep.

The newborrowing adds to the $3 trillion already gobbled up by the federal debt. Themoney the government spent could have been used much more wisely andefficiently by the private sector. More important, every dollar of borrowingmakes interest rates higher. Rates in the United States are at least twopoints higher than they would be if we had no budget deficit. Imagine thestimulus of a 7 percent prime rate.;    We in Silicon Valley have long knownthat investment capital is the key to fueling the economy.;    But when thefederal government is borrowing at an alarming rate, investment capitalbecomes scarce. The drain on capital has threatening implications for ourhopes for a quick recovery. The biggest difference between this recession andthe one of 1981-'82 is that finding the necessary capital to jump-start theeconomy is likely to be much more difficult this time.;    In the early '80s,a large influx of Japanese and West German capital helped fuel the recovery.But in the early '90s Japan is preoccupied with its own economic problems,including a sharp drop in the Japanese stock market, and the Germans are busypouring billions of deutsche marks into revitalizing what used to be EastGermany.;    Furthermore, in the 1981-'82 recession, our banks and savings andloans were able to loan to our economy. Today, it is the taxpayer who isloaning, or giving, to them.;    The need to make real reductions in thedeficit has intensified. Reducing the deficit will require real spending cuts-- much more substantive than the snips in last year's budget agreement, whichactually allowed spending to grow in most areas. Even the administration'slatest approach falls a bit short; the budget just submitted allows for a 2.6percent increase in spending overall, much more than that in some categories.;   The most effective and politically palatable approach to controllingspending would be an across-the-board freeze. Last year's budget packagecontrolled spending in defense and Medicare but left virtually every otherarea free to grow with inflation.;    If we did nothing else, merely holdingspending to the previous year's level would save $50 billion a year.Unfortunately, that idea was not even allowed on the House floor for a vote inthe last Congress.;    We must focus on growth-oriented policies like agreater, permanent tax credit for research and development and fasterexpensing of productive equipment.;    A cut in the tax on long-term capitalgains also would be a spur to private investment at a time when our economydesperately needs it. Right now, our high capital gains rate (at a topmarginal rate of 31 percent) drives investments overseas -- to Japan, wherethe capital gains rate is 5 percent, and to Germany, which does not taxcapital gains at all.;    With capital as scarce as it is in America, we needto keep those investments here. The president has called for a study of theeffect of capital gains taxation. I agree. But here's what we know already:When the tax was reduced in 1978, federal revenue from capital gains increased-- from $8.5 billion in 1978 to $10.6 billion in 1980 and more than $20billion in 1984.;    Perhaps more than any other community in America, we inSilicon Valley know the immediate value of capital investments. Venturecapital helped make Silicon Valley what it is today. Capital can also helplift America out of this recession quickly.;    The surest way to make thatcapital available is for government to stop taking so much of it to financedeficit spending. The administration's budget performance last year wasdisappointing. Its budget proposal this year is an improvement. But a spendingfreeze would be even better.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM CAMPBELL  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910208  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  793  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 8, 199100039230,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
