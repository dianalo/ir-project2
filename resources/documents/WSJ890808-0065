The six-week campaign will run in national and regional newspapers and cost $500,000. It asserts that Philadelphia-based Laventhol can give midsized companies &quot;a refreshing alternative&quot; to big accounting firms that are merging.    &quot;The Big Eight firm . . . may already be feeling the pressure,&quot; the Laventhol ad states. &quot;Maybe the partner isn't calling as often. Maybe the team keeps changing -- and getting younger. And maybe you feel caught in the grips of a bureaucracy.&quot;    The Laventhol ad may signal rougher competition ahead for all accounting firms, say accounting business specialists. &quot;What was once a genteel and gentlemanly business has now become a battlefield with no holds barred,&quot; said James Emerson, publisher of Emerson's Professional Services Review.    Some of the merging firms aren't happy about the Laventhol ads being launched this week. Pointing to the ads' theme, Ray Groves, co-chief executive of Ernst andamp; Young, said that &quot;neither negativism nor puffery serve the business community well.&quot; Ernst andamp; Young was recently formed by the merger of Ernst andamp; Whinney and Arthur Young andamp; Co. Mr. Groves said a major reason for the merger was &quot;to enhance our ability to serve&quot; the middle market. Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells and Touche Ross andamp; Co. recently said they also plan to merge and Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. and Price Waterhouse said they're mulling a merger.    George Bernstein, chief executive officer of Laventhol, said he wouldn't be surprised if some Big Eight firms are upset at the ads. &quot;But advertising is getting more pointed and forceful and the days of soft competition and shadowboxing are over,&quot; he added. The Laventhol ad, for example, asks companies if they're interested in hiring CPA firms that are &quot;as interested in growing your business as they are their own&quot; -- a direct slap at accounting firms in the midst of combining.    &quot;An ad campaign of this scope is unprecedented for us -- and for most accounting firms,&quot; said Mr. Bernstein. &quot;We are obviously in an accounting war, and Laventhol is prepared to use all the tools of battle.&quot; He estimates that 80% of Laventhol's $350 million in annual revenue comes from midsized companies. Big Eight firms in recent years have been trying to attract more midsized clients, but a major portion of their revenue derives from serving large, multinational companies.    Other second-tier accounting firms are trying to run ads to draw away business or personnel from the bigger merging firms. But their themes are somewhat gentler than the Laventhol approach. Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co., a Los Angeles-based firm, recently began a campaign saying &quot;Mergers. Not for us]&quot; The ad states that the firm's title is &quot;a name that won't change.&quot;    Pannell Kerr Forster, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm, is about to begin a print campaign to attract employees of big merging firms. &quot;We will tell them that if they're tired of the disruption, they should talk to us,&quot; said Charles Kaiser, Pannell Kerr chairman.    Until this year, the total advertising outlay of the entire Big Eight firms was fairly modest -- ranging from $2 million to $4 million a year. But Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s Andersen Consulting unit recently began a more than $10 million name-recognition television and print campaign. </TEXT></DOC>
