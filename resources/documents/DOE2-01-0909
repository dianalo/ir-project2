The analyses use a volumetric creepmodel for wet crushed salt and an elastic-secondary creep model for thedeviatoric behavior of intact salt. The material parameters for the wetcrushed salt model are derived from hydrostatic consolidation tests performedon wet salt by Holcomb. The calculations show that the wet crushed saltdoes not significantly retard the rate of closure of shafts and driftsuntil the crushed salt is consolidated approximately 95% of intact saltdensity. The importance of the crushed salt deviatoric will be discussed.9 refs., 24 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
