The original lender, excited to lend $4 million atthe prime rate plus five percentage points, overlooked surveyreports showing the land soft and difficult to build on. Thatbank failed. So did one that lent another $1.5 million tofinish the project.</LP><TEXT>   Down the road a mile, a cluster of town houses sports amarina with year-round, all-weather docks, but the developercouldn't make it through a real-estate market suddenly turnedfrigid. Another local bank took a $3 million cold shower.   All these bank-wrecking loans have one thing in common:Woodbury C. Titcomb, chairman of Peoples Bancorp ofWorcester. But he didn't make the loans -- he turned them alldown.   &quot;Some incredibly foolish loan requests crossed my desk inthe past few years,&quot; says Mr. Titcomb, not exactly gloatingbut recalling with satisfaction his competitors' errors.&quot;Well, maybe I'm overstating it. The banks that eventuallymade those loans didn't think they were foolish. Some ofthose banks, of course, aren't around anymore.&quot;   To Mr. Titcomb, avoiding bad loans is just so much commonsense: Be prudent, anticipate what could go wrong and, aboveall, don't lend just because another bank might make theloan. But for years, Mr. Titcomb's stodginess was ridiculedby rivals, chastised by analysts and even questioned by hisown directors.   Today, he is the envy of New England bankers. Peoples issolidly profitable while many local lenders are staggered bylosses. It has bought two failed banks in the past two years-- increasing its assets to $900 million from $570 million --and is picking over the region's mounting rubble forbargains. The savings bank's stock is higher than the priceat which it was first offered to the public in 1986; that'strue of only five of 63 publicly traded savings banks in NewEngland, almost all of which went public in the mid-1980s,according to SNL Securities, a bank consulting firm.   &quot;When everybody was lending money like mad, they alllaughed at crazy Woodie, the guy with the buggy whip beingpassed by all those fast cars,&quot; says First Albany Corp.analyst Don Kauth. &quot;Now he is one of the few healthy banksaround, and they're calling him a genius.&quot;   Not everyone agrees that his Spartan practices have alwaysbeen appropriate, however. &quot;Because of Woodie's conservatism,Peoples just missed the train in terms of earnings andprofits in the '80s,&quot; says Clealand Blair, president of C.B.Blair Builders Inc. &quot;Overall, I think Woodie falls into thecategory of nothing ventured, nothing gained.&quot;   Mr. Titcomb responds that such a philosophy is fine forbusinessmen but not for bankers. He also notes his bank'sgenerally steady earnings.   Mr. Titcomb, robust at 67, is among the last of a losttribe: the maniacally frugal Yankee banker, the kind that,over two centuries, built the nation's strongest bankingculture. That culture, with its strict norms ranging fromcash-flow analysis to dress code, was largely swept away bythe swift currents of the 1980s. Many are wondering how itall changed so fast.   &quot;It's the herd mentality. Banking, as a regulatedindustry, has it worse than anyone,&quot; explains David Pringle,an analyst at Furman Selz Inc. in New York. &quot;Bankers admitit. For them, the right thing to do is always what everyoneelse is doing.&quot; In the 1970s, it was lending to developingcountries; in the mid-1980s, it was financing highlyleveraged transactions; in the late 1980s, it was realestate.   To find the headquarters of these troubled banks, justlook for the fanciest offices in town. To find Peoplesheadquarters, go into the downtown Galleria mall in this cityof 167,000, walk past the Chess King clothing store, turnright at the Fanny Farmer candy shop and take the escalatorto the second floor.   A $900 million bank -- in a mall? Sure. The office spaceis cheap and accessible -- a suitable setting for Mr.Titcomb.   At one time, he wouldn't have been so conspicuous. At Bankof Boston, in the 1950s and early '60s, he was one of manyyoung bankers slogging through loan-officer apprenticeship,five years of hazing by older bankers on the principles ofcredit and risk. &quot;It was a tough go, and people didn't moveup fast,&quot; says former Bank of Boston Chairman Richard Hill,72, who notes that Mr. Titcomb's class was the last hardenedby vivid recall of the Depression. &quot;Of course, now the bankdoesn't have time for the kind of `sitting at the knees'training that went on then -- and that's a shame.&quot; Bank ofBoston lost $394.5 million last year.   Mr. Titcomb grew up poor in working-class Reading, Mass.,but won a full academic scholarship to Brown. &quot;I never forgothow lucky I was, how I didn't succumb to temptation -- todrinking and carousing -- and how easily things might nothave worked out as well as they did,&quot; says Mr. Titcomb, stilla teetotaler.   At Bank of Boston, he became something of a credit-reviewzealot, grilling even top executives about their fiduciaryduties. &quot;I remember {my boss} took me aside one day and said,`Woodie, you're a fine loan officer, but in the last twomonths you've offended all the senior officers of thisbank,'&quot; he recalls. &quot;He told me I better tone it down or I'dhave to leave.&quot;   After 15 years and a rise to vice president for commerciallending, Mr. Titcomb did leave. He began 11 years ofmissionary banking -- using strict credit analysis to turnaround smaller banks -- before arriving in 1978 in Worcester,50 miles west of Boston, to run Peoples.   Soon, Mr. Titcomb showed that conservative doesn't meanuncreative. He quickly made Peoples the state's first savingsbank to dive into commercial lending, and he beganredirecting its loan portfolio -- at some pain to earnings --out of fixed-rate home mortgages and into moremarket-sensitive loans. &quot;Nothing wrong with most types oflending, as long as you do it by the book,&quot; he says.   By the mid-1980s, many mutual (depositor-owned) bankswanted to expand their loan portfolios amid the economicboom, and they saw a way: They raised capital by goingpublic. Soon, officers of dozens of sleepy mutuals were beingsigned up by New York investment bankers and were burnishingbalance sheets to show the healthiest possible earnings. Theresult: public offerings that more than tripled theircapital.   Mr. Titcomb did the opposite. Instead of inflatingearnings to maximize Peoples' offering price, he cleanedhouse, took writedowns on borderline loans and built hisloan-loss reserves -- all of which depressed earnings. Evenso, investment bankers figured that the bank could raise ahealthy $63 million in a public offering.   &quot;Woodie said he couldn't use that much capital, that itwas more than the bank's proper earnings level justified,&quot;recalls John Morrell, who handled Peoples' offering forKidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Instead, Mr. Titcomb fixed the offeringprice at $12.75 a share, raised only $38 million and irkedthe investment bankers, whose commission was cut from $4.4million to $2.6 million.   From 1986 to 1989, loans at New England's 714 FDIC-insuredbanks increased 36%, the agency says. Real-estate developmentand construction loans surged 59%.   Three institutions located near Peoples grew enormously.One was First Service Bank for Savings of Leominster, whichmore than doubled its assets and loans over those years bypaying handsome rates for deposits and swiftly lending outits growing pool of cash; it failed in the spring of 1989.Another pacesetter was Home Federal Savings Bank; it failedlast fall. And the third was BankWorcester Corp., which isslightly larger than Peoples and had a $29.5 million losslast year.   Peoples shunned the high-growth strategy. Mr. Titcomb,then as now, examined every loan, except for small homemortgages. Loans exceeding $100,000 require his signature.   Like the proper New England banker in the old joke -- theone who &quot;never lends to anybody he can't see from his window&quot;-- Mr. Titcomb kept his loans close to home. While many banksranged far afield in their lending frenzy, Peoples had morethan 90% of its loans in the county surrounding Worcester.   And Mr. Titcomb stuck by the old book in another way.While many bankers were making real-estate loans based solelyon collateral, the appraised value of an unfinished project,Peoples' loans were based on secured cash flow. A developerthat couldn't show pre-lease arrangements on a building hadto back the loan with revenue from other, existing projects.For instance, the developer of the pastel shopping mallcouldn't make any such guarantee, and Mr. Titcomb turned himdown.   By contrast, some doctors planning a small condominiumbuilding not far from Peoples' headquarters got a loan.&quot;They're doctors, they have a steady source of revenue thatwe've secured against the loan in case of problems,&quot; saysPeoples' &quot;workout&quot; chief, Sam K. Hokkanen.   The bank's strict lending culture was personally enforced.&quot;Knowing that Woodie may grill you on a loan can stop anylender cold,&quot; says Robert O'Toole, a senior vice president.&quot;You'd see guys from other banks at the bar or whatever,talking about the big loans they were pulling down. Our guyswould just hang their heads. It was very frustrating. Woodiewas driving a lot of them crazy.&quot;   Almost literally. &quot;There was an in-house psychologist atthe bank,&quot; says one loan officer who left in the mid-1980s.&quot;Suffice it to say we used him a lot.&quot;   Between 1986, when Peoples went public, and April 1989,when it bought $120 million in loans from the failed FirstService, Peoples' loan portfolio didn't grow; it held steadyat about $350 million.   Mr. Titcomb's board wasn't happy. &quot;Woodie's policy is thatthe loan customer is not our business partner,&quot; says HarryDewey, a director. &quot;People in the community would get turneddown for loans. Board members would take the heat.&quot; Customerscomplained. Employees left.   &quot;It was a very tough time,&quot; Mr. Titcomb acknowledges, &quot;butI said, `No, no, no.' We won't grow our loan portfolio theway the others do -- we just don't get paid to take thosekinds of capital risks. We stood alone -- all alone.&quot;   But about two years ago, the real-estate glut startedpulling down the eager lenders as loans that they made -- andthat Peoples rejected -- turned sour. Banks were left withpaltry collateral-empty buildings worth far less than whenthe loans were made. In addition to the bank failures, manysavings banks that converted from mutual to stock companieshave seen their shares plummet to pennies.   Not that any of this has changed Mr. Titcomb much. Thebanker, who is married and has two grown children, stilldelights in reviewing loan proposals, takes brisk morningwalks, plays tennis several nights a week and, when the pondbehind his house freezes, occasionally puts on pads for arough hockey game with some college kids. It is a life ofdiscipline, solitude, resisting temptation.   &quot;I've always been apart from the herd,&quot; he says quietly,sitting at his kitchen table after a long day. &quot;Sometimes, itcan be lonely and boring, and often you wonder if you'll everfit in. Now, though, not fitting in has suddenly become kindof fashionable.&quot;   And profitable. Mr. Titcomb, who owns 2.1% of the bank'sstock, earned $590,000 in 1989. His top executives also arewell paid. He says, a bit defensively, that they haveoutperformed competitors and deserve every penny.   On most matters, however, Mr. Titcomb remains a picture ofparsimony. Last fall, the bank's officers were happilyclosing the books on its third quarter, showing healthyearnings of 45 cents a share. But on his regular 6 o'clockwalk the next morning, Mr. Titcomb was worrying, he says,&quot;about worst-case scenarios for the New England economy.&quot;   He arrived at the office and announced an added $2 millionprovision for loan losses -- without bothering to findspecific troubled loans. That move almost doubled the bank'sprovision at the time and caused Peoples' first quarterlyloss since it went public in 1986.   &quot;Woodie is conservative -- a belt-and-suspenders man,&quot;says Corinne Turner, a director. &quot;I thought a belt would bemore than adequate to hold our pants up. Woodie goes with thesuspenders, too.&quot;   In the fourth quarter, Peoples returned to its normalrhythm, with earnings of $1.3 million, or 50 cents a share,and a modest increase of $800,000 in nonperforming assets --leaving nonperformers at $12.2 million, or 1.3% of totalassets. That's well below the 6.1% for all publicly tradedbanks in the region, according to brokerage firm Advest Inc.In all 1990, Peoples earned $3.15 million, or $1.19 a share,down from $5.53 million, or $1.90 a share, in 1989.   Peoples' health, and its good standing with regulators,will help it keep growing because there are few qualifiedbuyers of troubled banks. The number of bidders at FDIC saleshas declined by about two-thirds since Peoples beganattending them two years ago, according to James K. Hunt, thebank's acquisition specialist.   While most potential buyers sizing up a bank first examineits loan portfolio, Mr. Titcomb, like an enlistment officerlooking for recruits, begins by interviewing loan officers.&quot;I just have to talk to the lenders, check out their viewsand background, and I know what that loan portfolio will looklike,&quot; he says. &quot;Eventually, we'll check the portfolio, butit's an afterthought. The question is whether I'm seeing thetype of people who make good lenders, good bankers, or not.&quot;   Mr. Titcomb has built a staff, many of them young, thatJames McFarland, deputy regional director of the FDIC, calls&quot;one of the best management teams&quot; of any New England bank.   But the type of people who make good bankers were onceeasier to spot and maybe more plentiful. &quot;There was a bankermystique, a code of conduct,&quot; says Mr. Pringle at FurmanSelz. &quot;They wore three-piece suits and watch fobs, couldrecite the credit histories of a hundred customers and tookcold baths every morning. Guys like Woodie. It's too bad moreof the old guard aren't still around. Now's when banks reallyneed them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
