The central bank's influential bank rate was raised slightly yesterday to 12.41% from 12.40%, matching its highest level since early June. The bank rate is set weekly at a quarter percentage point above the average yield on three-month treasury bills at the government's Thursday auction.    The Bank of Canada uses its bank rate, the rate at which it lends money to banks, to signal the direction of its monetary policy. Currently, short-term Canadian interest rates are about four percentage points higher than comparable U.S. rates, because of inflation concerns.    Statistics Canada reported yesterday that the annual rate of inflation, as measured by a price index for domestically consumed goods, accelerated to 5.6% in the second quarter from 3.9% in the first period.    The inflation rate worsened despite a slowing of economic growth in the April-June period. The government agency said the gross domestic product rose 0.2% in the second quarter from the first quarter. It was the lowest rate of growth for any quarterly period in more than two years. In the first quarter, gross domestic product, which is the total value of goods and services produced by a country, rose 0.8%. </TEXT></DOC>
