A financial printer, Mr. Chiarella had made about $29,000 trading on information gleaned from tender-offer documents that he had seen in the course of his job. His conviction was reversed in a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1980; nevertheless, he &quot;went through hell&quot; for seven years, he says, explaining that he was shunned by friends and blackballed by the printing industry. His conclusion: &quot;I was a martyr for insider trading.&quot;    It was Vincent Chiarella's misfortune that his stock-market activities coincided with the onset of the continuing government campaign against insider trading. The campaign was spawned by concern over widespread insider-trading abuses in the mid-1970s, and the government's net has been cast with considerable effect: Since 1977, the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought 137 civil insider cases, compared with 47 in the previous 28 years.    Some of the names behind the statistics are now notorious among the general public. Others are unfamiliar outside financial circles. And if one bond they all share is public disgrace, their lives in the wake of that disgrace are often widely disparate. Michael David, the alleged mastermind of the so-called Yuppie Five ring, chauffeurs a limousine in New York while awaiting sentencing. Ivan Boesky, the dethroned king of the arbitragers, is a full-time student at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York while awaiting sentencing. Investment banker Dennis Levine, who implicated Mr. Boesky, among others, is in the Lewisburg, Pa., federal penitentiary; a recent visitor there reports that Mr. Levine is fit and tan from long hours of yardwork but is being ostracized by other prisoners, who view him as a stool pigeon.    There are those who seem to be doing very well. Paul Thayer, the former LTV Corp. chairman and assistant defense secretary convicted of obstructing justice, walked out of a Volunteers of America halfway house in Dallas last December and promptly shelled out an estimated $1 million for a 15% stake in a tiny California computer company. His partner in crime, a colorful Dallas stockbroker and radio personality named Billy Bob Harris, returned from prison to do a stint as a helicopter traffic reporter for a Dallas station; his performance drew a chorus of favorable phone calls.    Another who says he is faring nicely is Thomas Reed. The former Reagan aide whose insider-trading indictment created a major scandal in 1984 was found innocent by a New York jury and now heads a prosperous real-estate company outside San Francisco. He reached a civil settlement with the SEC in which he admitted no guilt but paid the $431,000 that the SEC said was his profit from illegal trading. That behind him, he professes &quot;to be living happily ever after.&quot;    In large part, the stories of these and other accused insider traders reflect what some perceive to be a deep public ambivalence toward their crimes. &quot;If you're doing 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour speed limit and everyone is passing you, what are you doing wrong?&quot; asks Daniel Silverman, a member of the Yuppie Five ring. Mr. Silverman pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.    Since Mr. Silverman's conviction, for which he received a suspended sentence, the 25-year-old former accountant has bought a Subaru dealership in Providence, R.I. Business &quot;is doing super,&quot; he says. He won't say how he managed such a turnaround, preferring instead to talk about the future. &quot;When I'm 30, I'll be down in Palm Beach writing my memoirs,&quot; he says. &quot;You'll hear more about me.&quot;    Then there are the darker stories, one being that of former Wall Street law clerk Manohar Lal Madan. He was convicted in 1983 of passing inside information on takeovers in a scheme that reaped participants more than $1 million. A federal judge sentenced him to six months in a Kentucky prison. About a month into his jail term, he suffered a stroke and was released. Today, at the age of 52, he is semiparalyzed and unemployed, and his attorney says he &quot;will never work again.&quot;    Attorneys for Ilan Reich, a Wall Street lawyer convicted of leaking information to Dennis Levine, became so worried about Mr. Reich when his case was first publicized that they organized a round-the-clock suicide watch. Mr. Reich, who had been sentenced to 366 days, was recently transferred to a Manhattan halfway house from a Danbury, Conn., federal prison. Mr. Reich is described by a friend as depressed and withdrawn.    Imprisonment, while far from grueling in minimum-security surroundings, has taken its toll on many once-powerful figures. &quot;Some of the most arrogant guys on Wall Street are crushed, really beaten people,&quot; says Peter Romatowsky, a former government prosecutor, who calls the phenomenon &quot;jailhouse conversion.&quot;    Still, for some who went to prison, life behind bars was the easy part. &quot;It's only when you get out into the real world that life gets tough,&quot; says Krishan Taneja, a 45-year-old civil engineer who made more than $1 million over six years trading on tips from Mr. Madan.    Formerly an aide in the office of the Manhattan borough president at the time that he engaged in illegal trading, Mr. Taneja spent a six-month term at the Allenwood, Pa., federal prison. During the day, he did drafting chores; at night, he worked out in the prison gym and studied in the library. He had ample time to ponder his crimes.    &quot;When it all started, I didn't even know what inside information was,&quot; Mr. Taneja insists. Around 1979, he says, he began reading about people being arrested for insider trading -- yet he continued trading even though he then knew it was illegal.    It's a decision he wouldn't repeat, Mr. Taneja says, explaining: &quot;In the long run, you are going to get caught.&quot;    On his release from jail early this year, Mr. Taneja's wife divorced him. He had no money. He lost an arbitration case seeking his old civil-engineering job. He applied for permits to be a stockbroker and to sell real estate and insurance but was told the licensing investigations could take months, if not years, given his background. &quot;For the first six months, I did nothing,&quot; he says.    Today, Mr. Taneja crisscrosses New York City in a yellow cab he leases on a weekly basis. He drives 70 hours a week and kicks himself for having blown his illegal profits in the stock market. He could use the cash, he says, for his own taxi medallion. &quot;Life is pretty tough,&quot; he says. He pauses, then adds: &quot;Ah, easy come, easy go.&quot;    Living much the same life that he was before insider-trading charges is Morgan F. Moore, a Connecticut psychiatrist. &quot;Believe it or not, my friends, relatives and patients -- with the exception of one -- were very supportive,&quot; says Dr. Moore, whom the SEC last year accused of trading on information gleaned while treating a corporate executive's wife. Dr. Moore, who faced civil, not criminal, charges, has since settled with the SEC and is continuing his psychiatric practice, albeit on a limited basis. &quot;I have received letters from at least one doctor, saying, 'More power to you,'&quot; says Dr. Moore.    R. Foster Winans, the former Wall Street Journal reporter convicted of leaking information about articles to two Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. brokers, turned notoriety into celebrity before his appeal of that conviction was denied by the Supreme Court earlier this week. He wrote a book about his case, spoke on ethical issues and appeared at New York society affairs. &quot;I like what {the conviction} has done to my life, if you can believe it,&quot; Mr. Winans told an audience in Washington shortly before the Supreme Court acted. On the day his conviction was upheld, he said, &quot;I'm not making any comment.&quot; His lawyer said that he would move to have Mr. Winans's 18-month jail term reduced but that Mr. Winans would probably be reporting to federal prison within 30 to 60 days.    Kenneth Felis, one of the Kidder Peabody brokers in the Winans case, didn't return phone calls when the Supreme Court upheld his conviction. Not long before that, he said, &quot;I've done my best to put it behind me, but it comes up at least once every week.&quot;    Mr. Felis has been running his family-owned printing business in Bridgeport, Conn. In doing so, he found he couldn't pursue lucrative government printing jobs because he is a convicted felon. But he harbors little bitterness. &quot;I have no animosity toward the government or anyone,&quot; Mr. Felis said before the Supreme Court acted. &quot;You can eat yourself up with that kind of attitude. My goal is just to raise my family and have all of us prosper.&quot;    The high court was kinder to Raymond L. Dirks, but that didn't mean he worked happily ever after. As a securities analyst in 1973, he uncovered the Equity Funding stock-fraud case and alerted the SEC to it. The agency told Mr. Dirks it was too busy to probe the matter, but it eventually looked into Equity Funding -- and slapped Mr. Dirks with an insider-trading action for notifying his clients before the matter became public. He fought that all the way to the Supreme Court and won in 1983.    His luck ran out, however, when John Muir andamp; Co., a highflying brokerage firm, collapsed in 1980 amid SEC charges of misplaced funds. Mr. Dirks, who was in charge of underwritings at Muir, denies any wrongdoing. He was suspended from acting as a principal in a securities firm for six months, a period that ended this year after appeals petered out.    After Muir's collapse, Mr. Dirks scraped for work as a self-employed analyst. He resurfaced in 1985 at the firm of Steinberg andamp; Lyman, helping bring fledgling insurance companies public. Last November, he moved to the New York brokerage firm of Baird, Patrick andamp; Co., where he now heads an 18-person insurance-analyst unit. &quot;I'm excited about insurance stocks again,&quot; says Mr. Dirks, who is now 53. &quot;They're tremendously undervalued.&quot;    Fourteen years of legal battles have left Ray Dirks older, wiser -- and better connected. &quot;Some of the biggest money managers in the country return my phone calls now because they've heard my name,&quot; he says. &quot;People want to know what I'm like. I can generally get in to see anybody I want.&quot;    He plays down the rigors of his long fight. &quot;I am a rebel by nature. I thrived on it,&quot; Mr. Dirks says. &quot;But reality sets in when you have to pay lawyers. It was depressing.&quot;    He adds: &quot;I still get calls from guys wanting me to uncover some scams. I tell 'em I'm too busy. Besides, there's no money in it.&quot;    If Mr. Dirks is more or less back where he started, Darius N. Keaton is at a far remove from his business origins. The 63-year-old former director of Santa Fe International Corp., who admitted trading on advance knowledge of the company's 1981 takeover by the Kuwaiti national oil company, last summer emerged from 55 days in a California prison camp to champion the causes of narcotics legalization and prison reform.    &quot;In prison, I became friends with three of these black fellows and came to understand their problems,&quot; says Mr. Keaton, explaining that his jailhouse discussions changed the way he views criminals and drugs. &quot;I became a convert,&quot; he says. &quot;I say legalize dope, get rid of drug-related crime and use the profits to help out the addicts. I've been a Republican all my life, but I'm beginning to wonder.&quot;    Mr. Keaton is now working off 1,000 hours of court-ordered community service helping San Francisco-area parolees find jobs with local corporations. &quot;I'm not complaining about what {federal prosecutors} did to me,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody makes a mistake in life. Some of us are dumb enough to get caught.&quot;    And then there is Mr. Chiarella, the self-described &quot;martyr for insider trading.&quot; A widower, Mr. Chiarella found women quickly lost interest when they learned of his past. &quot;They all thought I was some sort of Ponzi,&quot; he says. More important, after 20 years as a printer, he was forced to drift from job to job, two months here, two days there, always living near the poverty line. Extra cash went to pay legal bills. One year he listed 18 separate printing jobs on his W-2 form; every mention of his past in the press presaged the end of each job.    &quot;All my life I was a printer, a good worker, no trouble,&quot; says Mr. Chiarella. &quot;All of a sudden, you're nothing anymore. What do you do?&quot;    Insider trading seemed a lofty term for the guessing game he and other printers played at Pandick Press in New York in the 1970s. They spent hours trying to decode identities of buyers and sellers in tender-offer documents they prepared; only Mr. Chiarella, however, played the market with his hunches. To this day, he doesn't know how he was caught.    After years of legal appeals, Mr. Chiarella's outlook suddenly brightened in 1980 as he sat in the rear of a Washington courtroom, watching spellbound as his case was argued before the Supreme Court. &quot;The solicitor general isn't into his argument for five minutes and the justices are hacking at him, throwing jabs at him,&quot; Mr. Chiarella recalls. At one point, &quot;{Justice William} Rehnquist comes down off the bench and talks to the guy, who is starting to sweat like a pig. That was the first ray of hope.&quot;    News of his conviction's reversal crossed the Dow Jones news wire on a March morning in 1980; Mr. Chiarella framed the headline and hung it on his apartment wall not far from a bowling trophy. It would be years, however, before his life would return to normal.    Today, Mr. Chiarella is back at his old job at Pandick after winning an arbitration suit suggested by his union a couple of years ago. He walks to work each day at 4 p.m., a bitter man. &quot;I was the guinea pig,&quot; he says. &quot;I disgorged $29,000 to the SEC. Ivan Boesky could buy cigarettes with that.&quot;    He wants little except to be left alone. &quot;I'm at the twilight of my career as a printer,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope to just fade away.&quot;    ---                  What Happened to 50 People               Involved in Insider-Trading Cases                    The Boesky-Levine Ring   IVAN BOESKY -- Wall Street's biggest arbitrager.
