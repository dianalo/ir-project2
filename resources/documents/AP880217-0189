Sen. Paul Simon said bluntly on Wednesday that his presidentialcampaign cannot continue unless he draws more money. By contrast,well-heeled Democrat Michael Dukakis has $4 million available forthe most pivotal date of the 1988 primary season on March 8.   Rep. Jack Kemp, straining for the Republican nomination againstbetter-funded opponents, said his campaign is in the black andcounting on his third-place showing in New Hampshire to help boostfund raising.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who relied on this year's federalmatching funds to pay off sizable debts, said Wednesday that moneyis not a problem for him at this point.   ``We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said.   Gephardt will need a good influx to remain competitive withDukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,D-Tenn. in the South.   Gore is not as flush as Dukakis, but has already has a big mediajump on his opponents, thanks to his strategy of concentrating onthe South while his opponents vied on the battlefields of Iowa andNew Hampshire.   Last week Gore launched a $1 million-plus TV campaign across thecountry.   ``We will outspend every other candidate toward Super Tuesday,''deputy press secretary Paul Risley said. He declined to give anoverall spending figure, but said said the campaign has $2.2million in cash on hand and intends to spend a minimum of up to $3million on media alone toward Super Tuesday.   He said the current Gore commercials, featuring a biographicalmessage, are running in 14 South and border states and nationwideon Cable News Network and other cable stations.   Dukakis, who has concentrated considerable resources on thedelegate-rich Super Tuesday states of Florida and Texas, has $4million in the bank, deputy press secretary Steven Akey saidWednesday. He said the campaign's media buys had not been decidedyet for Super Tuesday, but that several fund-raising events arescheduled and, ``We have the resources to go the distance.''   Despite Simon's successful fund-raising events in Boston and inNew York last week, where $140,000 was raised on the heels of hissecond-place finish in Iowa caucuses, his campaign has debts ofnearly $500,000, said his press secretary, Terry Michael.   ``I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota, and we haveto get additional campaign contributions. Those two things have tobe there, otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw,'' Simon said.   Simon spokesman David Carle later tried to paint the financialpicture more positively.   He said Simon hoped to raise $150,000 at four events in Chicagoon Wednesday night. Another event was planned Thursday morning inSt. Louis, and a ``very, very good'' response was coming from the48,000 solicitation telegrams the campaign sent out to capitalizeon the Iowa results, he said.   ``These two weeks are shaping up to be record-breaking for thecampaign,'' in terms of money, Carle said, estimating a total of upto $600,000 might be raised.   Babbitt, who is to announce Thursday whether he will continuehis struggling presidential bid, will end up about $150,000 to$200,000 in debt if he drops out now, said his press spokesman VadaManager.   He said the campaign has about $30,000 in cash on hand, and thatcontributions ``slowed to a trickle'' after Babbitt's poor showingin the Iowa caucuses last week.   ``After New Hampshire, it's going to be worse,'' he said.   On the Republican side, Kemp ended the year seriously in debtbut said his campaign has raised $300,000 a week for the past fiveweeks, and is now operating in the black, thanks also to some $3.9million in federal matching funds he received since Jan. 1.   He said he intends to hit up his list of 110,000 contributors ina fund-raising push for Super Tuesday.   Super Tuesday could mean budget-watching of a different type,with the well-heeled Vice President George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole andformer TV evangelist Pat Robertson budgeting to keep spending lowenough so they can save their big cash caches for states that comelater.   Bush has raised $20.4 million so far and has a series offund-raisers scheduled to reach the campaign's goal of $33 million,said treasurer Fred Bush. Although the campaigns are limited by lawto $27 million in overall primary campaign spending, legal andaccounting costs are exempted from the limit.   Bush, with $8 million in the bank, is not worried about the cap,however, said spokeswoman Ede Holiday. Although he had spent morethan $13 million by the end of the year, only $7.9 million wasapplicable against the ceiling.   Dole was well-situated with $4.1 million in available cash andno outstanding debts, said campaign spokesman Tim Archie.   Pat Robertson, on the other hand, had spent $12.4 millionagainst the cap, and Dole spent $9.5 million against it by the endof 1987.   Well-funded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spendenough on the later states without going over the $27 million limit.</TEXT></DOC>
