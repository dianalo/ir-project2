TRIMS. Nopickup.</HEAD><BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As the East German capital emptied today fora third weekend of visits to the West, Communist leader Egon Krenztook his appeal for public trust to the streets of Leipzig, a hubof recent protests.   On Friday, other leading Communists said East Germany shouldconsider stronger ties with West Germany to rescue this country'stroubled economy.   During his stroll through the center of the grimy industrialcity of Leipzig, Krenz was besieged by shoppers and workers whopounded him with questions about the nation's future, the officialADN news agency reported.   ``Can the desperate situation with the economy be improved? ...Will those responsible for the misery be punished?'' residentsasked Krenz, ADN said.   They offered ``question after question, but alsoencouragements,'' ADN said, quoting strollers as yelling: ``Egon,keep it up! We wish you health!''   Protests in Leipzig, a weekly ritual, have attracted hundreds ofthousands of people. The demonstrations there and elsewhere in EastGermany, coupled with an exodus to the West through other East bloccountries, prompted East Germany to open its borders to the Westearlier this month.   The generally positive report on Krenz's visit appeared aimed atboosting the leader's image at a time of disillusionment withCommunist Party stalwarts.   Krenz reportedly faces strong opposition to his continuedleadership within the party, which is split on how to proceed withreforms. He has admitted he could be replaced at a major partymeeting next month.   In another move aimed at winning public confidence, ParliamentSpeaker Guenther Maleuda said in an interview published by theyouth newspaper Junge Welt that parliamentary elections could comeas early as autumn 1990 if a new election law can be worked outearly next year.   He did not indicate the vote would be truly democratic, as othertop officials have. However, he said he could envisionparticipation by groups other than the current established partiesaligned with the Communists.   The rush for the borders began early, with more than 300,000crossing into West Berlin and West Germany before nightfall Friday,and hundreds of thousands more traveling through the night.   Trabant and Wartburg cars backed up as far as 25 miles at bordercrossings into West Germany's Bavaria state, and East Berlin'sPotsdamer Platz crossing in the Wall for pedestrians was packed bythousands before noon.   East German public transportion was so overwhelmed with thewestward travelers that the federal Transport Ministry issued anappeal to citizens late Friday to avoid using the rail system.   Most of the East Germans were just headed for visits, mostly toshop.   However, a new surge of East German refugees also has becomeapparent over the past few days, with more than 3,000 applying forresettlement in West Germany on Thursday and Friday.   Also today, ADN said Werner Eberlein, a member of the rulingPolitburo and head of the party's disciplinary committee, calledfor a thorough probe of ``misuse of office, corruption, personalenrichment and other guilts.''   He did not say exactly who he was referring to. But the partyhas already launched an investigation into the actions of formerparty chief Erich Honecker and other top officials of the oustedleadership.</TEXT></DOC>
