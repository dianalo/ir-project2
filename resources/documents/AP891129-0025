In one case, the department's Office of Inspector General saidTuesday, a single farm operation collected about $2.8 million insubsidies, 56 times the $50,000 limit set by law.   The report did not identify the recipient of the huge payment,and inspector general officials refused to provide further details.   However, the report's appendix showed a ``maximum paymentlimitation'' for Jackson County, Ark., with an audit figure of$2,867,614 in ``questioned costs and loans.''   The entry also showed that $2,788,077 of the total as``unsupported costs and loans'' by the department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, the agency that handlescommodity subsidy programs.   Other areas of abuse also were cited in the agency's semiannualreport to Congress on investigative and audit activities during thesix months that ended Sept. 30.   Those abuses included crop insurance overpayments, loopholes indebt restructuring by the Farmers Home Administration and flaws inthe export subsidy program.   By law, the crop subsidies, called ``deficiency payments,'' arenot supposed to exceed $50,000 per person per year. These aredirect payments to help make up the difference between depressedmarket prices and higher ``target'' prices set by the government.   For example, last month the price of corn at the farm was $2.20a bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $2.84.   A ``person'' can be an individual, a joint stock company, acorporation, an association, a trust or some other legal entity.   The report said ``abuses in the program continued'' despiteefforts by Congress in the 1987 Omnibus Reconciliation Act to closeloopholes. Overall, in 1987, an estimated $66 million was paid tofarmers who dodged the $50,000 limitation.   Investigators have found that big operators often reorganize toqualify additional ``persons'' for the purpose of collecting largerpayments.   In one case, an individual used relatives, employees andbusiness associates as ``persons'' under the program, the reportsaid. Those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987. Paymentstotaled about $2.8 million for the two years, plus more in 1988 and1989, which are under review by the department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service.   ``We have recommended that ASCS improve its review proceduresand withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined,''the report said.   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. PatrickLeahy, D-Vt., said of the report:   ``Outrageous payments such as these undermine public support forfarmers. A few bad apples are giving all farmers a bad name.''   A spokesman for the National Farmers Union, Michael V. Dunn,said loopholes are ``something we've been concerned about'' for along time.   ``We end up with subsidies going to all types of corporationsand corporate investors,'' Dunn said. ``We have long advocatedtargeting those payments to family sized operations.''   Other findings of the inspector general's report included:   _Loss adjustment errors by the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. andreinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at$91 million out of $716 million paid out in claims. Underpaymentstotaled $1.6 million.   _Under Farmers Home Administration debt-restructuringprocedures, borrowers were able to sell off security property andstill qualify for ``buyout'' benefits. Buyouts allow borrowers tohave debts written off by FmHA after buying back the note at 30cents on the dollar, based on the value of the remaining propertyheld as collateral.   ``For example, one borrower improperly disposed of a portion ofcollateral securing outstanding debt totaling $160,000,'' thereport said.   ``However, since the borrower qualified for the buyout, FmHAallowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30 cents on thedollar, a loss to the government of $112,000.''   The report recommended FmHA seek legislation that would deny a``buyout'' to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith underthe debt-restructuring program.   _Subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreigncountries are provided under the Export Enhancement Program, orEEP. Private exporting companies collect the subsidies, or bonuses,in the form of surplus commodities held by the department'sCommodity Credit Corp.   The subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customerslower prices than otherwise would be the case. That enables U.S.products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers,notably the European Economic Community, which has export subsidyprograms of its own.   But investigators said they found that ``some countries in theprogram do not show strong competition with U.S. commodities.''Overall, the report questioned EEP bonus payments of $151 millionfor transportation costs, which ``may not be allowed'' by federallaw, and payments of $89.8 million that resulted from ``a possiblemiscalculation of world prices.''</TEXT></DOC>
