This is largely attributable to an economicrecovery propped by domestic demand. Particularly, revived energy-intensivematerial-producing industries, like steel and chemicals, in combinationwith favorable business conditions in such sectors as housing constructionand transport, contributed much. Favorable economic activities bolsteredby consumption and equipment investment, soft crude oil prices and otherunderlying trends remain unchanged in fiscal 1988, and energy demandis kept upward. Although the tempo of a growth differs among energy sources,primary energy supply and total final energy consumption alike are expectedto grow at almost the same pace as in fiscal 1987 (around 5%), or slightlyslower than that. As the United States and West Europe also have recentlyproduced signs of rising energy demand, primarily electricity, it isreasonable to consider that energy supply/demand mix is changing withthe reverse oil shock as a turning point. This means a need for reviewingvarious long-term energy supply/demand outlooks which have been preparedbased on conventionally recognized situations. Especially, it is becomingimportant, from the aspect of the security of stable energy supply, toprepare several scenarios to predict energy demand and consider how tocombine corresponding energy supply to the prediction with energy mix.15 figs., 17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
