Even if you don't like popular music, you'll love the title animation of &quot;Summer Night Music&quot; (airing on most PBS stations on Saturdays, July 2-Aug. 6, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT; and on WNET/Thirteen on Thursdays, midnight-1:30 a.m. EDT). It's a series of six concert/interview films by independent film maker Robert Mugge that focuses not on the muddy mainstream but on the lesser known but fresher tributaries that keep it from becoming a swamp.    From where do the new sounds flow? One answer is provided by Linda Ronstadt in the first film, &quot;The Return of Ruben Blades&quot; (about the salsa star): &quot;Whenever pop music gets stuck, like it did in the '70s, it always looks to some ethnic current.&quot; Ms. Ronstadt feels that the next current will be Hispanic -- partly for personal reasons (she just released an album of folk songs from her Mexican-American girlhood), and partly because she believes, &quot;That's where the cultural swing of the country's going to go. There's so much Spanish spoken, English is going to be a minority language soon.&quot;    Here we see Ms. Ronstadt's musical sophistication (ethnic sounds do indeed revitalize pop); her social naivete (there is no evidence that English is becoming a minority language, even in Los Angeles); and her craftsmanship (she and Mr. Blades take great care with the Spanish duet they are recording). These ingredients -- musical sophistication, social naivete and craftsmanship -- are recurring themes in &quot;Summer Night Music.&quot;    Pop music did get stuck in the 1970s, as evidenced in the second film, &quot;The Gospel According to Al Green.&quot; Instantly recognizable are Mr. Green's early-'70s hits: &quot;Tired of Being Alone,&quot; &quot;Let's Stay Together,&quot; &quot;I'm Still in Love With You.&quot; At a time of increasingly packaged pop, Mr. Green's richly inflected vocals reminded listeners that the original ethnic current in American music was, and is, Afro-American -- in this case, the gospel singing of Mr. Green's Arkansas boyhood.    The form of Mr. Green's music wasn't stuck in the '70s, but the content was. Like all rock 'n' roll for the previous 20 years, he was singing about love and sex. And his career was taking off with a string of hits, female fans tearing at his clothes, and double billing with stars like Smokey Robinson. But something was missing. Mr. Green discovered what in 1973, when the night after a concert, he &quot;woke up at 4:30 in the morning, praising and rejoicing in the Lord.&quot; Before long, he quit pop and became a successful gospel singer (his records have won several Grammys) and a preacher in Memphis.    As the film amply illustrates, this transformation has not diminished Mr. Green's charisma. On the contrary, he's thoroughly convincing when he says: &quot;It takes electricity to be inspiring . . . and that electricity has nothing to do with sex; it has something to do with the other realm.&quot; As for the type of performer who enters middle age still clinging to the derivative spark of rock 'n' roll, Mr. Green is gently dismissive: &quot;He's still trying to stay up all night . . . He's still chasing young girls . . . There's a time when a man's got to put away some of the childish things.&quot;    Along with the musical sophistication of the artists he profiles, Mr. Mugge clearly admires their zeal to convey something more than the usual messages of love and sex. But unfortunately, not all of them have something as vital as the black church to fall back upon. Too many display their social naivete by finding inspiration in the 20th century's favorite substitute religion: utopian politics.    In Ruben Blades's case, &quot;naivete&quot; is too mild a word. Salsa originated as dance music, but Mr. Blades turns it into political broadside. From his middle-class background (he graduated from the University of Panama and Harvard Law School) he acquired ambition: He declares his intention to return to Panama and become &quot;a candidate for the highest office.&quot; From his years on the pop music circuit (to say nothing of Harvard) he acquired an amorphous Third Worldism: After quoting Pablo Casals on the obligation of artists to defend &quot;liberty and free inquiry,&quot; he calls the U.S. Constitution &quot;a Hollywood set, an empty house.&quot;    Gil Scott-Heron, the subject of the fourth film, &quot;Black Wax,&quot; is socially naive in the sense that he refuses to update his material. A &quot;blues-ologist&quot; who came of age in the '60s, Mr. Scott-Heron has enough musical talent and verbal wit to put a whole generation of rappers to shame. On subjects like drug abuse and the racial hypocrisy of Washington, he is quite trenchant. But too often he recites stale '60s ditties like &quot;Whitey on the Moon,&quot; or declaims about the superiority of black heroes such as W.E.B. Dubois to &quot;white heroes&quot; such as John Wayne. Somehow it's appropriate that he conduct this dialogue with wax figures instead of living people.    Nowhere does the pseudo-religiosity of utopian politics manifest itself more clearly than in &quot;Cool Runnings: The Reggae Movie,&quot; Mr. Mugge's film of the 1983 Sunsplash festival in Montego Bay, Jamaica. For example, a group called Third World shows impressive craftsmanship in its fusion of reggae with other styles of popular music, including jazz. Yet its musical sophistication is matched with an almost willful social and political naivete. Third World's message is &quot;peace, unity, love for all so that humanity can change the problems of the world by love.&quot;    Such is the ersatz religion of the majority of popular musicians today -- even the traditionalists profiled in the final film, &quot;Hawaiian Rainbow&quot; (although this may be the result of a distortion in Mr. Mugge's lens). The only rebuttal is a warning, that this loving creed usually has a not-so-loving side, directed at anyone currently designated as an oppressor of the people. Like the American folk-satirist, Tom Lehrer, the pop music one-worlder has to admit that, &quot;There are some people who do not love their fellow human beings, and I hate people like that.&quot;    Now for the good news. Mindless politics isn't the only way to transcend the love-and-sex cliches of popular music. Sonny Rollins, the third film's &quot;Jazz Colossus,&quot; is heir to a tradition that has redefined itself as art. The price of this redefinition has been a drastic loss of audience -- until recently. Mr. Rollins says he no longer has the &quot;illusion&quot; that his music can influence things for the better. All he wants is for people to enjoy and appreciate it. Lesser talents would do well to emulate such humility, accompanied as it is by true artistry. And who knows? Ask the enthusiastic crowds attending the Tokyo premiere of Mr. Rollins's spellbinding &quot;Concerto for Tenor Saxophone and Orchestra.&quot; Maybe for them, the world was influenced, just a bit, for the better. </TEXT></DOC>
