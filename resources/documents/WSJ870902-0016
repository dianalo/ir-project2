Among the central banks reported to be intervening was the U.S. Federal Reserve, in what traders said was its first such action in several weeks.    Pessimism about progress on narrowing the huge U.S. trade deficit was cited in explaining yesterday's dollar sell-off. The decline continued the currency's downward move that began more than two weeks ago with the release of disappointing June trade data.    In pushing the dollar lower, traders seemed to ignore reports of worsening tensions in the Persian Gulf this week. Fear of a widening of the Iran-Iraq war spurred buying of dollars earlier this summer as traders and investors sought the relative security of U.S.-denominated investments.    Traders said the dollar's drop was modest considering the extent of the negative market sentiment. They credited central bank buying with stemming the decline.    James H. Hohorst, managing director, foreign exchange, at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said the day's activity resembled &quot;trench warfare,&quot; with traders taking on the central banks in a struggle that gained them little ground.    &quot;We're not at any (significantly) different rates than we've been at in recent days,&quot; he said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at or near its lows for the day at 1.8085 West German marks, compared with 1.8160 late Monday, and 141.45 Japanese yen, compared with 142.50.    The dollar was quoted at 141.25 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Yesterday was the first time the U.S. Federal Reserve had joined other central banks in buying dollars in the market since the currency began heading sharply lower Aug. 14, according to traders. Citing policy, a Fed spokesman declined to confirm or deny any reports of market activity.    Traders said the West German and Japanese central banks also supported the dollar in their home markets yesterday. The Swiss National Bank bought dollars as well, according to a bank spokesman.    Market participants generally say the aim of the central banks is not to halt the dollar's drop but to keep its downward move gradual and orderly.    &quot;I think they'll keep lowering the levels at which they come in and buy dollars to keep an orderly decline,&quot; Paul R. Loffredo, vice president and chief dealer at Security Pacific National Bank, New York, said.    Concern about the U.S.'s merchandise trade gap was stirred by a report quoting Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter as predicting no major narrowing of the deficit this year.    Although the Iran-Iraq war has appeared to heat up this week, traders said, the situation isn't expected to prompt the kind of dollar-buying that accompanied the rise in tensions in that area earlier in the summer. Mr. Loffredo said the Persian Gulf issue has been &quot;played out&quot; in the market and that the trade deficit now overshadows all other factors affecting the dollar.    Manufacturers Hanover's Mr. Hohorst also said traders have become &quot;a little numb&quot; to news from the Middle East. He said that's because, despite the many recent threats of a widened war in the region and talk of a disruption of world oil supplies, &quot;nothing seems to happen.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $4.20 an ounce to $454.80 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $455.40 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                LATE NEW YORK TRADING                Tuesday, Sept. 1, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
