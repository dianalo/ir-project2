(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A settlement was reached Tuesday in alawsuit against the U.S. importers of Audi after the judge setaside a jury verdict that a faulty Audi transmission caused a 1985accident, a company spokesman said.   The court refused to confirm the agreement, citing an order ofconfidentiality. But Joe Bennett, a spokesman for Audi in Detroit,said New York Supreme Court Justice Matthew F. Coppola agreed to amotion by an attorney for Volkswagen of America, Audi's U.S.importer, to set aside the jury's liability verdict.   Bennett said the judge cited inadvertent references topost-manufacturing design changes despite the court's ruling to thecontrary, the jury's exposure to media coverage of the trial andreported discussion among jurors about the case beforedeliberations began.   Bennett said it was learned that jurors had been talking amongthemselves since the second day of the trial.   ``The court's concern that the defendant's rights might havebeen prejudiced as a result requires that the verdict be set asidein the interest of justice,'' Bennett said, quoting from thejudge's decision.   On Thursday, the jury found Volkswagen of America liable for the1985 accident in which Marie Lynette Ruston, 38, of Purdys wasinjured. A 1979 Audi driven by Sally Mears of Scarsdale suddenlyaccelerated, striking a car, which in turn hit Ms. Ruston's 1979Toyota.   Ms. Ruston suffered back injuries, underwent disc surgery andhad to give up her nursing career as a result of the accident,according to testimony given during the liability trial.   Ms. Mears bought the used car in 1983. It had been the subjectof two recalls but neither Ms. Mears or the previous owner hadtaken it in for the repairs.   The jury exonerated Ms. Mears and blamed the accident on adefective transmission. It began hearing testimony Friday todetermine what damages Ms. Ruston should receive.   Ms. Ruston had sought damages of $3 million in her suit. Thoughbarred from discussing the settlement, Ms. Ruston's attorney,Thomas DeCaro said, ``We're happy with the result.''   Two days before the jury verdict here, Audi was cleared by anOhio jury in the 1986 death of a 6-year-old Canton boy who waskilled when his mother's Audi lunged forward while she shiftedgears, pinning him between the car and a garage door. The boy'sparents had sued for $48 million.</TEXT></DOC>
