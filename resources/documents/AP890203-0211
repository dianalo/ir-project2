North would havefallen on his sword for President Reagan more than two years ago ifit weren't for the prospect of the Iran-Contra indictment whichfinally has gone to trial in U.S. District Court.   Now, North and his attorneys have made clear that none of hisformer superiors is immune from their strategy for beating acriminal rap in Reagan's worst scandal. Reagan himself may be calledto the dock; only President Bush has been excused, so far, by JudgeGerhard Gesell.   After exhaustive investigations by a presidential commission andthe Congress, it remains to be seen whether North's trial, expectedto last five months, will produce any startling new revelationsabout the bizarre sale of weapons to Iran and the transfer ofprofits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But North, armed with reams of previously undisclosed documents,has vowed a ``fight to the end'' to prove that his actions in thecase were authorized by others.   As far as Reagan and Bush are concerned, neither North nor otherIran-Contra defendants could produce in the previous investigationsany conclusive evidence to undermine the then-president and vicepresident's mutual disclaimer of any prior knowledge about thediversion of some of the Iranian arms money to the Contras, at atime when Congress forbade U.S. assistance to the rebels.   But North repeatedly told Congress he ``presumed'' Reagan knew,and that he had sent several memos up the line from his NationalSecurity Council desk. Others have wondered how Bush, who attendedmany meetings where the arms deal was discussed, could have been``out of the loop,'' as he has said.   North also told Congress that the Iran-Contra caper was fullysupported not only by his former immediate bosses, National SecurityAdvisers Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter, but then-CIA DirectorWilliam J. Casey, who died on May 7, 1987, a month before Northbroke his silence. Casey had acknowledged the CIA played a role inthe shipment of arms to Iran, but denied knowing anything about theContra end of the scheme.   ``I was not the only one who was enthusiastic about the idea,''said North in his Capitol Hill testimony. ``The director used manywords, all effusive.''   According to North, Casey looked upon the Iran-Contra operationas just the beginning of things to come. ``He had in mind anoverseas entity capable of conducting operations or activities inassistance of U.S. foreign-policy goals,'' North said.   In Casey's view, North said, it would be``stand-alone,self-financing and independent of appropriations.''   North said Casey and other top administration officials wantedNorth to ``take the hit'' if and when the scheme unraveled. And theformer Marine lieutenant colonel said he was prepared to do justthat _ to a point. ``I do honestly believe that they expected Olliewould go quietly,'' North testified. ``And Ollie intended to do so,right up until the day that somebody decided to start a criminalprosecution.''   It is a case which had its beginnings, not in the United Statesor Iran or Nicaragua, but in Lebanon. And that is where it blew upin the administration's face, when a pr-Syrian magazine firstreported, in early November of 1987, McFarlane's secret trip toTehran in 1985.
