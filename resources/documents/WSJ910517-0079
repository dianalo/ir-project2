The figures in the SEC filing were reflected in Citicorp'spreviously reported first-quarter net income of $70 million,or 10 cents a share, which represented an 81% drop from theyear-earlier net of $371 million, or $1.02 a share.   In its filing, Citicorp said it has put &quot;credit andcollection strategies&quot; in place to mitigate the recession'simpact, but said &quot;further increases&quot; in consumer loandelinquencies and credit losses could occur.   The delinquency rate on all mortgages that Citicorporiginated -- including those it has sold off in the form ofsecurities but still services -- is somewhat lower. Theoverall delinquency rate rose to 3.3% at March 31 from 2.7%at year end and 1.9% a year earlier.   Citicorp's SEC filing also provided additional details ofits loans to corporate buyouts and recapitalizations, knownas highly leveraged transactions or HLTs, and commercialreal-estate loans.   Citicorp's total loans to highly leveraged transactionsfell to $6.43 billion at March 31 from $7.18 billion at yearend and $8.62 billion a year earlier.

Nonperforming HLT loans outside the U.S. fellto $318 million at March 31 from $330 million at year end,but were much higher than the year-earlier amount of $86million.   In its filing, Citicorp warned that &quot;a continueddeterioration in business conditions may lead to an increase&quot;in nonperforming HLT loans and write-offs.   Citicorp's filing yesterday showed that the company'scommercial real-estate loans in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestregions continued to deteriorate sharply.
