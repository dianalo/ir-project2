In the latest incident in a widely publicized stock-trading scandal surrounding the Japanese real-estate concern, opposition politician Yanosuke Narazaki publicly declared that a Recruit Cosmos executive tried to give him five million yen (about $37,000) to not question the government too fiercely about the case in parliament.    Hiroshi Matsubara, director of the office of Recruit Cosmos's president, resigned Monday, the day Mr. Narazaki made his announcement. The company refused to comment further.    In July, the chairman of Recruit Co., parent of Recruit Cosmos, was forced to resign. It was disclosed that shares in Recruit Cosmos were sold to some secretaries of leading politicians and other influential buyers at low prices in 1984, before the stock was offered to the public.    Last week, the Ministry of Finance decided that Recruit Cosmos broke the law by failing to notify the ministry of the advance sale. But it said neither the buyers nor the company can be prosecuted because the statute of limitations in the case has expired. Japan, however, has begun to respond to criticism that its securities regulations are lax by initiating stiffer laws against insider trading.    Mr. Narazaki, a member of the United Social Democratic Party, is known to be a stern questioner in the Diet, or parliament, and was involved in unveiling cases of corruption in the government. The latest disclosure grabbed the nation's attention when a secret videotape of a meeting between Mr. Narazaki and Mr. Matsubara was aired on television Monday night.    The allegations were another major blow to both Recruit Cosmos and its parent, one of Japan's highest-flying service businesses before the scandal broke. But they also could slow the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plans to drive a controversial tax-reform proposal through parliament. Leaders of Japan's major opposition parties demanded yesterday that the government uncover the truth about the case before proceeding with debate about tax reform.    &quot;To do something like this at a time like this is clearly a violation of criminal law,&quot; said Shun Oide, chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee of the Japan Socialist Party.    The opposition parties demanded that the government set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate the Recruit case. Instead, the ruling and opposition parties agreed early this morning to give discussion of the Recruit case top priority within the broad agenda of a committee on the &quot;tax problem.&quot;    Mr. Narazaki said he will press formal bribery charges against Mr. Matsubara and other company executives within a week if Recruit doesn't release a list of people involved in the stock transaction. Justice Minister Yukio Hayashida said that if a formal complaint is made, public prosecutors will start an investigation.    The case also has become linked to the tax debate in the public mind. It sparked outrage as an unsavory example of the rich and powerful getting richer just as government leaders were trying to push through a consumption tax that would affect the spending power of the middle and lower classes.    When the Recruit Cosmos stock was listed, the share price rose sharply and early buyers reaped huge profits. Recruit Cosmos refused to officially release the list of 76 buyers, but among those who allegedly bought shares are aides to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and other senior politicians. Officials of private concerns and financial institutions also have been implicated.    The allegation of bribery only adds to the murkiness of the case. Mr. Narazaki said the Recruit Cosmos executive visited him several times since early August to ask him to help Recruit, offering a gift of sweets and five million yen in cash. Mr. Narazaki said he accepted the sweets but not the money. Before the latest visit of the company executive, Mr. Narazaki arranged to have a major television station, Nippon Television Network, secretly videotape the meeting. The tape shows the two men sharing tea and conversation in which Mr. Matsubara says, &quot;I didn't mean to offer you money. It was purely meant to be a souvenir.&quot;    As a result, Mr. Matsubara said he was &quot;tricked.&quot; He said he was first invited by Mr. Narazaki to discuss the case. Mr. Matsubara hasn't publicly denied the allegation of bribery. </TEXT></DOC>
