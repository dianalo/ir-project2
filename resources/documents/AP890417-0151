SUMMARY OF FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS</HEAD><TEXT>   The facts discovered during the Preliminary Inquiry demonstratethat Wright has violated, at times repeatedly (Special OutsideCounsel believes that Wright committed 116 violations of HouseRules), House Rule XLIII, clauses 1 (conduct reflectingdiscreditably on the House) and 4 (accepting improper gifts); HouseRule XLIV (failing to disclose income and gifts); House Rule XLVII,clause 1 (exceeding the limit on outside earned income); Code ofEthics for Government Service, consideration 5 (receiving favorswhich may influence performance of government duties); and 2 U.S.C.441i (retaining excessive honoraria). These violations occurredover the period from 1978 through 1988 during which Wrightcommitted the following acts:   _In 1979, Wright accepted an interest in a successful naturalgas well from Texas oilman, the late Monty Moncrief, which was anunreported gift worth approximately $82,000-$90,000.   _From 1984 through 1987, Wright received approximately $54,600in unreported gifts, honoraria, and other outside income fromlobbyists and special interest groups styled as ``royalties'' fromthe sale of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''   _From time to time from 1978 through 1988, Wright receivedapproximately $150,000 in unreported gifts from Texas real estatedeveloper, George Mallick, in the form of reduced interest on aloan; procurement of a loan; salary paid to Betty Wright for worknot performed; free and below-market value housing in Fort Worth;and the use of a 1979 Cadillac Seville in Washington, D.C.   _In 1986 and 1987, Wright improperly used his position in theHouse leadership to exercise undue influence on the actions takenby the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to control the burgeoningsavings and loan crisis in Texas and elsewhere.   The following is a summary of facts discovered and conclusionsreached by Special Outside Counsel on each of the six areas ofinquiry set forth in the Committee's Resolution. A detailedexposition of the Preliminary Inquiry is provided beginning on page25 of this Report.</TEXT><HEAD>A. Wright's Gas Well Investments With the Moncrief Family</HEAD><TEXT>   Beginning in late 1978, Wright intervened with the StateDepatment and the Egyptian government on behalf of the Neptune OilCompany in order to secure for Neptune an opportunity to resolve adispute with Egypt over the right to explore, develop and operateoffshore oil fields in the Gulf of Suez. Neptune had a contractwith the State of Israel to explore and develop theIsraeli-occupied territory. However, as a result of the Camp Davidaccords in September 1978 and the subsequent peace treatynegotiations, Israel was required to return the occupied Sinai andGulf of Suez territory to Egypt, relinquishing all rights to theoil fields without compensation. Egypt would not recognizeNeptune's rights under the Israeli contract. Thus Neptune stood tolose its investment and expected profit from the operation of theoil fields.   Wright introduced Richard Moncrief and other Neptune principalsto State Department officials, contacted Secretary of State CyrusVance and Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf Ghorbal, and personallydelivered a letter to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat while he wasin Washington. Wright's intervention on behalf of Neptune Oil doesnot in itself appear to have violated any law or ethical standard.   However, the facts of certain investment opportunities providedto Wright by the Moncrief family at the same time he wasintervening for Neptune demonstrate that Wright improperly receiveda gift valued at more than $100 from Monty Moncrief, a person witha direct interest in legislation before Congress. We were unable toestablish with the required certainty that the gift wascompensation for Wright's intercession on behalf of Neptune Oil.   Wright accepted the opportunity to purchase part of the Moncrieffamily interest in two east-Texas gas wells from Monty Moncrief,the late patriarch of the Moncrief family who was for many yearsactive in Washington, D.C. as a lobbyist for the IndependentPetroleum Association. The first opportunity, the Whatley well,appears to have been an ordinary, personal business transaction.For example, Wright received a written offer to participate indrilling the well; accepted the offer by written commitment to payhis share of all drilling costs; obtained financing to pay for hisdrilling costs; and actually paid those costs all prior to the timegas was discovered in the well on July 11, 1979. Put another way,he risked the amount of the drilling costs against the chance thatthe well would be dry. Had the well been dry, the investment wouldhave been lost.   Once gas was discovered in the Whatley well, although it wascommercially productive, it was clear that it would not be theinvestment predicted by the Moncriefs. Production and, therefore,profit from the well, if any, would be substantially less than hadbeen anticipated.   In contrast, in Wright's second investment opportunity, the L.D. Williams No. 1 well, Wright made no written commitment to paydrilling costs and did not obtain financing or pay for any costsuntil October 1979, long after gas was discovered in that well onJune 27, 1979. Thus unlike the Whatley investment, Wright investedin Williams No. 1 already knowing that it was a commerciallysuccessful well. The risk of losing his investment, which madeWhatley an ordinary business transaction, was absent in WilliamsNo. 1. Thus Wright received a gift worth aproximately$82,000-$90,000, the difference between the drilling costs and theincreased value of the well after gas was discovered. Wright failedto disclose his receipt of this gift on his Financial DisclosureStatement for 1979.   Wright also deferred paying two Moncrief invoices for WilliamsNo. 1 drilling costs without paying interest on the unpaid balance.One invoice for $8,668.21 remained unpaid from October 19, 1979until September 4, 1980. A second invoice for $7,703.64 remainedunpaid from April 18, 1980 until July 1, 1980. Although it appearsthat Wright may have received interest-free loans from MontyMoncrief for $8,688.21 for 10 months and $7,703.64 for two months _gifts worth nearly $1,200 _ it is impossible to determine whetherMoncrief's failures to collect the overdue balances were intendedas gifts, or were merely bookkeeping oversights. Thus we cannotconclude with the required certainty that Moncrief's failures tocollect interest were gifts to Wright.   In 1984, at a time when the Whatley well was ``shut in'' i.e.,had temporarily ceased production, Wright asked Monty Moncrief tobuy back his interest in the well. Wright was receiving no incomefrom the well and consequently he made no payments on his loan fromContinental National Bank. The bank's chairman stated that underthose circumstances he would have required other arrangements forrepayment of the nearly $20,000 outstanding balance.   Monty Moncrief agreed to buy back the Whatley interest for$20,000. While Moncrief's repurchase of Wright's interest in theWhatley well appears to have been a favor to Wright, it alsoappears to have been purchased at about the market value of theinterest. Therefore, there was no gift to Wright.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
