Establishment of the programis pursuant to section 206d of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act(AHERA) of October 1986.

Laboratories whose applications are received after that date willbe considered on a when-received basis.

Establishment of this program is pursuant to the requirements of Pub.L. 99-519, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) of October1986, for: (1) Inspection of schools for asbestos containing materials,(2) air monitoring following asbestos abatements, and (3) accreditationof laboratories that perform analysis of bulk and/or airborne materialsfor asbestos content. A <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (52 FR 39977-39978) October 26, 1987 announcedestablishment of an accreditation program for laboratories that performbulk and airborne analysis of asbestos. A <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice (53 FR 53048-53049) announced a PublicWorkshop which was held on March 28, 1989 at which the technical criteriaand procedures for the airborne asbestos program were presented and reviewed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Bulk Asbestos Testing </ITAG>NIST accredits laboratories that meet NVLAP criteria for determining theasbestos content of building materials by polarized light microscopy (PLM).<ITAG tagnum="84">Airborne Asbestos Testing </ITAG>NVLAP will accredit laboratories which demonstrate their competence toperform airborne asbestos testing in accordance with protocols specifiedby EPA. Competence will be determined through quality assurance (proficiency)testing and on-site laboratory assessments performed by technical experts.Laboratories must meet all NVLAP criteria and requirements in order tobecome accredited. NIST accreditation will be granted to laboratories that meet NVLAP criteriafor measuring asbestos in airborne particulate samples, from post-abatementclearance testing, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Quality assurance(proficiency) testing will require demonstrated laboratory competence fordetection at or near ambient levels of asbestos. However, levels may behigher in some cases to simulate ambient levels where abatement is incomplete(approximately 0.04 fibers per cubic centimeter). <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Requirements for the Accreditation Process </ITAG>Specific requirements and criteria address quality systems, staff, facilitiesand equipment, calibrations, test methods and procedures, manuals, records,and test reports. Laboratory competence will be determined through: (1)On-site assessments (systems audit) of the laboratory by peer assessors,(2) evaluation of analysts background, competence, and experience, (3)review of the technical documentation, and (4) quality assurance (proficiency)testing through analysis of representative samples containing asbestiformand non-asbestiform fibers in accordance with designated procedures. Laboratories which apply for accreditation and pay all necessary fees willbe required to meet proficiency testing (quality assurance testing) requirementsand on-site assessment requirements before initial accreditation and willbe required to meet on-going proficiency testing requirements and periodicreassessments to retain accreditation.<ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond G.
