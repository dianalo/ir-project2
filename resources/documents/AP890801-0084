Ten people were plucked by Coast Guard helicopter from twosinking shrimp boats in the Gulf of Mexico, and a pump was flownthrough the storm to a fishing boat taking on water 50 miles offGalveston, the Coast Guard said.   On Monday, one man was lost from an oil rig off Grand Isle, La.,as the storm moved in.   Chantal ripped off roofs, toppled power lines and sent barrelsrolling down streets after moving ashore about 8:15 a.m. near HighIsland, midway between Galveston and Port Arthur, with winds thatjust barely qualified as a hurricane.   The hurricane weakened inland and was downgraded to a tropicalstorm at 10:45 a.m., when the top wind speed dropped to 75 mph. At11 a.m., Chantal was centered 25 miles northeast of Houston, movingnorthwest at about 12 mph.   ``We had heavy rain with real hard wind. It's doing a lot ofwind damage,'' said Robert Isaacks, an emergency medical technicianon High Island.   Tornadoes were likely in Louisiana and Texas, and at least onepossible twister was spotted, forecasters said.   The Coast Guard rescued seven people from a sinking shrimp boatnear the Sabine Pass station, said station chief Kenneth Compton.``It was amazing. Flying in 60-knot winds they hoisted five peopleon one (helicopter),'' Compton said. ``Another helo searched thearea and they found the other two.''   Three people were rescued from another shrimp boat in the Gulf,the Coast Guard said.   Ten oil workers were missing off Morgan City, La., after theirrig capsized while heading inland Monday to escape the storm.Swells up to 25 feet forced the Coast Guard to call off the searchMonday afternoon. Four other workers from the rig were rescued.   Coastal Louisiana and Texas received 5 inches or more of rainMonday and could receive 10 to 15 inches in the next two days, theNational Weather Service said. Tides along the upper Texas coastwere at 10 feet above normal in places.   At Galveston, 1,000 people were evacuated from an area of thecity unprotected by a seawall. But many coastal residents waitedout the storm.   ``We get worse thunderstorms than this,'' said Betty Barrow, a28-year resident who remained on High Island. ``People are alwayscasual about these things here. The old-timers don't worry aboutthese things; they just stay.''   Chantal knocked out power on High Island shortly after 7 a.m.,but the few businesses in town remained open, including a grocerywhere Ms. Barrow was on duty. She said the storm has been good forbusiness as residents stock up on canned goods, bottled water andbatteries.   Some residents who waited overnight expecting a later landfallwere chased by wind and rising water from their homes on BolivarPeninsula, which separates Galveston Bay from the Gulf. High Islandis a town just north of the peninsula.   Dorothy Wells and her husband, Bubby, left about 5 a.m. andtraveled inland to Winnie, where they had breakfast and waited fora room at a motel.   ``We boarded up. My husband says we're not taking it down untilSeptember,'' Mrs. Wells said of their home, about 400 feet off thebeach.   As Chantal churned across the Gulf, Tropical Storm Dean swirledto life over the Atlantic late Monday. Dean had top sustained windsof 50 mph and was centered about 775 miles east of the LesserAntilles, moving west at about 17 mph.   Port Arthur Mayor Malcolm Grant asked the 800 residents ofSabine Pass to evacuate the coastal community just west of theLouisiana line, citing the likelihood of high water closing theonly highway between the town and Port Arthur.   Evacuation centers were set up in schools in Port Arthur and inBeaumont.   In Orange, just north of Port Arthur, government offices wereclosed and emergency centers set up. Crews handed out sandbags inlow-lying areas.   More than 600 offshore oil workers were brought inland.   Forecasters said the risk of flooding was high because theground remained saturated from Tropical Storm Allison, whichbrought heavy rain in late June.   ``If they tell us to get out, we get out,'' said Lutie Dyson,62, who with her husband and about 65 others took shelter in aschool in Lake Charles, La.   They were among about 8,500 Cameron Parish residents whoevacuated low-lying areas by Monday night. And 2,500 residents leftGrand Isle, 70 miles south of New Orleans, for fear the only roadto the island community might flood.   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.</TEXT></DOC>
