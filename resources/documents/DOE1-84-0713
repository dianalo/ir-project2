Presumably we must pay the price of what theyimport through some corresponding increase in what we export. Given increasingdepletion, we face the prospect of a growing drain upon our productivecapabilities to pay for imported oil. In that sense the problem is simplythe threat of impoverishment. At least in the short run, that threatis equivocal inasmuch as those from whom they import do not use theirearnings to procure corresponding quantities of goods and services fromus. Already surfeit, they have in good part allowed unused claims uponour production to accumulate in funds or securities, thereby introducingconsiderable uncertainties into the system of international trade. Meantime,the oil we import has de facto been a kind of loan. If we have been impoverished,it is not because the product of our labors has been siphoned off tobe consumed by others, but because of the way that we have respondedto the new circumstances. Coping with the realities of depletion doesraise important questions for policy, which the author discusses.</TEXT></DOC>
