In a report on the eight years since AIDS was first reported,the national Centers for Disease Control said the rate of increasein the number of documented AIDS cases ``has steadily declined,''for the most part.   In the CDC's latest monthly count, the nation has reported90,990 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 52,435 ofthose patients, or 58 percent, have died.   The number of AIDS cases, as compared to the year before, shotup 215 percent from 1982 to 1983. Since then, the increase hasslowed, for the most part: up 117 percent in 1984, 84 percent in1985, 60 percent in 1986, 60 percent again in 1987 and 34 percentlast year, when 32,311 cases were reported, said Dr. JeannetteStehr-Green, chief of the CDC's AIDS reporting and analysis section.   The 60 percent increase for 1987, which remained unchanged fromthe year before, came at a time when the medical definition of AIDSwas changed, resulting in more cases being reported.   ``The numbers are still increasing, but they're not increasingas rapidly,'' Stehr-Green said. ``It's important for people torealize the number of cases is still increasing and ... theincreases in certain populations are still very significant.''   Blacks and Hispanics, the CDC noted, ``continue to bedisproportionately represented among AIDS patients.''   Blacks make up 27 percent of all reported cases; Hispanicsaccount for 15 percent. The U.S. population is about 12 percentblack and about 6 percent Hispanic.   While the overall increase in AIDS has slowed, the geographicfocus of the disease has moved; only 32 percent of the nation'sAIDS cases in 1988 were reported from New York, New Jersey andPennsylvania, compared to 54 percent four years earlier.   ``It's moving outside of the major metropolitan areas, andoutside the Northeast,'' Stehr-Green said, noting that theproportion of cases in urban areas under 500,000 populationincreased from 12 percent in pre-1986 years to 19 percent in 1988.   Still, ``AIDS incidence is highest in the most populousmetropolitan ares in the United States,'' the CDC said in itsweekly report. Metro areas with more than a million people comprise41 percent of the nation's population, but account for 75 percentof its AIDS cases. The New York City area has reported the largestnumber of AIDS cases, 18,860.   As has been the case since the epidemic's earliest days, mostAIDS patients are male _ 91 percent of the adult or adolescentcases reported. And the vast majority of all patients still arehomosexual or bisexual males, 60 percent; intravenous drug abusers,20 percent; or both, 7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
