He appealed to the United States and the Soviet Union to helpend the region's civil wars.   Five Central American presidents will begin a two-day summitSunday, trying to rescue their shredded regional peace plan to endarmed conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador.   Arias did not mention the United States and Soviet Union byname, but spoke of ``superpowers in and out of the Americancontinent that are two-faced, talking about political solutionswhile they encourage military offensives.''   Diplomats expressed doubt the summit would get the peace processback on track.   ``Only a miracle would produce an agreement,'' said a CentralAmerican diplomat who helped arrange the meeting. ``I do not see asolution to the political crisis.''   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo said Saturday, ``We aregoing through a very difficult moment. We are not very optimistic,but it is a question of being willing to do something about it.''   Arias said the recent offensive by leftist rebels in El Salvador``eliminated whatever political space had opened there for theopposition .... There is a polarization there that will be verydifficult to eliminate.''   The summit, the latest in a series of gatherings aimed atworking out a regional peace, had been scheduled for Nicaragua.   It was moved from Managua to San Jose after Salvadoran PresidentAlfredo Cristiani suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua,accusing it of supplying surface-to-air missiles to the Salvadoranrebels.   A summit conference Aug. 7 in Tela, Honduras, resulted in asurge of optimism as Nicaragua agreed to hold elections, theSalvadorans agreed to talk to their guerrilla opponents, and allfive presidents agreed that U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas shouldbe demobilized by Dec. 5.   But hopes fell in the last six weeks. Fighting surged insideNicaragua as Contra rebels mounted attacks and President DanielOrtega declared an end to a 19-month cease-fire.   In El Salvador, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontguerrillas launched their biggest attack of the war.   The deadline for Contra demobilization passed with the Contrasstill in their camps in Honduras and Nicaragua's Sandinista Armymassing along the border.   The fifth president to attend the summit is Jose Azcona Hoyo ofHonduras.   An important actor in the Central American drama _ the UnitedStates _ does not attend the regional meetings but does try toinfluence decisions.   The United States supports Cristiani's government economicallyand militarily and provides non-lethal support to the Nicaraguanrebels.   Honduran president-elect Rafael Callejas, who takes office Jan.27, has said that his nation, like Guatemala and Costa Rica, needspeace to attract investment and spur an economic recovery. Therehas been virtually no new foreign investment in his nation in years.   Nicaragua wants the Contras _ those inside Nicaragua and thoseliving and training on the Honduran side of the border _ disarmedand disbanded. The government has offered an amnesty program.   But Contra military leaders, with U.S. backing, want to keeptheir groups together as a viable force until after Feb. 25elections are held in Nicaragua to keep pressure on the Sandinistasto hold a fair vote.   The slowly evolving regional peace plan produced a cease-fire inNicaragua in March 1988, brought about talks between Salvador'sguerrillas and government and produced the program fordemobilization of Contra groups by Dec. 5.   Ortega was expected to arrive early Sunday just moments beforethe opening of the meeting. He said he would discuss thedemobilization of the Contras and his government was willing toextend the deadline until Dec. 31.</TEXT></DOC>
