The ocean ship company said Farrell Lines Inc. and Lykes Bros. Steamship Co. withdrew from a transaction that would have garnered as much as $48 million a year in subsidies for Sea-Land's parent, CSX Corp., based here.    The arrangement, announced last July, had created a ship company, Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Shipping Corp., which agreed to acquire closely held Farrell, a small subsidized U.S. carrier, and to obtain some subsidy rights from closely held Lykes. Sea-Land, which isn't entitled to U.S. operating subsidies on its own, had hoped to lease 24 of its largest vessels to Aandamp;P Shipping. The new company was then to lease back the ships to Sea-Land at lower charter rates reflecting subsidy rights transferred from Farrell and Lykes.    The withdrawal of Farrell and Lykes &quot;is a major setback,&quot; said Paul Richardson, president of Aandamp;P Shipping. Officials of Sea-Land, Farrell and Lykes didn't elaborate. The plan was also set back last August when Waterman Marine Corp., another subsidized ship company that had agreed to be acquired by Aandamp;P Shipping, withdrew from the plan. </TEXT></DOC>
