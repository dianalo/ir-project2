<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0472 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new approach for VLSI precision X-Y position particle detectors is presented.They consist of individual detecting lines whose density matches theposition resolution along each line. It is shown that for independentdetector lines the total count rate of such a detector depends on themeasuring time resolution only, and not on the signal propagation speed.This suggests high spatial resolution VLSI detector arrays of such lines,where the high density of lines is set inversely proportional to theslow signal speed along each line. The working parameters are explicitlyformulated for such an optimized device, indicating for a 1 ns time resolutionan ideal signal speed of 10{sup 3} m/s for a 1 {mu}m resolution and integrationlevel. Hot spot propagation in superconducting small wires driven bya large current is proposed as an illustration of a 10 {times} 10 cm{sup2} X-Y detector with 1 {mu}m resolution at a high flux (10{sup 7} No./cm{sup2}-s). Here the hot spot nucleation is triggered by a particle detectionevent and its propagation is discussed in terms of the current drive,where the entire device can be considered as a low temperature calorimeterprobing extremely small volumes. The feasibility of this detector isevaluated for thermal and transport properties of various superconductors,among which NbN is shown to be suitable. In addition, this particulardetector type will solve the so-called N{sup 2} problem. A practicaldesign is also presented. 9 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
