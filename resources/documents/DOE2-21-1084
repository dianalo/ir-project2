These include the 4.8, 5.4 and 6.1 eV features noted previouslyin earlier damage studies. In the case of the ion implants additionalbands are formed. The region contains features at 5.9, 6.3, 6.4, 6.8and 6.97 eV which are resolvable at various stages of the growth curves.The 6.3 eV band is enhanced in parallel with the 4.8 and 5.4 eV transitions.All three bands are ascribed to the F/sup +/ centre. Models for the higherenergy bands are proposed based on complex defects of the oxygen sublatticeformed in the high damage density cascade caused by heavy ion implants.In particular, the 6.8 eV band dominates the spectrum after A/sup +/implants. Differences in absorption band strengths are noted for implantationin crystals of different orientation.</TEXT></DOC>
