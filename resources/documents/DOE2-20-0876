Itsspeed is two orders of magnitude faster than conventional nodal codes,attained by eliminating inner interactions in solving diffusion equations.The paper presents a comparison between SUPERNOVA and a standard designnodal code applied to a typical Westinghouse two-loop core. The powerdistribution predictions are in excellent agreement. There is also thepotential advantage of collapsing the three-dimensional corewise Green'sfunctional matrix to two-dimensional and one-dimensional, so that a singlecode and library provides consistent variable dimensional calculationssimultaneously. SUPERNOVA is being incorporated in an on-line core monitoringsystem for PWR cores. The extraordinary speed of this method and itsaccuracy will provide an extremely powerful system, operating on a workstation and allowing for very frequent power updates.</TEXT></DOC>
