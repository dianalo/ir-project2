Moments before, she had gazed out from the Center Block and sawpeople leaving a bus.   ``Sort of walking, running in a crouched position,'' she toldreporters later. ``People were escorting them in a crouchedposition like you see in war movies.''   When she walked out of the building, she saw men lying prone onthe ground, men in street clothes with guns drawn.   And then Bill Blaikie, a burly member of Parliament fromWinnipeg, was yelling at her to get out of there before she was hitby a bullet.   It was no movie.   A gunman had hostages in a bus on the Parliament Hill lawn andshots already had been fired.   Nicholas, a columnist for the Ottawa Citizen, and thepoliticians, staff and visitors in the gothic Parliament Buildingswere in a combat zone.   ``It was one of those things where somebody shouts, `There havebeen shots!' and I thought, `My God, I heard that.'''   Her reaction was common among the people working in theParliament Buildings who were soon told of the hostage-takingoutside.   Many had taken no notice of the shots they heard.   ``I heard a gunshot and that made me look out,'' said areceptionist in the office of Sen. Stanley Haidasz. ``You know, youhear all the noise all the time and you don't pay much attention.But it sounded peculiar.''   The receptionist refused to give her name.   Police hurried visitors and some employees out of the building.They told many employees not to leave the Parliament Buildings andto stay away from windows as the area was being cordoned off.   ``One of our security men just came in and asked us to leave andhe said: `Because he has fired another shot. We've got to get outof here,''' said Terry Kealey, a staff member in Grains MinisterCharlie Mayer's office, in a phone interview.   About two hours later, the employees were ushered out bysecurity guards.   Those in the main building were led through a tunnel to a nearbybuilding, then escorted out amid the hundreds of spectators who hadgathered on nearby sidewalks.   Parliament members sitting in the Commons were informed by thesergeant-at-arms about the gunman. They left when the building wascleared.   Blaikie, a New Democrat member of Parliament, said he wasstanding on the front step of the Parliament Buildings waiting fora cab when he noticed a police cruiser drive across the lawn.   Moments later, officers motioned to people to get down, Blaikiesaid, and he ``decided maybe it was time to get out of there.''</TEXT></DOC>
