Many countries,particularly developing ones, find it impossible to implement their nuclearpower programs without technical cooperation and assistance from advancedcountries. In this Asia and Pacific Region, seven countries have commercialnuclear power units in operation and/or under construction. Korea hassix nuclear power units in operation, and three under construction. Activenuclear cooperation has been instrumental in implementing her abmitiousnuclear power programs successfully. Nuclear cooperation is one of thewidely recognized necessities, which is quite often talked about amongthe countries of the Asia and Pacific Region. But the differences innuclear maturity and national interests among those in the region seemto be standing against it. Given the constraints, it is not easy to selectappropriate areas for cooperation. There is no doubt, however, that theyshould include the nuclear policy, nuclear safety, radwaste management,radiological protection, and the management of nuclear units. In orderto effectively promote nuclear cooperation in the Region, the scope ofRCA activities must be expanded to include the nuclear power area. TheRegional Nuclear Data Bank, the Regional Training Center and the NuclearEmergency Response Center, for example, would be the effective toolsfor cooperation to meet the demands of the countries in the Region. Inview of the technological gap between Japan and all others in the region,we cannot speak of a regional nuclear cooperation without heavily countingon Japan, the most advanced nuclear state in the region. For these reasons,Japan is expected to share an increasing portion of her nuclear technologywith others.</TEXT></DOC>
