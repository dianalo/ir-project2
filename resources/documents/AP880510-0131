Carton, 64, was protocol officer at the French Embassy in Beirutwhen he was kidnapped March 22, 1985 by pro-Iranian extremists. Hewas freed May 4 along with French diplomat Marcel Fontaine, 45, andFrench journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44.   Peggy Say, of Batavia, N.Y., has been waging a campaign to keepthe hostage issue in the public eye as part of an effort to win therelease of her brother, the longest-held hostage in Lebanon.   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.   Mrs. Say met on Monday with Fontaine and hoped to see Kauffmannon Wednesday.   ``My feelings are mixed because it is always difficult,especially hearing the stories of how the French were brutalized,''she said. ``But on the other hand, Terry is alive and it hasreinforced my determination to work toward his release.   ``I know I am doing what he is counting on me to do.''   Carton said he felt well, but that his condition was weak and hestill has trouble walking. He met with Mrs. Say in the garden ofthe home of his daughter in this Geneva suburb.   ``I was encouraged that he seemed in reasonably good health,''Mrs. Say said. ``He was very concerned about the hostages leftbehind, so we agreed that our conversation be kept absolutelyprivate.''   Referring to her talks with Carton and other members of hisfamily, she said:   ``He, like Fontaine, was adamant that public pressure to get theU.S. administration to work for the hostages' release was the onlyway that they would ever gain freedom _ that their cause must bekept in the public eye, that by keeping the issue alive, we arekeeping the hostages alive.''   There are 18 hostages in Lebanon, including eight otherAmericans in addition to Anderson.</TEXT></DOC>
