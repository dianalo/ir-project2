SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When it comes to clothing, it turns out thatsingle men buy more than single women.   But they're buying a lot of it for the women, not themselves,researchers have found.   Men also spend more than women on eating out, entertainment,alcoholic beverages, tobacco and cars.   Single women, on the other hand, spend more of their income onhousing, food eaten at home, health care and reading material.   Those are among the findings reported in the April edition ofAmerican Demographics magazine.   While the study of spending by single people reported that themales spend more on clothing _ on average _ the difference restsentirely with men aged 55 to 64.   ``Men aged 55 to 64 spent $1,128 a year on apparel and servicesin 1984-85, compared with the $682 a year spent by the women inthat group,'' reported Stephanie Shipp.   ``Much of that difference can be accounted for by men'spurchasing of apparel as gifts. Almost 25 percent of the apparelbudget of men goes toward gifts, compared with 14 percent of theapparel budget of women,'' she wrote.   ``More than half of the men's apparel gift purchases are forjewelry and watches _ and women are the likely recipients of manyof those gifts,'' reported Shipp.   Women outspent men on apparel in all other age groups, but theone deviation was enough to pull average clothing spending for allsingle men above that of single women, $735 to $657, she found.   Shipp heads the analysis branch of the Bureau of LaborStatistics' division of consumer expenditure surveys. Her report isbased on a study of spending by singles in 1984 and 1985. AmericanDemographics, published by Dow Jones andamp; Company, concentrates onpopulation and marketing.   While women have made gains in recent years they continue totrail men in income at all age groups, Shipp noted.   Thus, while women may spend less than men on some items, thatmoney may still represent a larger share of their resources thanfor males.   Single men are more likely to be younger, under age 35, whilesingle women were more often aged 55 and over, she found.   Single women were more likely to own their own home, 41 percent,compared to 29 percent of men, likely reflecting their older age asa group.   Single men were found to devote 20 percent of their money tocars, car repairs and other transportation costs, while women spent17 percent of their income on transport.   After age 55, however, women tended to spend slightly more thanmen on new cars and trucks, Shipp discovered.   Single women spent twice as much as men on health care, and thatwas not just because they tended to be older. Younger women alsospend more on health than men in their age group.   At every age group men outspent women on entertainment,``perhaps because it is still the custom that men pay for dates,''Shipp said.</TEXT></DOC>
