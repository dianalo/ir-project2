But market participants were few, and many traders view the dollar's outlook as limited for moves in either direction.    &quot;This is an absolutely lackluster market, and people aren't that interested,&quot; Axel Coym, vice president and chief trader at Westpac Banking Corp., New York, said. &quot;There are no great expectations on the upside, and there are no great expectations on the downside.&quot;    The dollar made its strongest move against the Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 150.63 yen, a rise of 0.7% from 149.55 late Friday. Some traders attributed the rise to the flow of investment to the U.S. from Japan, which has resumed this summer after drying up earlier in the year.    &quot;There was good dollar-buying out of London and New York by Japanese. They're just trying to play catch-up,&quot; Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president and chief corporate dealer for Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said.    In other trading, the dollar firmed to 1.8554 West German marks from 1.8523, and the British pound slipped 0.5% to $1.5983 from $1.6060.    The dollar was quoted at 150.50 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    There was little reaction to yesterday's Commerce Department report that personal income in June increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from the previous month. The rise was greater than the 0.3% increase generally expected by private forecasters and was viewed as mildly inflationary.    Traders, however, were more inclined to take profits by selling the foreign currencies that had appreciated against the dollar last week.    &quot;Everyone is content with a few points here and a few points there,&quot; Mr. Coym said, and this will tend to restrict the dollar to a narrow range as dealers seek to take profits on the slightest moves.    Some traders blamed the sluggish market on seasonal factors. &quot;We're about to enter the real summer doldrums,&quot; James H. Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    As a result of the lack of activity in the market, dealers at one major New York bank were playing simulated golf on their personal computers, according to the head of foreign exchange there, who asked that he and the bank not be identified.    &quot;We're having a tournament Thursday night. We'll be playing at Pebble Beach, or on the Pebble Beach software,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 30 cents an ounce to $453.70 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $453.05 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                LATE NEW YORK TRADING                Monday, July 27, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
