Oneimmediate result is that Pan American World Airways, on the brink of shuttingdown, will continue to fly.;    By allowing United Airlines and AmericanAirlines to buy routes to Heathrow Airport near London, the pact also providesmuch-needed money to Trans World Airlines, which, while not in as dire shapeas Pan Am, has had huge losses.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PAN AM DEAL OK'D BY BRITAIN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Pan Am has agreed to sell its London routes to United for $290 million, andTWA has a similar deal with American for $440 million. Those sales can now gothrough.;    In the long haul, travelers will benefit, industry experts say.United and American, with their vast domestic route systems, will be able tooffer more convenient flights from U.S. cities to London.;    Besides gettingthe London routes, Pan Am and United will also forge a marketing partnershipthat, among other things, will join the frequent-flyer programs of the twocarriers and promote a transfer of passengers between the carriers. It hasbeen estimated that the marketing agreement would mean between $100 millionand $150 million in added revenues for Pan Am resulting from the additionalpassengers it will be able to attract.;    The agreement comes just in timefor Pan Am, which faced an immediate seizure of its fleet if it failed to paypast-due debts. &quot;Without this agreement,&quot; Secretary of Transportation SamuelK. Skinner said at a news conference in Washington, &quot;Pan Am would have goneout of business tomorrow.&quot;;    Analysts agree that Pan Am, which filed forbankruptcy protection Jan. 8, still spends at least a million dollars a daymore than it takes in. Long-term, they say, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskettmust continue his search for an agreement with a wealthy partner.;    Whilethe United States clearly gains from the accord, there are substantialbenefits for Britain. The British won rights that could be of great value whenthe European Community lowers regulatory barriers governing air travel withinEurope.;    The agreement could bring more competition to Heathrow and enablecarriers like British Airways to build up service from points in the UnitedStates to cities in Continental Europe.;    The agreement over the rights tofly into Heathrow was crucial to the sale since United would not have boughtthe routes without such rights.;    In return for being able to have twostrong carriers replace two ailing ones at Heathrow, the United States gaverights to Britain that could eventually greatly increase British Airwaysservice from the United States to the European Continent and to other foreigndestinations.;    In addition, British carriers will be given broader rightsover how their flights are displayed on the computer reservation systems ofAmerican carriers.;    The British also won the right to have a second Britishcarrier, most likely Virgin Atlantic, operate out of Heathrow to the UnitedStates. And British carriers won greater rights to operate flights that go tothe United States and then continue on to cities in Latin America, Canada, andAsia.;    Also, Britain will get four new opportunities to allow an additionalBritish airline to fly to American cities already served by one or two Britishcarriers.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910312  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  551  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 12, 199100072021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
