The trade association said sales in June fell to $13.1 billion from $13.53 billion in May and from a record $25.87 billion in April, when heavy buying for individual retirement accounts ahead of the April 15 federal tax deadline aided results.    June sales also were below the year-earlier monthly total of $15.5 billion.    Assets of mutual funds rose to a record $818.31 billion from $805.32 billion in May, fueled by both a drop in redemptions and capital appreciation from rises in stock and bond prices, according to Alfred P. Johnson, vice president and chief economist at the institute.    Net sales, or sales minus redemptions, rose to $5 billion from $3.9 billion. The institute said the drop in redemptions reflected a perception among investors that the bond market was stabilizing.    Bond and income funds continued to lead in sales with $8 billion, compared with $8.5 billion in May. Stock fund sales remained at $5.1 billion.    Government-income fund sales dropped to $2.7 billion from $3 billion in May. Sales of long-term municipal bond funds remained at $1.3 billion, and Government National Mortgage Association funds dropped to $705.9 million from $840.4 million.    The following monthly statistics, provided by the Investment Company Institute, are for mutual funds -- excluding money market funds and limited maturity municipal bond funds -- with dollar figures in millions:                             June '87     May '87    June '86 Sales of Fund Shares .... $13,103.9   $13,531.2   $15,518.5 Redemptions .............. $8,127.2    $9,666.3    $5,556.5 Cash andamp; S.T.
