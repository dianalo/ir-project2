Age data from the 1990 census show that Alaska, Idaho,Utah and Wyoming have the highest proportions of children.Alaska has the biggest share of children under age five, at10%, compared with a national average of 7%. Utah has thehighest proportions of school-age children: 15% of itspopulation is ages five to 11, and 11% is in the 12-to-17range, compared with U.S. shares of 10% and 8%, respectively.   Young adults ages 18 to 24 are most prevalent in urbanareas. The District of Columbia has 14% of its population inthis age group, vs. 11% for the nation. States where youngadults are concentrated include the Carolinas, Massachusettsand Rhode Island.   Alaska has the highest proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds,at 21%, compared with 17% nationally. The share of 35- to44-year-olds is also highest in Alaska, at 19%, vs. a 15%national average.   Middle-aged Americans are more evenly dispersed thanothers. Nevada has the biggest proportion, 11%, of those ages45 to 54, but that's only slightly higher than the 10%national average. The share of those ages 55 to 64 is highestin West Virginia, at 10%, compared with 8.5% for the nation.   Older people are the most geographically concentrated.Florida has the highest proportions of people in the 65-to-74and 75-and-up groups, at 11% and 8%, respectively. Thesecompare with national shares of 7% and 5%. Those ages 65 to74 also congregate in a variety of Northeastern and Southernstates, including Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island andWest Virginia. After Florida, the 75-and-up group is mostconcentrated in the Midwest, with above-average shares inIowa, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota.                                                                                                          More Divorces Involve   Fewer Children Apiece                                                                                                          CLOSE TO 2% of American children a year see their parentsdivorce.   That's up from fewer than 1% in the 1950s and 1960s. Inthose days of larger families, however, divorces involved anaverage of 1.3 children. Today, divorces involve an averageof just under one child.   According to divorce decrees and marriage annulments fromthe 32 states that provide information about childrenaffected by divorce, 47% of 1988 divorces involved nochildren under age 18. Twenty-six percent of divorcingcouples had one child under 18, 20% had two, 6% had three,and about 2% had four or more children.   The share of divorced couples with children doesn't varymuch by race. Fifty-two percent of white couples who divorcedin 1988 had children, compared with 50% of black couples and48% of those of other races.   But there are racial differences when parents' educationallevels are considered, according to decrees from the 19states that collect this information. White divorcing coupleswith less than a high school education are more likely tohave children than those with higher education, while blackdivorcing couples with college educations are more likely tohave children than those with less education.   Children are more likely to be involved in divorces inMidwestern and Western states, partly because those areashave higher fertility rates. In Oregon, 63% of divorcingcouples had children, compared with 35% in the District ofColumbia.                                                                                                          Decision Makers Cluster   In Metropolitan Areas                                                                                                          JOBS are migrating to large metropolitan areas, but moreso for bosses than workers, a study suggests.   Sociologists Annabel Kirschner Cook of Washington StateUniversity and Donald M. Beck of Battelle Pacific NorthwestLaboratories examined shifts in occupational employment from1979 to 1986.   Overall, the share of workers who lived in largemetropolitan areas rose to 51% in 1986 from 44% in 1979. Thisgain held true for all major occupational categories, but wasmost pronounced for managers and professionals, whose numbersin metro areas grew to 59% from 48%.   Other kinds of workers aren't as prevalent in largemetropolitan areas, nor have their numbers grown as much. Theproportion of service workers living in large metropolitanareas rose 6.5 percentage points during the study period, butonly 49% lived in large metros as of 1986. The share of largeurban dwellers among people in technical, sales, andadministrative support jobs rose to 55% from 49%.   Ms. Cook and Mr. Beck conclude that metropolitan Americais likely to become more dominant. At the same time, theysay, more managers than support workers and back-officeoperations have moved to or stayed in metro areas, sodecentralization in the form of separating the bosses fromthe workers may be a theme of the 1990s.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THREE out of four Americans who plan to take a vacationthis summer say &quot;being together as a family&quot; is a veryimportant reason to take a trip, according to the U.S. TravelData Center. The second most popular reason is &quot;getting awayfrom daily work routine,&quot; cited by 72%. . . . Fourteenpercent of Americans lack health insurance, according to theNational Center for Health Statistics' 1989 National HealthInterview Survey. Young people, men, nonwhites and those withlow incomes are less likely than average to have healthinsurance.</TEXT></DOC>
