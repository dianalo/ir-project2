The study has also dealtwith general principles of gas separation as well as equipment and processsolutions applied. Gas separation is advancing faster than any otherfield of membrane technology. It has gained foothold as an industrialmethod in quite a short time. At present, membrane separation of hydrogenis already a standard procedure and the method has also been extendedto enrichment of nitrogen and oxygen and to removal of carbon dioxide.So far, pilot and labortory tests have been carried out on other membraneapplications for gases. The present gas separation equipment can wellbe used to separate relativey small amounts of gas. In the treatmentof large amounts of gas conventional methods, such as the gryogenic methodbased on liquefaction of gas, are clearly the most economical.</TEXT></DOC>
