 And former researchers raced to bereapers.andP;  I watched many new companies form to build dedicated AI hardware orto create special-purpose expert systems on a contract basis.andM;In those days most AI entrepreneurs were out to build expensive, custom&quot;wedding cakes&quot; that only a few people would use.andP;  But my goal was to be inthe &quot;cookie business,&quot; manufacturing hundreds of thousands of copies of acommodity that would serve a broad range of commerce.andM;At that time, I was working in the artificial Intelligence Center of SRIInternational as director of the natural-language research program.andP;  Severalothers at the Center also had the entpreneurial bug, and in 1978 we foundedMachine Intelligence Corporation (MIC), a precursor to Symantec.andP;  We beganwork on a computer vision product and received a government grant to studythe feasibility of doing natural-language processing on personal computers.andO;But by 1982, MIC found its energies fragmented and its business focuswanting.andP;  The company eventually collapsed under the weight of too muchtechnology, too much investment, and too little appreciation of customers'real needs.andM;In the interim, however, Symantec was formed to exploit natural language inPC-based applications.andP;  As is common with high-tech startup companies, we hada technology in search of a market.andP;  Our first project attempted to couplenatural-language processing with a sophisticated semantic network database onPCs.andP;  It was a terrific research project, but it proved too difficult tobuild and too troublesome to use.andP;  It burned a lot of investment capital andnearly drove the company under.andM;In a fortuitous twist of events, Symantec merged with Candamp;E Software, giving usmuch-needed business talent as well as vital PC expertise.andP;  Following themerger, our greatest challenge was in building a bridge between our AI and PCexperts.andP;  Initially neither of these groups had much respect for the other,and acting alone neither could have produced Qandamp;A.andP;  But once these talentsmerged, they engendered a special kind of magic.andM;After our initial false start, we realized that the benefit our technologyoffered was ease of use, not English understanding per se.andP;  We learned thatQandamp;A must meet real customer needs, that while artificial intelligence couldgrab market attention, the product would have to be a database workhorse, notan AI curiosity.andP;  &quot;Easy access to power&quot; became our theme, and we hit uponthe idea of embedding our AI technology in a straightforward flat-filedatabase manager.andM;With the concept defined, the challenge was then to shoehorn natural-languageprocessing--which required 5MB of memory on a mainframe--into a PC.andP;  This wasno small task; remember that in 1984, the typical PC was a 512KB, 8088machine with a pair of floppy disk drives.andM;Also, there was--and is today--a tremendous challenge to marketing PC-basedartificial intelligence.andP;  To work effectively, an AI system must know a lotabout a customer's business.andP;  Users of mainframe AI systems, who typicallyspend a few hundred thousand dollars on a software package, expert to investhundreds of manhours customizing the package for their businesses.andP;  But PCusers expect an inexpensive product that demands little training,configuration , or customization.andP;  So we had to create mechanisms thatenabled Qandamp;A to acquire most of its knowledge about our customers' databasesautomatically.andP;  This we did.andM;When the product finally shipped in late 1985, we were too short of cash tobuy our way into the crowded market of database management systems.andP;  To getthe ball rolling, every person in the company--including the programmers andaccounting clerks--made sales calls at individual stores.andP;  This wasinvaluable for raising our awareness of customer needs.andP;  Along the way, weattracted our share of tire-kickers--people who bought Qandamp;A just to play withan AI system.andP;  But that kind of user does not a market make.andP;  Qandamp;A owes itssuccess to the fact that it effectively solves customer problems.andP;  In thatrespect, it's not different from the success of a conventional PC product.andM;That an AI application should effectively solve a real problem rather thansimply show off a technology has been a hard lesson for many in the AIindustry.andP;  AI folks tend to be a proud lot, perhaps because we know some ofthe secrets of knowing.andP;  But this special knowledge is useless withoutrespect for conventional computer science, for the PC hacker, and for theproblems and natural intelligence of customers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
