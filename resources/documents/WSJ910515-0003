By postponing any announcement, the 61-year-old centralbanker only added to the uncertainty at the Bundesbank, whichfunctions almost as a central bank for Europe, in effectsetting monetary policy for nations stretching from theMediterranean to Scandinavia. In Frankfurt, shares declinedfor the second day in a row, in part because of theuncertainty.</LP><TEXT>   Several sources said Mr. Poehl has indicated to a smallcircle of associates his intention to step down for personalreasons. But both he and the Bundesbank have refused toconfirm the talk.   A resignation to pursue private-sector opportunitieswouldn't necessarily jostle the Bundesbank's reputation as astalwart guardian of sound money. But the current speculationfollows a series of policy run-ins with the Bonn governmentand Germany's 16 federal states. A departure perceived as aresignation-in-protest could spawn doubts about theBundesbank's capacity to function as an anti-inflationaryanchor in Europe's various monetary arrangements.   Meanwhile, German financial executives widely predict thatBundesbank directorate member and former finance ministerHans Tietmeyer, responsible for international affairs, wouldbe the likely successor to Mr. Poehl, who has been thepresident for 11 years. Another board member, HelmutSchlesinger, was also mentioned often as a successor. Eitherway, Bonn officials insisted that basic hard money,anti-inflationary bank policies wouldn't change.</TEXT></DOC>
