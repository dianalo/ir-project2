In this study, among the research subjects concerningthe reduction of effective earthquake input, regarding the uplift offoundations, its response characteristics and the method of the rationalevaluation of earth contact ratio were experimentally examined, and themethod of analysis which can evaluate the damping effect due to the upliftwas proposed. The experimental method is reported. It was found thataccompanying the uplift of foundations, vertical motion was induced,and horizontal motion showed nonlinear response. It was confirmed thatthe nonlinear response accompanying the uplift can be approximately evaluatedby the conventional analysis technique using the S-R model. The currentequation for evaluating earth contact ratio is adequate for a soft groundmodel, and tends to undervaluate for a hard ground model. The S-R analysismodel introducing the experimentally obtained characteristics in thedampling coefficient of a nonlinear rocking spring was newly made. (Kako,I.).</TEXT></DOC>
