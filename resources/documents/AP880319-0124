The $200,000 spent to respond to the four-day Sandinista borderraid in late March 1986 was used to airlift Honduran troops to theremote jungle in southeastern Honduras where the Nicaraguan forceswere attacking Contra rebel camps, and to provide them with fieldrations, according to the General Accounting Office.   The remainder of the $20 million was used simply to speed up aschedule of routine purchases for the Honduran military, most ofthem aimed at modernizing the country's armed forces, the GAO found.   Some of the items purchased with the money had little to do withdefense of the country's Nicaraguan border. They included two LCM@8landing craft and related equipment for the Honduran navy, valuedat $1.36 million.   In contrast to the ``emergency'' status of the Reaganadministration's aid request, the money was spent over a period ofmonths, and some $3.3 million of the aid remained unspent a fullyear after it was authorized, the agency found.   And rather than drawing all of the aid from existing Pentagonstocks, as normal emergency procedures dictate, only $6 million inmateriel was taken directly from the Defense Department. The restof the money was used to buy items directly from contractors andother sources, GAO said.   Honduran officials and some in the State Department lateracknowledged that Honduras had to be pressured to complain aboutthe incursion, which occurred in a remote and relativelyunpopulated jungle, and to ask for U.S. aid. The Hondurans werereluctant to admit publicly that the Contras were using theirterritory as a staging area for attacks into Nicaragua.   The issue of how badly Honduras needed the military help twoyears ago has been revived after last week's deployment of 3,200U.S. troops on a training exercise in Honduras in response to asimilar Sandinista border incursion.   The wisdom of President Reagan's decision to send in Americanpersonnel has been sharply questioned in Congress, with somelawmakers accusing the administration of exaggerating theSandinista threat to generate sympathy for a new package of aid tothe Nicaraguan Contras.   On Friday, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams toldreporters that discussions were under way with Honduran PresidentJose Azcona about the possibility of providing additional U.S.assistance to his country.   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''Abrams said. He did not say whether those options included militaryfinancial aid, as in 1986, but did say the administration did notcontemplate sending additional troops. Abrams was instrumental inarranging the 1986 aid.   Sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified byname, said the government of Honduras asked the United States forhelp Friday in transporting troops to an area near the Nicaraguanborder where Honduran and Sandinista forces were fighting. Anadministration source said the request was likely to be approved.   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., disclosed existence of the GAO reportThursday at a hearing when he asked John C. Whitehead, the StateDepartment's No. 2 official, to explain the discrepancy between theseriousness with which the administration portrayed the 1986incursion and the minuscule amount of money spent to respond to it.   The Associated Press later obtained a summary of the findings ofthe still-classified report, dated Feb. 2 and prepared at therequest of Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.   ``How can we take seriously the administration's rhetoric onthis occasion?'' if Congress and the public were misled in similarcircumstances two years ago, Obey asked, according to a transcriptof the hearing before his Appropriations subcommittee on foreignoperations.   ``What I find so troubling is the parallelism with two years ago... If they were concerned in 1986, why did they only spend$200,000 of the $20 million to deal with the problem they said theyneeded it for?'' Obey asked Whitehead.   ``Because the incursion backed away,'' Whitehead responded.   ``Why didn't you return the money, then?'' Obey continued.   ``Fortunately, the money did not have to be spent on repellingan invasion because the invasion disappeared,'' Whitehead said.``We hope it will disappear again.''   Obey said he was not alleging that any of the money was usedillegally, but concluded: ``It appeared that that incursion wassimply used as an excuse to get $20 million in additional militaryaid to Honduras.''   ``I do not know, Mr. Chairman,'' Whitehead said. ``I have noreason to disagree with the GAO report.''   The GAO also found that Pentagon reports to Congress describingdelivery of the 1986 assistance ``contained numerousinconsistencies and inaccuracies.''   The administration has portrayed the latest border incursion bySandinista troops as a large, long-planned and well-executed attackthat jeopardized Contra supply centers inside Honduras and leftrebel casualties, much as the administration did in the 1986 raid.   Like the incursion of two years ago, this one came at a timewhen Congress was locked in controversy over whether to renew aidto the anti-Sandinista rebels. In both cases, the House had justvoted down an aid package and further congressional action loomedahead.   In both instances, the administration produced a written requestfrom Honduran President Azcona for U.S. support to repel theincursion, and in both cases diplomatic consultations involvingmilitary aid had taken place before the written request.   In 1986, the border battle proved indecisive and turned out torelatively unimportant in military terms. On Friday, SenateIntelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., said itappeared Sandinista troops were withdrawing from the area withouthaving achieved many of their objectives.   Reagan authorized the $20 million sent in 1986 under the ForeignAssistance Act, which allows the president to transfer up to $75million a year in unused Pentagon money for any ``unforeseenemergency ... which requires immediate military assistance to aforeign country.''   The aid was a substantial boost in military help for Honduras,which received $60 million that fiscal year in regular U.S.assistance. In fiscal 1988, the regular military aid level wasincreased to $80 million.   ``The administration declared it was an emergency'' Obey said ofthe 1986 incursion, noting the written aid request from Azcona,whom he said ``often appears not to sneeze without asking (U.S.Ambassador Everett) Briggs for a hanky.''</TEXT></DOC>
