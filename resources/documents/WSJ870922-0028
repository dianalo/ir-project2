The venture, one of the first partnerships between a small biotechnology company and a large food concern, indicates that plant gene-splicing technology is beginning to come of age. During the past few years, similar partnerships between biotechnology and large drug companies have become the primary route for bringing genetically engineered drugs to market.    Precise terms of the venture weren't disclosed, but BioTechnica said RJR Nabisco will provide most of its funding and will have a first option to license resulting products. The venture will operate as a partnership involving scientists with RJR Nabisco's Del Monte Corp. and Nabisco Inc. units and with BioTechnica and its 42%-owned Canadian affiliate, BioTechnica Canada, BioTechnica said.    The new venture will try to genetically engineer fruits, vegetables and other crops of interest to Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco that have better taste, longer shelf life and other desired properties, BioTechnica said. &quot;RJR Nabisco's venture with us shows that the technology has reached the point at which we can sit down and decide what changes to plants make the most sense,&quot; said Norman Jacobs, BioTechnica's president.    Mr. Jacobs declined to disclose details of the venture's proposed projects, but he said the &quot;kinds of things we might do&quot; include developing &quot;supersweet&quot; peas, seedless green peppers and fruits with enhanced or novel flavors, such as a pineapple with strawberry coloring and flavor. He added that the initial products from the partnership may be available in three to five years.    Biotechnology's agricultural payoffs have lagged behind its medical ones largely because splicing new genes into plants is far more difficult than genetically engineering bacteria, yeast and other microorganisms to produce drugs. However, scientists have learned that a certain strain of bacteria can transfer desired genes into plants such as tobacco, tomatoes and alfalfa. And in July, BioTechnica announced that it had developed a new technique that promises to enable the transfer of genes into a broader array of plants, including major crops such as corn and wheat.    BioTechnica's stock closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $4.75 a share, up 37.5 cents. RJR's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $62.875 a share, down $1.125. The venture was announced after the markets closed. </TEXT></DOC>
