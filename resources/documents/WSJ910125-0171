The plan has sparked debate reminiscent of the controversyin November that killed a government bill to allow Japanesesoldiers to provide noncombat support to the UnitedNations-supported coalition.</LP><TEXT>   Officials of the government and ruling Liberal DemocraticParty say they expect to gain the necessary support in theDiet, or parliament, to enact the aid plan, announcedThursday. But opposition parties have raised a range ofobjections, and the government will be pressured heavily tostipulate that the money not be used for weapons orammunition.   Failure to win approval for the $9 billion contribution --a possibility that a Foreign Ministry spokesman was unable torule out -- would cause a crisis in relations with the U.S.,which is counting on Japan shouldering a share of thefinancial burden for the war effort proportionate to Tokyo'sheavy reliance on Mideast oil. Shortly after Tokyo laid outits new pledge, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater calledit &quot;probably more generous than we had hoped for.&quot;   The government's new aid plan got off to a stumblingstart. Bickering among senior officials over elements of theproposal forced Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to cancel aWednesday news conference called to unveil the package.   When an outline of the plan was finally presented toreporters Thursday morning, a cabinet spokesman quickly fellinto the kind of word games that earned the governmentridicule during last year's debate over the ill-fated U.N.cooperation bill. To a Japanese reporter's suggestion thatthe latest contribution would amount to funding a war, thespokesman replied that, because the multinational forces arein the Mideast to restore peace, the money would actuallyrepresent peace-restoration funds.   While Japan did allocate $2 billion last year for theforces defending Saudi Arabia, the outbreak of warfarechanges the political equation here. Japan's constitution,drawn up by U.S. occupation officials after World War II,renounces war as a means of settling international conflicts.With U.S. approval, Japan found enough maneuvering room inthe constitution to build up a sizable military force -- butone that is legally restricted to defense.   The cabinet spokesman said the government will present asupplemental budget to the Diet for the fiscal year that endsMarch 31. Details of how to finance the expenditure haven'tbeen decided, but a cabinet spokesman indicated thegovernment may seek to issue short-term bonds, to be repaideventually through an increase in oil and other taxes.   A supplemental budget could be passed by the lower houseof the Diet, over upper house objections. But legislation toauthorize the raising of the money most likely will requireapproval of both houses, officials say. As the LDP lacks amajority in the upper house, the swing vote there belongs tothe moderate Komeito party.   Mr. Kaifu was quoted in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper assaying that he had &quot;received the understanding&quot; of Komeitofor the $9 billion in aid. But Yoshihisa Inoue, a KomeitoDiet member and official party spokesman, said his party &quot;isin the midst of debating&quot; its position.   &quot;What we can say at this point,&quot; Mr. Inoue said, is that&quot;some increase in {Japan's} financial support is inevitable .. . but it can't be unconditional.&quot; Komeito will demand thatthe funds not be used for arms and that they not be used forpurposes that go beyond the U.N. resolutions.   As controversial as the $9 billion contribution is likelyto be, it may be less so than another element of the planannounced Thursday. In a move that could give Japan the&quot;visible presence&quot; in the Mideast effort that U.S. officialshave called for, government spokesmen said the cabinetintends to authorize the use of Japanese military transportplanes to evacuate refugees from the region. A ForeignMinistry spokesman said that, because the ordinance wouldhave a time limit and would apply only to the Mideast crisis,the government expects it to be less divisive than lastyear's U.N.-cooperation bill.   That may be wishful thinking. Komeito, for one, flatlyopposes the use of military transport planes.   Iraq's ambassador to Japan also got into the act. At anews conference Thursday, he warned that any militaryaircraft operating in the theater of battle would be subjectto attack -- a comment viewed by many as a threat to theJapanese.</TEXT></DOC>
