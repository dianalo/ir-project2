Although Bay Area Rapid Transit unionsstruck a tentative deal with management last week, just a fewweeks earlier they had dismissed an offer that would haveboosted average salaries (overtime included) to $47,746 fortrain operators and ticket agents, and $53,159 for mechanics.They dismissed that offer, moreover, with considerable scorn.   The nature of the workers' pique is somewhat elusive,since the skills necessary to become a BART train operator,let alone a ticket agent, are not quite on the order, say, ofthose required to pilot a 747. Those trains were designed torun without operators, who were put on board to handleemergencies, close the doors, and communicate problems to thecentral office. Computers, for the most part, still directthe trains.</LP><TEXT>   To make a good deal even better, benefits under existingBART contracts amount to 51 cents for every dollar of salary-- compared with a national private-sector average of closerto one-third.   Plush deals are the norm around the country for publictransit workers, and Congress seems intent on funneling stillmore federal taxes to support such folly.   For many environmentalists and members of Congress, it isan article of faith that Americans must be enticed (orforced, should enticement fail) out of their cars in the nameof cleaner air and uncongested roadways, and that one way toachieve this goal is to devote more federal dollars to masstransit. Yet the history of public transit belies any firmrelationship between spending and ridership. If anything, itsuggests that greater federal spending mainly translates intohigher labor costs.   A study published in 1989 by Wharton offers a pile ofevidence for this gloomy forecast. Herbert Northrup andPhilip Miscimarra note, for example, that despite a veritablecollapse in ridership over the years -- 23.2 billionmass-transit passenger rides in 1940, when the industryremained largely in private hands, vs. 8.2 billion in 1983 --the ranks of transit employees declined only to 195,000 from242,000.   Indeed, the Department of Transportation estimated back in1983 that only one-fourth of federal government operatingsubsidies aided local riders in the form of additional tripsor lower fares. Earlier this year, the Urban MassTransportation Administration weighed in with yet anotherreport indicting the transit industry's inefficiency, withspecial emphasis on the federal government's role in thedebacle.   William Shughart II and Mwangi S. Kimenyi, University ofMississippi economists, found that while all subsidies tendedto increase mass transit's costs, state and federal subsidieswere the most likely to be wasted. They recommended linkingmass transit's benefits and costs more closely &quot;bytransferring more of those subsidies, that is, by shiftingthe source of subsidies to lower levels of government. Apolicy that follows a consistent, step-by-step phase-out offederal and state subsidies will not only lead to moreefficient transit systems, but will also motivate the searchfor more cost-effective methods of providing urban masstransportation services.&quot;   Such a search is sorely needed. According to Wendell Cox,a St. Louis-based transportation consultant, per-capitamass-transit ridership increased in only five of the top 39metropolitan areas during the 1980s. Two (Houston andPhoenix) started from a minuscule ridership base, while twoothers (Washington and Portland) count some bus/railpassengers twice. Overall, the per-capita ridership loss was17%. Not even costly new rail systems in San Diego,Sacramento, Buffalo, Baltimore and Atlanta could reverse thefading fortunes of mass transit.   Yet even Mr. Cox's figures understate the decliningimportance of public transit. Employment grew faster thanpopulation during the 1980s, meaning public transit's shareof critical work rides probably dropped 20% or more.   Not that transit agencies are responsible for their lossof market share. Suburban and Western migration, greaterdisposable incomes, and the dispersal of employment all musttake the blame. Yet in the face of such trends, transitagencies should be striving to justify their already generousbudgets through better management -- not pleading for stillmore funds.   A growing number of transit agencies are changing theirways. The Transit Times, a publication of the American BusAssociation, reports that competitive contracting &quot;grew fromalmost nothing to comprise almost 10% of public transit busservice&quot; during the 1980s. The impetus: cost savings thataverage 30% and &quot;have gone as high as 60 percent.&quot;   Unfortunately, federal law inhibits this process through aclause in the Urban Mass Transportation Act that baldlyprotects individual public transit employees &quot;against aworsening of their positions&quot; -- meaning their jobs must beshielded no matter how much more cheaply a private outfit candeliver the same service. Thus the experience of metroDenver's Regional Transportation District: It put 20% of itsbus service out for bid beginning in 1989, but failed torealize any savings during the first year. Not that theyhaven't commenced by now. A performance audit last Decemberby KPMG Peat Marwick projected &quot;a five-year savings resultingfrom privatization, on a fully allocated basis of $29.3million, or 24.5 percent of RTD's inhouse cost.&quot;   If Congress were interested in serving both commuters andtaxpayers, it would restrict federal mass-transit subsidieswhile revising the law to encourage competition.   ---   Mr. Carroll is editor of the editorial pages at the RockyMountain News.</TEXT></DOC>
