Part of the reason has to do with their understanding of the eare andfeeding of NiCad batteries I believe.andP;  The more you demand of them the moreyou get from them.andP;  Puny trickle chargers may be great for longterm batterycharges, but it's the hit'em hard and often concept of the Compaq chargerswhich I believe is partially responsible for their battery successes.andM;What about....andM;What if Windows or a version of DOS which included Windows was to become theaccepted user interface on a laptop?andM;We're being pushed towards graphical user interfaces on the PC.andP;  We alreadyhave one on the Macintosh, so why should we be expected to revert to atext-based system on a laptop? So, following this premise, and the growingtrend putting DOS in ROM on laptops to minimize weight and maximize memory,what about a portable with DOS and Windows in ROM? Any takers?andM;Desktop Systems Since I've talked about laptops I'll take a stab at desktopunits.andM;As far as I am concerned, this will be a year of upgrading systems.andP;  The80386based units will become even more entrenched.andP;  80486's will be aroundand make a big splash, and we'll be getting faster, more powerful systems forless and less money.andP;  The 80386SX systems which are already doing well willcontinue on their path to replace the 8088, 8086 and 80286 systems in use.andO;80386 systems will become more of a commodity (the AT bus versions) and nothing will be resolved on the EISA versus MCA front.andM;Coming Up There will also be some surprises this year.andP;  Commodore might evenmake a dent in the marketplace with some of the new Amiga systems they haveon tap and with a new management team and aggressive marketing tactics.andP;  RISCsystems will become ever more important and more of them will find their wayto the market in 1990 than in the entire life of RISC architecture (HP hasalready made a healthy start in January).andM;Prices will come down in all areas of Intel-based products.andP;  It's alreadypossible to get a really great deal on 8088 and 80286 boxes and the 80386price wars are just beginning to heat up.andP;  Every week the papers carry adsfor lower and lower priced 80386SX and standard 80386 boxes.andP;  Once the 80486drops into the market in quantities, look for 80386 computer prices to fall.andM;Operating Systems I don't believe this will be the year of OS/2, the year ofwindows over DOS, the year of DOS, the year of Unix, or even the year of thePICK operating system.andP;  Instead, it may be a year when users and implementersbecome more concerned with solutions than operating systems, when they feelthat it's possible to connect diverse systems together and share data, andthat it really doesn't matter what platforms are mixed with what (actually,this is more of a two year projection from my vantage point).andM;It will be a year of substantial growth in all of the above operatingsystems' installed bases, and it will be a year in which applications areavailable to provide useable solutions across all of these platforms.andP;  Therewill also be some very exciting advances made in the world of operatingsystems see my Apple comments below).andM;As more and more 80386 boxes find their way to desktops, there will be betterand better memory management schemes available.andP;  Quarterdeck and Microsoftwill lead the way into the world above 640K, just as they have done in thepast.andP;  Since Quarterdeck still appears to understand memory management betterthan the Redmond boys, look for some really exciting products from SantaMonica.andP;  That does not mean, by the way, that others will not be able toprovide very good memory products, only that unless I miss my guess, the mostpopular will come from these two players.andP;  Microsoft, of course, has theadvantage since they are shipping theirs as part of windows and Windows 386and one would suspect that if there were to be a new version of windows, itwould include even better memory management.andP;  Still, the Quarterdeck folkshave demonstrated time and again that they really understand what life above64OK is all about and I'm looking forward to what is forthcoming from them.andO;Unix....andM;Unix will also gain ground in l990.andP;  All of the new BJSC machines can onlyhelp this growth.andP;  Also helping will be the move towards more'standardization&quot; regarding versions of Unix and the extensions.andP;  Still, withall of the move towards OS/2 and the big push being put forth by both IBM andMicrosoft, I don't believe that the percentage of Unix users will be muchhigher by the end of 1990 than it is today.andM;Apple's Operating System All of this talk about operating systems leads me tothe next section.andP;  Recently I was treated to a very full day with the folksfrom Apple and specifically representatives of the System 7.0 team.andP;  I cameaway exhausted from trying to digest what they have in store for us and whatit all means.andM;The first big news is that System 7.0 is now in Alpha form.andP;  Why is this suchbig news? First, because it shows real progress.andP;  Second, because it's thefirst time that all the pieces of the Macintosh code have been put into onepackage and run together  perhaps the biggest stumbling block in the entireprocess).andP;  What this really means is that the System 7.0 team now knows whatpieces will work and which will not.andP;  They also know what problems there arewith compatibility with older machines  (see below), with existing software,and with convincing the software applications folks to start coding inearnest for System 7.0.andM;I came away from the meeting very, very impressed with what I saw.andP;  First andforemost, Apple did an excellent job addressing the new OS to its customerbase.andM;OK, so the minimum amount of RAM for System 7.0 is 2MB.andP;  So what? Twomegabytes is not what the system takes up, rather it's the total amount ofRAM needed to get System 7.0 up and running WITH a number of applications.andO;So, it will take a Macintosh Plus and 2MB of RAM (RAM prices, by the way aregoing down rapidly).andP;  So what if I do not have that, or cannot cost justifyit? Fine, stay with System 6.0.andP;  Both operating systems co-exist just fine onthe same network.andP;  Sure you may not have some of the advanced featuresavailable under system 7.0, but your applications - printer, files, and data- will all continue to work, sitting on a desk right next to a System 7.0installed Macintosh, connected to the very same network.andM;In fact, the installation is really very simple and clever.andP;  Once System 7.0has been installed on a server, each user can access the installation programand their Macintosh is updated automatically.andP;  If some one is using a machinenot capable of running System 7.0, the installation program will indicate it!!andP;  Remember all of the problems with printer drivers? Gone! Now, as thesystem is being installed it will look at your existing system folder,determine which printer drivers you have installed and install only thereplacements for them, no more, no less.andP;  Actually, when I said a MacintoshPlus with 2 megabytes of RAM, that means any Macintosh ever made.andP;  Rememberthat it's still possible to upgrade even a Macintosh 128K to Plus status with2 megabytes of RAM.andP;  Cost....andM;Okay, 2MB of RAM, lets see...andP;  at current prices and with existing computers,that would mean adding an average of 1MB of RAM at about $150.00  even thatis high) and the new System 7.0 software at about $50.00 (give or take $10.)andO;for a total upgrade cost of $200.andP;  Actually, you can purchase a megabyte ofRAM on the street for about $75 and get the operating system from any numberof BBS systems.andP;  The only reason you would pay for it is to get thedocumentation and original disks (which I would highly recommend).andP;  Try thatin the Intel world with OS/2 or even Windows !andP;  If you have a Macintosh withan 68030 in it (the SE/30, the Macintosh llx, the IIcx, and the IIci machinesor the IIx with the optional 68851 PMMU), you get only one additional featurefrom System 7.0 that the rest of the Macintosh world does not get: virtualmemory.andP;  Virtual memory is like being able to double your actual RAM space.andO;If you have two megabytes of RAM it will be like having 4MB, if you havefour, it will be like having 8.andP;  Virtual memory is really the ability to swapprograms and data areas out to the hard disk.andP;  The computer thinks that thisis 'real' memory and, in fact, when you do a  get info' on the finder youwill see a statement that a 2MB machine has 4MB of RAM.andM;Granted that swapping out-to-disk is not as fast as  real' memory, virtualmemory is also smart enough that it knows what you are working on, whichapplications you've  put aside' (most of the time you do not launchapplications, rather you open them upon start-up and then put them aside whenthey are not being directly used) and which you are actively using.andP;  When theswapping does occur you are aware of a slight slow down in systemperformance, but it is still much faster than having to launch an applicationand wait for it to come up to speed.andP;  Printing and background applicationsstill can be handled by virtual memory, so the overall effect is an increasein the performance of the computer.andM;What do I get with 7.0? ALL users get Finder 7.0, Outline Fonts,Interapplication Communications, Database Access, File Sharing, and theability to run 32-bit clear software.andP;  I will briefly comment on each ofthese later on so don't worry if you don't understand some of the terms.andM;Users also get expanded functions with existing applications and hardware, aswell as a smooth transition to System 7.0 specific applications.andP;  By usingvirtual memory, users have the ability to run larger applications and files.andO;Mac Il machines have the ability to access up to 128MB or RAMand 4GB's (Gigabytes) of addressable memory.andM;Let's take a look at System 7.0.andM;First, the System folder can be opened like any other folder.andP;  What thismeans is that things like the Font/DA mover go away.andP;  Now, to add a font or aDA you merely drag it into the system folder.andP;  To delete one you drag it out.andO;Another change is that all DA's  Desk Accesories) are now more like programs.andO;You can open them from the Apple pulldown or directly from the desktop.andP;  Thisalso gives you much more flexibility and, in fact, you can drag completeapplications and/or files to the Apple menu and launch them directly from it.andM;Some things which users of 7.0 may not  see,' but which seasoned Macintoshusers will notice and enjoy, include the ability to drag a file or folderfrom one folder to another without having to play 'select the folder&quot; games.andO;If you click on a file, you can smoothly drag it from one folder to anotherwithout having to select the new folder or level.andM;Fonts System 7.0 has received a great deal of press about their fonts.andP;  Appleis going to be using its own outline fonts at the system level.andP;  These fontspecifications have already been published and room has been left in thedescription language for additions to the basic scaling information.andO;Basically System 7.0 will continue to work with any fonts you already have inyour system and on your printer, but the ones which arc provided with the newsystem will be replaced and outline fonts will be used.andM;Why outline fonts? Basically, what they provide are sharp text at any size onany device including low-end printers, and they're easier to use.andP;  Thetechnology permits the storage of a single outline character for each font.andO;This outline is then mathematically refined and sized as required, andprovides a much cleaner looking font representation - especially on lowresolution devices like dotmatrix printers.andP;  Most of the major players withinthe type industry have announced support for the Apple Outline Fonts as havedevelopers and printer vendors.andP;  In fact, many companies have asked tolicense Apple's font scaler for use in their own products.andM;The result? There should be more fonts available for the Macintosh than evershortly.andP;  Fonts should be cheaper to purchase, easier to install, able to bemoved in and out of the System folder at will, and have far better printersupport.andP;  Politics not withstanding, it appears as i Apple has taken whatcould have been a negative facet of the new system (no Adobe fonts) and madeit into a very nice positive.andP;  IAC One of the most exciting things to meabout System 7.0 has to do with the InterApplications Communications (IAC).andO;This is not simple DDE  direct data exchange) but in fact, goes far beyondDDE.andP;  Certainly it will provide the ability to move data from one applicationto another, and it will provide the ability to link data and update iteasily, but it will also provide the ability for one program to controlanother.andM;The example that Apple had set-up for me to see was very impressive.andP;  It wasa CAD program (Claris CAD) with a drawing of a house interior, complete withfurnishings, tied directly to Claris's File Maker II database program (Bothof these programs have been modified by Claris for this demonstration.andO;Claris has not announced either of these enhancements to its products at thispoint.)andM;When I selected a new chair to add to the family room the description of it,its maker, and its price was added to the database in FileMaker.andP;  When Iasked Filemaker to provide me with a list of all items costing over $600 notonly did it do this, but it also highlighted them in ClarisCAD so I could seewhere they were in the rendering.andM;Part of the theory of IAC is that it will permit users to  build' anintegrated software environment.andP;  For example, it so happens that I use threedifferent programs, each of which has a spelling module installed.andP;  I cannever keep my word list in all of them up-to-date.andP;  Using IAC I could use aseparate spelling and dictionary program, linking it to all of myapplications and provide myself with an integrated group of applications.andM;Another of the more powerful features of IAC is an area referred to asPublish' and  Subscribe.' In this instance you publish an item, any item, andthen from within any application you subscribe to it.andP;  Sounds like cut andpaste? Well it is, but with a twist.andP;  Not only can you easily 'cut and paste'the document which  subscribed&quot; to, the published item knows where it camefrom (even from a floppy disk), and if the main item is updated, thesubscribed item will also be (unless you've  frozen&quot; it - in which case itwill remain static until you manually tell it to update itself to the mainitem).andM;This is a very powerful tool.andP;  Now I can &quot;publish&quot; our logo and import itinto any document, drawing, file, or whatever.andP;  I never have to worry aboutwhat format it's in.andP;  Is it a TIFF file? Is it a PICT file? In the case of Publish' and &quot;Subscribe,&quot; it just doesn't matter.andP;  How about a server-based published&quot; file which contains all of the forms needed in day-to-dayoperations? How about drawings, clip-art, and other things needed for aproject? Publish them to the group and each member has full access to any andall of them, and you can update them from your desk and know that they havebeen updated on each and every document they are contained in.andP;  Neat.andM;Now, lets take this IAC idea one step further.andP;  Apple has provided a commonvocabulary for applications.andP;  These nouns and verbs of user interaction willbe the core technology for a future AppleScript which will permit oneapplication to actually run another.andP;  You could, for example, embed a commandin your document which would send a command across the network to anothersystem, open an Excel file, download new data from a host, run calculationsand return the results to your first document, all remotely and all untouchedby human hands.andP;  Apple has even provided advanced protocols for text,graphics, database, and calculations, as well as leaving the core scriptingavailable to be added later by developers who may discover new &quot;nouns&quot; and'verbs' to be included in the future (I want one that says &quot;make coffee&quot;).andM;Apple event categories include database, finder, calc, text, presentation,graphics, common, and basic.andP;  Yes, they are even providing events so thatfrom an application I could instruct the finder to do a function for me andthen return me to the application.andP;  If Apple developers pick up on these events', then more and more applications will be able to communicate andcontrol applications.andM;IAC will permit applications to both connect and communicate, providing toolsto let applications work together.andP;  It works on one Macintosh or betweenMacintoshes with security.andP;  It provides 'live' copy/paste functions with anyapplication and with a single user model.andP;  On top of this, Apple Events setsthe stage for communications standards between applications so that everyapplication will be able to communicate with every other application withouthaving to worry about file exchange or file translations.andP;  Database AccessManagerandM;Apple has decided that the ability to access data from anywhere it resides isone of the keys to the success of computing (all of this with reasonablesecurity and safeguards).andP;  In an effort to provide a path for this type ofdata access, they have included a DAM(Data Access Manager) in System 7.0.andO;This DAM is based on CL/1 and goes a step beyond SQL access.andP;  SQL is based onaccessing data which is stored in a standard format.andP;  CL/1 provides access tothis data, but also to data which is not stored in any SQL accessible formatand yet may be required by the end-user.andM;Apple is throwing this DAM into System 7.0 to provide a network independent,standard interface for developers, and to make every Macintosh DatabaseReady.&quot; Supported by most of the major database players (AshtonTate, Oracle,Informix, Blyth, ACIUS, Odesta, and Neuron Data, for starters), it willprovide a simple user interface for pulling data from multiple data basemanagement systems at no additional cost to the end-user.andP;  The demonstrationsI saw included applications which had been built to access the DAM and a deskaccessory designed to provide data access to a simple series of queries.andP;  Thefull impact of this System 7.0 feature may not be readily apparent at thistime.andP;  But if enough developers embrace it, this could be the equivalent ofOracle's access to data from within standard applications on the PC side(however, Apple gives this away in their system so it is available to everyMacintosh user).andP;  Finder 7.0andM;Looking at the finder, I was confused, as most people are, as to exactly whata finder feature was, and what was handled by the system or some other partof the OS.andP;  The folks at Apple were very patient and helped me understand, indetail, exactly what it is the finder does now, and what it will do in thefuture.andM;In doing this, it was explained that the goals in the design phase of Finder7.0 were to upgrade the existing finder, and to provide functionally thatwould permit: 1) doing more without having to learn more, 2) to naturallyextend the finder, 3) to provide greater intuitive access and 4) to give theuser more control.andM;All of these words sound great, but what do they translate to? Well, some ofthe  mundane' features which have been added include: Auto-scrolling (bandselect and drag), zoom will now automatically size windows, direct access tothe desktop from within an application (move to the desktop to make a newfolder while still in Microsoft Word, for example), copy files in background(boy, do I ever need this one - it will not, however, provide for floppy diskformatting in the background, just file copying - but that is better thannothing at all), and as I have already mentioned, moving a file from abackground window without having to play &quot;select the window'.andP;  Further, aseries of system-wide help functions arc being incorporated.andP;  This wasimplemented in a neat way.andP;  All you do is to ask for help and a little pop-up&quot;bubble'-like carton character appears on-screen.andP;  A  FIND' command has beenincluded, not just a &quot;find file' desk accessory but a real, honest togoodness FIND which works at the finder level and is very, very quick.andP;  A newselect' has also been added to provide operations on selected files.andM;You can now have multiple printers on your desktop.andP;  The Apple File Menu isnot limited to 15 DA's and can be updated immediately by dragging any iteminto it (see above).andP;  DAs are now external to the System file, Fonts andSounds still reside in the System folder but may be dragged in and out.andO;Fonts, Sounds, CDEVs, and DAs may be directly opened, and a more consistentinterface is provided for them (ever wonder what the inside of your systemfile looked like? Now you will be able to open it and see).andM;Users will be able to provide a very high level of configuration to theirMacintoshes.andP;  Custom views are supported, as is Icon Editing, finderpreference selection, and other user features provided in the Apple menufolder help each user design the system to fit their own needs.andM;AliasingandM;Perhaps one of the very nicest Finder enhancements was one decsribed to methat I did not understand until thought about it for a while.andP;  Once Iunderstood what aliasing is all about I got very excited.andP;  The simplestexplanation is that if you have a program which needs to reside in a specificfolder and which cannot be dragged to the bottom of the screen and launchedfrom there, you can build an Alias file of it and move it to the bottom ofthe screen.andM;All this 'Alias&quot; is, is a file that  points&quot; to the actual file.andP;  Now you canhave as many Aliases as you want for a given file.andP;  Even if you move themaster file around, the Alias still knows where it is.andP;  How about backing upyour hard disk onto 50 floppies, but keeping an Alias of some of the filesyou might want? All you do then is to click on the Alias and it says to you:'Please insert back-up disk number 34&quot;, you insert it, and bingo, up comesthe file.andM;How about dividing your desktop into projects and having alias files in eachone for the data which is stored on the server? Yes, an Alias can log you onto the server(pausing for youto enter your password if needed), open the fileand place it on your desktop for you.andP;  At this point you should alsounderstand enough about Aliases to come up with your own uses for it.andP;  Neatidea, Apple!! Sun Down or Tops Down?andM;Maybe this is too broad a statement to make.andP;  However, if I were SunMicrosystems Inc., I would sure be trying to find a new home for TOPS or atleast find a way to really upgrade the product.andP;  Why? Because what Apple isproviding in System 7.0 is just about everything you get with Tops, onlyfree.andM;Apple bills the new system as an intuitive file sharing system integratedwith Finder 7.0, and compatible with existing AppleShare clients andapplications.andP;  I would promote it as TOPS built into System 7.0, and thefirst time that each and every hard disk can be used as a server in an Appleprovided network (Appleshare now requires a dedicated server).andM;I think of it as almost everything TOPS is today.andP;  Each user manages his orher own files and publishes those that are to be shared with others.andO;Password protection is provided and personal files can be protected fromaccess by others.andP;  Further, a user can access his own files from anyMacintosh on the network and each owner can turn sharing on and off.andP;  It is afeature built into the file menu.andP;  No access is required via the Apple menu,and it is fully compatible with the AppleTalk Filing Protocol and iscompatible with both System 6.0 and 7.0 systems.andM;The new system is transparent to Ap -  pleShare users and is non-dedicated.andO;NoandM;administration of the network required.andM;Of course, like TOPS, if a user whoseandM;files are shared goes home and turns offandM;his or her Macintosh, those files areandM;lost' to other users until the user returnsandM;and restores the sharing status ofandM;their computer to the system.andM;Apple has, ever since the MacintoshandM;was first introduced, provided the basicsandM;of a free network anyway.andP;  All printers onandM;AppIeTalk are shared and accessible byandM;every user.andP;  What Apple has done withandM;System 7.0 is to add file sharing to theandM;network.andP;  In this regard, they have providedandM;two of the main uses for a network,andM;printer and file-sharing.andP;  UsingandM;this file sharing system offers users theandM;best of both worlds.andP;  A central server canandM;still be utilized for company-wide applicationsandM;and information, while theandM;smaller file sharing system can co-existandM;on top of it, permitting work groups toandM;share files without having to have themandM;located on a dedicated server.andM;General impressionsandM;I am pleased with Apple's progress andandM;believe that System 7.0 will go a longandM;way toward keeping Apple in the forefrontandM;of corporate computing.andP;  Apple has taken a good operating system and made itbetter.andP;  They have listened to users and included features which add to thesystem and enhanced it with functions which SHOULD be part of an operatingsystem.andM;They have provided developers plenty of room to be inventive and have giventhem more tools and directions.andP;  By using virtual memory they permitdevelopers to build more robust and larger applications and to be able tohandle more data.andP;  They provide users with a much richer environment andpermit them to keep all of the applications they use up and running all ofthe time.andM;And ...andP;  they have done all of this with the very minimum 'hit' on user'spocketbooks.andP;  Older Macintoshes can be kept and be very useful using system6.0, or they can be cheaply upgraded to take full advantage of the newfeatures and functions of System 7.0.andP;  Installation is both painless andeasy, it solves the problems presently experienced by users on a network withdifferent versions of print drivers, and the new System 7.0 goes a long wayto make a Macintosh an even more useful computer.andM;Some developers have already been seeded' with System 7.0, others will begetting it very shortly.andP;  End-users should have it available this summer, andI can't wait to get my hands on the first available beta copy of it.andO;Congratulations Apple, it's a winner! ON Location Mitchell Kapor, founder ofLotus Corporation, founded ON Technology in October of 1987 with PeterMiller.andP;  Since then, there's been speculation regarding the products that ONwould release.andM;The wait is over.andP;  On January 22 ON announced ON Location ($130), a Macintoshdesk accessory that reduces the time it takes to find and view files.andM;The program indexes the name and text of files on any volume, including harddisks, network servers, diskettes, and CD-ROMs.It's also the only Macintoshprogram to combine digital-signature compression technology, Claris/ DataVizfile translators for displaying text stored in most word processing formats,and automatic background indexing.andM;According to Mitch, the key benefit of On Location is the speed of itssearch.andP;  As you type words or file names in its search window, On Locationimmediately begins looking for your file,' he saidandM;Welcome back Mitch</TEXT></DOC>
