Gold pricesturned mixed.   The dollar hovered at a 30-month high against the West Germanmark in late trading, a 28-month high against the French franc, an18-month high against the British pound and eight-month highsagainst the Japanese yen and the French franc.   Dealers said central banks sold dollars after the U.S.government reported U.S. producer prices rose a modest 0.4 percentin April. Market forecasts had predicted a 0.7-percent rise.   But despite repeated interventions by the U.S. Federal Reserve,aided by the West German, British, Swiss, French, Italian, Belgianand Canadian central banks, the dollar had lost little ground bythe end of trading.   The dollar's recovery was fueled bye Last Crusade,'' ``GhostbustersII,'' ``TheKarate Kid III'' or ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''?   All of them have a fighting chance, since all are sequels tofilms that earned more than $100 million in the United States andCanada. The film industry figures ``Indiana Jones'' and``Ghostbusters II'' show the most promise for leading the pack,along with a new version of ``Batman'' starring Michael Keaton andJack Nicholson.   There are other deja vu offerings in this sequel summer:   Timothy Dalton makes his second coming as James Bond in``License to Kill.'' Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return to theirLos Angeles Police Department posts in ``Lethal Weapon II.''Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed and Michael York play their oldroles in ``The Return of the Musketeers.'' There's also ``Fridaythe 13th VIII'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street V.''   What makes a $100 million grosser?   ``Number one, you need a broad opening in the summertime,'' saidRichard Lederer, who does marketing Warner Bros. and OrionPictures. ``You need anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 theaters(Paramount has 2,000 for `Indiana Jones').   ``It's important to open with a bang and continue to run forweeks; you can't have a drop-off in the second or third week. If apicture opens to medium business and starts to surprise, it'simportant to add theaters right away. Summer is the important time,and it's imperative to get as many theaters as possible.   ``Most of the big winners are lighter fare, since that's what isreleased during the summer. Strong dramas are usually held forDecember.''   A survey of the $100 million movies of the past five years bearsout Lederer's theories. The only drama on the list is the AcademyAward-winning ``Rain Man,'' which has earned $160 million since itsrelease last December.   Here is how the other $100 million movies of the past five yearsbreak down (figures in millions from Exhibitor Relations Co.):   Comedies and comedy-adventures: ``Ghostbusters'' (1984, $221);``Beverly Hills Cop'' (1984, $230); ``Back to the Future'' (1985,$220); ``Crocodile Dundee'' (1986, $175); ``Good Morning, Vietnam''(1987, $125); ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' (1987, $154); ``Three Menand a Baby'' (1987, $168); ``Twins'' (1988, $103); ``CrocodileDundee II'' (1988, $109); ``Big'' (1988, $113); ``Coming toAmerica'' (1988, $128); ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988, $153).   Action-adventures and Fantasies: ``Gremlins'' (1984, $148);``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984, $175); ``Rambo II''(1985, $150); ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986, $109);``Platoon'' (1985, $137); ``Top Gun'' (1986, $177).   Thriller: ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987, $157).   As usual, comedies will be prevalent during the 1989 summer.   ``Eric the Viking,'' is a spoof from Monty Python's Terry Joneswith Tim Robbins, John Cleese and Mickey Rooney.   ``Do the Right Thing,'' is another outrageous comedy from SpikeLee (``School Daze''), starring Danny Aiello.   ``Uncle Buck,'' stars John Candy and Amy Madigan in a JohnHughes film.   ``Parenthood,'' features Steve Martin, Tom Hulce and RickMoranis, and is directed by Ron Howard (''Cocoon.'')   ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' is a murder caper with Andrew McCarthyand Jonathan Silverman.   ``Turner andamp; Hooch,'' stars Oscar nominee Tom Hanks as aby-the-book cop, and like the current ``K-9,'' his partner is a dog.   ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is a courtship comedy from RobReiner (``Stand by Me''), with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.   The action-adventure junkies will find satisfaction in thesummer fare, aside from Indiana Jones, James Bond, Ghostbusters andMusketeers, there are the following:   James Cameron (``Aliens'') is delving into ``The Abyss,'' withEd Harris plunging 25,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean. KrisKristofferson and Cheryl Ladd go time-traveling in ``Millenium.''Clint Eastwood returns as a fugitive on the trail of bail-jumperBernadette Peters in ``Pink Cadillac.''   The Vietnam War is once again explored in ``Casualties of War''with Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox. Kiefer Sutherland and LouDiamond Phillips are a mismatched pair seeking revenge against asavage murderer in ``Renegades.'' Patrick Swayze plays a legendarytroubleshooter in ``Road House.''   Dramatic fare won't be entirely overlooked during thehot-weather months. Robin Williams goes straight as a charismaticschoolteacher in Australia in ``Dead Poets Society.'' Tom Selleckseeks vindication after being wrongly sentenced to prison in ``HardRain,'' not to be confused with ``Black Rain,'' with MichaelDouglas as a New York detective delving into the Osaka underworld.   For Jerry Lee Lewis fans, Randy Quaid will portray the keyboardthumper in ``Great Balls of Fire,'' the only film resembling amusical this summer.   And there's not much for the wee ones, except for a rerelease ofDisney's classic ``Peter Pan.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, May 19</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
