The deportations raised to 60 the number of Palestinians expelledfrom the occupied territories during the 20-month uprising againstIsraeli rule.   Four Palestinians were deported to Lebanon. A fifth, physicistTaysir Aruri, whose cause has been championed by international humanrights groups, was expelled to France after he appealed to Israel'sSupreme Court, saying he could face death in Lebanon.   The deportations came as Israel bombed a pro-Iranian Shiitestronghold in southeast Lebanon, killing one guerrilla and woundingfive others, police reported. It was the ninth Israeli air raid intoLebanon this year.   Aruri's wife brought their three young children to Ben GurionAirport to see their father off. But she was removed by police aftershe became the center of a scuffle involving pro-Palestiniandemonstrators and angry Israelis.   Aruri did not speak to reporters when he arrived in Paris. Therehas been speculation he was headed for Tunis, headquarters of thePalestine Liberation Organization. But late Sunday, PLO sources saidhe could be planning to go to the United States.   Aruri has held meetings with Israeli peace activists. Headvocates peaceful creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.   Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said on army radioSunday that Israel would continue to deport Palestinians despitecomplaints by foreign governments and human rights groups that theaction violates international law.   Shomron said Israel considers deportation an effective deterrentagainst the uprising.   The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Aruri waswelcome indefinitely in France, and referred to his expulsion as ``ameasure contrary to the Geneva Convention protecting civilians intime of war.''   The United States also has condemned such expulsions as aviolation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.   None of the five Palestinians expelled Sunday faced trial orformal charges. Appeals by four of the men were rejected by theSupreme Court Thursday, and the fifth was turned down a monthearlier. The court never has overturned an army deportation order.   Aruri, 43, a physics professor at the West Bank's Bir ZeitUniversity named a ``prisoner of conscience'' by AmnestyInternational, was accused of being a member of the outlawedPalestinian Communist Party.   The army also said he was ``involved in planning the uprising anda member of the uprising's unified command.'' The announcement ofthe four other deportations said the men ``participated in leadingand directing the uprising'' in the West Bank.   One deportee, Mohammed Matur, was accused by the army of being aleader of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction. Theothers were said to be members of the Marxist Democratic Front forthe Liberation of Palestine, a leftist PLO group.   On arrival in south Lebanon, Lebanese police reported the fourasked to be taken to bases of the Democratic Front in western Bekaavalley.   Sunday's air raid into Lebanon was believed to be in retaliationfor the Aug. 9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by theIranian-supported Hezbollah. Five Israeli soldiers and an alliedLebanese militiaman were injured in the car bombing, and Israeliofficials have vowed to avenge the attack.   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has said it carried out thebombing to avenge Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric,Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid. Israeli commandos seized Obeid in asouthern Lebanese village on July 28.</TEXT></DOC>
