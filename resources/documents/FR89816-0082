SEAONCis a professional association comprised of California-lincensed structuralengineers and civil engineers who provide structural engineering services.SEAONC is one of four regional associations that make up the state-levelStructural Engineers Association of California. The agreement with thepropsed respondent would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commissionthat it violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by restrictingor attempting to restrict its members from: (1) Soliciting business bytruthful advertising; (2) engaging in price competition; and (3) providingservices to pesons or entities that are the clients or other engineers.The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and takeother appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained inthe agreement.The ComplaintA complaint has been prepared for issuance by the Commission along withthe proposed order. It alleges that SEAONC is a voluntary professionalassociation of structural engineers who comprise over 70% of the NorthernCalifornia-licensed structural engineers and civil servants who performstructural engineering. It also alleges that SEAONC's members compete amongthemselves and with other structural engineers. The complaint alleges thatthe propsoed respondent acted as a combination of its members or has conspiredwith at least some of its members to restrict competition. In particular,it alleges that SEAONC has restricted its members from: (1) Solicitingbusiness by truthful advertising; (2) engaging in price competition; and(3) providing services to the clients of other engineers.According to the complaint, the proposed respondent enacted and publishedcanons of ethics that: (1) Prohibit its members from advertising theirwork or merit in a self-laudatory manner (2) require that its members whenengaging in engineering work uphold the principle of appropriate and adequatecompensation for engineers and for employees in subordinate capacities;and (3) prohibit its members from reviewiing the work performed by anotherengineer for the same client except with reason to believe that the otherengineer's contract for services is not in contention.The complaint further alleges that the restraints injured consumers inthe following ways, among others: (1) By depriving consumers of truthfulinformation; (2) by restraining price competition; (3) by preventing consumersfrom obtaining an expert second opinion of a structural engineer's work;and (4) by hindering competition among structural engineers.The Proposed Consent OrderPart I of the proposed order provides a definition of SEAONC. Part II prohibitsSEAONC from restricting, regulating, impeding, declaring unethical, orinterfering with: (1) Truthful, non-deceptive advertising; (2) the considerationoffered or provided to any engineer in return for the sale or purchaseof his or her professional services; and (3) any engineer providing oroffering to provide services to persons or entities that are the clientsof other engineers.Part II of the propsed order does not prohibit SEAONC from adopting reasonableethical quidelines governing the conduct of its members with respect to:(1) Representations, including unsubstantiated representations, that SEAONCreasonably believes would be false or deceptive within the meaning of section5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;\1\<NOTE/> and (2) the notice to be provided to an engineer prior toany review of this work by another engineer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The copy of the consent agreement of the public recorddoes not contain the signatures usually found on an original document.This is because the agreement as presented to the Commission did not includethe phrase ``SEAONC reasonably believes'' in section (1) of the provisoin Part II of the order. The Commission determined to insert that phrasebefore accepting the agreement for comment. See the amended order in thematter of the American Medical Ass'n, et al., Dkt. 9064, 99 F.T.C. 440,441 (1982).Part III of the proposed order requires SEAONC to remove provisions fromits canons of ethics that are inconsistent with the proposed order, andto publish in its newsletter a revised version of its canons of ethicsand a copy of the order. Part III of the proposed order also requires SEAONCto file a compliance report within 60 days after the order becomes final,and for five years to permit Commission staff access to proposed respondent'srecords for compliance purposes. Finally, Part III of the proposed orderrequires that the proposed respondent notify the Commission prior to achange in the association which may affect compliance with the order.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment of the proposedorder, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and proposed order or to modify its terms in any way.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
