The $308 billion figure for military spending authority is $18 billion above the current level but $10 billion less than the Pentagon wants. At the same time, officials said the administration also is likely to propose granting the military a supplemental appropriation for the current fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 30.    Officials maintained that the fiscal 1988 request for defense, if finally approved by Mr. Reagan, would be perceived by Congress as more &quot;politically realistic&quot; than previous military budget requests, which have been rejected as too large.    This will be the first time that a president has requested spending levels exceeding $1 trillion; last February, Mr. Reagan requested $994 billion for the current fiscal year. Spending for the current year, however, is ultimately expected to top $1 trillion.    The pending budget includes $50 billion in proposed domestic spending cuts, sales of federal assets and other revenue-raising measures that would shrink the projected fiscal 1988 deficit to slightly below the $108 billion target the Gramm-Rudman law set.    In some cases, the revenue-raising measures closely resemble tax increases, which Mr. Reagan has sworn to oppose. Among the proposals are a plan to extend Medicare coverage to state and local employees, a move that would raise about $1.5 billion in payroll taxes in fiscal 1988.    Another proposal would compel restaurateurs and other employers to contribute about $400 million more in Social Security taxes on the tip income of their employees.    One senior official said the administration has considered raising excise taxes on certain consumer items, such as alcohol and tobacco, a step that would represent a major crack in the president's no-tax stance. &quot;Do not be surprised if you see something like that in our package,&quot; the official said, referring to the budget that the White House is scheduled to submit to Congress Jan. 5.    If the president approved the excise tax idea, he would define the levies as methods of discouraging &quot;the consumption of certain things&quot; that impose costs on society, the official said. &quot;The president would not call these taxes.&quot;    Other officials said that currently the White House doesn't plan to propose excise-tax increases but eventually may be forced to accept the idea, either during its own attempts to draft a budget that meets the Gramm-Rudman targets or during next year's battle in Congress.    Although lawmakers have responded favorably to past proposals to increase federal receipts, they have generally disregarded the president's requests to slash domestic spending.    Meanwhile, officials disclosed that the administration is inclined to adopt a less-optimistic economic forecast for the new budget than the 4.2% inflation-adjusted growth currently forecast for the 1987 calendar year. A group of top administration economists has tentatively agreed upon a forecast of 3.5% inflation-adjusted growth for next year, but the official forecast hasn't yet been decided by the cabinet-level group responsible.    At a cabinet meeting yesterday, President Reagan told agency heads they could appeal to him to overturn the budget cuts drafted by the Office of Management and Budget. But he urged them to adopt a cooperative attitude and warned that because of the Gramm-Rudman law, any restoration of budget funds would require offsetting cuts.    According to a source who attended the meeting, Labor Secretary William Brock drew a big laugh by asking: &quot;When we offset, must we offset within our own department?&quot;    The Defense Department had hoped the president would approve a $318 billion military budget for fiscal 1988 to compensate in part for the $30 billion that Congress lopped off Mr. Reagan's $320 billion request for fiscal 1987.    But White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and Budget Director James Miller have said they favor a fiscal 1988 request of $308 billion, a 3% inflation-adjusted increase above the amount enacted for the current fiscal year. The president indicated at a meeting Tuesday that he leans toward the Regan-Miller position, sources said.    &quot;We are not going to ask for the moon, like in the past,&quot; one White House official said. Another added: &quot;There's a perception that the old strategy of, 'Let's ask for 10% and get 5%,' is not the best strategy.&quot;    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger may yet persuade the president to seek a higher amount. But officials said the Pentagon chief, who has often triumphed over administration foes in budget disputes in the past, appears likely to agree to the $308 billion budget request.    Congressional leaders have said Congress is likely to approve only enough to keep the Pentagon even with inflation in fiscal 1988. And a supplemental appropriation for the current fiscal year would face an uncertain fate given the requirement under the Gramm-Rudman law for offsetting rescissions in other programs.    But administration officials said the White House will be able to play a more effective role in the coming battle over fiscal priorities if it submits a budget that contains a more realistic proposal for the Defense Department.    As expected, the budget will include a number of proposals that were unsuccessful last year, including the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve and the Bonneville Power Administration. Some administration and congressional aides think Congress will go along with selling the petroleum reserve this year. But resistance to the Bonneville idea was so strong that lawmakers passed a resolution prohibiting the administration from spending any federal money to study it.    The budget also includes a proposal to raise about $2 billion from better enforcement of the tax laws by expanding the Internal Revenue Service budget. The IRS already is receiving an 11% increase in the current fiscal year, bringing its budget to $4.2 billion.    Officials said that the Treasury sought -- and the budget office largely granted -- an IRS budget close to $5 billion for fiscal 1988, along with a supplemental appropriation of $100 million for the current fiscal year.    Overall, the Treasury Department budget was pared to about $6.5 billion from a $7.2 billion request, officials said.    The administration's tentative budget also includes a proposal to enact legislation entitled the Credit Reform Act of 1987, aimed at setting up a new mechanism to sell federal loans to private investors. The administration last year proposed selling several billion dollars of existing federal loans; as reported, the Office of Management and Budget plans to sell newly granted federal loans as well, within weeks after they're made.    According to administration documents, the budget office's current plan is to raise $2.9 billion from the sale of new loans having a face value of $4.4 billion. Among the programs whose loans would be sold are the Rural Electrification Administration, Small Business Administration, Export-Import Bank, and housing programs for the elderly and handicapped.    Many lawmakers consider loan sales to be a phony form of deficit reduction because they help shrink the deficit in the near term -- thereby helping to meet the Gramm-Rudman target -- while increasing it in the long term. That's because the Treasury receives a quick infusion of cash but loses the stream of principal and interest payments in the future.    Budget Director Miller contends that loan sales lead to better credit management, partly because the sales help to identify the subsidy involved in federal loans -- the difference between their face value and the price received for them in the open market.    The proposed legislation would require federal agencies to seek appropriations from Congress for the estimated amount of the subsidy. It also would require agencies that provide loan guarantees to seek private insurance for those guarantees.    The cost of such insurance would ultimately total about $7 billion, according to the administration documents. But the budget office is proposing to spend only $500 million on insurance in fiscal 1988, the first year of the program. </TEXT></DOC>
