This paper presents an overviewof efforts under way at NASA Lewis to advance and apply computationaltechnology to ICFM. These efforts include the use of modern, softwareengineering principles for code development, the development of an AI-baseduser-interface for large codes, the establishment of a high-performance,data communications network to link ICFM researchers and facilities,and the application of parallel processing to speed up computationallyintensive and/or time-critical ICFM problems. A multistage compressorflow physics program is cited as an example of efforts to use advancedcomputational technology to enhance a current NASA Lewis ICFM researchprogram.</TEXT></DOC>
