A thermo-dynamic study is presented for a combined TVC andmulti-effect boiling system (MEB) with different energy and mass flowsheets. This analysis is applied on a study case of an existing plant,and the outcomes showed that the plant performance is very much relatedto the flowsheet used. Results showed that, by means of a proper choiceof a specific arrangement, the plant performance could be significantlyimproved. This is demonstrated in arrangement II in which the water productionis increased by more than 100% of its original magnitude when the toptemperature for the brine is raised to 133.9{sup 0}C. This is achievedthrough an extra heat amount of 42% and an increase in the heat-transfersurface of about 50%. 12 references, 8 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
