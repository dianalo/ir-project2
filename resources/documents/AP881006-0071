The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 95.53 pointsWednesday, lost another 233.15 points, or 0.85 percent, to finishtrading at 27,172.34. The index fell for the fifth straight day forthe first time this year.   An analyst at Nomura Securities said the market's poorperformance stemmed from uncertainty before the release of U.S.unemployment figures for September, scheduled for Friday.   ``And of course, another major reason is the condition of theemperor, although very few people mention it directly,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Emperor Hirohito, 87, has been in serious condition since hevomited blood Sept. 19.   Trading was light, with volume on the first section estimated at600 million shares, and only a few issues such as paper and pulpattracted attention.   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 133.30 yen, down 0.18 yen fromWednesday's close of 133.48 yen. Opening slightly higher at 133.37yen, the currency ranged between 133.30 and 133.53 yen.   ``The dollar-yen rate was moving very little as investors tradedthe currencies only for their speculative reasons and positionadjustment,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.   Other dealers said the market lacked incentives and dealers werecautious while awaiting the U.S. unemployment report.</TEXT></DOC>
