In a policy directive to be sent today to the enforcementagency's 50 field offices, the EEOC said it wouldn't pursuepunitive damages for newly eligible groups under the law incases alleging employment discrimination that occurred beforethe legislation was enacted Nov. 21. There are more than60,000 such cases now pending before the commission.</LP><TEXT>   Prior to the law's passage, only victims of job bias basedon race were eligible to receive punitive damages. Under thenew law, victims of job bias based on sex, religion,disability, and national origin also may receive punitivedamages, though the amount may not exceed caps set at variouslevels, depending on the size of the company being sued.   The question of whether the civil rights law should applyretroactively stirred controversy when the legislation wasbeing considered by Congress last fall. The bill's chiefsponsor, Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), opposed language thatwould have made the legislation apply to cases filed beforethe bill's enactment, while civil rights groups argued infavor of such language.   The bill's final wording was vague on the issue. But thelegislation did exempt certain individuals from retroactiveapplication of the law, which civil rights groups contendimplies that the law could be applied retroactively in othercases. Since the legislation was enacted, various courts havesplit on the question.   The issue will almost certainly reach the Supreme Court,which in recent years has leaned toward the presumption thatlaws don't apply retroactively unless Congress explicitlystates otherwise.   The EEOC directive, which was drafted by the agency'soffice of legal counsel and signed by EEOC Chairman Evan Kempon Dec. 27, addresses only the issue of punitive damages. Itwas first reported in the New York Times.   Mr. Kemp declined in an interview to say whether thecommission would issue policy directives on whether otheraspects of the job bias law, such as its shifting of theburden of proof toward employers in suits alleging jobdiscrimination, should be applied retroactively. But thelegal arguments made in the directive suggest that the EEOChas concluded that the entire civil rights bill should applyonly to conduct that occurred after the law was enacted.</TEXT></DOC>
