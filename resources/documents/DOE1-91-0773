<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0773 </DOCNO><TEXT>Outlines the history of the Warsaw Gasworks, established in 1856 as aprivate enterprise and nationalized in 1925. Destroyed during World WarII, it was rebuilt and distributes four times more gas than before theWar, or eight times more when counted in calories. The first gas pipelineconnecting Warsaw with the national network was completed in 1950. Thelast installation generating gas from coal was shut down in 1970 andthe last unit generating town gas from natural gas was shut down in 1978.Such problems as mixing liquid gas with air and decompressing it, replacingtown gas with natural gas, and transporting compressed gas in tank carshave been solved at the Gasworks. The gas pipeline Kobryn (USSR)-Warsawhas been completed and put into operation and a second pipeline to Pulawywill soon follow. The gas pipeline Warsaw-Wloclawek is under construction.Many towns in the Warsaw region have been connnected to the gas networkrecently and there are good prospects for future developments in gasengineering in this region.</TEXT></DOC>
