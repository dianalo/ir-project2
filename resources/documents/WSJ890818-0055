An official of the Spring Valley, N.Y., company disclosed for the first time that it has temporarily stopped shipping the 150 products. Richard J. Nadler, vice president, finance and administration, said the company expects to be hurt longer term because of a production slowdown caused by the FDA probe.    Drugs that Par stopped shipping represent about 40% of its fiscal third-quarter revenue of $27.6 million, said Mr. Nadler. He said shipments were halted about a week ago but don't involve any injectable drugs produced by the company's Quad Pharmaceutical unit.    However, Par disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the FDA's inspection of the company, including Quad, continues. In its filing, Par said sales and gross margins of Quad's injectable line &quot;may also be adversely affected, although to a lesser extent.&quot;    The company agreed to the suspension after discussing with FDA compliance officials &quot;some potentially significant manufacturing problems,&quot; said Jeffrey Nesbit, chief FDA spokesman.    Citing the manufacturing problems, the FDA recently revoked approval for Par's version of chlorzoxazone, a muscle relaxant innovated by a Johnson andamp; Johnson division. Par also said it's prevented from obtaining other drug approvals during the FDA investigation, and it doesn't have any idea how long the probe will continue.    Also, Par's management is in turmoil. Its president, Perry Levine, 68 years old, a founder, has said he plans to retire, because of poor health, when the company finds a successor. Other executives, including Mr. Levine's son, Jeffrey, have taken voluntary leaves of absence. Jeffrey Levine, an executive vice president, was forced to step aside because outside directors felt he hadn't acted quickly enough to investigate the company's problems, Mr. Nadler said.    In addition, Par and its Quad unit recently pleaded guilty to one count of providing an unlawful gratuity to an FDA employee.    A former Par senior vice president, Ashok Patel, and Dilip P. Shah, former president of Quad, each pleaded guilty to a related charge. They each face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $250,000 fine.    The U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore is heading a federal grand-jury probe into corruption within the FDA and the generic-drug industry. So far, three FDA employees have pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and additional charges are expected to be brought next month against both FDA and company officials, federal investigators have said.    Before Par's most recent disclosure, the company announced that it had filed false data with the FDA, recalling one of its drugs and stopping sales on two others. The company's recalled drug is its version of Maxzide, a blood-pressure medicine pioneered by Mylan Laboratories Inc.    Mr. Nadler said the company believes it may receive clearance from the FDA as early as today or Monday to resume shipping products.    While the FDA's Mr. Nesbit confirmed that the agency is reviewing a request by Par to resume distribution, he said, &quot;It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the outcome of that review.&quot; It is unclear whether the company would be allowed to start distributing all 150 products again or just some of them.    Mr. Nadler said Par didn't issue a formal statement about the suspension of shipments &quot;because it isn't as drastic as it appears.&quot; He said the suspension was necessary to ensure that all the company's products &quot;are what they're supposed to be . . . that they're okay.&quot; Mr. Nadler said that neither the FDA nor the company's own investigation by a special review committee so far had turned up any evidence of health and safety issues related to Par's drugs.    In its SEC filing, Par said it &quot;recently became aware of irregularities in certain of its records relating to production and product development. Certain of these matters were discovered by Par in connection with an FDA inspection of its manufacturing facilities, while others were disclosed by Par's regular quality assurance procedures.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Par closed at $5.375, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
