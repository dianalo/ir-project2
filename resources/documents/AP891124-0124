It was the latest in a series of acts by President F.W. de Klerkaimed at reducing racial friction in South Africa.   The far-right Conservative Party, which favors rigidsegregation, condemned the decision.   ``Mr. de Klerk ignores the existence of ... white community lifeand draws a line through the traditional way of life and ideals bywhich whites have lived for centuries in this country,'' said J.H.van der Merwe, a member of Parliament for the Conservatives.   ``The Conservative Party warns Mr. de Klerk once again urgentlynot to try to suppress the ability of whites to resist.''   De Klerk, who assumed office in August, said he favors selectedmultiracial neighborhoods but will maintain segregated schools andresidential districts for whites who want them.   The four newly integrated neighborhoods are District Six in CapeTown; a downtown section in the Indian Ocean city of Durban; athinly populated suburban area between Johannesburg and Pretoria;and a small part of Boksburg, an industrial city east ofJohannesburg.   De Klerk on Thursday proclaimed that people of any race may ownbusinesses in Boksburg, overruling the council's effort to restrictownership to whites.   Anti-apartheid activists said opening only small ``freesettlement areas'' will lead to overcrowding due to the acutehousing shortage in black townships nationwide.   ``While welcoming any move away from racially zoned areas, wecannot admit to being ecstatic,'' said Cas Coovadia of Actstop, agroup that has fought residential segregation.   Coovadia said the move was an attempt to amend, rather thanrepeal, the Group Areas Act, which has formally segregated allneighborhoods by race since 1950.   District Six, within walking distance of downtown Cape Town, wasa ragged but lively multiracial neighborhood until the governmentdeclared it a ``whites-only'' area in 1966 and renamed itZonnebloem. About 40,000 non-whites were forced out and all thebuildings were razed except for churches and mosques.   So deep is the bitterness created by the evictions that few CapeTown whites or businesses have sought any part of the area, and itremains an empty field.   The multiracial Durban neighborhood is made up mostly of aging,downtown apartment buildings where some blacks already live.   The area between Johannesburg and Durban has few residents butis expected to become a middle-class development.   Boksburg has drawn international attention since the far-rightConservative Party won control of the town council last year andbegan reimposing strict apartheid.   The neighborhood that will be open to all races has fewer than50 houses and many already are owned by Indian families.   In another development Friday, a whites-only public school forgirls that faced closure because it had too few students willbecome a multiracial private school, officials said.   Education officials this year said they planned to close the102-year-old Johannesburg Girls High School because enrollmentdropped to 200 students, or one-third of capacity.   Teachers, parents and students launched a campaign to keep theschool open and said they would welcome black and Indian studentsto help increase enrollment.</TEXT></DOC>
