The options being considered include making permanent thetemporary import ban on a variety of semi-automatic assault riflesthat was imposed in March and increasing criminal penalties forillegal use of firearms, according to one of two sources, who bothspoke on condition of anonymity.   The administration is also studying increased penalties for theillegal possession of semi-automatic weapons and their use in thecommission of crimes, according to another source.   The proposals are in the final stages of review by White Housedomestic policy chief Roger Porter. The anti-crime legislativepackage is expected to be unveiled Monday by the president.   Under consideration is a proposal that would bar peoplesentenced to at least six months in jail for misdeanors frompurchasing guns, said the second source. Federal law currently bansconvicted felons from owning guns.   Another measure under consideration is a proposal to link gundealers to a federal registry to determine if weapons purchasersare convicted criminals, the second source said.   Public concern about the use of military-style assault weapons,such as the AK-47 used by a gunman to kill five children in aStockton, Calif. schoolyard last January, has prompted theadministration review of gun-control policies.   In March, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms imposed atemporary import ban on a variety of foreign-made semi-automaticassault weapons while the agency determines if any of them arebeing used for legitimate sporting purposes.   Federal law prevents the importation of such weapons unless theyare used for target shooting or hunting.   One of the options under consideration is a plan to permanentlyban 15 foreign and domestic-made military-style assault weapons,the source said.</TEXT></DOC>
