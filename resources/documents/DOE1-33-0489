A new complex has been synthesized, [/sup 99m/Tc(DEPE)2(CNR)2],+(DEPIC), where R = t - butyl isocyanide, which in three animal speciesimages the myocardium very well, but in humans it remains primarily inthe blood pool. One reason for the difference in the behavior of thesecomplexes in different species could be the characteristics of theirbinding to plasma proteins. The protein binding characteristics of DEPICand two other well-known complexes have therefore been studied. Whereasthe other complexes bind nonspecifically to many proteins both in animaland human plasma, DEPIC binds almost exclusively to prealbumin in humansbut nonspecifically to other proteins in the rabbit. The binding sitesin human plasma appear to be those normally occupied by thyroxine onthe prealbumin tetramer and these can be blocked by sodium salicylate.</TEXT></DOC>
