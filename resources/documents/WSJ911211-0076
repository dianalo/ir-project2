Shell Canada Ltd., 78%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Groupsaid yesterday that it filed a suit claiming Pacific Gas andtwo of its units -- pipeline concern Pacific Gas TransmissionLtd. and Alberta andamp; Southern Gas Co., a gas procurementconcern -- failed to buy minimum amounts of natural gas underlong-term supply contracts. The complaint, which seeks aboutC$70 million (US$61.6 million) in damages and a rulingordering the utility to meet its contractual obligations,follows a similar action in September by Amoco CanadaPetroleum Co. Ltd., a unit of Amoco Corp.; industry sourcessay they expect several more suits to be filed in the comingdays and weeks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This puts {Pacific Gas} squarely on the firing line inthis battle,&quot; said Richard Hillary, an industry consultant inCalgary. &quot;The producers, Pacific Gas -- they're the meat inthe sandwich, and they're being squeezed.&quot;   The suits are part and parcel of the increasingly heateddebate over the terms under which Canadian gas producers areto supply California about C$1 billion of natural gasannually.   The California Public Utilities Commission believes thatconsumers in the state are paying too much for the long-termsupplies purchased from a pool of 190 Canadian producers,including Shell and Amoco. It has pointed to very low pricesfor short-term supplies of gas in Alberta and elsewhere.   Following acrimonious negotiations last summer on theprice of gas to be delivered under the contracts toCalifornia in the current year, the CPUC decided in earlyNovember to order Pacific Gas to drop its longstandingcontracts with the Alberta supply pool as of Oct. 1, 1992.Producers and the governments of Alberta and Canada reactedwith outrage to what they perceived as the unilateralabrogation of the contracts, with the Canadian governmentconsidering a complaint under the provisions of itsfree-trade agreement with the U.S.   Scott Woroniuk, executive assistant to Alberta's ministerof energy, Rick Orman, said the province simply wants theproducers and the utility to reach a new gas supply pactwithout regulatory interference. But he said the CPUC&quot;doesn't appear to have much faith in the ability of theparties to resolve this themselves . . . so they're tiltingthe table to the benefit of one group of participants {theconsumers}.&quot;   The CPUC has said it believes there is ample time forproducers and Pacific Gas to reach agreement on ways torestructure the 30-year supply relationship, even though thecurrent contract arrangements were originally set to continueuntil 1994. Canada supplies about half the gas needs ofPacific Gas.   Industry sources say other Canadian producers are expectedto take legal action against Pacific Gas. A spokesman forGulf Canada Resources Ltd. of Calgary said that it isexamining a lawsuit as one way of resolving the dispute withPacific Gas and the CPUC.   Spokesmen for Pacific Gas and its Alberta andamp; Southern unitdeclined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
