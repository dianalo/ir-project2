Data from both stations were taken during the solar minimumperiod 1975-1976. The equivalent slab thickness, the ratio TEC/N(max)also indicated similar F region profile shape in the two longitude sectors.The standard deviation of equatorial daytime TEC is significantly smallerthan at other latitudes. 20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
