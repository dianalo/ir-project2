The mechanisms by which plants acquire,transport and utilize essential mineral nutrients are highly complex.The means by which plants either exclude or tolerate ions of metals toxicto them are equally complex. This book has papers on genetic and breedingresearch. It also includes biotic interactions under genetic controlthat either enhanced or impeded ion uptake, e.g., mycorrhizae and nitrogenfixing bacteria.</TEXT></DOC>
