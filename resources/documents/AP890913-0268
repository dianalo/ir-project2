DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two partners in the accounting giant Coopers andamp;Lybrand say they will appeal an order barring them from practicingbefore the Securities and Exchange Commission for the next fiveyears.   An administrative judge, in a ruling announced Tuesday, foundDavid J. Checkosky and Norman A. Aldrich had engaged in ``blatant,serious'' unprofessional conduct.   Following 30 days of hearings, 13 witnesses and 350 exhibits, theadministrative judge ruled in favor of the SEC, which claimedCheckosky and Aldrich violated generally accepted standards ofauditing and principles of accounting in audits their firm did forSavin Corp., which markets copy machines.   Financial information provided in the audits ``portrayed thecompany as a far more successful business enterprise than it was,''according to the judge's ruling.   ``It's fair to characterize the judge's decision as outrageous,''said Geoffrey F. Aronow, an attorney for both men, who worked inCoopers andamp; Lybrand's Stamford, Conn. headquarters.   Aronow accused the Administrative Judge Brenda P. Murray of ofignoring ``large portions of the evidence in the record'' and saidshe ``has misapplied the applicable auditing principles andmisconstrued the underlying regulatory legal standards that applyhere.''   He said his clients ``intend to appeal to the commission andbelieve the propriety of their actions will ultimately bevindicated.''   There were no allegations of wrongdoing against Savin in the SECaction, but several investors lawsuits are pending in Connecticut.   A spokesman for Coopers andamp; Lybrand was not available for comment.   Savin has been a client of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, one of the nation'slargest accounting firms, since the mid-1960s.   The judge noted that annual billings from Savin totaled about$340,000.   ``For professional reasons, it was important to both men that theclient be pleased with their efforts. Unfortunately, pleasing theclient became their paramount consideration,'' she wrote in a68-page opinion.   Checkosky and Aldrich were the senior people assigned to theSavin audits in question, for fiscal years 1981 through 1984.Savin's fiscal year ran from May 1 to April 30.   The SEC charged, among other things, that the two partners didnot adequately plan the audits; did not ``exercise due care'' inexamining Savin financial statements and did not obtain sufficientcredible evidence to back up the opinions they submitted in SECdocuments.   According to the judge's finding, the partners wrongly claimed itwas proper to defer as start-up costs the costs Savin incurred indeveloping a new copier.   She found the SEC's evidence persuasive that during the timecovered by the audits, Savin should have listed its costs asresearch and development expenses.   By deferring rather than expensing, Savin kept these costs fromincreasing its net operating loss during the period in question.Instead these costs were included as assets on Savin's balance sheetand increased owners' equity.</TEXT></DOC>
