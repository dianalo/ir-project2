The Council may also consider the advice of its ShrimpAdvisory Panel regarding the findings.When the sanctuary was partially opened in 1983-1984, NMFS determined thatharvestable populations of shrimp occur periodically within a small portionof the sanctuary_a fact strongly supported by public testimony. Fishermencontend that shrimp from within this portion of the sanctuary emigrateto untrawlable areas and are unavailable to the fishery. Poor recruitmentof shrimp to the Tortugas fishery has resulted in 2 consecutive years ofpoor production and economic loss to the adjacent shrimp ports. As identifiedin the FMP, poor recruitment in this unique fishery is more a functionof environmental forces than of overfishing. Opening the area of the sanctuarycontaining all sizes of shrimp is consistent with optimum yield becauseit will allow shrimpers to obtain, on a temporary basis, a more valuablecatch per unit of effort. Thus, the Regional Director, after consulting with the Council and consideringthe criteria for modifying the sanctuary, has determined that the smallportion of the sanctuary that periodically contains harvestable shrimpshould be opened for 90 days. This area is less than 10 percent of thetotal geographical scope of the sanctuary and such modification will increasethe benefits by optimizing the yield of shrimp recruited to the fishery.This temporary geographic modification is consistent with Objective 1 ofthe FMP because it provides temporary economic relief to the stressed fishermenwhile continuing to optimize the yield of shrimp recruited to the fishery.To maximize its intended economic benefits, this rule should be implementedon November 1, 1988, or as soon thereafter as possible. November 1 marksthe onset of the 6-month period when peak landings occur. Due to the timeconsumed by preparation of the Biological Opinion regarding potential impactsof the proposed rule on endangered and threatened sea turtles, the normalAdministrative Procedure Act requirement for publication of proposed regulationscannot be followed if the proposed opening is to occur in a timely andeffective manner. NOAA finds that it is both impracticable and againstthe public interest to publish proposed regulations and receive publiccomment at this time. For this reason, a final rule is being promulgatedto remain in effect for 90 days. NOAA also finds that opening a portionof the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary to trawl fishing has the effect of relievinga restriction, and, therefore, NOAA is waiving the normal AdministrativeProcedure Act requirement for delayed effectiveness after publication ofthis final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Impacts </ITAG>The modification of the geographic size of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuaryis considered to be a ``federal action'' under the Endangered Species Act(ESA). Therefore, consultation under section 7 of the ESA is required toensure that such action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existenceof any endangered or threatened species or result in the adverse modificationof the critical habitat of such species. A Biological Opinion is then writtenthat concludes whether or not the proposed activity is likely to jeopardizesuch species or adversely affect their habitat. When any Federal actionmay incidentally take listed species, NOAA Fisheries must issue a statementin the Biological Opinion that specifies the impact (amount or extent)of such taking and the terms and conditions that must be followed to reducesuch impact. Only incidental taking by the Federal agency or applicantthat complies with the specified terms and conditions of this statementis authorized and exempt from the taking prohibition of the ESA. NOAA Fisheries has written a Biological Opinion which establishes two conditionson the incidental take of sea turtles in the Tortugas sanctuary: (1) If an endangered or threatened sea turtle is encountered in a shrimptrawl, the sea turtle resuscitation procedures and release techniques establishedfor threatened sea turtles must be followed (50 CFR 227.72(e)(1)). (2) If sea turtles are encountered, a report giving the date of take andan account of the status of each turtle must be provided to NOAA Fisherieson return to port after each fishing trip. The Biological Opinion also contains a note that there are regulationswhich require the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) and other conservationmeasures in certain areas and at certain times. The implementation of theseregulations has been delayed by Congress until May 1, 1989. At that time,the regulations will become effective for the opened portion of the Tortugassanctuary as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Anticipated Extension of the Temporary Geographic Modification andImplementation of the Reporting Requirement Contained in the BiologicalOpinionThis emergency action will be effective for 90 days. The Biological Opinionfor this action requires that a report must be provided in order for individualfishermen to be exempt from the taking prohibitions of the ESA wheneverthey incidentally take a sea turtle in the opened portion of the Tortugassanctuary. This report constitutes a collection-of-information requirementsubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request is being prepared forsubmission to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Since itis impracticable to satisfy the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct and the ESA in a timely manner, this geographic modification is effectiveonly for 90 days. As soon as possible during this period, the temporarygeographic modification established by this emergency rule will be extendedand the reporting requirement will be implemented through a notice of proposedrulemaking, giving interested persons an opportunity to comment, and afinal rule.In the meantime, a fisherman fishing for shrimp in the opened portion ofthe Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, who incidentally takes a Kemp's ridley,hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, or green turtle, can avoid violatingthe ESA restrictions on takings of these species by making a voluntaryreport of that take and following the resuscitation procedures. A voluntaryreport should give the date of take and an account of the status of eachturtle and should be provided to: Director, Galveston Laboratory, NOAAFisheries, Avenue U, Galveston, Texas 77550, on return to port after eachfishing trip. Reporting forms, sea turtle identification guides, and resuscitationtechniques are available from the Director, Galveston Laboratory.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (Assistant Administrator),has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency andthat it is consistent with the national standards and other provisionsof the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.The Assistant Administrator finds that notice and opportunity for publiccomment are impracticable and contrary to the public interest pursuantto section 553(b)(B) because of the necessity of conducting a Section 7Consultation under the ESA and completing a Biological Opinion while alsoproviding timely economic relief to a segment of the shrimp industry. Becausethis is a substantive rule which relieves a restriction, the AssistantAdministrator also finds that it is not necessary to delay its effectivedate for 30 days, pursuant to the provision of section 553(d)(1) of theAdministrative Procedure Act.Because of the emergency need for implementation of this rule as soon aspossible after November 1, 1988, it is exempt from the normal review proceduresof E.O. 12291, as provided in section 8(a)(1) of that order. This ruleis being reported to the Director of the Office of Management and Budgetwith an explanation of why it is not possible to follow the proceduresof that order.This rule is exempt from the procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Actbecause it is issued without opportunity for prior public comments.The Council prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this rule and,based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator concluded that there willbe no significant impact on the human environment as a result of this rule.Copies of the EA are available (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).This rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement andtherefore is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Florida. This determination was submitted forreview by Florida under section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.Florida failed to comment within the statutory time period and concurrenceis therefore implied.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 658</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 4, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
