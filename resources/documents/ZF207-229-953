 BY SALVATORE PARASCANDOLOandM;In nature, knowing the subtle distinctions of the markings of snakes can meanthe difference between life and death -- the same principle applies to yourcomputer's cables.andP;  Equipment cables are neither as innocent nor as standardas they appear.andP;  For them, the paradox ``same but different'' actuallyapplies.andP;  Two cables that look the same don't necessarily do the same things.andO;Under the circumstances, the best course is to be completely paranoid.andM;When buying from a mail-order house, be certain and specific about yourneeds.andP;  If your purchase includes a cable, find out which Macintoshes thecable will fit.andP;  With computer cables, as with snakes, a little priorknowledge can be a lifesaver.andP;  CABLE CONSCIOUSNESSandM;Typical cables have from 2 to 50 small wires running through them, and eachwire can carry electrical power, data pulses called signals, or nothing.andO;Many times, only a few of the cable's available wires are actually used.andO;Devices, such as your computer or printer have ports to which various cablesconnect.andP;  The size and shape of a port and how signals flow in and outdetermine the kind of cable you'll need.andP;  If the business end of a port orcable connector shows rows of holes,  or sockets, it's a female.andP;  If it hasrows of pins, it's a male.andP;  Each pin or socket of a cable connector islabeled with a number that usually appears on the plastic wall in which it'sembedded.andP;  When discussing what's connected to what, we call connectorpositions pins  regardless of whether they're male or female.andM;Equipment cables aren't usually wired so that a given pin at one end isconnected to the corresponding pin at the other end.andP;  Connector shapes orgenders can also be deceiving.andP;  Some cables can fit in totally inappropriateports.andP;  Without a testing device and wiring charts, you'd never know whatgoes where, or whether it was right or not.andP;  If you intend to build, adapt,or test cables yourself, it's imperative to have pin-out charts, whichdescribe which wire carries which message.andP;  GAIN THROUGH CABLEandM;The prime concern, and mandatory final check when making cables, is to ensurethat the two ends of a cable are connected like the book says.andP;  To saveyourself countless hours of frustration, invest the time to check severaltimes every step and every bit of information you read.andP;  Even then, questionyour own assuredness.andP;  For some hookups, this pin-out research will takelonger than the actual construction.andM;Equipment usually comes with pin-out charts.andP;  If you can, compare the chartsthat come with any two devices that you wish to connect.andP;  Get supportinginformation from several sources like connectivity literature (see thesidebar ``Parts and Charts'') and manufacturers.andP;  Some diagrams may refer tothe same signal name differently and may even depict subtly different pinconnections -- some of which may be harmless, or functionally identical, andsome of which may be outdated or simply wrong.andM;Be especially careful of how you identify a connector's or port's pins.andO;Referring to the charts in this article, you'll notice that the male andfemale versions have their pins numbered in reverse order.andP;  Looking squareinto the face of a male connector, the upper left pin is number 1.andP;  On thefemale connector, that's pin 13.andP;  When wiring,  go strictly by pin numbers,and not by relative location.andP;  Some wiring diagrams show the connectionsviewed from the back of the connector, which can easily confuse you into abackward hookup.andP;  Luckily, most crossed-signal errors for printers and modemsaren't harmful (although shorting power to ground can be damaging).andP;  SHE WOREA RIBBON CABLEandM;A ribbon cable has its wires arranged side-by-side, like lanes on a highway.andO;It's great for tool-free construction, because it needs no solder.andP;  Instead,you use special connectors that press on, cutting through the insulation, andremain solidly and reliablyandM;mounted.andP;   The ribbon can be flexed and routed easily, unlike someandM;conventional cable that can be as flexible as an aqueduct.andP;  Connections caneven be undone and rearranged with your bare hands, although occasionallyyou'll also need a common tool, like a vise.andM;Because of its relative position in the ribbon, a wire is easy to trace.andP;  Butbe careful: Ribbon cable wires are not sequentially numbered.andP;  Instead, thewires are interleaved horizontally, just like a connector's.andP;  For example, ona 25-conductor cable, the wires read like this: 1, 14, 2, 15, 3, 16, 4, 17,and so on until 13, 25.andP;  With reasonable care, ribbon cable connectors willautomatically align their pins with their corresponding wires.andP;  Just makesure that the ribbon end is trimmed square, enters at a right angle, and isnot scrunched to one side of the insertion slot.andM;Pressing 25 or 36 or 50 wires in place requires considerable force.andP;  The bestmethod is to squeeze the connector in a vise.andP;  If you haven't got a vise, youcan lay a wood block or a book on the assembly and use a second block or bookto tap the unit together.andM;You can put any number of connectors anywhere along a length of ribbon cable,as long as there's space.andP;  You can even move or remove a connector with noill effects.andP;  This enables you to make gender changers, extenders, splicers,adapters with different ends, Y- adapters for hooking up multiple devices toone Mac, or one cable that fits several devices, each with a differentconnector, pin-out, or gender.andM;Unfortunately, ribbon cable isn't shielded.andP;  That's of little consequence forserial connections to modems and printers, but an external SCSI ribbon cablemight produce significant noise in computer peripherals or in household radioand TV receivers -- and not necessarily in your own house.andP;  Slip-on shieldsare available, but you can make one for a lot less by simply wrapping thecable in aluminum foil and connecting it with a short wire to any cableconnector  screw hole on the Mac.andM;For special hook-ups, or if you have 25-wire ribbon cable and plan to use9-pin connectors, you can cleanly strip away the unneeded wires.andP;  Specialconnectors can also accept the inner wires of flat telephone cable, which ischeap, reliable, and compact.andP;  Long cables for  modems and printers,extensions, or adapters can be made this way.andP;  True, some of the homemadejobs look messy, but I've used such cables and adapters for several yearswithout a problem.andP;  WIRED ON HEAVY METALandM;For soldered cables, you'll need connectors of the proper shape and gender,cable with at least as many wires as your equipment demands, rosin coreelectronic solder, and a set of connector shells (or substitutes) forenclosing your handiwork at each end.andM;In addition, you'll also  need needle-nose pliers, one or more needles, pins,or thin, stiff wire to reach the inside sockets of female connectors forcontinuity tests, a low-wattage pencil-tipped soldering iron, or gun,desoldering braid, and a holding tool like a vise, locking pliers, a clamp, aclip, or even adhesive tape.andM;You can check a connection in one of four basic ways: by actually using thefinished cable; by using an ohmmeter, which measures resistance between twopoints (zero resistance is a good connection); by using an inexpensivelight-the-bulb tester; or by using a 9-volt battery, some wire, and yourtongue.andP;  The latter method is illustrated in Figure 6.andM;Strip about 14 inch of insulation off each wire and lightly coat the exposedends with solder.andP;  Also apply solder to troughs on the wire side of theconnector's pins.andP;  For each connection, heat the pin and simultaneouslyinsert its wire into the trough, then let the connection cool.andP;  Don't begenerous with the solder, or you'll inadvertently bridge some pins, whichmight corrupt the connection and turn your equipment into a toaster oven.andM;If you don't have a shell for your connectors, you can fabricate your own byencasing the wired pins with silicone rubber or five- minute epoxy.andP;  Beforeyou start sliming, though, protect the business end of the connector bywrapping it with tape.andP;  The finished product is rather permanent, so beforeyou encase everything in epoxy, make dead sure that your cable works.andP;  WIREYOU HEREandM;If you can't get the proper connectors, you can make a special cable from asuitable spare by rearranging its connections -- not at the ends, but in themiddle.andP;  Just cut into the outer sheath to expose all the available wires,and reconnect them as needed -- either by soldering or twisting.andP;  You caneven combine two cables, each with a valuable end, into an electroniclifeline.andP;  Even if a cable's connectors are molded on, you can map thepin-to-wire connections with a continuity checker.andP;  PULLING THE PLUGandM;With new devices introduced so frequently, the world of cables remains asnake pit.andP;  Monitor cables seem to be the worst at consistency of pin-outsand connector types, and nearly require a dedicated book.andP;  The basic checkingand construction tips in this article apply to just about any cable.andP;  We doapologize that the pin- outs for connecting a 12-cup Mr. Coffee to aLaserWriter NTX just didn't reach us in time.andP;  SALVATORE PARASCANDOLO IS ASENIOR STAFF WRITER WHO ONCE MADE A  CABLE SO COMPLEX THAT NO SIGNALS EVERFOUND THEIR WAY OUT OF IT.andP;  Adopting Adept Adaptersyou can use theselifesavers to change the gender of a connector, convert 25-pin to 9-pininterfaces, or  reroute the signals to a different pin layout.andP;  If you do alot of  traveling, you should keep several with you.andP;  A well-stocked arsenalshould include: a DB-9 to mini DIN-8 for adapting your Mac Plus, SE, or II tocables for equipment originally designed for the Mac 128, 512K, and 512KE; aDB-9 to DB-25 modem cable for Hayes and  compatibles; a Mac to DB-25 serialprinter cable, which can also serve as a communications link between a Macand PC-type computer; and,  finally, a DB-25 gender changer for the odd modemor printer that's got matching pin-outs but the wrong gender.andM;There's even a serial cable that can adjust itself for the job.andP;  It's calledthe SmartCable, and it's made by IQ Technologies.andP;  You can use it with aprinter, modem, computer link, and  equipment with various pin-outs; and itwill configure itself electronically.andP;  But for most non-Apple-compatibleprinters, a cable alone is not enough.andP;  You'll also need the appropriateprinter driver.andP;  You may be able to get the driver you need from the printermanufacturer, but if not, SoftStyle sells a variety of drivers, includingthose for Epson, Toshiba, IBM, HP LaserJet, and some popular daisywheelprinters.andP;  Parts and Chartsyou can find cables and cable components byreading the ads from mail-order houses and specialized suppliers throughoutMacUser.andP;  You should also have pretty good luck at any local computer dealerthat carries a variety of hardware.andP;  They usually have ready- made cables formost standard needs.andP;  Some common and even rare tools, parts, and cables canbe found at your local Radio Shack or an electronics hobby shop.andP;  IQTechnologies 11811 N.E.andP;
