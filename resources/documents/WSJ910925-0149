Would it be onaffirmative action? Abortion? No, instead:   &quot;There is a whole new school of thought in America,&quot; Sen.Biden said, whose members &quot;want to heighten the protectionfor business and corporations. . . . One of these people is aProf. Macedo, a fine first-class scholar at HarvardUniversity. Another is Mr. Epstein, a professor at theUniversity of Chicago. And in a speech you gave in 1987 tothe Pacific Research Institute, you said, `I find attractivethe arguments of scholars such as Stephen Macedo, who defendan activist Supreme Court that would,' not could, `strikedown laws restricting property rights.'</LP><TEXT>   &quot;My question is a very simple one, Judge. What exactly doyou find attractive about the arguments of Prof. Macedo andother scholars like him?&quot;   Suddenly, the arcane subject of constitutional economicliberties became Confirmation Topic A. Despite the bestefforts of these editorial pages, it must be conceded thatRichard Epstein is not a household name. When Mr. Biden laterwaved a copy of Mr. Epstein's 1985 book, &quot;Takings: PrivateProperty and the Power of Eminent Domain,&quot; the publicists atthe Harvard University Press were ecstatic, and Mr. Macedowrote Mr. Biden asking for 15 minutes of fame for his booktoo.   Mr. Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, isno fan of property rights, an attitude that might be called anatural law for politicians. There is &quot;a new, fervent area ofscholarship that basically says: Hey, look, we, themodern-day court, have not taken enough time to protectpeople's property, the property rights of corporations, theproperty rights of individuals,&quot; Mr. Biden said, so &quot;we haveto elevate that to make it harder for governments tointerfere.&quot;   Yes, Mr. Biden, there is a Takings Clause -- and it's notnew. This part of the Fifth Amendment (and similar provisionsin state constitutions) prohibits the government from takingprivate property except for a public purpose and then only iffair compensation is paid. &quot;Were Mr. Epstein's views to takeplace, it would be a multimillion-dollar expense for thetaxpayers,&quot; Mr. Biden said, &quot;if they wanted to continue toregulate the way we now regulate.&quot;   If. If the Takings Clause were strictly enforced, iftaxpayers had to compensate owners for their losses, then itwould be a safe bet we'd have many fewer property-takingregulations. Taxpayers simply wouldn't want to pay the price.The Takings Clause was designed as a key limit on the size ofgovernment. As Mr. Epstein says, &quot;What we call rent-seeking,the Founders called factions.&quot;   Mr. Biden criticized Judge Thomas for a speech where hesaid in the Constitution, property rights &quot;are as protectedas much as any other right.&quot; Mr. Biden huffed that &quot;economicrights now are not protected as much as any other rights.&quot;This is thanks to FDR's threat to pack the Supreme Courtunless the justices sacrificed economic liberties to the NewDeal.   Mr. Biden told Judge Thomas that &quot;the single mostimportant question you can be asked in this entire hearing&quot;is the level of protection property rights should get. JudgeThomas refused to give extended answers, but reminded thesenators that he criticized Mr. Macedo for a judicialactivism that went beyond original intent.   Judge Thomas did, however, insist that the Takings Clauseexists. He also hinted that he understands &quot;property&quot; toinclude labor. &quot;Something that troubled me even in my youth,if you ended slavery and you had black codes, for example, oryou had laws that did not allow my grandfather to enjoy thefruits of his labor, prevented him from working,&quot; he said,&quot;by what theory do you protect that?&quot;   Jim Crow laws were possible because courts failed toenforce the rights of blacks to their labor. Arbitrarydenials of licenses were so common that Judge Thomas said hisgrandfather &quot;literally had to get a drink before he went tothe licensing bureau in Savannah to get the license that heneeded to drive his oil truck.&quot;   Several recent opinions by Justice Antonin Scalia havebegun to revitalize property rights. Possible constitutionalchallenges are endless. The Davis-Bacon law, which prohibitsworkers from accepting less than the prevailing union wage ongovernment contracts, is a modern version of licensing laws.Rent control survives even though it takes from landlords andgives to often middle-class tenants. The Founders would beamazed by wetlands regulations; the government should, butdoesn't, compensate property owners when new rules reclassifyusable land as off-limits wetlands.   Mr. Biden raised another issue close to conservativehearts and minds. &quot;The intellectual ferment on the right,&quot; hesaid, is among &quot;those people who have two major items ontheir agenda and they state them very forthrightly.&quot; One isto use the Takings Clause &quot;to limit the power of society toregulate,&quot; Mr. Biden said, &quot;and the other is to limit thepower of society to regulate by revitalizing the doctrine ofseparation of powers.&quot;   This helps explain the attention in the hearings toMorrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court case that upheld theconstitutionality of special prosecutors. In a speech, JudgeThomas called this case the &quot;most important&quot; since Brown v.Board of Education. He disagreed with the result in Morrisonand praised Justice Scalia's dissent that the Constitutiononly allows three branches of government, not &quot;independent&quot;prosecutors. Justice Scalia stressed that politicallyunaccountable prosecutors are likely to violate the civilliberties of their targets. Judge Thomas didn't have to domuch explaining the week that Lawrence Walsh finally droppedhis abusive prosecution of Oliver North.   Still, Mr. Biden referred to those &quot;who thought if theycould get the court to strike down the independent-counselstatute, they would have a basis for striking down allindependent agencies&quot; -- the constitutionally dubious fourthbranch of government. Mr. Biden understood the issue wellenough to say that the Securities and Exchange Commission,Federal Trade Commission and Federal CommunicationsCommission were at special risk from strict adherence toseparation of powers.   &quot;If there were five Justice Scalias on the bench, we wouldfind ourselves with a radically different means by which wewould be able to have this government function,&quot; Mr. Bidensaid. Judge Thomas, who as an executive-branch officialcalled Congress a place of &quot;little deliberation and even lesswisdom,&quot; said he had no special agenda here either.   Mr. Biden most likely brought up the previously arcanesubjects of property rights and separation of powers in thehopes of tripping up the Thomas nomination. Whatever thereason, at least Mr. Biden elevated these issues. Mr. Bidenis also probably right to be worried. Don't be too surprisedif when these cases reach the Supreme Court, Justice Thomasindeed becomes the second Justice Scalia.</TEXT></DOC>
