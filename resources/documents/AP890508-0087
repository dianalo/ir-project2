But researcher Cynthia Pfeffer stressed that the approach needsfurther study and that results of her research provide ``just aglimmer'' that the test may be useful.   Pfeffer, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at theCornell University Medical College, spoke in an interview beforepresenting the study Monday at the annual meeting of the AmericanPsychiatric Association.   Each year about 100 to 200 suicides occur among children age 10to 14, a rate of about one per 100,000 children, writes PaulHolinger, of the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center inChicago, in the newly published book ``Suicide Among Youth:Perspectives On Risk And Prevention.''   Thousands of other children in that age group attempt suicideeach year, said Herbert Hendin, executive director of the AmericanSuicide Foundation in New York.   Pfeffer's research, done with colleagues at Cornell and atColumbia University in New York, involved 51 child patients inpsychiatric hospital.   The average age of the children was about 11. Within about sixmonths before admission to a hospital, three children had madeserious suicide attempts, 10 made mild attempts, 12 threatenedsuicide and 14 had suicidal ideas. Ten others were not suicidal,and the status of two could not be determined.   The blood test focused on a hormone called cortisol. The hormoneis involved with the neuroendocrine system, which is part of thehormonal system regulated by the brain, Pfeffer said. So cortisolmeasurements may be able to reveal abnormalities in that system,she said.   Some previous studies have linked cortisol abnormalities todepression, stress and suicide in adults and adolescents, butlittle research on cortisol and suicide has been done in children.   In Pfeffer's study, researchers measured cortisol levels in theblood, and also performed a procedure called the dexamethasonesuppression test. Patients were given a substance calleddexamethasone to see if it made their bodies produce less cortisol.   In most people, dexamethasone will lower their cortisol levels.But others, including some depressed patients, do not show thatresponse.   The children in the study were tested within two weeks ofadmission to the hospital, and again seven weeks after admission.   Researchers found that children whose cortisol levels were notsuppressed by the dexamethasone in the initial test tended to havemore serious suicidal thoughts at the seven-week point than theothers did. Seriousness of the thoughts was ranked by such factorsas whether the child had a plan for suicide and whether the planwas worked out in detail.   Researchers also found higher natural cortisol levels at theseven-week point in children who showed suicidal behavior orthoughts both at that time and upon hospital admission, than inchildren who had shown such suicidal tendencies only in the firsttest. So children with persistent suicidal tendencies averagedhigher cortisol levels, Pfeffer said.   The study's results suggest the approach deserves furtherresearch, but it is too soon to tell what the usefulness ofcortisol testing might be, Michael Stanley of the New York StatePsychiatric Institute said in an interview.   Herbert Meltzer, psychiatry professor at the Case WesternReserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, said children should befollowed for a longer period to see how well the experimental testpredicts suicidal behavior.   He also noted that only three children in the study had madeserious suicide attempts before hospitalization.   But because the study results were consistent with findings inadults, the new work suggests that research about the biology ofsuicide in adults also may apply to children, he said.   Meltzer cautioned, however, that the new results are limitedbecause researchers evidently did not measure the amount ofdexamethasone in the blood when cortisol suppression was measured.People differ significantly in how much dexamethasone stays in theblood and that should be taken into account, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
