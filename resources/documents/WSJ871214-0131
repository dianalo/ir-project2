But U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz declined to say at a news conference Saturday whether he had told EC Commission President Jacques Delors of any U.S. plan to stem the dollar's slide or to take measures to trim the trade deficit.    Mr. Shultz called on Europe and Japan to adjust their economies to help curb trade imbalances. &quot;Those countries living off their trade surpluses will have to do some restructuring,&quot; he said.    Nonetheless, the talks were marked by an easing of trade tensions, in contrast with the course of relations in previous years. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the two sides were handling trade relations &quot;as well as at any other time&quot; in recent memory. But he warned of &quot;additional confrontation&quot; if no progress was made on farm issues that are &quot;on the front burner.&quot;    Officials also cited progress toward settling a dispute over subsidies from EC governments to Airbus Industrie, which groups four European aircraft builders. EC External Affairs Commissioner Willy De Clercq said he was &quot;rather optimistic&quot; and that the two sides would hold a ministerial meeting as early as February.    Mr. Yeutter cautioned, however, that the EC and the U.S. still have &quot;fundamental differences {on Airbus} and it won't be easy to bridge that gap.&quot;    EC foreign ministers will meet today to discuss trade relations with Japan and the U.S., as well as emergency safety standards for radiation in food. </TEXT></DOC>
