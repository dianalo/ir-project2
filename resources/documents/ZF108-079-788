 Support for X windows allowsterminal users to run a number of applications on multiple hostssimultaneously, a capability that blurs distinctions between graphicsterminals and low-end workstations.andM;There are still many high-resolution terminals that don't support X windows.andO;Although these devices have undergone few significant changes in the pastyear and have maintained steady prices, they remain viable alternatives forbuyers who don't require the multiple host access that X windows provides.andM;The X Window System isn't freebie--support for the protocol generallyincreases a high-resolution graphics terminal's price.andM;There are two points worth noting in this regard, however.andP;  First, marketanalysts expect X terminal prices to decrease steadily over the next fewyears.andP;  Second, buyers might want to buy X terminals today as a just-in-caseinvestment.andP;  As the era of connectivity enters its second decade, few buyerscan afford to ignore the possibility that one day they might want to access avariety of graphics tools running in heterogeneous network computingenvironments.andM;It's too early to assess the impact and popularity of these X terminals, butif vendors' and market analysts' predictions prove accurate, high-resolutiongraphics terminals that support X windows will bring sophisticated andcompetitively priced graphics display devices to an increasing number ofbuyers.andM;OBSERVING PROTOCOLandM;The X Window System was developed at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology as a graphical window interface that allows users to createwindows on their terminals.andP;  X terminals typically connect directly toEthernet, permitting users to access applications from diffrent hosts on thenetwork simultaneously.andM;Unlike other graphics protocols, the X windows graphical interface isdevice-independent, which means that it can run across a wide variety ofhardware platforms.andP;  Device independence is clearly an advantage for the XWindow System, as buyers and vendors are moving closer to open systemsenvironments.andM;Because high-resolution X terminals can connect directly to an Ethernetnetwork, they can take advantage of Ethernet's 10Mbit-per-second (Mbps) datatransfer rate, which is substantially higher than the maximum transfer rateof 38.4Kbits per second afforded by RS-232-C interfaces.andM;As a result, the performance of high-resolution X terminals can approach thatof low-end workstations, but at significantly lower prices per unit.andP;  Pricesfor high-resolution workstations configured with some local memory and Xwindows support generally start at around $10,000 or $15,000.andP;  By contrast,high-resolution X terminals start as low as $2,550 for Network ComputingDevices' NCD 16 and peak at $37,500 for Tektronix's 4237 3D GraphicsNetstation, which includes 3-D image support.andM;All high-resolution graphics terminals can include large local memorycapacities and graphics co-processors.andP;  Such terminals can perform computingtasks independently from the host system in much the same way asworkstations.andM;For instance, most high-end graphics terminals have enough information storedin their firmware to perform functions such as drawing geometric shapes andzooming in on sections of displayed images.andP;  Low-end graphics and ASCIIterminals, by contrast, require a host command and data to execute specificinstructions.andM;Increased freedom from host reliance allows X terminals to speed imageprocessing.andP;  They are less dependent on the input/output transmission ratesof the terminal-to-host links, and therefore they reduce host processingloads and network traffic.andP;  With their boosted functionality and performance,X terminals can run applications previously associated with workstations,such as CAD/CAM and desktop publishing packages.andM;There are some cases in which only a workstation will do, of course.andP;  Forinstance, network users who need to run computation-intensive applications,such as real-time graphics packages, or applications that require retrievingsubstantial amounts of data from a host, such as flight simulation,high-performance CAD/CAM applications and finite element modeling, wouldprobably benefit more from workstations than high-resolution X terminals.andM;Buyers should note that there are several X windows implementations.andP;  Mostinvolve running X windows locally and the terminal operating as a server.andP;  Insuch cases, the terminals require large amounts of memory, which drives uptheir prices.andM;However, some X terminals don't actually run X windows.andP;  Instead, an RS-232-Cconnection is made to the host, which runs X windows and an X windowsconversion package.andP;  Although the extra software could burden the hostsystem, the advantage to this implementation is that the terminals requireless memory than terminals that run the X windows system locally.andM;MATTERS OF PROTOCOLandM;Many vendors and market analysts are speculating that the X Window Systemwill soon surpass other graphics protocols as the most likely candidate to bethe industry's standard graphics protocol.andP;  &quot;A lot of the other graphicsprotocols will dry up,&quot; said Mike Braca, vice president of softwareengineering at Visual Technology.andM;Still, much depends on DEC's next move.andP;  Once DEC endorses X windows byintroducing an X terminal of its own, the status of the protocol shouldbecome even more solid.andP;  DEC has demonstrated an X terminal but hasn'tannounced the product's release date yet.andP;  Judging by DEC's other graphicsterminal offerings, which are well below the 1,000-pixel vertical-resolutionmark, the device will probably be of the low- or medium-resolution variety.andM;Even if hardware vendors accept the X windows interface with open arms,graphics terminals will still need to support other graphics protocols, atleast for now, because many software vendors haven't yet ported theirgraphics applications to X windows.andM;At present, there are several other graphics protocols that function at theapplication interface level.andP;  DEC's ReGIS has long been considered a de factostandard, but its popularity is waning, in part because it'sdevice-dependent.andP;  Tektronix 4010 and 4014 emulations are still enjoying wideuse and de facto standard status.andP;  But like ReGIS, the device-dependence ofthe Tektronix emulations may prevent them from being blessed as officialstandards.andM;Recently, a new generation of graphics protocols has entered the fray.andP;  GKSand Phigs have been established as viable alternatives.andP;  Both protocols giveusers device independence at the application interface level.andM;Although GKS protocol support is fairly common among graphics terminals,Phigs is quickly assuming a more dominant role.andP;  Phigs provides an effectiveprotocol for most two-dimensional graphics applications and is quicklybecoming a de facto standard for three-dimensional graphics applications aswell.andP;  Once PEX, the Phigs extension to X, becomes available, Phigs will havethe added benefit of being able to function within X windows.andP;  PEX is beingdeveloped by a subcommittee of the X Consortium, which includes MIT andleading terminal and workstation vendors such as DEC and Sun Microsystems.andO;The extension is expected to be completed by year's end.andM;The transition to the X Window System won't happen overnight.andP;  Otherapplication interface-level protocols will continue to be used at many DECsites.andP;  For now, therefore, perhaps buyers would be wise to shop for graphicsterminals that support a variety of protocols.andM;For X windows as well as other high-resolution graphics terminals, there area number of important distinguishing characteristics.andP;  Most high-resolutiongraphics terminals offer resolutions in the neighborhood of 1,280 by 1,024pixels, but there are three significant exceptions.andP;  Codonics' 4096-19 topsthe field with 16,000-by-12,000-pixel resolution, and Evans andamp; Sutherland's PS390 and Megascan's MS-332 offer 8,192-by-6,912 and 4,096-by-3,300resolutions, respectively.andM;It's worth noting that color monitors previously tended to have lower screenresolutions than their monochrome counterparts.andP;  Now, however, colorterminals usually offer resolutions that are comparable to monochromeofferings.andP;  The Codonics and Megascan high-resolution terminals aremonochrome, for instance, but the Evans andamp; Sutherland PS 390 is a color model.andM;Refresh rates, or vertical scan frequencies, tend to be higher for high-endgraphics terminals than for low- and medium-resolution models, which havevertical resolutions below 1,000 pixels.andP;  Higher refresh rates reduce eyefatigue by providing brighter screens and flicker-free displays.andM;Monochrome terminals offer consistently higher refresh rates, averagingaround 70Hz, whereas most color terminals have 60Hz ratings.andP;  The 60Hzrefresh rate is adequate for most applications, but users who spend extendedperiods staring at their terminal screens would benefit from the higherrates.andM;Although color terminals are beginning to approach the image quality ofmonochrome models, they still tend to cost considerably more than comparablemonochrome offerings.andP;  Unless they have money to burn, buyers shoulddetermine whether they really need color for their particular applications.andO;In some cases, such as electronic CAD, color is essential.andP;  But for manydesktop publishing and office automation applications, a monochrome monitorthat offers various shades of gray may suffice.andM;Image quality is also enhanced by the non-interlaced displays mosthigh-resolution graphics terminals use.andP;  Although they generate more screenflicker, interlaced displays were once common because they were lessexpensive.andP;  Now, however, most high-resolution graphics terminals havenon-interlaced displays, which update every pixel on the screen during eachrefresh operation.andM;In addition, most terminals let users zoom in on a specific part of agraphics image.andP;  There are two zooming methods.andP;  True zoom focuses on andthen recasts a subsection of a graphics image in full detail, but in muchlarger terms.andP;  Zooming by pixel replication produces the area of focus withlower resolution and less detail.andP;  Most terminals support one or the other ofthose methods, and a few terminals support both.andM;Tektronix offers high-resolution graphics terminals that supportthree-dimensional displays.andP;  The capability is desirable for applicationssuch as high-level CAD and flight simulation, but it adds considerable costto a terminal.andP;  Tektronix's 3D Graphics Netstations are among the mostexpensive of the DEC-compatible high-resolution graphics terminals, rangingfrom $23,500 to $37,500.andM;Graphics terminals must support Phigs in order to draw three-dimensionalimages (GKS allows for very limited 3-D drawing).andP;  When PEX software becomesavailable, vendors will be able to design X terminals that use the Phigsgraphics protocol to produce three-dimensional images.andM;Buyers who are uncertain whether to opt for high-resolution graphicsterminals, personal computers or workstations should consider one otherfactor: system administration.andP;  Workstations and personal computers need tobe managed locally, whereas graphics terminals can be maintained from a hostnode by network managers.andP;  If users lack the expertise to manage their ownsystems, stand-alone devices can be more problematic and expensive tomaintain than host-dependent terminals, especially if MIS staffing is low.andM;OTHER SIDE OF THE COINandM;Of course, the other side of the issue is system performance.andP;  Buyers mustmake sure that host systems can handle the I/O loads that numeroushost-dependent graphics terminals, each potentially running a variety ofapplications and generating a lot of network traffic, can impose.andM;Aid for terminal and host I/O bottlenecks may be in sight, however.andP;  Marketanalysts expect FDDI networks to become more prevalent in the next severalyears.andP;  They believe vendors will increasingly offer graphics terminals thattake advantage of the 100Mbps communications rate offered by fiber-opticnetworks.andM;Such a high communication speed will further blur the distinctions betweenterminals and workstations, letting even real-time graphics applications runon terminals.andP;  The MS-332 from Megascan, for instance, includes a fiber-opticinterface.andP;  Priced at $12,900, the MS-332 supports a maximum communicationspeed of 65Mbps.andM;Fiber-optic cabling is significantly more expensive to purchase and installthan RS-232-C and Ethernet.andP;  Buyers who need to boost the speed of terminaland host communications but can't justify the expense of fiber-optics canchoose Ethernet networks, which are slower--10Mbps--but considerably cheaper.andM;According to Eric Wogsberg, chief executive officer of Jupiter Systems, thecosts associated with FDDI will decrease as fiber-optic technology matures.andO;At that time, he said, more vendors will introduce high-resolution graphicsterminals that support fiber-optic interfaces.andM;What all this means is that the high-resolution graphics terminal picture ismuch clearer and better--literally and figuratively--than it was just a yearago.andP;  With vendors adding X windows support, substantial local memory anddirect Ethernet connections, and with widespread FDDI implementation in thewings, these graphics terminals have moved from being nearly obsolete togenerating excitement among graphics display shoppers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
