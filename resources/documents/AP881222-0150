Dr. Marsha Cline Holleman of the Family Practice Center at BaylorCollege of Medicine in Houston, and her husband, Warren L. Holleman,an assistant professor of ethics there, suggested doctors notprovide excuses unless they actually treat the patients.   Physicians also should develop guidelines for handling requestsfor school and work releases, they said.   Until guidelines are developed, doctors ``will continue to beplaced in a compromising position _ medically, ethically, legally,and financially _ while doing little to ameliorate the problems ofcasual absenteeism,'' the Hollemans wrote in Friday's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association.   While the report had no figures on the number of ``casualabsentee'' cases per year, the Hollemans said earlier researchindicated casual absenteeism has been on the rise for 25 years andmay cost U.S. industry $30 billion a year.   Workers who appear well often tell doctors they are sick, theresearchers said. In addition, they said, some employers pressuredoctors to reveal confidential information about a patient'sillnesses to get a patient back to work.   ``The worker has few incentives to tell the truth and thephysician has few incentives to ascertain the truth,'' the Hollemanswrote. ``The physician who questions the veracity of this worker'sclaim can look forward to losing the worker's family as patients _or, if they remain, to a strained relationship. The physician whorefuses to sign this worker's release might feel awkward aboutcharging a fee for the visit.''   They said absenteeism often is triggered by workplace atmosphere,finances, or other non-medical problems that should be dealt with bysomeone other than a doctor.   ``Asking physicians to police the problem is treating the symptomrather than the disease,'' they wrote.   At least one ethics professor was troubled about the idea ofstrict guidelines.   Kenneth Vaux, a professor of ethics at the University of IllinoisCollege of Medicine in Chicago, said doctors should retain theirtraditional roles as ``protectors of the weak.''   Guidelines allowing absence excuses only with treatment could beaimed at generating more medical business, and workers may not bewell protected if companies hire doctors to screen patient care, hesaid.   ``We can't go to the point where a physician becomes aninstrument of societal vigilance and societal vengeance,'' Vaux said.</TEXT></DOC>
