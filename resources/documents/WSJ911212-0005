Snakes like to come in through the toilets.</LP><TEXT>   At night, they hang from trees like fat, brown strands ofcooked spaghetti. They attack U.S. military bases. Theyslither up power poles. They wipe out entire birdpopulations, attack children and crawl into homes looking forfood. Some are 10 feet long. And they're so tough theyactually can bump up against an electrified fence and keepcoming back for more.   This is really gross.   There are as many as three million snakes here on a landmass of 212 square miles. That's an average of 14,000 snakesper square mile, or 22 snakes for every man, woman and child.Now, the U.S. government, armed with $1.5 million fromCongress, is mounting a counterattack. Wildlife biologistThomas Fritts and a team of researchers have been zapping thesnakes silly in experimental electric corrals, luring theminto traps, testing fumigants and trying to figure out if, inthe case of snakes, sex can kill. If all else fails, theyfigure maybe at least they can establish some &quot;snake-freezones.&quot;   What makes this research work so difficult is the natureof the foe. &quot;Boiga irregularis&quot; -- known as a brown treesnake -- lives in trees but is equally adept on the ground,so it's difficult to keep the snake in or out of any largearea. The snakes are hard to starve out because they willdine on any small critter.   Indigenous to the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and northernAustralia, the snakes first turned up in Guam shortly afterWorld War II, apparently as stowaways on a cargo ship. Theyproliferate maddeningly fast because they have no naturalpredators on Guam. For decades, the snakes were mostlyunnoticed, content to devour lizards and birds. But by theearly 1980s local biologists discovered the snakes had wipedout nine of 12 native birds species, critically depleted therest and had run so low on lizards that they began foragingin homes for more varied food.   &quot;Two snakes came through the commode of my home the otherday,&quot; says Marilyn D.A. Manibusan, a territorial senator. &quot;Ithrew boiling water at them.&quot; A lot of people put screensover their sewer vents to keep the snakes from entering viathe toilet.   By day, the nocturnal snakes seem to disappear. Indeed,many people in Guam say they've never seen one. But thesnakes, which are mildly poisonous, have been found coiledaround screaming infants, their mouths locked on tiny handsin vain attempts to swallow the babies. Though no knowndeaths have resulted, 53 emergency room cases of snakebiteswere reported in the Guam Memorial Hospital between 1986 and1989, including four in which doctors said infant victimscame perilously close to death.   The problem finally drew widespread public attention afterthe snakes began crawling over power lines and electrocutingthemselves, knocking out power in the process. Between 1978and 1990, Guam was hit by an estimated 680 snake-relatedoutages, in some cases blacking out the entire island.Exasperated, the Guam Power Authority wound up turning offfrom dusk to dawn a utility pole that had suffered 17 faults,effectively ceding it to the snakes.   The U.S. military soon found out itself that the reptileis a resourceful opponent. At one base, commanders orderedthe bottoms of power poles wrapped with sleeves of slickmetal in hopes of keeping the snakes off. They were chagrinedto later discover the snakes don't even go up the poles; theyprefer the supporting guy wires. So the next tack was toerect screen-wire barriers around the guy wires. The snakessimply climbed over.   So, what to do?   Gordon Rodda, of the Arizona Cooperative Fish and WildlifeResearch Unit in Tucson, tried to build a better snake trap.He tried using lizards, chicken litter and quail as bait, butfound that white mice work best. &quot;If you put out 100 trapswith quail bait, you find six snakes in them, but with whitemice you find 25 snakes out of 100 traps,&quot; he says.   The downside: &quot;We don't really want to import a millionwhite mice to Guam,&quot; says Mr. Fritts. So Mr. Fritts says theresearchers hope to come up with an artificial white mousethat can be used in its place.   In fact, just about every solution seems to have a catch.Officials considered importing mongooses or paying a bountyon dead snakes. But mongooses hunt by day and sleep by night-- opposite of the snakes -- and Guam officials concludedthat a bounty would only encourage enterprising entrepreneursto start raising snakes commercially.   Earl Campbell, a researcher with the Ohio Cooperative Fishand Wildlife Research Unit, has designed electrified snakefences that carry 8,000 volts. He says he has sat up nightafter night watching surrounded snakes zap themselves -- andthen zap themselves again. In the long run, though, &quot;themortality rate is 70%,&quot; he says. But the fences are expensiveand can only be used in small areas, perhaps such as theairport and port. They could also be used to create a fewsnake-free Edens.   Great hopes are also being placed on work being done byPeter Savarie, a Denver-based research pharmacologist withthe U.S. Department of Agriculture. He says methyl bromide,in appropriate doses, kills the snakes. But that also couldonly be used in small areas, and requires trained personnel.   A snake-killing virus is one idea, but no one knows yetwhich virus would do the trick. Another possibility is usingsex pheromones to attract snakes into a designated &quot;poisonstation,&quot; where they could be killed off. Great idea, exceptno one knows for sure that the snakes are actually attractedby such sex lures.   As biologist Fritts says: &quot;Each line of research may havesome place, but no one of them is going to solve theproblem.&quot;   Meanwhile, Guam's Division of Aquatic and WildlifeResources is pushing its own modest proposal: recipes forbrown tree snake, such as snake meat in coconut milk,deep-fried snake and sweet-and-sour snake. &quot;I haven't eatenit personally,&quot; says wildlife biologist Michael McCoid, &quot;butpeople who have say it's tasty, like&quot; -- you guessed it --&quot;chicken.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
