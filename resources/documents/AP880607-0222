The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Monday closed AmericanDiversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and LoanAssociation, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover ofthe thrifts by another institution.   ``These two represented abuses,'' said bank board member LawrenceWhite. ``The whole essence of being a depository institution withgovernment-provided insurance is that there is a strong ...obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner. These two placesdid not.''   Both institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulatorstook over management of American Diversified in 1986 and of NorthAmerica in 1987.   The bank board is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositors in thelargest cash payout the agency has made, agency Chairman M. DannyWall said. It is covering $209 million in deposits at North America.   Wall said on NBC's ``Today'' program, both state and federalregulators are looking more closely today at troubled institutionsthan they were several years ago.   A total of about $500,000 in both institutions exceeded theFSLIC's $100,000 liability limit. Those depositors will share inliquidation proceeds. The bank board expects to recover about $400million from the sale of the thrifts' assets.   Nationally, only 10 of 235 failed savings and loans since 1981have been resolved with a straight payout to depositors. Usually,the bank board pays a bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick Sandamp;Lbecause it is cheaper. At the very least, the board arranges totransfer deposits to another institution.   But the unique characteristics of the two California thrifts madethat impractical, Wall said.   The thrifts had few retail deposits, lacked branch offices, andrelied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged through brokers.The brokers in turn lent out the deposits for speculative realestate ventures and other risky investments, Wall said.   Closing the two thrifts will help all Sandamp;Ls by reducing pressureto pay high interest rates, he said. Failing thrifts pay high ratesto get the cash needed to meet expenses and some healthy thriftshave had to raise their rates to compete.   North America was paying 8.53 percent interest on deposits, 1.45percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions.American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent.   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,said the two thrifts were prime examples of ``several score''high-flying institutions that in the early and mid-1980s usedfederally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky lending.Regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check it, hesaid.   ``It was a systemic breakdown,'' Ely said. ``What we are seeingare two of the more extreme examples of it. But they're not the onlyones out there. There are others.''   Fred Wolf, director of accounting and general management for theGeneral Accounting Office, said today on ABC-TV's ``Good MorningAmerica,'' 500 savings and loan institutions are insolvent and 200of them ``are what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent.''   Duayne Christensen, an Orange County dentist, formed NorthAmerica in 1983. Taking advantage of the deregulated interest ratesand liberalized lending and investment rules, it solicited depositsat high interest rates and invested the funds primarily in high-riskreal estate deals that later failed.   Christensen was killed in an automobile accident last year theday before regulators seized North America. In a lawsuit filedagainst his estate and a former associate, the FSLIC accusedChristensen of fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciaryresponsibility, and sought at least $40 million in damages.   Ranhir Sahni, a former airline pilot, acquired AmericanDiversified in 1983. He also pursued an aggressive growth strategy,increasing the thrift's asset size to almost $800 million, from $11million, in less than two years.   Sahni invested in ``wind farms'' designed to produce electricity,and in other non-traditional areas including two ethanol plants.   Federal regulators have filed suit, accusing Sahni and otherofficers and directors of fraud and racketeering and are seeking atleast $60 million in damages.   American Diversifed and North America were two of six OrangeCounty savings and loans operating under the FSLIC's ``managementconsignment'' program as of October.   Since 1984, 31 California thrifts have come under receivership orconservatorship by state or federal regulators, according to theCalifornia Department of Savings and Loan.   ``The laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble,''said state Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford. ``Idon't know how you insure against it.''   Prior to American Diversified, the largest cash payout was $300million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
