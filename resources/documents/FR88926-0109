Relating to Prompt Payment for Investment CompanyShares </ITAG>Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on November 21, 1986 theNational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rulechange and filed and amendment thereto on September 8, 1988, as describedin Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposedrule change from interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The proposed rule change adds a new paragraph (m) to Article III, Section26 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice that establishes time frames withinwhich members must transmit payments for Investment Company shares to investmentcompanies or their agents. <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerningthe purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed anycomments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statementsmay be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD hasprepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of themost significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change Since 1955 prompt payment by NASD members for mutual fund shares whichthey have sold to customers has been governed by the NASD Board of Governors'Prompt Payment Interpretation. That Interpretation does not include a definitionof the term ``prompt payment''. It is proposed that the interpretationbe rescinded and the proposed amendment to Article III, Section 26 substituted.This section will define the term of ``prompt payment'' in two differentsets of circumstances. Paragraph 1 of the proposed rule change will requiremembers, including underwriters, who engage in direct retail transactionswith customers to transmit payments which are received from customers tomutual funds or their agents by the later of the trade date plus five (5)business days or the end of one (1) business day following receipt of thecustomers payment for such shares. The amendment to the proposed rule changewas adopted in response to advice by the staff of the Commission's Divisionof Market Regulation that the provision in the rule regarding transmittalof funds irrespective of receipt of payment was a requirement that couldcause broker-dealers to violate the provisions of Section 11(d)(1) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.\1\<NOTE/> The amendment to the proposed rule change would remove therequirement that payments be transmitted in instances in which customerpayments have not been received by the member, thereby alleviating concernthat the rule would result in impermissible extensions of credit in violationof Section 11(d)(1) of the Act.\2\<NOTE/> The proposed rule change also will require members that areunderwriters and that engage in wholesale transactions with other membersto transmit payments received from such members to the funds of their agentsby the end of two (2) business days following the receipt of such funds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 11(d)(1) prohibits a person that acts as botha broker and a dealer from effecting transactions in which the broker-dealerextends, maintains or arranges credit for the customer on a security thatis part of a new issue in which it participated as a member of the sellinggroup or syndicate within 30 days prior to the transaction. Since investmentcompany shares are continuously in registration and members normally offerthese shares pursuant to a sales agreement with a principal underwriter,it is the Commission's position that members that are broker-dealers andthat offer investment company shares are subject to the provisions of Section11(d) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In response to the Division's concerns with the originalproposal of November 21, 1986 regarding extensions of credit, the NASDrequested that the Commission not publish the proposed rule change untilthe Association filed an amendment. These changes are consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Securities ExchangeAct, which requires that NASD rules be designed to facilitate transactionsin securities and remove market impediments, and with section 17A(a)(1)in that they will aid in ensuring the prompt clearance and settlement ofinvestment company transactions. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Association believes that the proposed rule change does not imposeany burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance ofthe purposes of the Act.C.
