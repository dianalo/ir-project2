The biggest headache at most rural banks for the past year has been sluggish demand for loans. Despite rising crop prices and strong government price supports, a six-year wave of farm bankruptcies had curbed most farmers' appetite for new debt.    But now, farm-loan demand is finally picking up. Many farmers' equipment is so worn that they are forced to replace it, often on credit. A bottoming-out of Midwest real-estate prices is spurring many farmers and others to buy land for the first time in a decade.    According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks with problem loans exceeding capital -- a leading indicator of potential failure -- fell to 126 on Dec. 31, 1987, from 146 on Sept. 30, 1987. A farm bank is one that has 25% or more of its loans to farmers. The number of farm banks facing potential failure peaked at 230 on June 30, 1986.    Many lenders expect this year to see their first rise in farm loans since the early 1980s, when they began to prune delinquent debt from their books.    But competition for farm-loan business is fierce. Norwest Corp., a Minneapolis-based bank holding company, plans to expand its agriculture-related loans by 10% this year by resurrecting some techniques from the go-go 1970s. Its farm loan officers are beginning to telephone competitors' customers. And its local banks are running newspaper and radio ads aimed at farmers.    Interest-rate skirmishes are breaking out. The Omaha bank of the Farm Credit System lowered its interest rates as part of a drive to regain market share it lost during the farm crisis. That has brought protests from Iowa bankers, who claim that the Omaha bank is engaging in the type of predatory pricing prohibited under the terms of the Farm Credit System's recent bailout by the Reagan administration.    &quot;They've taken away customers,&quot; complains Wes Ehrecke, senior vice president of the Iowa Bankers Association, a trade group.    James Kirk, president and chief executive of the Omaha bank, denies undercutting competitors. But as a result of lower rates, he said the bank expects the number of its good loans to increase this year for the first time since 1983.    New lenders are emerging. Des Moines, Iowa-based Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. is experimenting with selling seed on credit to farmers. Until now, the company had only accepted cash, a spokesman said.    The survivors of the farm crisis are becoming attractive to lenders because many no longer have any debt, and the value of the land they can use as collateral is rising again. Through April 1, Iowa land values had risen 19% from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.    The National Bank of Waterloo, Iowa, is snapping up small banks as part of a campaign to build its farm lending business. &quot;Farmers have a lot of cash,&quot; said Willis Crees, senior vice president. &quot;We have weeded out the weak ones.&quot;    All this is raising some concern that creditors are pushing too hard for farmers to expand. But state regulators believe a rebound in lending income will ease the pressure on banks to find alternative ways to make money. Two Minnesota banks were closed last year after they were sunk by speculative investments in securities. </TEXT></DOC>
