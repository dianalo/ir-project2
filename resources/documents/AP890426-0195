The ruling, which was watched closely by cable TV operators whofear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf, affirmed apreliminary decision last year to let General Telephone build andoperate the coaxial (bundled copper wire) cable system in the LosAngeles suburb of Cerritos. GTE of California also provides phoneservice to Cerritos.   The FCC said there had been no adequate bids submitted to thecity of Cerritos for cable service except from General Telephone.GTE is leasing the system to Apollo CableVision to provideprogramming.   A GTE affiliate, GTE Services Corp., will install a fiber-opticcable network to experiment with services such as near-video ondemand, which will allow customers to phone in orders for moviesthat will be running on 30 channels. Some movies will begin every15 minutes.   Wednesday's decision was challenged immediately by the NationalCable Television Association, which said it appears to violatefederal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cableTV business.   Current rules bar phone companies from generating cableprogramming in the same areas where they provide telephone service.Federal rules also bar the seven regional Bell operating companiesfrom owning cable services anywhere in the country, but allowcompanies like GTE to do so outside their service areas.   The FCC in July 1988 preliminarily voted to considerrecommending to Congress that telephone companies be allowed intocable TV in the regions they serve. The FCC also suggested it wouldtry to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV, even ifCongress fails to act, by broadly defining ``good cause'' forwaivers.   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephonecompanies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use thosewires to sell video programs too.   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said Wednesday's ruling did notpresage any final FCC judgment on the cable-telephone company issue.   ``This grant of this very limited waiver may produce veryvaluable information that will be useful to the commssion and theCongress in evaluating that more generic question,'' he said. ``Theprecedent that results is narrow.''</TEXT></DOC>
