Introduction</ITAG>EPA is currently collecting information to be used as a basis for potentialredefinition of the coastal subcategory and development of effluent limitationsguidelines and standards covering the produced water, drilling fluids,drill cuttings, and miscellaneous waste streams in the coastal subcategoryof the oil and gas extraction point source category. These regulationswould apply to discharges from facilities involved in exploration, development,and production operations. Such activities are included in Standard IndustrialClassification (SIC) Major Group 13. Any regulation issued could affectnot only the coastal subcategory but also the onshore subcategory, becausesome facilities that are currently classified as coastal could be reclassifiedas onshore. The Agency is also considering whether regulations coveringstripper oil wells and marginal gas wells should be included in the coastalsubcategory regulations and is considering a definition of marginal gaswells for purposes of regulating these facilities.The current definition of coastal encompasses facilities in any water bodylandward of the inner boundary of the territorial seas regardless of anywater characteristics such as salinity. This means, for example, that afacility located in the Great Lakes is currently classified as a coastalfacility. The Agency is examining a possible redefinition of the coastalsubcategory that is based on the salinity of the water in which the facilityis located.This notice presents key issues involved in the development of effluentlimitations guidelines and discusses the steps that would need to be takento develop sufficient information to propose new regulations. After discussingthe legal authority for rulemaking in the coastal subcategory (SectionII) and summarizing current and previous coastal subcategory regulations(Section III), today's notice presents options for definition of the coastalsubcategory (Section IV). The Agency's preliminary profile of coastal facilitiesis outlined in Section V, and its plans for developing the final profileare also presented. Stripper oil wells and marginal gas wells are discussedin Section VI. Preliminary information about the environmental characteristicsof the coastal geographical water areas are presented in Section VII. Adiscussion of pollution control technologies which may be applicable tothe coastal and stripper subcategories is included in Section VIII. Majornon-water quality environmental impacts which will be addressed by theAgency are discussed in Section IX.Further information and data will be needed by the Agency to determinethe technological feasibility and economic achievability of the variouspollution control technologies to be considered if the Agency proceedswith rulemaking in the costal subcategory. Data collection efforts wouldinclude the use of a survey of coastal facilities under Section 308 ofthe Clean Water Act; details are presented in Section X. A glossary ofpertinent terms is included at the end of this notice in Appendix A.On August 25, 1988 EPA published a notice announcing its proposed plansfor promulgating new effluent guidelines to implement section 304(m) ofthe Clean Water Act (53 FR 32584). The coastal subcategory was identifiedin that notice as a potential candidate for new guidelines. EPA is currentlypreparing its final plans for implementing section 304(m) and expects topublish them in a final notice this fall. That notice will announce whetheror not EPA has identified the coastal subcategory as one for which newguidelines will be prepared.The Agency is requesting comment on the information, analyses, and potentialapproaches to controlling discharges from coastal, stripper oil, and marginalgas well facilities that are discussed in today's notice. The commentsreceived will be considered in the development of coastal regulations shouldthe Agency decide to undertake rulemaking in the coastal subcategory.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Legal Background</ITAG>The regulations described in this notice are being developed under theauthority of sections 301, 304 (b), (c), and (e), 306, 307, and 501 ofthe Clean Water Act (The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendmentsof 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water QualityAct of 1987 and the Water Quality Act of 1987) (the Act), 33 U.S.C. 1311,1314 (b), (c), and (e), 1315, 1317, and 1361; 86 Stat. 816, Pub. L. 92-500;91 Stat. 1567, Pub. L. 95-215; 101 Stat. 7, Pub. L. 100-4 (``the Act'').The Clean Water Act establishes a comprehensive program to ``restore andmaintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation'swaters.'' [Section 101(a)]. To implement the Act, EPA is to issue technologybased effluent limitations guidelines, new source performance standardsand pretreatment standards for industrial dischargers. The levels of controlassociated with these effluent limitations guidelines and standards aresummarized briefly below.A. Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT)BPT limitations are generally based on the average of the best existingperformance by plants of various sizes, ages, and unit processes withinthe category of subcategory.In establishing BPT limitations, EPA considers the total cost in relationto the age of equipment and facilities involved, the processes employed,process changes required, engineering aspects of the control technologiesand nonwater quality environmental impacts (including energy requirements).The total cost of applying the technology is considered in relation tothe effluent reduction benefits.B. Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT)BAT limitations, in general, represent the best existing performance inthe industrial subcategory or category. The Act establishes BAT as a principalnational means of controlling the direct discharge of toxic and nonconventionalpollutants to navigable waters. In arriving at BAT, the Agency considersthe age of the equipment and facilities involved, the process employed,the engineering aspects of the control technologies, process changes, thecosts and economic impact of achieving such effluent reduction, and nonwaterquality environmental impacts. The Agency retains considerable discretionin assigning the weight to be accorded these factors.C. Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT)The 1977 Amendments added section 301(b)(2)(E) to the Act establishing``best conventional pollutant control technology'' (BCT) for dischargesof conventional pollutants from existing industrial point sources. Section304(a)(4) designated the following as conventional pollutants: Biochemicaloxygen demanding pollutants (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), fecalcoliform, pH, and any additional pollutants defined by the Administratoras conventional. The Administrator designated oil and grease as an additionalconventional pollutant on July 30, 1979 (44 FR 44501).BCT is not an additional limitation but replaces BAT for the control ofconventional pollutants. In addition to other factors specified in section304(b)(4)(B), the Act requires that BCT limitations be established in lightof a two part ``cost-reasonableness'' test. <T3>Ameican Paper Institute </T3>v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 660 F.2d 954 (4th Cir. 1981). EPA first published its methodologyfor carrying out the BCT analysis on August 19, 1979 (44 FR 50372).A revised methodology for the general development of BCT limitations wasproposed on October 29, 1982 (47 FR 49176), and became effective on August22, 1986 (51 FR 24974; July 9, 1986).D. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)NSPS are based on the best available demonstrated technology (BDT). Newplants have the opportunity to install the best and most efficient productionprocesses and wastewater treatment technologies.E. Pretreatment StandardsThe Act also directs EPA to promulgate Pretreatment Standards for Existingand New Sources (PSES and PSNS) to prevent the discharge of pollutantsthat pass through, interfere with, or are otherwise incompatible with theoperation of a publicly-owned treatment works (POTW).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Current and Previous Coastal Subcategory Regulations </ITAG>The coastal subcategory is one of five subcategories of the oil and gasextraction industry that are established in EPA's regulations at 40 CFRpart 435. (The other subcategories are Offshore, Onshore, Agriculturaland Wildlife Water Use (formerly Beneficial Use) and Stripper.) The currentcoastal subcategory regulations were promulgated on April 13, 1979 (44FR 22069). They include effluent limitations guidelines at the BPT levelof control only. The existing BPT guidelines limit the discharge of oil and grease in producedwater to 72 mg/L as a daily maximum and 48 mg/L as a 30-day average. Thedischarge of free oil in deck drainage, drilling fluids, drill cuttings,and well treatment fluids is prohibited. Minimum daily residual chlorinecontent in sanitary discharges from those facilities continuously mannedby ten or more persons is limited to 1 mg/L. The discharge of floatingsolids in sanitary and domestic wastes is prohibited. 40 CFR 435.42(a).The current coastal subcategory regulations in 40 CFR 435.40 apply to:<ITAG tagnum="21">*** facilities engaged in production, field exploration, drilling,well completion and well treatment in areas defined as coastal.</ITAG>The term ``coastal'' is defined at 40 CFR 435.41(e) as:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) any body of water landward of the territorial seas as definedat 40 CFR 125.1(gg) or (2) any wetlands adjacent to such waters.</ITAG>The term ``wetlands'' is defined at 40 CFR 435.41(f) as:<ITAG tagnum="21">*** those surface areas which are inundated or saturated by surfaceor groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and thatunder normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typicallyadapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally includeswamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.</ITAG>Thus, the coast subcategory regulations currently apply to oil and gasdevelopment and production facilities throughout the United States thatare landward of the inner boundary of the territorial seas and that arelocated in water or adjacent wetlands. The regulations do not differentiatebetween freshwater and saline water for purposes of defining the geographicscope of the coastal subcategory. The Agency promulgated the current definition of the coastal subcategoryafter reconsidering and rejecting a previous definition that was includedin interim final BPT regulations for the coastal subcategory. (41 FR 44942-48;October 13, 1976). The 1976 interim final rules defined coastal to meanall land and water areas landward from the inner boundary of the territorialseas and eastward of the point defined by 89 degrees 45 minutes W. Longitudeand 29 degrees 46 minutes N. Latitude and continuing west of that pointthrough a series of longitude and latitude coordinates (the Chapman line)to the point 97 degres 19 minutes W. Longitude and continuing southwardfrom that point to the U.S.-Mexican border. This included Louisiana andTexas Gulf coast areas as well as other areas along the Gulf coast. The1976 definition was intended to include all facilities of which the Agencywas aware that were both landward of the inner boundary of the territorialseas and that were located in the waters of states that permitted the dischargeof produced water. The Agency rejected this approach when it adopted the current definitionin 1979 for four reasons. First, industry identified a significant numberof facilities near coastlines that nevertheless were not included withinthe regulatory scope of the subcategory. Second, certain platforms in UpperCook inlet, Alaska were not included in the subcategory. Third, the 1976definition of the coastal subcategory required the Agency to reassess theexisting boundaries of the coastal subcategory whenever industry explorednew areas that might have been considered coastal. Finally, the 1976 definitionclassified in the coastal subcategory an estimated 1700 wells which wereoperated on land but which discharged into coastal waters. Under the final BPT regulations issued on April 13, 1979, approximately1200 of these wells were reclassified into the onshore subcategory andthe remainder were reclassified as stripper wells, depending on their rateof production. The wells that were reclassified as onshore were requiredto attain zero discharge. Industry challenged the 1979 final rule in theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing among otherthings that the Agency had failed to adequately consider the costs to thereclassifeid facilities of attaining zero discharge. As a result of thecourt's decision [<T3>American Petroleum Institute</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 661 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. 1981)], EPA suspended the applicabilityof the onshore subcategory regulations to the reclassified facilities andto any wells in the 1976 geographic coastal area that came into existenceafter the issuance of the 1979 final rules. (47 FR 31455; July 21, 1982).Such facilities continue to be regulated under the coastal subcategoryregulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Modifications to the Coastal Definition </ITAG>A. Introduction Should EPA decide to proceed with this rulemaking, the Agency is consideringproposing a new definition of the coastal subcategory that is based upona water classification system developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,United States Department of Interior, in the ``Classification of Wetlandsand Deepwater Habitats of the United States,'' December 1979, FWS/OBS-79/31.As a part of this water classification system, wetlands and deepwater habitatshave been identified. In general terms, wetlands are lands where saturationwith water (or at least periodic saturation) is the dominant factor indetermining the types of plant and animal communities living in the soilor on its surface. Deepwater habitats, however, are permanently floodedlands, that are often deep, so that water rather than air is the principalmedium within which the dominant organisms live. Wetlands and deepwaterhabitats have been and are being identified and mapped according to thefollowing procedure. Through the use of the National Altitude Photography program, aerial photographsare taken either in spring (April-May) or in the fall at the time whenthe trees have no leaves (October-November). These aerial photos are interpretedby identifying the flora and fauna which appear in them. From this, thewater classification of the area in the photo can be determined. In additionto the photos, ancillary information is used to further define an area.Sources of such ancillary information include: U.S. Geologic Survey streammonitoring reports which verify salinity values, US Soil Conservation Servicecounty soil surveys, and actual field work data. The aerial photographsundergo two quality assurance reviews before they are superimposed on theUSGS topographic maps. The results are 1:24000 scale ``draft'' wetlandmaps. These draft maps are distributed for review and comment to Federal,State, local and private organizations and to anyone who may have an opportunityto field check the wetland delineations. These users are able to make fieldobservations and provide comments before the final wetlands maps are produced.These maps clearly show the different water types as they have been classifiedand are readily available for use. In classifying the wetlands and deepwater habitats, the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService has used terms <T3>marine system</T3> and <T3>estuarine system.</T3> The following are general descriptions of theseterms. (The exact definitions of these terms and others are presented inthe glossary located at the end of this notice in appendix A.) <ITAG tagnum="81">Marine System </ITAG>This term is generally applied to the open ocean and its assocaited coastline.It is mostly a deepwater habitat system, with marine wetlands limited tointertidal areas like beaches, rocky shores and some coral reefs. In subsequentsections of this notice, the term <T3>marine water</T3> means the same as <T3>marine system. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">Estuarine System </ITAG>This term is generally applied to coastal wetlands (e.g., tidal marshes),mangrove swamps, and intertidal flats, as well as deepwater bays, soundsand coastal rivers. In subsection sections of this notice, the term <T3>estuarine water</T3> means the same as <T3>estuarine system. </T3>B. New Coastal Subcategory Candidate Definitions The Agency has re-evaluated the current definition of the coastal subcategoryand has examined two alternative definitions that are explained below.The Agency has tentatively concluded that salinity of the waters in whichthe wellhead of the regulated facilities is located should be the basisfor any new definition of the coastal subcategory. The Agency currentlyintends to include a definition of coastal based on salinity (referredto as the <T3>water classification definition</T3>) if it formally proposes rulesin this subcategory. Through the use of USFWS maps, a <T3>salinity line</T3> can be drawn to delineate freshwater from marineand estuarine waters. Over time, the salinity line will change due to variationsin salinity. To keep the salinity line fixed, the applicability of thecoastal geographical area would be defined by a set distance from the coastline or possibly by a set of longitude and latitude coordinates. Facilitieslocated in freshwater would be regulated separately or reclassified intothe onshore subcategory. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Alternatives Considered </ITAG><T3>a. ``Water Classification'' Definition. </T3>The Agency has considereda definition of the coastal subcategory based upon the USFWS water classificationsystem described above. Under this approach, the coastal subcategory wouldbe defined to include facilities located landward of the inner boundaryof the territorial seas and located in marine waters or estuarine waters.The inner boundary of the territorial seas is defined at section 502(8)of the Clean Water Act as:<ITAG tagnum="21">*** the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coastalwhich is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seawardlimit of inland waters.</ITAG>The classification of the facility would be based upon the wellhead location.The final definition would exclude those facilities over freshwater. Itwould also exclude facilities located in inland saline and fresh waters.Such facilities would be placed in the onshore subcategory or possiblya new subcategory. <T3>b. ``Tidal Influence'' Definition.</T3> Tidal influence also was consideredas the basis for a possible redefinition of the coastal subcategory. Tidalbodies of water landward of the inner boundary of territorial seas wouldinclude bays, estuaries, sounds, mudflats, sloughs, wetlands and similarareas. Some states have defined the inland limits of tidal influence basedon flux indicators (e.g., segment identification maps for Texas River andcoastal basins, Texas Water Commission 1985.) Defining coastal in termsof the tidal influence would result in freshwater, marine and estuarinewaters being included in the same classification. Like the current definition, a tidal influence definition would make nodistinction between freshwater and marine and estuarine waters for regulatorypurposes, nor would it take into account their dissimilarities. Therefore,the Agency tentatively has rejected ``tidal influence'' as a candidatebasis for a revised coastal subcategory definition. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Preferred Approach: ``Water Classification'' Definition </ITAG>The Agency prefers to redefine the coastal subcategory according to thewater classification definition. While the Agency would be using the chemicalcharacteristics of water as a basis for defining the geographical areato be considered as coastal, these chemical characteristics would not beused as the basis for determining the treatment technologies to be consideredor for developing technology-based effluent guidelines in the coastal subcategory.Differences in salinity are reflected in the species composition of plantsand animals in marine, estuarine and freshwater. Marine and estuarine watersare a complex solution of salts dominated by sodium chloride (NaCl). Marinewater has salinity values which exceed 30 parts per thousand with littleor no dilution except outside the mouths of estuaries, whereas the salinityof estuarine waters salinities range from greater than 40 parts per thousandto 0.5 parts per thousand. In any given area, salinity of estuarine watermay be variable or it may be relatively stable. Freshwater, however, exhibitsno such changes in its composition with respect to salinity. Although thesalinity of estuarine water varies, it is restrained to a given range ofvalues and does not become freshwater. Marine and estuarine waters also differ in hydrographic characteristicsthat are of great biological significance. The hydrographic characteristicsare: salinity stratification, oxygen depletion and accumulation of hydrogensulfide in the deeper stratification layers. The term <T3>salinity stratification</T3> refers to the formation of layers of waterthat differ in salinity. At the same temperature, water with higher saltcontent is heavier than less concentrated water. If waters of differentsalt content are in contact with one another, the water with the highersalt concentration will sink to the bottom. Even with turbulent mixingof the waters and diffusion of the salt, the formation of several layersof differing salt content still occurs. Haline (the term haline refersto ocean salts) stratification does not occur in freshwater but does occurin both marine and estuarine waters. In marine waters, salinity differencescan be one part per thousand for every 100 meters depth, whereas in estuarinewaters, salinity gradients can rise to 10-70 times that amount. Halinestratification prevents the vertical exchange of water masses, which leadsto oxygen deficiency and an abundance of hydrogen sulfide in the lowerlayers. Oxygen depletion and the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide occurwhen haline stratification is permanent or persists over long periods oftime. The Agency's preferred definition of the coastal subcategory would excludeinland saline waters from the coastal subcategory because the chemistryof saline inland water differs appreciably from that of marine and estuarinesea water. Facilities located in inland saline water would be reclassified,possibly to the onshore subcategory. Inland waters have ionic ratios whichusually differ appreciably from those in the sea. They exhibit great chemicaldiversity, a wide variation in physical conditions such as temperature,and often possess a relative impermanence of surface water. The salinityof inland water is dominated by four major cations (positively chargedions), calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; and three major anions(negatively charged ions), carbonate, sulfate, and chloride. The salinityof inland waters is affected by the interactions among precipitation, surfacerunoff, groundwater flow, evaporation and sometimes evapotranspirationby plants. Freshwater inland lakes and wetlands (e.g., the Great Lakes)would not be included in the coastal subcategory. The Agency currentlyknows of no oil and gas activity in saline inland lakes but solicits commenton the existence of facilities which are. If the Agency adopts its preferred definition, facilities that are locatedin freshwater and are currently classified as coastal would be reclassifiedas onshore, unless the Agency regulates them in a new subcategory. TheAgency is aware of cases in which produced waters, which are saline, havecaused documented environmental damage when discharged into freshwaterbodies. The introduction of this saline water into freshwater brings abouta distinct change in the environment for the flora and fauna which inhabitfreshwater areas. Documented damage has included the severe degradationof the water and damage to native fish and vegetation. In one particularcase discharges into Petronilla Creek in Texas were allowed. All freshwaterspecies of fish and vegetation died as a result of exposure to the producedwaters. As a result of such severe environmental damage, in 1986, the TexasRailroad Commission ordered a halt to the discharge of produced water inPetronilla Creek. Facilities located in freshwater may have a greater availability of treatmentoptions as a result of their location adjacent to or near land. If suchfacilities have the same treatment technologies available to them as onshorefacilities, then they could be considered for inclusion in the onshoresubcategory. If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, it will examinethe technological and economic achievability of such a regulatory classification.The Agency solicits comment on this approach. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Facilities on Islands</ITAG>There are facilities on islands (man-made and natural) that are surroundedby marine or estuarine water. In the Beaufort Sea, man-made islands existbut are not permanent structure. In other areas of Alaska, there are gravelislands which are not necessarily permanent but are also surrounded bymarine or estuarine waters. The Agency is considering classifying thesefacilities as onshore because such facilities have the same technologiesavailable to them as onshore facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Transport of Waste Streams Across Subcatetory Boundaries</ITAG>In most instances the location of an affected facility and the point ofdischarge of pollutants from that facility will be within the same subcategory.However, in some instances the facility may be located in the geographicarea covered by one subcategory of the oil and gas extraction regulationsbut its waste streams are discharged in a geographic area covered by adifferent subcategory. For example, an oil well located in estuarine waterscould have a separation unit located onshore. Similarly, the produced waterfrom an onshore well could be transferred to a coastal treatment unit andthen discharged.The Agency is considering adopting a regulatory approach that would makethe more stingent subcategory regulations applicable in circumstances wherepollutants are transported across subcategory boundaries. The Agency solicitscomment on this approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Possible Subdivisions of the Coastal Subcategory</ITAG>Subdivision of the coastal subcategory may be appropriate based on factorsthat affect the use of a given technology which are not controllable bythe operator. These may include depth to which salt water injection iseconomically feasible, number and suitability of saltwater strata availablefor reinjection or other factors.A second alternative for a subcategory division could be based upon waterdepth in certain geographic areas. For example, facilities in Cook Inlet,Alaska would be considered coastal under the Agency preferred definition.These facilities are located in approximately 18 to 38 m of water (i.e.,water depths of 50 feet or more) and like offshore facilities, can achieveland disposal only through barging.EPA is specifically inviting comments on whether such subdivisons are necessaryor appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Coastal Subcategory Profile Approach</ITAG>This section describes the steps that the Agency has already taken to developa preliminary profile of the coastal oil and gas extraction industry (basedupon the water classification definition.) This profile was developed toaid the Agency in characterizing such aspects of the industry as the numberof facilities located in marine and estuarine water, the distribution offacilities by state, amounts of oil, gas and water that are produced byfacilities in this subcategory, as well as other physical characteristics.If EPA proceeds with this rulemaking, it will use this profile and informationincluded in public comments received on this notice to assist in developinga definition of the coastal subcategory. This section also outlines theAgency's plans to further charaterize coastal facilities through the useof U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service maps. The Agency solicits comment onadditional sources of data that could be used in future profiling effortsand on the preliminary profile results that are presented by the Agency.A. Description of Field DataThe Agency has purchased from Petroleum Information Inc., annual data forthe years 1978 to 1986 for oil and gas fields in the counties which borderthe coasts of; Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,and Texas. The Agency's preferred definition, however, would apply to allstates located along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, as well asAlaska and Hawaii. The Agency is aware that there may be facilities locatedin the coastal counties of other states and will be collecting additonalinformation on these facilities. In addition, the Agency solicits informationon the existence of facilities in coastal counties which were not includedin the preliminary profile.The Agency has used these data to develop a preliminary profile of thewells which would be affected by any rulemaking in the coastal subcategoryand will continue to use the data in further analyses of the coastal subcategory.To supplement the data obtained from Petroleum Information Inc. and othersources, the Agency would issue a questionnaire to the industry under section308 of the Clean Water Act if it proceeds with this rulemaking.The Petroleum Informaiton, Inc. database generally contains informationon the following list of attributes for each oil and gas field:<ITAG tagnum="25">state code,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">district code,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">field code,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">production year,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">county code,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">operator code,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">county name,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">state name,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">field reservoir name,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">field/reservoir centroid (by longitude and latitude),</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">year production began,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">number of oil wells in field,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">number of gas wells in field,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">annual oil production,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">annual gas production,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">annual water production,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">cumulative oil produced during lifetime of well,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">cumulative gas produced during lifetime of well,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">cumulative water produced during lifetime of well,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">year of first production, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">average well depth.</ITAG>B. Estimation Procedures for Profiling the Coastal SubcategoryThe Agency's initial analysis of the coastal subcategory has involved theidentification of oil and gas extraction fields in the coastal countiesof states which border the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts includingAlaska and Hawaii. Through the use of the Agency's STORET computer system,the center of each field/reservoir (centroid) by longitude and latitudeis contained in the Petroleum Information Inc. data base and have beenplotted on maps. These maps show rivers, lakes and streams as well as counties.These maps, however, do not indicate the water quality characteristics(such as salinity) of the water bodies. USFWS has produced a series ofthe 1:24000 scale which clearly delineate the various water systems (e.g.,marine, estuarine.) The Agency intends to conduct further work to identifyactivities within the coastal subcategory based upon the most recent USFWS1:24000 scale maps and comments received on this notice. For the purposes of developing a preliminary profile, the Agency has performeda coastal county-by-county analysis of oil and gas activities. The profileindicates that there are 23,891 oil wells and 6,777 gas wells in thesecounties. The county-by-county analyses do not differentiate between onshoreand coastal segments (i.e., freshwater, marine water or estuarine water)or between stripper oil wells and marginal gas wells. The Agency is awarethat the county analyses generate an overestimate of the the actual numberof facilities which would be considered coastal under its preferred definition.The list of states and counties which the Agency believes contain coastaloil and gas facilities (under the Agency's preferred definition) is includedin appendix B. County-by-county information regarding oil and gas facilitiesis presented in appendix C. The Agency solicits comment on the county datapresented and on the existence of any counties in which coastal oil andgas activities take place (under the Agency's preferred definition of coastal),but which have not been included in this profile. C. Model FacilitiesThe Agency often uses model facilities to estimate industry compliancecosts and economic impacts of regulations. The number of model facilitieswill be determined as the profile of existing facilities nears completion.If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, it will define model facilitiesin terms of characteristics likely to influence compliance costs and economicimpacts. The characteristics of a model facility may not be the same forestimating compliance costs for drilling muds and cuttings and producedwater. Accordingly, it is likely that there will be several model facilitiesfor each different waste stream as well as separate model facilities forstripper and marginal gas wells.For muds and cuttings, model facilities may be individual wells or fieldsof various sizes. Some factors influencing costs (other than control technologies)are the volume of material to be controlled (e.g., barrels of muds andcuttings) and the transport distances involved. The model facilities willtake into consideration economies of scale that result from (1) the numberof wells per field; and (2) the regional location of the facilities, e.g.,Gulf coast, California, Alaska, where these regional locations affect thechoice and cost of technologies and the economic impacts. For produced water, the model facility may be the oil-water separationunit. At a maximum there would be a separation facility for each well.Typically, a facility with several wells or a group of facilities is servicedby a single separation facility. For example, there may be a separationfacility for each field, or each operator, or each reservoir. The Agency has received some information on the industry's use of mudsand cuttings treatment, disposal and oil-water separation facilities includingfeatures that determine the number of wells serviced by a separation unit.In previous offshore rulemakings, the Agency has estimated compliance costson a per-platform basis with respect to the platform's size (e.g., 4-well,12-well and the like.) See 53 FR 41356 (October 21, 1988) and 50 FR 34593(August 26, 1985). The Agency solicits comment on the applicability ofthis offshore information to rulemaking for the coastal subcategory. TheAgency solicits information on the similarities between the coastal, offshoreand onshore industries as well as characteristics which make coastal facilitiesunique. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Stripper Oil Wells and Marginal Gas Wells</ITAG>A. Stripper Oil WellsStripper oil wells are currently defined at 40 CFR 435.60 as:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * those onshore facilities which produce 10 barrels per well percalendar day or less of crude oil and which are operating at the maximumfeasible rate of production and in accordance with recognized conservationpractices.</ITAG>The term onshore for this subcategory was defined as:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * all lands areas landward of the inner boundary of the territorialseas as defined in 40 CFR 125.1(gg).</ITAG>The onshore subcategory regulations specifically exempt stripper oil wellsfrom the zero discharge requirement that applies to other onshore facilities(40 CFR 435.30), whereas stripper oil wells covered by the coastal subcategoryare not exempted from the discharge requirements for the coastal activities(40 CFR 435.40 and 40 CFR 435.60). Although the Agency's regulations describethe stripper subcategory, no specific effluent limitations guidelines forthis subcategory have ever been promulgated. State and EPA regional offices have expressed concern over the lack offederal regulation of stripper oil wells. State and regional agencies receivereports of frequent and extensive damange to wildlife, vegetation, cropsand livestock caused by discharges from stripper oil wells. Stripper oil wells produce relatively small amounts of oil on an individualwell basis; however, collectively stripper oil wells comprise a large percentageof all currently producing oil wells. In 1987, there were 451,787 stripperoil wells which produced 446.8 million barrels of crude oil. Assuming aratio of nine barrels of produced water for every one barrel of oil producedby stripper oil wells, in 1987 4.0 billion barrels of water were producedby such facilities. It has been reported to the Agency that in some regions an estimated 70%of the stripper oil wells discharge produced water directly to surfacewaters or dispose of the produced water in settling ponds which in manycases overflow. In other regions, however, it has been reported that stripperoil wells reinject their produced water. The Agency solicits informationabout the treatment technologies and the disposal methods used for theproduced water waste stream from stripper oil wells.As part of this potential rulemaking, the Agency is considering whether(1) all stripper oil wells should be classified and regulated in theirown subcategory regardless of their geographic location or whether (2)stripper oil wells should be regulated under geographic subcategory regulations.If the latter approach were selected, stripper oil wells in the coastalgeographical area would be classified and regulated in the coastal subcategory,those in the onshore geographical area would be classified and regulatedin the onshore subcategory, and those in the agricultural and wildlifewater use geographical area would be classified and regulated in that subcategory.The latter approach would eliminate the now separate Stripper Subcategory,but effluent limitations guidelines would be established for stripper oilwells in each subcategory if the Agency proceeds to develop new guidelinesapplicable to stripper oil wells.B. Marginal Gas Wells The same classification and regulation questions are applicable to marginalgas wells. Marginal gas wells (sometimes referred to as stripper gas wells)are not included in the stripper subcategory, and they are not separatelydefined in any other subcategory. Therefore, marginal gas wells are notexempt from any applicable regulations. For example, onshore marginal gaswells are subject to the zero discharge requirement. In <T3>American Petroleum Institute </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 661 F.2d 340, (5th Cir. 1981), American Petroleum Instituteasserted that the criteria upon which EPA relied to describe the strippersubcategory for oil wells apply equally to marginal gas wells, and thatmarginal gas wells should not have been excluded from the stripper subcategory.The court decided that: <ITAG tagnum="21">EPA should examine once again the problem of stripper gas wells andconsider adding them to the final Guidelines for stripper oil wells. <T3>Id </T3>at 357. </ITAG>In 1987, nine trade associations representing oil and gas operators inseven Appalachian states petitioned the Agency to, among other things,reconsider the zero discharge requirement applicable to marginal gas wellsin those states. As part of this potential rulemaking, the Agency would defined marginalgas wells and then decide how to classify and regulate them, i.e., (1)to include them in the stripper subcategory; (2) to classify and regulatethem in their own subcategory; or (3) to classify and regulate marginalgas wells under each geographical subcategory. Since the definition of stripper well in the 1979 BPT regulation did notencompass marginal gas wells, the Agency is considering possible definitonsof the term marginal gas well. One possible definition appears at section108(b)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. 3318 (b)(1),which defines ``stripper well natural gas'' as gas from a well which produces``nonassociated natural gas'' (i.e., natural gas not produced in associationwith crude oil) at its maximum efficient rate of flow and at a rate notexceeding an average of 60,000 cubic feet (Mcf) per production day duringthe proceding 90-day production period. One advantage of this definitionis that the number, production, locations, and operators of every marginalgas well meeting the above criteria are known to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC). FERC has recorded these data on computer tapes thatcontain well determinations under the Natural Gas Policy Act. These tapeswould assist EPA in establishing the number of marginal gas wells.Currently, marginal gas wells in the onshore geographic areas are subjectto the zero discharge requirement and in the coastal geographic area aresubject to certain discharge requirements. It it proceeds with this rulemaking,the Agency may consider the appropriateness of this requirement for suchfacilities. The Agency would also examine the cost and effect on productionif there were a zero discharge requirement for marginal gas wells locatedin the coastal geographic area. The Agency solicits comment on the possible definition of marginal gaswells, an appropriate subcategory classification, and wastewater characteristicsand environmental impacts of the produced water from marginal gas wells.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Environmental Concerns </ITAG>Estuaries and other coastal waters serve as the critical habitat to manyspecies of fish and wildlife. While estuaries and associated coastal waterscomprise less than 1% of the ocean environment, these areas represent thebiological foundation of the entire marine ecosystem. They provide food,shelter, and spawning grounds for commercial fisheries worth an estimated5.5 billion dollars to the GNP in 1986, and support 17 million recreationalfishermen who also spend 13.5 billion dollars per year according to NOAA,1987, ``NOAA Estuarine Research Program Development,'' Estuarine ProgramOffice, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce.Seven of the ten most valuable commercial fisheries depend on coastal watersfor reproduction and survival. These include the Gulf shrimp, South Atlanticshrimp, menhaden, sockeye salmon, pink salmon, oyster, and blue crab fisheries.Seventy percent of the Nation's commercial fishery resources are estuarine-dependent.Commercial fisheries in the mayor coastal oil and gas areas are no exception:in the Gulf of Mexico as much as 98% of the fishery resource is estuarine-dependent,in Alaska about 76% and in California 18%. Sport fishing is also estuarine-dependent.Oil and gas drilling and production activities can cause a loss of habitatfor aquatic life in estuaries and other coastal waters. These activitiescan also introduce large quantities of petroleum hydrocarbons and otherorganic and inorganic pollutants which have the potential to affect estuarine-dependentspecies at their most sensitive life stages. Oil and gas production hasbeen identified as one of two primary causes of non-support of designateduses in Alaska's estuarine waterways at North Slope and Kenai Peninsula,and as a contributing factor to the water quality decline in coastal regionsof Louisiana and Texas. The direct and indirect exposure of humans to pollutant contamination fromoil and gas discharges also has the potential to occur in coastal areas.The coastal environment is intensively used for recreational activitiessuch as boating, swimming, fishing, shrimping, and crabbing and some peoplein coastal areas base a large proportion of their diet on subsistence catchwhich many be contaminated.The Agency is gathering more information regarding the effects of producedwater or drilling discharges on wetland vegetation as the potential fordegradation of wetlands is great. Interrelationships between the wetlandsand shallow water habitats are important in determining the productivityof these habitats for estuarine-dependent fishery resources. A number of factors may contribute to the effect of oil and gas dischargeson wetlands. The rate of dispersion is a critical determinant of the distributionof materials in the water column, and the effects on pelagic and benthicbiota. The fate of material discharged is influenced heavily by the dispersiveand transport energy of the ocean and other water bodies at drilling andproduction sites. In coastal environments, petroleum hydrocarbons resultingfrom oil and gas drilling and production discharges are likely to reachthe seabed and be incorporated in bottom sediments. In shallow coastalwaters with smaller volumes of water available for dilution and with sedimentloads higher than in deeper offshore areas, the potential for contaminationof bottom sediments by these discharges is much greater. Field studies have shown that the severity of impacts of drilling fluidsand cuttings is directly related to the amount of material accumulatingin the substrate. The accumulation is, in turn, related to the amount andphysical character of materials being discharged, and to ambient conditions,such as current, speed, and water depth at the discharge site. In highenergy environments, less accumulation of muds and cuttings occurs, andthe impact on the benthos is not as severe and is of shorter duration thanin the low coastal environments. In the coastal area, more material accumulatesand there is a potential for reduction in the abundance of some benthicspecies resulting from burial and chemical toxicity of the drilling fluidsand cuttings. Coastal areas include diverse and complex biological communities and aresubject to a wide range of changing physical, chemical, and biologicalconditions. The living resource communities present in the coastal areawill depend upon the habitat available in the region. Because coastal areasinclude land/seawater/freshwater interfaces, the variety of available habitatsand biological communities is considerable. The physical and chemical characteristicsof a given coastal area are dependent on the amount of fresh water input,depth, substrate type, hydrology, tidal action, and other factors includinghuman activities. The Agency is gathering background information on biological, chemical,and physical environments of the coastal regions impacted by oil and gasactivities. The conceptual models that have been identified to assess potentialimpacts of discharges offshore is most cases will not be appropriate forthe shallow waters of the coastal area. Ambient conditions found in thecoastal environment affect dilution, transport, sinks, and biogeochemicalavailability of effluent constituents differently from ambient conditionsin the offshore area. The coastal area will more likely require marinemodels, estuarine and bay models, in addition to river and stream models.If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, the Agency will project thepotential environmental impacts of oil and gas extraction in the coastalregions and pollution reduction benefits. In that connection, the Agencysolicits information related to the fate and transport of oil and gas pollutantsin the coastal environment and on the impact of these discharges on estuarinefish and wildlife. Appropriate models for assessing impacts on coastalareas must also be identified and developed if the Agency proceeds withthis rulemaking. The Agency is therefore soliciting information on thecharacteristics of oil and gas exploration and production in the coastalenvironment as well as on appropriate models to assess the potential impactsof these activities and benefits expected of the regulation. <ITAG tagnum="85">VIII. Technological Approaches to Controlling Discharges in the Coastaland Stripper Subcategories </ITAG> The Technological approaches to controlling discharges in the coastaland stripper subcategories are divided into two sections in order to distinguishbetween the major waste streams associated with oil and gas production.The first section is entitled ``Production Operations: Produced Water.''The technologies presented are those specifically considered for the producedwater waste stream of the coastal and stripper subcategories. Such technologiesinclude: reinjection, induced oil/water separation, carbon adsorption anddesalination by reverse osmosis. The second section is entitled ``Development Operations'', and deals withthe muds and cuttings waste streams for the coastal and stripper subcategories.The technologies which are presented include: thermal technologies (e.g.,thermal distillation and thermal oxidation), solvent extraction, disposalmethods, and product substitution. A. Production Operations: Produced WaterThe Agency, in considering BAT, BCT, and NSPS, would assess pollutant controltechnologies available for use to reduce toxic, conventional and non-conventionalpollutant levels in the produced water waste stream for both coastal andstripper facilities. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reinjection Option </ITAG>Reinjection technology for produced water typically consists of injectingthe produced water under pressure to subsurface strata or formations. Treatmentof the waters prior to injection is usually necessary. Such treatment mayinclude removal of free oils and suspended matter by oil-water separationand filtration technologies. The removal of suspended matter prior to injectionis usually performed to prevent pressure build-up and plugging of the receivingformation or strata. Biocides and corrosion inhibitors are typically addedto the waters to minimize clogging of the subsurface strata or formationand to minimize corrosion of equipment. Reinjection technology resultsin no discharge to surface waters. The Agency conducted two workshops with state regulatory authorities regardingexisting BPT effluent limitations guidelines for the onshore subcategoryof the oil and gas extraction industry. In these workshops, the Agencywas made aware of problems encountered with the implementation of the zerodischarge requirement for produced waters through the use of reinjection.The workshop presentations illustrated that wastewater management issues,regulatory approaches and operator practices vary by location. Diverseclimates, precipitation/evaporation rates, geological formations and otherfactors exist from state to state, and even with areas of the same state.One example of such variation is in West Virginia, where general permitsfor treatment and discharge of air drilling pit fluids differ by countyas a result of differences in geological formations. Similar factors mayaffect the coastal subcategory, e.g., reinjection might be possible inone coastal area while in another area the geologic conditions would makereinjection infeasible. The Agency solicits comment on such factors asthose mentioned above which may affect the applicability of the reinjectiontechnology for produced waters in the coastal and stripper subcategories.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Produced Water Filtration</ITAG>Fitration is the separation of a fluids-solid mixture involving passageof most of the fluid through a porous barrier which retains most of thesolid particles contained in the mixture. In mixed or granular media filtration,beds of solids like sand or coal are used as filter media to clarify wateror chemical solutions containing small quantities of suspended particles.Oil and gas extraction facilities employ filtration as a technique to removesuspended matter from produced waters both as an add-on technology to existingtechnologies and as a stand alone technology. As an add-on technology toBPT treatment of offshore and coastal produced water, this type of filtrationis incapable of removing soluable materials. Produced water, however, containspriority pollutants which may be in solution or in a soluble form and arenot removed by filtration. Therefore, quantifiable reductions in prioritypollutants due to filtration alone may not be achievable. Reductions intotal suspended solids, insoluble inorganics, and oil and grease beyondthe BPT level of control can be expected through the use of filtration.Filtration technology was costed for the 1985 offshore proposal (50 FR34602; August 26, 1985). For NSPS, the Agency determined filtration tobe technologically feasible for the control of conventional pollutantsbut not effective in reducing dissolved priority pollutants. It was alsodetermined that filtration warranted further consideration. The Agency has received some information regarding produced water filtrationprocesses on offshore facilities. In addition, the Agency plans to performsome on-site sampling and analysis programs at offshore sites to examinepollutant reductions, equipment requirements, toxicity tests and filterrun times. The collection and analysis of such performance data could resultin the development of a regulatory option that could be considered as analternative to zero discharge. The Agency plans to use these data fromoffshore facilities and apply them to any regulatory development in thecoastal subcategory. The Agency solicits comment on the applicability ofthis approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Induced Oil/Water Separation</ITAG>Induced oil/water separation, which uses hydrocyclone principles, is reportedlyeffective in the reduction of oils and organics. Preliminary results indicatethat through the use of this technology, oil and grease levels in treatedproduced water can be reduced to a range of 10 to 20 ppm. Induced oil/waterseparation is one of the best expensive alternatives to zero dischargewhich achieves significant reduction of oil and the associated toxics beyondBPT. This process is a possible technological alternative to reinjectionof produced water. It is currently being used on a full-sca]e basis overseas(for example, in the North Sea and Australia) and is being tested and implementedby some companies in the United States.If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, the performance of inducedoil/water separation will be characterized with sampling and analysis duringtest runs which would be performed by the Agency. In addition to the performancedata, the technological and economic achievability of the process as abasis for oil and grease and/or toxic limitations will be examined.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Carbon Adsorption</ITAG>The purpose of carbon adsorption is to reduce the levels of priority organicpollutants in produced water. Adsorbents are natural or synthetic materialsor amorphous (not crystallized) or microcystalline structures; those usedon a large scale include activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel,clays or molecular sieves. At ordinary temperatures, adsorption is usuallycaused by inter-molecular forces rather than formation of new chemicalbonds. This control technology was addressed in the 1985 offshore proposalbut was not selected at that time as a basis for proposed effluent limitations.Since that time, at least one domestic oil company has been using full-scalecarbon adsorption at an offshore platform. It is being used to comply withthe BPT oil and grease limit with reportedly good success. Performancedata thus far demonstrate that it has reduced oil and grease levels inproduced water to the 20 ppm range in addition to reducing the solubleorganics content of produced water. The Agency will evaluate this processas a possible technology for treatment of produced water for the coastaland stripper subcategories if it proceeds with this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Desalination by Reverse Osmosis</ITAG>In the reverse osmosis method of desalination, water is separated fromdissolved salts through the use of a membrane that is permeable to thepassage of water but not of dissolved salts. In an osmosis process whenthe membrane is placed between a brine solution and fresh water, the tendencyto equalize concentrations on each side would cause the fresh water toflow through the membrane into the brine solution. This flow may be counteredby applying a pressure on the side of the brine solution. If this pressureis great enough, the flow will be stopped altogether. The pressure requiredto balance the tendency of water to flow across the membrane is calledthe osmotic pressure.In reverse osmosis processes, if the pressure on the brine solution isincreased beyond the osmotic pressure, the direction in which the watertends to flow across the membrane is reversed and the freshwater passesfrom the brine solution to the freshwater side. To achieve this reverseosmosis, brine solution can be pumped at high pressures into tubes linedwith semi- permeable membranes, e.g., cellulose acetate. As the water passesacross the membrane, the local concentration of salt at the wall of themembrane increases. This causes the osmotic pressure to increase and theflow of fresh water to decrease. To prevent this from occurring, the brinesolution must be continually pumped through the tubes. The flow of freshwater through the membrane is proportional to the applied pressure althoughthe maximum pressure that can be applied is limited by the characteristicsof the membrane.It has been reported to the Agency that reverse osmosis is a process thathas been used on a mobile unit basis. The Agency solicts information regardingthe extent of use of reverse osmosis by the oil and gas industry in thetreatment of produced water both at producing sites either by mobile unitsor fixed units and by centralized waste treaters off-site.B. Development OperationsTechnologies applicable to development operations that are discussed inthis section are currently being evaluated by the Agency for applicationto offshore facilities. The Agency believes that these technologies wouldbe applicable for use in the coastal subcategory. A brief explanation ofthe technologies is presented; further explanation of these processes hasbeen published in the Offshore Notice of Data Availability (53 FR 41356;October 21, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Muds/Cuttings Thermal Technologies</ITAG>Since the 1985 proposal of offshore rules, EPA has received comments andcollected additional data on methods to control the oil and toxics contentof drilling wastes. Two types of thermal technologies have been identifiedfor potential use to reduce the oil and toxics content of drilling wastes:thermal distillation and thermal oxidation.The thermal distillation process has been adapted for use with some variationsby vendors in the industry. A brief description follows.Some thermal distillation processes involve exposing drilling wastes todirect heat sources such as electricity heated chambers or passage throughdryers while others employ indirect heat sources. Upon heating, the hydrocarbonsand water present in the wastes volatilize. The processed wastes are thencooled and slurried with seawater and are then discharged into the ocean.The volatilized hydrocarbons and water are condensed and separated. Therecovered hydrocarbons can potentially either be recycled for use in theactive mud system subject to meeting the specifications for oil additivesto the mud or they can be marketed for other purposes (e.g., heating fuel).If the recovered water meets effluent limitations for produced water, itcould be suitable for discharge. If the recovered water does not meet theseeffluent limitations, it may be appropriate to introduce it to the producedwater treatment system. If there are no production facilities at the site,the recovered water may need to be transported to another facility foradequate treatment or handling.Thermal distillation units are mobile and can be installed and operatedon a rig to process wastes onsite. Some full-size thermal distillationunits have been operated and tested on offshore facilities while othershave only been pilot-tested. Observations to date have indicated that thistype of technology can achieve significant reduction in the oil and toxicscontent of drilling cuttings.In addition to the hydrocarbon content from this technology, a dry solidresidual is also generated. The dried solids produced are reportedly suitablefor use as aggregates or fill materials. The hydrocarbons produced fromthe solid wastes are partially oxidized and complete oxidation (combustion)can be obtained by passing the hydrocarbons through an oxidation chamber(afterburner).Direct thermal oxidation can also be accomplished by passing the productionwastes through a direct-fired countercurrent rotary kiln. Kilns are usedin place of ordinary rotary dryers when the wall temperature will exceedthat tolerable by bare sheet metal (710.6 anddegrees;F to 800 anddegrees;Ffor carbon steel.) In this process, the production wastes are thermallyoxidized at temperatures typically in the range of 1600 anddegrees;F to 2500anddegrees;F.Due to the scale of the equipment required, use of the thermal oxidationprocess may not be possible for coastal facilities nor may it be able tobe moved from site to site. However, the drilling wastes could be transportedto a land-based facility for processing.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Muds/Cuttings Solvent Extraction Technology</ITAG>Solvent extraction technology has been developed to treat drilling wastes.Drilling wastes enter an extraction column and are contacted with solventto extract the oil. The oil-laden solvent flows from the extractor columnto an evaporator, a separation column, and a separator where the oil andsolvent are separated. The oil phase flows to the fluidizing oil holdingtank and the solvent is recycled to the process.Two types of solvent identified by the Agency have been used in the solventextraction processes, chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide. Either typeof solvent will reportedly serve the operational needs of the process.Although the solvents are used and recovered in a closed-type system, thereis potential for some solvent loss to the atmosphere.The Agency is particularly concerned about the potential for losses ofchlorofluorocarbon-type solvents from these processes to the atmospherebecause they contribute to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer,and the Agency has recently limited their production (53 FR 30566; August12, 1988). The Agency is therefore soliciting comment and additional informationto assess this potential, to quantify the rate and amounts of such losses,and to determine whether there are acceptable alternatives to use insteadof chlorofluorocarbon-type solvents in these processes. The Agency willparticularly focus on solvent extraction technology that does not employchlorofluorocarbons as the extraction medium.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Muds/Cuttings Disposal Methods</ITAG>If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, it will consider the transportof drilling wastes for land disposal as a basis for coastal subcategoryeffluent limitations. The Agency will consider such factors as land availability,the capacity of available landfills, distance of landfills from the drillingsites, impacts on groundwater quality as well as non-water quality impacts,and the trends toward more stringent solid waste regulations at the federal,state and local levels in its investigation of land disposal technology.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Product Substitution</ITAG>Recent studies have sought to identify drilling fluid formulations anddrilling fluid additives which exhibit low toxicity in the marine environmentand which can be discharged directly to marine waters. The Agency and theoil and gas industry have conducted programs to determine the relativetoxicity of certain generic muds.Similarly, the Agency and industry have investigated the use of low-toxicitysubstitutes for diesel oil. Research has been performed to identify materialsthat could perform the specific functions of diesel oil and also be acceptablefor discharge to the marine environment. Low toxicity (e.g., mineral) oilshave been generally found to serve as acceptable substitutes for dieseloil in drilling fluids. A significant difference between diesel and mineraloil from an environmental standpoint is the relatively low aromatic hydrocarboncontent of mineral oil. The aromatic hydrocarbon components of these oilshave been found to be the components most toxic to marine life.The Agency intends to further consider the use of low toxicity drillingfluid components and additives as a basis for limitations for the controlof toxic pollutants from drilling waste discharges.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Non-Water Quality Environmental Impacts </ITAG>The utilization of many treatment technologies results in secondary environmentaleffects such as additional energy use for pumps and mechanical treatmentequipment, the emission of combustion products from incineration processes,the generation of a concentrated waste stream or the generation of someamount of solid waste. Sections 304(b)(2)(B), 304(b)(3)(B), 304(b)(4)(B),and 306(b)(1)(B) of the Clean Water Act require the Agency to considernon-water quality environmental impacts (including energy requirements)in assessing candidate treatment technologies when setting effluent limitationguidelines at the BAT, BCT and NSPS levels of control. Other such factorsrelevant to the treatment technologies discussed in today's notice includeair emission increases, and solid waste generation. A discussion of theAgency's preliminary assessment of these factors is provided below andthe Agency solicits comment on these discussions. A. Energy UseThe treatment technologies discussed in today's notice each require energyfor equipment such as pumps, centrifuges, filtration systems, and thermaloxidation systems. Total energy use will depend on the technology selectedand its total use. It is likely that the increase in energy use will constitutea small share of the energy potential produced by the facilities affectedand will not have a significant effect on energy supplies. B. Air Emission IncreasesThe operation of several of the technologies being considered would resultin increased air emissions of hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and combustionproducts. These emissions are both controlled and fugitive. Fugitive emissionscould result from leaks and ventilation from diesel and/or gas engines,oil/water separators, gas flotation systems, storage tank breathing andfrom piping and connections. Controlled emissions are likely to resultfrom the thermal technologies and solvent extraction technologies. TheAgency will further assess the air emission impacts if and when controltechnologies are selected for proposal. C. Solid Waste The technologies being considered would result in a minimal increase insolid waste, primarily filtration and flotation system waste. The landdisposal of drilling muds and drill cuttings would not increase the quantityof these waste streams but will require additional disposal facility resources.Section 3001(b)(2) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)exempts ``drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associatedwith the exploration, development or production of crude oil or naturalgas or thermal energy'' from subtitle C regulation under RCRA pending adetermination by the Administrator either to promulgate regulations coveringthose wastes or that such regulations are unwarranted. On July 6, 1988,the Agency published a determination that subtitle C regulations for drillingfluids, produced waters and associated wastes are not warranted (53 FR25446). These wastes are, however, currently regulated under subtitle Dof RCRA and, in many cases, under state law. The Agency is planning todevelop new subtitle D requirements tailored to the special problems posedby oil and gas waste disposal facilities. The Agency considers the availability of adequate disposal facilities animportant issue in assessing the feasibility of a land disposal optionfor drilling muds and cuttings and will consider this aspect in more detailprior to proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Future Date Collection Activities </ITAG>If the Agency proceeds with this rulemaking, it would undertake a one-timesurvey under section 308 of the Clean Water Act for that portion of theoil and gas extraction industry that would be affected by the new regulationsin the coastal and stripper subcategories. From the Agency's preliminaryresearch, it appears that, unlike data relating to the offshore and onshoreoil and gas industry, data specific to the coastal and stripper industryis not collected by the federal or state governments or by trade associations.Although the coastal industry may be included in data collected by theseorganizations, the data specific to coastal, stripper and marginal gaswell facilities is not easily isolated. Additionally, the economic impactanalysis for this rulemaking would require gathering information not onlyfor major corporations, but also for many small, privately held companiesinvolved in the production of coastal and stripper oil and marginal gas.A questionnaire would be distributed to operators of coastal and stripperoil and gas facilities for the purposes of: andbullet; Updating and supplementing the current industry profile, andbullet; Establishing the quantity and quality of generated waste streams,andbullet; Identifying the methods currently used to treat and/or disposeof waste streams, andbullet; Obtaining data on the performance and cost of existing control/treatment-pretreatmenttechnologies, and andbullet; Gathering data to analyze economic impact issues.Prior to issuing any questionnaire, the Agency would identify the companies/individualsinvolved in coastal, stripper oil and marginal gas production, and wouldsearch for all available data sources to collect publicly available informationon the environmental and economic issues as well as on control technologiesthat may be applicable to this industry. These technologies may be fromother industries or from other subcategories of the oil and gas extractionindustry. The Agency solicits sources of publicly available informationfor use in the potential rulemaking. Candidate treatment technologies and waste handling technologies wouldbe investigated, along with others found applicable, to determine treatmentefficiency, treatment cost and non-water quality impacts. This informationwould then be used to determine the applicability of these treatment technologiesfor use with the waste streams in question. The collection of technical data would include field sampling of existingoperating facilities to characterize all treated and untreated waste streams.The information would then be used to assess treatment performance forthe purpose of regulatory development, environmental impact assessmentand economic analyses. The sampling and analysis program would be for appropriatecontaminants as listed on the EPA-ITD 1987 List of Analytes. The analyteson this list are the analytes that the Industrial Technology Division (ITD)of EPA's Office of Water would test for in its analytical programs, andinclude organic and inorganic analytes and various pollution parameters.For the coastal subcategory produced water and drilling waste streams andthe stripper subcategory produced water waste stream, the Agency wouldperform analyses to test for the presence of radionuclides. The Agencyhas preliminary information indicating that produced fluids can containradionuclides. The Agency, however, lacks sufficient data at this timeto evaluate the extent and levels of radionuclides in produced fluids.The Agency also lacks information regarding the likelihood of radionuclidelevels in drilling wastes (i.e., drill cuttings and drilling fluids). TheAgency will be conducting extensive analyses of these types of wastes todetermine the extent of radionuclide content for the offshore subcategoryand these results would be applied to the coastal and stripper subcategories.The Agency solicits information on radionuclide levels in the producedwater and drilling waste streams and also any additonal sources of information.Data would also be collected on the type of drilling muds used in the coastalsubcategory. This information would then be used to formulate a mud useprofile. This profile would be compared with the muds used in the onshoreand offshore subcategories to examine the similarities and differencesto assess if data previously developed for the other subcategories is appropriatefor use in the coastal database.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG> Executive Order 12291 requires a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) be conductedif certain criteria are met, such as an annual economic impact of a proposedrule totaling $100 million. Since no regulations are proposed in this notice,EPA has not determined whether an RIA is necessary. If formal proposalsare developed, the Agency will consider the question of the necessity foran RIA. <ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) requires an analysis of anysignificant impact of proposed and final regulations on small entities.Since the Agency is not proposing any rules in this notice, EPA has notdeveloped an RFA analysis. If EPA develops formal proposals, the Agencywill reconsider the question of the necessity for an RFA. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Solicitation of Comments </ITAG>The Agency invites comment on all aspects of today's notice. The Agencyparticularly invites comments on the following items: (1) The appropriateness of defining coastal in terms of the water classificationsystem developed by United States Fish and Wildlife Service. (2) The appropriateness of further subdivision of the coastal subcategorybased on regional factors that affect the use of a given technology. (3) The appropriateness of regulating discharges in the more stringentsubcategory when the pollutants are transferred across subcategory boundaries.(4) Whether facilities located on man-made or natural islands surroundedby marine or estuarine water should be classified as coastal or onshore.(5) The industry's use of separation facilities, what factors determinedthe number of wells serviced by a separation unit, and the average numberof wells serviced by a separation unit. (6) Whether estimating compliance costs on a per-facility basis by thefacility's size (e.g., 4-well, 12-well and the like) is appropriate forthe coastal subcategory. (7) Additional sources of publicly available information such as mailinglists of coastal and stripper facilities, waste stream characterization,and cost and economic data for coastal facilities. (8) Geological and any other characteristics that may affect the feasibilityof a zero discharge requirement for all coastal areas. (9) The use of alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons in the solvent extractionprocesses and also the potential for losses of chlorofluorocarbon typesolvents in solvent extraction technologies. (10) The non-water quality environmental impacts which are important inassessing candidate treatment technologies when developing guidelines coveringthe coastal subcategory. (11) The availability of adequate disposal facilities in order to assessthe feasibility of a land disposal option for drilling muds and cuttings.(12) The presence of radionuclides in produced fluids and whether theyare significant or not. The Agency requests any data or information regardingthe levels of radionuclides in drilling wastes. (13) The types of muds used in the coastal subcategory, sampling data onmuds and cuttings and sampling data on produced water from coastal facilitiesincluding marginal gas wells and stripper oil wells. (14) The appropriateness of reclassifying freshwater facilities into theonshore subcategory or a separate subcategory. (15) The appropriateness of EPA's use of the definition of marginal gaswells as defined by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 for purposes ofdefining marginal gas wells in regulations under the Clean Water Act. (16) In the instances where produced water from stripper wells is co-treatedwith producer water from higher rate production facilities, the Agencysolicits comment on whether the discharge from the co-treatment facilityshould be regulated based upon the limitations applying to the full-scalefacility. (17) At the present time the Agency is unaware of any offshore stripperoil wells or marginal production gas wells but solicits information ontheir existence. (18) The appropriateness of classifying all Onshore, Coastal and Agricultureand Wildlife Water Use stripper oil wells into one subcategory for separateregulation. (19) The appropriateness of including marginal gas wells in the same subcategoryas stripper oil wells. (20) The appropriateness of applying information and data regarding offshorefacilities received through industry and on- site sampling and analysisto those facilities in the coastal subcategory.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Rebecca Hanmer, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Water. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_glossary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Marine System </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Marine System is defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Servicein the ``Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the UnitedStates'' (1979) to have the following limits: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``* * * extends from the outer edge of the continental shelf shorewardto one of three lines: (1) the landward limit to tidal inundation (extremehigh water of spring tides), including the splash zone from breaking waves;(2) the seaward limit of wetland emergents, trees, or shrubs; or (3) theseaward limit of the Estuarine System, where this limit is determined byfactors other than vegetation.

Thesedata were obtained from Petroleum Information Incorporated (PI), a privateoil industry information service. These summary data include counts ofoil and gas wells and production figures for each field. These figures,i.e., the total number of wells and amount of production, are used as estimatesfor the number of coastal wells and amount of coastal production by county.The PI data base provides only well and production data by county withoutidentifying wells that would be considered coastal freshwater, or onshoreby any definition. Therefore, use of the PI summary data to estimate thenumber of coastal wells and the amount of coastal production results inoverestimates of the actual numbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to estimate the percentage of fields located in coastal countieswhich appear to fit the coastal definition preferred by the Agency, computermapping was done for oil and gas fields selected at random from withinthe coastal counties of each state. Although this method has not yet beenrefined to the point of providing detailed estimates of the number of coastalwells and amount of coastal production, it can be used to estimate an upperlimit for the percentage of coastal oil and gas fields, under the definitionpreferred by the Agency, which are included in the coastal county summary.The computer mapping was done using the Agency Storage Retrieval (STORET)data base of lakes, rivers, and streams along with the latitudes and longitudesof the centroids for oil and gas fields provided by Petroleum InformationIncorporated. The PI data base for 1986 contains 2,587 oil and gas fieldsin the coastal counties which are included in the coastal county summary.Longitudes and latitudes are associated with 2,100 of these fields, whichmeans that 19% of the data base does not contain detailed location information.Because a large percentage of the data base does not contain detailed locationinformation, a conservative approach toward estimating the percentage ofcoastal fields in coastal counties was selected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The conservative approach was to estimate the percentage of fieldswhich appear to be onshore and to then use the percentage of fields remainingas an estimate of the percentage of fields which are coastal. A randomsample, stratified by state, of the 2,100 fields with latitudes and longitudeswere plotted on maps. Maps for California, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,Alabama, and Florida were plotted at a scale of one inch equals 16 milesand any field whose centroid appeared, by visual inspection, to be morethan one mile away from any known body of water was considered to be onshore.The map for Alaska was plotted at a scale of one inch equals 52 miles andany field whose centroid appeared to be more than three miles away fromany known body of water was considered to be onshore. Alaska was plottedat the smaller scale because rivers, streams, and lakes were not availableand because those field which were not over the available water bodieswere clearly not over those water bodies. Using the forgoing definitionsof onshore, the estimate of the percentage of fields in the attached coastalcounty summary which are onshore is between 39% and 47% with 95% confidence.This implies that no more than 61% of the fields in the attached coastalcounty summary would be coastal under the Agency preferred definition.However, many of these remaining 61% will contain inactive fields, freshwaterfacilities, stripper oil wells, and marginal gas wells.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A detailed coastal profile will be developed through comments receivedfrom this Notice, through more extensive computer mapping, and throughthe use of 1:24,000 scale United States Fish and Wildlife Service mapswhich delineate freshwater from marine and estuarine water. The Agencysolicits comment on the accuracy of the information contained within thiscounty-by-county summary, the number of facilities which may actually becoastal in the county, the number of stripper oil wells in the county,and the number of marginal gas wells in the county. The Agency also requestsinformation from those counties not included in the preliminary profilein which there are coastal facilities under the Agency preferred definition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In these analyses, the term <T3>inactive fields</T3> refers to those fields which had no oil and nogas production during the year of 1986. The term ``inactive oil well''refers to an oil well that was producing oil during the year 1986 and waslater shut in during that same year while the term <T3>active oil well</T3> refers to an oil well that produced oil in 1986and continued to produce oil throughout the year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An <T3>inactive gas well </T3>is a gas well that was producing gas duringthe year 1986 and was later
