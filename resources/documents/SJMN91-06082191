But the state's reservoirs remain only about halffull, holding less water than in March 1977, the driest year on record.;   &quot;We are not out of the woods, figuratively or literally,&quot; state ResourcesSecretary Douglas Wheeler said Thursday. &quot;It will take a lot of catching up,more than we are likely to achieve this year.&quot;;    For the second time inthree years, heavy late rains have rescued California from an apocalypse ofinfrequent bathing, dead lawns and withered vines. But there is a differencethis time around: Officials are not simply distributing whatever falls in thebelief normal rains will return.;    Instead, they are putting some away for asunny day.;    Since the beginning of March, 2 million acre-feet of water hasflowed into the state's reservoirs. But that's only a little more than 5percent of the surface water Californians use in an average year. (Anacre-foot is 325,800 gallons, about as much water as a family of five used athome and work before the drought.);    With supplies remaining so low, thestate and federal officials who run California's giant water projects areconsidering only the slightest changes in the draconian supply reductions theyannounced last month.;    No water for farmers;  State Water ResourcesDirector David Kennedy said Thursday &quot;there is a pretty strong likelihood&quot;that cities will get more than the expected 10 percent of their normalsupplies. But that figure is unlikely to rise above 20 percent, and Kennedysaid it is extremely unlikely that farmers will still get any water at all.;   Federal officials are being even more conservative, refusing to considerrelaxing announced cutbacks of up to 75 percent until April 15. And even then,Bureau of Reclamation Regional Director Larry Hancock said Thursday, &quot;We'recertainly going to protect as much as we can in storage for next year.&quot;;   Officials say these decisions reflect the fact that reservoir levels are lowerthan they were two years ago, when planned cutbacks were canceled followinglate rains. But they also reflect the tempered judgments of people who feltburned when they released water and the drought continued.;    &quot;Now, for somereason, God has smiled on us twice (with late-season rains). And what are wedoing? We're holding it, we're banking it,&quot; said Marc Reisner, author of&quot;Cadillac Desert.&quot; &quot;That's a whole new attitude.&quot;;    So, what will it take toend the drought, given this new, conservative way of managing supplies?;   There's no simple answer: It depends on where each water supplier gets itwater, how much it rains -- or snows -- in that area, and in what pattern theprecipitation arrives.;    Too far behind;    And forget about it ending thisyear -- supplies are simply too far behind with too little of the rainy seasonremaining.;    It probably won't be over a year from now, either. Waterofficials say it will take more than one year of average rainfall to make upfor four years of below-average precipitation.;    As an example, consider theHetch Hetchy system that serves San Francisco, the Peninsula and parts ofAlameda County. On July 1, officials traditionally like to have 1.4 millionacre-feet in storage -- roughly a two-year supply.;    But the system'sreservoirs now contain about 400,000 acre-feet; even with melted snow fromrecent storms and the rain expected this weekend, the total is expected torise only to about 500,000 acre-feet by July 1, according to General ManagerAndy Moran. In a &quot;normal&quot; year, Moran said, the system's reservoirs captureabout 700,000 acre-feet of water. So even normal rainfall next winter wouldstill leave the reservoirs below average in July 1992.;    Other watermanagers offered similar calculations. Leo Cournoyer, water-supply manager forthe Santa Clara Valley Water District, said it would take several years ofnormal rainfall for the county's water supplies to return to normal becausemuch of the water is stored below ground, where it takes time to filter down.;   &quot;You don't fill that up like you fill up a bathtub,&quot; he said.;    It won'tbe any easier for the massive federal and state water projects. Hancockestimated it would take two years of normal rainfall to refill the federalsystem; Kennedy declined to offer a similar estimate for the state system.;   Breathing easier;  Still, the recent rains -- and state efforts to shift waterfrom farms to cities -- promise to make many Californians' lives easier thissummer. State officials said Thursday that they had contracts to buy 380,000acre-feet of water, primarily from farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin RiverDelta, for the &quot;bank&quot; created by Gov. Pete Wilson last month. Officials expectto conclude negotiations for another 300,000 acre-feet soon.;    The waterwill be sold to agencies whose supplies have been sharply reduced, primarilycities in the Bay Area and Southern California, and some farmers in thesouthern San Joaquin Valley.;    And while no one is saying so officially yet,it is likely the Santa Clara Valley Water District will be able to buy most ofthe 100,000 acre-feet it is seeking. And that will allow officials to limitlocal rationing targets to 25 or 30 percent, compared with the 45 percent theywere considering last month.;    Most other large urban suppliers say it's toosoon to consider relaxing existing rationing targets, including Moran of HetchHetchy, which imposed 45 percent cutbacks last month.;  Area Rainfall;                      Last Total   Year Normal   Last;                        24  for     to     to    year Season;                     hours storm(*) date(*)(*) date to date normal; Alma           8 a.m. 0.32 0.32  21.17      --   15.22     --; Bonny Doon     9 a.m. 0.60 0.60  18.15      --   21.08      --; BoulderCreek  9 a.m. 0.61 0.61  29.09  47.62   22.94  54.71; Campbell       5 p.m.0.21 0.21   9.59  14.06    8.19  16.21; Cupertino      8 a.m. 0.22 0.22  10.58 15.53    9.11  18.44; Felton         8 a.m. 0.37 0.37  24.35  36.95   18.76 41.92; Fremont        8 a.m. 0.16 0.16   9.94   15.02   10.58  18.27; Gilroy        9 a.m. 0.20 0.20  15.11       --       --      --; Los Altos      8 a.m.0.23 0.23   9.90   15.03    9.41  17.45; Los Gatos      5 p.m. 0.32 0.32 14.25   22.85   10.93  26.02; Milpitas       Noon   0.42 0.42   8.93       --   7.19      --; Monterey       8 a.m. 0.24 0.24   10.40  15.24   12.21     --; Morgan Hill    8 a.m. 0.44 0.44   13.35      --   11.90      --; Mtn.
