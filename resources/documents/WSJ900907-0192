The separate and seemingly contradictory moves reflect theadministration's ambivalence about aiding economicdevelopment in the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cold War.</LP><TEXT>   The administration, which only two weeks ago for the firsttime approved a plan in which Soviet rockets would be used tolaunch Western satellites, issued a statement spelling outits commercial space policy. The policy would allow Moscow tosell rockets, but prevent it from managing actual launches.   In coming negotiations with Moscow, the U.S. will insistthat the Soviets drop plans to launch Western commercialsatellites from Soviet launch pads; instead, Washington willrequire that Soviet rockets be launched by westerners from asingle site outside the Soviet Union.   The Soviets also would have to agree to requirements aimedat preventing them from obtaining the technology used in thesatellites it launches. Details weren't spelled out in thedeclassified version of the space policy that was madeavailable to the public, though.   Further, a White House official said the administrationwould set a &quot;goal&quot; of requiring the Soviets to sell theirlaunch services at market prices.   The U.S. believes it has a strong hand in negotiatingtough conditions on Soviet launches because Washington mustgive its approval for the launch of satellites usingU.S.-made parts. Nearly all communications satellites usesuch parts. &quot;We have an historic opportunity to cut a deal{because} the Soviets are so eager to enter the market,&quot; saida White House official.   Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for SecurityPolicy, a conservative Washington think-tank, said the policywould hurt U.S. rocket companies, which already face toughcompetition from Arianespace, the French rocket firm. &quot;Iwouldn't do anything to facilitate the Soviets' getting intothe market,&quot; Mr. Gaffney said. &quot;It's a real cannard tosuggest that there's any way to insure {Soviet} services arefairly priced.&quot;   The administration plan would limit Soviet launches to aproposed space port in Cape York, Australia, which would beoperated by USBI Co., a subsidiary of United TechnologiesCorp. A spokeswoman for USBI, noting that the White House twoweeks ago endorsed its plan to use Soviet rockets to launchsatellites from the site, said the company expects the StateDepartment to issue an export license allowing it to run thespace port within a few weeks. USBI said the first launchesusing Soviet rockets would take place in 1995 or 1996.   An administration official said that the Soviets objectedduring preliminary talks to the proposed U.S. restrictions.The U.S. plans talks concerning the Soviet Union and otherspace issues with the European Space Agency starting Sept.24. Currently, several U.S. companies and Arianespace controlnearly all the world's commercial launch business.   At the same time the White House was talking tough aboutlaunch business, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said theU.S. is offering the Soviets technology that can help themreverse the decline in their oil production. He said theknow-how can be provided by a number of energy-relatedcompanies whose chief executive officers he is taking to theSoviet Union tomorrow.   &quot;We're doing this for the benefit of both countries,&quot; Mr.Mosbacher told reporters here.   For instance, the commerce secretary said U.S. experiencein &quot;fracturing&quot; -- injecting certain chemicals into an oilreservoir to increase its porosity and flow -- could beapplied to Soviet fields with potentially quick results.   The American Petroleum Institute reports that Soviet oilproduction has declined from 11.7 million barrels a day in1987 to about 11.2 million barrels a day this year as aresult of inadequate investment and oil-field exhaustion.   Among the energy firms represented in the U.S. businessdelegation are Chevron Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., TexacoInc., and Dresser Industries Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
