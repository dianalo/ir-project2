The comments by Machinists spokesman Charles Bryan contrastedwith a federal bankruptcy judge's ruling Monday that the court nolonger would consider an offer by commodities trader Joseph Ritchieunless it was acceptable to Eastern.   Company spokesman Robin Matell on Friday repeated Eastern'searlier statement that there no longer is a chance of making a dealwith Ritchie.   Bryan said the creditors committee reacted favorably to Ritchie'splan at a meeting he attended Monday in New York.   ``The creditors committee has been rebuffing and ridiculing everyeffort that has come forward, except last week,'' Bryan told therally. ``For the first time the creditors committee was thoroughlyimpressed. They had a lot of confidence in it.''   Bryan said the committee rejected Ritchie's bid, which issupported by the unions, only because bankruptcy law gives Easternuntil early July to submit a reorganization plan.   About 1,000 striking Machinists, pilots and flight attendantsattended the rally in a parking lot adjacent to Machinistsheadquarters. Afterward they marched along a street that goes pastEastern corporate headquarters.   Pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground workersrepresented by the Machinists in a walkout that started March 4 andvirtually grounded the airline. Eastern sought bankruptcy protectionfrom creditors five days later, and has since tried to rebuild as asmaller company.   The proposal presented Saturday by Ritchie's group included a$100 million equity investment and $210 million in union wageconcessions.   Bryan said negotiators representing Frank Lorenzo, chairman ofEastern's parent Texas Air Corp., requested ``$500 million cash and$300 million on paper. So obviously what the Lorenzo people weresaying was, `Get lost.' They were not dealing in good faith, andthat's clear now to the court.''   Eastern's Matell described Bryan's comments as ``absolutenonsense. There is no basis whatsoever for those statements.''   Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Monday said Eastern shouldbegin negotiating with creditors about the company's plan to sell$1.8 billion in assets and reorganize.   But Bryan and Henry Duffy, national president of the Air LinePilots Association, told the rally that Ritchie and his backersstill hope to buy Eastern.   ``They are continuing very aggressively to pursue theacquisition,'' Bryan said. ``They think they're getting strongereach day in putting the transaction together.''   Duffy predicted that the creditors committee will not approveEastern's reorganization plan.   ``The orenzo plan overestimates revenue, underestimates expensesand has the most fatal flaw of all _ it doesn't have any people,''Duffy said to cheers from the crowd.</TEXT></DOC>
