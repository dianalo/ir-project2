The 60-39 vote against the amendment, after more than sixhours of spirited debate, indicates strong bipartisan supportto try to revive the Strategic Defense Initiative byswitching its immediate focus to ground-based rather thanspace-based interceptors. The debate was part of the $291billion defense authorization bill for the fiscal year thatbegins Oct. 1.</LP><TEXT>   The new approach, considered by many Pentagon officialsand leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee as perhapstheir last chance to fashion a politically viableanti-missile system, emphasizes protection against anaccidental Soviet launch or a limited missile attack by aThird World power. During the debate, however, critics arguedthat even scaled-back SDI plans threaten the 1972Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union.   Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), who introduced theunsuccessful amendment, said the armed services panel's SDIplan is built around &quot;a clear hint of abrogation&quot; of thattreaty. &quot;If we take this unwise and radical step&quot; to try toget around the treaty, he asserted, it could be &quot;one of themost serious mistakes the U.S. Congress has ever made.&quot;   Other critics urged senators against approving rapid SDIdeployment on the very day that the U.S. and the Soviet Unionsigned a treaty reducing long-range ballistic missiles.   In action earlier yesterday, the Senate agreed with aHouse proposal to eliminate legal hurdles currently barringfemale military pilots from flying combat missions.</TEXT></DOC>
