The advent of optical fiber technologyand the many applications of optical fiber for information transmissionhave sharply increased the interest in these investigations. Opticalfibers present a long optical transmission path and that path may traversedifferent adverse environments, including radiation areas. The long tranmissionpath provides increased potential for interactions between the opticalinformation signal and the optical medium. 10 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
