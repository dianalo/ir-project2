Professor Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia who was several times president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and is now its secretary-general, will seek answers to two questions.    In Tehran, which he reaches today, Mr. Subroto will ask under what conditions Iran would accept Iraq back into the OPEC production-control system. In Baghdad, which he visits Wednesday, he will ask if the Iraqis still are willing to return to the OPEC quota system -- possibly at parity with Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day.    These may seem less weighty issues than the ones being debated by other diplomats in other places in the wake of the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. But on their resolution hangs the price of oil -- and possibly the very future of OPEC. &quot;Now, we will have the clue of what's going to be happening in the next several months&quot; in oil markets, says Antonio M. Szabo, manager of petroleum planning at Bonner andamp; Moore Market Consultants.    The industry is divided on the probable effect on world oil markets if the war between Iran and Iraq really has ended. The most widely held theory, supported by many in OPEC, is that cessation of hostilities will bring new cohesion to the cartel, helping it to regain a grip on world oil prices.    OPEC has been torn by the eight-year conflict between two of its founding members. And the idea is that now its high level of production -- recently reaching the year's peak of 20 million barrels a day -- can be reduced to firm prices. Mr. Subroto, who recently began a &quot;fact-finding&quot; tour of all the OPEC nations, estimates the possible reductions to be as much as one million barrels a day.    But Iraq, which would draw a huge share of the cutbacks, still is to be heard from in this regard. The Iraqis previously indicated willingness to cooperate with OPEC's production limits if they were given parity with Iran on quotas. But that was before the cease-fire in the war in which they now consider themselves the victors. And the Iranians don't like the idea at all.    That brings up a second theory that another Persian Gulf &quot;war,&quot; a price war, already has begun. Both Iran and Iraq, it's said, will try to pump and export oil as fast as they can to rebuild their damaged economies and to regain lost market share.    But even if the two belligerents don't launch a pumping race, there is another possibility even more bearish for oil markets, says Marion B. Stewart, editor of the National Economic Research Associates Energy Outlook. He looks for a massive liquidation of high oil inventories, &quot;the dumping of hundreds of millions of barrels of now-unnecessary 'precautionary' oil stocks that had been accumulated&quot; by the world's refiners.    OPEC officials aren't saying what they expect from Mr. Subroto's stops in Iran and Iraq. But a senior OPEC official suggests that &quot;a positive sign&quot; would be official confirmation of the rumored Sept. 20 meeting of the cartel's price-monitoring committee of five leading oil ministers. &quot;That meeting will take place only if there is something to discuss between Iraq and Iran,&quot; he says.    Looking ahead to other commodities this week:   Cocoa   Producing countries that are meeting this week got a grim reminder Friday of how awash the world is with cocoa. Prices on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York fell $37 to $1,266 a ton -- the lowest level since 1975, analysts said. And prices could head down another $300 over the next few months, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.    The cocoa producers, meeting this week in Lome, the capital of Togo, will be mapping price-supporting strategy ahead of a London parley in September with the International Cocoa Organization, a producers and consumers cooperative set up to support prices. In general, the market's weakness reflects the prospect that the 1988-1989 season starting Oct. 1 will probably be the fifth consecutive of surplus production world-wide.    Added to that general bearishness on Friday, traders said, were prospects that the cocoa organization may balk at supporting prices unless some members -- the Ivory Coast and Brazil, particularly -- pay the millions of dollars in dues they owe to support the group. &quot;It's a bit of hardball&quot; on the organization's part, said Ms. Kaul. Cocoa producers are supposed to pay the organization $30 from each ton of cocoa they sell. But the cooperative, analysts said, is owed $68 million in dues, and one way to raise money is to sell off more of the cocoa it holds, further depressing prices.    Grains and Soybeans -   Traders will study a long-term forecast set for release late today by the National Weather Service that will signal weather conditions during the fall harvest. Some traders have speculated during the past two weeks that the dry growing season might be followed by an unusually wet fall that could hamper the harvest of the shrunken corn and soybean crops. However, some private meteorologists expect the same weather patterns that gave the Midwest hot, dry weather through the summer to continue through the fall, leading to cooler but dry conditions.    The stubborn ridge of high pressure that has blocked rainfall in the Corn Belt is not expected to shift far enough westward to permit heavy rains in the Midwest in the next month, said Michael Palmerino, an agriculture meteorologist with Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass. &quot;It will not be a wet harvest season,&quot; he said.    On Friday, most wheat, corn and soybean futures slipped lower after a week of volatile trading. </TEXT></DOC>
