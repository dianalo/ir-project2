Despite these achievements, the Area stillfaces a challenge to break even, after capital charges of 40M UKL. Engineeringand related costs accounted for 29% of the total costs and so must bemanaged in a more effective manner. This will call not only for improvedtechnical skill but also for engineers to accept a greater degree ofmanagerial responsibility. Face equipment design must be optimized, machineoperators trained to achieve maximum utilization and potential, mineraltransport systems uprated and component parts designed for minimum maintenance.Electrical engineers must ensure that the most cost effective tariffis chosen for each colliery. Manpower planning will be a vital part ofthe engineer's managerial effectiveness, as will increased financialawareness. Cost comparisons between collieries have already producedfinancial benefits. Heavy duty machinery must be fully utilized. The'team approach' to machine reliability, using delay analysis techniques,has produced significant improvements in production and productivity.Finally, engineering managers must develop talent among their juniorcolleagues and eliminate their own weaknesses.</TEXT></DOC>
