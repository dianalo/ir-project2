At least 20 people were reported wounded in clashes in theGaza Strip.   Also Saturday, a breakaway faction of the Palestine LiberationOrganization said two of its fighters sneaked into Israel fromJordan and started a gunfight Friday that left one Israeli soldierdead and another wounded. Jordan said it arrested the infiltrators.   Arab reports said Gaza protests began after Israeli riot policeplastered posters on walls in a neighborhood calling on residents tokeep the peace.   ``What's the benefit of a demolished house, a killed son?'' anArab reporter quoted the placards as saying. The army said it knewnothing about the posters.   Enraged Arabs gathered at a nearby mosque, calling for a ``fightagainst the army,'' the reporter said on condition of anonymity.   Protesters took to the streets, pelting soldiers with rocks,blocking roads and burning tires, he said. Demonstrations quicklyspread to other Gaza City areas and refugee camps, said Arabaccounts.   Merchants shut down stores and transportation came to a halt, andone witness said ``there are burning tires and barricadeseverywhere.''   An army spokeswoman said hundreds of Palestinian rioters in theGaza neighborhood attacked a patrol with stones, concrete blocks andmetal bars.   ``The soldiers felt that their lives were in danger and firedtear gas, rubber and plastic bullets,'' she said on condition ofanonymity.   The attack continued until reinforcements arrived, helping thesoldiers escape, she said.   ``As a result, three people were killed and 10 others wounded,''the spokeswoman said.   The army later clamped a curfew on the neighborhood, butresidents defied it to hold a funeral procession, Arab reports said.The procession was dispersed with tear gas, the reports said.   Arab doctors identified the victims as Fawsi Mohammed Bahid, 20,and Abdel Nasser Sherif, 19, who were both shot in the chest, andMajdi Kourani, 19, who was shot in the neck.   An Arab witness said Sherif hurled stones at soldiers 150 feetaway, refusing to stop when friends begged him. He said a soldierthreatened Sherif by pointing his gun, ``but he continued to throwstones.''   ``Then one soldier fired,'' the witness said.   At least another 10 Arabs were wounded elsewhere on the seasideGaza Strip, said doctors at two Gaza City hospitals.   Protests continued into the night.   Saturday's deaths bring to 399 the number of Arabs killed sincein the 15-month uprising against Israeli rule in the Gaza Strip andWest Bank _ areas Israel captured in 1967 from Egypt and Jordan.Seventeen Israelis also have died.   The official Jordan news agency Petra said authorities arrestedthe two infiltrators Saturday inside Jordan.   In Damascus, Syria, Fatah-Uprising claimed the two men weremembers of its breakaway Palestinian group. The group, which earliersaid the two men returned safely, later confirmed its fighters werecaught and warned Jordan not to harm them.   The two guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in southern Hatzevaarea, 70 miles south of Jerusalem.   Israel radio said just before the 10 p.m. clash, soldiers heard aman shout ``Stop!'' from behind a bush in English. The guerrillasfired assault rifles, then fled.   It was the fourth Palestinian guerrilla raid against Israel in aweek. Two other raids were in southern Lebanon and the third acrossthe border with Egypt. Five guerrillas were killed in Lebanon, andtwo who infiltrated from Egypt were captured.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat, visiting Budapest Friday, denied thatPalestinian attacks against the Israeli army in south Lebanon wereacts of terrorism.   ``Those who are defending themselves cannot be namedterrorists,'' Arafat said, referring to Israeli attacks againstPalestinian strongholds in Lebanon.   In December Arafat said he renounced terrorism and recognizedIsrael's right to exist. His remarks led Washington to open adialogue with the PLO.   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as a terroristgroup.   In northern Israel Saturday, about 100 Israeli high schoolstudents threw stones and firebombs at police as they participatedin a mock battle to prepare riot police for Arab demonstrationslater this month.   Israeli officials are worried that a planned strike by IsraeliArabs on so-called Land Day March 30 will turn into a violent showof support for the Palestinian rebellion in the West Bank and GazaStrip.   Each year, Israeli Arabs mark Land Day to commemorate the bloodyday of March 30, 1976, when Israeli troops and police killed sixArabs during a strike protesting government confiscation of Arabland in the Galilee.</TEXT></DOC>
