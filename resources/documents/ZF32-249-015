Hamilton after he sold his first company,Computype, to Harris Corporation in 1976.andP;  Computype had marketedcomputer-based front-end systems for small and medium-sized newspapers allover the world.andM;Since its founding, Xitron has specialized in developing interfaces,multiplexers and protocol converters, but it also has dabbled in some otherareas, including portable terminals using dubble memory (remember that?),andO;systems for receiving stock wire data, and marketing of typesetting softwarerunning in microcomputers.andP;  It has been well known in the newspaper industryfor most of the 1980s, but primarily as a supplier of peripheral products,not of mainstream devices such as printers.andP;  It currently is trying to forgea name for itself as a primary source of printers for final output, puttingit alongside some real heavyweights in the graphic arts business: Autologic,Agfa Compugraphic, Monotype, Linotype, Varityper and so forth.andP;  It also isattempting to spread itself beyond the newspaper market into areas in whichit has little or no previous visibility--a tough assignment for any vendor,but especially tough for one of Xitron's size.andP;  Xitron isn't the only suchcompany making this effort, though.andP;  Birmy and Chelgraph have similarly lowprofiles in parts of the market, as does Monotype outside the newspaperbusiness.andM;Xitron's initial foray into the printer world came in 1985, when itintroduced the Xitron Image Processor, a 300-dpi laser printer based on theQume LaserTen engine.andP;  Its first machines were developed to support the Coracommand language, complete with the full library of Linotype fonts, but laterversions also supported Compugraphic and Autologic.andM;A couple of years ago, Xitron released a 400-dpi, 11&quot; X 17&quot; printer based ona Panasonic engine, which began replacing old typesetters to produce finaloutput of newspaper pages.andP;  In particular, the Compugraphic version found anice market niche among users of antiquated Compugraphic Videosetters.andM;The 600-dpi Clipper is the latest effort.andP;  The increased resolution makes itsuitable for a much broader range of applications, including the desktoppublishing market and newspaper-quality halftones that weren't practical at400 dpi.andM;About the product.andP;  Xitron and Monotype both use the Hitachi engine--Xitronfor the Clipper and Monotype for its PaperMaster.andP;  We understand, though,that Hitachi makes certain modifications to the engine that aren't made forother OEM customers.andP;  Xitron won't discuss the details of the changes, butthey apparently concern the quality of output, not durability, speed or otheroperational features.andP;  We suggest that interested readers compare theMonotype and Xitron samples we are reproducing to see if there are anynoticeable differences.andM;There are no options for the Clipper.andP;  For $22,900, you get the printer with35 Monotype fonts, a 20-MB hard disk and two paper trays.andP;  The Clipperincorporaties a Weitek-based RIP with a 16-MHz 80286 processor and 12 MB ofRAM.andP;  It prints on letter, legal and ledger paper and can accommodate any twotrays at one time--an advantage over several other units we tested.andM;The Clipper comes with LocalTalk, a parallel port and a serial interface.andO;Ethernet is not available currently, but a Xitron representative said thatboth Ethernet and SCSI interfaces will be available as options by the end ofMarch.andM;Xitron sells for $300 a stand that we recommend.andP;  The stand is designed toaccommodate the diminutive RIP that accompanies the printer.andM;The RIP has a floppy drive built in, just as the Printer 60 does.andP;  This camein handy for installing software upgrades.andM;Once they are installed, all the interface cables can be connected at thesame time.andP;  The interface setting has to be selected via the control panel.andM;The manual says that you can leave all the interfaces &quot;on,&quot; but that you getfastest throughput if you turn off all but the one you are using.andP;  We didn'ttest this, but it maks sense if the device continually checks the variousports for incoming files.andM;Nitpicking.andP;  We could not get some of our PostScript test files to printuntil we got a software upgrade, which fixed the problem.andP;  The floppy in theRIP made upgrades much easier.andM;As we said earlier, we like the stand.andP;  But we don't like the fact that youthen have to bend down to make configuration changes and to read the statusmessages on the LED on the front of the RIP.andP;  We would have taken the RIP outand put in on top of the printer, but some of the attendant cables seemed tooshort to make this possible.andP;  We also didn't like having to crawl aroundinside the cabinet to get to the back of the RIP to install cables--acomplication that will be fixed for the next units to be shipped.andP;  Xitronwill make the cables more accessible by opening the back and providing aconvenient receptacle.andM;We had some problems printing our simple PostScript test files on letter-sizepaper instead of ledger paper.andP;  Since our downloader does not transmit pagesetup information with the file, the printer alternated paper sizes until weremoved the ledger tray and printed with just the letter tray installed.andM;We discovered later that you can make it print on just one paper size bychanging a &quot;mode&quot; setting at the control panel.andP;  We also verified that if theapplication software sends page setup commands, the printer will respondcorrectly by printing on the size paper you select in the application.andM;Downloading Type 1 fonts.andP;  Since the Clipper's RIP accepts Type 1 fonts,Xitron includes a special Mac utility for downloading them to the RIP.andP;  Wetried the utility and were able to download and print several Type 1 fonts.andM;Summing up.andP;  Xitron says that since the product's introduction in March 1990,66 organizations worldwide (including newspapers and inhouse typesetters)have bought one or more Clippers.andP;  The machine seems to be doing well in thetabloid newspaper industry, where some customers are producing full pageswith graphics in place.andM;Overall, we found the Clipper reliable; that is, it got the job done.andP;  It wassometimes remarkably quick.andP;  In addition, the print quality was consistentthroughout.andM;As we indicated earlier, marketing is a key issue for Xitron.andP;  The companysells the Clipper directly, but it doesn't have a large sales force, relayinginstead on dealers.andP;  In continuing to serve the newspaper market, Xitron hassigned a marketing arrangement with Mycro-Tek, a leading vendor of editorialand classified systems for small and medium-sized newspapers, under whichMycro-Tek will sell the Clipper.andM;In addition, in a move to get beyond newspapers into commercial and othermarkets, Xitron has an alliance with Locker Typesetting Equipment, awell-known supplier of typesetters and software products.andP;  Locker, which usedto sell the VT600 through a similar arrangement wth Varityper, says it isvery pleased with the Clipper.andP;  IT cites the printer's new technology,consistently good-quality output, ease in adjusting density, convenientdiagnostic features and ability to image within one-eighth of an inch of theedge of the paper (a larger area than the VT600 images), enabling it tohandle a tabloid newspaper page in one piece.andP;  (For high-resolution output onphotographic media, Locker sells the Hell BridgIt imagesetter based on aHyphen PostScript RIP and Ultre recorder.)andM;Besides Mycro-Tek and Locker, Xitron has a few other dealers, including twoin Canada, two in Europe and one in the U.S., with more under consideration.andO;Xitron plans to start its own European operation in 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
