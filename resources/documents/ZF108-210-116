The answer is simple.andP;  Sell time.andP;  Show designers thatthey will never again waste precious hours or days writing out type specs fortypesetters, sending stats back two and three times because they're sizedincorrectly by goons who can't read proportion wheels, training recalcitrantcopy editors to specify type, recorrecting color proofs because separatorstake out red to make the sky a deeper blue and instead turn it green, orwaiting for dummy type to demonstrate to clients that their suggestions lookawful.andP;  And so on.andM;Prove that using computers in the graphic arts makes life easier, smooths outhassles and gives artists the time to be their best.andP;  That's the pitch.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
