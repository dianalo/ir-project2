Gottschalk Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Like most stock market indicators, the practice of tracking sales and purchases by corporate insiders failed miserably at predicting the Oct. 19 crash.    But that isn't the only beating insider tracking has suffered recently. Some new academic and independent research has raised further questions about the value of tracking such insider transactions.    A large contingent of technical analysts, money managers and others closely monitor whether corporate executives and directors buy or sell stock in their own companies. The insider theory is based on the belief that these officials have a good idea of how their company will perform, thus their stock transactions may be a tip-off to the company's outlook.    Moreover, when large numbers of corporate insiders act at the same time, this action can predict a turn in the market, proponents maintain. Right now, corporate insiders are buying heavily -- indicating, if one accepts the theory, that the bull market will resume.    But research by two Cornell University finance professors throws some cold water on the use of insider information to pick stock highfliers, or the market's direction. Steven Carvell and Avner Arbel found that there was almost no net corporate insider buying of the top 25 performing stocks in the first half of 1987 or the 1986 fourth quarter. &quot;We found that corporate executives know very little about how their company will fare against the rest of the stock market,&quot; says Mr. Carvell. &quot;So I am wary of summing up all this ignorance and using it as a market barometer.&quot;    Hulbert Financial Digest, a Washington, D.C., newsletter that tracks the performance of investment newsletters, found that recommendations by the Insiders newsletter of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which has the highest circulation of this genre, underperformed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index from January 1985 through June 1987, the most recent statistics available. During that period, the Insiders' choices, which are based on the stocks being bought by corporate insiders, gained 64.8% after transaction costs and commissions while an investment in the Sandamp;P 500 index under the same circumstances would have racked up a 99% gain, says Mark Hulbert, editor.    Even proponents of the insider theory concede that the raw data on insider purchases and sales is plagued by a number of problems. For example, corporate officers, directors and major shareholders are required by law to report purchases and sales of their companies' shares to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to any exchange where the stock is traded. The reports are supposed to be filed by the 10th of the month following the transaction, but many are filed later.    The various newsletters that base their advice on insider trading activity also give conflicting signals. All work from the same SEC data, but what they include varies along with their interpretations. For example, the Insiders newsletter's &quot;insider indicator&quot; includes every open market trade by insiders. But Vickers Weekly Insider Report, of Brookside, N.J., limits its reporting to single trades of at least 500 shares of a stock and multiple trades that aggregate a minimum of 500 shares. The week before Oct. 19, the Insiders newsletter read executive buying as &quot;bullish,&quot; while Vickers interpreted it &quot;neutral.&quot;    Still, insiders still have plenty of backers. Arthur Micheletti, director of U.S. research for Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm, says market tracking based on insider trading &quot;has been about 90% accurate&quot; since 1980.    Insiders sold stocks in January 1980, presaging the market peak a month later, says Robert Nurock, a Paoli, Pa., technical analyst and newsletter publisher who uses insider transactions as one of the indicators in compiling his market index for the television program &quot;Wall Street Week.&quot; They also bought stocks early in 1982, foretelling the beginning of the bull market in late 1982, he says.    Insiders then sold stocks in the spring of 1983, predicting a flattening of the market later that year. They bought stocks in the summer of 1984, foretelling the rally of late 1984, Mr. Nurock says. In February, 1986, they sold, tipping off another flattening of the market in mid-to-late 1986. Last year, according to Mr. Nurock, insiders had been neutral until they began buying heavily after the Oct. 19 crash.    Anthony M. Sorrentino, a technical analyst for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., a New York investment advisory firm, who uses insider tracking as one of several indicators of investor sentiment, says insiders are buying their stocks now because they expect their companies to do very well in 1988. The stock market crash of Oct. 19 wasn't related to prospects for corporate profits, he says. He believes the insiders were more accurate in previous calls because earlier market turns were more closely related to prospects for corporate profits than the Oct. 19 crash.    And despite the crash, the insiders have had a good record overall, Mr. Nurock says. &quot;The long-term track record (of insider buying) is excellent,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of classic market indicators didn't foretell the Oct. 19 crash because no one can forecast a financial panic. Even the best market indicator can't call every market turn.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
