At a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the landmark ``ANation At Risk'' report, Reagan said a new critique from Secretaryof Education William J. Bennett ``will help us find the way.''   But outside the White House, several hundred teachers rallied inLafayette Park to protest the Reagan administration's policies andheard Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., call Bennett ``thesecretary of ignorance.''   Reagan said the school reforms pushed by his administration havebrought ``truly revolutionary'' changes to American schools.   He said the National Commission on Excellence in Education,whose 1983 report warned of a calamity approaching from ``a risingtide of mediocrity'' in U.S. schools, ``helped heighten andacclerate a wave of education reform in states and communities allaround the country.''   He said it led many states to install career ladders and meritpay for teachers, and many schools placed ``a new emphasis onquality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basicskills.''   ``This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which moneyhad been the only measure of progress in education and in whichwhile federal spending on education went steadily up, test scoresfell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions ofthe day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditionalstandards in scorn,'' Reagan said.   ``The key to what works is not money or being in a prosperousneighborhood, but establishing a direction ... setting standards,''the president said.   Bennett told Reagan the bottom line of his report, ``AmericanEducation: Making It Work,'' is that ``American education has madesome progress in the last few years. ... But we are not doing wellenough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are stillat risk.''   Earlier, Bennett told a news conference that the educationalestablishment is criticizing his report because ``they want awhitewash of the problem and they want a blank check.''   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.8 million-memberNational Education Association, told the teachers at the protest,``I don't want a blank check. I want him to sign it.''   She charged Bennett was ``whitewashing what the administrationis doing by coming out with another report that basically saysthey're not doing anything.''   Weicker, a liberal Republican who has battled against Reaganefforts to cut education spending, said, ``On the basis of the factthat you get what you pay for, Mr. Bennett is not the secretary ofeducation, he's the secretary of ignorance.''   The education budget today is $21 billion, compared with $14.8billion seven years ago. But Weicker said Reagan has sought $19billion in cuts in the last five years. Futrell and other speakerssaid Head Start and the Chapter One remedial program reach only afraction of the youngsters eligible for the services.   Futrell, standing beneath a banner reading, ``1983: A Nation atRisk. 1988: An Administration Asleep,'' said, ``The time has comefor Secretary Bennett and President Reagan to get out of thegrandstand and into the game.''   Two-hundred people attended the ceremony in the East Room,including eight of the 18 members of the National Commission onExcellence in Education.   Commission chairman David P. Gardner, the president of theUniversity of California, said Bennett's report ``was timely,helpful, tended to be constructive. I believe it could have beenwritten in a more positive fashion. ... I also think it was shortin terms of the role the federal government ought to be playing.''   Gardner added, ``But I think the conclusion was correct, namelywe have a long way to go.''   Bennett told reporters afterwards the NEA remains ``greatestsingle obstacle to education reform in the country.''   ``I am not surprised that they were picketing or demonstratingthere across the street, because they have been demonstratingagainst education reform since the very beginning,'' he said. ``Ihave re-evaluated my view of the NEA and each time I re-evaluateit, it's worse.''</TEXT></DOC>
