Both new algorithmsuse a &quot;shrinking&quot; operation defined by Levialdi and have time complexitiesof O(N log N) bit operations, which makes them the fastest local algorithmsfor the problem. Compared with other approaches having similar or bettertime complexities, this local approach dramatically simplifies the algorithmsand reduces the constants of proportionality by nearly two orders ofmagnitude, thus making them the first practical algorithms for the problem.The two algorithms differ in the amount of memory required per processingelement; the first uses O(N) bits while the second employs a novel compressionscheme to reduce the requirement to O(log N) bits.</TEXT></DOC>
