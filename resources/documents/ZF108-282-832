(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Nets take the strainandM;Multi-user database applications were first implemented on mainframes, whichcould handle the size and processor loads required.andP;  Recently, there's beenan increasing number of packages for PCs which provide database facilitiesand several include multi-user capability.andP;  Not wishing to be left out, thesuppliers of mainframe database development systems have brought out packagesfor PCs but these differ in the facilities they provide.andM;Of the two packages reviewed here, both DataFlex and Ingres allow the PC tobe used for developing and testing database applications which can then bemoved to the mainframe for final operation.andP;  Both will also allow single-userrelational databases to run on a PC.andP;  Ingres also allows the PC to retrievedata from Ingres databases on mainframes and users to manipulate it withfamiliar PC tools.andP;  DataFlex offers the alternative of running yourmulti-user database applications on your PC network.andM;Naturally, there are many competitors for packages such as these.andP;  Oracle isa well-known rival to Ingres and is also available for PCs.andP;  In the PC world,the famous dBase has a LAN pack for network operation.andM;Both Ingres and DataFlex make use of networks.andP;  Ingres uses them only toaccess the mainframe to allow you to log in and retrieve data.andP;  DataFlex,however, uses PC networks to provide access to data stored on a centralfileserver (see Database networking box) so that the database is multi-user.andM;Any multi-user system is designed to allow several users, such as salesstaff, to read and update the database simultaneously.andP;  There are, however,several well-known pitfalls to be avoided if the database is to retainaccuracy.andP;  The most frequent problem arises where two or more users try toupdate the same record at the same time.andP;  To avoid data inaccuracy, filesmust be locked (see Data locking box).andP;  This is necessary on mainframes andon PC networks if multiple use of the same database is required -- and it'sin this area of sales, stock control and general record management that theuse of databases on PCs is growing.andM;DataFlex 2.3bandM;Versions of DataFlex are available for DOS, DOS networks, OS/2, CP/M, Xenix,Unix and VAX/VMS.andP;  An application developed on one system can be transferredto another, as the commands and file structure are the same.andP;  In the presentclimate, where many users will almost certainly move from DOS to OS/2 orUnix, this is an important consideration.andP;  It's not just that DOS might goout of fashion -- the sheer size of your database may grow beyond that whichDOS can handle.andP;  But DataFlex won't help you to use your PC to access aDataFlex database on another operating system.andM;DataFlex doesn't have a true compiler so stand-alone programs can't beproduced with it (unlike, for example, Clipper).andP;  The compiler producespseudocode which requires a module to be present before applications can berun.andP;  So each PC running an application requires a run-time licence.andM;DataFlex is a highly configurable program.andP;  You can modify menus, add newcommands to the programming language and modify the source code of someutilities which are provided (they're written in DataFlex programminglanguage).andM;Dataflex is advertised as a user-friendly package; sadly the Install notesand procedures aren't.andP;  For example, one of the setup menus has the exit andquit options buried in the middle of a list of 10 choices.andP;  While notcategorically 'wrong', this sort of design is unwieldy.andM;In the modern world, PCs are often configured with great care in order tosatisfy various operational needs.andP;  It was therefore annoying to find thatDataFlex makes changes to files such as CONFIG.SYS without asking.andM;Any users coming fresh to a complex and versatile package such as DataFlexwill feel daunted by the amount of information to be absorbed.andP;  A good,computer-based training system can help to make users feel a little more athome with the system.andP;  Unlike Ingres, DataFlex doesn't offer any suchintroductory program.andM;The DataFlex primers (two volumes) are commendable but they expect you totype in a lot of data, which can be tedious for many users.andP;  DataFlex comeswith sample applications but these aren't used by the primers.andM;DataFlex is menu-driven and adaptable; you can re-organize the menus to suityour own tastes or needs.andP;  The menus give access to all the DataFlex programsand utilities.andP;  While generally sensible in operation they're a bit quirky --the down-arrow key cycles round the menu (returning to the top if you go offthe bottom) but the up-arrow just gets stuck.andP;  All the main menu screensprovide context-sensitive help.andM;Oddly enough, creating a database and its associated programs can all bestarted by laying out the input screens.andP;  You simply use your favouriteeditor (or the reasonably competent one provided) to create a screen imagecontaining explanatory text for users and markers (normally underlines) toindicate where the input fields will go.andP;  The content of each individualfield (numeric, alphabetic, date, etc.) is easily specified.andM;At this point you can use the AUTO-CREATE facility to generate the programfiles which contain the DataFlex commands to create and run the applicationyou're developing.andP;  As the created programs are simple ASCII files they caneasily be edited to extend them.andP;  Commands not available through theauto-create mechanism will allow you, for example, to make it mandatory toinsert some fields, to convert input to upper case or to check forconsistency.andP;  To assist with data entry you can also add help screensconsisting of several pages, easily accessed by function key.andM;Auto-Create will also ask which fields are to be indexed and will then createthe appropriate index files which will subsequently be maintainedautomatically by DataFlex during data entry.andM;Once you've auto-created and possibly edited the data entry programs, you usethe compiler to produce runnable programs.andM;Even after creation, it's possible to increase the number of fields in yourdata file by using QUERY (to convert data files to ASCII format), modifyingthe file structure and importing the old data with READ.andM;While data entry is good, the QUERY module which generates reports isn't sonice.andP;  Although it's menu-driven the menus are different in format from themain menus.andP;  The creation process lacks the simplicity of the data entryeditor; you have to select records without any visual display of the outputformat.andM;The facilities for graphics include both a set of drawing commands (line,circle, flood, and so on) and high-level graphing commands (for bar, line andpie charts).andP;  These can be called up from the data entry screens by the pressof a button, a helpful feature.andM;DataFlex supports over 20 different PC graphics boards including CGA, EGA andHercules but (oddly) not VGA.andP;  Over 20 different printer drivers areprovided, including Epson and LaserJet but not PostScript.andM;DataFlex includes networking support in its standard edition -- unlike dBaseIV which requires the purchase of a LAN pack.andP;  However, dBase scores in its(intended) provision of SQL server facilities which are absent in DataFlex.andO;DataFlex requires at least 384Kb of RAM and 1.5Mb of your hard disk.andO;DataFlex files aren't dBase-compatible, although dBase files can be imported.andM;DataFlex can handle up to 255 database files, each consisting of a maximum of16.7 million records, having 255 fields each.andP;  Programs can each consist ofup to 5,000 lines (maximum 255 characters per line) and can be chainedtogether.andM;The manual gives a good overview of DataFlex; useful tutorial sections areinterspersed with advice on the various DataFlex procedures.andP;  It has a goodindex.andP;  The Encyclopaedia details all the 185 commands and functions ofDataFlex.andM;The excellent Reference Card, in just 14 pages of easily readable lists,gives a complete overview of DataFlex commands, functions and structure.andO;There's room to write in the keys used for DataFlex functions (the keymapping can be changed if you wish).andM;Less good is the set of stickers for the keyboard.andP;  They have to be stuck onthe front of certain keys and while this provides flexibility it can lead toconflicts when other programs offer similar stickers.andM;DataFlex scores for being available on a wide range of systems and may suitthose who don't expect to stay with DOS.andP;  It's relatively cheap for such asystem and has valuable networking support which is important for anydatabase system that's intended for large numbers of users.andP;  Among itsdrawbacks, the lack of SQL may have increasing significance as this languagegains familiarity in the PC world.andM;Ingres 5.0 for PCsandM;Ingres, like Oracle, is well-known and widely used on mainframes andminicomputers.andP;  If you've already used it on such a central machine thenyou'll be pleased to be able to run it on your own PC.andP;  With links toexisting databases on these central systems you can make use of company-widedatabases or your own personal data with the same product.andP;  Ingres/NETprovides a simple asynchronous interface to connect to these remote systems.andM;Ingres/PCLINK provides not only the ability to interrogate remote databasesbut also the conversion of data to allow integration with popular PC softwaresuch as Lotus 1-2-3, dBase II and III and WordPerfect.andM;Ingres is a product which would seem to be well-suited to multi-user PCnetworks but these aren't supported.andP;  In this respect, it's less flexiblethan the LAN version of dBase and packages like DataFlex.andM;Ingres for PCs doesn't include the locking mechanisms which are essential formulti-user systems.andP;  This doesn't limit the single-user PC developer but itdoes mean that additional programming would be required to ensure asuccessful transition of a PC application to a multi-user system.andM;Installation is easy but you require at least 10Mb on your hard disk.andP;  Thesystem is delivered on 31 360Kb floppy disks and it takes nearly an hour tocopy these.andP;  3-1/2-inch disks are also available.andP;  You must also have 577Kbof RAM available after loading DOS.andP;  Therefore, 640Kb is essential and evenincluding a mouse driver in CONFIG.SYS could make it difficult to keep abovethe 577Kb minimum.andM;Unpredictable effects (some applications bomb out without a helpful errormessage) result from running Ingres without enough memory.andP;  Only theinstallation system checks that there's room.andM;The interactive tutor is a painless way to get started with Ingres; it'swell-written and carefully presented.andP;  It's easy to install -- thoughinstallation isn't mentioned anywhere.andM;The tutor is only a beginning and to follow it, there's the excellent240-page introductory book called Getting started with Ingres.andP;  It coversmost Ingres features, explains the terms used and explains what a relationaldatabase is and what it can do.andP;  There's a glossary and a comprehensiveindex.andM;The basic structures of your database are the tables (database files)containing the records which store data for your application.andP;  The relationalcapabilities of the database will link these tables together to allow you toretrieve (and modify) the information you need.andP;  Updates can be done in alogical manner and with a variety of tools.andP;  There are so many tools that youfeel spoiled for choice.andM;Fortunately, the main parts of the system use Lotus-like menus.andP;  You can usethe standard (classic) Ingres format if you like but PC users are unlikely tobe attracted to these.andM;Use QBF (Query By Forms) for simple operations like updating and retrievingrecords.andP;  It's good for browsing through the data.andP;  The Forms in question arethe standard Ingres variety -- either simple-fields or table-fields format.andO;These aren't suitable for standard data-entry applications so custom formscan be created with VIFRED.andP;  VIFRED is a special-purpose editor which allowsyou to create forms which can simplify common operations.andM;Although SQL is just an alternative to the QBF and VQL routes to manipulatingyour data, it's a convenient way to do it.andP;  SQL provides a comprehensive andsystem-independent language for accessing your data (see box on SQL).andP;  Ingresalso provides Embedded SQL for inclusion in MicroSoft C programs but this mayresult in some difficulties with portability.andM;For personal or occasional use the interactive manipulation of data isadequate.andP;  ABF (Applications By Forms) allows you to go beyond this andcreate, define and run applications without programming.andP;  The resultingprograms will run with Ingres on small and large computers making portabilityproblems minimal.andM;It's a while now since 4GL seemed to be the most indispensable term to makeyour product sound sexy.andP;  Now it's just another label to add to the list ofnecessary facilities.andP;  With Ingres, it's a language that consists mainly ofSQL statements (or the similar QUEL alternative) together with extensions.andM;Part of the Ingres/PCLINK module is VQL (Visual Query Language).andP;  It can beused to retrieve data from local and remote databases.andP;  Once a query issuitable you can use it to transfer data to PC format files suitable forfurther processing by Lotus 1-2-3, Multiplan, WordStar, Symphony, Multimate,dBase II and III and so on.andM;Four A5 manuals are provided.andP;  These include the reference guide which givesan overview of Ingres, a summary of commands and guidance on using most ofthe Ingres facilities.andP;  There's also a networking guide which wasn't suppliedfor review.andM;There's so much documentation that a map of the manuals (like dBase) would beuseful.andP;  Even more useful would be a reference card such as that providedwith DataFlex.andP;  A keyboard template would also be valuable.andM;An asynchronous version of Ingres/NET is supplied but there's also a versionof Ingres/NET which can use TCP/IP networks.andP;  TCP/IP is a networking systemwhich normally operates over Ethernet and is widely used by Unix systems.andO;This option wasn't available for review.andM;Ingres is a powerful system and extremely versatile.andP;  Many programmers arealready familiar with it.andP;  Lack of multi-user PC networking is significantfor those without a mainframe but the main drawback is the price.andP;  For newusers there are likely to be more attractive alternatives; Ingres issomething you get married to -- it isn't something with which flirtation canbe entertained.andM;DataFlex or Ingres?andM;If you've already used DataFlex or Ingres on mainframes in your company, thenyou'll naturally explore the possibility of using these on your PC as well.andO;While both of these products are popular in the mainframe world, we don'tthink that they currently justify any significant popularity in the PC-onlyworld.andP;  DataFlex lacks SQL and Ingres for PCs lacks multi-user capability.andO;Either would be fine for small systems on PCs but neither supports the SQLserver which is likely to become the main area of development for largedatabase applications on PCs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
