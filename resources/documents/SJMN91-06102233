Itis small but with real soil. I want to have something blooming year around,mainly drought-resistant perennials. Can you recommend some plants, and also avine to grow against a cream-colored shed that gets hot sun most of the day?;-- I.K., Fremont  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BEST BETS FOR THE LONG, DRY RUN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO><TEXT>  A There are many perennials that meet your need. Help can be found in twoexcellent publications, &quot;Waterwise Gardening&quot; (Sunset, $6.95) and &quot;Gardeningin Dry Climates&quot; (Ortho, $7.95). Both offer design helps and lists of plantsto consider. Help is found in designing and installing irrigation systems aswell. Soil preparation and follow up care after planting is shown.;    To growa vine against the wall of the shed you may need a support system, such as atrellis, for the vines to grow on. Install this before you plant.;    One vineto consider is the bougainvillea. Yes, I know, many froze this winter but somewere growing for 20 years or more before the Big Freeze. These arefast-growing vines and after the first year are drought resistant. They areavailable in many colors.;    Another good bet is Distictus buccinatoria, theBlood-red Trumpet Vine, which has red flowers on strong-growing vines withsuction disks on the tendrils. If grown without support, the disks can damagepainted surfaces. And lastly, the Carolina Jessamine (Gelsimium sempervirens),a yellow-flowering vine that blooms in late winter and early spring.; Q InOctober I was given a beautiful flowering azalea. By November the flowers,leaves and stems started to die. Now it looks like a tree in the winter. Is itpossible to revive it?; -- A.G., San Martin; A Florist azaleas, which aregrown in a mixture of peat moss and sand, need to be kept continually moist.If allowed to dry out thoroughly, the plant may die.;    You may be able torevive your azalea by cutting back to the main branches, leaving just stubs.Keep the soil mixture moist, moving the azalea to where it gets strong lightbut not direct sunshine.;    New growth emerges from buds in the stems andtrunk of the azalea. You may need to thin out the new growth if it tooprolific.;    Outdoors, plant your azalea on the north side of the house.Plant it in pure peat moss. Do not add any native soil as our soils are deadlyto azaleas. Keep the planting mix moist but not saturated.; Q We areanticipating the arrival of our first child in May. In his/her honor we wouldlike to plant a Eucalyptus sideroxylon. Will it survive if we plant it in May?What are ideal sun, water and soil conditions? How large should it be when weplant it? Where can we buy it?; -- D.A., San Jose; A Eucalyptus sideroxylon,Red Ironbark, should be available at any full-service nursery. Red Ironbark isavailable in five- and 15-gallon size as well as specimens in 24-inch boxes.Price would be a factor.;    Your eucalyptus will grow better if givensunshine and room (it will reach 80 feet in time) and extra water the firstyear until it is established. Then it is fairly drought resistant, needingonly occasional watering. Eucalyptus are pest and disease-free but are subjectto iron chlorosis. Applying chelated iron when the leaves show a pale orwhitish cast will correct this.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Rob Chapman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  578  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102233,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
