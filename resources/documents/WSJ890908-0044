Harry Copperman, president of the unit, said in an interview that the agreement is aimed primarily at West Chester, Pa.-based Commodore's Amiga line. Those are technologically slick computers that have had only limited success partly because Commodore's distribution has been weak.    Connecting Point has 325 stores, giving Commodore significant additional distribution on top of the more than 1,000 dealers that already carry its products. Mr. Copperman said the company has several other distribution agreements in the works, as well, although they would be on a much smaller scale. He also said the company is re-evaluating its current distribution network, requiring that dealers offer better service and focus more on customers in certain industries.    Mr. Copperman also said Commodore will escalate marketing efforts, largely with a more than $10 million ad campaign that will run in the fourth quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
