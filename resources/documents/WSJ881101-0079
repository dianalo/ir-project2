Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> SAN JOSE, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis pushed into the final week of the presidential campaign with a substantially sharpened populist message aimed at core Democratic constituencies.    A day after finally embracing the label of &quot;liberal&quot; in the context of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, the Democratic nominee used a speech at San Jose State University yesterday to make a strong appeal to women voters. His Republican opponents, he said, &quot;have been on the wrong side of every issue of special importance to American women,&quot; including abortion and efforts to achieve economic parity with men, while he has been advocating an increase in the minimum wage, universal health insurance, and more generous parental leave and child care.    None of Mr. Dukakis's positions were new. But as he struggles to overcome Vice President George Bush's substantial lead in the polls, he has begun delivering his message with a directness and a brio that has often been missing from his campaign.    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, sought to blunt Mr. Dukakis's new offensive with his own message to Democrats. &quot;My pitch here in the last eight days is to those good Democrats, the rank-and-file, the silent majority,&quot; Mr. Bush said at a rally in Louisville, Ky., yesterday: &quot;If you feel abandoned, there is a presidential candidate this year who has a program representing your vision.&quot;    Mr. Bush called Mr. Dukakis's embrace of the liberal label a &quot;breakthrough.&quot;    &quot;Miracle of miracles, headlines, read all about it!&quot; the vice president exclaimed. At a stop in St. Louis, he termed the label, &quot;The Big L.&quot;    The Bush campaign is likely to maintain this negative tone right through to the election. The Democrats &quot;can dish it out, but they can't take it,&quot; the vice president said in Louisville. &quot;I'm going to keep dishing it out.&quot;    Mr. Bush is continuing to hit his themes of support for the death penalty, opposition to a tax increase, tough words about fighting crime, and a vow to keep America's defenses strong. In St. Louis, Mr. Bush warned the audience not to take &quot;a dangerous risk on an inexperienced liberal governor coming out of Massachusetts.&quot; But he mixed his strong attacks with some softer language as well, and today is scheduled to give a speech at Notre Dame University that -- much like his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention -- will attempt to define him as an optimist, a family man and a leader.    Mr. Dukakis, with less to lose from taking political risks, seemed willing to venture into untried territory. Yesterday he delivered a defense of a woman's right to an abortion, declaring, &quot;I believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the exercise of her religious beliefs and conscience.&quot; He criticized GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle for telling a 12-year-old interviewer from a children's television program that he wouldn't permit her to have an abortion even if she had been raped by her father.    In the campaign's final week, Mr. Dukakis's schedule will take him from California to the industrial Midwest and Northeast, and back to the West Coast again. Dukakis advisers are banking on the hope that dissatisfaction with the race so far will lead many voters to take another look.    &quot;In many respects it's the traditional close to a Democratic campaign,&quot; said Dukakis adviser Steven Engelberg. &quot;Now is the time to say, 'These are the core differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.' We're making the appeal to traditional Democrats to come home.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
