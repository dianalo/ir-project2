Until a few months ago, Taiwan -- like other industrializing Asian nations such as South Korea and Singapore -- had pegged its currency to the dollar. That allowed Taiwan to compete more effectively in the U.S. against ever-more-expensive products of West Germany and Japan, whose currencies were gaining strongly.    As a result, Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. grew more than one-third last year to $13.5 billion (its overall surplus was a record $15.6 billion), while its foreign-exchange reserves ballooned to about $46 billion, one of the biggest monetary stockpiles in the world.    The previous policy of closely tying its currency to the U.S. dollar, combined with foot-dragging on import liberalization, intensified frictions with the U.S. So in an apparent effort to head off U.S. protectionism, the Taipei government intervened to strengthen its New Taiwan dollar, as the currency is called, against the U.S. currency.    The process has resulted in an 11% appreciation of the currency since the beginning of 1986, with the U.S. dollar now worth 35.43 New Taiwan dollars. But by using currency manipulation rather than trade liberalization to head of U.S. retaliation, Taipei has created serious economic dislocations at home, critics of the program say.    They say speculation in the U.S. dollar has grown rapidly, while a rise in money supply poses the threat of inflation. At the same time, the policy has spurred intensified pressure from the U.S. for an even greater appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar.    State agencies, meanwhile, are passing the buck for failure to solve the problems. &quot;If the government had taken some bold steps in import liberalization, it would have prevented a lot of chaos and uncertainty,&quot; says Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of Chang Hwa Commercial Bank and an adviser to the government on economic reforms. Banks have been particularly hard hit by the U.S. dollar's sharp fall. Foreign-exchange losses at the central bank and the three largest commercial banks so far total more than $1.2 billion.    As the local currency climbed at a record-setting pace in recent weeks, Finance Minister Chien, Economic Affairs Minister T.H. Lee and the central-bank governor, Chang Chi-cheng, have been debating the relative merits of continuing to gradually strengthen the New Taiwan dollar, or, alternately, of a one-time revaluation; and at the same time trying to find exchange rates acceptable to both domestic exporters and U.S. officials.    But that won't be easy, says a government aide. &quot;Who dares to say what rates are appropriate and to risk taking responsibility for the probable factory failures?&quot; he asks.    The U.S. is continuing to put quiet pressure on both Taiwan and South Korea to strengthen their currencies, but it refuses to specify what it belives appropriate exchange rates are.    Central Bank of China, Taiwan's central bank, has repeatedly denied it is aiming at specific currency levels; it says the exchange rate is determined by market forces. But it is common knowledge here that the bank buys an average $130 million a day -- more than 70% of the market's daily volume -- to regulate the pace of appreciation.    The most serious effect of a strong-currency policy, though, is speculation in the U.S. dollar, which exerts still more upward pressure on the local currency. For more than two months, until Dec. 9, the central bank bought enough U.S. dollars each day to fix the appreciation at one New Taiwan cent a day. The pattern was so predictable that speculation became a sure bet.    Edward Chien, deputy director of the Finance Ministry's monetary-affairs department, explains that the trend's predictability was intended to give businessmen a breathing space to adjust to a stronger currency. He concedes, however, that speculation is &quot;a major problem.&quot;    Critics also say the central bank's intervention poses the threat of inflation. Through buying U.S. dollars in the market, the bank releases tons of local dollars for circulation. That money and funds derived from the trade surplus are spurring money-supply growth to high levels.    So far, inflation has been held in check. Prices grew only 3.2% in 1986, largely because of low prices for imported oil. Moreover, Taiwan's estimated 10.8% growth in gross national product, the total value of goods and services, makes it the second-best performer, after South Korea, among Asia's four &quot;little dragons.&quot; (Hong Kong and Singapore are the other two.) The government is forecasting 8% GNP growth in all of 1987 and expects inflation to run at a 3% annual rate in the first quarter.    But skeptical economists say further sharp currency rises will wipe out much of the expected growth. The concern is underscored by the Korean won's relatively small appreciation of 3.2% last year. Korea is a major competitor.    Some economists say the government could have avoided the financial mess if it had sharply eased controls on capital outflows; that could have offset the trade surplus and taken some heat off the currency problem. Most of the $46 billion reserves, derived mainly from trade surpluses, are locked up in the central bank because the public isn't allowed to hold foreign money. </TEXT></DOC>
