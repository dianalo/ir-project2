In the House, which already has passed a deficit bill thatincludes a capital-gains cut, leaders bowed out of the hunt. ``Webasically have done our work,'' Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters. ``Now theSenate has to do its work.''   ``The Senate has to work out its own problems,'' added Rep. BillArcher of Texas, senior Republican on the House Ways and MeansCommittee.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, planned onelast meeting on the issue with senior colleagues, even as theSenate prepared to deliberate the deficit bill.   ``Hope springs eternal,'' Mitchell said, while assailing theBush administration's insistence on the capital-gains reduction.   A series of closed-door leadership meetings in the House andSenate has been aimed at stripping all non-deficit issues from thedeficit-reduction bill. Presumably, the big extraneous issues,including capital gains and the Democrats' proposal to expandtax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts, would be added to anew bill and considered later this year.   Barring a major suprise, the Senate will begin work Thursday onthe bill, a package of spending reductions and tax increases thatwould cut the deficit by about $14 billion this budget year. Thatbill does not include a capital-gains reduction, althoughsupporters may try to have one added during the debate.   Whether to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profitsfrom the sale of investments, has dominated development of thedeficit-reduction bill.   Bush wants a cut, contending it would spur the economy and, atleast in the short run, generate additional revenues for deficitreduction.   Most Democrats oppose the reduction because 80 percent of thetax saving would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.They say the cut would deepen the deficit by $67 billion over thenext 10 years.   Under Senate rules, it would require 60 votes _ rather than theusual majority of 51 _ to add a capital-gains cut to the deficitbill.   Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office ofManagement and Budget, said Thursday night: ``We think we have thevotes to win on this,'' presumably meaning 51. ``Why not have avote?'' he asked in an interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour onPBS.   ``A majority has expressed support for some form ofcapital-gains or another,'' Mitchell said on the same program,``but no majority has agreed to any particular plan ... No plan maypossibly get a majority.''   Mitchell accused the administration of demanding specialtreatment under Senate rules so that a bare majority would be ableto approve a capital-gains cut. He recalled that the minorityRepublicans used the same rule to their benefit earlier this yearand prevailed over Democrats on a bill bailing out the savings andloan industry.   ``The same rules apply to everyone equally,'' Mitchell said.``It is the height of hypocrisy, the height of unfairness to saythey should benefit from the rules when they are advantaged'' andthat Democrats should not when the tables are turned.</TEXT></DOC>
