(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet and American officials watched thedestruction of the first U.S. cruise missile under theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and looked to future armscontrol pacts.   ``The INF treaty is one of the most critical steps in thedirection of ending the Cold War,'' army Major Gen. VladimirMedvedev, head of the Soviet on-site inspection agency, saidthrough an interpreter Tuesday. ``What we saw today was a criticalstep in that direction.   ``I think it's very important for our people to feel moresecure, and I think such acts will make us much closer,'' Medvedevsaid after U.S. military personnel used handheld power saws and anarc torch to slice up the first missile and its protective canister.   U.S. officials hoped to finish destroying 41 cruise missiles and41 canisters, as well as seven mobile launchers, within a few daysat Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.   ``On-site inspections will result in more contacts between thetwo (countries') militaries, more knowledge and hopefully moreunderstanding,'' said Medvedev's U.S. counterpart, Brig. Gen.Roland Lajoie. ``And this, in turn, should generate more confidenceand predictability in our relations.''   Lajoie said there has been far less tension than expected in the115 U.S. inspections of Soviet sites spelled out in the missiletreaty and 31 inspections of U.S. sites by Soviets. He said therehas been ``a lot of flexibility and an amazing amount of good willon both sides.''   Medvedev and 10 other Soviet inspectors watched Tuesday asworkers made two full-length cuts in the first 23-foot aluminumcanister with power saws, then sliced the first missile the sameway with saws and a torch. The missile and the canister split inhalf as they were raised by a forklift.   The workers and inspectors then turned their attention to a56-foot, 78,000-pound mobile launcher.   The missile, a 21-foot weapon built in 1986 by McDonnell-DouglasAstronautics Co., was flight tested at the Army's Dugway ProvingGround in Utah and deployed at an Air Force station in Sicilybefore being shipped to Davis-Monthan in February.   Nuclear warheads have been removed from each of the weaponsslated for destruction, then turned over to the Energy Department,said Capt. Kendell Pease, a spokesman for the Defense Department'sOn-Site Inspection Agency.   Fuel and guidance equipment have also been removed from eachweapon before dismantling, Pease added.   During their stay, the Soviets are being escorted by 22officials from the inspection agency and Davis-Monthan.   Within the first three years of the 13-year treaty, 443 cruisemissiles, most of which were deployed in Great Britain and Europe,are slated for destruction.   The treaty, signed last December by President Reagan and Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev, also calls for elimination of 169shorter-range Pershing I-A and 234 Pershing II missiles deployed inWest Germany.   The pact requires elimination of all land-based nuclear missileswith ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles. Cruise missiles, which cruisesclose to the ground and can be launched from planes, the ground orsubmarines, have a range of about 1,500 miles.   Officials said 58 Pershing missile stages were eliminatedbetween Sept. 8 and Friday at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant inKarnack, Texas. Each Pershing has two stages.   The Army destroyed its first Pershing launcher in West Germanyearlier Tuesday, Lajoie said.   As of Friday, the Soviet Union had eliminated 277 missiles underthe treaty, which calls for the destruction of 1,846 missiles inall.   The INF treaty is the first to allow on-site inspection and isseen as a trial for the proposed Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty.   That pact would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclearweapons by 30 to 50 percent and require more complex procedures forverification.</TEXT></DOC>
