Garcia</HL><DD> 08/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   A late-afternoon buying spree wiped out losses in the stock market and gave share prices a boost.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 11.16 points at 2665.82, after falling nearly 46 points Tuesday.    Stock prices declined through much of yesterday's session, following continued weakness in the dollar and bond prices. Traders said there were sell orders from Japan and Europe early in the day. The industrial average showed a loss of 14.51 points at 3 p.m. EDT.    Several stock and index futures traders said the late-afternoon turnaround appeared to have been started by action in the stock-index futures market after bond futures stopped trading at 3 p.m. As index futures prices moved higher, the stock market followed.    Traders said some of the late buying in the stock market came in the form of programs linked to stock-index futures. As the index futures were pushed up, it became advantageous for some players to sell the index futures, such as the futures on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and buy a basket of the stocks that make up the index.    The broader averages followed the recovery in blue-chip stocks. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.58 to 329.83, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.26 to 184.38.    Volume on the Big Board fell back to 180.9 million shares from 198.4 million shares Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered gainers on the Big Board through much of the session, but the final-hour recovery put more stocks in the plus column. At the closing bell, there were 779 advancing issues and 761 declining.    The last-hour rebound also carried smaller-capitalization stocks higher. The Nasdaq OTC composite index climbed sharply in the final hour, ending up 1.19 to 447.95. Volume fell to 134.1 million shares from 147.5 million Tuesday as 1,185 issues advanced and 1,054 declined.    Phil Roth, a market analyst with E.F. Hutton, said that because the stock market's sell-off Tuesday began with a crack in the dollar, he believes some stability in the U.S. currency is needed before there is another big advance in stock prices.    Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services, said that yesterday's weakness was &quot;in correlation with moves in the currency market. If it had been a fullblown correction, (the declines) would have been much worse.&quot;    One New York-based trader agreed: &quot;It was spooky the small amount of merchandise for sale we saw&quot; even when the market was lower.    Rupert M. Richards, a senior equity trader with the Keystone Group in Boston, said when the dollar levels off, many investors will end up regarding the recent decline as a buying opportunity.    The technology sector was mixed, and the run-up in the final hour pared losses of some issues. International Business Machines eased 1/4 to 172 5/8, Digital Equipment lost 5/8 to 179 1/2, Unisys fell 3/8 to 44 3/4, Microsoft was unchanged at 102 1/2, Compaq Computer added 2 3/8 to 54 1/4 and Apple Computer rose 1 1/4 to 50.    Control Data gained 1 3/4 to 34 3/4. A story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said that some on Wall Street see the Minneapolis-based computer company, on the brink of a bankruptcy-court filing two years ago, as a takeover or turnaround candidate.    Hewlett-Packard sank 2 1/2 to 65. The company reported that earnings for its third quarter ended July 31 rose to 57 cents a share from 48 cents a year earlier. But the results were just on the low end of analysts' expectations.    Newmont Mining slid 1 1/4 to 81 3/4 in active trading. An investor group led by T. Boone Pickens Jr. raised its stake in the mining company to 9.95%. The action negates a standstill agreement between Consolidated Gold Fields and Newmont. But Gold Fields has rejected an offer to meet with Mr. Pickens. Gold Fields is Newmont's largest shareholder, with a 26.2% stake.    Other precious metals stocks were mixed as gold prices eased and silver and platinum prices rose slightly. ASA fell 1/2 to 65 1/2, Phelps Dodge inched up 1/4 to 46 1/4, Reynolds Metals inched up 1/8 to 51 3/8, Echo Bay Mines slipped 1/8 to 25 1/2 and Homestake Mining was unchanged at 43 3/4.    Philadelphia Electric eased 3/8 to 22 5/8 on trading of less than 19.5 million shares. The stock, which begins trading ex-dividend today, yields 9.8%. Traders said the activity was the result of investors trying to capture the dividend payment.    International Minerals andamp; Chemical rose 4 3/8 to 49 3/8. The company plans to buy back as many as nine million shares, or 33% of its common outstanding. It will spin off a substantial portion of its IMC Fertilizer unit.    Citicorp sank 2 1/2 to 63 1/8 on trading of more than 1.4 million shares. Late Tuesday, the bank holding company announced plans for a world-wide offering of 17 million common shares next month. It would be the largest offering in history for a bank.    Analysts said that if the offering is successful, it could draw offerings from other banks that are short on equity capital after they had sharply boosted their loan-loss reserves in the spring. But worries about diluting per-share earnings prompted some investors to unload some of these bank stocks.    Chase Manhattan fell 3/8 to 42 7/8, J.P. Morgan eased 1/4 to 50 5/8, Chemical Bank dropped 1 1/4 to 42 3/4, Wells Fargo eased 1/4 to 58 7/8, BankAmerica lost 1/8 to 12 7/8 and Bankers Trust slid 1 1/4 to 50 1/4.    Monarch Capital closed up 3 1/2 at 78 1/2 after trading as high as 78 7/8 early yesterday. The company told analysts and institutional investors that it expects to double sales of its single-premium variable life insurance product this year.    H.H. Robertson jumped 1 3/4 to 18 5/8. A group including First City Financial of Vancouver, British Columbia, has filed with antitrust regulators for permission to increase its stake in Robertson to 49.9% from the current 24.9%.    Manpower rose 2 1/2 to 78 1/2 on 548,100 shares. Manpower and its British suitor, Blue Arrow, are talking, with a view to finding terms that are acceptable to both of them. Manpower is also talking to other parties. Previously, Manpower rejected a $75-a-share tender offer from Blue Arrow.    Kenner Parker Toys rose 2 1/4 to 49 1/2. New World Entertainment boosted its offer for Kenner Parker to $47 a share from $41 a share. New World Entertainment inched up 1/8 to 10 on the American Stock Exchange. Kenner Parker rejected the previous offer.    Tonka moved up 2 7/8 to 21 1/2. The stock was recommended by Bear Stearns. </TEXT></DOC>
