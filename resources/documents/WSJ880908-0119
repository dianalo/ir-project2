McLean, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1986, reiterated in the statement a plan proposed in July that calls for holders of about $243.5 million in subordinated debt to receive about $2.8 million in secured notes, $360,000 in preferred stock plus about 11% of the reorganized company's stock. Current holders of McLean stock and warrants don't receive anything under the plan.    McLean said most of the loss is attributable to a $50.9 million write-down of McLean's investment in Purcell Co. It added that as of Dec. 31, 1987, its common stockholders' deficit was $231.2 million.    The statement, which also covers three subsidiaries, was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.    McLean said it expects the disclosure statement to be approved by Oct. 31. The company plans to emerge from its reorganization with its shipping operations liquidated, and concentrate on real estate operations.    Under Chapter 11, a company is shielded from creditor lawsuits as it devises a debt-payment plan. </TEXT></DOC>
