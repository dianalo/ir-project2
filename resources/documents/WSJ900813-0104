What else is one to make ofthe phantasmagoria of images and religious incantations thathe released in a statement Friday? &quot;O Arabs, O Moslems, Obelievers in God wherever you are. This is your day to riseand spread quickly in order to defend Mecca, which is captiveof the spears of the Americans and the Zionist,&quot; said Saddam,who seems to have undergone a conversion on the road toRiyadh.
