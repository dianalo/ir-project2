The maker of electronic telephone systems said the sale was made to the London brokerage concern Kleinwort Benson Ltd. Kleinwort Benson, in turn, immediately sold V Band PLC to London-based Telephone Rentals PLC. V Band said the three-way transaction will allow it more favorable tax treatment than it would have received if it had sold the unit directly to Telephone Rentals. Telephone Rentals sells, leases, installs and maintains telecommunications equipment.    Because of the sale, V Band will post a one-time gain of about $11.2 million, or $1.60 a share, for the year ending Oct. 31. In 1986, it earned $5.2 million, or 80 cents a share, on revenue of $36.8 million.    The company said it entered a long-term distribution accord with V Band PLC, which will be renamed TR Financial Communications PLC. Under the pact, Telephone Rentals will market, install and maintain V Band products in the United Kingdom and Ireland.    V Band said proceeds from the sale will be used to expand its market and to develop product lines. </TEXT></DOC>
