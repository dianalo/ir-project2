Now the 80-year-old store is trying to make its ownmiraculous comeback. And leading the way is none other thanA. Alfred Taubman, a retailing wizard who plastered thecountryside with sprawling malls that helped destroy downtownstores like John Wanamaker. Once the city's dominant retailstore, Wanamaker deteriorated so precipitously in the 1980sthat its granite 12-story building was sold a few years ago,and the store itself whittled down to five floors.</LP><TEXT>   Yet Mr. Taubman and his team of retailing experts seegreat entertainment potential for the downtown store: afive-story stage, if you will, with credit-card-carryingcustomers as its audience. Come downtown, and watchprofessional chefs cook homemade pizza. Come and listen toorgan recitals. The team wants to do for downtown stores whatRingling did for the circus.   &quot;The store is a theater,&quot; says Arnold Aronson, a formerchairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, whom Mr. Taubman picked toresuscitate Wanamaker. Downtown stores are bigger and havemore character, Mr. Aronson says. &quot;The presentation is moredramatic. . . . It has room for restaurants and parking, anda show-biz atmosphere.&quot;   And so while others give up on downtown stores, Mr.Taubman is spending $50 million to make his a showpiece.   Skeptics, though, warn that lavish sequels often fallflat. &quot;They're living off the customer who is 50 and over,and while she waxes enthusiastic about the store, she doesn'topen her pocketbook,&quot; says Alan Millstein, publisher of theFashion Network Report. That kind of customer has alreadyabandoned dozens of other now-shuttered downtown stores,including New York's B. Altman, Washington's Garfinckel's,and now Rich's downtown store in Atlanta -- closed last monthin spite of a $9 million facelift six years ago.   &quot;I don't think he can make it work,&quot; says Richard Posner,an executive of Credit Exchange Inc., which providesfinancial information to the apparel industry. He notes thatdepartment stores have to fight not only strong specialtystores like the Gap, but also the increasingly populardiscount chains.   This year, discounters' revenues will exceed the combinedsales of local and national department stores for the firsttime, Commerce Department data indicate. &quot;Shoppers know whichbrand they want before they walk into the store, and whatthey are looking for is the lowest possible price,&quot; saysRobert Kahn, a retail consultant and a director of discounterWal-Mart Stores Inc.   Mr. Taubman bought the John Wanamaker business in 1986from Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. to complement hisWashington-area chain of 17 Woodward andamp; Lothrop departmentstores. He believed the two chains, operating withinprivately held Woodward andamp; Lothrop Inc. (of which he owns84%), could dominate the affluent Washington/Philadelphiacorridor and generate $1 billion in annual revenue.   Then the stock market crashed and consumers began turningcautious. Mr. Taubman tried to sell the stores in 1988, butprospective buyers couldn't get financing. Sales at Woodwardandamp; Lothrop Inc. slipped to $873 million in 1990, a four-yearlow.   And there are other problems. The retail company hasn'tbeen able to meet its interest payments out of operationsand, to pay them, has had to borrow from its working-capitalcredit line.   The billionaire Mr. Taubman remains undaunted. He declinesto be interviewed, but writes in a letter that &quot;I feel thedepartment store, contrary to short-sighted predictions, willcontinue to be a dominant retailing format in America intothe 21st century,&quot; and &quot;offer shoppers unparalleledconvenience, service and merchandise selection.&quot;   That's a pretty strong statement for a man who made hisfortune making downtown stores obsolete, and whose companyowns 22 shopping malls in all. But the 66-year-old executive,who is also chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., has a knackfor breathing new life into old institutions. His formula:cash, attention to detail and an army of hand-picked experts.   When he became chairman of the venerable but ailingSotheby's auction house in the early 1980s, art loversblanched at the thought of a man who had built Kmarts tryingto sell Monets. The response from Mr. Taubman, who also ownsa chain of Aandamp;W Restaurants, was that selling art was likeselling root beer: People just want a happy experience.   Department stores, if nothing else, can provide that -- aone-of-a-kind experience, in fact. How many boxy suburbanstores offer Roman arches, white-marble columns and theoccasional white-gloved doorman? John Wanamaker downtowndoes, along with the world's largest functioning pipe organ,played twice a day by a full-time organist.   During the Christmas season, there's an hourly LasVegas-like light show, five stories high and accompanied by afountain that sends streams of water dancing in the air.Generations of Philadelphians have brought their children towatch.   The store, whose namesake founder started with a smallmen's shop on the site of one of George Washington's homes,doesn't want to lose that nostalgic good feeling. But itdoesn't want to seem old-fashioned, either. The challenge isto keep one foot tapping to Muzak and the other to MTV.   It's not an impossible task. In the early 1970s the giantR.H. Macy store in New York appeared doomed; since then,sales at that store have nearly tripled. But Macy's also hadthe benefit of a bustling midtown Manhattan. DowntownPhiladelphia is struggling.   The city lost 6% of its population between 1980 and 1990,and longtime residents say they are increasingly afraid ofcrime downtown. But there are positive signs, too: A downtownconvention center and a 1,200-room hotel are scheduled toopen in a few years, both within walking distance of JohnWanamaker's. And if the now-vacant office space above theretailer is fully rented, 3,500 employees will be only anelevator ride away. &quot;The key is Mr. Taubman,&quot; says PeterWarlick, a Salomon Brothers analyst. &quot;So far, he has been apatient, supportive investor.&quot;   He also has kept his hands off operations, somewhatuncharacteristically for an executive who once instructed oneof his tenants where to display goods. Instead, he hasrelinquished operations to Mr. Aronson, a 56-year-old NewEnglander who attended Harvard and made his name rejuvenatingSaks.   The two met when Mr. Aronson tried to buy Woodward andamp;Lothrop Inc. from Mr. Taubman. Though he didn't get it, hemade such an impression that Mr. Taubman offered him equityin the company, hiring him as chairman and chief executive inFebruary 1989. They meet only twice a year to talk strategy.   &quot;What we're doing at John Wanamaker is addressing 10 yearsof neglect,&quot; says Mr. Aronson. The old brown and graycarpeting has been torn out and replaced by pink and graymarble, teak wood, and enough new carpet to cover 10 footballfields. There are 15,000 new light fixtures and enough newpaint to cover the Brooklyn Bridge, twice.   Gone is the grandfather clock department and apothecarythat dispensed prescription drugs; the store restaurant nowserves sauteed crab and steak tartare, not whipped potatoesand meat loaf. And John Wanamaker no longer operates its bigbudget department on the lower level. &quot;People used to saythat if you couldn't find it in Wanamaker's, you couldn'tfind it anyplace, but that's not true anymore,&quot; sighs oneemployee. &quot;They've given up televisions and stereos, the petshop, even fabrics.&quot;   Instead, customers find racks of Donna Karan'sbody-hugging looks, and elegant but somber women's outfitsfrom Giorgio Armani. An 11,000-square-foot Liz Claibornedepartment for women is one of the largest in the country.   Shopper David Binswanger, a real estate executive, isimpressed with the renovations. &quot;I think it will take alittle time, but I do think Philadelphians will end up comingback to the store,&quot; he says.   Mr. Aronson expects more-expensive merchandise to generatehigher profit margins. That would help offset the store'slower revenue, which has fallen in two years to $65 millionfrom $100 million, largely because of the construction goingon and the elimination of low-margin budget products.   Mr. Aronson is also banking on a national stay-at-hometrend to boost sales, as it has done in the home-furnishingsdepartments at rival Federated and Allied stores. At thedowntown Wanamaker store, for example, customers can buyOriental rugs, framed reproductions of famous paintings andeven an $18,000 reproduction of an l8th-century Americansecretary.   Mr. Aronson is essentially using the same formula he usedat Saks, but with an awareness of Wanamaker's broader classof customers. After Saks lost some cachet in the mid-1970s byoffering lower-priced goods, Mr. Aronson rebuilt itscarriage-trade image by broadening expensive designer linesand a personal shopping service.   &quot;We hope to use some of the same merchandising techniquesto turn around Wanamaker,&quot; he says. &quot;Downtown stores stillcan represent an unparalleled headquarters for the widestassortment of merchandise customers can experience in onevisit.&quot;   Richard Freundlich, chairman of Nan Duskin Inc., a women'sspecialty chain that considers itself the Bergdorf Goodman ofPhiladelphia, says the formula may work. &quot;If they can hit theright merchandise niches, the store can come back as thegrand bastion of retailing,&quot; he says. &quot;But whether it canrise to its old heights, I just don't know.&quot;   The current retail climate is dismal. John Wanamaker isalso locked in competition with archrival Strawbridge andamp;Clothier, a nearby moderate-priced department store retailer.In April, one day before John Wanamaker launched its annualanniversary sale, Strawbridge bought 13 ad pages in thePhiladelphia Inquirer to promote a &quot;One Day Wonder Sale&quot; withhundreds of brand-name products. John Wanamaker didn't buyany ads that day, preferring the traditional method ofstarting a sale: a private mailing to charge customers.   Still, the mood at John Wanamaker remains decidedlyupbeat. &quot;It used to be pretty depressing working here,&quot; saysFrank McLaughlin, a Wanamaker branch manager in Reading, Pa.,who has worked 22 years for the chain. &quot;Now we see moneybeing spent. Everybody feels better.&quot; Besides the $50 millionhe's pouring into the downtown store, Mr. Taubman is spending$45 million to $50 million to renovate the 14 outlyingWanamaker branches. This includes a new $25 million JohnWanamaker store that will open today in Newark, Del. -- thechain's first new store in 12 years.   And though retail revenues in July were weak through muchof the country, sales at Woodward andamp; Lothrop Inc. stores opena year or more were up about 5%. &quot;July was our best month ofthe year,&quot; says Mr. Aronson. &quot;Now we're starting to lookrespectable.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
