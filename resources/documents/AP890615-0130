The decisions were denounced by civil rights advocates, who saidcourt rulings in recent months had dealt a significant setback tocivil rights law.   The justices unanimously reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted tohelp freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused ofrace bias.   But the court, by a separate 5-4 vote, also ruled that the123-year-old civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racialharassment.   Civil rights groups found little solace in the fact that a biggerdefeat was avoided. They said the decision on racial harassment isfurther evidence a newly solidified conservative majority is intenton rolling back years of progress for minorities and women.   ``This Supreme Court term has been a disaster for all thosecommitted to equal employment opportunity,'' said Benjamin Hooks andRalph Neas of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.   Speaking of a string of recent Supreme Court decisions, Sen.Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said ``the end-of-term decisions by theSupreme Court on civil rights are a growing cause of concern toCongress and all Americans who care about equal opportunity in oursociety and equal justice under law.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in his opinion for the court, saidadherence to precedent compelled the conservative majority on thecourt to uphold the 1976 ruling.   Furthermore, he said, even if that ruling was based on a mistakeninterpretation of law, ``it is certain that it is not inconsistentwith the prevailing sense of justice in this country. To thecontrary, (it) is entirely consistent with our society's deepcommitment to the eradication of discrimination based on a person'srace or the color of his or her skin.''   But Justice Kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment wasnot envisioned by the 1866 law.   He said the law governs contractual rights _ not most conduct byan employer after an individual is hired.   The 1866 law ``covers only conduct at the initial formation ofthe contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce contractobligations through legal process,'' Justice Kennedy said.   In another decision, the court gave states and state officialssweeping new protection from federal lawsuits accusing them of civilrights violations.   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they maynot be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.   Justice William J. Brennan, in an opinion dissenting from thecourt's decision on racial harassment, said, ``What the courtdeclines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the other.''   Brennan said the court ``has to strain hard'' to interpret the1866 law in a way that ignores ``powerful historic evidence aboutthe Reconstruction Congress' concerns'' to end race bias.   Joining Brennan in partial dissent were Justices ThurgoodMarshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.   The five-member conservative majority that voted against applyingthe anti-discrimination law to harassment cases consisted ofKennedy, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra DayO'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron R. White.   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are appointees of former PresidentRonald Reagan and Rehnquist was promoted to chief justice by Reagan.   The court sent shock waves through the civil rights community inApril 1988 when it announced it would use a relatively obscure casefrom North Carolina to reconsider its 1976 ruling.   While no party to the North Carolina case urged the court toreconsider the 1976 precedent, the justices by a 5-4 vote took theextraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for are-examination.   The four dissenters then said that the move threatened toundermine the faith minorities have placed in the high court.   The 1976 decision, called Runyon vs. McCrary, held that raciallysegregated private schools which refused to admit blacks violate theCivil Rights Act of 1866.   That law was intended to ensure recently freed slaves all therights of citizenship.   The 1976 ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law asa weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms.   For example, no other federal law bars racially segregatedprivate schools. Also, the law provides for heavy punitive damagesagainst those found to have practiced discrimination.   That is of particular importance in job bias cases which accountfor some three-fourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law.Congress in 1964 outlawed on-the-job discrimination, but did notprovide for such heavy penalties.   The 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challeging bias inthe sale of private homes.   The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of U.S.senators, more than 100 House members and more than 100 civil rightsand public interest groups urged the court not to tamper with its1976 ruling.   The North Carolina case stemmed from an appeal by BrendaPatterson, a black woman who was a teller at McLean Credit Union.She sued under the 1866 law, seeking actual and punitive damages foralleged harassment.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling bya federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., throwing out her suit.   The Supreme Court today agreed with the appeals court and refusedto revive Ms. Patterson's suit.   In other action, the court:   _ Gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he fathered thechild of a woman married to someone else.   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.   _ Shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seekingto enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education forhandicapped children.   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials frompaying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learningdisability.   The case involving the 1866 civil rights law is Patterson vs.McLean Credit Union, 87-107.</TEXT></DOC>
