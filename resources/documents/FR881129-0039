Introduction</ITAG>Today's proposed rule would amend the National Oil and Hazardous SubstancesPollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, by adding a newandSection; 300.440.The purpose of this off-site regulation is to avoid having wastes fromCERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions contribute to present orfuture environmental problems by directing these wastes to management unitsdetermined to be environmentally sound. Congress and EPA have always believedthat a CERCLA cleanup should be more than a relocation of environmentalproblems, and have attempted to ensure the proper treatment and disposalof hazardous substances removed from a CERCLA site.Today's proposed rule implements the requirements of section 121(d)(3)of CERCLA, which provides that in the case of any CERCLA response actioninvolving the transfer of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminantoff-site, that waste may only be placed in a facility that is in compliancewith RCRA (or other Federal law) and applicable State requirements. CERCLArequires that for ``land disposal facilities,'' there may be no transferof wastes to a unit with releases, and any releases at other units mustbe controlled. These statutory requirements apply only to CERCLA cleanupactions originating after the date of enactment of SARA.These requirements are integral components of the ``selection of remedialaction'' provision in CERCLA section 121, and their proper applicationis necessary to ensure that response actions selected are protective ofhuman health and the environment (consistent with CERCLA section 121(b)(1),and more generally, with section 104(a)(1)).Although CERCLA section 121(d)(3) applies compliance criteria to all facilities,it applies ``release'' criteria only to land disposal facilities. EPA believes,as a matter of policy, that some release criteria should also be appliedto all facilities that receive wastes from CERCLA-authorized or -fundedresponse actions, including RCRA treatment, storage, and permit-by-rulefacilities, and any non-RCRA Subtitle C facilities (such as facilitiespermitted to receive wastes under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)).The Agency believes that such a step will further the protection of humanhealth and the environment, and the development of a sound and consistentpublic policy; it would also serve to further the goals reflected in CERCLAsection 121(d)(3).Similarly, although section 121(d)(3) applies to wastes from post-SARAcleanup actions only, EPA believes that it is logical and appropriate toapply compliance and release criteria to wastes resulting from two additionalcategories of similar cleanup actions: those authorized under CERCLA beforethe enactment of SARA, and those performed under the National ContingencyPlan pursuant to section 311 of the Clean Water Act (for non-petroleumproducts). Accordingly, this proposed rule applies to a number of situationsin addition to those expressly set out in section 121(d)(3) of CERCLA.The revised off-site policy of November 13, 1987 (OSWER Directive andplusmin;9834.11),will remain in effect during the pendency of this proposal, but it willbe superseded by the off-site rule when finally issued.Today's proposed rule establishes the criteria and procedures for determiningwhether facilities are acceptable for the off-site receipt of waste fromCERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions and outlines the wastes andactions affected by the criteria. It establishes compliance criteria andrelease criteria and discusses the differences in applicability of thesecriteria to facilities receiving wastes from pre-SARA or post-SARA actions.The proposed rule also establishes a process for determining whether facilitiesare acceptable based on the compliance and release criteria.The proposed rule establishes procedures for notification of unacceptability,appeals of unacceptability determinations, and re-evaluation of unacceptabilitydeterminations. Under the rule, the policy of applying off-site requirementsto actions taken under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, asamended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (RCRA) would be stopped.The off-site regulation should help prevent the aggravation of conditionsat problem sites and reduce the Government's and the Superfund's potentialliability by establishing criteria governing the off-site transfer of wastefrom CERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions. The rule should alsohelp to ensure that off-site transfer decisions are made in an environmentallysensible manner, consistent with sound public policy and business practices.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Background</ITAG>From the beginning of the CERCLA program, Congress has mandated that Superfundwastes be treated, stored, and disposed of in an environmentally soundmanner. Section 104(c)(3) of the original Superfund legislation (CERCLA,December 1980) required States to ensure the availability of a hazardouswaste disposal facility in compliance with RCRA Subtitle C for receiptof waste from Fund-financed remedial actions.In January 1983, EPA issued ``Guidance on the Requirements for Selectingan Off-Site Option in a Superfund Response Action''. This first guidanceon the off-site transfer of CERCLA wastes required that a facility be inspectedand that all major violations at the facility be corrected in order forthe facility to be acceptable for the receipt of CERCLA wastes from remedialor removal actions. EPA's May 1985 ``Procedures for Planning and Implementing Off-Site ResponseActions'' (50 FR 45933) (``off-site policy'') detailed the criteria forevaluating the acceptability of facilities to receive Superfund wastes.These criteria required that the facility have a RCRA permit or RCRA interimstatus, as well as receive a compliance inspection not more than six monthsprior to receiving CERCLA waste. The policy also required significant violationsor other environmental conditions to be addressed through appropriate enforcementactions. The off-site policy further required that land disposal unitsaccepting CERCLA waste be in compliance with the minimum technology requirementsof RCRA section 3004(o). The policy finally required that all RCRA manifestrequirements and PCB disposal requirements must be followed when applicable.In addition to detailing these evaluation criteria, the off-site policyalso extended coverage under the policy to include enforcement actionsunder CERCLA section 106 and RCRA section 7003 as well as Superfund removalactions.The National Contingency Plan (NCP), revised in November 1985 (40 CFR Part300), incorporated requirements for off-site receipt of CERCLA waste. TheNCP, at 40 CFR 300.68(a)(3), required that facilities have permits, orother appropriate authorization to operate, in order to be acceptable forreceiving off-site CERCLA waste.The 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) reaffirmedthe rationale embodied in CERCLA section 104(c)(3) and the May 1985 off-sitepolicy. Section 121(d)(3) of CERCLA, as added by SARA, explicitly providesthat in the case of any CERCLA ``removal or remedial action involving thetransfer of any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant off-site,''such transfer shall only be to a facility operating in compliance withthe Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by RCRA and the Hazardous andSolid Waste Amendments (HSWA)), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),or other Federal law, and all applicable State requirements. The sectionalso requires that receiving units at land disposal facilities have noreleases of hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents and that any releasesfrom other units at a land disposal facility be controlled by a RCRA correctiveaction program.Finally, EPA issued revised procedures for implementing off-site responseactions on November 13, 1987, as a memorandum from J. Winston Porter, AssistantAdministrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response, to the EPA RegionalAdministrators (OSWER Directive No. 9834.11) (the ``revised off-site policy'').These procedures, which were effective immediately, implemented the SARArequirements, updated the 1985 off-site policy, and provided detailed proceduresfor issuing and reviewing unacceptability determinations.The requirements set out in CERCLA section 121(d)(3) (and incorporatedin the November 1987 revised off-site policy) prescribe a higher standardof care for the management of hazardous substances from CERCLA-funded or-authorized cleanups than for the management of waste from other sources.First, section 121(d)(3) directs EPA to send wastes from CERCLA cleanupsonly to those facilities operating ``in compliance'' with RCRA and otherapplicable laws, whereas private generators may send wastes to facilitiesthat have some regulatory violations (unless the violations are so seriousthat the facility is stopped from operating). Second, by prohibiting disposalin units at a land disposal facility with releases (a release itself isgenerally not a violation of RCRA), SARA went beyond requirements applicableto commercial generators and beyond the May 1985 policy, which requiredcompliance with RCRA and other applicable laws but allowed the Agency tocontinue to send CERCLA wastes to a facility with releases if the Agencyjudged that the releases did not constitute environmental conditions thataffected the satisfactory operation of the facility.Congressional intent to establish more stringent requirements for CERCLAwastes is seen in a 1985 report of the House Committee on Energy and Commerceon a predecessor bill to SARA:<ITAG tagnum="21">The transfer of wastes removed from Superfund sites to operating landfillswhich are also leaking toxics into the environment is a problem that continuesto plague the Superfund program * * * In an effort to address this seriousproblem, the bill would prohibit the transfer of Superfund wastes to RCRAfacilities which are not operating in compliance with the requirementsof sections 3004 and 3005 of that Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unfortunately, this relatively simple legal prohibition does not resolvethe problem of transferring Superfund wastes to leaking landfills becausethe RCRA program involves a two-stage process for the regulation and permittingof operating hazardous waste disposal facilities. First, the owners andoperators of such facilities were granted ``interim status'' under thelaw without demonstrating that they have effectively prevented any leakage,or contamination, of the environment. Only in the second stage of the program_whichEPA does not intend to fully implement until the end of the decade_willthe owners and operators of such facilities be given final permits thatrequire them to guarantee that their facilities are not leaking toxic substancesinto groundwater, surface water, soil or air.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because it is not a violation of RCRA Interim status requirementsto operate with significant leakage problems, many facilities are experiencingsuch problems. The bill prohibits the transfer of Superfund wastes to facilitieswhich are already releasing hazardous wastes into groundwater. [H. Rept.253, 99th Cong., 1st sess. at 279 (1985).]</ITAG>Today's proposed rule implements and codifies the requirements containedin CERCLA section 121(d)(3), as well as those in the revised off-site policymemorandum.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Scope and Applicability</ITAG>A. Wastes AffectedThis proposed rule applies to the off-site treatment, storage or disposalof all waste from CERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions. Cerclawastes include RCRA hazardous wastes and all other CERCLA hazardous substances,pollutants and contaminants. RCRA hazardous wastes are either listed ordefined by their characteristics at 40 CFR Part 261; CERCLA hazardous substancesare defined in section 101(14) of CERCLA and at 40 CFR 300.6; and CERCLApollutants and contaminants are defined in section 101(33) of CERCLA andat 40 CFR 300.6.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Samples</ITAG>The transfer of samples to an off-site laboratory for characterizationis not subject to this rule. However, the subsequent transfer of the wastesamples is subject to the requirements of this rule. EPA believes thatthis limited exemption is appropriate because: in general, the samplesused for characterization are small; laboratories are intended for analysis,not for treatment, storage or disposal; rapid sample characterization iscritical to prompt site evaluation and response; and the ultimate treatment,storage or disposal of the waste samples will occur at facilities determinedto be acceptable under this rule.B. Actions AffectedEPA interprets CERCLA section 121(d)(3) as expressing Congress' intentthat wastes cleaned up pursuant to the response authorities of CERCLA (orwith financing from CERCLA's ``Superfund'') should be sent only to themost environmentally sound facilities in order to guarantee that the responseactions chosen are fully protective of human health and the environmentand do not create new environmental problems. EPA believes these goalsare also important for CERCLA response actions outside the scope of section121(d)(3); thus the proposed rule would apply to all removal or remedialactions involving the off-site transfer of any hazardous substance, pollutantor contaminant that were financed in whole or in part by CERCLA's Superfundor were taken pursuant to CERCLA response authorities (whether initiatedbefore or after the enactment of SARA), including those actions taken jointlyunder CERCLA and another authority. The rule does apply to cleanups atFederal facilities under section 120 of CERCLA. In addition, as a matterof policy, the proposed rule would apply to those removal or remedial actionsinvolving the off-site transfer of CERCLA hazardous substances pursuantto section 311 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321). The extension ofthis rule to CWA actions is consistent with the NCP (<T3>see </T3>40 CFR 300.4) and with EPA's responsibility to ensure thatits response actions (including the choice of an off-site treatment, storageor disposal facility) are protective of health and the environment (CERCLAsection 104(a)(1)). CWA response actions are like any other removal orremedial action covered by this rule, and wastes from such actions (exceptoil) will be subject to the requirements of this rule in the same manneras any CERCLA waste, including the differing requirements for wastes frompre- and post-SARA decision documents.The proposed rule would not apply to State-lead enforcement actions (evenat National Priorities List (NPL) sites) if no CERCLA funds or authoritiesare involved. The proposed rule does apply to State-lead enforcement actionswhere EPA provides any site-specific funding through a Cooperative Agreementor Multi-Site Cooperative Agreement, even though the State may be usingits own enforcement authorities to compel the cleanup. Similarly, non-NPLsites are covered by this proposed rule where there is an expenditure ofCERCLA money or where the cleanup is undertaken under CERCLA authority.In cases of removal actions under CERCLA, enforcement actions taken asremoval actions, or response actions under section 311 of the Clean WaterAct, where allowing the source of a release or threat of a release to remainin an area of public access will result in an immediate and significantthreat, the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) may determine that it is imperativeto remove the substances immediately and that there is insufficient timeto observe these procedures without endangering public health, welfareor the environment. In such cases, the OSC may consider temporary measures(e.g., interim storage) to allow time to locate an acceptable facility.Where these attempts fail, the OSC should choose the action that best protectshuman health and the environment. This exemption for emergency removalactions was expressly discussed in the Conference Report on SARA (H. Rept.962, 99th Cong., 2d sess. at 248 (1986)).C. Pre-SARA vs. Post-SARA ActionsPrior to the enactment of SARA, EPA considered a number of factors concerningthe condition and operation of off-site facilities before sending wastesfrom CERCLA-funded or -authorized cleanups to such sites; these factorswere set out in the May 1985 off-site policy. In passing SARA in 1986,Congress reaffirmed the rationale of this policy by establishing specificcriteria (CERCLA section 121(d)(3)) for certain off-site transfers of CERCLAcleanup wastes. However, it specified in section 121(b)(1) of SARA thatthe new criteria would apply only to response actions initiated <T3>after </T3>the date of enactment of SARA, leaving in place the May1985 criteria for wastes from pre-SARA actions. Although section 121(d)(3)does impose criteria on future cleanup actions that are stricter than thosepreviously imposed, the failure to apply such criteria to pre-SARA actionsindicates a judgement that the prior off-site criteria provided an adequatelevel of protection of health and the environment, and that applying anew set of acceptability criteria to facilities already receiving CERCLAcleanup wastes would disrupt and delay on-going cleanup activities. Thusthe proposed rule covers two classes of actions: those based on ``pre-SARA''decision documents and those based on ``post-SARA'' decision documents.As already mentioned, each class is subject to slightly different proceduresfor off-site transfer.Post-SARA actions result from CERCLA decision documents signed or consentdecrees lodged after October 17, 1986 (post-SARA decision documents), andare subject to the requirements of SARA as interpreted by this rule.\1\<NOTE/> Facilities receiving wastes from post-SARA actions must meetthe compliance criteria described in section V.A.1. as well as the releasecriteria outlined in V.A.2.b.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In order not to delay ongoing actions or disrupt actionstaken shortly after the enactment of SARA, Congress provided, in section121(b)(2) of SARA, that actions resulting from decision documents signedor consent decrees lodged within the 30-day period following SARA enactmentwere merely required to comply with the post-SARA criteria in section 121(d)(3)of CERCLA ``to the maximum extent practicable.'' This level of compliancemust be certified in writing by the Administrator in the decision documentor consent decree.Pre-SARA actions result from CERCLA decision documents signed or consentdecrees lodged prior to October 17, 1986 (pre-SARA decision documents).These actions were subject to the May 1985 and November 1987 policies whichwill be superseded by this rule. Facilities receiving wastes from pre-SARAactions must meet the compliance criteria described in section V.A.1. ofthis preamble, but are subject to different release criteria than facilitiesreceiving post-SARA wastes as described in section V.A.2.c.D. <T3>RCRA Section 7003 Actions </T3>The May 1985 off-site policy applied to actions taken under RCRA section7003 and the revised policy issued November 13, 1987, continued to applythe off-site requirements to section 7003 actions. However, CERCLA doesnot require extension of the rule to these actions. After reviewing theimplications of continuing to apply the off-site requirements to section7003 actions, EPA plans to drop the requirement that the off-site criteriaapply to actions taken under section 7003 for the following reasons. Theoriginal policy included wastes from section 7003 actions because at thattime most section 7003 actions were taken jointly with actions under aCERCLA authority (e.g., CERCLA 106/RCRA 7003 actions) and it was appropriateto extend the policy to section 7003 actions which were essentially CERCLAactions. Use of joint RCRA/CERCLA actions involving section 7003 are nolonger a common practice. Rather, EPA plans to use the section 7003 authorityto promote voluntary cleanup and corrective action at sites which do notqualify for the NPL, and at facilities with RCRA permits where a majorpermit modification would otherwise be required. The Agency is concernedthat imposing the off-site requirements on actions taken under section7003 may act as a disincentive to parties considering voluntary cleanupsunder this authority. E. <T3>States' Role </T3>EPA is proposing that determinations of acceptability to receive an off-sitetransfer of CERCLA cleanup wastes be made by EPA or by the relevant State,if that State has demonstrated to EPA the capacity to make such determinations.CERCLA section 104(d)(1)(A) provides as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">A State or political subdivision thereof or Indian tribe may applyto the President to carry out actions authorized in this section. If thePresident determines that the State * * * has the capability to carry outany or all of such actions in accordance with the criteria and prioritiesestablished pursuant to section 105(a)(8) and to carry out related enforcementactions, the President may enter into a contract or cooperative agreementwith the State * * * to carry out such actions.</ITAG>This provision provides a mechanism by which States that demonstrate adequatecapability may carry out response actions authorized under CERCLA section104. Section 104 actions include ``arrang[ing] for'' removal or remedialaction (<T3>see</T3> CERCLA section 104(a)(1)), which may include the off-sitedetermination function. In addition, the Agency believes that the determinationof whether sites are acceptable to receive wastes from CERCLA funded orauthorized response actions is an integral component of the selection ofremedy decision, and therefore, is an integral part of the response action.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ CERCLA section 104(c)(4) specifically requires that section104 remedial actions be carried out in accordance with section 121 of theAct. EPA believes that allowing qualifying States to make the off-site determinationsmakes sense as a matter of policy. States often have the most direct knowledgeand responsibility over the potential receiving facilities within theirrespective jurisdictions, and thus may be in the best position to makethe findings required under the off-site rule. In addition, no CERCLA remedial actions may be provided by the Presidentunder section 104 if a State does not, pursuant to section 104(c)(3)(B),``assure the availability of a hazardous waste disposal facility acceptableto the President and in compliance with the requirements of Subtitle Cof the Solid Waste Disposal Act [RCRA] for any necessary off-site storage,destruction, treatment, or secure disposition of the hazardous substances.''Thus, allowing States to make off-site acceptability determinations withintheir jurisdictions would directly support the State's site-specific responseprogram. Further, in the context of providing the assurance required insection 104(c)(3)(B), States would tend to have already made many of thefindings necessary to support off-site determinations. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Demonstration of State Capability </ITAG>For the purposes of this rule, it is EPA's opinion that a State that hasbeen authorized to carry out the base program under RCRA and to imposecorrective action under section 3004(u) of RCRA (hereinafter an ``authorizedState''), has the capability to make off-site determinations at RCRA facilitieswithin that State. (Determinations involving non-RCRA facilities wouldcontinue to be made by EPA.) Having the authority to initiate correctiveaction under section 3004(u) of RCRA is of special importance, becausethe decision of whether to send CERCLA cleanup waste to a RCRA facilityis heavily dependent upon whether releases at the facility are being controlledby a RCRA corrective action program. (See, e.g., CERCLA section 121(d)(3)(B),relating to RCRA land disposal facilities.) The Agency requests comment on whether EPA should also require States tobe authorized for the implementation of the land disposal restrictionsportion of RCRA (section 3004 (d), (e), (g), and (j)), or other parts ofthe Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) that amended RCRA,in order to demonstrate their capacity to make off-site acceptability determinations.Under this proposal, a State may qualify to make off-site acceptabilitydeterminations only with respect to facilities within the State (to whichthe RCRA corrective action authorities apply). Those determinations wouldapply with equal force to wastes from out-of-State response actions. Theacceptability determination made under the off-site rule is in no way affectedby the State of origin of the waste. Similarly, off-site acceptabilitydeterminations made by qualifying States will have effect whether the specificresponse actions generating the waste was taken under the authority ofsections 104, 106 or 120 of CERCLA, section 311 of CWA, or taken pursuantto some other authority financed in whole or in part by CERCLA's Superfund.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Cooperative Agreement Requirement</ITAG>States need not adopt regulations that are equivalent to those in thisproposed rule in order to qualify to make off-site determinations. However,they may make such determinations only pursuant to a cooperative agreementunder section 104(d)(1)(A), in which the State commits (1) to follow theoff-site rule's requirements in making determinations of acceptability,and (2) to consult with EPA in order to ensure that determinations aremade in a consistent manner nationwide.Off-site determination tasks will generally be included in Core ProgramCooperative Agreements (``CPCAs''). CPCAs are specifically designed toprovide States with the opportunity to participate fully in EPA's effortsto implement CERCLA, and to assist States in the effective implementationof their CERCLA programs. In the Conference Report on SARA, the discussionof amendments to section 104(d) reflects Congressional intent to increasethe scope of Cooperative Agreements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Included within the class of activities that may be the subject ofCooperative Agreements are those associated with the overall implementation,coordination, enforcement * * * and administration of remedial effortsas authorized by this Act. [H. Rept. 962, 99th Cong., 2d sess. at 195 (1986).]</ITAG>States that have authorization for the RCRA base program only would notbe able to make off-site determinations on their own. However, they couldmake findings as to the compliance status of RCRA facilities (the relevantEPA Region would make findings regarding any releases at the facilities).EPA would then make the final determination based on all available information,and would be the agency responsible for that determination. No cooperativeagreement would be required under these circumstances.The Agency also considered the approach of having the EPA Regional Officesmake all off-site acceptability determinations. This approach would havethe advantages of more easily assuring consistent application of the rule,and avoiding conflicts between the Region and the State regarding the acceptabilitystatus of a facility. The Agency decided against proposing this alternativebecause the States are often more familiar with facilities within theirState than is the Region. (States generally maintain a strong oversightpresence at their larger facilities through frequent inspections and sitevisits.) In addition, allowing States to make this decision is consistentwith EPA's overall goal of having States implement the hazardous wasteprogram.The Agency specifically requests comment on whether qualifying States shouldmake off-site acceptability determinations as proposed, or whether EPAshould exercise that decision-making authority through its Regional Offices.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Determining Acceptability</ITAG>A. Acceptability CriteriaThe following criteria will be used to determine the acceptability of facilitiesto receive wastes from CERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Compliance Criteria</ITAG>a. <T3>Receiving Unit.</T3> The Agency is defining a receiving unit to beany unit that directly receives CERCLA off-site waste: (1) For treatmentto standards specified in 40 CFR Part 268, Subpart D, including any pre-treatmentor storage units used prior to treatment; (2) for treatment to reduce substantiallyits mobility, toxicity or persistence in the absence of a defined treatmentstandard, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment;or (3) for storage or ultimate disposal of waste not subject to the previouscriteria.b. <T3>Facility. </T3>CERCLA section 121(d)(3) provides that CERCLA cleanupwastes should be transferred only to a ``facility which is operated incompliance with sections 3004 and 3005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act[RCRA] (or, where applicable, in compliance with the Toxic Substances ControlAct [TSCA] or other applicable Federal law) and all applicable State requirements.''\3\<NOTE/> The term ``facility'' as it is used in that context couldrefer to any one of a number of concepts. For example, Congress could haveintended that in assessing compliance with any of the above statutes, EPAapply the definition of ``facility'' adopted by the applicable law. However,TSCA, for example, does not even employ the concept of ``facility,'' andits implementing regulations do not expressly define the term. Similarly,State laws may not define ``facility'' at all, or if they do, the definitionsmay differ from law to law and state to state. If more than one law orrequirement applies to a single area of land, there may be conflictingdefinitions of ``facility.'' Accordingly, in light of the fact that oneof the laws explicitly referenced by section 121(d)(3) does not define``facility'' at all, and in light of the potential for conflict betweenthe definitions of ``facility'' adopted by other laws, it seems unlikelythat Congress intended EPA to look to each individual law or requirementin defining this term. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Consistent with section 121(d)(2) of CERCLA, EPA interpretsthis requirement to refer to other applicable Federal and State environmentallaws. It is also possible that Congress intended the term ``facility'' in thefirst sentence of section 121(d)(3) to mean a facility as defined by RCRA.\4\<NOTE/> Indeed, the term ``facility'' is used in section 121(d)(3)(B),and in the context of that subparagraph, it is clear that the term meansa RCRA facility. It may be logical to assume that a term is meant to bedefined consistently throughout a single provision, thus suggesting that``facility'' in the first sentence of section 121(d)(3) also refers toa facility as defined by RCRA. However, it is not clear why the RCRA definitionof facility would be thought appropriate for purposes of assessing compliancewith the provisions of other laws, some of which, as noted above, may havevery different concepts of the nature of a facility. Moreover, as discussedbelow, the language of the second sentence of section 121(d)(3) is distinctfrom that in the first. While the first sentence refers to a ``facility,''subparagraph (B) clearly refers to a ``land disposal facility'' and tothe regulation of releases from such land disposal facilities under RCRA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A ``facility'' is broadly defined under RCRA to include``all continguous land, and structures * * * used for treating, storing,or disposing of hazardous waste * * * (including all) operational units.''40 CFR 261.10. Alternatively, Congress could have intended the term ``facility,'' as usedin the first sentence of CERLA section 121(d)(3), to mean a facility asdefined in the CERCLA statute itself. Section 101(9) of CERCLA states thata ``facility'' is any ``building, structure, * * * landfill, storage container,* * * site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stores,disposed of, or placed, or otherwise come to be located.'' Facilities underCERCLA are not defined by property boundaries or ownership, as they areunder RCRA; rather, they are defined by the placement or location of thewaste material or contamination itself. In the case of a transfer of CERCLAoff-site wastes to a facility, the most straightforward application ofthe CERCLA definition would be to interpret the ``facility'' as the unitor units at which the CERCLA off-site wastes have been ``deposited'' or``placed'' for treatment, storage or disposal. EPA recognizes that the definition of CERCLA section 101(9) may also extendto any area where hazardous substances migrate or ``come to be located,''and thus it could arguably be said to cover subsequent units at facilitieswhere hazardous substances may migrate. However, the ``come to be located''language appears to be designed to help effectuate the board remedial purposesof CERCLA, giving EPA the authority to clean up contamination when it hasspread from the original source. That part of the CERCLA section 101(9)definition does not apply in this context, where off-site wastes have beenspecifically ``placed'' or ``deposited'' at treatment, storage or disposalunits or facilities. Indeed, if Congress intended a CERCLA ``facility''to mean, in all cases, that area at which wastes have ``come to be located,''then it would not have included alternative terms, such as ``deposited,''``placed,'' or ``stored'' in the definition. Thus, under the CERCLA definition, the off-site ``facility'' would be thereceiving unit or units where the CERCLA wastes have been placed or deposited.Other units at the same site which are unrelated to the treatment, storageor disposal of the CERCLA cleanup wastes, or which receive residuals fromdisposal units, from treatment units using Best Demonstrated AvailableTechnology (``BDAT''), or from treatment units that reduce substantiallythe mobility, toxicity or persistence of the waste, would not be includedwithin the definition of ``facility'' for the purposes of assessing complianceunder this proposed rule.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Note that subparagraph (B) of section 121(d)(3) does providethat all releases from non-receiving units at RCRA land disposal facilitiesmust be controlled by a RCRA corrective action program before the facilitycan be used for the transfer of CERCLA off-site wastes. The plain language of the statute confirms EPA's discretion to define the``facility'' to which the compliance provision applies. Section 121(d)(3)applies to activities occurring in the context of a ``removal or remedialaction.'' In selecting a removal or remedial action, EPA has broad discretionunder CERCLA to identify how cleanup wastes should be managed and in whattype of unit or facility. Indeed, the scope of the response action, asidentified in the Record of Decision (ROD) or CERCLA decision document,defines the units to be used, and thus the units to be covered by the off-siterequirements. Accordingly, it is within EPA's statutory authority to interpretthe first sentence of CERCLA section 121(d)(3) to require that it is thereceiving units that must be in compliance with applicable Federal andState requirements. EPA's interpretation of ``facility'' in the first sentence of CERCLA section121(d)(3) is also consistent with the legislative purpose of that section.\6\<NOTE/> The legislative history of section 121(d)(3) states thatCERCLA off-site response actions ``must be designed and carefully monitoredto ensure that the proposed solutions to today's problems do not createnew, perhaps more serious problems tomorrow'' (H. Rept. 962, 99th Cong.,2d sess. at 248 (1986)). This purpose can be accomplished by ensuring thatthe unit(s) at which CERCLA wastes are received for treatment, storageor disposal are in compliance with applicable Federal and State requirements.It should be noted that violations affecting the entire waste managementoperation (such as failure to comply with financial requirements, inadequateclosure plan, inadequate waste analysis plan, inadequate inspection plan,etc.) are considered to be relevant violations which affect the receivingunit. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Where the language of a statute is unclear or ambiguous,it is appropriate to define the term in a manner that best effectuateswhat the Agency perceives to be the Congressional intent in enacting theprovision. <T3>See Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </T3>447U.S. 102, 108 (1980).EPA's interpretation would also further a second Congressional objective,expressed elsewhere in CERCLA section 121, which directs the Agency toselect site remedies which utilize ``permanent solutions and alternativetreatment technologies to the maximum extent possible'' (CERCLA section121(d)(1)). Nationwide, there are only a small number of state-of-the artincinerators and alternative treatment technologies that are presentlyavailable to treat hazardous wastes and substances. Reading a broad definitionof ``facility'' (such as the property-wide definition under RCRA) intoCERCLA section 121(d)(3) would preclude the use of fully complying units_likeincinerators_at sites with other violations, even if such violations pertainedto units or processes not associated with the storage, treatment, or disposalof CERCLA wastes; this could threaten available incineration capacity,and therefore Congressional goals. Rather, today's interpretation resultsin a better balance of competing Congressional objectives: that CERCLAwaste goes to receiving units that are in compliance and that this wastebe disposed of using permanent remedies and alternative treatment technologiesto the maximum extent possible. It also has the advantage of tying compliancerequirements to those units that are logically related to the managementof CERCLA waste, rather than extending it to other parts of a site notinvolved in or related to the management of CERCLA waste.  The foregoing approach to defining ``facility is not inconsistent withthe second sentence of CERCLA section 121(d)(3), which provides that whenCERCLA cleanup wastes are transferred off-site to land disposal facilities(1) the unit to which the waste is transferred must not be releasing, and(2) all releases from other units must be controlled under a RCRA correctiveaction program. Unlike the first sentence of section 121(d)(3), which refersto ``facility,'' the second sentence specifies ``land disposal facility,''which the statute makes clear is a reference to a RCRA facility. Specifically,the statute provides in the second sentence of section 121(d)(3), thatreleases from other units at a land disposal facility must be controlledby a corrective action program approved under RCRA; as a matter of law,RCRA corrective action applies only to RCRA facilities. In addition, section121(d)(3) (A) and (B) make a clear distinction between a ``unit'' and a``facility,'' a distinction most commonly recognized in the context ofRCRA.  In light of the above, EPA believes that it is appropriate to define ``facility''as it is used in the first sentence of section 121(d)(3) as the receivingunit(s) which directly treats, stores or disposes of the CERCLA off-sitewaste. It is also appropriate, in the second sentence of section 121(d)(3),to define ``land disposal facility'' consistent with RCRA, to include boththe receiving unit (for purposes of implementing the no release provisionin section 121(d)(3)(A)) as well as other units (for purposes of section121(d)(3)(B)). EPA believes that this is consistent with the principlesof statutory construction and with legislative intent.  c. <T3>Relevant Violations. </T3>CERCLA section 121(d)(3) and the originaland revised off-site policies require that hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants transferred off-site for treatment, storage, or dispoalduring a CERCLA response action be transferred to a facility operatingin compliance with RCRA, TSCA, or other applicable Federal law and withState law. However, in evaluating ``compliance,'' EPA has recognized thatthe comprehensive regulations governing waste management include requirementsof differing importance. For example, in the RCRA Enforcement ResponsePolicy (OSWER Directive andplusmin;9900.0, December 21, 1984, and subsequentrevisions), the Agency set out guidance for treating violations of certainrequirements more seriously than others (Class I vs. Class II violations).Congress also acknowledged this distinction in the legislative historyof this section: ``In implementing this provision, the Agency should giveappropriate consideration to the significance of the violations, includingClass I violations as compared with minor paperwork violations,'' H. Rept.962, 99th Cong., 2d sess. at 248 (1986). For these reasons, EPA believesthat the assessment of compliance required by statute should focus on whetherthere are violations of the more important provisions. Therefore, any determinationof noncompliance should be based on ``relevant violations,'' which theAgency is defining in this regulation as those that are a significant deviationfrom regulations, compliance order provisions, or permit conditions, includingthose designed to: ensure that hazardous waste is destined for and deliveredto authorized facilities; prevent releases of hazardous waste, hazardousconstituents, or hazardous substances to the environment; ensure earlydetection of such releases; or compel corrective action for releases. ClassI violations, as defined in the RCRA Enforcement Response Policy, are thetype of violations that will generally be considered relevant violations. CERCLA section 121(d)(3) also specifically requires off-site facilitiesto be in compliance with other applicable Federal and State requirements.EPA interprets ``applicable State requirements'' consistent with section121(d)(2) of CERCLA in that they must be legally enforceable and generallyapplicable. Relevance of violations of other applicable Federal and Statelaws will be judged using criteria similar to those used for RCRA SubtitleC facilities, considering the significance of the requirement that is beingviolated; the extent of deviation from the requirement; and the potentialor actual threat to human health or the environment. Criminal violationsof any type will be considered relevant violations at the time an indictmentis issued and may, in appropriate cases, be considered relevant beforean indictment is issued. d. <T3>Minimum Technology Requirements. </T3>In order to be acceptable toreceive hazardous wastes from a CERCLA cleanup under this rule, a RCRASubtitle C land disposal unit would also be required to demonstrate compliancewith the minimum technology requirements of RCRA section 3004(o), unlessthe unit had been granted a waiver under the section.Although under the RCRA program, only new RCRA land disposal units (andsuch units at expanded facilities) must meet the more rigorous minimumtechnology requirements, EPA believes that it is appropriate to apply themto units receiving hazardous wastes from CERCLA cleanups under the off-siterule. EPA believes that such an approach furthers the general purposesof CERCLA section 121(d)(1) to select a remedial action that utilizes permanentsolutions to the maximum extent practicable, and to take into account,when selecting the remedy, ``the long-term uncertainties associated withland disposal'' and the potential for future remedial action costs if thechosen remedy in question were to fail. As the Conference Report on SARAstated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The response and remedial actions taken by EPA under this programmust be designed and carefully monitored to ensure that the proposed solutionsto today's problems do not create new, perhaps more serious problems tomorrow.<T3>This is an especially important responsibility when the waste materialis removed to a land disposal facility that, if improperly operated inviolation of RCRA requirements, could contaminate ground water or surfacewater and thereby present threats to human health and the environment.</T3>(H. Rept. 962, 99th Cong., 2d sess., at 248 (1986) (emphasis added).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Release Criteria</ITAG>a. <T3>Definition of Release. </T3>The term ``release'' is defined by section101(22) of CERCLA and andSection; 300.6 of the NCP. As such, a release isconsidered to be any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying,discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing intothe environment.EPA is interpreting the term ``release'' in CERCLA section 121(d)(3) toinclude ``substantial threat of release,'' consistent with the definitionin andSection;300.6 of the NCP.\7\<NOTE/> The NCP definition is especially significant because thatdocument provides the procedures for taking response actions at CERCLAsites, including the decision of which facility should receive wastes fromCERCLA response actions (this proposed rule will be part of the NCP).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Agency's interpretation of the term ``release'' wasdiscussed in the ``Interpretation of Section 3008(h) of the Solid WasteDisposal Act'' (J. Winston Porter, December 16, 1985).Moreover, the EPA believes that it is important to take into account informationas to a substantial threat of release as well as an actual release in makingoff-site transfer decisions. If the Agency has information indicating thata release is threatened at a potential receiving unit, a decision to authorizethe transfer of wastes to that site would be poor public policy, and notprotective of human health and the environment.The Agency has interpreted the concept of release as used in section 121(d)(3)of CERCLA not to include <T3>de minimis </T3>releases, consistent with the legislative history.\8\<NOTE/> <T3>De minimis </T3>releases are those that do not adversely affect publichealth or the environment, such as releases to the air from temporary openingand closing of bungs, releases between landfill liners of 5 gallons/acre/dayor less, or stack emissions from incinerators not otherwise subject toClean Air Act permits. The Agency further believes that Federally-permittedreleases, as defined in CERCLA section 101(10), are generally controlledor monitored under another Federal program and thus should not be routinelyincluded within the concept of ``release'' for the purposes of section121(d)(3). For example, the presence of a Federally-permitted water dischargepoint should not preclude EPA's ability to use a facility for the receiptof CERCLA wastes. This would also apply to releases authorized under Federalprograms delegated to the State. However, if that release comes to constitutea threat to human health or the environment, the release can and shouldbe considered under this rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The SARA Conference Report provides as follows: ``Theaddition of `soil' to the requirements of (CERCLA section 121)(d)(3)(A)is intended to preclude the transfer or disposal of hazardous wastes orconstituents thereof into unlined units and lined units with releases <T3>other than de minimis releases </T3>into the soil.'' H. Rept. 962,99th Cong., 2d sess. at 248 (1986) (emphasis added).Although CERCLA section 121(d)(3) (A) and (B) refer to ``hazardous wastes''and ``hazardous constituents'' only, the provisions of the proposed rulewould apply to releases of all CERCLA hazardous substances. The Agencybelieves that this is appropriate for two reasons: first, to allow thetransfer of CERCLA wastes to units leaking hazardous substances such asradionuclides, asbestos, captan, diquat, or malathion (which are not regulatedhazardous wastes or hazardous constituents under RCRA) would be clearlycontrary to Congress' intent that CERCLA ``not create more serious problems''(H. Rept. 962, 99th Cong., 2d sess. at 248 (1986)); second, common sensedictates that the Agency not put CERCLA wastes into a known releasing unit,regardless of the substances being released. Thus EPA believes it is bothlogical and appropriate to apply today's proposed rule more broadly tocover units that have uncontrolled releases of any CERCLA hazardous substance.EPA believes that in some cases it may not be necessary to have actualsampling data to determine whether there is a release or a substantialthreat of a release. An inspector may find other evidence that a releasehas occurred, such as a broken dike or feed line at a surface impoundment.Less obvious indications of a release might also be adequate to make thedetermination. For example, EPA or a qualifying State (``the responsibleAgency'') could have sufficient information on the contents of a land disposalunit, the design and operating characteristics of the unit, and/or thehydrogeology of the area in which the unit is located to conclude thatthere has been a release to ground water, surface water, soils, land surfaceor air.RCRA interim status facilities that trigger groundwater assessment monitoringrequirements (40 CFR 265.93) and RCRA-permitted facilities that triggercompliance monitoring requirements (40 CFR 264.99) are not automaticallypresumed to have releases. The RCRA regulations provide for verificationof the initial release determination through additional sampling to ascertainwhether the statistically significant difference which triggered the enhancedmonitoring was the result of problems such as laboratory error. Upon verificationof the data, the facility must initiate assessment or compliance monitoring.The responsible Agency should evaluate the data which led to assessmentor compliance monitoring and any other relevant information, includingthat gathered from applicable compliance inspections before making itsdetermination under this rule. Of course, if the responsible Agency hasdata sufficient to make a determination of a release and unacceptabilityprior to (or during) a facility's participation in the assessment or compliancemonitoring program, the responsible Agency may do so at that time.b. <T3>Release Criteria for Facilities Receiving Post-SARA Waste. </T3>CERCLAsection 121(d)(3)(A) requires that CERCLA wastes resulting from post-SARAdecision documents must not be transferred to a unit at a RCRA SubtitleC land disposal facility that is releasing any hazardous waste or hazardousconstituent into the ground water, surface water, or soil. The term ``landdisposal facility'' means any RCRA facility at which a land disposal unitis located, regardless of whether the land disposal unit is the receivingunit (land disposal units include landfills, surface impoundments, landtreatment units, and piles as defined in 40 CFR 260.10).\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See, e.g., the RCRA Codification Rule, 50 FR 2670 (July15, 1985); the RCRA Land Disposal Regulations, 47 FR 32274 (July 26, 1982);and 49 FR 5854 (February 15, 1984).Although CERCLA section 121(d)(3)(A) specifically refers to releases to``the ground water or surface water or soil'' only, it is the opinion ofEPA that as a matter of policy, the Agency should also refrain from sendingCERCLA cleanup wastes to a site if the receiving unit is releasing hazardoussubstances into the air. Such an approach is consistent with the goalsof the policy and with environmental protection.Today's proposed rule would also apply this restriction to RCRA storageand treatment facilities whose units are intended to receive CERCLA wastesresulting from post-SARA decision documents. Although CERCLA sections 121(d)(3)(A) and (B) specifically mention RCRA ``land disposal facilities'' only,the Agency believes that the storage and treatment of RCRA hazardous wastespose similar threats of releases that could harm human health or the environmenteven though the wastes are managed differently. EPA believes that it isappropriate to refrain from sending CERCLA cleanup wastes to leaking unitsat RCRA treatment or storage facilities, consistent with the requirementin CERCLA section 121(b)(1) to ``select a remedial action that is protectiveof human health and the environment,'' and with the general environmentalprotection standard for response actions in CERCLA section 104(a)(1). Therefore,under the proposed rule, the Agency would not transfer CERCLA wastes toany RCRA Subtitle C treatment or storage facility, or to any facility thathas a RCRA permit-by-rule under 40 CFR 270.60 (a), (b) or (c), if thereare releases from the receiving unit (or, as discussed below, if thereare environmentally significant releases from non-receiving units thatare not controlled by corrective action).CERCLA section 121(d)(3)(B) also specifically restricts the use of landdisposal facilities that have releases at units other than those actuallyreceiving CERCLA wastes. These ``other units'' are defined as all permittedor interim status units and other solid waste management units at a facility.Releases from other units at a land disposal facility must be addressedby a corrective action program approved by EPA or a State authorized forHSWA corrective action in an enforceable agreement under the applicablestatute, in order for the facility to be considered acceptable. This appliesequally to Underground Injection Control (``UIC'') wells where surfaceunits are land disposal units with RCRA status (<T3>see </T3>52 FR 45791, Dec. 1, 1987) as well as to publicly owned treatmentworks (POTWs) with land disposal units.The requirement for a corrective action program is in lieu of a ``no release''requirement and is specifically provided for in CERCLA section 121(d)(3)(B)for other units at land disposal facilities. This provision recognizesthat the corrective action process can be very lengthy. Requiring the correctiveaction process to be completed at other units could render the facilityunacceptable for many years, potentially precluding an otherwise acceptablefacility from receiving CERCLA waste.For reasons discussed above, EPA is also proposing to set out requirementsto control releases from non-receiving units at non-land disposal facilitiesthat receive CERCLA cleanup wastes, including RCRA treatment, storage andpermit-by-rule facilities. Under the proposed rule, the standard of ``environmentalsignificance''_developed under the May 1985 Off-site Policy_would be applied.Releases from non-receiving units at these facilities must be determinednot to be environmentally significant, or must be addressed by a correctiveaction program in an enforceable agreement under the applicable statute,in order for the facility to be acceptable. EPA is applying the standardof environmental significance to these units in lieu of the more restrictive``any release'' standard imposed on other units at Subtitle C land disposalfacilities, because the Agency believes this standard is adequate to protecthuman health and the environment, and to meet the objectives of this rule.Facilities other than RCRA Subtitle C facilities are not addressed in CERCLAsection 121(d)(3) (A) or (B), and thus no release criteria are statutorilyrequired. However, EPA believes that it is appropriate not to use suchfacilities for the receipt of wastes from CERCLA-authorized or -fundedresponse actions if the Agency receives information, or discovers duringthe course of a compliance inspection, that there are environmentally significantreleases of hazardous substances anywhere on the site. Of course, if suchreleases are addressed by a corrective action program, then the facilitymay be deemed acceptable.POTWs that do not accept RCRA hazardous wastes (i.e., POTWs that do nothave a RCRA permit-by-rule) are not considered to be RCRA Subtitle C facilities.CERCLA wastes (other than RCRA hazardous wastes) that are transferred toa POTW must meet the appropriate pre-treatment standards.\10\<NOTE/> CERCLA wastes that are RCRA hazardous wastes may only betransferred to a POTW that has a RCRA permit-by-rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Criteria for evaluating whether or not to send CERCLAcleanup wastes to a POTW have been discussed in an EPA memorandum datedApril 15, 1986, entitled, ``Discharge of Wastewater from CERCLA Sites intoPOTWs.''c. <T3>Release Criteria for Facilities Receiving Pre-SARA Waste. </T3>TheMay 1985 policy, from which the acceptability criteria for facilities receivingCERCLA wastes resulting from pre-SARA decision documents are derived, doesnot refer specifically to releases. Rather, it directs that CERCLA wastenot be sent to a facility if there are environmental conditions at thefacility (other than relevant violations) that pose a significant threatto public health, welfare or the environment or affect the satisfactoryoperation of the facility (``relevant conditions''). Examples of environmentalconditions that may be considered relevant conditions include: environmentallysignificant releases of hazardous wastes, hazardous constituents or hazardoussubstances to ground water, surface water, soil, ground surface or air;a high degree of hazard posed by the location of the facility; the facility'sability to manage safely the volume and/or toxicity of the waste.The responsible Agency will evaluate releases and other environmental conditionsat the facility to determine whether they constitute relevant conditionsunder this rule. Where such relevant conditions exist, a corrective actionplan under the applicable statute is required before the facility may beconsidered acceptable to receive CERCLA cleanup wastes.B. Basis for Determining AcceptabilityTo determine the acceptability of a facility to receive an off-site transferof CERCLA waste, the responsible Agency will follow certain proceduresto examine the facility's status with respect to both compliance and releases.States not qualifying to make the off-site determination may submit findingsto EPA concerning a facility's compliance status.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Compliance Determination</ITAG>To determine compliance status, the responsible Agency will direct theinspection of a facility no more than six months prior to its receivingCERCLA waste. This applies to facilities accepting CERCLA wastes resultingfrom either pre- or post-SARA decision documents.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Release Determination</ITAG>Under the May 1985 off-site policy, the decisionmaker had the discretionto use a facility that had releases, unless the releases constituted environmentalconditions that affected the satisfactory operation of the facility. Thisprovision still applies to wastes from pre-SARA decisions, and the responsibleAgency should use the compliance inspection noted above as the means ofidentifying any relevant conditions.For post-SARA decisions, SARA now requires that ``all releases from otherunits at a land disposal facility'' be controlled under a corrective actionprogram. This rule would similarly require that all ``environmentally significant''releases at non-receiving units at RCRA Subtitle C facilities that arenot land disposal facilities be controlled. To best effect these requirements,EPA believes it is important to assess whether any units at a site havereleases, if that information is not already known, before transferringwastes to that site.For all RCRA Subtitle C facilities, the responsible Agency should performa RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) or other facility-wide investigation (e.g.,a CERCLA Preliminary Assessment/Site Investigation (PA/SI)) at the siteto determine if a release has occurred or if there is a substantial threatof a release. If a release has been identified outside of the scope ofan RFA or equivalent investigation, completion of such an investigationis not necessary prior to initiating a corrective action program. In suchsituations, the corrective action program should be designed to includea facility-wide investigation. All RCRA land disposal facilities must alsohave received a comprehensive ground-water monitoring evaluation (CME)or an operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) inspection within the year priorto receipt of waste.For non-Subtitle C facilities, the compliance inspection should also serveto identify any environmentally significant releases.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Notification of Acceptability</ITAG>A. BackgroundIt is EPA's opinion that the decision to send wastes from a CERCLA responseaction to a particular off-site facility, or to send them off-site at all,is a legitimate business decision within the Agency's discretion. EPA recognizesthat a valid RCRA Subtitle C permit creates the opportunity for a commercialfacility to receive those wastes specified in the permit. However, thepermit does not guarantee the use of the facility by the Government anymore than it guarantees use of the facility by a private waste generator.EPA must remain free to decide whether and where to send wastes from CERCLA-fundedor -authorized cleanups in order to protect its own interests (e.g., limitingthe Government's potential liability for harm arising from the operationof the receiving facility and not contributing to existing environmentalproblems).EPA recognizes that there will be instances where a facility will be deemedunacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes based on conditions that may notconstitute a violation of RCRA (e.g., observed releases of hazardous substances).However, SARA specifically called upon the Agency to exercise a high levelof care and not to use facilities experiencing uncontrolled releases, evenif remediation of that release is not immediately required under RCRA regulations.The language of CERCLA section 121(d)(3) (A) and (B) provides a conservativestandard: if EPA determines that there are releases at a RCRA land disposalfacility that have not been addressed by a corrective action program, thenEPA may not send wastes there.Some companies have already expressed concern that decisions by EPA notto use a facility may have a secondary effect on public confidence withregard to that facility; however, EPA believes that any such secondaryeffects will be minor. Any stigma resulting from the Agency deciding notto use a facility to receive CERCLA wastes due to a compliance problemwould arise even without that decision, due to the Notice of Violationand the enforcement action that would follow under RCRA (or other applicablestatutes). An EPA decision not to use a facility is simply a response to,and recognition of, the finding of a violation. In the context of uncontrolledreleases that technically are not RCRA violations, a decision not to usea facility indicates that EPA believes that there is a release or a significantthreat of release at the facility warranting investigation, and based onthe conservative standard set by Congress in CERCLA section 121(d)(3) (A)and (B), EPA is exercising its discretion not to use such facilities untilthe releases are addressed. When evaluated in context, then, the EPA decisionis simply a conservative business decision not to use a facility with knownor potential problems. It is also reasonable to assume that Congress, byrequiring EPA to make such conservative decisions, understood that facilities_includingthose that are in compliance with RCRA but have some uncontrolled releases_wouldbe identified by EPA as unacceptable to receive CERCLA cleanup wastes.B. Notice and Review ProceduresThe only statutory requirement for notice and review associated with EPA'soff-site transfer decisions appears in CERCLA section 121(d)(3): ``ThePresident shall notify the owner or operator of such a facility of determinationsunder this paragraph.'' However, EPA has established additional proceduralprotections for affected facilities that are intended to ensure that off-sitepolicy determinations are made in a careful and consistent manner, basedon knowledge of available facts. This is consistent with the approach recommendedin the Conference Report on SARA, which provides the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The President must notify owners or operators of facilities of anydetermination under this paragraph * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Managers further expect that the owner or operator of a facilitywill be provided with an opportunity to meet informally prior to a finaldetermination of eligibility except with regard to emergency removal actions.The Administrator is expected to establish post-determination proceduresfor resolving disputes related to determinations made under subparagraphs(A) and (B) * * *. Until the conclusion of such rulemaking, the Administratorshall implement these provisions on the basis of the statutory terms. (H.Rept. 962, 99th Cong., 2d sess. at 248 (1986).)</ITAG>In keeping with Congressional intent, upon determination that a relevantviolation and/or release has occurred, the responsible Agency will notifythe facility owner/operator in writing of the determination and of theeffect of the determination under this rule.In addition, the November 1987 revised off-site policy provides a 60-dayreview period during which the owner/operators of receiving facilitiescan meet with responsible EPA Regional Office officials (or, if appropriate,State officials) to discuss alleged violations or releases while retainingtheir acceptability under the Off-site Policy. If after receiving factsand comments, the responsible Agency still considers the facility to beunacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes, the facility has the opportunityto request that the EPA Regional Administrator (RA) (or appropriate Stateofficial) review the unacceptability determination. Under the November1987 policy, the RA or appropriate State official may use discretion indeciding whether to review the determination.Today's proposed rule largely adopts these procedures but modifies themby making review by the RA (or appropriate State official) available toall requesting parties. EPA is proposing this change in the interest ofassuring accuracy and consistency of decisions. Giving facilities the opportunityto elevate disagreements to the highest official in the EPA Region (orauthorized State Agency) provides access to a second objective decisionmaker,who brings a fresh perspective to the facts presented at the informal conference.The specific review activities provided under the proposed rule are asfollows. The notice of unacceptability should be issued as soon as possibleafter the findings of a relevant violation or release, and should clearlystate whether it applies to pre-SARA wastes, post-SARA wastes, or both.It should also clearly state the units or units to which the notice applies.Within 10 calendar days from the time the responsible Agency issues a notice,the owner/operator has the opportunity to request an informal conferencewith the responsible Agency to discuss the basis of the underlying violationor release determination, and its relevance to the facility's acceptabilityto receive wastes from CERCLA-authorized or -funded response actions. Anysuch meeting should be scheduled to occur within 30 calendar days of issuanceof the notice. The owner/operator also has the option of submitting writtencomments within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice, in lieu ofrequesting an informal conference. After the informal conference or thesubmittal of written comments, the responsible Agency will inform the owner/operatorin writing whether the information provided is sufficient to support adetermination of acceptability. If not, transfer of CERCLA waste to thefacility will cease on the 60th calendar day after issuance of the originalnotice.The owner/operator may also request, within 10 calendar days of hearingfrom the responsible Agency after the informal conference or submittalof written comments, that the RA or appropriate State official review thedetermination, if possible, within the 60-calendar-day period from theissuance of the notice of unacceptability. The RA or State official mayconduct such a review based upon the record compiled to date or by meansof a conference. Such a review does not automatically stay the determinationbut the responsible Agency may use its discretion to extend the 60-dayperiod if it needs more time to review information presented. The Agencybelieves this discretionary authority may be necessary in situations whereadditional time is needed to confirm an unacceptability determination,such as waiting for laboratory results, or to review complex informationpresented during the conference or in written comments.EPA believes that the time period provided for review and opportunity torebut the Government's findings satisfy the three majors underlying theAgency's provision of the 60-day review period: Congressional intent, dueprocess concerns, and considerations for the efficient management of CERCLAcleanup wastes.First, the 60-day period with recourse to two separate levels of decisionmakersfully protects the rights of affected facilities' owner/operators to dueprocess. It also responds to the intent in the legislative history fora significant review period. Although alternatives have been considered,the Agency believes that a longer or more complicated dispute resolutionprocess could result in situations where wastes could continue to be sentto facilities with unaddressed violations or releases during periods upto or exceeding several months, clearly in opposition to Congressionalintent and contrary to the need for relatively quick decisions as to whatoff-site locations to use for CERCLA waste disposal.Further, the 60-day period was also selected based on the need for theefficient management of CERCLA cleanup wastes. EPA is concerned that ifall off-site unacceptability determinations were immediately effective,then many CERCLA cleanups would be disrupted, with truckloads of wastesprevented from reaching the designated management point, and forced toreturn to the original CERCLA site. The establishment of a 60-day periodbefore the determination takes effect provides the Agency with adequatetime to identify alternate management options and to accomplish the closureof the original contract without unreasonable increases in costs.However, there may be situations where the responsible Agency decides thata facility's unacceptability is immediately effective. This could occurin situations such as, but not limited to, emergencies at the facility(e.g., fires or explosions), egregious violations (e.g., criminal violations),or other situations that render the facility incapable of safely handlingCERCLA waste. Egregious violations include criminal violations where acriminal indictment has been issued; repeated violations of statutory orregulatory requirements indicating that a facility is unable to safelymanage wastes; refusal to comply with outstanding orders or decrees callingfor compliance or corrective actions; and violations that result in animmediate threat to human health or the environment. A Class I violationof RCRA in and of itself generally will not trigger immediate unacceptabilityunless it meets one of the above criteria or otherwise renders the unitincapable of safely handling wastes.In case of either an extension or immediate unacceptability, the facilityshould be notified as quickly as possible.Implementation of this notice provision does not replace existing enforcementmechanisms under RCRA or CERCLA nor does it relieve the Regions or Statesof the duty to take appropriate enforcement action under RCRA or CERCLA.This notice provision shall be applied only in concert with section 300.440of the NCP. It does not create additional rights to notice or review ofviolations in other contexts.C. Administrative and Judicial AppealsEPA has also been considering the issue of how the offsite policy shouldbe applied in situations where a facility has been determined to be acceptableto receive off-site wastes based on its implementation of corrective actionto control releases at a facility, but that action is interrupted by alengthy administrative or judicial challenge concerning the underlyingcorrective action or the need to perform additional corrective action.EPA is concerned that a decision to stay the off-site rule during suchadministrative appeals (or court challenges) would act as an incentiveto parties to file dilatory appeals and, equally troubling, would resultin situations where EPA continued to send CERCLA wastes to facilities withreleases but no ongoing corrective action program. Therefore, under theproposed rule, if the filing of an administrative or judicial challengeto a corrective action requirement interrupts a program to control releasesat a facility, it may be appropriate to issue an off-site unacceptabilitydetermination.Some parties have argued that at least in the administrative context, aslong as a RCRA facility is subject to a permit that provides for some correctiveaction, any releases at the facility should be considered to be under acorrective action ``program'' and thus ``controlled,'' even during thosetimes when the facility is appealing modifications to the permit that wouldinitiate or require subsequent phases of corrective action (see 40 CFR270.41 and 124.5).\11\<NOTE/> EPA disagrees with this expansive reading. First, as a purelyfactual matter, releases are not being ``controlled'' during the periodof time required to resolve the appeal of such a permit modification, andthe procedures inherent in such an appeal_including public comment, hearing,and an appeal to EPA's Chief Judicial Officer_lead to typical delays of2-3 years. To broaden the interpretation of a corrective action programand of off-site acceptability to include long periods during which no correctiveaction is taking place would run counter to Congress' intent that EPA notsend CERCLA wastes to facilities with uncontrolled releases, and wouldcause serious delays in corrective action at the site. It is importantto note as well that the delays and procedures inherent in the permit modificationprocess were established to protect the rights of permittees and citizensto challenge changes in the permit; they are wholly apart from the off-sitepolicy determination. The business decision of where to send wastes underthe off-site policy would turn not on whether the proposed permit modificationis a proper one_as would be the debate in the RCRA permitting context_buton whether there is a corrective action program ongoing at the facilitysatisfying CERCLA section 121(d)(3) (A) and (B), such that EPA has confidencein sending CERCLA wastes to the facility under the strict and conservativestandard Congress has established. This test would not be met during theperiod a permittee is challenging the need to take corrective action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Note that this issue arises in the context of an appealof a permit modification, and not in the context of an appeal of the initialissuance of an operating permit under RCRA. In the latter case, the appealwould stay the effectiveness of the entire permit, meaning that no permitwould be in effect (40 CFR 124.16); thus, no argument could be made thatreleases at the facility are being controlled under the ``corrective actionprogram'' of the permit, and that the facility is therefore acceptableunder the off-site rule. An appeal of a permit modification would not staythe effectiveness of the underlying permit and its corrective action requirements,if any.EPA acknowledges, however, that the application of the off-site policywhile an appeal of a permit modification is pending may appear to placea burden on the permittee in certain cases. For example, the selectionof a remedy under the RCRA permitting process is customarily accomplishedby a permit modification under 40 CFR 270.41. Even if the facility agreesto implement the remedy proposed by EPA and not to appeal the permit modificationthat incorporates the selected remedy, a citizens' group may appeal thatpermit modification (e.g., on the grounds that the remedy is not stringentenough). In such a case, the facility is willing to take corrective action,but the program has been halted by actions outside of the facility's control.In an effort to balance EPA's need for an effective and independent off-sitepolicy with the legitimate concerns of parties to pursue, or not be adverselyaffected by the pursuit of, legitimate appeals of the Agency's correctiveaction decisions, EPA is proposing a procedure for interim periods whensuch administrative (or judicial) challenges are pending. Under this procedure,a facility could remain acceptable to receive CERCLA wastes from EPA cleanupsif: (1) It satisfies EPA that adequate corrective action will continueat the facility (e.g., through interim corrective action measures, ground-watermonitoring, and/or site stabilization steps), or (2) it demonstrates toEPA the absence of a need to take corrective action measures over the short-term,interim period of the appeal (e.g., in light of site conditions and themore permanent corrective action scheduled to take place upon the resolutionof the appeal). Such issues would be considered during the 60-day reviewperiod in the context of the informal conference and the RA's (or appropriateState official's) review. In this way, facilities appealing their permitmodifications would have the choice of taking some corrective action duringthe appeal period (or showing that none is needed immediately) and thusremaining acceptable to receive CERCLA wastes from EPA cleanups, or ofnot taking any interim measures and potentially triggering CERCLA section121(d)(3) (A) and (B) unacceptability. This procedure also allows EPA toprotect its interests by retaining its ability to decide not to send itswastes to sites where uncontrolled releases of hazardous wastes were occurring,thereby protecting its interests and respecting the mandates establishedby Congress. EPA is proposing to follow these procedures in the event of a judicialchallenge to corrective action as well as an administrative one; however,the Agency believes that the prudential considerations that led the Agencyto suggest this review process during permit modification appeals are lesscompelling for judicial challenges. Off-site policy implications may also arise when dispute resolution proceduresare invoked in a permit, order or decree, interrupting corrective actionactivities. EPA believes that these procedures, which are generally providedto resolve minor disagreements, present a smaller risk of causing delaysin corrective action. Very often, such procedures run their course withinthe 60-day review period provided for under the proposed off-site rule.Thus, EPA believes that it is unnecessary to routinely trigger the off-siteacceptability procedures in such cases; however, the Agency reserves theright to do so where the dispute resolution procedures threaten to significantlydelay corrective action beyond the 60-day period. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Re-evaluating Unacceptability </ITAG>If a facility deemed unacceptable prevails on the merits in an administrativeor judicial challenge to the finding of noncompliance or uncontrolled releasesupon which the unacceptability determination was based, then the facilitywill be deemed to be acceptable under the proposed rule. EPA has limitedthis ground for returning to acceptability to prevailing ``on the merits''in a challenge to Agency action. EPA believes that a judgment or decisionbased on procedural or technical grounds that does not contradict the findingof noncompliance or uncontrolled releases should not allow a facility toreturn to acceptability; to do otherwise would be inconsistent with theplain meaning of CERCLA section 121(d)(3) and the purposes of the off-sitepolicy and proposed rule. <T3>A. Compliance Criteria </T3>Facilities with relevant violations may regain acceptability to receivepre- or post-SARA wastes by returning to physical compliance for violationscited in the notice. A facility that is determined to be unacceptable toreceive CERCLA wastes under the off-site policy based on a ``relevant violation''may not regain acceptability until it has returned to physical compliance.In most cases, the facility can return to its previolation compliance conditionby taking certain remedial actions, and the inquiry is relatively straightforward.For instance, in cases where the violation concerns the placement in alandfill cell of incompatible wastes that are deemed to pose an environmentalhazard, the Agency will generally require the removal of the incompatiblewastes from the cell in order to return to physical compliance.Occasionally, however, there may be situations where it is not possibleto physically ``un-do'' the results of a violation. For example, a facilitythat takes waste for which it is not permitted and treats it in a surfaceimpoundment, incinerates it, or disposes of it in a landfill in such away that its removal would cause greater danger than leaving it in place,will not be able to retrieve the waste. EPA believes that in such cases,it is appropriate to consider the units to have regained physical complianceand hence be acceptable under the off-site rule if the following conditionsare met:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The violation does not render the unit unsafe or incapable of properlymanaging waste,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The violation does not pose a threat to human health or the environment,and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The facility has completed all actions that the responsible Agencydetermines are necessary to rectify the violation and prevent it from recurring.</ITAG>In most cases this will mean that: (1) All legal proceedings, punitiveactions and other obligations related to that violation are resolved, and(2) the facility has implemented a system approved by the responsible Agencythat will assure the violation does not recur.EPA did consider the alternate approach of declaring that unpermitted wastesin a unit should be said to forever ``taint'' the cell (preventing a futurefinding of ``physical'' compliance for purposes of the off-site rule) ifthose wastes cannot be physically removed. Although this approach may havemerit in situations where the unpermitted wastes pose a threat to healthor the environment, the Agency believes that it would be contrary to theinterests of effective operation of the off-site policy and effective operationof the CERCLA program, to prohibit any future use of such units by EPAin cases where no environmental or health threat has occurred.The logic behind this interpretation is clear by example. In an incineratorwere to accept and burn wastes not authorized by its permit, it will bedeemed to be in violation. However, it may be infeasible to correct theconsequences of that error, and indeed, there may be no environmental orhealth basis for attempting to expunge all physical traces of the violation.The appropriate remedy may be to issue a penalty and to require new proceduresfor reviewing waste types. However, it would not make good sense to statethat the incinerator is forever unacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes,even after it has instituted proper management procedures and shown theAgency that it can safely handle wastes.The fundamental purposes of the off-site rule are to ensure that the Agencyuses environmentally sound facilities, and does not contribute to problemsites (thereby subjecting EPA to increased potential liability). Neitherof these purposes would be frustrated by a policy that allowed wastes tobe sent to a facility that EPA has determined to have returned to soundoperation, and that is found to be equipped to handle additional wastessafely and properly. A contrary approach would make many environmentallysound waste disposal facilities unavailable to the Agency, thereby limitingthe Agency's options for proper waste disposal.The responsible Agency must verify the return to compliance through eithera regularly scheduled inspection or, at its discretion, a special inspection,prior to determining acceptability. Facilities regaining acceptabilityshould be notified in writing.B. Release Criteria for Facilities Receiving Post-SARA Wastes<ITAG tagnum="81">1. RCRA Subtitle C Facilities_Releases at Receiving Units</ITAG>RCRA Subtitle C facilities receiving wastes resulting from post-SARA decisiondocuments, with receiving units deemed unacceptable because of releases,may regain acceptability by eliminating those releases. In addition, theymust control any contamination that occurred as a result of the releaseunder a permit or correction action order approved under Subtitle C ofRCRA.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. RCRA Subtitle C Facilities_Releases at Non-Receiving Units</ITAG>RCRA Subtitle C land disposal facilities deemed unacceptable because ofreleases occurring at <T3>other</T3> units, and RCRA Subtitle C treatment, storage, and permit-by-rulefacilities deemed unacceptable because of environmentally significant releasesat other units, may regain acceptability by entering into an enforceableagreement, with the responsible Agency, to investigate the problems.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Corrective Action Orders/Agreements</ITAG>Acceptable agreements under Subtitle C of RCRA include a corrective actionorder under section 3008(h), section 7003 or section 3013; permit provisionsunder 40 CFR 264.100 or 264.101 (or appropriate authority in a State authorizedfor HSWA corrective action); and an order under an equivalent authorityin a State authorized for HSWA corrective action.Releases from any unit at a RCRA facility will be considered controlledby a corrective action program upon issuance of the order or permit containingthe requirement to initiate and complete one or more of the following:A RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI), a Corrective Measures Study, or CorrectiveMeasures Implementation. This is consistent with both the RCRA and Superfundcorrective action programs, where site study and release characterizationis the first step in a series of actions designed to control releases.The facility will remain acceptable as long as it is in compliance withthe terms of the order or permit, and it enters into future agreementsfor further corrective action activities, when necessary, except duringperiods of administrative or judicial challenges when a facility must makethe requisite showing under 40 CFR 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Non-Subtitle C Facilities_Releases </ITAG>Environmentally significant releases of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents,or hazardous substances from any unit of a facility regulated under otherFederal laws (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act or Subtitle D of RCRA)or State laws under a Federally-delegated program, must be subject to correctiveaction mechanisms under those laws in order for the facility to be acceptableunder this proposed rule. Such releases must be evaulated by the responsibleAgency and must be determined either not to be environmentally significantor must be controlled by a corrective action program under the applicablestatute. In the event that a release is discovered that has not been addressedby corrective action, the responsible Agency may determine that the facilityis unacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes under this section. Releases from units at non-Subtitle C facilities will be considered controlledupon issuance of an order or permit under the appropriate statute containingapplicable corrective action requirements, subject again to 40 CFR 330.440(e).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Opportunity to Notify Agency of Return to Acceptability </ITAG>The Agency recognizes the need to provide an opportunity for facilitiesto notify the responsible Agency when they believe they have returned toacceptability. This is necessary because it is possible a facility mayreturn to physical compliance or complete corrective action earlier thananticipated. Facilities that believe they have returned to acceptability under 40 CFR330.440 may notify the responsible Agency in writing, explaining the measurestaken to achieve acceptability. The responsible Agency shall endeavor toreview such requests for re-evaluation in a timely manner, and shall notifythe facility in writing of its decision regarding the facility's acceptability.C. Release Criteria for Facilities Receiving Pre-SARA Wastes Under the May 1985 off-site policy, facilities with relevant conditionscould regain acceptability to receive pre-SARA wastes by entering intoan enforceable agreement under the applicable statute to correct the relevantconditions. The Agency believes this standard of action is consistent withthe intent of the off-site policy and of Congress, and is continuing itsapplication as the standard facilities with relevant conditions must meetto regain acceptability to receive pre-SARA wastes. D. Opportunities for Review of Unacceptability Determinations in Placeon November 13, 1987Under the May 1985 policy, facilities determined to be unacceptable toreceive CERCLA wastes were provided with written notice and were generallyafforded informal opportunities to comment on the determination (the latterstep was not required by the policy). Although the Agency believes thatthese steps represented adequate procedural safeguards for facilities seekingto receive CERCLA wastes, EPA decided in its November 1987 revised policyto provide an additional opportunity for review, in light of the revisedprocedures set out in that policy, for facilities with unacceptabilitydeterminations already in place on the policy's effective date (November13, 1987). EPA is repeating that offer here. Any such facility that wishes to meet with the responsible Agency to discussthe basis for a violation or release determination and its relevance tothe facility's ability to receive CERCLA wastes, may request an informalconference with or submit written comments to the responsible Agency atany point up to the 60th day after publication of the proposed rule inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>(i.e., until January 30, 1989). Such a meetingshould take place within 30 calendar days of the request. If the responsibleAgency does not find the information presented to be sufficient to supporta finding of acceptability to receive CERCLA wastes, then it will informthe facility in writing that the unacceptability determination will continueto be effective. The facility may, within 10 calendar days after hearingfrom the responsible Agency after the informal conference or the submittalof written comments, petition the EPA Regional Administrator or appropriateState official for reconsideration. The Regional Administrator or Stateofficial may use discretion in deciding whether to conduct such a review.However, review of unacceptability determinations that were already inplace on November 13, 1987, will not stay the effect of the unacceptabilitydeterminations during the period of review. A stay would potentially allowthe transfer of CERCLA cleanup wastes to facilities where the Agency hasmade detailed findings of violations or releases; this would be contraryto the Agency's mission to protect human health and the environment. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Manifest Requirements</ITAG>Any off-site transfer of CERCLA waste that is also RCRA hazardous wastemust comply with the RCRA manifest requirements in 40 CFR Part 262. EPA,or the party undertaking the on-site activity, is considered to be the``generator'' and must ensure the proper filing of the Uniform HazardousWaste Manifest.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisProposed regulations must be classified as major or minor to satisfy therulemaking protocol established by Executive Order 12291. According toExecutive Order 12291, major rules are regulations that are likely to resultin:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because it will not result in any of the impactsidentified above. Today's proposal codifies an Agency policy that has beenin effect since May of 1985 and largely mirrors a revision of that policythat has been in effect since November of 1987. This proposal containscriteria that EPA will use to determine where it will send waste from Superfundcleanups. The proposal does not regulate or otherwise impose any new requirementson commercial waste handlers. It does require them to be in compliancewith applicable regulations the Agency already enforces. As a result ofthis proposal some facilities may choose to initiate corrective actionsooner than if they waited for the corrective action conditions in theirfinal operating permit. However, regardless of the requirements of thisrule, under the authority of section 3008(h) of RCRA, EPA already compelscorrective action at RCRA interim status facilities with known or suspectedreleases. The proposal, then, should not result in increased long-termcosts to the commercial waste handling industry.The requirement to send CERCLA waste only to facilitate acceptable underthis rule may, in some cases, increase the transportation costs at Superfundcleanups conducted by EPA, the States and responsible parties under enforcementorders. This cost increase could result from decisions to ship waste agreater distance in order to reach an acceptable facility. The Agency hasconsidered the distribution of commercial facilities which have historicallyhandled CERCLA waste and their current acceptability status and has identifieda fairly even distribution of acceptable facilities across the country,with the exception of the Rocky Mountain and Northern Plain States. Theseareas, however, have a sparse distribution of commercial facilities regardlessof status. As a result, EPA has concluded that the requirement to use onlyfacilities acceptable under the proposal will not result in increases intransportation costs to EPA, States, or responsible parties conductingSuperfund cleanups that exceed $100 million annually. In addition, EPAbelieves that the majority of the facilities suitable for storage, treatmentor disposal of CERCLA waste are either currently acceptable or are scheduledfor corrective action to address releases (which will make them acceptable)through a HSWA permit or order under RCRA section 3008(h) authority.Similarly, codification of the existing policy through this rule shouldnot cause major increases in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries or geographic regions. The increased cost to the Federal governmentof waste transportation at Superfund cleanups as discussed previously,is not believed to be major. State and local government expenditures inSuperfund cleanups are fixed at a constant proportion of the total costof cleanup and should not be increased significantly by the proposal.Codification of the Agency's off-site policy through this rule should notresult in less business to the commercial waste handling industry sinceEPA believes it will not generally affect the decision to store, treator dispose of Superfund waste off-site. For this reason the Agency believesthe proposal will cause no significant adverse effects on employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises. The proposal should not createsignificant adverse effects on competition since CERCLA waste constitutesan insignificant portion of the tonnage handled by the U.S. commercialwaste handling industry. In any event, the industry is characterized bya small number of large companies which operate most of the major facilitiesthat historically have handled CERCLA waste. Information collected by theAgency on the number of acceptable and unacceptable facilities indicatesa relatively equal distribution of acceptable facilities among the majoroperators.On the benefits side, the Agency believes the existing off-site policyand its codification through this rule will provide significant environmentalbenefits through the incentive to the commercial waste management industryto remain in compliance with applicable regulations and to address environmentalreleases sooner than might normally be required by the Agency during thepermit issuance process. Most importantly, EPA believes that responsibleselection of commercial storage, treatment and disposal facilities now,may avoid the need for future Superfund cleanups of facilities being usedto dispose of today's wastes.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., at the timean Agency publishes any proposed or final rule, it must prepare a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities,unless the Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Today's proposed ruledescribes procedures for determining the acceptability of a facility foroff-site management of CERCLA wastes. It does not impose any additionalrequirements on or affect the compliance burdens of the regulated community.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 601b, I certify that this regulation willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 300</ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: November 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

Criminal violations which resultin indictment are also relevant violations. A determination of acceptabilitywill be based on compliance (i.e., absence of relevant violations) withthe following requirements:(A) Applicable subsections of sections 3004 and 3005 of RCRA or, whereapplicable, other Federal laws (such as the Toxic Substances Control Actand Subtitle D of RCRA); and(B) Applicable sections of State environmental laws.(C) In addition, land disposal units at RCRA Subtitle C facilities receivingRCRA hazardous waste from response actions authorized or funded under CERCLAmust be in compliance with applicable RCRA section 3004(o) minimum technologyrequirements. Exceptions may be made only if the unit has been granteda waiver from these requirements.(2) <T3>Releases.</T3> (i) Release is defined in andSection; 300.6 of this Part.Releases under this section do not include <T3>de minimis </T3>releases, or releases permitted under Federal programsor under Federal programs delegated to the States (Federally permittedreleases are defined in andSection; 300.6), except to the extent that suchreleases are found to pose a threat to human health and the environment.(ii) Releases from units at a facility designated for off-site transferof CERCLA waste resulting from post-SARA decision documents must be addressedas follows:(A) <T3>Receiving units at RCRA Subtitle C facilities. </T3>CERCLA wastes resultingfrom post-SARA decision documents may be transferred to an off-site unitregulated under Subtitle C of RCRA, including a facility regulated underthe permit-by-rule provisions of 40 CFR 270.60(a), (b) or (c), only ifthat unit is not releasing any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent,or hazardous substance into the ground water, surface water, soil or air.(B) <T3>Other units at RCRA Subtitle C land disposal facilities.</T3> CERCLAwastes resulting from post-SARA decision documents may not be transferredto a RCRA Subtitle C land disposal facility where a non-receiving unitis releasing any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substanceinto the ground water, surface water, soil, or air unless that releaseis addressed by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under SubtitleC of RCRA or other applicable Federal or State authority. For purposesof this section, a RCRA ``land disposal facility'' is any RCRA facilityat which a land disposal unit is located, regardless of whether a landdisposal unit is the receiving unit.(C) <T3>Other units at RCRA Subtitle C treatment, storage, and permit-by-rulefacilities.</T3> For RCRA Subtitle C treatment, storage and permit-by-rulefacilities, releases of any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, orhazardous substance from non-receiving units at facilities receiving CERCLAwastes resulting from post-SARA decision documents must be evaluated todetermine if they pose a significant threat to public health or the environment.The facility should not be used if the responsible Agency determines thatsuch a threat exists unless that release is addressed by an enforceableagreement for corrective action under Subtitle C of RCRA or other applicableFederal or State authority.(D) <T3>All other facilities. </T3> CERCLA wastes resulting from a post-SARAdecision document should not be transferred to any unit at a non-SubtitleC facility if the responsible Agency has information indicating that anenvironmentally significant release of hazardous substances has occurredat that facility. However, the facility may be used if the responsibleAgency determines that the release is addressed by an enforceable agreementfor corrective action under an applicable Federal or State authority.(iii) Releases are not considered to be ``controlled'' or ``addressed''for the purpose of this section during the pendency of administrative orjudicial challenges to corrective action programs, unless the facilityhas made the requisite showing under andSection; 300.440(e).(3) <T3>Relevant conditions.</T3> CERCLA wastes resulting from pre-SARA decisiondocuments shall not be transferred to an off-site facility if there areenvironmental conditions at the facility that pose a significant threatto public health, welfare, or the environment, or affect the satisfactoryoperation of the facility.(c) <T3>Basis for determining acceptability. </T3>(1) In order to determinecompliance status, a facility must have received an appropriate facilitycompliance inspection within six months prior to receiving the CERCLA waste.For non-Subtitle C facilities, and for all facilities receiving wastesfrom pre-SARA actions, this inspection should also serve to determine ifthere are any environmentally significant releases or relevant conditions.(2) In order to assess the status of releases at facilities being consideredto receive wastes resulting from post-SARA decision documents, RCRA SubtitleC facilities should have undergone a RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) oran equivalent facility-wide investigation before receiving waste; wherea determination of release has already been made, the facility must beunder a corrective action program which includes a facility-wide investigationbefore it may receive CERCLA waste. In addition, RCRA Subtitle C land disposalfacilities must have received a comprehensive ground-water monitoring evaluation(CME) or operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) inspection within the yearpreceding the determination of acceptability.(d) <T3>Determination of unacceptability.</T3> (1) Upon initial determinationby the responsible Agency that a facility being considered for the off-sitetransfer of any CERCLA waste does not meet the criteria for acceptabilitystated in andSection; 300.440(b), the responsible Agency shall notify theowner/operator of such facility of its unacceptability status. The noticewill be sent by certified and first-class mail, return receipt requested.The certified notice, if not acknowledged by the return receipt card, shouldbe considered to have been received by the addressee if properly sent byregular mail to the last address known to the responsible Agency. (2) The notice shall: state that based on available information from anRFA, inspection, or other data sources, the facility has been found notto meet the requirements of andSection; 300.440; cite the specific acts,omissions, or conditions which form the basis of these findings; and informthe owner/operator of the procedural recourse available under this regulation.(3) The facility may continue to receive CERCLA waste for 60 calendar daysafter the date of issuance of the notice. (4) If the owner or operator of the facility in question submits a writtenrequest for an informal conference with the responsible Agency within 10calendar days from the issuance of the notice, the responsible Agency shallprovide the opportunity for such conference no later than 30 calendar daysafter the date of the notice, if possible, to discuss the basis for theunderlying violation or release determination, and its relevance to thefacility's acceptability to receive CERCLA cleanup wastes. If unacceptabilityis based on an inspection or enforcement action taken by the State, inthe case where EPA issues the notice, a representative of the State maybe present at the meeting. If no State representative is present, EPA shallnotify the State of the outcome of the conference. An owner/operator maysubmit written comments by the 30th day after issuance of the notice, inaddition to or instead of requesting an informal conference. (5) If the owner or operator neither requests an informal conference norsubmits written comments, on the 60th day after the notice is issued, thefacility immediately becomes unacceptable to receive CERCLA waste. Thefacility will remain unacceptable until such time as the responsible Agencynotifies the owner or operator otherwise. (6) If an informal conference is held or written comments are received,the responsible Agency will notify the owner/operator in writing whetheror not the information provided is sufficient to support a determinationof acceptability. Unless information provided by the owner/operator issufficient to support a determination of acceptability, the facility becomesunacceptable on the 60th calendar day after issuance of the original noticeof unacceptability.(7) Within 10 days of hearing from the responsible Agency after the informalconference or the submittal of written comments, the owner/operator mayrequest a reconsideration of the unacceptability determination by the EPARegional Administrator or appropriate State official. Reconsideration maybe by review of the record, by conference, or by other means deemed appropriateby the reviewing official; reconsideration does not automatically staythe determination beyond the 60-day period. The owner/operator will receivenotice in writing of the decision of the RA or State official. (8) The responsible Agency may decide to extend the 60-day period if itrequires more time to review a submission. The responsible Agency shallnotify the facility owner/operator in writing if it extends the 60 days.(9) The responsible Agency may decide that a facility's unacceptabilityis immediately effective in extraordinary situations such as, but not limitedto, emergencies at the facility or egregious violations. The responsibleAgency shall notify the facility owner/operator of its immediate unacceptability.(e) <T3>Unacceptability during administrative and judicial challenges of correctiveaction decisions.</T3> For a facility with releases that are subject toa corrective action permit, order, or decree, an administrative or judicialchallenge to the corrective action (or to a permit modification callingfor additional corrective action) shall not be considered to be part ofa corrective action ``program'' controlling those releases and shall notact to stay a determination of unacceptability under this rule. However,such facility may remain acceptable to receive CERCLA waste during thependency of the appeal or litigation if: (1) It satisfies the responsible Agency that adequate interim correctiveaction measures will continue at the facility; or (2) It demonstrates to the responsible Agency the absence of a need totake corrective action during the short-term, interim period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Either demonstration may be made during the 60-day review period inthe context of the informal conference and RA/State official reconsideration.(f) <T3>Re-evaluating unacceptability.</T3> If, after notification of unacceptabilityand the opportunity to confer as described in andSection; 300.440(d), thefacility remains unacceptable, the facility can regain acceptability. Afacility found to be unacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes based on relevantviolations, releases, or relevant conditions may regain acceptability ifthe following conditions are met: (1) <T3>Judgment on the merits.</T3> The facility has prevailed on the meritsin an administrative or judicial challenge to the finding of noncomplianceor uncontrolled releases upon which the unacceptability determination wasbased. (2) <T3>Relevant violations.</T3> The facility has demonstrated to the responsibleAgency its return to physical compliance for the relevant violations citedin the notice. (3) <T3>Releases.</T3> (i) All releases from receiving units at RCRA SubtitleC facilities have been eliminated and prior contamination from such releasesis controlled by a corrective action program approved under Subtitle Cof RCRA. (ii) All releases from other units at RCRA Subtitle C land disposal facilitiesare controlled by a corrective action program approved under Subtitle Cof RCRA. (iii) A RCRA Subtitle C corrective action program may be incorporated intoa permit, order, or decree, including the following: a corrective actionorder under RCRA section 3008(h) or section 7003, a RCRA permit under 40CFR 264.100 or 264.101, or a permit under an equivalent authority in aState authorized for corrective action under RCRA section 3004(u). Releaseswill be deemed controlled upon issuance of the order, permit, or decreewhich initiates and requires completion of one or more of the following:a RCRA Facility Investigation, a RCRA Corrective Measures Study, and/orCorrective Measures Implementation. The release remains controlled as longas the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, andenters into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional correctiveaction measures when necessary, except during periods of administrativeor judicial challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration underandSection; 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable. (iv) All releases from other units at RCRA Subtitle C treatment and storagefacilities must either be deemed by the responsible Agency not to posea significant threat, or be controlled by a corrective action program asdescribed in andSection; 300.440(f)(3)(iii). (v) Facilities with releases regulated under other applicable Federal laws,or State laws under a Federally-delegated program may regain acceptabilityunder this section if the releases are deemed by the responsible Agencynot to pose a significant threat to human health or the environment, orif the facility enters into an enforceable agreement under those laws toconduct corrective action activities to control releases.(4) <T3>Relevant conditions.</T3> Facilities with relevant conditions thatare receiving CERCLA wastes resulting from pre-SARA decision documentsmay regain acceptability under this section by entering into an enforceableagreement to correct the conditions under the applicable statute. (5) An unacceptable facility may be reconsidered for acceptability wheneverthe responsible Agency finds that the facility fulfills the criteria statedin andSection; 300.440(b). Upon such a finding, the responsible Agency shallnotify the facility in writing.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-27324 Filed 11-28-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
