An anonymous caller claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad,which holds Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland,threatened to kill one of them in revenge for Sunday's attack.   _Iranian divers searched the Persian Gulf for bodies from theAirbus A300 that was destroyed by a U.S. Navy missile. The bodiesof more than half the 290 people reported aboard were recovered.   _ A team of Navy investigators left for the gulf to beginreconstructing the incident. The Navy says the Airbus was mistakenfor an Iranian F-14 jet fighter.   _ Capt. Will C. Rogers III, commander of the Vincennes, told hissuperiors he had followed proper procedures and would make the samedecisions in the same situation again.      IN IRAN   _ Iranian leaders demanded revenge and threatened war. Scenes ofprotest demonstrations appeared on television, and mass funeralswere scheduled.   ``We must all be prepared for a real war and go to the warfronts and fight against America and its lackeys. I donate myworthless life for the sake of our victory,'' said AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini.   _ Mehdi Ahary Mostafavi, Iran's ambassador to West Germany,pledged today, ``We will not let this act go unanswered. We willgive a direct and clear response.'' He said retaliation will notoccur on American soil.      THE ADMINISTRATION   _ President Reagan scoffed at Iranian claims that the Navydeliberately fired at a civilian jetliner, held fast to his policyof defending the right of free navigation and said U.S. ships willstay in the Persian Gulf.      CONGRESS   _ Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said ``the policy of trying toprotect commercial shipping in the Gulf is absolutely right.''   _ U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in London thatPresident Reagan should be more apologetic for the incident andthat Congress would favor compensating Iran for the tragedy.   _ Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the administration shouldreview its Gulf policy because the next time a tragedy occurs,American lives may be lost.      CANDIDATES   _ Vice President George Bush, virtually certain to take theRepublican nomination for president, expressed his regrets but saidthe incident should not change U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.   _ The Democrats' probable nominee, Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis, urged Iran to reconsider its threats to avenge the Iranianjetliner.   _ Democratic contender Jesse Jackson urged Reagan to offerreparations to the families of victims of the downed jet.      AROUND THE WORLD   _ In Montreal, Iran asked the International Civil AviationOrganization to immediately begin an investigation, but officialsof the U.N. agency said they need more information, particularlyfrom the United States, first.   Most governments appeared to view the incident as the kind oftragedy made virtually inevitable by eight years of war betweenIran and Iraq.   _ In London, American flags were removed from a terminal atLondon's Heathrow Airport for U.S. flights. Prime Minister MargaretThatcher's government expressed sorrow but said it understood thereasons, but some lawmakers deplored the deadly attack.   _ Moscow radio said the U.S. Navy committed ``deliberate massmurder,'' but a Soviet official said his nation would not emulatethe ``wild'' American criticism that followed the Soviet Union'sdowning of a Korean Air Lines jet.   _ Arab nations renewed their call for an end to the conflictthat has turned the entire waterway into a war zone.   _ Greece put the onus on the United States, but Washington'sallies in Europe generally used the occasion to call for an end tothe Iran-Iraq war.   _ Japan Air Lines and Cathay Pacific Airways announced routechanges on flights around the Persian Gulf to avoid trouble.      UNANSWERED QUESTIONS   _ How could the Vincennes mistake a large civilian plane, theAirbus, for a small, highly maneuverable jet fighter like the F-14?   _ Was the Iranian plane inside or outside a recognizedcommercial air corridor?   _ Was the airplane descending from 9,000 feet in what seemed tobe an attack, as the Navy says, or climbing from 7,500 feet aftertakeoff, as Iran says?   _ Did the plane have a working transponder that would haveidentified it as civilian?   _ Why did the plane ignore warnings broadcast by the Vincennes?</TEXT></DOC>
