Theuse of CADD/CAE-generated survey maps has increased both the accuracyof survey data and the capability to perform analyses with these data.In addition, health physics technician man hours and radiation exposurecan be reduced in situations where the CADD/CAE-generated drawings areused for survey mapping.</TEXT></DOC>
