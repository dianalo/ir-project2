The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that thefield testing of these genetically engineered cotton plants will not presenta risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest and will not haveany significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based uponthis finding of no significant impact, the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that an environmental impact statement need notbe prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Quentin B.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).The Mansanto Agricultural Company, of St. Louis, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment, to fieldtest genetically engineered cotton plants modified to express 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, which is not inhibited by glyphosate.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the cotton plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by the Monsanto Agricultural Company, as wellas a review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene from <T3>Petunia hybrida</T3> encoding a modified 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphatesynthase, which is not inhibited by glyphosate, has been inserted intoa cotton chromosome. In nature, chromosomal genetic material of floweringplants is transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to another plantby cross-pollination because the field pest plot is located at a sufficientdistant from any sexually compatible plant with the which these experimentalcotton plants might cross-pollinate.2. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene itself,nor its gene product, confers on cotton any plant pest characteristic.Traits that lead to weediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannotbe conferred by adding a single gene.3. The plant species (<T3>Petunia hybrida</T3>) from which the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphatesynthase gene was isolated is not a plant pest. 4. The 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene does not providethe transferred cotton plants with any measurable selective advantage overnontransformed cotton in their ability to be disseminated or to becomeestablished in the environment.5. The vector used to transfer the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphatesynthase gene to cotton plants has been evaluated for its use in this specificexperiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. Thevector, although derived from a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential,has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicityhave been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shownto be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.6. The vector agent, <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens,</T3> a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthasegene into cotton plant cells. The vector agent has been known to be eliminatedand no longer associated with any transformed cotton plant.7. Horizontal movement of the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthasegene is not possible. The vector does not survive in or on any transformedcotton plant. No mechanism of horizontal movement is known to exist innature to move an inserted gene from a chromosome of a transformed plantto any other organism.8. Glyphosate is the active, ingredient of the herbicide RoundupR. RoundupRis a broad spectrum postmergence herbicide which is rapidly degraded inthe environment and has low toxicity to orgamisms other than plants andmicro-organisms.9. The field test site is small and will be no greater than 0.5 acre. Theenvironmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have beenprepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Actof 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 6th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
