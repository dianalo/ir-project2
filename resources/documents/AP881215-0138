Gen. Prosper Avril to powerthree months ago have been discharged for insubordination, an armyofficial said Thursday.   ``We cannot let anarchy reign over the armed forces of Haiti,''Col. Joseph L. Florestant, secretary general of the military staff,told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.   In another development, the Salesian Roman Catholic order said inRome that it has expelled a Haitian activist priest it accused ofinstigating violence and exalting class warfare. The Rev. JeanBertrand Aristide was the apparent target of a September attack on achurch that killed 13 people.   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said Thursday that over the weekendseveral soldiers were discharged in the southern town of Les Cayes,nine each from garrisons in the northern towns of St. Marc andGonaives and four in the southwestern town of Aquin.   The station said all the ousted soldiers supported the Sept. 17coup against former leader Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and the nationwidepurge of unpopular officers that followed it.   Florestant said the soldiers were not discharged because of theirsupport for the September mutiny but because of theirinsubordination after the coup.   ``We cannot accept that orders come from the bottom of thehierarchy,'' Florestant said. ``If an enlisted man had been stirredup and no longer wants to obey orders thinking he has become apolitical figure, he may be sanctioned in conformity with theregulations of the army.''   Florestant, who was himself appointed to his post after the coup,said the discharge orders were issued by regional commanders and notthe army high command in Port-au-Prince.   Soldiers said they ousted Namphy because they were disgusted bystate-sponsored violence. They ousted nearly 60 officers accused ofbeing repressive and linked to the former Duvalier familydictatorship.   Their demands included a return to democratic rule, respect forhuman rights and better living conditions for Haiti's 7,000-man army.   Namphy came to power after former President Jean-Claude Duvalierfled to exile in France in February 1986, ending 29 years of famlydictatorship.   Aristide, 35, has led calls for uprooting the vestiges of theDuvalier regime. In September, he was escaped during a bloody attackon his church in Port-au-Prince during a Sunday Mass by thugs linkedto the ousted regime. Thirteen people were killed and more than 70were wounded.   A communique issued in Rome by the Salesian Society of St. JohnBosco said Aristide had rebuffed repeated attempts to correct hisbehavior, which they described as ``in contrast with his Salesianand priestly vocation.''   ``The type of political commitment he has assumed is in seriouscontrast with the clear will of the founder (of the order),'' thestatement said.   ``In addition, the incitement to hate and violence, theexaltation of class struggle, go directly against that fidelity tothe (teaching) of the church that forms a living part of theSalesian spirit.''   Aristide has been at odds with superiors of his Salesian order inRome for some time. He was ordered to leave his homeland and go toCanada by Oct. 17, but he defied the order and remains in Haiti.   The order's spokesman, the Rev. Giuseppe Costa, said the decree,ratified by the Vatican last week, did not change Aristide's statusas a priest.</TEXT></DOC>
