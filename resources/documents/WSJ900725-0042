The American Arbitration Association says it was called into help with 401 such disputes last year, more than fivetimes the 73 cases in 1981.   New York City accounted for nearly a fourth of the total,with 98 cases filed last year. Los Angeles followed with 45and Orange County, Calif., with 30.   Robert Coulson, the group's president, attributes the risein the caseload to growth in franchising generally andfranchisers' increased use of contracts that requireout-of-court resolution of conflicts. He predicts the volumewill keep rising as the service economy grows and certaintypes of franchises reach market saturation. These includefast food, printing and auto repair.   Disputes in the franchise industry typically involve suchissues as contract termination, unpaid fees and territorialrights. Franchisers often prefer arbitration to open-courtairing of disputes, for privacy reasons.   But arbitration has disadvantages for franchisees, saysSan Francisco lawyer Patrick Carter. For instance, he notesthat franchising contracts often require arbitration hearingsto be held in the franchiser's hometown. That means, he says,out-of-town franchisees may be hard pressed to afford thetrip to make a case.                                                                                                          Entrepreneurs Benefit   From U.S. Privatization                                                                                                          ENTREPRENEURS have been big winners in the federalgovernment's privatization campaign.   A recent study for the U.S. Small Business Administrationshows that 70%, or 552, of the federal contracts awarded inprivatizing efforts from 1985 to 1987 went to smallcompanies. However, they got just 42% of the $1.7 billiondollar amount awarded.   &quot;Small businesses were very aggressive in bidding on thesecontracts,&quot; says Raymond Marchakitus, an economist with theSBA's Office of Advocacy. The study shows that smallbusinesses could, in fact, beat not only the federalgovernment's costs of doing the work itself but also biggercompanies' bids, he says. To win the contracts, companiesmust be able to provide a product or service for at least 10%less than what it would cost the government.   The study, performed for the SBA by Research DimensionsInc., Alexandria, Va., also indicates that the governmentsaved at least $189.1 million by contracting to small firmsin the period.   The SBA is studying how small business participates inprivatizing programs on state and local levels. The studyshould be completed by the end of summer.   One beneficiary of the federal campaign: E C Corp. of OakRidge, Tenn., a supplier of repair, maintenance and otherservices to the military, which achieves most of its annual$17 million of sales through business the government startedcontracting out. E C completed contracts for hospital upkeepat Fort Stewart, Ga., and janitorial work at the MerchantMarine Academy in New York.   The chief drawback? Red tape. &quot;The government has theright ideas about cutting costs&quot; through privatization, saysMichael Randolph, director of E C's services division. Butthe bureaucracy makes it &quot;so difficult&quot; to do the work, headds. He says some contractors have become so frustrated thatthey are shying away from government business.                                                                                                          Small High-Tech Firms   Hiring at a Rapid Pace                                                                                                          EMPLOYMENT at small high-tech businesses is growing at amuch faster rate than among businesses generally.   While national employment rose 1% in the past 12 months,employment at small technology companies increased 6%, saysCorporate Technology Information Services Inc., a Woburn,Mass., business-data publisher. The firm annually surveysover 30,000 technology firms, including 18,000 with fewerthan 1,000 employees each. In the past 12 months, a total of22,498 jobs were created at the high-tech firms surveyed, thecompany said.   Small makers of computers and computer systems increasedtheir work force by more than 7%, the survey says. Meanwhile,employment at some of the country's biggest computer makerscontinued to shrink, it says.   &quot;Smaller computer systems,&quot; made mostly by smaller firms,&quot;are growing at the expense of larger systems,&quot; says RichardShaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.   The most rapid growth among the technology companies camefrom software makers. The 1,500 computer software companiesin the survey grew at over 10% and added more than 8,000employees in the past 12 months.   &quot;Software is becoming increasingly important (for allcompanies) -- from running businesses to designing products,&quot;says Lou Mazzucchelli, a co-founder of Cadre TechnologiesInc., a software concern with offices in Providence, R.I.,and Beaverton, Ore. Cadre, whose revenue rose nearly 150% to$50 million last year, increased its staff 30% to 230.   Demand for new computers and other high-tech products willcontinue to fuel rapid employment growth in high-tech firms,Corporate Technology predicts.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          UNIVERSITIES aren't tapped for help by small firms asoften as by large businesses, says a recent University ofNorth Carolina study. One reason: Small companies simplyaren't as aware of ways a university can aid them in areassuch as research, production and computer systems. . . .Seat-of-the-pants: About a third of 2,500 entrepreneursrecently surveyed run their companies without a financialplan, says Mid-Atlantic Cos., a New York financialconsultant.</TEXT></DOC>
