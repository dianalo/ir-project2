<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-1097 </DOCNO><TEXT>Laser-induced emission from the visible wavelength f-f transitions ofEu{sup 3+} is used to determine the number of distinct europium ion sitesand their site symmetries in powdered monoclinic and body-centered cubic(bcc) Eu{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Identical studies are also carried out for ahigher surface area catalytic bcc Eu{sub 2}O{sub 3} material. For themonoclinic sample, the f-f emission spectrum is found to result fromthree distinct europium sites, all of which possess C/sub s/ symmetry.Individual emission lines are assigned to the separate emitting sitesfor the {sup 5}D{sub 0} {yields} {sup 7}F/sub J/ series for J = 0, 1,and 2. Emission spectra from the regular and higher surface area bccEu{sub 2}O{sub 3} materials are found to originate from two distinctEu{sup 3+} sites in the oxide lattice. The strongest emitting Eu{sup3+} site is assigned to the known C{sub 2} symmetry site of the bcc lattice.No emission was observed from the known S{sub 6} symmetry site. The secondand weaker emitting site, which is observed in the spectra of both theregular and higher surface are materials, is determined to result froman Eu{sup 3+} site with either C{sub 2} or C{sub 1} symmetry.</TEXT></DOC>
