Under the accord, which is subject to the signing of adefinitive agreement and other conditions, Computer Scienceswill provide General Dynamic's aerospace and defense unitswith data center management, network operations and othertechnical services including systems analysis. The agreementmarks one of the biggest commercial information technologyservices contracts ever awarded, and would catapult ComputerSciences into the league of industry heavyweights such asArthur Andersen andamp; Co., General Motors Corp.'s EDS Group, andInternational Business Machines Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Computer Sciences will pay General Dynamics about $200million for facilities, equipment, software and services,including three data-processing centers in Norwich, Conn.,Fort Worth, Texas, and San Diego, Calif., and 28 servicesites around the country. Those assets would give ComputerSciences the additional capacity to attract other commercialcustomers, including defense subcontractors, financialservices, insurance and health-care organizations, companyofficials said.   About 2,600 General Dynamics employees in its data systemsdivision -- nearly 76% of the unit's workers -- will transferto Computer Sciences. However, analysts said they expect somestaff reductions as the two operations merge. A ComputerSciences spokesman said the company hoped to make any staffreductions through attrition, and a General Dynamicsspokesman said all its employees would be offered comparablejobs under the shift.   Van Honeycutt, the Computer Sciences vice president whowill oversee the new operations, said roughly 75% of thefinancing for the acquisition will come from a bank creditline that should be completed within a week or two, with thebalance coming from cash on hand and internally generatedfunds.   William R. Hoover, Computer Sciences chairman andpresident, said he expects the transaction to be completed byNov. 1, and said the agreement will generate about $350million in revenue in the first full year of operation. Forthe fiscal year ended March 29, Computer Sciences reportednet income of $65 million, or $4.02 a share, on revenue of$1.74 billion.   A General Dynamics spokesman said the move is part of theaerospace and defense concern's plan to slim down anddiversify under its new chairman, William Anders. &quot;Thatbusiness isn't what General Dynamics does for a living,&quot; saidspokesman Ray Lewis.   The announcement boosted Computer Sciences' stock, whichwas quoted at $62.50, up $2.50, in late trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange. General Dynamics' stock was quoted at$41.75, up 87.5 cents.   The contract would shift Computer Science's business mixfrom 70% government contracts and 30% commercial business toabout 50-50, a goal that Computer Services set four years agowhen it targeted commercial contracts for growth. Analystsapplauded the contract both for its size and the potentialfor attracting different customers, although some raisedquestions about the Computer Sciences' ability to maintainoperating margins as it integrates the business into its ownoperations.   &quot;This will more than double their internal capacitydedicated to the commercial market,&quot; said Cato D. Carpenter,an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons. General Dynamics' ownsubcontractors would be a likely source of new business, headded, as would general manufacturers and others.</TEXT></DOC>
