While Japanese, Chinese and AmericanIndians marry outside their race at rates between 40 percent and 70 percent,less than 2 percent of blacks marry out. This startling statistic underscoresthe still rigid barriers between blacks and whites, and how rapidly otherpopulations are integrating and melding new permutations.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LOVE'S NO FANTASY FOR INTERRACIAL PAIRS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  T.T. Nhu's column appears each Friday on the Feature Page.  </MEMO><TEXT>     San Francisco writer Joan Walsh sparked a controversy last year when shewrote a magazine article about the interracial pairing of Asian women andCaucasian men. Dozens of people called me up to get my reaction, since I amalso a statistic in this configuration. The gist of the article was thatEuropean-American men are drawn to the &quot;Asian women fantasy&quot; and this syndromewas a new name for these men's inability to have intimate relationships withwomen as equals, i.e., white women. Asian women were made to appear as rivals,yet dismissed for their inherent inferiority.;   I was seriously misquoted byAsian Week when I told a reporter that the outrage against Asian women&quot;stealing&quot; men was misplaced. &quot;Asian women are getting a bad rap,&quot; I told her.&quot;This being the Bay Area, the reason why there aren't enough men to go aroundsimply has more to do with the fact that many of the available men areinterested in other men.&quot; She reduced this to: &quot;Asian men aren't interested inAsian women; most Asian men are gay.&quot; Ouch! That's what I get for talking to ajournalist.;   Married for nearly 20 years to a WASP, I know something aboutinterracial marriage. When I first met my husband, however, I thought he wasJewish. He was tall, dark, handsome and funny. Yes, yes, I'm deeplysuperficial. Marrying a Jew (if I were to marry at all) was not such a foreignnotion because I had grown up in New York City, and all of my friends at thetime were Jewish. In fact, marrying a non-Jew would have been more alien.Living on the upper West Side, I was often puzzled by my mother's desire thatI marry a &quot;nice Vietnamese boy.&quot; And where, pray, was I to meet one inManhattan in 1965?;   I found my husband refreshing because he didn't have&quot;yellow fever&quot; -- didn't have the faintest idea what it was. He'd never evendated an Asian woman. I had met a fair amount of American men who could neversee beyond the Suzy Wong fantasy of exotic Asian women. It was ridiculous tobe treated like a frivolous object. Perhaps that's why I developed a sometimesprickly persona to fend off unwanted attention.;   Many of our friends areinterracial couples, although none of us notices it anymore. The children fromthese unions look remarkably alike. They all look vaguely Peruvian or MiddleEastern. They are often mistaken for cousins or siblings, and in a way, theyare members of the same tribe.;   Walsh's trendy article annoyed me because itoverlooked the possibility that interracial couples could be nothing more thantwo people who love each other. No one I know got married to make a politicalstatement. In the end, skin color isn't what determines the success or failureof a relationship. It's two people struggling to make a life together, forbetter or for worse.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  T.T.
