For a second day, the army barred the 1.5 million Palestiniansin the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel toprevent disturbances. It also barred journalists from most of theterritories, where curfews were maintained over 23 refugee campsand towns for a fifth day. All told, more than 400,000 Arabs wereliving under curfew.   In a special Independence Day interview, Prime Minister YitzhakShamir said nearly five months of anti-occupation violence appearedto be winding down and called on Arab activists to stop the rioting.   Shamir told Israel radio that Palestinian leaders' heads were``in the clouds. Their demands have reached the skies.''   According to U.N. figures, 169 Arabs have died since theuprising began 19 weeks ago in the territories Israel seized in the1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis also have been killed.   Despite the unrest, Israelis marked the holiday with picnics,hikes through the countryside and visits to army bases speciallyopened to the public.   In Jerusalem, President Chaim Herzog held a reception forveterans of the 1948 war in which Israel won its independence.   The 24-hour Independence Day festivities were launched onWednesday night with a torch-lighting ceremony at Jerusalem's MountHerzl.   Hundreds of thousands of Israelis then took to the streets tosing, dance and watch fireworks. In keeping with tradition, youthsknocked passers-by over the head with plastic hammers and sprayedthem with a dry foam.   One of the highlights was a military show at Ramat Gan Stadiumnear Tel Aviv featuring parachute jumps, fighter jets, tanks andfireworks. It was the first display of armaments since 1973. Israelhas tended to refrain from such exhibits to avoid emphasizing therole of wars in its history.   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the West Bank today, including 16soldiers outside the Dheishe refugee camp on Bethlehem's outskirts.Israelis were warned to be on the alert for suspicious objectsduring the holiday.   Most Palestinians stayed off the job, observing a general strikecall from the Palestine Liberation Organization and undergroundleaders.   They had also been asked to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiersand in Bethlehem, Palestinians hurled a gasoline bomb at an Israelipatrol.   Troops responded with rubber bullets, breaking all the windowsin one home, according to an AP reporter at the scene. The soldiersalso fired live rounds into the air and lobbed tear gas canisters.   On Wednesday, underground leaders issued leaflet No. 14, whichcalled on Palestinians to mark last week's assassination of PLOmilitary commander Khalil Wazir with strikes and demonstrations.   Tunisian authorities and Israeli sources say he was killed byIsraeli commandos. The Israeli government refused comment.   The killing caused violent protests on Saturday during whichIsraeli soldiers shot and killed 17 Palestinians, the highest deathtoll for a single day since the uprising began.   Another Palestinian was shot to death Wednesday and 10 woundedin protests that defied curfews in effect since Saturday.   Leaflet No. 14 bore a picture of Wazir and contained a pledge tohim to ``follow your path until the flag to which you dedicatedyour life will be raised over Jerusalem, the capital of ourindependent Palestinian state.''   It also called for a general strike on April 28 to protest thedeportation of Palestinian activists. Since Dec. 8, Israel hasexpelled 20 alleged Palestinian agitators to Lebanon.   On Wednesday, the army established a new prison for Arabdetainees north of Jerusalem to help incarcerate the 5,000Palestinians arrested since the uprising began.   If was the fifth new Israeli prison established since theuprising began, according to the Palestinian human rights group Lawin the Service of Man.</TEXT></DOC>
