In a finding that promises to accelerate development ofrevolutionary diamond-coated products, scientists atNorthwestern University said they've discovered a way to moreeasily crystallize thin films of diamond. The techniqueemploys spherical carbon molecules called buckyballs -- stufffound in soot -- to help generate the diamond films.</LP><TEXT>   The advance could make it easier to put tough diamondcoatings on tools, eyeglasses, razor blades, watch faces,ball bearings and a host of other products, greatly extendingtheir useful life. It also could help researchers make largesingle crystals of diamond -- a prerequisite to developingfaster, smaller computers based on diamond semiconductors.   In a report last year, the U.S. National Research Councilsaid new diamond-coating techniques are some of the mostimportant technology advances of the past decade and &quot;maywell outstrip&quot; new superconductors in economic importance.But the techniques employ a crystallizing process calledchemical vapor deposition, or CVD, which requires thesurfaces to be coated with diamond grit and is difficult touse with curved or irregular surfaces. Using buckyballs asmolecular seeds for growing diamond films, engineers shouldbe able to dispense with the diamond-grit treatment, easilycoat curved surfaces and more cheaply cover large surfaceswith diamond, said R.P.H. Chang, who led the Northwesternteam.   If confirmed, the method would be &quot;a very importantachievement&quot; said John Angus, a prominent diamond-filmresearcher at Case Western Reserve University. The findingalso may shed light on how diamond crystallizes during theCVD process, which is little understood at the molecularlevel. That may someday enable scientists to control theprocess well enough to synthesize large, gem-like diamondscheaper than they can be mined -- a longstanding dream indiamond research.   The finding also may lead to the first major commercialuse of buckyballs, tiny balls of pure carbon formally calledbuckminsterfullerenes because they resemble the geodesicdomes of architect Buckminster Fuller. In the past year,scientists have peppered technical journals with startlingdiscoveries on buckyballs' properties and have dreamed upmany possible uses for them, from lubricants to rocket fuel.The Northwestern University discovery, expected to bereported in detail next month in the journal Applied PhysicsLetters, suggests buckyball payoffs may come faster thanexpected.   The Northwestern team's diamond recipe is based on abuckyball variant with 70 carbon atoms. After placing a thinlayer of the balls on a silicon surface, the scientistsblasted them with electrically charged particles -- a stepthat apparently rips open the tops of the balls to formmolecular structures conducive to diamond formation. UsingCVD methods, the scientists then passed a mixture of naturalgas and hydrogen over the frayed buckyballs. The balls act asseed crystals, allowing many tiny diamonds to form from thecarbon in the natural gas.   Using a variation on this theme, researchers may be ableto form diamond film resembling a large, single crystal foruse in electronic applications, Dr. Chang added.   Diamond films are expected to have huge markets becausethe material holds records for hardness and ability toconduct heat, and it is highly corrosion-resistant. Diamondfilms also potentially can be made into semiconductors neededfor computer chips that work at very high temperatures,enabling them to be packed in denser arrays than in currentcomputers. Diamond-coated products are beginning to reach themarket for a few special applications, such as high-pricedaudio speakers and devices to carry heat away from lasercomponents. Recently, sunglasses with scratch-resistant filmsof &quot;diamond-like&quot; material -- crystals chemically similar todiamonds but easier to make and less tough than the realthing -- have been testmarketed in the U.S., said JimRussell, editor of Diamond Depositions Science andTechnology, a newsletter based in Somerset, N.J.   In a separate discovery, researchers at Japan's NEC Corp.reported last month at a scientific conference in Richmond,Va., that they had discovered a tubular form of buckyballs.The new &quot;buckytubes' -- long cylindrical meshes of carbonatoms capped by domes resembling buckyballs cut in half --may be the strongest fibers ever made, according to anarticle on the conference to appear in next month's issue ofScientific American. Besides promising super-strong newmaterials, the buckytubes may be able to spontaneously rejoinif broken -- a kind of &quot;self-healing,&quot; said Richard Smalley,a Rice University buckyball researcher. Researchers alreadyare spinning theories about the tubes, including predictionsthat they will conduct electricity, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
