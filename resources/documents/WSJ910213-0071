A star at this year's show, the International Solid StateCircuits Conference, will be a super-fast version of IntelCorp.'s 80486 microprocessor, the chip used as the &quot;brains&quot;of some of today's fastest personal computers. Intel says itsnew version runs at 100 megahertz, three times faster thanthe fastest 80486 on the market.</LP><TEXT>   Intel claims that the zippy new 486 is the world's fastestmicroprocessor and that the technological breakthroughsembodied in it will help the company create by the year 2000a chip that operates at a blistering 250 megahertz and thatcontains 100 million transistors. Today's Intel chipscontain, at most, 1.2 million transistors.   PC users shouldn't rush to the computer store for a100-megahertz computer, though. The chips at the conference,which starts today, are largely experimental and oftenreappear many months or years later as chips that are farless impressive.   &quot;This is the premier hardcore techie conference forintegrated-circuit technology,&quot; says Michael Slater, editorof the newsletter Microprocessor Report. &quot;Don't confuse anISSCC paper with a product announcement. All it means isyou've been able to fabricate one chip&quot; that may not bepractical to make or use under real-world conditions, hesaid.   Still, the chips described here are hints to what willshow up in tomorrow's PCs, televisions and Nintendo games.Companies typically use the conference, which is intended tobe a showcase of leading-edge manufacturing andcircuit-design techniques, to grab bragging rights as theproducer of the latest and greatest.   Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. plans to unveil two &quot;fastest&quot; chips.One, it says, is a &quot;high electron mobility transistor 64kilobyte static random-access memory.&quot; Translation: theworld's fastest memory chip.   Fujitsu says its chip will run four times faster thanconventional static memories, a type of memory typically usedwhere speed is more important than price, such as insupercomputers, the multimillion-dollar machines used topredict weather, model car bodies, and do scientificcalculations. But static memories are increasingly popularbecause they speed up such devices as PCs and even videotapeplayers.   The company cranks up its chip's speed using a technologythat lets electrons travel much faster through the chipscircuits than conventional chips allow.   National Semiconductor Corp. plans to show a chip that itsdeveloper says could bring video conferencing to thehousehold. The chip, National says, is the world'shighest-performance &quot;embedded microprocessor,&quot; a type of&quot;brain&quot; chip used to control equipment such as car engines,laser printers and medical equipment. National's chip,code-named &quot;Swordfish,&quot; processes 100 million instructions asecond, several times faster than the fastest embeddedcontrollers available today.   Developed at a National laboratory in Israel, the chipuses reduced-instruction-set-computing, or RISC, technologyand is unique because it also contains so-calleddigital-signal-processing circuitry. That circuitry, which isnormally built into a separate chip, will allow it to be usedin such applications as video conferencing and computers thathandle audio, video and computer data, National says.</TEXT></DOC>
