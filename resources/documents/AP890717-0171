Neues Deutschland, the official daily of East Germany's CommunistParty, called on West Germany to outlaw the party, which made strongshowings in regional elections in recent months.   ``Whoever trivializes the danger of neo-Nazis or even considersthe neo-Nazis as future partners in a coalition must reckon withbeing seen in the world as paving the way for Hitler's successor,''Neues Deutschland, said.   The Republicans, led by former Nazi SS trooper Franz Schoenhuber,concentrate on nationalist themes. They advocate stiff reductions inthe number of asylum-seekers allowed to stay in West Germany andstrict limits on foreign workers.   Schoenhuber has said his party speaks out for German interestsand supports constitutional law.   Earlier this month, West German Interior Minister WolfgangSchaeuble said membership in right-wing extremist groups last yearincreased 12.8 percent in the nation of 61 million and may havesurpassed 30,000.   The Republicans earlier this year gained seats in locallegislatures in West Berlin and Frankfurt and won six seats in theEuropean Parliament on June 18.   Most of the party's gains were at the expense of ChancellorHelmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union and itsBavarian ally, the Christian Social Union.   Kohl's Christian Democrats have expressed concern about nationalelections scheduled for December 1990 but say they rule out forminga coalition with the Republicans as a means of staying in power.   Schoenhuber, however, added to speculation about a possiblecoalition by saying at a recent party meeting ``we are in thefortunate position of being a wanted bride and not a flirtingbridegroom.''   Neues Deutschland claimed that a ``debate'' about aconservative-Republican coalition showed West Germany has not cometo terms with German's Nazi past.   ``It is clear that the ideology of Nazism, chauvinism, the racismbetween the Rhein and Elbe (rivers), North Sea and the Alps has anoticeable basis,'' the newspaper said, referring to key boundarylines in West Germany.   Schaeuble has said West German officials will meet in Septemberto determine if the Republican Party should be labeled an extremistorganization. If it should be ruled extremist the party could bekept under surveillance by the Verfassungschutz, the country's maindomestic intelligence agency.</TEXT></DOC>
