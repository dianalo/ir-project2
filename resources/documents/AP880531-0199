David Klinger, spokesman for the service, said export documentsprovided by the zoo late Friday have been reviewed and found to beacceptable.   ``The permit is acceptable to us,'' Klinger said. ``Thecondition of the law has been met. That should settle it.''   He said the zoo will be notified by letter Wednesday and thatthe panda exhibit will be allowed to continue.   However, a lawsuit is pending in which a wildlife group contendsthe pandas _ an endangered species _ are being exploited forcommercial gain.   In its federal suit against the Fish and Wildlife Service, theWorld Wildlife Fund argues that the exhibit violates aninternational convention that bars trafficking in endangeredspecies for commerical purposes.   U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson has set a hearing on thesuit for June 13.   The pandas entered the United States on May 13 accompanied by anexemption form instead of a full Chinese export permit as required.   The animals were allowed to begin their three-month exhibit lastTuesday as part of Toledo's 150th anniversary celebration, but theUSFWS gave the zoo until May 29 to provide the proper documentation. </TEXT></DOC>
