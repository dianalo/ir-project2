The two players will resume play Thursday with Timman to move.   Grandmasters analyzing the game were divided in their assessmentof the position. Ian Rogers of Australia believed Timman, playingblack, was in a better position, but Im Ligterink and GrandmasterOleg Romanishin said it was unclear.   Karpov's second believed Timman had a slight advantage after 30moves. The position was so complex that Karpov was in serious timetrouble after 51 moves.   The players had to make 40 moves each in the first two hours andanother 20 moves in an hour. Although they managed to meet the twotime controls, experts believe the players missed the best possiblecontinuations.   In the opening, the two grandmasters followed the GruenfeldDefense, which they played in the second game.   Karpov varied on move 9 by castling, instead of moving Bg5. Thiswas seen as an improvement from the second game and Timman had todefend a very difficult position.   But the Dutch grandmaster managed to equalize on move 25 when heput his pawn on e5, offering a pawn on the d-file. Karpov declined,apparently thinking it too dangerous to accept the sacrifice.   The winner of this match will move on to meet Garri Kasparov forthe world title in Lyons, France in October.   Karpov leads the series 2-1, having won the first game and drawngames 2 and 3. Karpov and Timman are to play a 12-game match. Thewinner will be the first player to reach a score of 6{ points.   For Wednesday's game 5, Timman will play white.</TEXT></DOC>
