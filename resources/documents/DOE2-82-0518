Little is known about long-termenergy production, equipment availability, and operation and maintenance(O and M) costs. The objective of this report is to present the resultsof an assessment of the available field experience to date, at a numberof wind turbine sites. The data reported cover 1986 and 1987 field experience,but insight from previous years' experience was utilized to draw conclusionsand make recommendations regarding wind turbine reliability. Operationalinformation was collected and assessed from fifteen commercial wind powerstations. The data cover twelve different wind turbine models. Resultsare presented for the current experience and some projections are madefor future large wind power stations. Energy production predictions forplanned wind power stations are imprecise, due to the as-yet unresolvedproblems associated with micrositing and array effects. However, accordingto statistics prepared by the California Energy Commission, the commercialwind power stations in California are achieved approximately 50% of theenergy production expected when the machines were installed. Althoughthere are some exceptions (i.e, some stations are meeting projections),the energy shortfall poses a serious problem for the industry. Long-termequipment availability and O and M costs are not well established, dueto insufficient historical data. The fatigue life of wind turbine structuralcomponents may be significantly shorter than expected. In cases wherefatigue failures are already evident (i.e., rotor blades, gearboxes,and yaw systems), the challenge is to improve designs and upgrade qualitycontrol procedures without substantial cost increases. 15 figs., 21 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
