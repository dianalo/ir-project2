Amongthose criticized for an overriding emphasis on the financial bottomline are some of the walk-in clinics that have sprouted around thenation, offering treatment at any hour without an appointment andearning revenues in the billions of dollars. In this first articlein a continuing series, ``The Business of Medicine,'' Science WriterDaniel Q. Haney and National Writer Fred Bayles look at allegationsthat these clinics sometimes do unnecessary tests to pile up profits.</TEXT><NOTE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</NOTE><NOTE>and</NOTE><NOTE>FRED BAYLES</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writers</NOTE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Each month, doctors at many of the nation's 4,000walk-in clinics receive report cards from their employers. Insteadof rating the quality of their care, these printouts rank the sizeof their bills.   To some health experts and doctors in the $2.5-billion-a-yearwalk-in industry, these ``productivity sheets'' are just one exampleof the lures and prods used by many storefront clinics to raiseprofits through unnecessary charges.   Doctors complain they are enticed with bonuses, inspired with peptalks, chastened with reprimands and even threatened with dismissal,all to keep them churning out lucrative but questionable X-rays,tests and prescriptions to raise patients' bills.   ``You could see people walk in with a simple head cold. Thedoctors would order a chest X-ray, sinus X-ray, a few lab tests, andpretty soon you've turned a head cold into a $150 extravaganza,''recalled Dr. Anthony G. Bruzzese of his days at a Rhode Islandclinic.   Dr. Arthur H. Herold of the University of South Florida, whoresigned from a walk-in chain, explained how some doctors try tojustify extraneous tests: ``If you can order a battery of tests anddo X-rays, patients think they've gotten good medicine _ and you'vemade more money off of them.''   Some say the often-anonymous brand of medicine practiced by theso-called ``doc-in-the-box'' clinics _ no-appointment-needed,no-medical-history-known _ leads to overuse of testing to reassurepatients and protect doctors from malpractice claims.   ``You don't get sued for taking an X-ray. You get sued for nottaking it,'' said Dr. Robert Gordon, a partner in four New Englandwalk-in clinics.   Clinic executives deny they encourage needless tests. One studybacks them up, though a medical authority says the survey didn'tcheck the right tests.   Over the past decade walk-in clinics, mostly owned by individualdoctors, small local chains or hospitals, have sprung up on MainStreets and in shopping malls across the country. Open at night andon weekends, they recorded 50 million patient visits last year,earning an estimated $2.5 billion.   ``We have all heard anecdotal stories about clinics that put thedollar sign ahead of the patient,'' said Dr. John J. Ring, chairmanof the board of the American Medical Association. ``It's verydefinitely unethical to order or charge for a test or procedure thatthe physician knows is unnecessary.''   Clinic officials say productivity sheets and other inducementssimply remind payroll doctors that medicine is a business as well asa profession.   ``People find it hard to believe that doctors work on apercentage, but that's the way it works in the emergency room andprivate practices,'' said Dr. Stephen Dickey, owner of the Doctor'sWalk-In Clinic chain in the Tampa, Fla., area.   Many doctors like walk-in medicine because they can practice theway they want. They side with Dr. Martin Iser, who works at aWeymouth, Mass., branch of Health Stop, the nation's biggest chainwith 112 clinics in Boston, Chicago, Atlanta and St. Louis.   ``I've never felt any pressure by the company to order tests thatwould be considered medically unnecessary,'' Iser said.   Nonetheless, internal documents from Health Stop demonstrate thecompany's emphasis on testing levels.   One memo from the director of operations asked nurses to helpprevent ``underutilization of ancillaries,'' meaning diagnosticprocedures. It said they should ``obtain ... the necessary lab andX-ray tests'' before the doctors see the patients. Doctors reluctantto allow this were to be reported.   Another memo, which began by noting that average revenue perpatient had dropped, urged nursing supervisors to keep patientwaiting time to a minimum, to give patients followup appointmentsand to be ``more aggressive'' assisting doctors with billings.   ``Offer suggestions regarding routine medical protocols for laband X-ray utilization at Health Stop,'' it said.   Health Stop doctors are paid about $35 an hour or 21 percent oftheir gross charges, whichever is higher. Many clinics offer doctorsa percentage of everything they bring in.   At Health Stop and Doctors Walk-In, the doctors are sent monthlycomputer printouts ranking them according to their average fees perpatient.   The monthly report ``shows that if you wanted to make more money,you could. There are definitely some doctors who order more testsbecause of it,'' said Dr. Michelle Maffeo, a Boston-area Health Stopphysician who also said she herself was never pressured.   ``There is always in the back of your mind the realization thatthe more tests you order, the more finances you can generate foryourself,'' said Dr. Andrew Garlisi of Tampa, a former DoctorsWalk-In physician. ``It wasn't the primary motivating factor, but ashuman beings it's hard to ignore.''   Dickey, owner of Doctor's Walk-In, denied the firm encouragedphysicians to run up the bill. ``I want them to treat patientsappropriately,'' he said. ``We are just trying to practice basicmedicine, to take care of sick people in a humane way.''   A productivity sheet from Doctors Walk-In showed the top-rankedphysician charged $58 per patient. The last-place doctor had averagecharges of $31. These sheets also showed how many patients thedoctors saw per hour and the total value of medicines their patientsbought at the clinic.   A Health Stop monthly report from 1987 showed the average numberof X-rays, tests and procedures per patient for each doctor. Thedoctors' total bills ranged on average from $76 to $44. The chain'saverage was $62.   The physician with the lowest charges was Dr. Thomas McGrath, oneof two Health Stop doctors who assert they were fired in 1987 fordoing too few tests and X-rays. Neither doctor had written proof ofthis.   McGrath, now a physician at the University of Connecticut studentinfirmary, said he rarely used diagnostic machines.   ``If somebody came in with a sore throat, they didn't need ablood count. They (Health Stop officials) wanted routine tests donefor routine problems,'' he said.   The other dismissed doctor was Randall S. Bock, who now operateshis own walk-in clinic in Revere, Mass. He said he resisted orderingtests when his stethoscope and a physical exam provided all theinformation he needed.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
