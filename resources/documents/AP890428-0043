(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Civil rights leaders are suing the stateof Connecticut contending its schools make it impossible for poor,minority students to get the same education as their white,suburban counterparts.   The desegregation lawsuit was filed Thursday in HartfordSuperior Court on behalf of a black Hartford fourth-grader and 16other children and teen-agers, arguing that racial imbalance inHartford area schools violates the state constitution's guaranteeagainst racial discrimination.   The lawsuit contends that black and Hispanic inner-city childrenand white suburban children are all suffering under greaterHartford's racially divided school systems.   ``Black children going to black schools and white children goingto white schools is inherently unequal,'' said Wesley Horton, oneof 10 lawyers who will argue the case. ``It's got to be stopped.''   The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, 10-year-old Milo Sheff,attends Hartford's Annie Fisher School, where 99 percent of thestudents are black or Hispanic.   Six of the 17 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are white, including twochildren from West Hartford, an affluent suburb where schools are84 percent white. In Hartford, where the other 15 plaintiffs live,schools are 91 percent black or Hispanic.   The lawsuit contends that the concentration of poor children,children from one-parent families, and non-English speakingchildren places severe burdens on the Hartford school system,making it unable to provide education comparable to that offered innearby suburbs.   The lawsuit also alleges that white children in suburban schooldistricts surrounding Hartford ``are deprived of the opportunity toassociate with, and learn from, the minority children attendingschool within the Hartford school district.''   The lawsuit does not ask for any specific remedy to desegregatethe schools, and the lawyers who will argue the case seemedhesitant to suggest one.   ``What we envision is a system whereby Puerto Ricans and blacksand whites are educated together,'' said William Olds, executivedirector of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, which isproviding two lawyers to the plaintiffs.   A court-ordered solution could focus on redrawing schooldistrict boundaries, busing students from one district to another,or creating interdistrict ``magnet'' schools.   State Education Commissioner Gerald H. Tirozzi, one of 10 stateofficials named as defendants, has proposed voluntary, incrementalsteps such as magnet schools to desegregate Connecticut schools.But the Legislature has not acted on Tirozzi's suggestions, andcivil rights leaders maintain the Legislature won't deal with theissue without pressure from the courts.   Also named as defendants are Gov. William A. O'Neill, the sixcurrent members of the state Board of Education, state TreasurerFrancisco L. Borges _ the state's highest black official _ andstate Comptroller J. Edward Caldwell.   O'Neill's legal advisor, Howard G. Rifkin, said Thursday thegovernor would have no comment on the lawsuit until he has had achance to review it.</TEXT></DOC>
