Dean Witter, the brokerage unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., settled the case by neither admitting nor denying the SEC's allegations and by agreeing to take several remedial steps. According to the SEC, Dean Witter agreed that, among other things, it would establish formal procedures to improve its supervision of branch offices and would set up a committee to review its procedures for monitoring its stockholdings.    Dean Witter declined to comment on the matter.    William Ryan, president of Continental Materials, a Chicago-based construction materials concern, welcomed the news of the SEC move. &quot;Hopefully, it'll discourage other people from doing the same thing,&quot; he said.    According to the SEC, in August 1982 a broker in the Dean Witter's Wayzata, Minn., office began buying stock in Continental Materials and encouraging his clients to follow his example. By December of that year, clients of the Wayzata office held almost 15% of the stock's float -- that is, the number of shares in the hands of the public and available for trading.    That month, Continental Materials asked Dean Witter whether it or any of its customers were aiming to take over the company, according to the SEC.    Dean Witter's compliance department then instructed the Wayzata branch manager to tell his brokers to stop soliciting purchases of Continental Materials. He did, but by April 1983, the SEC said, the office's clients had boosted their stake in the float to 19.3%. Continental Materials again contacted Dean Witter, which then issued a companywide prohibition against solicitations for the stock.    That reminder and subsequent ones were disregarded, the SEC said, in what it termed a &quot;breakdown&quot; in the firm's supervision of its employees. The Wayzata stake continued to grow, eventually reaching 24.4% of the float in February 1984, when the stock price began to drop. Continental Materials' Mr. Ryan said that much of the Wayzata position had been bought on margin, making the drop in price all the more precipitous. Margin is the amount of cash that must be put up in buying securities; the rest can be borrowed.    In August 1982, when the Wayzata broker began buying, Continental Materials shares traded at around $10. In January 1984 the stock traded in the low $30s. A month later, it closed at $16.125.    Separately, the SEC barred a former Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. broker from the securities industry. It said that Yasuhiro Nomoto, who until April of this year was a broker in the San Francisco office of the Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. unit, neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations, but agreed to the order.    According to the SEC, Mr. Nomoto was convicted earlier this year of misappropriating $500,000 in customer funds, sentenced to a five-year prison term and ordered to make restitution to his customers.    Shearson declined to comment on the action. </TEXT></DOC>
