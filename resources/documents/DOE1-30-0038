The activities performed to develop the performance evaluationmethod include study for improvement on the devices developed to conducestandard calibration of solar cells and on the components of the mainequipment for evaluating the performance of solar cell modules. Theyalso include development of standard management technology and testsof various solar cell modules for their characteristics. The activitiesperformed to develop the reliability evaluation method include exposuretests of various modules using a weather room and outdoor exposure testequipment and development of temperature-humidity cycle test equipment,salt spray test equipment, and SO{sub 2} gas atmosphere test equipmentfor the purpose of developing a weather-proofness test system. The progressof this research and development is as follows: In 1980 and 1981, a largesolar simulator was developed and utilized to study standard calibrationtechnology, standard solar cell method, experiment methods concerningthe temperature dependence, irradiance, and other characteristics ofsolar cell modules. In 1982, a weather room, outdoor exposure test equipment,and meteorological element measurement equipment were developed.</TEXT></DOC>
