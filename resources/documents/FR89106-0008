On December 24, 1987, the Commission published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of proposed rulemaking requesting commentson its proposed rules to implement the Debt Collection Act of 1982 andsection 2653(a)(1) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (52 FR 48725).The only comments received in this proceeding were filed by NorthwesternIndiana Telephone Company (NITCO).NITCO suggested that the proposed rules be clarified to indicate that,with respect to the collection of monetary forfeitures imposed by the Commission,the proposed debt collection procedures will be invoked only after thejudicial review proceedings prescribed in sections 503 and 504 of the CommunicationsAct have become final.2. The <T3>Report and Order </T3>clarifies that the Commission must adhere tothe statutory procedures for forfeitures in the Communications Act beforeinvoking debt collection procedures under the adopted rules. While it isclear that the Debt Collection Act was designed for the collection of monetaryforfeitures, the related uniform standards issued by the Department ofJustice and the General Accounting Office prescribe that laws and regulationsthat are specifically applicable to claims collection activities of a particularagency take precedence over the procedures set forth by the Debt CollectionAct. Thus, because sections 503 and 504 of the Communications Act delineatespecific procedures for the collection of forfeitures imposed by the Commission,those procedures must be followed before considering other procedures adoptedin this proceeding. Proposed rule 1.1905 has been clarified in order toaddress this matter.3. The final rules adopted herein have been analyzed pursuant to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). In this connection, we find thatthe rules prescribe no new modified forms to be submitted by the public.4. Accordingly, it is ordered that the Rules and Regulations of the FederalCommunications Commission are amended in the manner indicated attachedto this Order. These rules will become effective February 6, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

In determining the timing of demandletters, the Commission will give due regard to the need to act promptlyso that, as a general rule, if it becomes necessary to refer the debt tothe Department of Justice for litigation, such referral can be made withinone year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amountof the debt. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example,to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring),written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under thischapter, including immediate referral for litigation.(b) The initial demand letter will inform the debtor of: (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to requestreview within the agency; (2) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrativecosts (andSection;andSection;1.1940 and 1.1941 of this subpart) and; (3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should notbe more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailedor hand-delivered. (c) As appropriate to the circumstances, the Commission may include eitherin the initial demand letter or in subsequent letters, matters relatingto alternative methods of payment, policies with respect to use of consumerreporting agencies and collection services, the agency's intentions withrespect to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation,and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the debtor's entitlementto consideration of waiver. (d) The Commission will respond promptly to communications from the debtor,within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute thedebt that they must furnish available evidence to support their contentions.(e) If, either prior to the initiation of, at any time during, or aftercompletion of the demand cycle, the Commission determines to pursue administrativeoffset, then the procedures specified in andSection;andSection;1.1912 and 1.1913as applicable, will be followed. The availability of funds for offset andthe agency's determination to pursue that remedy, release the agency fromthe necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) ofthis section. If the agency has not already sent the first demand letter,the agency's written notification of its intent to offset must give thedebtor the opportunity to make voluntary payment, a requirement which willbe satisfied by compliance with the notice requirements of andSection;andSection;1.1912and 1.1913 as applicable. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1.1912 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Collection by administrative offset. </ITAG>(a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken in accordancewith these regulations on all claims which are liquidated or certain inamount, in every instance in which such collection is determined to befeasible and not otherwise prohibited. (1) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determinationto be made by the agency on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of sounddiscretion. The Commission will consider not only whether administrativeoffset can be accomplished practically, but also whether offset is bestsuited to further and protect all of the Government's interest. In appropriatecircumstances, the Commission may give due consideration to the debtor'sfinancial condition and is not required to use offset in every instancein which there is an available source of funds. The Commission may alsoconsider whether offset would tend to substantially interfere with or defeatthe purposes of the program authorizing the payments against which offsetis contemplated. For example, under a grant program in which payments aremade in advance of the grantee's performance, offset will normally be inappropriate.This concept generally does not apply, however, where payment is in theform of reimbursement. (b) Before the offset is made, a debtor shall be provided with the following:Written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and the agency's intentionto collect by offset; opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertainingto the debt; opportunity to obtain review within the agency of the determinationof indebtedness; and opportunity to enter into a written agreement withthe agency to repay the debt. (1) The Commission will exercise sound judgment in determining whetherto accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination willweigh the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairnessto the debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputedits existence or amount, the Commission will normally accept a repaymentagreeement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish thatoffset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equityand good conscience. (2) In cases where the procedural requirements specified in paragraph (b)of this section have previously been provided to the debtor in connectionwith the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority,such as pursuant to a notice of audit disallowance or pursuant to 47 U.S.C.503, 504 and 47 CFR 1.80, the agency is not required to duplicate thoserequirements before taking administrative offset. (3) The Commission may not initiate administrative offset to collect adebt under 31 U.S.C. 3716 more than 10 years after the Government's rightto collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government'sright to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably havebeen known by the official or officials of the Government who were chargedwith the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. When the debtfirst accrued is to be determined according to existing law regarding theaccrual of debts, such as under 28 U.S.C. 2415. (4) The Commission is not authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 to use administrativeoffset with respect to: (i) Debts owed by any State or local Government; (ii) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act,the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States;or (iii) Any case in which collection of the claim or type of claim by administrativeoffset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. (5) The Commission may effect administrative offset against a payment tobe made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraph(b) of this section if: (i) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Government'sability to collect the debt, and (ii) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permitthe completion of those procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such prior offset must be promptly followed by the completion of thoseprocedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owedto the Government shall be promptly refunded.   (6) The Commission will obtain credit reports on delinquent accounts toidentify opportunities for administrative offset of amounts due to a delinquentdebtor when other collection techniques have been unsuccessful.(c) Type of hearing or review. (1) For purposes of this section, wheneverthe Commission is required to provide a hearing or review within the agency,it shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearingwhen:(i) Any applicable statute authorizes or requires the agency to considerwaiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of theindebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibilityor veracity; or (ii) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the agency determinesthat the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of thedocumentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turnson an issue of credibility or veracity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this sectionis not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, although the Commissionwill carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.(2) The section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collectionsystems in which determinations of indebtedness or waiver rarely involveissues of credibility or veracity and the agency has determined that reviewof the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct priormistakes. In administering such a system, the agency is not required tosift through all of the requests received in order to accord oral hearingsin those few cases which may involve issues of credibility or veracity.(3) In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section,the agency will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsiderationbased upon a ``paper hearing,'' that is, a review of the written record.(d) Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other agenciesin affecting collection by administrative offset. Generally, the Commissionwill not refuse to comply with requests from other agencies to initiateadministrative offset to collect debts owed to the United States unlessthe requesting agency has not complied with the applicable provisions ofthese standards or the offset otherwise contrary to law.(e) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor againstthe United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.(f) Whenever the creditor agency is not the agency which is responsiblefor making the payment against which administrative offset is sought, thelatter agency shall not initiate the requested offset until it has beenprovided by the creditor agency with an appropriate written certificationthat the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and full compliancewith the provisions of this section has taken place.(g) When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, the Commissionwill apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with thebest interest of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstancesof the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutesof limitation.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1.1913</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirementand Disability Fund.</ITAG>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Commission may request thatmoneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirementand Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts inorder to collect in one full payment, or a minimal number of payments,debts owned to the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall bemade to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Managementin accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Directorof that Office.(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a)of this section, the Commission shall include written certification that:(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of thedebt;(2) The Commission has complied with the applicable statutes, regulationsand procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and(3) The Commission has complied with the requirements of andSection; 1.1912of this subpart, including any required hearing or review.(c) Once the Commission decides to request administrative offset underparagraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practicalafter completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Officeof Personnel Management may identify and ``flag'' the debtor's accountin anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligibleto receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement thatoffset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, ifat least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made,the debtor should be permitted to offer a satisfactory payment plan inlieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances wouldrender the offset unjust.(d) If the Commission collects part or all of the debt by other means beforedeductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section,it shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset underparagraph (a) of this section.(e) This section does not require or authorize the Office of PersonnelManagement to review the merits of the Commission's determination withrespect to the amount and validity of the debt, its determination as towaiver under an applicable statute, or its determination to provide ornot provide an oral hearing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.1914 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Collection in installments.</ITAG>(a) Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, debts owedto the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrativecosts as required by this subpart should be collected in full in one lumpsum. This is true whether the debt is being collected by administrativeoffset or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if thedebtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, paymentmay be accepted in regular installments. The Commission will obtain financialstatements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay the debtin one lump sum. If the Commission agrees to accept payment in regularinstallments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement fromthe debtor which specifies all of the terms of the agreement and whichcontains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults.The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonablerelation to the size of the debtor and debtor's ability to pay.
