In the present paper,new experimental results on the RISU yield are presented with specialemphasis on its flux dependence. In the main parameter range investigated(5 keV Ar/sup +/, 1800 K, 5x10/sup 16/ to 3x10/sup 19/ Ar/sup +/ m/sup-2/ s/sup -1/) the yield is about 5 and appears to be independent ofthe ion flux. Simple models based on the assumption that the RISU yieldis controlled by the internal sink density for interstitials predicta correlation between flux dependence, temperature dependence and absolutevalues of the yield which is not confirmed by our experimental data.Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. It is concludedthat the RISU yields to be considered for fusion reactor conditions (10/sup22/ to 10/sup 23/ ions m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/) are comparable with thoseobserved under present ion beam conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
