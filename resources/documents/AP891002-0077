The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals courtruling in a Maryland case that no such right to sue exists.   Charles Milburn Jr., now 20, was not quite 2 years old when in1971 the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services placedhim with foster parents Karl and Wendy Tucker of Glen Burnie.   His parents voluntarily had placed him in the custody of thesocial services agency.   Milburn's federal lawsuit against the Tuckers, individual socialworkers and the county agency said he was subjected to physicalabuse for nearly two years before being removed from the Tuckers'home.   The suit, which sought $66 million in damages, said his injuriesincluded two leg fractures, a facial laceration and severe burnsthat left his hands permanently scarred and disabled.   The suit alleged that Mrs. Tucker, with her husband's knowledge,inflicted all the injuries _ including her immersing theyoungster's hands in boiling water.   Milburn's suit, based on alleged violations of hisconstitutional due-process rights, was thrown out by U.S. DistrictJudge Joseph C. Howard, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsupheld the dismissal last March 31.   Such lawsuits must establish that the alleged harm was caused bythe government or some government agent. The 4th Circuit ruled thatthe Tuckers did not fit the definition of government agents.   ``The state of Maryland was not responsible for ... the(alleged) physical child abuse itself,'' the appeals court said.``It exercised no coercive power over the Tuckers; neither did itencourage them.''   The appeals court noted that a parallel lawsuit filed in statecourt, alleging Maryland tort law violations, is awaiting action.   The Supreme Court last February ruled that public officials maynot be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligencepermits a child to be abused by a parent.   That decision in a Wisconsin case said a state does not have aconstitutional duty to protect people, including abused children,who are not in the state's custody.   Writing for the court then, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquistsaid, ``As a general matter, we conclude that a state's failure toprotect an individual against private violence simply does notconstitute a violation of the (Constitution's) due process clause.''   That constitutional provision bars deprivation of life, libertyand property without due process of law.   A footnote in the February decision, however, said the justiceswere leaving undecided whether due-process considerations wouldarise in the case of children abused by foster parents.   The case is Milburn vs. Anne Arundel County Department of SocialServices, 89-96.</TEXT></DOC>
