Hundreds of schools were closed by snow or high water in 10states and travelers were snowbound in airports and in towns alonghighways.   The weather was blamed for at least 12 deaths, including oneperson killed by what the National Weather Service said was highwind in Georgia on Sunday when thunderstorms battered the Southeast.   It also was blamed for millions of dollars in losses for poultryfarmers in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, where birds were killedwhen the weight of snow collapsed their buildings.   Snow in Pennsylvania forced President Bush to cancel a trip toLancaster County on Tuesday, where he had planned to visit schoolsto talk about drugs and meet with Amish and Mennonite leaders in thearea.   The widespread precipitation was caused by moist air welling upfrom the Gulf of Mexico and sliding over cold air from the north,the National Weather Service said.   In that mass of icy air, record lows Monday included Fort Worth,Texas, 20; Galveston, Texas, 27; Grand Island, Neb., 10 below zero;Huron, S.D., 17 below zero; Lake Charles, La., 25; Shreveport, La.,24; and Wichita Falls, Texas, 8.   The heaviest snowfall was in Oklahoma, where 16 inches fell inthe Pauls Valley area south of Oklahoma City. Pauls Valley PoliceChief Robert Nichols said the snow had ``drifted halfway up thedoor,'' and drifts up to 6 feet high were reported on some roadsaround the state.   Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow. Weather Servicemeteorologist John Feldt said the 11 inches in the St. Louis areawas the third heaviest accumulation for 24 hours in March sincerecord-keeping began in 1874.   The Missouri State Senate and House canceled Monday's and Tuesdaymorning's sessions.   Northern Arkansas got up to a foot of snow, collapsing some roofsand causing millions of dollars in damage to poultry houses. InBentonville, part of the roof of an unoccupied kindergarten centercollapsed and a bowling alley was destroyed.   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., asked federal officials to helpArkansas poultry farmers and others who suffered damage from thestorm. Pryor said Hudson Foods of Rogers suffered more than $15million in losses, including the loss of more than 150 breederfacilities, broiler farms and turkey farms.   Up to 11 inches fell over the weekend in northern Texas and partof a fire station roof collapsed at Bowie, 70 miles northwest ofFort Worth, where wind piled the snow into drifts up to 7 feet high.   Central Illinois got up to 10 inches of snow and lesser amountsextended eastward through Ohio into Pennsylvania, New Jersey and NewYork state.   Schools were closed Monday in parts of Arkansas, Indiana,Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio. Somejunior colleges closed in Illinois, where most public schools wereclosed by a state holiday.   Icy pavement and blowing snow made travel nearly impossible inmany areas.   In Ardmore, Okla., 328 travelers spent the night in the NationalGuard Armory and the civic auditorium, said Civil Defense DirectorJames Mercer. About 75 people took refuge at a church in Davis insouthern Oklahoma.   ``I've got a lobby full of people wanting rooms, and I'm full andit's blowing like crazy,'' said Mary Martin of the Green CountryMotel in Sallisaw, Okla. ``They can't hold their trucks and vehicleson the highway.''   All the motel rooms in Mount Vernon, Mo., were filled whilemotorists waited out the storm along Interstate 44, west ofSpringfield, according to the Lawrence County Sheriff's Department.   Officials at Lambert Airport in St. Louis said air traffic hadnearly come to a halt. Trans World Airlines, which accounts for morethan 85 percent of Lambert's traffic, said all departing flightswere canceled Monday. TWA said some arriving flights made it in butran late.   Tulsa (Okla.) International Airport closed every 20 minutes soplows could clear the main runway, said operations coordinator RogerBlickensderfer.   Rain caused flooding that forced the evacuation of more than 300people in Tennessee, including 200 Girl Scouts moved from their campin Cheatham County, said County Executive Vernon Knight.   The rain also pushed streams out of their banks across southernWest Virginia, closing roads in 14 counties, canceling school inseveral counties and forcing some evacuations, state and localofficials said. Flash flood were reported around the state andseveral rivers in the northern part of the state were expected tocrest above flood stage during the night.   All four lanes of Interstate 79 were closed by high water at JaneLew, W.Va., between Weston and Clarksburg, said state HighwaysDepartment spokeswoman Carol Melling. She said the department'sdistrict headquarters in the area also was evacuated.   In Calhoun County in western West Virginia, classes were closedearly but school buses were unable to complete their routes,stranding about 100 students at Minora Elementary School and 22 atArnoldsburg Elementary School. ``It's been a mess,'' said Minoraprincipal John Queen.
