By British standards, the sentences given to ErnestSaunders, 55 years old, and two of his co-defendants wereunusually stiff and signaled tougher policing of London'sfinancial community, legal specialists said. The trial judge,Justice Sir Denis Henry, said the sentence sends &quot;a clearmessage that those who seek commercial advantage by actingdishonestly can expect little leniency from the court.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The sentencing of Mr. Saunders and the two others closed achapter in the longest-running British financial scandal ofthe 1980s. The case, with its three-year investigation and113-day trial, helped prompt new laws to regulate practicesin British boardrooms and brokerage houses.   Mr. Saunders' crime, according to the verdict Monday,occurred during the British spirits company's #2.53 billion($4.92 billion) takeover in 1986 of Scottish rival DistillersCo. To win the takeover battle, Mr. Saunders allegedlyconspired to inflate his company's stock price. Prosecutorssaid he authorized payments to three co-defendants, one ofwhom bought #25 million worth of Guinness stock. Supportingthe stock's price was important to Guinness's takeovervictory because the value of its offer for Distillers wastied to the price of Guinness's shares.   During yesterday's sentencing, one of the defendants,Anthony Parnes, a 45-year-old stockbroker, collapsed. But helater returned to the dock to hear himself sentenced to 2 1/2years in prison and ordered to pay #440,000 in court costs.   Prosecutors said Mr. Parnes had received #3.4 million in&quot;success&quot; fees from Guinness for his help in thestock-support scheme. He has already repaid about #2 millionto Guinness.   A third defendant, Gerald Ronson, 50, chairman of HeronInternational PLC, was sentenced to one year in prison, fined#5 million and ordered to pay #440,000 in court costs.   Companies controlled by Mr. Ronson, the jury found,received #5.8 million for help in supporting Guinness stock.But after the scandal broke Mr. Ronson repaid most of themoney.   A fourth defendant, financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, isscheduled to be sentenced Sept. 25. Sir Jack, the jury found,illegally received a #3 million fee for his help in thetakeover battle. A second trial is expected to begin thisautumn of Mr. Saunders and three other defendants on othercharges arising from the Guinness affair.   In London's financial district, one brokerage housechairman, who declined to be named, called the penalties&quot;very severe&quot; and said they represent &quot;a dramatic change of{police} tactics in the City.&quot; Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman ofthe Stock Exchange, called the case &quot;a salutary and highlyvisible warning of the innate risks in activity of thiskind.&quot; But he added that he doesn't think the Guinnessdefendants' conduct &quot;is or ever was widespread&quot; in the City.   Justice Henry, on the other hand, called the crimes anoutgrowth of the competitive, aggressive atmosphere of theBritish mergers and acquisitions game during the 1980s bullmarket. He called Mr. Saunders &quot;at the center of thedishonest conduct that occurred&quot; at Guinness. While Mr.Saunders didn't invent the illegal stock-support scheme, thejudge said, it couldn't have occurred without his &quot;knowledgeand approval.&quot;   &quot;When men are hell-bent for victory, greed is in thesaddle, and ordinary probity and the law are thrust aside,&quot;the judge said.   Mr. Saunders, who says he is impoverished and on legalaid, stood silently as the judge passed sentence. Mr.Saunders' defense had been that the payments he authorized tohis co-defendants were normal business expenses during atakeover. His son says he will appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
