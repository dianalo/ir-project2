The diversified high-technology concern said net jumped to $11.8 million, or 54 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $298.7 million from $252.4 million.    While most of the company's businesses participated in the upturn, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Varian said the higher earnings are largely attributable to its semiconductor equipment group. The group, which makes machines used by chip makers to produce integrated circuits, is benefiting from &quot;a combination of much stronger market conditions, new product offerings and better operating efficiency,&quot; according to the company. </TEXT></DOC>
