Federal Election Commission records show Keiser made a total of$95,750 in campaign contributions last year -- almost four times the federallimit. There is no record that he was ever asked by the commission to explainhis actions. Efforts to reach Keiser for comment were unsuccessful.;   Not allthe contributors whose names appear in Federal Election Commission files ashaving given more than $25,000 would necessarily be found guilty of violatingelections laws. Some of them are likely to be victims of reporting errors andother commonplace glitches in the complex campaign finance disclosure system.;  But critics contend that by failing to investigate any such cases, thecommission is sending a signal to rich campaign contributors that there is noreason to worry about violating the law.;   &quot;The fact that the FEC refuses toact in these cases is a disservice to the system,&quot; said Ellen Miller,executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a think tank devotedto campaign finance reform. &quot;It means there is no deterrent at all.&quot;;   FECCommissioner Joan Aikens, asked why violators of the $25,000 limit are almostnever brought to justice, said her agency, which has a budget of nearly $19million for this fiscal year, does not have enough people to monitorcontributions by individuals.;   &quot;There are parts of the law that we considermore serious,&quot; Aikens said. &quot;We have to focus our resources on the violationsof the law that we consider more egregious.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910915  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  374  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 15, 199100259157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
