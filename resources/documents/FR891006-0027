Turner, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The reef fish fishery of the Gulf ofMexico is managed under the FMP prepared by the Gulf of Mexico FisheryManagement Council (Council), and its implementing regulations at 50 CFRpart 641, under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation andManagement Act (Magnuson Act).Amendment 1 is a major revision of the FMP which, to the extent allowedby available data, addresses snappers, groupers, and other reef fish ona species basis. This change from the FMP's approach of addressing snappersand groupers as a single mixed species complex was made possible by anexpanded reef fish data collection effort by NMFS and the states in recentyears. Stock assessment analyses based on these data indicate red snapperare severely overfished and other species require reductions in fishingmortality to assure that the spawning stock biomass is maintained at alevel adequate to prevent reductions in recruitment to those species orstocks. As a consequence of these analyses, Amendment 1 and these proposedimplementing regulations would reduce fishing mortality largely by imposingmeasures such as bag limits, quotas, size limits, and gear restrictions.They also provide a procedure for setting TAC annually based on stock assessmentsand for adjusting the measures imposed to achieve TAC.Three minority reports object to (1) the prohibition of the retention andsale of undersized fish in certain instances; (2) the bag limits beingapplied to shrimp vessels; (3) the geographical extension of stressed areas;(4) the maximum number of persons aboard charter and headboats to fishcommercially; (5) the commercial quota on groupers; (6) the prohibitionof entangling nets; or (7) the 20-inch minimum size limit for red grouper.A notice of availability summarizing Amendment 1 and the minority reportswas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 29, 1989 (54 FR 35707).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In 1984, NMFS implemented, cooperatively with the States, a Trip InterviewProgram (TIP) which collected length-frequency and other biological andstatistical information on landings of reef fish by species. Collectionof landings data for groupers by species instead of by family was alsoinitiated. These data sets along with similar information collected underthe Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), initiated in1979 and available by 1984, surveys of Gulf charter and headboat fisheries,and fishery independent information from the Southeast Area Monitoringand Assessment Program provided a data base that allowed stock assessmentsto be undertaken for major reef fish species.The stock assessments for red snapper and other species were initiatedby the Southeast Fisheries Center (SEFC) of NMFS in 1986 and were completedby SEFC and the Council in 1988. The stock assessments for red snapperconcluded that the fishery was being subjected to recruitment overfishingand that the SSBR was likely no greater than 4.8 percent of the unfishedlevel. This analysis and those for the dominant groupers indicated thatto restore the spawning stocks to a 20 percent SSBR level, reductions infishing mortality on the order of 60 to 70 percent would be necessary overthe long-term (i.e., until the year 2000) for red snapper and on the orderof 20 percent over the short-term for the groupers. Size limits, bag limits,and other reductions in harvest levels necessary to restore each speciesor species group to the 20 percent SSBR (i.e., the Council's goal for long-termOY from the fishery) and the supporting analyses are set forth in Amendment1.<ITAG tagnum="84">Problems in the Fishery</ITAG>Problems affecting the fishery that resulted in the development of Amendment1 by the Council are as follows:1. The adult population of red snapper has declined since 1979, and thisdecline may be greater in the western Gulf. The current snapper fisheryis supported primarily by younger fish, ages one to three;2. Habitat loss is negatively affecting reef fish stocks in the Gulf ofMexico;3. Longline gear has been introduced in the fishery since the FMP was written;this gear needs to be recognized as a segment of the fishery. If longlinesare used in areas where other gear have been used traditionally, an increasein the level of mortality and conflicts among user groups may result;4. The geographic extent of and limitation on fishing effort within thestressed area require modification to address fishing mortality and userconflicts under current and potential use patterns;5. Some reef fish species are growth and recruitment overfished;6. Management measures specified in the FMP to establish a data base formanagement have not been implemented successfully. Statistical data formany species have been aggregated into genus or family groups which hasmade it impossible to assess the condition of specific stocks adequately.Biological profile data are needed throughout the Gulf of Mexico on a continuingbasis; the present system of opportunistic dockside sampling of the commercialcatch is not providing a representative characterization;7. A significant portion of the catch in the reef fish fishery consistsof species not included in the fishery management unit;8. Present definition of OY for the reef fish fishery is an overestimateand does not provide adequate protection for the resource due to differentvulnerabilities among reef fish species to overfishing;9. Mortality of juvenile red snapper due to trawl bycatch reduces potentialyield;10. Fishing pressure has increased dramatically in the past decade dueto increased number of vessels, greater use of sophisticated electronicequipment, and increased use of more efficient gear by all sectors of thefishery;11. Definitive research is needed to determine whether artificial reefscontribute more to overfishing or to the rebuilding of the reef fish resourcein the various Gulf of Mexico habitats;12. The user groups utilizing and depending on the reef fish resourcesneed to be identified and their socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristicsdelineated to enable analysis of their respective impacts on the resourceand the differential impacts that alternative management measures may exerton the various user groups;13. The stock boundaries of reef fish are unknown; and14. Overfishing of the reef fish stocks is the result of directed and nondirectedrecreational and commercial fishing mortality.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Objectives</ITAG>The management objectives of Amendment 1 are:1. To stabilize long-term population levels of all reef fish species byestablishing a certain survival rate of biomass into the stock at spawningage to achieve at least 20 percent SSBR (the primary objective);2. To reduce user conflicts and nearshore fishing mortality;3. To respecify the reporting requirements necessary to establish a database for monitoring the reef fish fishery and evaluating management actions;4. To revise the definitions of the fishery management unit and fisheryto reflect the current species composition of the reef fish fishery;5. To revise the definition of OY to allow specification at the specieslevel;6. To encourage research on the effects of artificial reefs; and7. To maximize net economic benefits from the reef fish fishery.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Unit</ITAG>Presently, snappers, groupers, and seabasses are managed under the FMP.Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulation would add the tilefishes,amberjacks, white grunt, red porgy, and gray triggerfish to the managementunit. These species previously taken as incidental catch and frequentlydiscarded are now being targeted in the fishery.<ITAG tagnum="84">Optimum Yield</ITAG>Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations state OY as two components.The first is OY as a long-term goal, and the second is an annual specificationof TAC for each species (stock) or species group (stock complex) that isdesigned to achieve the OY over time. The components are designed to bringthe FMP into compliance with the provisions of 50 CFR part 602 in orderto prevent overfishing or rebuild an overfished stock.The statement of OY as a long-term goal contained in Amendment 1 is: ``OptimumYield is any harvest level for each species which maintains, or is expectedto maintain, over time[,] a survival rate of biomass into the stock ofspawning age to achieve at least a 20 percent Spawning Stock Biomass PerRecruit (SSBR) population level, relative to the SSBR that would occurwith no fishing''. The target date for achieving OY, as specified in theTAC procedure, is on or before January 1, 2000. The target date was selectedin part to moderate the short-term impacts of the harvest restrictionsrequired to achieve OY on users of the reef fish resources, particularlyfor red snapper. The procedure for specifying an annual TAC contains provisionsthat are designed to assure the goal will be met, provides safeguards toprevent irreversible overfishing, and will allow the rules to be modifiedannually based on the most recent information and analyses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of Overfishing</ITAG>Overfishing is defined as:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. A reef fish stock or stock complex is <T3>overfished </T3>when it is below the level of 20 percent of the [SSBR]that would occur in the absence of fishing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. When a reef fish stock or stock complex is overfished, <T3>overfishing </T3>is defined as harvesting at a rate that is not consistentwith a program that has been established to rebuild the stock or stockcomplex to the 20 percent [SSBR] level.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. When a reef fish stock or stock complex is not overfished, <T3>overfishing</T3> is defined as a harvesting rate that [,] if continued[,] would lead to a state of the stock or stock complex that would notat least allow a harvest of OY on a continuing basis.</ITAG>The SSBR (reproductive potential) is determined by integrating or summingthe multiple, for each age, or relative number of fish alive times theestimated fraction mature times the estimated weight of fish. The two modelsused to determine SSBR, both variants of yield per recruit models, arethe Boverton-Holt continuous model and the Ricker discrete model. The totalcontribution of a cohort to the spawning stock biomass over its lifetimeis found by summing the cohort's contribution at each age, which is thenscaled to a per recruit basis to derive the theorethical SSBR measure.The SSBR measure can be used to evaluate alternative fishing mortalityscenarios without knowing actual levels of recruitment or spawning stock.Maximum SSBR is obtained by setting fishing mortality to zero.In the Council's opinion, these definitions satisfy the 50 CFR part 602Guidelines in that they have sufficient scientific merit; are likely toresult in effective Council action to prevent the stock from closely approachingor reaching an overfished status; provide a basis for objective measurementof the status of the stock against the definition; and are operationallyfeasible.<ITAG tagnum="85">Procedure for Establishing an Annual TAC and Adjusting ManagementMeasures (Procedure) </ITAG>The Procedure provides for the Science and Research Director of SEC toprepare or update the stock assessment for each species (stock) or stockcomplex annually (i.e., prepare a Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation(SAFE) Report) as provided for in 50 CFR part 602. The Council would berequired to appoint a scientific stock assessment panel (Panel) to reviewthe SAFE Report and other relevant information and prepare a report (Report)specifying a range of acceptance biological catch (ABC) for each stockor stock complex. The ABCs would be calculated so as to achieve reef fishpopulation levels at or above the 20 percent SSBR goal by January 1, 2000.The Panel would be required to include in the Report to the Council a riskanalysis of probabilities of each level of an ABC attaining OY, economicand social impacts of the levels, and recommendations for management measuresto attain the ABC. The Council, after holding a public hearing(s) and reviewingcomments of the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) and of the ReefFish Advisory Panel (AP) of the Report, would be required to specify aTAC from within or below the range of ABC or a series of TACs (some ofwhich may be higher than the ABC) to attain the selected level of ABC innot less than three years. It was judged that such gradual approach toreduction of fishing mortality may be less disruptive to the fishery andhave less adverse impact on users. The Procedure provides the safeguardsto assure that irreversible overfishing does not occur, and that furtheradjustments to management measures will restore depleted stocks withina specified time frame and be based on progressively mroe precise and accurateinformation.The Council would be required to subdivide the TACs into commercial andrecreational allocations which maximize the net benefits of the fishingto the nation and are based on percentages harvested by each sector duringthe period of 1979-87. If the harvest in any year exceeds the TAC becauseeither the recreational or commercial user group exceeds its allocation,subsequent allocations to the exceeding group will be adjusted to assuremeeting the January 1, 2000, spawning stock biomass goal. The Council would be required to provide to the NMFS Regional Director(RD) its recommendations for TACs for each species or species group, proposedregulations revising quotas and management measures necessary to attaineach TAC, the Council's rationale, and analyses of impacts (EA and RIR)of the proposed regulations. A proposed rule containing the recommendedTACs, quotas, and harvest restrictions will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for public comment. If the RD concludes afterreview of public comment that the proposed regulations are consistent withthe FMP objectives and other applicable law, he will promulgate the regulationsby final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (see proposed andSection;641.27 for additionaldetail).<ITAG tagnum="84">Permits and Reporting Requirements </ITAG>Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations require a permitin order to fish for reef fish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) undera commercial quota or to sell reef fish taken from the EEZ. To qualityfor permit, a person must derive more than 50 percent of his or her earnedincome from commercial or charter (for hire) fishing. Permits would haveto be renewed annually and compliance with reporting requirements wouldbe a condition for issuance, reissuance, or continuing validity of a permit.The requirement that 50 percent of earned income be from commercial orcharter fishing to qualify for a permit was proposed, in part, becauseof the severe restrictions on commercial harvest necessary to restore theprincipal species in the fishery. By including this requirement, recreationalfishermen who previously sold their excess catch of reef fish would nolonger be able to do so and would be excluded from participating underthe commercial quotas for species for which quotas apply. Since there arelikely several thousand of such persons, this reduces the impact of theharvest restrictions on full-time and many part-time commercial fishermen.Most retirement income is not considered earned income under this permitrequirement.The purpose of the permit requirements is to ensure allocations are distributedas set forth by the Council and to improve enforcement of the recreationaland commercial catch limits. Without such delineation of these two majoruser groups, the catch limits proposed for the recreational sector willbe unenforceable and recreational catch that is sold would be counted againstthe commercial quota.In additional, the Council intends to develop in the future a limited accesssystem for the commercial fishery that may reduce participation levelseven further. The Council will submit for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice of a control date for entry into thefishery as the first step in developing such a system by subsequent amendment.Compliance with the reporting requirements was made a condition of theissuance, reissuance, and continued validity of the permit because onlyabout 15 percent of present permit holders (trap fishermen) have compliedwith the current reporting requirements. Sanctions for non-compliance aregoverned under 15 CFR part 904. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations include reportingrequirements for charter vessel operators. These requirements are generallyidentical to those currently applying to operators of headboats and arecombined with those for the coastal migratory pelagics fishery under 50CFR part 642. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations alsorequire persons holding permits to file a report during months when nofishing occurs and also make other minor technical changes to reportingrequirements to facilitate enforcement. The monthly report of no fishingis needed to ascertain periods when fishermen with permits are inactiveand to facilitate compliance during active periods of fishing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Vessel and Gear Identification </ITAG>The proposed implementing regulation would require a vessel for which apermit has been approved to display its official number in a manner visibleto both air and surface enforcement craft. Such an identification requirementcurrently applies to vessels with fish trap permits and would be extendedto apply to other permitted commercial vessels. This identification requirementis necessary to allow aerial enforcement of closed areas (e.g., areas wherelonglining is prohibited) and closed seasons (i.e., periods when all commercialfishing is prohibited after quotas are reached). <ITAG tagnum="84">Size Limits </ITAG>Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations retain 13 inchestotal length (TL) as the minimum size for possession of red snapper, buteliminate allowances for possession of undersized fish by fishermen (fiveper person) and for trawl vessels (unlimited) and prohibit sale of undersizedred snapper. The allowances for possession and sale of undersized fishlargely made the size limit ineffective (i.e., 39 percent of fish landedwere undersized). This was especially true for recreational fishermen sincetypically 50 percent or more of their trips yielded five or less fish,all of which could legally be undersized. An effective size limit for redsnapper would moderately increase yield per recruit (YPR) in terms of poundageavailable from the resource by about 5 percent, but initially (during firstyear) could reduce recreational landings by about 29 percent. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations also impose minimumsize and possession limits for black sea bass, lane and vermilion snapper(8 inches TL); for gray, mutton, and yellow-tail snapper (12 inches TL);for red, Nassau, gag, yellowfin and black groupers (20 inches TL); forgreater amberjack (28 nches fork length (FL) for recreational catch and36 inches FL for commercial catch) and for jewfish (50 inches TL). Allof these species are predominantly (up to 99 percent) harvested off Florida.Florida currently has size limits for most of these species that are identical,or slightly smaller, and is expected to adopt the same limits. Since size limits increase YPR, models were prepared that allowed computationof percent reduction in fishing mortality necessary to reach a 20 percentSSBR level at each minimum size. These models and information on size atmaturity were used in selecting the proposed size limits. For most of thesespecies, including red snapper, bag limits and quotas are also imposedto attain the desired reduction in fishing mortality as a function of theminimum size selected. For some species (black sea bass, lane and vermilionsnappers, and jewfish) the YPR from the size limit alone will be adequateto attain or maintain the 20 percent SSBR level. The larger size limitfor commercially harvested amberjack eliminates the necessity to set acommercial quota on that species. In order to facilitate enforcement andmake the size limits effective, fish would be required to be landed withheads and fins intact and sale of fish smaller than the minimum size wouldbe prohibited. <ITAG tagnum="84">Gear Restrictions </ITAG>Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations would reduce thenumber of fish traps that can be fished by each permitted vessel from 200to 100. Trap fishermen fishing the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) in 1986 used 30traps per vessel whereas those fishing the Florida Straits generally utilizeabout 200 according to testimony presented to the Council. Since the reeffish resources of the Gulf are being overfished, the Council proposed reducingthe allowable level of traps before trap levels reach those employed inthe adjacent Florida Straits. The proposed rule also would limit degradabledoor hinges and fasteners to jute string or magnesium fasteners since,according to fishermen, other materials deteriorate too slowly. <ITAG tagnum="84">Area Limitations </ITAG>Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations modify the boundaryof the stressed area by including waters of the EEZ shoreward of the 10-fathomcontour off Louisiana and shoreward of the 30-fathom contour off Texas.The FMP prohibits the use of fish traps, roller trawls, and powerheadsfor taking reef fish within the stressed area. The stressed area delineatesthe nearshore areas subject to the most intensive fishing pressure (primarilyby recreational fishermen who generally lack the capability to travel furtheroffshore), and use of more efficient and competing gear is, therefore,prohibited. The inclusion of these additional areas will reduce harveston the overfished red snapper stock because red snapper is the predominantreef fish species off Louisiana and Texas. Access to the coast of Louisianais much more restricted than to the coast of Texas, and consequently thenearshore waters are subject to less intensive fishing pressure; therefore,the proposed boundary is closer to shore (10 fathoms versus 30 fathoms)for Louisiana than for Texas. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations would prohibit theuse of longline and buoy gear for the directed harvest of reef fish inthe EEZ inshore of the 50-fathom contour west of Cape San Blas, Florida(85anddegrees;30andmin16; W. longitude) and inshore of the 20-fathom contoureast of Cape San Blas. The western restricted area generally covers therange of red snapper as very few occur east of Cape San Blas or outside50 fathoms. The prohibition will reduce the impact of those gears whichtypically have harvested large red snapper from the spawning stock andfrom areas (non-reef areas) where the catch per unit effort (CPUE) by othergear is too low to fish economically for the large spawners. Since fecundityfor red snapper increases exponentially with increasing size, it is importantto reduce catch of the larger fish in the depressed spawning stock. Sincemortality of fish released at the water surface increases with water depthfrom which they are caught, implementation of a maximum size limit to preservethe larger spawners likely would be an ineffective alternative to the prohibitionof buoy and longline gear from that area. The eastern restricted area is generally located within the range of redgrouper, the dominant species of shallow-water grouper. By expanding therestricted area, longline gear (the principal gear in the group fishery)and buoy gear could only be used outside of 20 fathoms. This will preventharvest and subsequent release mortality of groupers smaller than the 20-inchminimum size which are common inside of 20 fathoms. Since all groupersreverse sex as they grow and the larger fish are all males, there is lessconcern over the efficiency of longline and buoy gear to harvest the largerfish. <ITAG tagnum="84">Bag and Possession Limits, Allocations, and Closures </ITAG>Bag limits are imposed to reduce fishing mortality by recreational fishermenand quotas are imposed to reduce fishing mortality by commercial fishermen.Sale of certain reef fish would be prohibited for the remainder of thefishing year when the quota for those species or species groups is reached.Exception would be made for fish held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.Sale of reef fish taken in the EEZ under a bag limit would be prohibited.Persons fishing under a commercial quota would have to possess vessel permits.Persons on charter vessels and headboats (when under charter) and on commercialvessels temporarily excluded from fishing under a vessel permit (i.e.,vessels with trawl or net gear aboard and longline vessels fishing in therestricted area for species other than reef fish) would be limited to thebag limits, except that persons on charter vessels and headboats wouldbe allowed to possess up to two daily bag limits for trips of more than24 hours duration. For red snapper, Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulationswould impose a daily bag limit of seven fish for recreational fishermenand a quota of 3.1 million pounds for commercial fishermen. This is equivalentto a 20 percent reduction from the 1985-1987 level of fishing mortality(harvest) for the initial fishing year. This percentage reduction willnot restore the spawning stock to 20 percent SSBR by the year 200 (i.e.,long-term OY goal). However, the Procedure for establishing an annual TACand adjusting management measures allows an annual reassessment of progressmade in achieving OY and adjustments to the bag limit and quota to reachthat goal. The Council judged that a more gradual approach to reductionof fishing mortality would be less disruptive to the fishery and have lessadverse impact on users. The Procedure provides the safeguards to assurethat irreversible overfishing does not occur and that further adjustmentsto measures will be based on progressively more precise and accurate information.For groupers, Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations wouldimpose a daily bag limit of five fish of all species in aggregate (exceptjewfish) and separate commercial quotas of 9.2 million pounds for shallow-watergroupers and 1.8 million pounds for deep-water groupers (defined by species).This is equivalent to a 14 percent reduction from the 1985-1987 level offishing mortality (harvest) for the initial fishing year. Since initialestimates of the percent reduction in fishing mortality necessary to attain20 percent SSBR for groupers was approximately 20 percent, this level ofreduction (14 percent) may or may not attain the OY goal by the year 2000.However, the Procedure will allow assessing this annually and adjustingthe rules to attain that goal. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementing regulations would impose an aggregatedaily bag limit of 10 fish for all other snapper species, except for vermilionand lane snappers. This bag limit was proposed because restrictions placedon other reef fish species will result in transfer of effort toward harvestof these species, which are predominantly harvested by recreational fishermen.The measures that would be imposed under this proposed rule will be assessedannually under the Procedure. Vermilion and lane snapper were excludedfrom bag limits and allocations because they become sexually mature ata size smaller than the minimum size limit (e.g., vermilion mature at 6inches TL) and are therefore protected from recruitment overfishing. Amendment 1 and the proposed implementating regulations would impose adaily bag limit of three fish with a 28-inch FL minimum size and a largercommercial size limit (36-inch FL) for greater amberjack to reduce harvestequitably. The harvest of greater amberjack has been largely by recreationalfishermen with the harvest level escalating in recent years as they becomea targeted substitute for less abundant reef fish. Commercial harvest,while much less, has also increased. The recreational bag and the sizelimits will result in about a 60 percent reduction from the 1985-1987 harvestlevel in the initial years until the fish reach a larger size. The bag limits are intended to reduce recreational harvest while spreadingthe reduced individual catch over the fishing year, whereas the quotasare intended to allow commercial harvest to be taken as efficiently aspossible and to prohibit harvest for sale when the quota is taken duringeach fishing year. The possession of two days bag limits (of legal sizefish) is proposed for charter vessels and headboats since many of thesevessels traditionally have made multi-day trips to more distant reef complexes.In all other cases, the possession limits would be the bag limits. The prohibition on sale of reef fish taken under a bag limit will preventrecreational harvest and bycatch from being counted in the commercial quotasand thereby intensify the impact of the reduced allocation level on thatuser group. Once a quota for a species or species group is reached, directedfishing and sale of that species or group would be prohibited for the remainderof the fishing year. This is necessary to assure that the allocation notbe exceeded. After such a closure, all persons in the reef fish fisherywould be subject to the possession limit or daily bag limit, which cannotbe sold. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Changes </ITAG>In addition to the changes to the existing regulations necessary to implementAmendment 1, NOAA proposes other changes to facilitate enforcement andto make corrections and clarifications. Revisions to the purpose and scope section (andSection; 641.1) are proposedto indicate the full geographical scope of the regulations by specifyingthose sections that apply in state waters adjoining the EEZ. NOAA believesthe public is better served by a general expression of scope in this sectionwith the specific scope of each general provision or management measurestated in that provision or measure. This approach avoids the possibilityof misleading fishermen, dealers, and processors as to the scope of theregulations in this part. The definition and use of the term Managementarea would be removed. The term Exclusive economic zone (EEZ), definedat 50 CFR 620.2 and applicable to part 641, in the context of the geographicalscope specified in andSection; 641.1, adequately specifies the extent ofeach management measure. The proposed regulations would prohibit the possession of dynamite or asimilar explosive substance on board vessels in the reef fish fishery.The use of explosives, excluding those in powerheads, is currently prohibited.Nevertheless, there are persistent reports and indications of the illegaluse of dynamite. Indications include underwater explosions not assocaitedwith sesmic testing or oil rig removal, the landing of reef fish by vesselswithout operable fishing gear aboard, and the presence ashore of reef fishwithout the typical markings associated with fish caught by hook, net,or fish traps. Enforcement of the prohibition on use of explosives in thereef fish fishery has been thwarted by the large area that constitutesthe fishing grounds, the small number of available enforcement vessels,and the resultant difficulty of catching a person in the act of using explosives.NOAA is not aware of any legitimate use of dynamite or a similar explosivesubstance aboard a fishing vessel in the reef fish fishery. Enforcementof the basic prohibition would be enchanced since it will not be necessaryto observe the use of dynamite in the fishery. The gear restrictions applicable to fish traps would be reorganized forclarity into a single subsection (andSection;641.22(b)). Other minor reorganizationsand corrections are proposed for clarity and to conform the regulationsto current usage. NOAA expects the initial permit fee and the fee for fish trap identificationtags proposed under andSection;641.4(c) to be approximately $23 and $1 pertag, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act, as amended by Public Law99-659, requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulationsproposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of an FMP amendment andregulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment1, which this proposed rule would implement, is consistent with the NationalStandards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law.The Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account thedata, views, and comments received during the comment period.The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, has initially determinedthat this proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring the preparationof a regulatory impact analysis under E.O. 12291. This proposed rule, ifadopted, is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Council prepared a RIR which concludes that this rule will have thefollowing economic effects: over the short-term, the economic output wouldbe reduced by $35.9 to $55 million, income by $12.4 to $18.7 million andjobs by 903 to 1,364. These effects would be $15.6 million in output, $5.7million in income, and 412 jobs for the commercial sector and $20.3 to$39.4 in economic output, $6.7 to $13 million in income, and 491 to 952jobs for the recreational sector. Annual cost to the federal governmentfor enforcement and administration is estimated to be $160.000. The overalllong-term net effect will be positive for both commercial and recreationalsectors through restoring the stocks over a ten-year period. Copies ofthe RIR may be obtained from the address listed above.This proposed rule is exempt from the procedures of E.O. 12291 under section8(a)(2) of that order. It is being reported to the Director, Office ofManagement and Budget, with an explanation of why it is not possible tofollow the procedures of that order.The Council prepared a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) as part ofthe RIR which describes the effects this rule, if adopted, would have onsmall business entities. Based on the RFA, the Assessment Administratorfor Fisheries, NOAA, concludes that this rule, if adopted, would have significanteffects on small entities, summarized as follows: The prohibition on saleor reef fish taken as incidental catch by trawl vessels (6,000) from theEEZ will result in an annual exvessel loss of $7 per fisherman or $17.50per vessel. According to the most recent available data, there are 931commercial vessels in the directed fishery for reef fish. Since reef fishtaken by entangling net vessels are almost all taken from state waters,the prohibition on sale of reef fish taken by this gear from the EEZ willhave a little impact on the 29 commercial vessels that use this gear. Therewill be a short-term reduction of gross exvessel revenue on the other 902commercial vessels in the fishery, primarily the result of increased sizelimits. In the intermediate- and long-term, this reduction will largelybe restored as the fish grow to a larger size. The amount of the short-termreduction will be equivalent to $8,824 per vessel. Part of this impactwill actually accrue to recreational and part-time fishermen (several thousand)who will be unable to obtain a permit and, thus, will be prohibited fromselling reef fish, rather than to the commercial vessels. If the bag andsize limits deter fishermen from fishing on the 920 charter vessels andheadboats, the short-term annual reduction in revenue per vessel couldrange between $243 and $6,902. It is anticipated the impact will be atthe low end of the range. The effects related to the size limits wouldbe recovered in the following and subsequent years. Initial permit andfish trap identification tag costs would be $23 and $1, respectively. Permitcosts for commercial vessels would be $23 and fish trap identificationtags would cost $1. Over the ten-year horizon for rebuilding the stocks,the short-term losses affecting small business entities should be regainedand positive benefits should occur after several years. Copies of the RFAmay be obtained from the address listed above.The Council has determined that this rule will be implemented in a mannerthat is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approvedcoastal zone management programs of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.Texas does not have an approved coastal zone management program. Thesedeterminations have been submitted for review by the responsible stateagencies under section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.The Council prepared an EA that discusses the impact on the environmentas a result of this rule. Copies of the EA may be obtained at the addresslisted above and comments on it are requested.This proposed rule contains two new collection-of-information requirementsand revises three existing requirements subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct. A request to collect this information has been submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget for approval. The new requirements are (1) a reportingsystem for charter vessels, and (2) an annual vessel permitting system.The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimatedto average 3 and 15 minutes, respectively, per response, including thetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionsof information. Revision to the existing requirements will require (1)vessels fishing traps and (2) other commercial vessels to file monthlyreports whether or not they fished and (3) headboats to submit monthlyrather than quarterly reports and include the operator's U.S. Coast Guardlicense number. The public reporting burdens for these revised collectionsof information are estimated to average 3, 3, and 5 minutes respectively,per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collections of information. Send comments on these reportingburden estimates or any other aspect of the collection of information,included suggestions for reducing the burdens, to NMFS and OMB (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O.12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 641</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

(b) The Council will convene a scientific assessment panel (Panel) thatwill annually review the SAFE report and other relevant data, and willprepare a written report to the Council specifying a range of acceptablebiological catch (ABC) for each stock or stock complex in the managementunit identified by the Council, NMFS, or the Panel. The ABCs shall be calculatedso as to achieve reef fish population levels at or above the 20 percentSSBR goal by January 1, 2000. Where data are inadequate to compute theSSBR model, the Panel will provide the best estimate of ABC that shouldresult in at least 20 percent SSBR level. The ABC ranges will prevent anoverfished stock from further decline. A risk analysis showing the probabilitiesof attaining the stock goal and the annual transitional yields will becalculated for each level of F within the ABC range. The Panel report willinclude recommendations on quotas, bag limits, size limits, specific gearlimits, season closures, and other restrictions required to attain themanagement goal, along with the associated economic and social impacts.(c) The Council will conduct a public hearing on the Panel report(s) ator prior to the time it is considered by the Council for subsequent action.Other public hearings may be held also. The Council will request reviewof the report(s) by its advisory panel and scientific and statistical committeesand may convene these groups to provide advice before taking action. (d) The Council in selecting a TAC level for each stock or stock complexfor which an ABC range has been identified, in addition to taking intoconsideration the recommendations provided for in paragraphs (a), (b),and (c) of this section will: (1) Set TAC within or below the ABC range or set a series of annual TACsthat come within the ABC range within three years or less; and (2) Subdivide the TACs into commercial and recreational allocations whichmaximize the net benefits of the fishery to the nation. The allocationswill be based on historical percentages harvested by each user group duringthe base period of 1979-87. However, if the harvest in any year exceedsthe allocation for either the recreational or commercial user group, subsequentallocations pertaining to the respective user group will be adjusted toassure meeting the January 1, 2000, spawning stock biomass per recruitgoal. (e) The Council will provide its recommendations to the Regional Directorfor implementing or changing TACs for each stock or stock complex, thequotas, bag limits, trip limits, size limits, closed seasons, and gearrestrictions necessary to attain the TAC, along with the reports, a regulatoryimpact review and environmental assessment of impacts, and the proposedregulations, before October 15 of each year, or such other time as agreedupon by the Council and the Regional Director. (f) Prior to each fishing year, or such other time as agreed upon by theRegional Director and the Council, the Regional Director will review theCouncil's recommendations and supporting information and, if he concursthat the recommendations are consistent with the objectives of the FMP,the national standards, and other applicable law, he shall forward forpublication notice of proposed TACs and associted management measures (harvestrestrictions) by November 1, of each year or such other time as agreedupon by the Council and the Regional Director, providing up to 30 daysfor additional public comment. The Regional Director will take into considerationall information received and will forward for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the notice of final rule by December 1 of eachyear, or such other time as agreed upon by theCouncil and the RegionalDirector. (g) Appropriate management measures that may be implemented or modifiedby proposed and final rules include: (1) The TACs for each stock or stock complex that are designed to achievea specific level of ABC within the first year or annual levels of TAC designedto achieve the ABC level within three years. (2) Bag limits, size limits, vessel trip limits, closed seasons or areas,gear restrictions, and quotas designed to achieve the TAC level. 9.
