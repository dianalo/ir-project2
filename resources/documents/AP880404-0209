I want that person to be apart of my life.''   Amy Winn, 20, of East Lansing, the birth mother of the Sprys'1-year-old son, says open adoption has been ideal for her.   ``The reason I know that I'll never try to get him back isbecause I can always know how he's doing and how much he's beingloved,'' she says.   The potential for interference by the birth parent is acriticism that Gritter hears often. He contends that the openenvironment discourages harassment.   ``When a woman enters our program, her whole plan is for thechild to do well in life and for her to know how the child isdoing. For her to misbehave in any way really only serves toundercut her very own plan,'' Gritter says.   The open adoption agreement is legally non-binding and eitherparty can pull out at any time.   One of the major benefits is that the adoptive parents can belicensed as foster parents so the baby can be placed with themimmediately after birth. In closed adoptions, the child must go toa separate foster family for several weeks until the end of thelegal period during which the birth mother can change her mind.   With the benefit of getting the baby early comes the risk thatthe adoptive parents will have to give the baby back if the birthmother changes her mind before signing the release papers.   Fifteen percent of the women who enter the Traverse City programdecide to keep their babies before that legal period is over.   Gritter said that's a positive.   ``From the outset, our goal is to find a way to keep the babywith the birth parents,'' he says. ``If the birth mother changesher mind, we're with her 100 percent.''   Such situations are difficult for the adoptive parents.   The Sprys' second child was with them four days when they foundout his biological father was preparing to sue for custody. Theygave the baby back.   ``The program prepared us for that possibility,'' Spry says.``We never lost faith in the program. And we jumped right back intoit.''   Critics say women who request open adoption often do so becausethey're psychologically unready to part with the child.   Gritter counters that it's perfectly natural for a woman to wantto remain part of the child's life. In fact, he worries about birthmothers who seek a closed adoption.   ``We worry that their motivation is a sort of denial and thatthey won't come out of it as healthy as the birth parent who hasactively done what she could for their child,'' he says.   The Traverse City program grew out of Gritter's desire to seebirth parents treated more humanely and to allow adoptees to haveas much autobiographical information as possible.   He also believes that the principles on which confidentialadoption was originally based _ to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy_ are obsolete.   But leaders in the field of traditional adoption contend thatopen adoption is based on the faulty premise that closed adoptionhas not worked.   ``There has never been reliable data to show that adoptedchildren suffer emotionally,'' says Jeff Rosenberg, spokesman forthe National Committee for Adoption, an adoption advocacy groupbased in Washington, D.C.   Rosenberg compares openness to joint custody in a divorcesettlement.   ``It's not joint physical custody, but it is joint psychologicalcustody,'' he says.   His biggest fear centers on the relative newness of openadoption.   ``There's no way to know what kind of effect this will have onchildren,'' he says. ``What gives these people the right toexperiment with children's lives?''   Gritter says the effects of open adoption won't be known untilthe children mature and follow-up studies are done. But he predictsthat within 10 years all adoptions will feature some sort ofopenness because birth parents will insist on it.   ``Its underlying principles are that honesty and openness aregenerally healthier than secrecy and deception,'' says Gritter.``It's based on the idea that people are entitled to as muchinformation about themselves as possible, that they should haveaccess to the information that is vital for their sense of self.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 17</NOTE></DOC>
