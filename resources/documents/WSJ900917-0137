The discovery is the first sign that the Georgia corn cropmight have been contaminated by the potent carcinogen, whichis excreted by a soil fungus under droughtlike conditions.After the nationwide drought in 1988, contaminated milk inseveral states was traced to dairy cows that had beenunknowingly fed aflatoxin-laced corn.</LP><TEXT>   The threat to consumers isn't clear. Mr. Irvin said that1,395 gallons of milk from the unidentified processor weredestroyed long before it reached stores. But Georgia milkprocessors face a difficult year. The early indication isthat aflatoxin might be widespread in the state's corn crop,much of which is fed to livestock.   Of 45 Georgia corn fields recently surveyed for state andfederal authorities, about 60% were found to have aflatoxinin excess of the amount considered safe for humanconsumption.   Because of the region's warm climate, corn grown in theSouth is the most vulnerable in the nation to aflatoxinoutbreaks. Crop experts have been worried about the chancesof an aflatoxin outbreak in Georgia since an intense hot anddry spell damaged much of the corn crop in June.   Aflatoxin is a carcinogen in laboratory rats and has beenlinked to human liver cancer in Asia and Africa. For morethan a decade, the poison has been detected in Southernersand doctors have debated whether it is a serious healthhazard.   Earlier this month, aflatoxin was detected by officials inTexas corn corps, the second such outbreak there in as manyyears.   The most serious aflatoxin outbreak occurred during the1988 drought that seared the Midwest. Dairy farmers in sixstates dumped milk, and authorities detected the poison inmilled corn and such products as popcorn and cereal.</TEXT></DOC>
