Israeli officials want to lure 100,000 Soviet immigrants overthe next three years, a forecast many feel is optimistic. This isbecause the new brand of Soviet emigrants, unlike those of the1970s, are more interested in lifestyle than ideology.   ``(Israel's) message of `Jews, come home' does not work,'' InnaShapiro, who immigrated 14 years ago and recently revisited theSoviet Union, said on Israel's state television.   ``Nobody asks if it feels good to be a Jew in Israel. They justwant a better life,'' she said.   Earlier Soviet immigrants, many ardent nationalists, mock thematerialism of what they call ``sausage emigrants'' _ those whoseek quality food and goods that are in short supply in Moscow.   Mikhail Chlenov, chairman of the newly opened Jewish CulturalAssociation in Moscow, agreed during a recent visit to Israel thattoday's emigrants are different.   ``They are more assimilated. Their reasons are not specificallyJewish,'' he said. ``Mostly, they are worried over the government'sinstability, the spread of anti-Semitism, economic crisis.''   Perhaps the strongest deterrent to immigration here is theexperience of many of the 250,000 who have settled in Israel since1967.   Their tribulations in finding good jobs and houses, dealing withthe tensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict and finding a place in aninsular, native-born society have filtered back to the SovietUnion, influencing some future immigrants to choose the UnitedStates instead of Israel.   ``Israel's media and society gave the immigrants of the 1970s ahostile reception. Economic incentives granted to new immigrants,especially housing mortgages, have constantly changed for theworse,'' said Yitzhak Yuzefpolsky, an electrical engineer who camehere in 1974.   The emigration of the 1970s, he said, included outstandingscientists, engineers and artists who have since left Israel or whowent directly to the United States because ``Israel could notcreate the minimal conditions necessary for their work.''   In an effort to make the Jewish state more attractive, theCabinet announced Oct. 30 a detailed program to build 25,000 newhousing units, start vocational training programs, create new jobsand open new classrooms.   Amos Rubin, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's economic adviser,said Israel will try to raise $1 billion in donations and loansabroad, mostly from Jews in the United States, to go with the $2billion it plans to provide in Israel.   Barring an unexpected flood of immigrants, he said Israel wouldnot seek new U.S. government aid, now $3 billion a year. Israelwould, however, ask for U.S. guarantees to underwrite a bond issueto raise $400 million for private housing.   Where the immigrants will be settled is a major issue.   One controversial plan by Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretzcalls for channeling the flow to rundown development towns inremote areas where factories are closing and unemployment is high.   Another proposal put forward by Yitzhak David, Shamir's adviseron Jewish affairs, recommends Soviet Jews be settled in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Liberal critics argue the plan would deter Soviet Jews who didnot want to be thrust into the midst of the Palestinian revolt andwould complicate relations with Washington. The U.S. administrationhas announced it would reject any effort to help settle immigrantsin the occupied territories.   So far, the effort to attract Soviets has been a stingingfailure. In the first 10 months of this year, 7,275 out of 51,080Soviet Jewish emigrants came to Israel, according to Uri Gordon, asenior official in the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency.   He said 284,550 of the 2.5 million Soviet Jews have requestedsponsors abroad so far this year. He predicts half will come here.   The United States, where 162,000 Soviet Jews have settled in thepast two decades, has become the main magnet for Soviet emigrants.   ``Businessmen from the United States told me that Soviet Jewshave created many jobs there. And in Israel, they only say that wetake jobs from others,'' said Vladimir Lifschitz, who arrived twoyears ago after a long battle with Soviet authorities to get anexit visa.   Some Israeli officials see hope for an increase in immigrationto Israel as a result of new U.S. immigration restrictions thathave put a ceiling of 50,000 Soviet refugees next year.   But activists say an influx should not be taken for granted.   ``They think the Jews ... will come here of their own, justbecause of the economic instability and anti-Semitism there and theclosing doors in the United States,'' Natan Sharansky, an immigrantrights activist, told the Jerusalem Post.   Sharansky, a dissident freed in 1986 after nine years in Sovietlabor camps, said, ``I'm very much afraid that after the first10,000 to 15,000 come ... there will be a catastrophe. (Apartment)prices will rise, there will be fewer jobs, the old absorptionproblems will surface anew.''   Israel's Absorption Ministry is currently financing jobs forsome 350 immigrant scientists and engineers but officials say theyare unable to handle any more cases. In addition, 100 scientistsfrom the Soviet Union and Romania are here looking for work, and 50others are in the Soviet Union awaiting word on job openings.   One Soviet scientist who visited Israel recently as a touristsaid he abandoned emigration plans after consulting with Sovietswho had immigrated earlier.   ``I found out I could practice psychiatry but would have to giveup decades of research in neurology,'' said the scientist, whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``I could continue my work in theUnited States, but for that I would not emigrate.''</TEXT></DOC>
