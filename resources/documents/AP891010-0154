He also called on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to follow hisexample and meet Palestinian leaders ``to continue the search forpeace.''   Nearby, a protester hoisted a huge red-and-white balloon thatsaid: ``Dialogue, Not Bloodshed.'' A trumpet blared, and youngsupporters sang ``Give Peace a Chance.''   The six-month sentence of the 63-year-old Nathan comes at a timewhen Israel's coalition government is deeply split over whether tomeet with a PLO-sanctioned delegation in Cairo to discuss proposalsfor bringing peace to the Israeli-occupied territories.   Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc on Friday jettisoned a proposalfor such talks by its coalition partner, the Labor Party. It saidthe plan could lead Israel to indirect talks with the PLO, which itconsiders a terrorist group and refuses to meet.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a meetingwith the Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers within two weeks totry to revive stalled peace efforts, Israeli and U.S. officialssaid Tuesday.   Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidBaker had proposed the three-way meeting be held in Washington towork on terms of Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo.   Meanwhile, left-wing Israeli legislators said they would try tochange the 1986 ``Anti-Terror Amendment'' under which Nathan wasconvicted for a September 1988 meeting with Arafat in Tunis,Tunisia.   The law provides for a maximum three-year sentence forunauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist organization.   Several Israeli activists have previously been sentenced to sixmonths for meeting with PLO leaders in Bucharest, Romania, inNovember 1986, but they remain free awaiting rulings on appeals.   Nathan, sentenced on Oct. 3 after pleading guilty to thecharges, did not file an appeal.   Before entering the minimum-security lockup Tuesday, Nathanvowed to continue his peace efforts in an emotional speech to 700supporters.   ``They clipped my wings only for a little while, but they know Iwill be back on the air,'' said Nathan.   Nathan is owner of the ``Voice of Peace,'' an unauthorized radiostation that broadcasts to Israel and neighboring Arab states froma ship in the Mediterranean Sea.   The Indian-born Nathan became known as a crusader in 1964 whenhe made a dramatic flight to Cairo to appeal for peace.   In the West Bank on Tuesday, an Arab assailant who allegedlycollaborated with Israeli authorities fatally shot a 16-year-oldPalestinian in the chest in the refugee camp Fawwar, claiming theyouth stoned his car, Arab reports said. The army confirmed thefatality but gave no details.   Elsewhere in the occupied territories, soldiers shot and wounded11 Palestinians during clashes with stone-throwing demonstrators,the reports said.   During the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation, 587Palestinians and 40 Israelis have been killed. Palestinians havekilled more than 120 suspected collaborators with the Israelis.   Also Tuesday, Israel radio quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabinas saying 40,000 Palestinians have been detained during theuprising and more than 15,000 wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
