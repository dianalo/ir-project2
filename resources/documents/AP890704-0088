Pierce Jr. ordered his staffto override objections and approve a North Carolina apartmentproject promoted by a former law partner, it was reported.   Pierce, who served under President Reagan, told Congress on May25 that he took no such actions.   Former Federal Housing Commissioner Shirley McVay Wiseman saidPierce played a major role in the rent subsidy program now underinvestigation for alleged influence peddling by well-connected GOPfigures, the Los Angeles Times reported today.   Records in Durham, N.C., show that Louis Kitchin, one of formerPresident Reagan's key operatives in the South, received $40,000 inconsulting fees for an $11 million project for converting a formerhosiery mill into HUD-subsidized apartments for the elderly.   Charles B. Markham, the Republican mayor of Durham in 1985 and ahigh-ranking official in the HUD under President Nixon, was one ofthe project's chief backers. Markham had been one of Pierce's lawpartners in New York during the 1960s, unidentified sources told theTimes.   On Monday, The Wall Street Journal also reported that Pierce tookextraordinary steps on behalf of the project. The newspaper saidthat there is no indication Markham had any financial interest inthe project.   The long-stalled project was given a big boost after Pierceintervened with a multimillion-dollar series of HUD grants andsubsidies, the Times said. City officials in Durham said the projecthas helped revitalize a poor area.   It had drawn opposition within HUD from critics who complainedthat the project would cost the agency too much and that toxic wastehad been buried nearby.   In congressional testimony on May 25, Pierce said he told HUDofficials to give ``careful consideration'' to housingrehabilitation proposals by such Republicans as former InteriorSecretary James G. Watt. But Pierce insisted he left the finaldecision on such projects up to Ms. Dean and two other top officials.   However, Ms. Wiseman said she resigned from the HUD shortly afterrefusing to obey orders from Pierce and his executive assistant,Deborah Gore Dean, to approve funding for the project.   ``I was directed to sign it twice, by Deborah Dean and by thesecretary,'' said Ms. Wiseman, who is now a Lexington, Ky.,developer and president of the National Association of HomeBuilders. ``The secretary called and ordered me to sign it, and Isaid that I couldn't do that.''   Ms. Dean refused through her lawyer, Joseph E. diGenova, todiscuss the Durham project.   An unidentified confidant of Ms. Dean's told the Times that Ms.Dean said she told Ms. Wiseman to sign the waivers for the project,but insisted she was following orders from Pierce.   The waivers were eventually signed by Ms. Wiseman's successor,Janet Hale, now associate director of the White House Budget office.She refused on Monday to discuss the case.   Pierce did not respond to requests from the Times to discuss theDurham project.   A telephone call to Ms. Wiseman's home today went unanswered.   The Wall Street Journal said that HUD's inspector general, actingon an anonymous tip, began investigating the project before finalfunding was approved and found no substantiation of charges of undueinfluence.   Meanwhile, a senior government official in Washington saidnursing homes ``will probably be next'' among federal housingprograms that have been targeted for sharp cutbacks in theinvestigation of mismanagement at HUD.   The department is reviewing an inspector general's audit of theRetirement Service program and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp could makedecisions about the program as early as next week, the HUD officialsaid Monday.   The Retirement Service program helps provide financing fornursing homes and other housing for the elderly.   Today's New York Times said HUD is considering overhaul ortermination of the program in the wake of an inspector general'saudit that found half of the 24 projects examined in the Midwestwere in default or financially troubled.   Kemp has acted to suspend or terminate other department programsin the wake of highly critical audits by the inspector general.   ``Nursing homes will probably be next,'' said the official, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The newspaper also said the problems would leave the governmentliable for hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages on troubledhousing for the elderly. The official gave no estimate of possiblelosses.   Last week Kemp canceled a mortgage insurance program after anaudit found 25 of 58 projects financed through the program haddefaulted. The department estimated the outstanding debts would costthe government $90 million.   Other federal housing programs, including subsidies forrehabilitation of housing for those with low and moderate incomes, acoinsurance program and a program in which at least one privateescrow agent who handled sales of foreclosed property has admittedstealing more than $5 million, are under investigation by Congressand the Justice Department for mismanagement, politicalinfluence-peddling and other abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
