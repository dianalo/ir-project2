The savings and loan holding company attributed the lower projection for the quarter, ending next Thursday, to unexpectedly high consumer loan losses. The company has about 4.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding.    In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $1.2 million, or 25 cents a share on a fully diluted basis.    Pioneer Financial also said it began a program to invest $1 million in the purchase of its own common stock or preferred stock, or both. </TEXT></DOC>
