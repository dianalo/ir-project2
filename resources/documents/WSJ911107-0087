(FDC)FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The House Banking Committee quickly passed astripped-down banking bill to rebuild the deposit insurancefund and tighten bank regulation, but House leadersimmediately began considering ways to broaden the bill toallow banks to branch across state lines.   As a result, when the banking committee plan reaches theHouse Rules Committee, possibly today, several amendmentscould be added as part of an effort to pass legislation thatgoes beyond the politically unpopular need to establish a new$70 billion line of credit for the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.</LP><TEXT>   But Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas)warned that &quot;to open the door to other amendments is aninvitation to another bloodbath on the floor -- and, mostimportantly, a delay in protecting depositors.&quot; On Monday,the House overwhelmingly rejected a broad banking bill thatwould have bolstered the bank insurance fund, allowed banksto branch nationwide, enabled banks to enter the securitiesbusiness under rules that big banks said were too tough, andlimited bank authority to sell insurance.   The bill the Banking Committee cleared yesterday on a37-15 vote would expand the FDIC's borrowing authority andspecify that banks must repay the loans. It also establishesa framework for bank supervision that requires regulators toimpose prompt corrective measures on weak banks and to closebanks before they become insolvent. And starting in 1995, theFDIC no longer would be able to reimburse foreign depositsand other uninsured deposits -- those above $100,000 -- as itoften does now.   The Bush administration, however, has suggested that itmight veto any bill that doesn't include measures to allowbanks to establish nationwide branch networks, a move thatcould save major banks millions of dollars annually inoperating costs. Many Democrats also favor branching. As aresult, the House leadership is looking for a way to addbranching to the committee's narrow bill.   &quot;We want to develop a proposal that, if passed, would beapproved as well,&quot; said Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).   But the insurance industry, which has lobbied effectivelyso far to restrict the ability of banks to sell insurance,insists that any interstate branching provision also rollback current bank insurance powers. And any concession to theinsurance industry is likely to trigger demands from thesecurities industry for protection as well.   As a compromise, some Democrats are considering includingin the bill a moratorium on regulatory authority to issuerules enabling banks to expand their activities in thesecurities and insurance fields. The more the bill is loadedup with such measures, the less attractive it becomes to theadministration and many banks.   Rules Committee Chairman Joseph Moakley (D., Mass.) said,however, &quot;I understand there may be some amendments needed toget the support needed to pass the bill.&quot;   Republicans have said they won't vote for a bill thatdoesn't include branching, and most Democrats won't vote fora bank rescue plan that doesn't command strong Republicansupport. &quot;After the Sandamp;L crisis, members are afraid to votefor anything, &quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). &quot;Theonly way to pass a bill is to have a bipartisan coalition.&quot;   Mr. Gonzalez, the banking committee chairman, saidCongress must move quickly to recapitalize the bank insurancefund, adding that the FDIC already has delayed closing failedbanks because it doesn't have enough money -- an assertionthe FDIC denies. &quot;Forbearance, as we learned in thesavings-and-loan crisis, is extremely costly and very poorpublic policy,&quot; he said.   The Resolution Trust Corp. has delayed closing failedthrifts because it has run out of money. The agency toldCongress that the delays add between $3.3 million and $4.4million a day to the cost of the thrift cleanup. Theadministration has asked Congress for an additional $80billion for the RTC.</TEXT></DOC>
