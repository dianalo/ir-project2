The 13-year-old girl who battled organ rejection, hepatitis andmedical complications before her body suddenly rejected hertransplanted heart last Sunday, was laid to rest in a cemetery inthis suburb of Fort Worth.   At a 45-minute funeral service, many of the estimated 400mourners burst into laughter several times as Jerry Conley, aminister at West Freeway Church of Christ, celebrated her life.   ``Everything was always upbeat with this very special child,''Conley said. ``Stormie has conquered life more gallantly perhapsthan any person you or I have ever known. Her illness was not herenemy.   ``Stormie was a very simple young lady,'' he said. ``She didn'treally want all the fanfare that went with all of this. She wantedto bejust an average teen-age girl.''   She was later buried at a private ceremony attended only by herfamily and close friends.   At the church service, White Settlement Mayor James Herring reada resolution the City Council approved earlier in the week,recognizing Stormie as an honored citizen.   ``She lived her life for others,'' Herring said. ``She didn'tdesire the notoriety that came her way but she was willing to doher part as a result of that. When called upon to step forward andtalk to folks, talk to the news cameras ... she was always thereand ready and willing.''   Herring also read a poem one of Stormie's classmates wrote afterher death.   ``Most say you were just a little girl, but you were an angel tome,'' he read. ``You've been our little lady, your courage was sotrue. When things seemed to go bad, you always pulled through.''   Stormie died Nov. 10 at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh -where she underwent her historic operation on Feb. 14, 1984. Shehad been rushed to the hospital from her home with a sore throatand fever.   Doctors at the hospital said Friday that Stormie died becauseher body had suddenly rejected the transplanted heart. The autopsyresults surprised Stormie's doctors, who said an organ rejection somany years after a transplant was rare.   ``No one expected to see any rejection in Stormie,'' said Dr. F.Jay Fricker, her cardiologist at Children's. ``After all, we had atrack record of more than six years of never seeing any heartrejection. So why would we suddenly see it now?''   Fricker said it would take months for doctors to determine, ifat all, what caused the heart rejection.   Doctors declined to speculate whether FK-506, an experimentalanti-rejection drug Stormie began receiving last November, a secondliver transplant she underwent last February or treatment forrecurring bouts of hepatitis caused the rejection.   The blond, brown-eyed girl needed the heart-liver transplantbecause of hypocholesteremia, a rare genetic disorder thatprevented her body from processing cholesterol. Her sister, Misty,suffers from a milder form of the disease.   Stormie had few major medical problems the first five yearsafter her Valentine's Day transplant. But she had to return toPittsburgh in 1988 for surgery to remove a bile duct obstruction.   She underwent a mild episode of liver rejection in November 1989and began receiving the experimental FK-506 instead of thetraditional anti-rejection drug cyclosporine.   A bout with hepatitis in February slowly damaged her liver,requiring a second liver transplant. But clinical studies doneafter surgery showed no evidence of heart problems, Fricker said.   Stormie began rejecting the second liver in May and was treatedwith an increased dosage of FK-506. A month later, she receivedmedication for another bout of hepatitis.   Recent flu-like symptoms were the only indication something waswrong.</TEXT></DOC>
