Real-time irradiationmonitoring, dose control and dose assessment for some parts of the anatomycan be carried out only by making supplementary use of in vivo detectors.The study evaluates semiconductor detectors exposed to beams of electronsat 7 to 22 MeV and to 25 MV photons from a linear accelerator, and isin two parts: an experimental study of the sensor characteristics asaffected by the size of the received dose, dose rate, energy, incidenceof the beam and temperature; and an in vivo study of their use in treatmentprotocols, with the modelling done beforehand or correlation effectedwith the results from other measurement or calculation techniques. Theexperimental study on the 'electron' sensors showed that these detectorswere rather anisotropic, with a major loss of signal on tangential irradiation;certain irradiation positions must be corrected for in order to makethese detectors acceptable in use. They are temperature-sensitive andtheir response is energy-dependent, and corrections must therefore bemade as necessary. The 'photon' detectors give a nominal response towithin about 2% when inside a cone with an angle of less than 60 deg.;otherwise, the response increases to as much as +8%, which is a majordrawback given the degree of precision required. Nevertheless, the attractivefeatures of these detectors and their high performance in the other parametersstudied make it evident that these sensors are useful in carrying outthe treatment plan in the proper manner. This point of view is furtherdeveloped. (author). 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
