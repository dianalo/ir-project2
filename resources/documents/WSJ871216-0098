PerryStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   To the dismay of most Democratic Party leaders and candidates, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado stood on the steps of the state capitol in Concord, N.H., yesterday with his smiling wife at his side and said, &quot;I'm back in the race.&quot;    The 51-year-old Mr. Hart, who withdrew from the campaign May 8 after disclosures about his relationship with 29-year-old Miami model Donna Rice, told reporters he was running again because he is a candidate of new ideas that no one else is discussing. But his first challenge could be a surge of new and damaging revelations about liaisons with other women.    &quot;We've got a national 'Gong Show' anyway, and here's one more guy in a funny suit coming on the stage,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;I feel insulted by it.&quot;    &quot;This is outrageous,&quot; said Richard Winters of Hanover, N.H., a member of that state's Democratic state committee. &quot;It has the potential of being a party-wrecking move. It contaminates discussions among the candidates. It brings into the public forum the kinds of personal issues -- judgment, morality -- that we just don't need.&quot;    The news that Mr. Hart was back in the race was generally greeted with derision. He was booed by some people in Concord when he announced he was running again. Others shouted to him that he was wrecking the party. And, inevitably, there was a renewal of jokes about his sex life. Example: There are now seven dwarfs running for the Democratic nomination and the seventh one is called Randy.    &quot;These jokes going around town are the last thing we need,&quot; says Ann Lewis, former Democratic Party political director.    Republicans could hardly believe the news. &quot;I think it's great,&quot; said Frank Fahrenkopf, the Republican national chairman. &quot;I love it.&quot;    Mr. Hart announced he would aim his campaign at &quot;idealists,&quot; but many Democrats wondered whether his motives weren't more selfish. At last report with the Federal Election Commission, the Hart campaign had $29 in the bank and owed nearly $55,000, with another $1.1 million still due on his 1984 campaign. And, it was pointed out, by jumping back in the race now, Mr. Hart probably will be able to claim an instant federal subsidy of about $1 million, payable in January.    Many Democrats fear that the Hart re-entry will give them a black eye. They worry that the Hart saga will play out like a soap opera, turning what was supposed to be a serious search for a presidential candidate into a ludicrous spectacle.    &quot;This is tragic,&quot; says Timothy Hagan, the president of the Cuyahoga County Commissioners and a prominent Ohio Democrat. &quot;Why is it that we have these people? Why can't the Republicans get some of them?&quot;    Jokes aside, Mr. Hart surely appeals to some Democrats who haven't been inspired by the other candidates. Once the front-runner in the race, Mr. Hart plummeted by 30 points in some polls after stories appeared about his spending a weekend with Miss Rice in Washington and cavorting with her on a boat named Monkey Business in Bimini, a Caribbean resort. But even after he pulled out of the race, he collected the support of 17% of Democrats and independents in a poll early in November by Penn andamp; Schoen Associates of New York. That placed him dead even for the lead with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and seven points ahead of third-place Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.    Now Mr. Hart, who was uncomfortable in the role of front-runner during the weeks leading to his withdrawal, once again casts himself as an insurgent. His targets this time are not only the well-established codes of political behavior that he railed against with such success in 1984 and in the first segment of the 1988 race, but also the national press corps.    &quot;The time is ripe for some candidate to tell the press to stuff it,&quot; says John Reilly, a close adviser to former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984. &quot;He's going to run with an apparent disdain for the press.&quot;    In his New Hampshire announcement, Mr. Hart made no reference to the events that drove him from the race and, in fact, stressed the support of his wife, Lee, and his two children, Andrea and John. &quot;We are together on this decision,&quot; he said, &quot;because we love this country and because we are not quitters.&quot;    He withdrew after a Washington Post reporter told campaign officials the paper was preparing a story detailing other extramarital affairs. Benjamin C. Bradlee, the Post's executive editor, refuses to say whether the paper will now publish the additional material. Although, late yesterday, in political circles there was widespread assumption that the Post would run the story.    Mr. Hart planned to begin his campaign by touring New Hampshire by auto with his wife. &quot;This will not be like any campaign you've ever seen, because I'm going directly to the people,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't have a national headquarters or staff. I don't have any money. I don't have any pollsters or consultants, or media advisers, or political endorsements. But I have something better. I have the power of ideas, and I can govern this country.&quot;    Those close to Mr. Hart say their candidate -- his plans still up in the air -- isn't going to emphasize the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8, which require an organization to turn out thousands of voters for long sessions on a wintry evening. Instead, Mr. Hart intends to try to make a comeback on Feb. 16 in New Hampshire, the first primary state.    &quot;We'll know after New Hampshire if people respond to Gary,&quot; says Susan Casey, a longtime political aide who helped the former Colorado senator in his New Hampshire campaign four years ago.    But there are so many hurdles to clear. The campaign without a staff faces filing deadlines in 15 states between now and Jan. 15. Texas, for example, with 198 delegates as its prize, requires petitions signed by 5,000 voters by Jan. 4. Each state is different, each one a challenge. And time, for Mr. Hart, is running out.    Not many old Hart hands immediately responded to the call. One exception was Ned Helms, who had gone over to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee after Mr. Hart pulled out of the race. He is now back with Mr. Hart.    Susan Calegari, who was Mr. Hart's New Hampshire campaign director this spring and then switched to former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, says she will remain with Mr. Babbitt. &quot;He's the best candidate in the race,&quot; she says.    Mr. Babbitt himself says, &quot;He'll either be a front-runner or the ghost of Christmas past in a matter of days.&quot; Gov. Dukakis, who is the front-runner in New Hampshire, says, &quot;I intend to beat Gary Hart in New Hampshire.&quot;    Because none of the six other candidates in the race have caught fire so far, the Hart re-entry comes at a critical time. Like it or not, he will be asked to appear in most televised debates and no one can predict the chemistry of that. Some of the Democrats may feel obliged to attack him.    Paul Kirk, the party's national chairman, says he &quot;salutes the six guys who have been there all along.&quot; He says many Democrats will &quot;question the wisdom&quot; of Mr. Hart's decision.    Most troubling to party leaders is the specter of newspapers and TV screens filling up with more revelations about Mr. Hart's personal life, blacking out the very debate Mr. Hart says he wants to prompt.    Almost any way the Hart story plays out, it appears to be more bad news for the Democrats. &quot;Party leaders are now praying for guidance,&quot; said former Democratic chairman John White. &quot;This is a race we ought to win, but we already were off to a poor start. Now here comes Gary Hart and destabilizes everything.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
