DanGlickman, D-Kan., who chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee onwheat, soybeans and feed grains.   At a news conference, he and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, complainedthat current labeling laws allow foods to make claims of ``nocholesterol'' or ``100 percent vegetable shortening'' even thoughthey contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fat.   The American Heart Association, which supports the legislation,says a diet low in saturated fat will help reduce the risk of heartdisease.   The bill would require food labels to disclose nutritioninformation, including saturated fat content by serving, if:   _Packages display a claim about the product's cholesterol contentor say that it was made with vegetable oil.   _Packages do not specifically identify which vegetable oil iscontained in the product. Some labels now show only that a productwas made with any of a variety of oils, including highly saturatedtropical oils like palm and coconut oil.</TEXT></DOC>
