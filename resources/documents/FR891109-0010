The Act created within SBA'sSurety Bond Guarantee (SBG) program a pilot program, which allows SBA toauthorize selected surety companies to issue, monitor and service suretybonds subject to SBA's guarantee without specific prior SBA approval. Thisprogram, unless extended by Congress, is due to end September 30, 1992.Because of the need to move this three-year pilot program forward, therules are again published as ``interim final'' without opportunity forprior public comments.

The 3-yearpilot program instituted under the Act is expected to improve the accessto bonding for small and disadvantaged small business concerns. The inducementto participate is the freedom of designated sureties from the need to seekprior SBA approval for each decision relating to the issuance and administrationof bid and final bonds guaranteed by SBA. The trade-off is a substantiallylower indemnification against losses (70%). In implementation of the Act, SBA published Revision 3 of its SBG regulationson May 8, 1989 (54 FR 19544) as ``interim final'', with a request for comments.Revision 3 attempted to merge the rules for the pilot Preferred SuretyBond (PSB) program with the rules of the pre-existing program (Revision2), published August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32195). Our purpose was to maintaina unified program with uniform rules, to the extent that this is possible,since the purpose of the two programs, and the means to their achievement,are one and the same. The purpose of both programs is stated in the policy section: to assistqualified small business concerns to obtain the required bid, payment andperformance bonds and bonds ancillary thereto, which are unobtainable withoutan SBA guarantee. The older program does so by SBA approval of each bondguarantee on a case-by-case basis, or under a ``bonding line'', which allowsfor a limited number of bond guarantees for a pre-approved contractor withinstrict limitations. The older program was utilized almost exclusively by``specialty'' sureties. The new program will allow sureties selected pursuantto strict principles to issue bonds guaranteed by SBA within stated limits,without prior SBA approval. The two major objectives of the new program are, first, expansion of theparticipation of the standard surety companies, and second, improved accessto surety bonds for small business concerns (Conference Report H.R. 100-1029,100th Cong., 2d Session, October 3, 1988 p. 31).SBA's attempt to formulate a single set of rules was not well received.The trade association representing the major sureties (Surety Associationof America_SAA) expressed the opinion that separate regulations for thePSB program should be developed. Another comment from within SBA, alsorecommended separation of the regulations for the two programs, becausethe format used was considered confusing and it was difficult to ascertainwhat is applicable to each program. Accordingly, the present revision separatesthe rules for the two programs, by dividing the entire regulatory systeminto three subparts. The first subpart contains the rules common to bothprograms, and the other two subparts contain the rules for each of thetwo programs.Another comment pointed out that the ability of PSB companies to writebonds also under the prior-approved program was susceptible to adverserisk selection; a surety might write the riskiest bonds under the prior-approvalprogram, because of its greater loss guarantee (90% or 80% <T3>vs </T3>70%). Accordingly, the present revision prohibits a suretyadmitted to the PSB program from also utilizing the prior-approval program.The following comments explain the substantive changes made in Revision4 from the prior Revision 3. For sections which have not been substantivelychanged from Revision 3, reference is made to the explanations given forRevision 2 (53 FR 32195; August 24, 1988) and Revision 3 (54 FR 19544;May 8, 1989)A new andSection; 115.1 explains the division of the SBG regulations (part115) into three subparts. Subpart A contains regulations generally applicableto the SBG program. Subpart B deals with the (pre-existing) prior-approvalprogram. Subpart C regulates the PSB program.The paragraph dealing with the selection principles for the PSB program,now andSection; 115.10(d), states a lower Treasury underwriting limitationthan before ($1,250,000 vs. $2,500,000). Many comments pointed out thatthe $2.5 million limit excluded too many long-time participants in theSBG program from opting for PSB status. Others stressed the program itselfwas limited to contracts up to $1,250,000, so that the higher underwritinglimit of the regulation bore no immediate relation to the SBG program limit.SBA now adopts the program limit, although it is hoped that contractorswho ``graduate'' from the SBG program will be able to stay with the suretycompanies which brought them to ``graduation'', beyond the $1,250,000 ceiling.The requirement that a PSB charge no more than the SAA advisory rates (andSection;115.10(d)(2)) came under criticism. It was pointed out that three states(CA, KY, IL) prohibited the promulgation of advisory rates, and that thenumber of such states may grow. SBA is not concerned with the legalityof these rates in the various states, but adopts them without regard thereto,because our experience has been that these rates protect the interestsof small concerns without putting the surety at a disadvantage. In fact,certain present participants in the SBG program now use rates lower thanSAA rates for some bond categories.A new requirement has been added (andSection; 115.10(d)(3)). Guaranteed contactbonds may not exceed one-quarter of the PSB surety's total ``book'' ofcontract bond business. This requirement replaces former andSection; 115.3(e)(3).The requirement that the PSB surety's underwriters, as a group, write atleast 25% of their bonds outside the SBG progam, came under criticism becauseit tended to stifle the formation of small-business specialists. The purposeof the former and of the new requirement is the same: to obtain experiencedunderwriting, not influenced by the awareness of the government guarantee.The requirements of in-house underwriting (formerly andSection; 115.3(e)(3))and claims handling (formerly andSection; 115.3(e)(4)) were criticized, becausesureties commonly delegate some of these functions to branch offices. Accordingly,andSection; 115.10(d) (4) and (5) now require that underwriting and claimssettlement must be handled by employees of the surety, not necessarilyin the home office. This requirement does not preclude business productionby independent agents, and claims handling by independent counsel and consultants,selected by employees of the surety company, so long as the ultimate decisionis reserved to the employees of the surety.As pointed out above, andSection; 115.10(f) now limits PSB participants toPSB bonds, to preclude adverse risk selection, <T3>i.e., </T3>in the words of one comment, ``to `dump bad business' intothe [prior-approval] program and thus to `raid the Treasury'.'' Section 115.10(g), formerly andSection; 115.3(f), limits SBA's guaranteeto bonds issued before contract work has begun. The definition of workstart (any action which exposes the surety to liability) was criticizedas overbroad because, it was said, such liability can begin without thesurety's or the obligee's knowledge, for example, when the contractor ordersmaterials before the bond is issued, to lock in a good price. Accordingly,the definition now limits work start to actions on the job site.The definition of ``Account of Contract'' in the definition section, andSection;115.11, (formerly andSection; 115.4) was criticized as omitting multi-yearservice and supply contracts. Accordingly, the definition now providesthat such contracts are eligible so long as the surety's exposure in anyone year does not exceed the statutory limit of $1,250,000.The definition of ``bid bond'' limited the duration of the bid bond guaranteeto 120 days unless SBA and surety agree otherwise. Our purpose was to safeguardour control over the use of our program level authority, since we mustreserve an appropriate amount against bid bonds. A comment pointed outthat sometimes a bid invitation is extended at the last moment, leavingno time to seek SBA approval. Accordingly, the definition now providesthat the surety notify SBA in timely fashion of such extension, but neednot seek approval.The definition of ``bid bond'' now omits the prohibition of forfeiturebonds. That prohibition has been moved to andSection; 115.33, where it continuesto apply to prior-approval sureties. It is inappropriate to the PSB program,since it is an underwriting matter not subject to SBA's review.A new definition, ``Loss under ancillary bond'' limits SBA's guaranteeto a covered loss occuring under the guaranteed contract. This definitionwas judged necessary because ancillary bonds are sometimes term bonds,useable on unbonded contracts subsequent to the bonded contract for whichthey were issued.The definition of ``loss from litigation cost'' was criticized. The definitionrequired prior SBA approval for suits brought by a surety against a UnitedStates department or agency. The reason is obvious: in these cases theU.S. Government would pay for the litigation cost of both sides. It isrecognized, however, that some such suits may be necessary for severalreasons, such as the effect on the interests of indemnitors or guarantors.Accordingly, SBA reserves to itself the judgment on the necessity of suchsuits, and pledges that its approval will not be unreasonably withheld.In the definition of ``Loss from attorney's fees and damages'' the words,``or any other person'', present in Rev. 2 and inadvertently omitted inRev. 3 have been restored, because tort suits against a surety can be broughtnot only by a principal, but also by any other claimant. The reason forthis exclusion is the fact that, under the statute, SBA may only indemnifya surety for losses ``resulting from a breach of the terms of a * * * bond* * * by a principal'' (15 U.S.C. 694b(a)).The definition of ``obligee'' has been expanded to include the so-called``dual obligee savings clause.'' That clause binds a co-obligee to thesurety as completion contractor, as well as to the principal. Otherwisethe bond would become a completion bond, since the co-obligee would notbe bound to pay for completion by the surety. This savings clause has longbeen recognized by SBA in its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) 50-45,par. 10.A new definition for ``Person'' as a natural person or legal entity hasbeen added.The definition of ``Regulatory Violation'' in andSection; 115.13 (formerlyandSection; 115.16), Defenses of SBA, has been clarified in response to acomment which found the prior definition in terms of exposure of SBA toovague. The definition now speaks in terms of an increase in SBA's bondliability by more than 25% or $50,000, whichever is less.A comment criticized the general part of former andSection; 115.7(a), nowandSection; 115.30(a). It was stated that the ``deemed'' certification ofreasonableness of risk imposed an undue burden on the surety, and providedlittle guidance. We note that these words, and the others in the same paragraph,are taken from the statute, where they form the basis for the guarantee(See andSection; 202 of Pub. L. 100-590, 15 U.S.C. 694b(a)(4)). Similar wordshave been in earlier Revisions, see for example, 13 CFR andSection; 115.6(a)(1),Edition as of Jan. 1, 1988. To our knowledge, these words have not causedproblems.A clarification has been added to the indemnification paragraph, andSection;115.30(c), formerly andSection; 115.3(d). It now states expressly that afinal bond initially for a contract amount of less than $100,000 may increasebeyond that amount without reduction in the guarantee percentge (90%),if the bond guarantee is issued on behalf of a disadvantaged small concern.It also makes clear that if a bond for a contract amount of less than $100,000issued on behalf of a principal which is not disadvantaged subsequentlyincreases beyond $100,000, the percentage will decrease from 90% by onepercent for each $5,000 or for any part of a $5,000 increment, but willnot decrease below 80%. Conversely, it also makes clear that bonds forcontracts over $100,000 issued on behalf of small concerns which are notdisadvantaged will be guaranteed up to the administrative ceiling of 80%.In andSection; 115.31 (formerly andSection; 115.8), paragraph (c) has beenamended to make clear that SBA requires the principal's or the surety'sown check for the principal's guarantee fee with the notice from the suretyof the issuance of final bonds. This change from the earlier wording isintended to make clear that the surety is not responsible for the clearanceof the principal's check, and may submit its own check if it so desires.The reason for this provision is the difficulty SBA sometimes experiencesin collecting a principal's guarantee fee, since SBA is not in privitywith the principal, whereas the surety is in privity. A new paragraph has been added to andSection; 115.32 (formerly andSection;115.9). That paragraph requires sureties to obtain status reports frombond obligees, which are not to be forwarded to SBA. This new requirementwas suggested by the General Accounting Office, an arm of the U.S. Congress,in the course of its review of the SBG program, to enable sureties betterto monitor progress under the bonded contract. Most sureties obtain suchreports now, but the practice is not as general as it should be. A change in andSection; 115.34 (formerly andSection; 115.11) relaxes the conditionof reinstatement of a principal after default. Paragraph (a)(1) previouslyrequired that a principal indemnify its surety for at least half its lossin cash, with a note for the balance. It now leaves the percentage of indemnificationto the surety's discretion. Section 115.35(c) (formerly andSection; 115.12(c)), SBA charge to surety,now prescribes a uniform 20% share of the bond premium as SBA's guaranteefee from the surety. Several comments had sharply criticized the formerdual computation of either 20% or a flat dollar fee per thousand dollarsof bond or contract amount. The comments called it ``an accounting nightmare''and an ``opportunity for error.'' Accordingly, SBA has omitted the flatdollar rate altogether, and adopted a 20% premium share across the board.Section 115.35(c) has been further amended by the insertion of a <T3>de minimis </T3>provision. Adjustments up or down in SBA's premiumshare or the principal's guarantee fee may be disregarded if such fee adjustmentamounts to less than forty dollars. The reason for this change is costeffectiveness. It must be noted, however, that no such cost effectivenessconsiderations apply to andSection; 115.13 where the statute requires a materialbreach and a substantial violation to justify a denial of liability. Foran explanation of the requirement concerning the principal's guaranteefee, see comment on andSection; 115.31. A series of questions were raised regarding andSection; 115.37(b)(1) (formerlyandSection; 115.14(b)(1)). The questions and their answers are provided asfollows: (Q) Does the ``imminent breach'' regulation concern itself onlywith financing of the principal? (A) Any measure to forestall a breach(<T3>e.g. </T3>surety pays for accountant or engineer) qualifies under thisprovision. (Q) Does the surety apply for approval of preventive expendituresbefore or after they are made? (A) Before. (Q) Why do the regulations differin this regard for non-PSB and PSB sureties? (A) Because the principleunderlying the PSB program is to let a PSB surety act without case-by-caseSBA approval. A PSB surety takes responsibility for all its servicing decisions,including this one. (Q) Can SBA react quickly enough to approve a surety'srequest for indemnification? (A) We expect that we can give telephone approval(See andSection; 115.31(a)) from one business day to the next. (Q) On whatcriteria does SBA determine that a breach is imminent? (A) The Determinationmust remain committed to SBA judgment, since circumstances vary from caseto case. Generally speaking, we expect that SBA will follow the surety'sand the principal's lead since the prevention of a breach should cost muchless than a default. The provision concerning business integrity of the surety, andSection; 115.39(b)(formerly andSection; 115.17(b)) has been amended to emphasize that the eventsdestroying the presumption of good character are themselves only presumptivelydestructive, and can be rebutted by appropriate evidence. For example,a license revocation can be explained by an inadvertent late fee paymentwhich has since been paid and the license restored. In andSection; 115.60(a), Procedures for PSB (formerly andSection; 115.6(a)),the criterion of geographic diversification has been omitted. SBA had assumedthat PSB sureties would do business throughout the country. A well takencomment, however, pointed out that reinsurers do not have such a requirement.Single state and regional sureties are often more successful than nationalfirms, because of their greater familiarity with their clients and withlocal conditions. Another comment asked whether a bid bond would count against the PSB allotmentby its penal sum or by the estimated contract price (See andSection; 115.60(b),formerly andSection; 115.6(b)). The regulation now provides that the penalsum counts until such time as the SBA bid bond guarantee expires, for example,because the contract has been awarded or the bid withdrawn. Section 115.60(c)(2) (formerly andSection; 115.6(c)) has been amended bythe addition of a sentence requiring PSB sureties to obtain status reportsfrom obligees. While SBA believes that this practice is the custom of thesurety industry, the requirement matches a similar requirement in andSection;115.32(b). A former paragraph, andSection; 115.6(c)(5) requiring prior SBA approvalfor compromise settlements with indemnitors or guarantors, and of liquidationplans for debtor small concerns, came under criticism as both cumbersomeand contrary to the principle of the PSB program entrusting all servicingdecisions to the PSB surety. In response, SBA has omitted such requirementsform this revision. The remaining paragraphs (3) through (6) of andSection; 115.60(c) (formerlyandSection; 115.6(c)(3) through (4)) have been rewritten in response to commentsthereon. These paragraphs now require SBA notification of all bid and finalbonds with SBA guarantees and all changes thereto, by means of a monthlybordereau. Premiums, loss and recovery shares will be passed back and forthbetween SBA and PSB sureties in the normal course of business. Increasesand decreases in bond liability of 25% or $50,000, whichever is less, requireadjustment both in the principal's guarantee fee and in SBA's premium share,but changes of less than $40 are to be disregarded. Increases in bond liabilitymust fit within the PSB surety's allotment for the period during whichthe PSB surety consents to such increase. When a principal defaults oris reinstated after default, SBA is to be notified within 30 calendar daysirrespective of bordereau periods. SBA's purpose here is to prevent a defaultedcontractor from seeking SBA-guaranteed bonds from other sureties, and toenable it to restore bonding capability when warranted. Section 115.61(a), formerly andSection; 115.15, now requires submission ofclaims for losses within one year from disbursement, but no longer requiresthe submission of the bonded contract, consistent with the principle thatPSB sureties participating in the PSB program are not subject to case-by-caseapproval from SBA.For the same reason, the requirement for semi-annual status reports hasbeen omitted.Section 115.61(b) Imminent breach formerly was andSection; 115.14(b)(2),and remains substantively unchanged (See comments on andSection; 115.37(b).Section 115.62(a) (formerly andSection; 115.17(a)) has been amended to comparePSB surety bond practice with those of other PSB sureties, as more stringentcriteria are applicable to PSB sureties.Section 115.61(b), formerly andSection; 115.17(b), has been amended in conformitywith andSection; 115.39(b), to make clear that the stated events destroyingthe presumption of good character are themselves only presumptively destructive,and therefore rebuttable.A new section, andSection; 115.64, not contained in earlier revisions, hasbeen added in response to comments on former andSection; 115.10(b). Thatparagraph stated that SBA would determine the eligibility of PSB bondsfor an SBA guarantee at the time a claim for loss under such bond is received.This point in time seemed to us to be the first when SBA had knowledgeof the PSB bond, and became able to review such PSB bond's conformity withSBA's authorizing statute. The provision, however, was termed as ``totallyunacceptable'' by SAA. Accordingly, SBA has attempted to formulate the13 grounds for denials of liability which have become manifest in the pastand which are applicable to the PSB program. It should be noted, however,that the statute lists SBA's defenses (See andSection; 115.13 and andSection;411(e) of the Small Business Investment Act, as amended by Section 203(c)of the Act). These statutory defenses are available, whether or not repeatedin the regulation. Accordingly, the grounds for denial of liability recitedin this section cannot be taken as definitive or comprehensive. In thisconnection, we point out that in the last sixteen years, less than fiftydenials of liability have occurred, and that each denial requires approvalfrom the highest level of SBA. The first four grounds are statutory. Thefifth ground would exist if the bonded contract represents a financialguarantee, such as if the principal's payments to the obligee are bonded.The sixth ground exists if an agent mistakenly issues a guaranteed bondin the name of a surety other than the one which has agreed to issue it.The seventh to eleventh grounds are explicitly stated in these regulations.The twelfth ground exists, for example, if the surety suffers a loss asa result of a ``bad faith'' practice.The last ground would exist if an ancillary bond, <T3>e.g., </T3>for taxes or union benefits, issued as a term bond ratherthan a job bond results in a loss on a job for which SBA had not issueda bond guarantee.<ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance with Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct and the Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>For purposes of Executive Order 12291, SBA has determined that these rulesare major since they restructure a program with a program level of $1.25billion.SBA certifies that these rules do not warrant the preparation of a FederalAssessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, SBA has determinedthat these rules will have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.The following analysis is provided within the context of the review requiredunder Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603):These rules are necessary to implement the Preferred Surety Bond GuaranteeProgram Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-590, Title II approved November 3, 1988(102 Stat. 3007). This Act created within SBA's existing Surety Bond Guaranteeprogram a new program under which SBA may authorize selected sureties ``withoutfurther administration approval, to issue, monitor, and service such bondssubject to the Administration's guarantee.''It is therefore necessary to set forth how such sureties will be selectedto issue SBA guarantees on SBA's behalf without prior SBA approval, howthey would operate to meet SBA's requirement under the statute and theregulations, how SBA would regulate, audit and, if necessary, terminatethe PSB status of such sureties. At the same time, it is necessary to restructurethe existing regulatory system to accommodate a two-track surety bond guaranteeprogram.The change in andSection; 115.35(c), SBA charge to surety, was made becauseone of the prior computations of a guarantee fee, a flat dollar amount,had been criticized as a potential fairness problem, given the increasingdiversity of premium rates. We believe that the present system will avoidsuch results.We believe that the new statute and these regulations will result in lowerbonding costs and better availability of bonds for small concerns, becausethe expected entry into the SBG program of major industry members withtheir wide organizational network, at premiums which do not exceed theSurety Association of America's advisory rates, will make more bonds atlower cost available to the small business market. It should be noted thatthe PSB represents a trade-off. PSB sureties accept a lower indemnificationrate against their losses, and sometimes lower premiums, in return forthe privilege of protecting their bonds with the SBA guarantee without``second-guessing'' by SBA. However, given the finite guarantee authorityfor SBA, it is conceivable that over time a market shift away from SBA'straditional participants towards the new SBG entrants could occur, althoughwe do not think so. SBA's increased bonding authority, together with thetrade-off discussed above, should combine to prevent a detriment to ourtraditional partners.SBA is not aware of any suitable alternatives to the rules here set forth.Because of the short life of this pilot program, as explained in the Summary,these rules are published as interim final, with a request for comments.There are no reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirementsnot approved by the Office of Management and Budget which would come underthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 35.There are no federal rules which duplicate, overlap or conflict with theserules.The legal authority for these rule changes is section 5(b)(6) of the SmallBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6), section 308(c) of the Small BusinessInvestment Act, 15 U.S.C. 687(c), and section 411(d) of that Act, 15 U.S.C.694(b)(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 115</ITAG>Small business, Surety bonds.Pursuant to the authority contained in section 411(d) of title IV, partB, Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 694(b)(d))and in section 203 of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program Act of1988, Pub.

Consequently, Congress has authorized SBA to guaranteeon a prudent and economically justifiable basis (upon such terms and conditionsas SBA may prescribe) sureties participating in the Surety Bond Guarantee(SBG) program, against a part of their losses incurred as a result of aprincipal's breach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, performancebond, or bonds which are ancillary to such bonds, on any contract not exceeding$1,250,000 in face value. Congress has further authorized SBA to empowerselected sureties, without further SBA, approval, to issue, monitor, andservice such bonds, subject to SBA's guarantee. This latter program ishereafter referred to as the Preferred Surety Bond Program (PSB).(b) <T3>Types of bonds.</T3> The Administration has determined that only bid,performance, and payment bonds (other than bonds in the nature of a financialguarantee) issued in connection with a contract and of a type listed inthe ``Contract Bonds'' section of the current Rating Manual of the SuretyAssociation of America \1\<NOTE/> will be eligible for an SBA guarantee. In addition, the SBAguarantee may be extended to such ancillary bonds as are incidental tothe contract and essential for its performance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey 08830.(c) <T3>Guarantee agreement.</T3> A surety company participating in this programshall be listed by the U.S. Treasury as eligible to issue bonds in connectionwith Federal procurement contracts, and be a corporation determined bySBA to be a surety eligible to participate in this program. The terms andconditions of SBA's bond guarantee agreements may vary from surety to surety,depending on SBA's experience with a particular surety. Where the statutedoes not mandate the division of losses, the Office of Surety Guaranteeswill consider, by way of example and not of limitation, surety's loss ratein this program in comparison with other sureties participating with SBAto a comparable degree, the rating or ranking designation assigned to thesurety by recognized authority, the average contract amount or bond penaltyper bond written in this program and the ratio of bid bonds to final bondswritten in this program.(d) <T3>Selection of sureties for the PSB program.</T3> SBA's selection ofsureties empowered to issue, monitor and service bonds subject to SBA'sguarantee without prior SBA approval will be guided by, but not limitedto, these factors:(1) An underwriting limitation of at least one and one-quarter milliondollars ($1,250,000) on the U.S. Treasury Department list of acceptablesureties;(2) An agreement to charge small concerns bonded under PSB no more thanthe advisory premium rates of the Surety Association of America, whetheror not such rates are approved in or accepted by the relevant jurisdiction;(3) Premium income from contract bonds guaranteed by any government agency(Federal, State or local) does not exceed one-quarter of the total contractbond premium income of the surety;(4) Underwriting authority for SBA-guaranteed bonds is vested only in employeesof the surety company;(5) Final settlement authority for claims under the PSB program is vestedin employees of a PSB surety's permanent claims department satisfactoryto SBA;(6) Number of bid and final contract bonds issued by the surety from yearto year for the last five fiscal years;(7) The rating or ranking designations assigned to the surety by recognizedauthority.(e) <T3>Duration of PSB program. </T3>The PSB program shall terminate on September30, 1992, unless extended by Act of Congress. SBA guarantees effectiveunder this program on or before September 30, 1992, shall remain in effectafter such date.(f) <T3>Participation in PSB program. </T3>A surety authorized to issue, monitor,and service surety bonds subject to SBA's guarantee without obtaining priorSBA approval, shall not be eligible to submit applications under subpartB.(g) <T3>Timeliness. </T3>(1) SBA's guarantee of a bond will be honored onlyif issued before the work under the contract has begun. To establish theexact bond issuance date, a surety shall maintain a contemporaneous recordof the issuance of each bond (OMB Approval No. 3245-0007).(2) For purposes of this paragraph (g), work on a job shall be consideredas having begun when a contractor takes any action at the job site whichexposes its surety to liability under applicable law.(3) SBA may guarantee a bond issued after work on the contract has begun,but only by the signature on Form 991 (OMB No. 3245-0007) of an SBA officialhaving delegated authority to approve contract amounts such as underliethe bond in question (see andSection; 101.3-2, Part III(c) of this chapter),upon receipt of all of the following from the surety:(i) Evidence (certified copy of contract or sworn affidavit) from the principalthat the surety bond requirement was contained in the original job contract,or documentation satisfactory to SBA, as to why a surety bond was not previouslysecured and is now being required.(ii) A certification by the principal listing all suppliers and indicatingthat they are paid to date, attaching a waiver of lien from each; thatall taxes and labor costs are current; that all subcontractors are paidto their current status of work and a waiver of lien from each, or an explanationsatisfactory to SBA why such documentation cannot be produced.(iii) A certification by obligee that all payments due under the contractto present status have been made and that the job has been satisfactorilycompleted to present status.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 115.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>This section includes terms defined at 15 U.S.C. 694a and provides definitionsof other terms.<T3>Affiliate </T3>is defined in andSection; 121.3(a) of this chapter.<T3>Amount of contract. </T3>The amount of the contract to be bonded shallbe established as of the time of issuance of the executed and guaranteedbond or bonds.
