Becauseof the nature of those comments, nearly all of which disagreed with theneed for procedures of appeals, a decision has been made not to go forwardwith final issuance of the proposed regulations in Part 340 until furtherstudy of the issues and options has taken place. Agency and union comments on Part 752 are itemized in the sections below,and decisions on the final regulations are noted and explained. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 752: Adverse Actions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Regulatory Requirements for Suspension for 14 Days or Less</ITAG>Section 752.201 Coverage.<T3>Comment: </T3>A union stated its belief that the definition of ``currentcontinuous employment'' (which called for a period of employment ``withouta break of a workday'') would mean that an employee who had completed aprobationary period and who was then even 1 day in a nonpay status wouldnot be covered by these procedures. The same commenter felt that the definitionof ``same or similar positions'' would unduly deprive any competitive serviceemployees of procedural protections if they had changed jobs to ones withdifferent requirements. An agency recommended that OPM add the word ``substantially''before the words ``the same qualifications'' in the definition of ``sameor similar positions.'' This would permit positions with minor differencesin qualification requirements to be still considered similar positionsfor determining whether an employee had met the requirements for currentcontinuous service. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM realizes that the law providing coverage for employeesin the competitive service is somewhat confusing and not self-explanatory.The confusion arises because there are employees in the competitive servicewho serve in two types of appointments. The majority serve under career,career-conditional, or certain other nontemporary appointments which requirea probationary or trial period of service. Of this group, only those employeeswho have yet to complete the necessary probationary or trail period (requiredeither because their current appointment is their first period of Governmentservices, or because they have been appointed from a register to a differentposition) are excluded from Part 752 protections. Once they complete thecurrent probationary period, they do not have to serve another probationaryperiod, even after a break in Government service, unless they are againappointed from a register. (See 5 CFR Part 315.) The definitions of ``currentcontinuous employment'' and ``similar positions'' do not apply to thisgroup. A much smaller group of competitive service employees serve in appointments(such as temporary appointments pending establishment of a register (TAPER),<T3>status quo</T3>, or special tenure appointments) which require no probationaryor trial period. It is this second group of employees to which our regulatorydefinitions are addressed. The law (5 U.S.C. 7501) intended to providefor coverage of this second group once the employees have completed oneyear of current <T3>continuous </T3>employment in the same or similar positions. It wasnot intended to require that all employees in the competitive service,including those who have completed the necessary probation or trial period,meet the one year of current continuous employment requirement. To make it clearer what the law means, OPM is revising the statements ofemployees covered and employees excluded to show which groups are coveredand which are not. OPM is also revising the definition of ``current continuousemployment'' to show that continuous employment means employment withouta break in Federal civilian service. Time in a leave or nonduty, nonpaystauts counts toward completion of the period of current continuous employmentfor adverse action purposes. In addition, OPM agrees with the commentersthat the definition of ``similar positions,'' a term introduced in statutein lieu of the pre-CSRA term ``same line of work,'' may be too narrow,and is revising it to reflect that the duties and qualifications for thepositions are close enough so that the incumbent could be readily interchangedbetween the two positions without undue interruption. Section 752.203(d) Representation. <T3>Comments: </T3>Three unions asked why OPM deleted the statement inthe current regulation which states that employees covered by the termsof the negotiated agreement are governed by its terms and by 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5)for representation purposes. One of these commenters believed such a changewould deny employees any right to representation. Another stated that thischange strikes language favoring union representation of such employees.<T3>Response: </T3>OPM continues to believe that the deleted language wasmisplaced in this section and could be read incorrectly to narrow representationalrights for employees against whom a suspension of 14 days or less is proposed.5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) applies to representation during grievances and appeals.By its citation of this section, the current regulation could be read tomean that bargaining unit employees may only be represented by their unionrepresentatives after an adverse action is proposed. However, under 5 U.S.C.7503(b)(3), all employees against whom such a suspension is proposed havethe right to ``an attorney or other representative'' (which of course caninclude a union representative). Therefore, the employee may choose a representativeof his or her choice in responding to an agency's proposal to suspend.Because 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) does apply to representation of employees coveredby a negotiated bargaining agreement for the purposes of challenging (i.e.,grieving) an agency's action, OPM is deleting reference to 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5)in this section and adding to a new andSection; 752.203(f) on grievance rightsunder this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="84">Supbart D_Regulatory Requirements for Removal, Suspension for MoreThan 14 Days, Reduction in Pay, or Furlough for 30 Days or Less </ITAG>Section 752.401(a) Adverse actions covered. <T3>Comments: </T3>One union recommended that the regulation not be revisedto reflect the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitin <T3>Lovshin </T3>v. <T3>Department of the Navy, </T3>767 F.2d 834 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>106 S. Ct. 1623 (1986), that performance-based actionsmay be taken under the procedures of Chapter 75. The union stated thatthe case was untested and could be overturned. It also opined that allowingperformance actions to be taken under Part 752 would violate the meritprinciple in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(6) requiring an opportunity to correct performanceprior to removal. <T3>Response: </T3>While the regulatory change does reflect <T3>Lovshin, </T3>it is also consistent with OPM's position that Part 752is available for taking performance-based actions if the agency can meetthe standard of ``such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service''and can prove its case under the preponderance of the evidence standardrequired for actions taken under this part. This position is reflectedin the final regulation which does not restrict or qualify an agency'sauthority to use Part 752 for taking performance-based adverse actions.Further, the <T3>Lovshin </T3>case has been tested as evidenced by the Supreme Court'srefusal to overturn the lower court's earlier decision which was decidedby a full panel of judges. Section 752.401(b) Actions excluded.<T3>Comments on paragraph (b)(7): </T3>A union commented that OPM shouldnot say that the termination of a temporary or term promotion is not anadverse action, since OPM and MSPB had agreed that if a promotion weretemporary the employee would be given Part 752 rights if the promotionlasted more than a specific period of time (two years). The union believesthat the decision cited by OPM in its proposal_<T3>Phipps </T3>v. <T3>Department of Health and Human Services, </T3>767 F.2d 895 (Fed. Cir.1985)_is not well-established and should be very narrowly interpreted.An agency stated its belief that the intent of the <T3>Phipps </T3>decision went beyond temporary promotions in the competitiveservice and that unless OPM specifies that this section of the regulationsapplies also to excepted service employees, agencies with employees inthe excepted service would be required to go through with needless ritualsof adverse actions whenever a clearly temporary promotion extended beyondthe times set in current Part 752. A second agency recommended that OPMmake it clear that such a termination of a promotion would only be excludedif the employee was informed in advance of the temporariness of the promotion.<T3>Response: </T3>With respect to the union's comments, OPM, notes thatthe original appeal right was a creation of the Civil Service Commissionand was not dictated nor reinforced by judicial decisions. OPM also notesthat MSPB has affirmed and applied the <T3>Phipps </T3>decision in <T3>Mosley </T3>v. <T3>Department of the Navy, </T3>MSPB Dkt. No. PH07528510766 (1986). Withrespect to the comment that <T3>Phipps </T3>should be applied beyond temporary promotions in the competitiveservice and also cover all returns from clearly temporary promotions, OPMagrees that nothing in <T3>Phipps </T3>indicated that it was intended to cover only returns fromtemporary promotions in the competitive service. In OPM's current regulationson temporary promotions, in fact, the language covers all returns fromtemporary promotions. It is OPM's intent that the exclusion of the returnfrom all promotions of a temporary nature cover both competitive and exceptedservice employees. Accordingly, this recommended change has been made.With respect to informing the employee of the temporariness of a promotionbefore it takes place, OPM agrees that the employee should be on noticethat the promotion is to be temporary, and has made the recommended change.<T3>Recommendation of a new exclusion: </T3>An agency has recommended thatOPM add a specific exclusion of the reduction in grade of employees whoare granted pay retention under 10 U.S.C. 1586. Employees of military departmentswho sign rotation agreements under this section of law have restorationrights to their former positions upon return from overseas assignments.If the agency cannot restore an employee to his or her former grade, itwill assign the employee to a lower grade but with retained pay. <T3>Comment: </T3>Currently, OPM's regulations only exclude actions whichentitle employees to <T3>grade </T3>retention. OPM believes this very specific exclusion isbetter not expanded to cover situations when pay, but not grade retentionis granted because each pay retention situation must be reviewed on itsmerits to determine if adverse action procedures are appropriate, i.e.,because of a reduction in the rate of base pay previously paid to the employee.In addition, and as the agency pointed out, the MSPB ruled in <T3>Fromer </T3>v. <T3>DOD, </T3>29 M.S.P.R. 481 (1985) that an employee who received thebenefit of pay retention under 10 U.S.C. 1586 is not entitled to the proceduraland appellate rights of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75. Thus, the MSPB decision willbe available to serve as precedent in future cases covered by 10 U.S.C.1586. Section 752.401(d) Employees excluded. <T3>Comments: </T3>A union asked why OPM omitted Presidential appointees.<T3>Response: </T3>Since the statute specifically excludes such employeesfrom coverage of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, OPM considered that there was nonecessity to exclude them by regulation. Nevertheless, because of the considerablecomplexity of coverage and exclusion, OPM has revised this subsection toclarify which employees the law <T3>excludes, </T3>including Presidential appointees. (OPM has also revised5 CFR 752.401(c) to spell out which employees the law <T3>includes.</T3>) Section 752.402 Definitions. <T3>Comments on Subsection (b), Current continuous employment and (g),Same or similar positions: </T3>The comments on these definitions werethe same as those on 5 CFR 752.201. <T3>Response: </T3>See OPM's response to the above comments. <T3>Comments on Subsection (e), Indefinite suspension: </T3>One union questionedOPM's authority to regulate indefinite suspensions. <T3>Response: </T3>Indefinite suspensions, which have been in use for manyyears, are provided for in FPM Chapter 752 and were covered in earlierFPM supplemental material. They have also been sanctioned by the courts(e.g., <T3>Jankowitz </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>533 F.2d 538 (Ct.Cl. 1976), and <T3>Wiemers </T3>v. <T3>Merit Systems Protection Board. </T3>792 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985),(pending criminal proceedings); and <T3>Thomas </T3>v. <T3>General Services Administration, </T3>756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985),pending inquiry)). As a form of suspension, they are within OPM's authorityto regulate under 5 U.S.C. 7514. OPM's definition covers both indefinitesuspensions during criminal proceedings and subsequent actions, with ashortened notice period under the ``crime provision'' in section 7513(b)(1),or during agency investigation or inquiry, with the usual 30-day noticerequired by that section.<T3>Comments on Subsection (h), Suspension: </T3>Several agencies alsoquestioned the inclusion of enforced leave as a form of suspension, somebecause of the uncertain state of the case law and others because the inclusionof periods of annual and sick leave as suspensions seems to contradictthe statute's definition of suspension as being in a <T3>nonpay</T3> status. (5 U.S.C. 7501(2).)<T3>Response: </T3>MSPB and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitindicated earlier the involuntary placement of an employee in a leave statusfor more than 14 days does in some instances constitute a constructivesuspension and thus an appealable adverse action. OPM's proposed regulationsreflected these holdings. More recently, the Federal Circuit expanded onthe earlier case law and held that indefinite periods of enforced leaveand periods of enforced leave of more than 14 days constitute appealableadverse actions. (<T3>Pittman</T3> v. <T3>MSPB,</T3> No. 87-3215 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 4, 1987).)Although OPM agrees that including periods of paid leave in the definitionof suspension would be inconsistent with the definition of suspension in5 U.S.C. 7501(2) (and has not done so in the final regulations), agenciesmust be aware that if they choose to use indefinite periods of enforcedleave or enforced leave of more than 14 days, they should follow Part 752adverse action procedures to propose and effect the action, and give theemployee appropriate notice of appeal rights, or face the possibility thata third party will reverse their action of the basis of harmful proceduralerror.Section 752.404 Procedures.<T3>Comments on Subsection 752.404(b), Notice of proposed action: </T3>Anagency recommended that OPM revise paragraph (3) to allow agencies thediscretion to choose among alternatives when they determine that an employeecannot be kept at the worksite during the notice period of an adverse action.One agency recommended that OPM not delete current subparagraph (3)(iii)in light of the MSPB's earlier decision in <T3>Pittman. </T3>Another agency suggested that OPM clarify proposed subparagraph(3)(iii) to distinguish it from current subparagraph (3)(ii) since bothof these concern situations where the employee may be absent from the agencyduring the notice period. Finally, an agency recommended broadened languagein subparagraph (3)(v) to allow agencies to place employees in paid, nondutystatus before as well as during the advance notice period.<T3>Response: </T3> OPM agrees that agencies should have the choice ofalternatives in the unusual times when the employee cannot be allowed tostay at the worksite because his or her continued presence could pose athreat to the employee or others, result in lost or damaged Governmentproperty, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests. Thus,OPM has revised the subsection to allow agencies to select among the alternatives,rather than considering them in sequential order.With respect to the current provision allowing the employee to be placedon enforced leave during the notice period when the agency has medicaldocumentation demonstrating physical or mental incapacitation, OPM believesthat the use of enforced leave during the notice period would be a constructivesuspension under the Federal Circuit's decision in <T3>Pittman</T3> (see above) and has implemented the proposed deletionof this provision.In regard to two paragraphs dealing with situations where the employeeis absent from the agency (that is, when the employee has requested leave,or when he or she is absent for reasons not originating with the agency,such as incarceration), OPM has merged these two paragraphs to show thatthese are both situations where the employee's absence from the worksitecan be charged to an appropriate leave category.Finally, OPM has revised subparagraph (3)(v), using language parallel tothat in the crime provision procedures (5 U.S.C. 752.404(d)(1)), to allowagencies more flexibility to place employees in a nonduty, paid statuswhile initiating and effecting an action.<T3>Comments of Paragraph 752.404(d)(1), ``Crime provision'':</T3> An agencynotes that 5 U.S.C. 7513(b) does not limit the actions covered by it toremoval or indefinite suspension.<T3>Response: </T3>Though the statute does not limit the use of the crimeprovision to specific adverse actions, OPM notes that the whole purposeof the crime provision is to effect the action in a shortened period oftime so that the employee can be removed quickly from the workplace. OPMdoes not believe that an agency could justify the need for such an abbreviationof procedures in the case of a reduction in grade or pay where the employeewill remain at the workplace. OPM does agree, however, that time-specificsuspensions, since they involve the temporary removal of the employee fromthe workplace and placement in a nonduty, nonpay status, may be used asappropriate with the crime provision. Accordingly, the final paragraphhas been changed to cover removals and suspensions, including indefinitesuspensions.<T3>Comments of Subsection (e), Representation: </T3>See comments on proposed5 CFR 752.203(d).<T3>Response: </T3>See OPM's response to comments on proposed 5 CFR 752.303(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulator Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it applies only to Federalemployees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 752</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Part 752 of Title 5 of the Code of FederalRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 752_ADVERSE ACTION</ITAG>1.
