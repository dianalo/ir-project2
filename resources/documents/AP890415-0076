The two-day convention was organized by the Bhopal Women GasVictims Organization, which says the $470 million settlementdecreed by India's highest court is too little.   The government says more than 3,400 people died and at least20,000 were injured when methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a tankat the Bhopal pesticide plant operated by an Indian subisidary ofUnion Carbide Corp., a Danbury, Conn.-based multinational.   ``This convention is the first step to start a mass movement inthe country to fight for the rights of the gas victims,'' saidAbdul Jabbar Khan, an activist who heads the women's group.   He predicted the convention would pass resolutions demanding areview of the settlement and the reopening of the government's $3billion suit against Union Carbide.   On Feb. 14, the high court ordered Union Carbide to pay $470million to settle all claims.   At the convention's opening session, Dr. Sathyamala of theMedico Friends Circle disputed the government's casualty toll forthe disaster. She said statistics collected from burial andcremation grounds indicated at least 20,000 people died fromexposure to the gas that seeped out of the pesticide plant on Dec.3, 1984.   Similar claims have been made before. Given the haste with whichHindu victims were cremated and Moslem victims were buried inkeeping with the tenets of their faiths, the precise number ofdeaths may never be known.   Dr. Sathyamala, who uses only one name, also said Bhopal's birthrate had fallen because people who were exposed to the gas hadconception and sterility problems.   ``The number of births has come down every year from 12,000before the tragedy to just 7,800 now,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
