Parliament approved Uno early in the day, ending the party'sfive-week search for someone unblemished by the scandal, in whichRecruit Co. is accused of trying to buy influence with cut-pricestock and huge campaign donations.   He had been foreign minister and replaces Noboru Takeshita, whoresigned to take responsibility for the scandal.   In a suggestion of a tougher line on trade policy, Uno toldreporters the American use of threats to gain trade concessionsfrom Japan was ``like negotiating with your fists up.''   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said, however, thatthe new administration would practice ``consistency andcontinuity'' in foreign policy.   Uno, 66, said political reform would be his first priority.   His party, in power since it was formed in 1955, has sunk to anall-time low in opinion polls because of the scandal. It needs aboost before elections this summer for half the upper house, butUno's initial appointments were unlikely to provide one.   Ryutaro Hashimoto, his choice for party secretary-general, toldreporters Friday he had received 2.4 million yen ($17,000) in1985-86 from Recruit Co., a data and publishing conglomerate.   His new chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa, said he hadgiven a blank signed receipt to another Liberal Democrat, whodivided a large donation from Recruit among several such receiptsto get around reporting requirements.   Analysts said the appointments indicated a continuation ofTakeshita's policies.   At least six ministers in the 20-member government that Unoinstalled Friday are carry-overs from Takeshita's Cabinet, andseveral others served in previous administrations.   The Cabinet appeared to be carefully balanced among the variousLiberal Democratic factions, despite a reform committee'srecommendation that the faction system be abolished.   Factional divisions within the party, based more on personal andfinancial allegiances than political philosophy, are widely blamedfor creating the competition for funds that led to the scandal.   At a news conference, Uno rejected opposition demands for ageneral election and said: ``As head of the party, I'd like todevote myself entirely to the party and political reforms.''   He said the scandal ``has had a dramatic effect on our party. Iwould like to take this opportunity to reflect on this developmentso we can make a clean start in politics and regain the confidenceof the people.''   Money that party members improperly received from Recruit willbe returned to the people, he said, but did not indicate how thatwould be done.   Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-ratestock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.   Uno is said to have avoided involvement in the scandal, in partbecause he was not an aggressive fundraiser.   Opposition leaders and some Liberal Democrats criticized thechoice of Uno because he belongs to the party faction of formerPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, during whose administration in1982-87 the Recruit scandal developed.   Nakasone has resigned from the party but retained his seat inParliament, and analysts expect his influence to continue.   Uno is from Shiga prefecture in western Japan, where his familyowns a brewery. Stores in Tokyo have begun promoting Uno Honke, afamily brand of rice wine, and report brisk sales.</TEXT></DOC>
