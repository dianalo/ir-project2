These included published government and industry reports, syndicated surveys, student projects, sales interviews and employee focus groups.    Certainly more efficiency in research is a worthy goal. However, it is foolish to be stingy or casual with the market input that directs the strategic investments in a company's business. As one of my colleagues in research and development recently said, &quot;Market research isn't expensive; what's expensive is the hundreds of millions of dollars spent in developing products that people don't want.&quot;    Mr. Rosen's recommendations are appropriate for the exploratory or idea-generation phase of the planning process. At that stage, all kinds of anecdotal or approximate information can help stimulate the creative process. However, once ideas about alternative courses of action are available, the most important role for research emerges, and that is to evaluate and prioritize ideas before committing to action. In order to provide a sound basis for decision making, this evaluative type of research must be disciplined and formal, and therefore higher in cost.    Marketing research is an investment with high returns. The payoff of the thousands of dollars spent in the research phase is that the millions of dollars spent in the development and marketing phase are focused on products and services that the world really wants.    American industry needs the guidance of disciplined marketing research systems to leverage the efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. It's hard to believe most businesses, large or small, are spending too much on this type of activity.    William R. BonDurant   Director, Marketing Information Services   Hewlett-Packard Inc.
