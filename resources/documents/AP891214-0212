The eight major U.S. automakers reported Wednesday their dealerssold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 22,589 during theDec. 1-10 period this year, down 23.7 percent from a rate of 29,610a day during the same time last year.   Car sales were off 27.9 percent and truck sales were down 16.6percent.   ``A year ago, we had some pretty aggressive incentives,'' saidanalyst Doug Laughlin of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. of New York. ``No oneis going to confirm this, but I believe the industry is trying togauge the actual level of demand without incentives to see whatthey can do without throwing out money needlessly.''   Cash rebates and lower-than-bank-loan interest rates have becomepart of car buying. But automakers pay for the incentives out oftheir profits, which were severely dented in 1989.   Chrysler Corp.'s early-December car sales fell by 33.1 percent,Ford Motor Co.'s dropped 30.2 percent and General Motors Corp.'scar sales during the period were off 28.4 percent.   ``These are pretty close to what we've been getting in the lasttwo (selling) periods,'' Laughlin said.   With just 2{ weeks of selling left in 1989, the industryappeared to be heading for the seventh-best year on record, sellingsomewhere around 14.8 million cars and trucks.   Last year's sales of 15.8 million was the second-best inhistory, behind the 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986. Salestotaled 15.5 million in 1987.   So far this year, car and truck sales are running 3.2 percentbehind last year's pace. Car sales are down 4.3 percent and trucksales are off 1.2 percent.   Chrysler said its early-December truck sales were down 16.4percent, combining with car sales for a 25.1 percent decline invehicle sales. Through Dec. 10 of this year, Chrysler's cars andlight trucks were selling at a pace 6.7 percent below last year.   Ford said its 30.2 percent decline in early-December car salesand a 16 percent drop in light truck sales combined for a vehiclesales rate 24.4 percent lower than during the same period last year.   So far this year, Ford's cars and trucks are selling at a rate 3percent below last year's pace.   GM said its combined car and truck sales in early December were23.9 percent lower than they were during the same time last year,as its decline in car sales combined with a 14.9 percent drop inlight truck sales.
