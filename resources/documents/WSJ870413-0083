The launch costs, including satellite and launch insurance and Telesat engineering and program management, will total about $230 million. For competitive reasons, Telesat wouldn't break out the exact value of the contract to Arianespace, the European Space Agency's commercial satellite launching arm.    Telesat operates Canada's satellite communications system. It is jointly owned by the Canadian government and Canadian telephone companies and common carriers.    Ariane rocket launches, as previously reported, have been suspended since last May because of engine problems, and Arianespace officials said last week that new engine problems will further delay efforts to restart the launch program.    Eldon Thompson, Telesat's president and chief executive officer, said Arianespace received the contract based on price, performance, and &quot;favorable terms and conditions.&quot; Competing bids were made by Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md.; General Dynamics Corp., St. Louis; and a Chinese government agency.    Harry Kowalik, Telesat Canada's vice president, space systems, said the Ariane 44P launch vehicle can place a satellite &quot;closer to its final (orbiting) position than any other rocket.&quot;    As previously reported, Telesat's Anik E satellites, the E-1 and E-2, are to be built by Spar Aerospace Ltd., Toronto, for a total of about $138 million (U.S.). When in orbit, the telecommunications satellites will be more powerful than any other currently in service.    Anik E-1 will begin operating within six months of its launch, while Anik E-2 will be put into storage orbit for two years until it is needed. In storage orbit, a satellite circles the earth using gravitational force rather than fuel.    The two Telesat satellites are the first to be launched by Arianespace. Telesat has previously launched nine satellites, all by vehicles of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Once NASA resumes its space shuttle flights, it plans to launch 22 commercial payloads, then intends to withdraw from that business. NASA has suspended launches since the shuttle Challenger exploded in January 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
