JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After a storm of protests from private pilotsand some members of Congress, the government has scaled back itsproposed requirement for small planes to be equipped withaltitude-tracking equipment.   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it wouldrequire small private planes to have altitude-encoding transpondersif they fly near 138 airports and in some cases as far as 30 milesfrom the runway. The devices provide air traffic controllers withaltitude information about a specific plane on their radar screen.   Only four months ago, the FAA said it was consideringregulations that would ban small planes from all airspace within 40miles of 254 airports and above 6,000 feet when not flying near anairport.   The regulation announced Thursday requires the devices on smallplanes within 30 miles of 27 of the nation's busiest airports afterJuly 1989 and within currently restricted airspace _ less than 10miles in some many cases _ surrounding 109 other airports after1990.   Under the rule, small planes would be allowed to fly up to10,000 feet without the equipment, instead of the 6,000 feetsuggested earlier. Currently the altitude-encoding transponders arerequired above 12,500 feet.   The final rule falls short of what the airlines and commercialpilots had wanted but was seen as a significant victory for privatepilots and their powerful lobbying group, the Aircraft Owners andPilots Association.   The February proposal had unleashed a firestorm among thenation's private pilots, who flooded the FAA and congressionaloffices with more than 80,000 complaint letters. Severalcongressmen had threatened legislation forcing the FAA to back off.   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association called therestrictions an ``overzealous'' reaction to concern about aerialcollisions and urged private plane owners across the country to``join ... in opposing the great airspace grab.''   Only last year Congress directed the FAA to expand the use ofthe altitude-encoding equipment, known as Mode-C transponders, insmall planes because of an increasing number of near-collisionreports and the 1986 collision of a small plane and a Mexicanairliner over Cerritos, Calif.   The airlines and commercial pilots have call for stricter rulesfor the use of the altitude-encoding equipment on small planes andfavor such equipment on any plane flying in airspace used bycommercial jetliners.   While the final rule is far less than what the agency suggestedlast February, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said Thursdayevening he expects the new requirements to signficantly reduce thedanger from aerial collisions.   Under the new requirements, small planes must be equip withtransponders that tell controllers the plane's altitude by July 1,1989, or be banned from airspace within 30 miles of the 27 airportsthat are surrounded by so-called Terminal Control Areas, or TCAs.Any aircraft flying within the TCA's already must have the devices.   By the end of 1990 aircraft flying in restricted airspace knownas Airport Radar Service Areas, or ARSAs, must have the equipment.The ARSAs vary in size but generally are much smaller than theairspace envisioned by the February proposal.   The FAA also said certain ``designated'' airports that havecommecial air traffic but no currently restricted airspace wouldnot be opened for small planes without Mode-C transponders after1990. So far only two such airports have been designated _Billings, Mont., and Fargo, N.D. _ but agency spokesman Fred Farrarsaid others may be added.   The airlines have argued that any aircraft that flies in thevicinity of commercial air traffic should be equipped with thealtitude encoding transponder so a controller more easily candetermine if two planes are on a collision course.   The private pilots, led buy AOPA, maintained that the sweepingrestrictions proposed by the FAA in February amounted to anunnecessary infringment on many pilots. The small plane pilots alsocomplained about the estimated $600 to $2,000 cost for thealtitude-encoding equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
