Ms. Steiger, who assumed leadership of the regulatory agencylast spring, said the informal session was intended to sound outissues of key interest to consumer organizations in the 1990s. Alsotaking part in the meeting was Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio Jr.   Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the PublicInterest said his group wanted the FTC to work together moreclosely with state attorneys general and treat the state officialsas ``full partners'' in developing consumer protection measures.   ``There's enough work for everybody'' at both the federal andstate levels, Silverglade said.   He added that despite various deregulation moves undertakensince the late 1970s, ``the American public has never reallysupported a broad deregulation of consumer protection.''   Another official of the Washington-based center, MichaelJacobson, said the FTC should take a more active role in regulatingadvertising by the alcoholic beverages industry.   He noted that problem drinkers cost American industry about $135billion a year in lost productivity.   Jacobson said the FTC should support legislation to requirehealth warning notices on print liquor ads, equal air time forpublic-service messages about the risks of drinking and eliminationof advertising targeted at young people.   Matthew L. Myers, a representative of the Coalition for Smokingor Health, urged that the FTC take a hard look at advertising bythe tobacco industry for new products such as no-nicotinecigarettes and cigarettes designed to produce less secondary smokebothersome to non-smokers in the same room.   Unless such advertising is very closely regulated, Meyers said,``the American consumer is likely to be misled ... falselybelieving that he or she is avoiding the very real health risks ofsmoking.''   Eileen Kugler, speaking on behalf of another Washington-basedgroup, Public Voice for Food andamp; Health Policy, said the FTC shouldpush for measures to to ensure that food advertising _ particularlyhealth claims made for various products _ is not deceptive ormisleading.   ``The FTC of the last decade has virtually ignored this crucialarea of consumer protection,'' she said.   Ms. Kugler noted that ``even as consumers are being told to bemore careful about what we eat, they have less ability to do so. Asconsumption of highly processed foods has increased, consumers haveless knowledge and understanding about what is actually in thefood.''</TEXT></DOC>
