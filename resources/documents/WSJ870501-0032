Richard J. Ferris, chairman and chief executive officer, told the annual meeting here that Chicago-based Allegis has been exploring options for greater employee participation in the financial performance of the company with the United chapter of the machinists union, which is currently in contract negotiations.    Although Mr. Ferris wouldn't be more specific, John Peterpaul, vice president of transportation for the International Association of Machinists, said that the union has discussed the possibility of partial employee ownership of either the airline or Allegis, formerly UAL Inc. He said negotiations with the company are scheduled to resume next week and that the union &quot;has not yet discussed specific percentages&quot; of ownership.    Some industry officials said Allegis might offer employees stock in an effort to weaken support among workers for the bid by United's pilots to acquire the carrier. Though the possibility of an ownership stake was first proposed by the machinists, the idea apparently has become more attractive to Allegis in the wake of the pilots' buyout proposal.    In recent years, a number of airlines have given stock to employees, but always in return for substantial wage cuts. Allegis would be the first major airline company to create such a program without getting major concessions from labor.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Allegis shares fell $2.875, to $65.50, on volume of 2.7 million shares.    Mr. Ferris suggested that he would be willing to extend any offers to the machinists union to United's flight attendants and pilots unions. Last week, Allegis directors rejected the bid by the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association to purchase the airline for $4.5 billion. The pilots, however, declared their intention to pursue the buyout.    Mr. Ferris said the pilots' offer would wreck the company's long-term growth prospects, and called on the union to discuss &quot;a safer, more sensible plan for financial participation.&quot;    Officials of the United pilots union said the company hadn't yet contacted them about such a plan. F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United Master Executive Council, said anything less than 100% of the airline would be unacceptable to the pilots. &quot;We are not interested in holding discussions about financial participation in Allegis or in reopening the collective bargaining process,&quot; Mr. Dubinsky said.    At the shareholders meeting, Mr. Ferris withstood nearly four hours of questioning from holders, many of whom expressed concern about the corporation's poor financial showing and the value of its stock. Several holders wanted Mr. Ferris's views on whether the company would be worth more broken apart, and complained about the generous special severance pay packages Allegis recently approved for Mr. Ferris and seven other top officials in the event of a hostile takeover.    Mr. Ferris said it may take two to three years before holders realize the full benefit of his efforts to turn Allegis into a full-service travel company, but that holders advocating the immediate breakup of the company would be sacrificing the long-term benefits for short-term gains.    Mr. Ferris also said he believes the corporation may still be a takeover target. Although the board has disposed of the pilots union's offer for the moment, it continues to retain First Boston Corp., New York, and the New York law firm of Davis Polk andamp; Wardell as independent advisers in the event of another takeover threat, according to Allegis's general counsel, Edward Hoenicke.    Several times throughout the meeting, Mr. Ferris said he and Mr. Hartigan were interested in mending relations with the pilots union, which have been strained since a monthlong pilots strike in 1985. But even as he sought to mend fences, he took a swipe at the union. Under questioning from holders, Mr. Ferris blamed the pilots' strike for United's losses in recent years and said the pilots union was responsible for making the company a potential takeover target.    The company's name change to Allegis was approved by holders yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
