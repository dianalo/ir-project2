The accord mainly involves a reorganization of the board,the development of a strategy for a European construction andpublic works project, and the formation of a new unit topursue nonconstruction activities.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement was finally struck late Thursday after aboard meeting that included SAE President Jean-Claude Jammes,leader of a group of shareholders friendly to SAE managementwith 27.1% of its capital, and real estate developer MichelPelege, who owns 33.08%.   Spanish builder Obras y Construcciones S.A., OCISA, whichhas lately acquired a pivotal 15% of SAE's shares wasn'trepresented at the meeting because it had no directors as ofthe last time the board was constituted. As a result, thecompany didn't vote on the proposal but both SAE andspokesmen for Mr. Pelege said OCISA officials had given theirapproval to the plan.   Mr. Jammes will retain the post of president and keep hisseat on the board, which will be expanded, under the pact.Mr. Pelege will have four board seats, up from three; OCISAwill get three seats for the first time, and a group ofinstitutional shareholders, most of whom were listed as partof the management-shareholders pact, will obtain one seateach for the first time. They include Banque Paribas, CreditLyonnais, Comptoir des Entrepreneurs and Societe Generale.   The plan will be presented for final shareholder approvalat a general assembly, expected to be held soon, a companyspokesman said.   OCISA officials in Madrid weren't immediately availablefor comment on the latest proposal.   Late last year, Mr. Pelege announced that he had raisedhis stake in the company to almost a third of the company'sstock as part of a plan to take control. At the time, Mr.Pelege said he hoped to revitalize the company.   Meanwhile, as the group friendly to management united todefend the company against a takeover by Mr. Pelege, OCISAboosted its stake to just over 15%.   With both sides assiduously courting OCISA, companyexecutives at OCISA warned that the major shareholders neededto find a way to co-exist by Jan. 15, and meetings betweenthe sides resumed after a recess in early January.   On Friday, SAE's stock fell on the news as speculators,who had been expecting one player or the other to offer tobuy shares in a takeover bid, sold the stock.   In the first half of 1990, SAE's consolidated net profitafter payments to minority interests fell to 56 millionfrancs ($10.7 million) from 81 million francs in theyear-earlier half, largely reflecting one-time restructuringcosts. Revenue rose to 13.05 billion francs from 12.73billion.</TEXT></DOC>
