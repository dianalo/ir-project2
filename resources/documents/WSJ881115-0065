SEC Chairman David Ruder presented the unanimous position of the five-member commission at a meeting yesterday of securities regulators in Melbourne, Australia. Mr. Ruder said that an effective regulatory framework for a global market should include efficient systems for disseminating market data on prices and trading volume and for executing trades. He added that ultimately all countries should set up automated systems for clearing and settling equity and debt transactions, and that many such systems should be linked.    Mr. Ruder said the SEC also advocates a sound public disclosure system, including comparable accounting standards and compatible stock-registration rules, and favors a &quot;high level&quot; of enforcement cooperation to ensure fair and honest markets.    But in seeking solutions to common problems, he said, regulators &quot;should be sensitive to cultural differences and national sovereignty concerns.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
