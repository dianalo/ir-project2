JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Requirements that industry report toxicchemical releases will force polluters to reduce emissions, but thefirst two years of data show little decline in pollution, theEnvironmental Protection Agency said Wednesday.   The EPA, in an analysis of the toxic inventory reports for 1987and 1988, said that while factories reported a 10 percentstatistical drop in toxic chemical releases the largest part of thedecline was from changes in reporting.   For example, some materials that are normally recycled werereported as releases in 1987 but not in 1988. For the facilitiesreporting the largest decline in pollution between the two years,at least two-thirds of the reduction was ``due to paper changes.''   The EPA said spot checks showed the industry reports weregenerally accurate, but that thousands of facilities may still notbe reporting releases as required by law.   The EPA estimated that in 1987 as many as one-third of thecompanies, or about 10,000, that were required to make reportsfailed to do so. The chemical industry had the highest reportingrecord with 88 percent compliance, while the apparel, printing andpublishing industries had the lowest compliance record, the agencysaid.   Although the agency does not have compliance data for 1988, EPAand industry officials suggested compliance was likely to begreater because 1987 was the first year the reporting law went intoeffect and some companies may not have been aware of it.   The findings were among an array of conclusions reached by EPAofficials in an analysis of two toxic chemical release statisticspreviously made public.   Industry, according to the reports submitted to the EPA andannounced in April, released nearly 4.6 billion pounds of toxicchemicals into the air, water and on land in 1988.   In 1987, the first year the figures were compiled, the total wasnearly 5 billion pounds.   Among the other EPA conclusions, some of which had been reportedpreviously, were:   -Texas and Louisiana accounted for nearly a fourth of all toxicreleases and transfers of toxic materials to disposal sites and 50facilities accounted for 36 percent of these chemicals.   -Cancer-causing chemicals account for about 8 percent of thetotal. The most frequently released carcinogen - 115 million poundsin 1988 - was dichloromethane, used as an industrial solvent andpaint stripper.   -Among the 25 chemicals most widely emitted, seven areconsidered to be ``highly toxic.'' They are ammonia, carbondisulfide, chlorine, zinc, copper, manganese and zinc compounds.   -Five percent more facilities submitted toxic release data in1988 and in 1987, mainly because more plants came under thejurisdiction of the reporting law in 1988. A total of 19,763indstrial plants submitted reports. The requirement covers plantsemitting at least 50,000 pounds of chemicals.   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said he expects that theannual publication of toxic release data will push polluters toreduce toxic chemical releases. The 1989 reports have not beentabulated.   ``These data, which are available to any citizen, should beconsidered to be among the most important weapons in efforts tocombat pollution,'' Reilly said.   A number of chemical companies, including some of the nation'slargest, have said they are pushing for dramatic reductions intoxic releases in the coming years. Clean air legislation nearingcompletion in Congress also requires such reductions.</TEXT></DOC>
