But the step doesn't represent a decision by the Bushadministration to inject itself into the internal fightbetween the Iraqi government and Kurdish and Shiite rebels,senior administration aides said. Rather, the White Housesaid it issued the warning mostly to safeguard internationalrelief flights.</LP><TEXT>   Officials said the U.S. is prepared to shoot down Iraqiaircraft that ignore the warning. But privately, they saidIraq appears effectively to have won the civil war thatfollowed the American-led military campaign to drive Iraqitroops from Kuwait. As a result, the Iraqi government isn'tlikely to want to defy the U.S. warning and use its planes orhelicopters to continue attacking rebels.   Meanwhile, the White House confirmed it intends to sendCongress a supplemental aid bill to provide more humanitarianassistance to Kurdish and Shiite refugees who have fled theirhomes out of fear of reprisals from the Iraqi government.White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the legislationwill call for &quot;millions and millions&quot; of dollars in new aid;as previously reported, administration aides are talkingprivately of an aid request between $150 million and $200million.   The decision to tell Iraq to keep its military forces awayfrom relief operations, particularly in Kurdish areas innorthern Iraq, wasn't designed to help Kurdish rebelsmilitarily but rather to protect &quot;women and children refugeesfleeing the struggle,&quot; a senior administration aide said.Rebels reaching the Iraqi-Turkish border in recent days havecomplained that they continue to come under attack by Iraqihelicopters and planes even as they flee for safety.   One administration official acknowledged that the U.S.issued the warning in part to counteract criticism it hasreceived for failing to move militarily to aid Iraq's Kurdsand Shiites a few weeks ago, when they were in the midst ofthe heaviest fighting with Iraqi government soldiers. Theadministration at that time had made a decision that militaryaid would embroil the U.S. unnecessarily in a messy andunpredictable fight.   &quot;The United States has been doing a lot, and we do wantthe American people to know that we are responding,&quot; Mr.Fitzwater said. &quot;It is in the American tradition to respondto humanitarian needs of this kind.&quot;   Iraq was told last weekend that it shouldn't engage in any&quot;air activity&quot; north of the 36th parallel, which cuts acrossnorthern Iraq, an administration official said. That wouldprohibit Iraq from using any military planes over somesignificant population centers in the Kurdish area of itscountry, including the cities of Irbil and Mosul. Iraqihelicopter activity in the area virtually stopped after Iraqreceived the warning, U.S. officials said.   The warning also appears to apply to Iraqi militaryactivity in southern areas where some 40,000 Shiite refugeesare being helped by American occupying troops, though therehasn't been as much Iraqi military activity in that regionrecently.   The administration isn't saying how long it intends tosquelch Iraqi military activity. Officials said only that thewarning remains in effect as long as U.S. and allied reliefefforts, which center on airdrops of relief supplies,continue.   Nor is it clear precisely how the U.S. will enforce itswarning if Iraq defies it by moving troops or flyinghelicopter gunships, which can be difficult to track andshoot down from afar. The American troops still in southernIraq are hundreds of miles away from the Kurdish refugees inthe north, and even those troops are preparing to clear outas a United Nations observer force moves in to patrol theIraq-Kuwait border.   Though officials say the warning to Iraq wasn't designedto involve the U.S. militarily on the side of Kurdish rebels,the step could have the effect of giving rebel forces a havenwhere they can regroup and prepare to resume their battleswith Saddam Hussein's government. That effectively may createthe kind of &quot;enclave&quot; under international protection thatsome American allies, such as Britain, have been proposing atthe U.N.   The administration is cool toward the idea of anofficially designated Kurdish or Shiite enclave; it worriesthat such a step would lead to a destabilization ordismemberment of Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
