It was found that little lattice damageand no cis-syn cyclobutane dimers are produced in situ by irradiationof dry uracil with /sup 60/Co photons. However, following dissolutionof the irradiated powder in water, radiation products are detected, andseveral of their characteristics have been elucidated. In contrast, followingirradiation by /sup 60/Co photons of uracil in an aqueous environment,massive damage was found in the dried sample. Irradiation of dry uracilwith UV photons is found to cause general lattice damage, but again negligibleconcentrations of cis-syn dimers are produced in situ. There is evidencefor the formation of a planar, dimer-like molecular configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
