Bothrippled and nonrippled designs are included in the technical and costestimation discussions. Open pool cooling in superfluid helium providesextended time cryogenic stability; axial structure also functions asa protective heat absorbing secondary during emergency discharge; structuralproperties of the rippled and nonrippled designs are emphasized; andproblem areas are listed. The cost of the conductor, trench, dewar, struts,radial structure, plus others are proportional to E/sup 2/3/ where E= stored energy; the cost of the axial structure is proportional to E;and the cost of refrigeration is a constant plus an E/sup 2/3/ term.Costs scale approximately from E/sup 0 . 58/ (low E) to E/sup 0 . 71/(100 - 3000 MWh) to E/sup 0 . 78/ (3000 to 10,000 MWh) The cost of theac-dc conversion system is $50/kW, with the power rating an arbitrarychoice. The electrical usage is best for load-leveling units that charge8 h at night and discharge 15 h during the daytime. 98% storage efficiencyand rapid power reversal are the two primary benefits of SMES. The potentialimpact of high T/sub c/ oxide superconductors is a 10%-20% cost reductionfor large SMES units (above 3000 MWh). The operational storage efficiencyof smaller units would improve to better than 95% for E andgt; 10 MWh.</TEXT></DOC>
