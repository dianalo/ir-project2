The Swiss government said the hijacking and the letter, which wasauthenticated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, is anattempt to force the release of a Shiite Moslem hijacker held inSwitzerland.   The government urged all Swiss people to leave Lebanon.   In Beirut, the spiritual guide of pro-Iranian Shiite militantscharged that Washington has hindered the release of the nineAmerican hostages.   ``I have information that the Americans are the ones whocomplicated the issue of the hostages,'' Sheik Mohammed HusseinFadlallah said in an interview today in the weekly magazineAsh-Shiraa.   ``America is after resuming ties with Iran. But it wants tiesresumed without making any political concession.   ``Iran rejects a resumption of ties unless America changes itshostile policy toward Iran and works out some details related tobilateral relations, including the frozen Iranian assets,'' saidFadlallah.   He was referring to assets frozen in the United States aftermilitants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 andheld 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.   In Bern, Foreign Ministry official Edouard Brunner said PeterWinkler's letter said his abduction was intended to pressure theSwiss government.   ``I was not kidnapped as a Red Cross delegate but as a Swisscitizen. My government knows what my kidnappers want from it and ithas to cooperate in order to save my life,'' said the letter.   Swiss authorities say they have not received demands from thekidnappers and nobody has claimed responsibility for Winkler'sabduction.   But, ``it looks very much like blackmail,'' Brunner told a newsconference.   The plane hijacker arrested in Geneva is Hussein Hariri, 22, aLebanese Shiite Moslem who commandeered an Air Afrique jetliner toGeneva in July 1987. He killed a French passenger before beingoverpowered and arrested.   Hariri is to go on trial on various charges Feb. 20 inSwitzerland's supreme court. He could face life imprisonment.   The letter was received earlier today by a Western news agency inBeirut. It is the first news of Winkler, 32, since he was abductedat gunpoint Nov. 17 in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon.   Further abductions cannot be excluded, Brunner said. Thegovernment urged the 150 to 200 Swiss citizens living in Lebanon toleave and told all Swiss to avoid traveling there for non-essentialreasons such as tourism, he said.   The all-Swiss Committee of the Red Cross suspended its operationsin Sidon after Winkler's abduction and withdrew five other delegatesbased in the city.   Brunner said Switzerland will ask Syria, Lebanon, Iran and thePalestine Liberation Organization to help secure Winkler's freedom.   ``We appeal for the help of all governments who might be able touse their moral and political influence,'' he said.   Winkler's committee said in a statement that his abduction is``an unacceptable attack against its humanitarian mission'' andappealed for ``absolute respect'' of its personnel.</TEXT></DOC>
