They'll just dry up,''Humberto Ortega told reporters in Mexico City.   He said only 500 rebels, known as Contras, turned themselves inunder a repatriation program called for in last month's peace accordsigned in Tela, Honduras, by five Central American presidents.   But he said the Contra force was crumbling through quietdesertion.   ``A lot of them don't trust us enough to turn themselves in.They're just putting their guns away and waiting to see whathappens,'' said Ortega, who represented Nicaragua in Mexico'sIndependence Day celebrations.   The Central American presidents signed the agreement Aug. 7 thatcalled for dismantling the Contras, most of whom are based inHonduras along the border with Nicaragua. In return, NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega promised democratic elections, now scheduledfor Feb. 25.   Humberto Ortega said the opposition coalition's presidentialcandidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was allied with U.S.interests.   Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, whoseassassination helped spark the Sandinista revolution that overthrewPresident Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. She served on the firstpost-revolutionary junta but resigned after a year and joined theopposition that formed mainly because of the Sandinistas surge tothe left and its links with Cuba and the Soviet Union.   Humberto Ortega said the Sandinista party will choose itscandidate on Sept. 24. He said he thought his brother, PresidentDaniel Ortega, would be the best nominee.   Daniel Ortega's nomination is considered a virtual certainty.   When asked what the army would do if Mrs. Chamorro and theopposition wins, Humberto Ortega said the defense forces would nottry to control the government. But, he said, the Sandinista army``will never be an army that serves a dominant class.''   The Aug. 7 agreement calls for dismantling the Contras by Dec. 8,but Humberto Ortega said their complete demobilization was unlikely.He added if the Honduran base camps are shut the rebellion willeventually die out.   ``We've already reached a state of relative peace,'' he said.``Once we hold elections we'll be able to reach a state of completepeace.''   The defense minister said about 60 people, including civilians,soldiers and rebels, were killed in fighting in Nicaragua last month.   He said there have been about 50 clashes a month between troopsand rebels, down from about 500 monthly before the United States cutoff military aid to the Contras in 1988. Non-lethal U.S. aid isscheduled to continue through February.   Humberto Ortega estimated the number of Contras in Nicaragua at2,000 and the number in Honduran camps at 4,500, about one-quarterthe number Contra leaders claim.   Journalists estimate there were more than 6,000 fighters in themain Contra camp in Honduras last month, down sharply from more than10,000 in February.</TEXT></DOC>
