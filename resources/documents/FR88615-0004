Background </ITAG>FDA published a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 5, 1986 (51 FR 40160), to providefor the safe use of sucrose fatty acid esters prepared with the solventsdimethyl sulfoxide and isobutyl alcohol That action was in response toa petition filed by Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd. (FAP 5A3839).Suiker Unie Research, P.O. Box 1308, 4700 BH Roosendaal, Holland, filedan objection to the regulation and requested a hearing on each issue raisedin that objection. The company's objection made the following points: (1) The final rule provides for the use of dimethyl sulfoxide in the manufactureof sucrose fatty acid esters. (2) Dimethyl sulfoxide is an irritant, is toxic, and has never been approvedfor direct food additive use by FDA. (3) Manufacturing procedures exist that do not require dimethyl sulfoxide,and hence, there is no reason to increase the risk to the public healthby approving this petition. (4) There is no rationale under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348) to approve sucrose fatty acidesters as being safe when manufactured with dimethyl sulfoxide. The objection did not mention isobutyl alcohol, and thus that substanceis not discussed in this document. After FDA received the objection, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd.,the petitioner, through its attorneys, submitted a letter stating thatit ``opposes the objections and request for a hearing raised by SuikerUnie Research,'' and that FDA should deny Suiker Unie Research's requestfor a hearing and confirm the effectiveness of the order amending 21 CFR172.859. The preamble to the November 5, 1986, final rule explained that the agencyhad evaluated the data presented in the petition and had concluded thatthe proposed use of dimethyl sulfoxide is safe. Thus, the final rule continued,the food additive regulations would be amended as requested in the petition.That document did not discuss the specific nature of the data evaluated,however. In this document, the agency is republishing the final rule andis explaining in detail why the petitioned use was approved. The agencybelieves that this course of action is appropriate because FDA consideredthe factors that Suiker Unie Research relies upon in its objections inthe agency's deliberations on whether to grant Mitsubishi's petition. Theagency rejected each of these factors in concluding that the use of sucrosefatty acid esters manufactured with dimethyl sulfoxide as a solvent issafe. FDA will set forth the reasons it rejected these factors in thisdocument. The objector and any other interested person will then have anopportunity, if it still believes that a hearing is necessary, to profferfacts that demonstrate that the agency's bases for rejecting these factorswere incorrect and thus to justify a hearing on this matter. FDA will describebelow the type of showing that must be made to justify a hearing. The agency is therefore republishing the final rule and providing an additional30 days for the submission of objections or of additional information insupport of the objection that has already been filed. In accordance withits discretion under section 409(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 348(f)), theagency is not staying the final rule. The agency will consider a stay,however, if one is requested, after it has evaluated any objections orother information filed in response to this <T4>Federal Register </T4>document. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Request for a Hearing </ITAG>FDA will act on any requests for a hearing after it has evaluated the informationfiled in response to this document. In order to accommodate persons whowant to request a hearing, the following information is provided. Section 409(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(f)) provides that any person adverselyaffected by a food additive regulation may file objections, specifyingwith particularity the provisions of the order ``deemed objectionable,stating reasonable grounds therefore,'' and request a public hearing basedupon such objections. However, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs may denythe hearing request if the objections to the regulation do not raise genuineand significant issues of fact that can be resolved at a hearing. Specificcriteria for determining whether a request for a hearing is valid are (21CFR 12.24(b)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolutionat a hearing. A hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The factual issues can be resolved by available and specificallyidentified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basisof mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions andcontentions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The data and information submitted, if established at a hearing,would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the waysought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Commissioner concludesthat the data and information submitted are insufficient to justify thefactual determination urged, even if accurate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the personis adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will not be grantedon factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the actionrequested, e.g., if the Commissioner concludes that the action would bethe same even if the factual issues were resolved in the say sought * **.</ITAG>A party seeking a hearing is required to meet a ``threshold burden of tenderingevidence suggesting the need for a hearing.'' <T3>Costle </T3>v. <T3>Pacific Legal Foundation, </T3>445 U.S. 198, 214-215 (1980) <T3>reh. den. </T3>445 U.S. 947 (1980), citing <T3>Weinberger </T3>v. <T3>Hynson, Westcott andamp; Dunning, Inc., </T3>412 U.S. 609, 620-621 (1973).An allegation that a hearing is necessary to ``sharpen the issues'' orto ``fully develop the facts'' does not meet this test. <T3>Georgia Pacific Corp. </T3>v. <T3>U.S. E.P.A., </T3>671 F.2d 1235, 1241 (9th Cir. 1982). If a hearingrequest fails to identify any evidence that would be the subject of a hearing,there is no point in holding one.A hearing request must not only contain evidence, but that evidence shouldraise a material issue of fact concerning which a meaningful hearing mightbe held. <T3>Pineapple Growers Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>673 F.2d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir. 1982). Where the issues raisedin the objection are, even if true, legally insufficient to alter the decision,the agency need not grant a hearing. <T3>Dyestuffs and Chemicals, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Flemming, </T3>271 F.2d 281 (8th Cir. 1959) <T3>cert. denied, </T3>362 U.S. 911 (1960). FDA need not grant a hearingin each case where an objection submits additional information or positsa novel interpretation of existing information. See <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Consolidated Mines andamp; Smelting Co., </T3>445 F.2d 432 (9th Cir.1971). Stated another way, a hearing is justified only if the objectionsare made in good faith, and if they ``draw in question in a material waythe underpinnings of the regulation at issue.'' <T3>Pactra Industries </T3>v. <T3>CPSC, </T3>555 F.2d 677 (9th Cir. 1977). Finally, courts have uniformlyrecognized that a hearing need not be held to resolve questions of lawor policy. See <T3>Citizens for Allegan County, Inc., </T3>v. <T3>FPC, </T3>414 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1969); <T3>Sun Oil Co. </T3>v. <T3>FPC, </T3>256 F.2d 233, 240 (5th Cir.) <T3>cert. denied, </T3>358 U.S. 872 (1958).In conclusion, a request for a hearing, in order to be granted, must presentsufficient credible evidence to raise a material issue of fact, and thisevidence must be capable of resolving the issue in favor of the request.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Evaluation of Safety</ITAG>Mitsubishi Chemical Industries proposed that dimethyl sulfoxide be usedin the manufacture of sucrose fatty acid esters, and that any listing regulationprovide that the residue of dimethyl sulfoxide in the final product notexceed 2 parts per million (ppm).To support the limitation of 2 parts per million (ppm) for dimethyl sulfoxide,the petitioner analyzed, by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), samples ofsucrose fatty acid esters that were spiked at 2 ppm dimethyl sulfoxideand compared them to unspiked samples. The recovery rates of the spikedsamples were between 90 and 110 percent. Those analyses were validatedby GLC of samples spiked at 1, 2, and 4 ppm dimethyl sulfoxide with reportedrecovery rates between 100 and 120 percent.In evaluating the petition, FDA examined the analytical methodology thepetitioner used to determine the dimethyl sulfoxide residue levels andrecovery rates. Based on its examination of the data submitted, FDA foundthat the methodology is satisfactory for assuring that dimethyl sulfoxidecan be reliably detected at 2 ppm in sucrose fatty acid esters.The agency's conclusion that the use of dimethyl sulfoxide under the petitionedcondition of use is safe is based on comparisons of estimates of humanexposure to dimethyl sulfoxide from sucrose fatty acid esters manufacturedwith dimethyl sulfoxide to human exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide from naturalfood sources and to the acceptable daily intake level for dimethyl sulfoxidecalculated from animal studies reported in the literature.A. Estimated Daily IntakeThe agency has calculated an estimated daily intake for dimethyl sulfoxideas part of its assessment of the safety of the use of this chemical inthe manufacture of sucrose fatty acid esters. Assuming a maximum concentrationof 2 ppm dimethyl sulfoxide in sucrose fatty acid esters, and that allsucrose fatty acid esters on the market are produced by the petitionedprocess (an unlikely event), the agency calculated that the estimated dailyintake of dimethyl sulfoxide from this use would be 1.1 micrograms perperson per day.B. Exposure to Dimethyl Sulfoxide From Natural Food SourcesThe petitioner provided evidence that dimethyl sulfoxide is a natural componentof fruits, vegetables, grains, and beverages (Ref. 8) and generally occursat levels not greater than 3 ppm, with levels in black tea being an exceptionat 16 ppm. Using data from the U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of Census,1976 survey) for coffee consumption as an example of a source of dimethylsulfoxide (at 3 cups of coffee per person per day), the petitioner calculateda daily intake of naturally occurring dimethyl sulfoxide (2.6 ppm in coffeebeans) of 93.6 micrograms per person per day, assuming 12 grams of beansare used to prepare 1 cup of coffee. FDA concurs with this estimate. Basedon this estimate, it is clear that the intake of dimethyl sulfoxide fromcoffee alone far exceeds the 1.1 micrograms per person per day estimateddaily intake anticipated from potential dimethyl sulfoxide residues insucrose fatty acid esters intentionally added to the diet.C. Acceptable Daily IntakeFDA calculated the acceptable daily intake of dimethyl sulfoxide to be9 milligrams per kilogram of body weight or 630 milligrams for a 70-kilogramadult. This calculation was based on a study that involved chronic oraladministration of dimethyl sulfoxide (Ref. 7). In that study, an aqueoussolution (90 percent volume by volume) of pharmaceutical-grade dimethylsulfoxide was administered to four groups of rhesus monkeys via gastricintubation, 7 days per week, during a 2-year period. One half of the dosewas given in the morning, the other half in the afternoon. Two animalsper sex were in the groups treated with 1 and 3 milliliters per kilogramof body weight and 3 animals per sex at 9 milliliters per kilogram. Electrocardiograms,hematologic studies, and chemical analyses of the urine were done. Eyeexaminations were conducted, and gross, as well as histopathologic, examinationswere made terminally. Vogin reported toxicological or pathological changesfrom oral administration of dimethyl sulfoxide to monkeys at a dose of1 milliliter per kilogram. Therefore, from this study the no-effect levelof dimethyl sulfoxide is approximately 900 milligrams per kilogram. Thususing a 100-fold safety factor, the acceptable daily intake is 9 milligramsper kilogram or 630 milligrams for a 70-kilogram adult.D. Conclusion on SafetyFrom the available evidence, the agency found that the estimated dailyintake (1.1 micrograms per person per day) of dimethyl sulfoxide from sucrosefatty acid esters manufactured with this chemical would be negligible whencompared to the exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide from natural food sources(e.g., coffee at 93.6 micrograms per person per day) and when comparedto the acceptable daily intake of dimethyl sulfoxide of 630 milligramsper person per day, as calculated from published toxicological data. Consequently,the agency concluded that the use of dimethyl sulfoxide under the petitionedconditions of use is safe.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Issues</ITAG>Suiker Unie Research raised four issues in its objections to the finalrule.The first issue is the significance that is to be given to the fact thatdimethyl sulfoxide is an irritant and is toxic. As discussed above, theagency is aware that dimethyl sulfoxide is a toxic irritant. However, FDA'sassessment of the safety of the requested use took into consideration theexpected levels of human exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide resulting fromthe petitioned use as well as the known toxicity of dimethyl sulfoxide.The agency's conclusion is that the level of residue of dimethyl sulfoxidethat could get into food as a result of this use is safe.The second issue is the significance of the fact that dimethyl sulfoxidehas never been approved for direct food additive use by FDA. This issueis not relevant. FDA decides whether a food additive is safe based on theconditions of use proposed in a petition. Based upon its evaluation ofMitsubishi's petition, the agency concluded that, except for residues ofdimethyl sulfoxide (and isobutyl alcohol), the sucrose fatty acid estersthat are the subject of the petition meet the specifications in 21 CFR172.859 and therefore would be safe for human consumption. As mentionedabove under section III.D._Conclusion on Safety, FDA found that the dimethylsulfoxide residues in this product are safe based on the finding that theresidual level of dimethyl sulfoxide in the sucrose fatty acid esters isbelow the amount found naturally in certain foods as well as below theamount found to be an acceptable daily intake. Therefore, FDA concludesthat the subject food additive is safe even though it contains a constituentthat has never been approved for use as a direct food additive.The third issue is whether because there are other manufacturing proceduresfor sucrose fatty acid esters that do not require dimethyl sulfoxide, thereis any reason to increase the risk to human health by approving this petition.The act does not give FDA the authority to limit the number of manufacturingprocesses that can be used to produce a food additive. FDA's charge underthe act is to decide whether a petitioned use of a food additive is safe,and whether the additive will have the technical effect claimed for it.If so, FDA must grant the petition. FDA found that both of these requirementsare met with respect to the petitioned use of sucrose fatty acid estersmade with dimethyl sulfoxide and isobutyl alcohol, and thus under the act,FDA is granting Mitsubishi's petition and listing this food additive.The fourth issue is whether there is a rationale under section 409 of theact to approve sucrose fatty acid esters as being safe when manufacturedwith dimethyl sulfoxide. FDA has found that there is. This document setsforth the reasons why use of the subject product is safe.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>In this document FDA has clarified the basis for its decision that sucrosefatty acid esters made using fatty acids made with dimethyl sulfoxide andisobutyl alcohol are safe for use in food under the conditions of use setforth in andSection; 172.859. FDA has decided that the objection does notprovide sufficient evidence to warrant the stay of the amendment requestedby Suiker Unie Research. However, FDA is republishing the final rule andproviding a new 30-day objection period to allow for submission of furtherevidence that would support the need for a stay of the regulation or foran evidentiary hearing on FDA's decision to list this food additive.In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition,the administrative record, and all documents that FDA considered and reliedupon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available forinspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (addressabove) by appointment with the information contact person listed above.As provided in andSection; 171.1(h)(2), the agency will delete from the documentsany materials that are not available for public disclosure before makingthe documents available for inspection.
