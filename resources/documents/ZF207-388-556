Dodaro,director of operations in GAO's Accounting and Financial Management Division,told the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Government Informationand Regulation, &quot;Cost estimates for the 1990 census are following the 1980pattern, when they rose dramatically as the census year drew closer.&quot;andM;GAO reported that in 1975 the Commerce Department estimated the 1980 censuswould cost $450 million.andP;  That estimate rose to $565 million in 1977, and in1980 climbed to $1 billion.andP;  The 1980 census actually cost $1.1 billion.andP;  Thereport said that because the bureau had underestimated costs for 1980, it ranout of funds during the census, disrupting operations and requiring $50million in supplemental appropriations.andM;GAO said the funding shortfall in 1980 diminished data quality and sloweddissemination of some publications.andM;In 1985 Commerce officials said the 1990 census would cost $1.8 billion, butthe estimate increased to $2.6 billion by 1986.andM;Dodaro said he does not believe the bureau will maintain the required highlevel of accuracy and timeliness of data without exceeding cost estimates.andO;The bureau also will have difficulty attracting and retaining the more than400,000 temporary employees needed to conduct the census, he said.andM;Meanwhile, the Bureau has moved to contain costs by making programreductions.andM;Cutting BackandM;Bureau officials said they could save more than $40 million by scaling backpay increments and eliminating proposed geographic pay scales for processingoffice personnel, decreasing data editing of population characteristics inthe nation's most rural areas and reducing staff and travel funds for censuspromotion activities.andM;As the Census Bureau moves to contain costs, it simultaneously facesadditional financial pressures, such as the need to raise its 1990 pay ratesfor district offices to competitive levels, officials said.andP;  The bureau isconsidering adopting geographic wage rates for its more than 450 districtoffices, based on competitive pay in those regions.andM;GAO recommended the bureau make a complete cost estimate and determineprogram priorities.andP;  It said the census needs such a list of programpriorities to confront difficult funding decisions.andP;  The failure to make suchdecisions now could force later cutbacks in census operations -- cutbacksthat could be more drastic than those that occurred in 1980.andM;GAO warned that as in 1980, the bureau then might be compelled to requestsupplemental funding.andM;GAO said the bureau also needs to continue early efforts to plan for the 2000census.andP;  &quot;It needs to execute its research and experimental program in the1990 census to help prepare for the future.andP;  Early planning is critical ifthe bureau intends to make significant changes in census methodology ortechnology for the 2000 census,&quot; Dodaro said.andM;GAO also reported the bureau has improved its operations by allowing moretime for census data to be processed, Dodaro said.andP;  The bureau has automatedsome error-prone manual operations, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
