(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A television reporter who was elected OhioCounty surveyor by write-in votes says he has no intention ofcarrying out the duties of his office. In fact, he isn't even surewhat they are.   ``It was a lark,'' said Donald Wayne Ullom, a reporter forWTOV-TV of nearby Steubenville, Ohio. ``I'm flattered.''   Ullom won the Nov. 8 election with 28 write-in votes. Write-invotes also were cast for 27 other people.   No one filed to run for the office. But several people warnedUllom they would write his name on the ballot.   ``They could have written in anybody's name,'' Ullom said. ``Bysome quirk of the imagination, more people wrote in my name.''   Ullom, who uses the name Donald Wayne on the air, said he has nosurveying experience. But that's OK because the job has no dutiesand no salary.   ``In some counties they use the office,'' said Ohio CountyAdministrator Tom Samol. ``Here, God, I can't even remember the lasttime we used it.   ``I believe some counties use the office, but what for, Icouldn't really tell you.''   Donald Bartholomew served as Ohio County surveyor from 1978 to1984.   ``Nobody's used it. No one's ever done anything with it,''Bartholomew said. ``There's no salary unless you negotiate with theOhio County Commission. There's no qualifications.''   The state code requires the county surveyor to be called upon``if there is to be a change in county line. The county commissionshould order a survey of the entire county to be included in the newcounty.''   ``It's sort of an archaic position,'' said Gene Adkins, executivedirector of the West Virginia Association of Counties. ``There's nosalary. They're not provided with anything. In a few counties, thecounty commission gives them a little office.''   Ullom said he has no intention of even taking the oath of officebefore a judge or notary public.   ``I didn't run for the office,'' Ullom said.</TEXT></DOC>
