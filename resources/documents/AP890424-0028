Cheney, in a television interview on Sunday, also said PresidentBush has decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile strategicmissiles, combining the MX and the Midgetman missiles in thenation's defense.   The defense secretary is scheduled to appear before Congress onTuesday to detail the cuts.   Bush decided to cut spending on Star Wars, formally known as theStrategic Defense Initiative or SDI, to $4.6 billion for fiscalyear 1990, down from the $5.9 billion proposed by President Reagan.Over the next five years, Bush would spend $33 billion on SDI,compared to Reagan's proposed $40 billion.   Cheney said the president will shift the focus of SDI fromdeployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more advancedsystem, known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of thousands oforbiting satellites.   ``SDI is alive and well, but like everything else, it has to fitinto a reduced budget,'' Cheney said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''program.   Bush turned down Cheney's recommendation to move the nation's 50MX missiles, with 10-warheads apiece, from silos to deployment onrailroad cars rather than develop a single-warhead missile to bebased on trucks.   The single-warhead missile is backed by national securityadviser Brent Scowcroft and the chairmen of the Senate and HouseArmed Services Committees, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. LesAspin, D-Wis.   ``What I recommended to the president was that we go forwardwith the rail-garrison system. Brent Scowcroft recommended we goforward with the small ICBM. The president basically said, `Try todo both,''' Cheney said.   ``But instead of doing both simultaneously, we will try tosequence them. That is, we will do rail garrison first, try to puta little bit of money in the budget next year for the small ICBM,and then as we get the rail garrison deployed, we will start toramp up on the small ICBM,'' he said.   The small ICBM, known as the Midgetman, ultimately would cost$24 billion for 500 warheads, versus $5.4 billion for the samenumber of warheads aboard the rail-mobile MX, according to recentcongressional estimates.   The defense secretary said he had decided to delay work for oneyear on another strategic weapon, the stealth bomber, designed toelude enemy targeting radar. Original plans called for 132 ofstealth bombers, and recent reports have estimated the cost at $500million apiece, making it the costliest U.S. warplane ever.   ``We're going to postpone actually going into full procurementon it because I'm not comfortable with the program yet. There are alot of technical problems with it and it is extremely expensive,''he said.   Turning to the Navy, Cheney said the administration plans tokeep all four World War II vintage battleships in the fleet despitean explosion last week aboard one of them, the USS Iowa, thatkilled 47 sailors.   He said investigators have not yet determined what caused one ofthe 16-inch guns on the middle turret of the Iowa to explode lastWednesday, but the event did not shake his support for keepingbattleships in the fleet.   ``It may be a matter of several months before we have all thedetails,'' said Cheney. ``But we will do our best to get to thebottom of it and find out exactly what did happen.''   The defense secretary said the battleships, brought out ofretirement by Reagan during his military buildup, would be used assurrogates for aircraft carriers, which he has decided to cut fromthe 15 envisioned by Reagan to 14 by retiring older ones as newmodels enter service.</TEXT></DOC>
