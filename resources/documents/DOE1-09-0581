The motivationfor these improvements has not been just safeguards: the desire for betterprocess control also has played a major role, and the emergence of technologyfocused on the problems of MCandA has made it possible to pursue suchimprovements. However, it is a continuing challenge to match the needsof the operational MCandA elements with the capabilities and resourcesof the RandD community. In the last couple of years this challenge hasbeen addressed very visibly by the DOE's Project Cerberus RandD Committee,which has devised a procedure to encourage closer interactions betweenthe operations and RandD elements. In the particular case of Los Alamos,we have recently concluded the efforts of the Nuclear Materials Managementand Safeguards Task Force, which made strong recommendations about theneed for close internal cooperation. The issues associated with theseactivities and the specific means for addressing them, will be of surpassinginterest for the future of safeguards.</TEXT></DOC>
