Even under highly favourable assumptions for nuclear powerin scenarios of moderate to high energy growth, nuclear power cannotcontribute significantly to abating greenhouse warming, except possiblyin scenarios of low energy growth for which the problem is already largelyameliorated by efficiency improvement. In the USA -the world's largestproducer of CO/sub 2/ - each dollar invested in electric efficiency displacesnearly seven times as much CO/sub 2/ as a dollar invested in nuclearpower. Even if the most optimistic aspirations for the future economicsof nuclear power were realized today, efficiency would still displacebetween 2.5 and 10 times more CO/sub 2/ per unit investment. We concludethat revitalizing nuclear power would be a relatively expensive and ineffectiveresponse to greenhouse warming, and that the key to reducing future CO/sub2/ emissions is to improve the energy efficiency of the global economy.</TEXT></DOC>
