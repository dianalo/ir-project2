The ESR spectra analysis has allowedthe singling out of two types of radical: (1) the perfluoroalkyl radicalin which the unpaired electron stabilization is thought to be connectedwith the steric isolation of the surrounding perfluoromethyl groups and(2) the perfluoroalkyl radical whose stabilization is connected withthe delocalization of the unpaired electron conjugated with the doubleC=C bond. These stable radicals may be employed in the synthesis andmodification of fluoropolymers as initiators and regulators, in the dosimetryof reactor irradiation, as well as in medico-biological investigationsas spin-labelled compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
