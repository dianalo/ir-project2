(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The seizure of a Roman Catholic churchby dissident Polish parishioners reflects a growing cultural clashbetween the U.S. church and a new wave of Polish immigrants, aCatholic official says.   About 100 parishioners began occupying St. Michael the ArchangelChurch on Saturday because they want the Rev. Roman Palaszewski toremain. The priest, part of an exchange program begun with Polishchurch authorities, has been ordered to return to Poland.   The protesting parishioners claim their new pastor, the Rev. JohnBambol, engineered Palaszewski's ouster because the latter was tooactive in the Polish community.   They said Palaszewski, who has been in seclusion since hisremoval, brought enthusiasm to the church, knitted together the oldand young parishioners, packed the Polish-language Masses andstarted a Polish-language class for their children.   The drama in Bridgeport has played out at other Polish parishesin recent years.   In August 1987, 1,000 parishioners at a church in New Britaintook to the streets to protest the transfer of one of their priests.A month later, Polish immigrants in Portland, Maine, picketedoutside their church demanding a Mass in their native language.   One top church official attributed these and many less stridentflare-ups across the country to attitudes brought to the UnitedStates by Poles weaned on a more politicized church and theSolidarity movement.   ``It's two different world views,'' said the Rev. Peter W.Zendzian, who directs the office for pastoral care of immigrants andrefugees for the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops in Washington.   ``You have a lot of people who were Solidarity members and theywere able ... to mobilize quickly and make their feelings known,''he said Thursday. ``We're more used to getting a committee andstudying things. Our processes usually take a little bit longer.''   The parishioners in Bridgeport are vowing to occupy the ornate,89-year-old brick church in a largely Hispanic neighborhood untilBishop Edward Egan, who heads the Bridgeport diocese, agrees to meetwith them.   They have maintained their vigil in shifts, their numbersswelling each evening to as many as 200.   Most sit quietly in the candle-lit sanctuary, singing hymns andchanting prayers in Polish.   Some drift to the back of the church, kneeling before an icon ofthe Black Madonna of Czestochowa, who is revered by PolishCatholics. Nearby is another icon of the Rev. Maximilian Kolbe, thePolish priest martyred in a Nazi concentration camp.   Frustrated by the bishop's refusal to meet with them, two of thedissidents began a hunger strike Wednesday night. They vowed toremain locked in a confessional until their demands were met.   A three-hour meeting Thursday night between members of the groupand diocesan officials failed to settle the dispute.   Palaszewski's five-year contract was terminated in December byjoint agreement between Franciscan officials in the United Statesand Krakow, Poland, according to church officials.   The priest was removed in December without explanation. Diocesanleaders, who have said Palaszewski has the right to appeal histransfer, didn't comment on the dispute after Thursday's meeting.   The dissidents, many wearing Solidarity buttons and ribbons withthe red-and-white colors of the Polish flag, have made no attempt todisrupt the daily Masses that continue to be celebrated in bothEnglish and Polish.   The group includes a number of former Solidarity members who cameto this country within the last five years, including RichardDebski, one of the hunger strikers.   ``This situation is not only for our church, it is everywherethere are Polish people,'' said Debski, who was jailed for aboutfive months as a leader of Solidarity in the Polish city of Wroclaw.   Ironically, the event that precipitated the rebellion reflectsefforts by the American Roman Catholic church to accommodate theneeds of Polish immigrants, who say they feel closer to Polishpriests than to American priests.   About 70,000 Poles have emigrated to the United States since1977, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Thenumber of immigrants peaked in 1984 and 1985, when about 9,400 cameto America in each year.   Zendzian said the church set up the exchange program about a yearago with church authorities in Poland to bring Polish priests toAmerica.   Palaszewski, the priest at the center of the St. Michael'sdispute, was brought to America under a similar program operated bythe Franciscan order, which is responsible for assigning priests toSt. Michael's.</TEXT></DOC>
