The House voted 406-17 Wednesday to approve the same version oflegislation passed by the Senate on Sept. 24.   It now goes to the White House for President Bush's signature.   The Supreme Court held in a 1989 ruling that employee benefitswere not afforded protection under the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967.   The measure puts Congress on record as taking the position thatthe high court's decision went against lawmakers' intent when theypassed the landmark age discrimination bill 23 years ago.   Several lawmakers had been seeking to reverse the effects of thecourt ruling more than two years ago in a case pitting June Bettsof Cincinnati against the Employees Retirement System of Ohio.   At 61, Ms. Betts, a speech pathologist in Hamilton County, Ohio,was disabled with Alzheimer's disease. She was denied disabilityretirement because she was over 60.

Reaching the $1 billion mark ``shows that DEA has been quiteaggressive in stripping drug traffickers of their ill-gotten gains,the proceeds of their illegal activities,'' Bonner said.   The $1.025 billion seized, according to preliminary figures forfiscal 1990, was far higher than the DEA's budget of $548.7 millionfor that year, Bonner said. It represented a 4.4 percent increaseover the $979.1 million in assets seized by the DEA the previousyear.   But Bonner said in an interview Tuesday that the seizures won'thelp defray the federal budget deficit just yet. The assets mustfirst be forfeited, which can take years.</TEXT></DOC>
