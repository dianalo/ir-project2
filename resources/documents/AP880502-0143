Earlier, in Mishawaka, Ind., Bush called congressional Democratsshort-sighted for cutting President Reagan's military requests andsaid the nation could be hurt if an inexperienced Democrat iselected president.   ``Inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only ournational security, but also our economic health,'' said Bush, whohas previously criticized Democratic Dukakis' lack of foreignpolicy experience.   Bush, who has already won enough delegates to sew up theRepublican presidential nomination, campaigned Monday in Indianaand Ohio one day before the two states have their primaries.   In Vandalia, fielding questions from Butler High Schoolstudents, Bush was asked whether it was true, as Dukakis hascharged, that the United States had paid Panama's strongman ManuelNoriega $200,000 a year.   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,''Bush replied. ``And I'd say, `What would you do about it?' It'sfine sitting out there. You see, you can make a lot of unfoundedcriticism. But what's his suggestion? What's he going to do, and doit in a way that handles the delicate Central Americanrelationships that we're building?''   ``We're moving towards democracy. Ninety percent are now livingunder democracy in this hemisphere. We don't want to set that backby some kind of macho statement out of Harvard,'' Bush said.Dukakis, after being turned out of office in 1978, lectured atHarvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.   Bush said of the Massachusetts governor: ``One of the beautifulthings about being a new candidate without a heck of a lot ofexperience in foreign affairs is you can make dramatic statementswithout necessarily having the proof.''   He said he was ``somewhat inhibited'' from discussing thesituation in Panama because he was once CIA director. But he didsay, ``When it became demonstrably clear that Noriega was involvedin drugs, we moved against him, with an indictment.''   Bush said the United States does not want to hurt the Panamanianpeople or take steps that appear as a ``great bullying,gringoes-of-the-North kind of overstatement of power. ... We'restill living down some of the military intervention of the UnitedStates in Central America.''   In Indiana, he said, ``The country wants to move ahead, not goback to the misery we inherited through the very policies (Jesse)Jackson and Dukakis are talking about.''   Bush appeared at an airport rally in South Bend, then visited anAM-General factory in nearby Mishawaka and took a short ride in aHummer, a fast-moving successor to the military Jeep. He told 500workers he would try to keep their production line open.   AM-General has made 48,000 of the vehicles since 1983 and hascontracts for nearly 20,000 more. However, the Army has shelvedplans to buy more Hummers for 1990 and beyond because of budgetconstraints.   Bush said the United States, despite progress in nuclear armstalks with the Soviets, stll faces ``a substantial imbalance'' inconventional forces around the world. He said the Soviets have``twice as many tanks and artillery pieces as the Western alliance.   ``As we seek to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons, it'scritical that we maintain, strengthen and modernize ourconventional deterrent in Europe,'' he said. ``The Hummer is anintegral part of that.''   ``We took a $31 billion cut in defense because of the oppositionin the Congress, a lot of it affecting what happens on this veryproduction line in the future. ... I think it's shortsighted tofool around with the defense muscle of the United States ofAmerica,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
