Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS SEC </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and other defendants are expected to try this week to block Judge Milton Pollack from presiding over the Securities and Exchange Commission case against Drexel, junk-bond chief Michael Milken and others.    Judge Pollack agreed Sept. 7 to the SEC's request that he preside over the massive case, which the SEC maintained is closely related to 13 civil suits that Judge Pollack is already handling. Because Judge Pollack agreed that the cases are related, he sidestepped the usual case-lottery system of assigning judges.    The SEC complaint charges Drexel, Mr. Milken and others with insider trading and other securities-law violations. The 13 suits pending before Judge Pollack also involve allegations against Drexel, as well as against imprisoned former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky.    But the defense lawyers are expected to argue that the 13 cases -- many of which are shareholder suits -- are fundamentally different from the SEC action because they were brought by individuals and not by the government. Citing one difference, defense lawyers noted that shareholder suits are generally tried before a jury, while SEC cases are tried by a judge without a jury.    Therefore, the lawyers are expected to maintain, the SEC case should be brought before a different judge selected through the lottery.    The outcome could be of great significance because the 81-year-old senior judge is perceived by many defense lawyers as sympathetic to the government. He is known for having issued tough rulings in insider-trading cases, including a 1986 decision involving alleged insider trading before a tender offer announcement by Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Co. for St. Joe Minerals Corp.    Adding to the Drexel defense lawyers' concerns is a proposed order that Judge Pollack issued Friday that would consolidate the SEC case against Drexel with the 13 private lawsuits for purposes of conducting the pre-trial fact-finding process known as discovery. This could mean that lawyers in all the cases would have to question key witnesses such as Mr. Boesky together instead of separately.    Defense lawyers cited this move as an example of why the same judge shouldn't preside over both cases. Depositions and other products of discovery generally are much more influential in cases tried before a judge than in jury cases, they said. Thus, lawyers representing defendants in the SEC case have much more at stake in the discovery process and should have the opportunity to conduct their own interviews, the lawyers said.    Judge Pollack set a hearing for Thursday in federal court in New York to listen to lawyers' arguments on whether he should issue the order consolidating the cases for discovery purposes. It is at this hearing that defense lawyers are expected to ask Judge Pollack not to preside over the SEC case.    Defense lawyers said they were willing to risk angering Judge Pollack by asking him to step aside. Angering the judge &quot;doesn't mean a thing here, because the judge will be upset anyway&quot; if defense lawyers fight his effort to consolidate discovery in the cases, one attorney said. &quot;If we believe that this is in our clients' best interest, we have no choice&quot; but to seek a new judge, the lawyer said.    If Judge Pollack declines the request to remove himself, the lawyers could appeal to a higher court in a writ of mandamus. But while it is clear that defense lawyers are considering such an extraordinary measure, it isn't certain that they would want to take so major a step, because an unfavorable Appeals Court ruling could further anger the judge and adversely affect the outcome of the case.    Complicating the already tangled procedural situation is the possibility that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday will ask that defense lawyers be barred from interviewing Mr. Boesky in the SEC case until the government completes the criminal investigations in which Mr. Boesky is cooperating. Mr. Giuliani earlier blocked the questioning of Mr. Boesky in the shareholder suits.    Recently, Mr. Giuliani issued &quot;target letters&quot; to Mr. Milken and at least four other individuals, formally indicating that federal prosecutors will seek criminal charges against them. If such charges are filed, there is a good chance that the criminal case would proceed before the SEC case.
