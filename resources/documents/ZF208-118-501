Fitzgerald, assistant director of planning and finance at theLivermore, Calif., energy fusion facility, said in an interview a &quot;hugeimpact&quot; from expanding the current network may come sometime after the end ofthe year, when 19 high-speed, open-protocol routers purchased by the EnergyDepartment will be installed at key U.S.andP;  research sites.andM;The new TCP/IP and X.25 dual-protocol routers will allow energy scientists tosend electronic-mail messages and research data to each other acrossT1-speed, fiber-optic leased lines.andM;The Energy Department's Office of Energy Research bought the internetworkrouters from Cisco Systems Inc., Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  For the networkbackbone, the agency wil continue to lease its land links and trans-Atlanticlines from common carriers, Fitzgerald said.andM;The backbone will be called the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) and will linkphysicists at the National Magnetic Fusion Computer Center To scientists withsimilar interests at the Japanese Institute of Plasma Physics in Nagoya,Japan; the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva; and theInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) at the Max PlanckInstitute, Garching, West Germany.andM;ITER is a facility shared by authorized U.S., Soviet, Japanese and Europeanscientists who are developing a fusion device &quot;so large that no one countryreally wants to bear the full burden,&quot; Fitzgerald said.andM;He said the 1.544-megabit/sec ESnet backbone will connect two importantenergy science networks: the Magnetic Fusion Energy Network, whose hub is theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore; and the High-EnergyPhysics Network, whose center is the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory inChicago.andM;The original Magnetic Fusion Energy network, set up in 1975, used56-kilobit/sec leased analog lines.andP;  That was before the introduction ofDigital Data Services (DDS), Fitzgerald said.andM;&quot;We were subject to enormous, problems because we had to go through switchingsites across the country,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Retransmissions were eating up all ourbandwidth.&quot;andM;To avoid those problems, the original network was upgraded, and satellitelinks replaced the land links that had proved unreliable, Fitzgerald said.andO;Since then, the common carriers have refined DDS, and land lines have becomemore reliable, he said.andM;But now, with fiber-optic alternatives, the satellites links are no their wayout, Fitzgerald said.andP;  &quot;Fortunately, fiber optics are reliable andcost-competitive with satellite services,&quot; he said.andM;He said computer center engineers at Livermore had been able to mask theannoying satellite delays with a software module on a host computer.andM;But he said with the alternate-routing and open-architecture design of theESnet backbone, the engineers will be unable to mask a satellite delay orstop it &quot;if your cursor moves across the screen in a herky-jerky way that'sbothersome to you.&quot;andM;Fitzgerald said the intellectual exchange the energy sciences networksupports could prove monumental &quot;when all our people there [overseas[ areable to collaborate and communicate with their colleagues here in a very easyway.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
