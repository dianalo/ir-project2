His ``Some LikeIt Hot'' and ``Sunset Boulevard'' appeared on the list.   ``I wish things would go forward to reconstruct those films asthey were, not colorized and not butchered by cuts.''   Also on the list was Frank Capra's ``Mr. Smith Goes toWashington,'' which starred Stewart.   ``The first thing that crossed my mind, is that I'm glad thatFrank is still with us and can enjoy his vindication,'' Stewartsaid. Capra has been in failing health at his home in La Quinta.   Stewart made his comments in Washington, D.C., before a visit tothe Senate to campaign for film preservation. He recalled thepremiere of the movie at Constitution Hall in 1939. Senators becamerestive at the film's depiction of political corruption.   The film broke during the screening, Stewart recalled, and by thetime Capra returned to his seat after climbing to the booth torepair it, ``half his audience was gone. ... The press wascompletely against the picture, too.''   The aim of the list, said Librarian of Congress James H.Billington in announcing the first 25, was to promote movies as anAmerican art form and generate public interest in preservation.   ``I think it's as good a list as we can expect the first timeout,'' said Dave Kehr, a member of the National Film PreservationBoard and chairman of the National Society of Film Critics. A boardof 13 film figures made the final selection, drawing from a thousandnominations from the public.   The major surprise among the selections for the National FilmRegistry was the ``The Learning Tree,'' a semi-autobiographical filmof a black boy's rural childhood by Gordon Parks, famed Lifemagazine photographer.   ``I'm surprised, pleasantly so,'' said Parks at his New Yorkresidence. ``I'm very happy. The film was very well received in itsrelease, and it's still playing in Europe and on television here.''   The National Film Registry is the outgrowth of protests byfilmmakers over colorization and editing for television of classicfilms. Congress last year passed the National Film Preservation Act,which called for the naming of 25 classic films annually for threeyears.   ``I'm delighted to be one of the 25, but I'm horrified at thenecessity of the act,'' said Stanley Donen, the director of themusical ``Singin' in the Rain.''   Donen said that the act will do nothing to keep broadcasters fromediting movies for length or duplicating them with poor qualitycontrol onto videocassettes.   Wilder was his usual acerbic self in calling for greaterprotection for films: ``The television people call in a butcher, whohas failed at the Ralphs grocery store, to supervise the cutting ofpictures so they can slip in the Noxema commercials. Frankly, nobodygives a ----.''   There were other surprises besides ``The Learning Tree.''   D.W. Griffith's mishmash of history, ``Intolerance,'' wasselected, but not his classic, ``The Birth of a Nation,'' perhapsbecause of its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan.   King Vidor's ``The Crowd'' was included but not his moreimpressive ``The Big Parade.'' John Ford Westerns are represented by``The Searchers'' and not his landmark ``Stagecoach.''   Among the missing: ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''; ``It's aWonderful Life''; ``It Happened One Night''; ``All about Eve'';``Shane''; ``Top Hat''; ``The African Queen''; ``Rebecca''; ``FromHere to Eternity.''   Besides Wilder, double selections were Victor Fleming, whodirected both ``Gone with the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of Oz'' in1939, and Ford, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``The Searchers.''   The top movies, listed alphabetically, were:   ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' 1946; ``Casablanca,'' 1942;``Citizen Kane,'' 1941; ``The Crowd,'' 1928; ``Dr. Strangelove; or,How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,'' 1964; ``TheGeneral,'' 1927; ``Gone With the Wind,'' 1939; ``The Grapes ofWrath,'' 1940; ``High Noon,'' 1952; ``Intolerance,'' 1916; ``TheLearning Tree,'' 1969, and ``The Maltese Falcon,'' 1941.
