Completes Buyout Of Texas Bank</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NCNB Corp. on Wednesday bought out the federalgovernment's 51 percent interest in NCNB Texas National Bank,completing the $1.32 billion purchase of the institution created inthe nation's costliest bank failure.   The buyout, announced 10 days ago, comes four years ahead of atimetable established last year when NCNB was selected to managethe 40 failed banks of First RepublicBank Corp.   In that deal, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB also got a five-yearoption to buy all of Texas' largest bank holding company, which has$27.9 billion in assets. NCNB changed the company's name to NCNBTexas at that time.   With the acquisition, NCNB becomes the nation's ninth-largestcommercial bank, with about $60 billion in assets and $43.2 billionin deposits.   NCNB paid $210 million for a 20 percent share of NCNB Texas onNov. 22, then accelerated its plans, paying $310 million for anadditional 29 percent on April 28 and $800 million for theremaining shares Wednesday.   The price gives a $270 million profit to the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which provided $840 million of the initialrecapitalization of First RepublicBank. The FDIC also is financingpart of Wednesday's purchase through a $320 million in a one-year,interest-bearing note.   In all, the government has estimated the First RepublicBankrescue will cost $3 billion.   Improved profits at the Texas institution led to NCNB's decisionto move up its purchase, the bank said last month. NCNB Texasearned $63.1 million in the second quarter, with $28.8 milliongoing to NCNB Corp.   Analysts said the buyout also removes some potential roadblocksto NCNB Texas acquiring other banks or thrifts as the state'stroubled financial industry is cleaned up.   Since entering the Texas market, NCNB Corp. has sold $410million worth of additional stock and seen its stock price climb toover $54 a share, more than double its share price on July 29,1988, when the FDIC announced the deal.</TEXT></DOC>
