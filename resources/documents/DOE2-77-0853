Both one- and two-dimensional laminateswere investigated. Damage-tolerant behavior was observed in several ofthe experimental compositions and was associated with fiber-pullout andcrack-deflection toughening mechanisms. The complex microstructure ofthe matrix phase is amenable to heat treatment. The fiber microstructureis apparently unaffected by heat treatment after hot pressing. The structureof the fiber/matrix interface is also complex and sensitive to both thematrix composition and to heat treatment after hot pressing. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
