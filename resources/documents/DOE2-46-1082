Data were collectedin the retraining course of actual plant operators at the BWR TrainingCenter in Japan. Analyses were performed to identify and classify errorsand to examine the causes and contributing factors of the observed errors.Error rates were estimated and compared with existing data. Quantificationof cognitive errors was also performed based on operators' response times.The results of the study were summarized as a basis for building a databank to be utilized for multiple purposes of probabilistic safety analysis,man-machine interface improvement and operator training.</TEXT></DOC>
