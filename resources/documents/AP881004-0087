The White House, meanwhile, tempered expressions of pleasure atthe release of the Indian in Beirut with ``the knowledge that nineinnocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon.''   Mithileshwar Singh, a Beirut University professor who is a legalresident of the United States, was turned over to the U.S.ambassador to Syria in Damascus today after being freed in Lebanonon Monday.   Singh, who is a diabetic, will fly to a U.S. military hospitalin Wiesbaden, West Germany, for medical treatment in the next fewdays, L. Paul Bremer, U.S. ambassador for counter-terrorism, saidtoday.   Reagan, in an exchange with reporters, did not explain howSingh's freedom was obtained. But he again ruled out any U.S. dealswith the captors, believed to be an pro-Iranian Islamic group.   He said trying to secure the release of the nine Americans heldin Lebanon ``has been a great problem for us and it's very much onour minds.''   Reagan declined to speculate on what move the United Statesmight make to win the release of the nine American hostages.   ``We've done no negotiating on that at all,'' he said, ``and I'mnot going to hazard a guess as to why they turned him loose _ notas long as we've still got hostages there,'' he said while posingfor pictures with Republican congressional leaders in the CabinetRoom.   Asked if he thought Iran was attempting to manipulate theoutcome of the U.S. presidential election, Reagan smiled and said,``Well, if they are, I hope they're on the right side.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, asked about the politicalimplications of the situation, said, ``I just hope for the sake ofthe hostages they are released today, without any reference to theelection. Every day they stay there is another day of hell. And Iassume that we are not concerned about the outcome of the election,but with the hostages.''   In an interview published today in The New York Times, thespiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captorsof foreign hostages was quoted as saying it was ``not yet the righttime for the American hostages to be freed.''   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also was quoted assaying the fate of the hostages ``would have to wait for theoutcome of the American presidential election.'' He said Iranpreferred to deal with the Republicans.   Pressed to discuss what options are available for U.S. officialsattempting to get the hostages released, Reagan said, ``I can justtell you that this has been a big problem for us. It's somethingvery much in our minds. ... I just can't talk any further aboutit.''   In 1985, the president secretly approved U.S. weapons sales toIran in an arrangement that was supposed to encourage moderation inTehran and free captive Americans.   When the plot surfaced in 1986 it produced the greatest uproarin Reagan's eight-year presidency.   In a prepared statement read earlier in the day to reporters,White House spokesman Bob Hall said, ``We are pleased at theannouncement that Mr. Singh has been freed by his captors.   ``We are obviously happy for him, his family and friends. Ourpleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nineinnocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon,''the statement read.   In television interviews today, Bremer reiterated Reaganadministration statements that ``we've not made any deals and we'renot going to make any deals'' to gain the hostages' freedom.   Bremer said on the ``CBS This Morning'' that American officialshave spoken to Singh only briefly and have no indication that hewas carrying any messages from his captors.   Singh, in a brief session with reporters at the Syrian ForeignMinistry in Damascus today, said the three American educators whowere abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in hiscaptivity.   American diplomats who took custody of Singh were hoping thefreed hostage could give them information about the nine Americansstill held in Lebanon.   ``We are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has anyinformation to share with us about the welfare of the hostages whoremain,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said onMonday.   Nine Americans and eight other Westerners, including TerryWaite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England, are believedliving in captvity in Lebanon.   Sources in Syria's Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Singh was greeted at the ministry late this morningby U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian and Syrian Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour.   Syrian forces are in effective control of areas of Lebanon, awar-torn country in which Americans have been the target ofterrorists. Except for a few diplomats, U.S. citizens are understrict instruction from the State Department to keep away.   Singh was believed to have been held by the Islamic Jihad, apro-Iranian group.   Singh is a 60-year-old visiting professor at Beirut UniversityCollege.   Asked if there were indications other hostages would bereleased, Mrs. Oakley said: ``No. This is all we have.''   Although he is an Indian citizen, Singh was connected to theUnited States because he was a permanent resident and ``wasassociated'' with the Americans who taught at the Beirut college.   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and threeAmerican teachers said they would free one of their captives at thewest Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency forPalestinian refugees.   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from IslamicJihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwrittenstatement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
