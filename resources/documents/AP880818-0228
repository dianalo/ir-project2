Thank you, I think you're about as happy tonight as I am. Andthank you, my dear friend Louis Sullivan, for that very kindintroduction.   And thank all of you for that warm welcome.   You know, I've always felt I was the world's luckiest woman. NowI know it. I'm married to an extraordinarily special man. I havefive well, happy, doing children, all of whom married wonderfulpeople. And 10-plus perfect grandchildren.   I have caring, loyal friends, such as yourselves.   I've had the opportunity to work for a more literate America.And I care deeply about other problems, such as leukemia, thehomeless, and many other problems facing us.   You know, I've loved George Bush almost since the day I laideyes on him. Now I realize that won't get him a lot of votes, solet me explain why I respect him.   First of all, George was always there when the children neededhim.   By now, you may be getting tired of hearing all the importantjobs George has held. And he has. All those jobs have demandedtremendous energy and commitment from him.   But do you know what I respect about George? In spite of allthose jobs, our family has always felt an enormous part of hislife. The children and I have always felt as important as the workhe was doing. And this has given our children confidence.   I remember, I called George one day when the boys were small andI said, ``I'm desperate. I don't know what to do. Your son's introuble again. He just hit a ball through the neighbor's upstairswindow.''   And George said, ``Wow, what a hit.'' And then he said, ``Didyou get the ball back?''   A reporter once asked what his proudest accomplishment was. Andhe paused a moment and then said, ``Our kids still come home.'' Hemeant it.   George is always there when someone needs him.   I won't give you great detail, but let me give you an example.   Once, when he is business, my husband had to fire a man who wasan alcoholic. He didn't pass this painful task off to someone else;he did it himself.   But George just didn't fire the man. First, as support he wentwith him to tell his wife. And she said, ``Thank heavens, for 10years I have worried and wondered why no one knew.'' It was as if aburden had been lifted from her.   And then do you know what George did? He attended A.A. meetingswith the man. And today that man is a friend and supporter of myhusband's. He may be in the audience tonight.   George has always been there when I needed him, too.   The hardest thing we ever faced together was the loss of achild. I was very strong over the months we were trying to saveher. At least, I thought I was. Maybe I was just pretending.   But when she was gone, I fell apart. But George wouldn't let meretreat into my grief. He held me in his arms and he made me shareit and accept that his sorrow was as great as my own.   He simply wouldn't allow my grief to divide us apart, push usapart, which is what happens so often when there's a loss like that.   As long as I live, I will respect my husband for the strength ofhis understanding.   I guess what I'm really trying to say to each of you heretonight is that you should feel proud of what you've done at thisconvention.   And what you've done is this _ you've nominated for thepresidency of the United States a man who is as strong and caringand decent as America herself.   Thank you very, very much.</TEXT><HEAD>End Barbara Bush Text _ 1 Take</HEAD></DOC>
