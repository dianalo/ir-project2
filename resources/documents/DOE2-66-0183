<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0183 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes an electric storage battery comprising (1) a containerdefining a compartment containing gas-generating electro-chemical meansfor producing an electric current, and (2) check/relief valve means operativelyassociated with the container upon closing to isolate the electrochemicalmeans from the ambient atmosphere and upon opening to vent the compartmentwhen the internal pressure of the gas generated in the compartment exceedsa predetermined superatmospheric pressure the improvement wherein thevalve comprises: a housing defining a vent chamber and including a valveseat projecting into the chamber, the seat having a sloping exteriorsealing surface; an inlet in one end of the housing for admitting gasinto the chamber from the compartment; means for exhausting the gas fromthe chamber to the environment; and a sealing member in the chamber circumscribingthe inlet for controlling the internal pressures at which the openingand closing occurs and as necessary, for dumping relatively large volumesof the gas without excessive build-up of the internal pressure in thecontainer. The sealing member comprising an annular elastomeric skirtsecured at one end and having a tubular portion extending from the oneend above the inlet so as to provide an internal annular surface exposedto the internal gas pressure and a sealing edge on the interior of theother end of the tubular portion circumferentially sealing engaging thesloping exterior sealing surface when the valve is closed</TEXT></DOC>
