The answer depends onyour income and marital status and whether you itemize deductions.   Use the simplest form _ the one-page Form 1040EZ _ if you aresingle, you have no other dependents, you don't itemize and yourtaxable income (gross income minus any personal exemption) is lessthan $50,000. Your income must have come solely from wages, tips ortaxable scholarships, except for up to $400 interest.   The two-page 1040A is for any filing status (married, single,head of household), allows any number of exemptions but no itemizeddeductions and is restricted to those whose taxable income is under$50,000. But within that income limit you may have, in addition towages, tips and scholarships, any amount of interest, dividends andunemployment compensation.   A 1040A filer must attach Schedule 1 if an Individual RetirementAccount deduction or child-care credit is claimed, or if dividendsor taxable interest exceed $400.   The long Form 1040 is required for filers who don't qualify for ashorter one. That includes, for example, anyone who received taxableSocial Security benefits or made estimated tax payments in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
