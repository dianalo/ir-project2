Lotus filed suit against California-based BorlandInternational Inc., claiming that Borland's upstart Quattrosoftware infringes on the copyright of Lotus's best-selling1-2-3 spreadsheet.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, which includes a similar complaint against SantaCruz Operation Inc., another California software maker, comeson the heels of Lotus's copyright infringement victory lastweek over Paperback Software International.   Legal experts say that last week's decision, while notensuring future success in court, has strengthened Lotus'sposition. &quot;Lotus is now in an extremely powerful position toenforce its copyright against Borland and others,&quot; says LeeGesmer, a partner at the law firm of Lucash, Gesmer andamp;Updegrove, a specialist in copyright law.   Regardless of what happens, Lotus's aggressive posturecould deter other potential rivals from trying to invade itsturf.   Borland and Quattro Pro were obvious targets for Lotus'snext legal attack because Quattro has become a hot product.While Lotus dominates the spreadsheet business with a marketshare of about 60%, Borland claims that Quattro Pro iswinning some business from Lotus. In heavy nationalover-the-counter trading yesterday, Borland stock plummeted$4.375, or more than 20%, to close at $17 a share. Lotus'sstock closed at $34.625 a share over the counter, down 12.5cents.   &quot;The heart of the case for us is the similarity in menus,&quot;or screens and keystrokes that the user sees and uses, saysLotus general counsel Tom Lemberg, noting Lotus's specialinterest in Quattro Pro, Borland's latest version of itsQuattro spreadsheet. &quot;Without the Quattro Pro, we wouldn'thave a case.&quot;   In terms of keystrokes, Lotus, for instance, claims thatQuattro Pro's use of the &quot;C&quot; key to denote what type ofcurrency to use on a spreadsheet, as well as the use of &quot;FR&quot;for file retrieve, constitute infringements on Lotus's 1-2-3.   &quot;We believe that the Quattro software is of originaldesign,&quot; responds Borland spokesman Dick O'Donnell, &quot;and ifyou ask Quattro users why they use our software, they'll tellyou it's because of the features they get that they can't getelsewhere.&quot;   Borland has specifically targeted Lotus's 1-2-3 with itsQuattro Pro. Borland sells Quattro Pro for just $99 to ownersof 1-2-3, compared with the normal Quattro Pro price of $495.   Borland, anticipating Lotus's suit, actually fired thefirst shot. Friday, the company filed for a declaratoryjudgment in federal court in San Jose, Calif., stating thatQuattro doesn't infringe on Lotus's copyright. Because ofBorland's lightning strike, says Rick Sherlund, an analystwith Goldman Sachs, the case will most likely proceed inCalifornia rather than before the federal judge in Boston whoruled in Lotus's favor in the Paperback case. &quot;It was ashrewd move,&quot; says Mr. Sherlund.   Santa Cruz Operation said the software Lotus has legallyattacked, called SCO Professional, is a spreadsheet packagefor a multi-user UNIX operating system. &quot;We haven't seen thecomplaint, but, to the best of our knowledge, we haven'tviolated any copyrights,&quot; said company spokeswoman JanetMorton. She added that SCO Professional has been selling inthe multi-user arena since 1986, while Lotus only recentlyentered the UNIX-spreadsheet market.   &quot;We have every intention of appealing&quot; last week'sdecision, said Michael Burdick, a vice president formarketing of Paperback Software International of Berkeley,Calif. &quot;The judge's extending of copyright law to userinterface has created broad adverse effects on the computersoftware industry, as is evidenced by the Lotus-Borland suitjust filed. The legal wrangling has already begun.&quot;   The suit underscores how litigious the software industryhas become. Apple Computer Inc., for example, has lawsuitspending against both Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.,charging their products infringe on Apple copyrights. Manysmall developers of software have decried the trend, claimingthat the lawsuits stifle the creativity and entrepreneurialspirit that helped build the software industry. But thecompanies filing the suits counter that they are simplyprotecting their property from competitors who seek tobenefit unfairly by copying unique features.</TEXT></DOC>
