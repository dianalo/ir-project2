Mohamad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, also reportedarmy counterattacks around the provincial towns of Khost, Kandaharand Herat, but gave no details.   He said 53 people had killed in all the operations, including 37rebels.   Amani said nine people were killed by the rockets in Kabul. Twoexploded in a residential area about 1,000 yards from theContinental Hotel.   On Tuesday, the government claimed the insurgents were preparingmajor assaults on Kabul and other cities.   A statement by the Supreme Defense Council on Wednesday said thearmy was countering a ``heinous plan'' by Pakistan to aid theguerrillas at Jalalabad, which has been under siege since March 7.   Amani said both air force and artillery units were involved inthe fighting at Jalalabad, an important provincial capital 75 mileseast of Kabul and 45 miles from the border with Pakistan.   On a former government tree farm at Ghaziabad, 25 miles east ofJalalabad, the guerrilla faction led by Younis Khalis released 40Afghan soldiers on Wednesday.   Guerrillas have been accused of killing prisoners, and insurgentleaders fear that has made many soldiers reluctant to change sides,even though the Afghan army's desertion rate is high.   ``They are not convinced ... we will not shoot them,'' said AoulGul, the commander holding Ghaziabad. He said the prisoners werefreed to ``counter propaganda that we are killing the people weget.''   Diplomatic sources and witnesses said Wednesday's air strikeswere the most intensive in weeks.   Fighter-bombers were seen leaving Kabul and the nearby Baghramair base in groups of two and three for the Paghman Mountains, aguerrilla sanctuary northwest of the capital.   Thirty to 35 aircraft took part in operations that began at dawnand lasted about 90 minutes, witnesses reported.   Some aircraft headed for Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabadis the capital. The assault on Jalalabad was the first majorguerrilla attack after the withdrawal of Soviet military forces fromAfghanistan was completed Feb. 15.   Jalalabad, the country's fifth-largest city, is consideredstrategically important because of its nearness to Pakistan, wherethe main guerrilla groups are based. The United States and Pakistanprovide most of the support for the insurgents.   The Soviet-sponsored government claims it broke the siege ofJalalabad last month, but official Kabul radio has reported fightingaround the city for two weeks. It said shells and rockets fired intoresidential areas Tuesday killed four people, including twochildren, and wounded eight.   On Tuesday, the government said insurgents planned simultaneous``massive attacks'' on Kabul and other major cities in mid-July. Itasked the United Nations to intervene.   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said: ``The grave consequences,which will include bloodshed ... and destruction, will be shoulderedby the Pakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack.''   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December1979. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistanwhen the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began in May 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
