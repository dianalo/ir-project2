TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, packing a pistoland dressed in a military uniform, jousted and joked Thursday withabout 15 Israeli journalists, telling them: ``We are not asking forthe moon.''   The unsual encounter, arranged by Israeli peace campaigner AbieNathan, took place in an Egyptian government guest house flying aPalestinian flag.   It came after a week of intense diplomacy initiated by the SovietUnion and aimed at bringing Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization to the negotiating table.   ``I hope this will help both of us to understand our points ofview,'' said Arafat.   His message was that the PLO's quest for negotiations was sincereand not a tactical maneuver as claimed by Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir.   But Arafat gave no ground on issues of substance, such as hisdemand for a Palestinian state, which Israeli leaders oppose, andthe right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homeland.   He attacked the Israeli government for refusing to deal with thePLO. ``To be an ostrich will not serve anybody,'' he said.   Arafat said he saw progress in what he described as the indirectnegotiations that took place Wednesday when he and Israeli ForeignMinister Moshe Arens met separately with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze.   ``There is a little step advanced (forward) in the Israeliposition,'' Arafat said, speaking in English. He did not elaborate.   Waving his arms excitedly, Arafat also said Israel's Cabinet hadauthorized the Mossad intelligence agency to assassinate him. Hesaid the plan was code-named ``Best Hit.''   Asked if he was worried about his image in Israel, Arafat said,``I am not worried about my image with the Israeli government. I amworried about the Israeli people.''   Asked about his past references to Israel's government as a``military junta,'' Arafat said Israeli leaders constantly calledhim a terrorist. ``You are always calling me a terrorist, terrorist,terrorist,'' he said.   The guerrilla leader, wearing a black checkered kaffiehheaddress, was flanked by Mohammed Milhelm, former mayor of the WestBank town of Halhoul who was deported from Israel in 1980, andYasser Abd Rabbo, a member of the Moscow-oriented Democratic Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine.   Arafat angrily interrupted an Israeli journalist who told himthat it was ``in your interest'' to stop anti-Israeli violence inthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and halt guerrillainfiltrations from Lebanon. The journalist said this would improvethe PLO's credibility about its desire for peace.   ``You have to stop the crimes of the Israeli army,'' retortedArafat, ticking off figures in which he claimed 619 Palestinians hadbeen killed and 31,000 wounded, including 3,600 Palestinian womanwho miscarried as a result of inhaling army tear gas.   The figures were far higher than official and unofficial Israelicounts, which put the death toll at less than 400 since Dec. 8, 1987.   Arafat did say, however, the PLO was considering what hedescribed as an Israeli request for a cease fire along the borderwith Israeli.   There were also light moments, in which Arafat joked about a 1984law that bans contacts with the PLO. It carries a maximum penalty ofthree years in prison.   At one point, Nathan, who is facing trial for an earlier meetingwith the PLO leader in Tunis, asked Arafat to use his influence inaccounting for five Israeli soldiers who are missing or captured asa result of Israel's involvement in Lebanon.   Arafat asked Nathan to meet him later, and then quipped: ``Orthey will punish you if you discuss with me?''   Arafat also joked with Amira Hassan, a reporter for the Israelidaily Hadashot, who insisted on asking a question in Arabic insteadof English. ``This is democracy,'' said Arafat.   ``He is a Palestinian with a sense of humor. The man is quitefunny,'' Israeli journalist Amnon Abramovitch said after the meetingin an interview broadcast on Israel army radio.   Representatives from most of Israel's daily newspapers attendedthe meeting along with a few foreign journalists. Some Israelis wereex-military officers, including Amos Gilboa, a former army generaland senior intelligence official.   Nathan, who arranged the meeting to encourage other Israelis tojoin in the dialogue with the PLO, said it was unclear whether theIsraeli journalists violated the Israel ban. He said authoritieshave not prosecuted cases in which Israelis attended newsconferences with foreign journalists.   On Thursday, Israeli authorities banned Arafat's statements fromIsrael's state-run television. The Israel TV crew did not attendThursday's session but did shoot an earlier news conference.   Uri Porath, director general of Israeli TV, said Thursday no suchinterviews would be allowed ``as long as the state's official policyforbids it, and certainly as long as there is a law against it.''</TEXT></DOC>
