A series of releases with ECM records of West Germanycatapulted Jarrett to international acclaim.;    These records came with long,improvised sections that ranged from gospel to jazz and classical, allexpressed with Jarrett's stunning technical prowess and emotion. Now, after anumber of years spent recording in various contexts -- from baroque music towork with various jazz collaborators -- he's back playing solo again.;   Jarrett performs tonight at 8 in Zellerbach Hall, University of California,Berkeley. For tickets, $13-$22, call (415) 642-9988.; -- Harry Sumrall;WARTIME DRAMA IN ACT'S '1918'; OSCAR-WINNING playwright Horton Foote is in themidst of a nine-play series of dramas he calls &quot;The Orphans' Home Cycle.&quot; Theseventh in that group, titled &quot;1918,&quot; gets a West Coast premiere production atthe American Conservatory Theater, with previews beginning Tuesday. Openingnight is Feb. 13 at the Stage Door Theater, 420 Mason St. in San Francisco.;    &quot;1918&quot; deals with the great influenza epidemic of that year and eventssurrounding World War I.

So it hasbeen with Tracy Rhoades, one of the Bay Area's more striking dancers, whobegan with solos -- &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; and the haunting &quot;Requiem&quot; -- about being agay man in a time of plague.;    Last summer, he expanded his horizons andformed a company. Its name, Exploding Roses, is an image of energy awarenessthat he takes from meditation: &quot;It means getting rid of energy that you don'tneed and having it turn to gold.&quot;;    Its first major work will debut on theBay Area Dance Series this weekend. Set to no less a score than Bach's&quot;Magnificat,&quot; it's filled with images of healing, Rhoades says.;    ExplodingRoses shares the program with the High Risk Group, a gay men's dancecollective. Performances are at 8 tonight-Saturday and at 3 p.m. Sunday inLaney College's theater, 900 Fallon St., Oakland. For tickets, $10-$12, call(415) 748-3141.; -- Judith Green; PAUL, JOANNE PLAY 'MR. AND MRS.'; THE BIGnews on the movie scene this weekend is the arrival of James Ivory's splendid&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot; adaptation with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward as thepious, uptight Kansas City couple of the title.;    Unfortunately, the filmopens only in San Francisco and Berkeley today, and isn't scheduled for SouthBay theaters until next Friday. But those who make the trek will discover animpeccably acted period piece with the usual Ivory extras -- superb music,production design and cinematography. It's a slow-moving chronicle -- closerreally to a series of interlocking vignettes -- but it weaves an undeniablespell and somehow manages to be at once wistful and nasty.; Glenn Lovell; THEPROUD MEN FROM PLEASANTON; LEST anyone write off the Bay Area's suburbs as avast musical wasteland containing about as much soul as a half-empty can ofCheez Whiz, consider the remarkable case of Field Trip, possibly the mostpromising new all-around rock 'n' roll band working the club scene.;    Theseyoung men are from Pleasanton -- and proud of it. (So proud, in fact, they putthe Pleasanton city arch on their album cover.) Over the course of twostunningly precocious and lyrical albums on Slash/Warner Bros., they've earneda well-deserved rep for great folk-tinged pop songs. Last year's &quot;Headgear&quot;album was one of the 10 best pop discs of the year.;    Saturday, take theTrip at the El Rio, 3158 Mission St., San Francisco. Helen Keller Plaid,another local fave, kicks off the show at 9 p.m. Tickets are $5. Call (415)282-3325.
