(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opponents have finally won the fight toblock construction of the world's largest hazardous waste treatmentplant after a decade of protests and legal battles.   ``We're planning a party, a big party,'' said Steve Irving, theBaton Rouge lawyer who handled the opposition.   The final blow for the $135 million plant, planned by the ITCorp. of Torrance, Calif., came quietly when a court-ordereddeadline for appeals passed Tuesday.   ``IT did not intend to appeal,'' company attorney MaureenHarbourt said. ``That's it.''   The plant would have been built beside the Mississippi River nearBurnside and next to the antebellum Houmas House, frequently used asa set for movies.   The lack of an appeal apparently means IT is writing off $19million already spent on the project, including the purchase of1,100 acres, the development of engineering plans and other costs.   Paul H. Templet, secretary of the state Deparatment ofEnvironmental Quality, revoked the company's hazardous waste permiton May 8. Under law, IT had 30 days to appeal.   Templet said he rescinded the permit because the company did notprove the plant would not contaminate groundwater and create otherenvironmental problems.   The permit, issued to the hazardous waste management firm eightyears ago, had been challenged in a lawsuit filed by Save OurSelves, a coalition of environmental and citizens groups who saidthe plant would create more problems than it solved.   ``When we started out, this was a state program,'' said Irving.``State officials were involved. All the wheels were greased.''   ``Part of the game plan was to ram it down our throats,'' hesaid, ``make it an `existing facility.'''   The opponents successfully stalled the permit process long enoughto keep the plant from establishing a legal standing.   Then they won a ruling that IT violated the state ethics code bypreparing its own feasibility study of the site for the state.   ``We knew that if we deprived them of making a quick killing, itwould die of its own weight,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
