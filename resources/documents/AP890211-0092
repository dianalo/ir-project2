William Seidman, a tough-talking bankregulator who looks a little like Daddy Warbucks, is braced for hisgood name to get splattered quickly now that President Bush has madehim deposit insurance czar and plopped the savings and loan crisisin his lap.   In more than three years at the helm of the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which backs commercial bank deposits, Seidman, 67,has acquired a reputation as a straight shooter.   When his agency announces good news such as a jump in bankprofits, he's more likely to focus on negatives, such as an uptickin bad loans in the Northeast or banks' growing dependence onleveraged buyouts.   Over the past year, congressional committees, unhappy with whatthey viewed as overly-rosy estimates from Sandamp;L regulators at theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, increasingly have turned to Seidmanfor information about savings and loans, even though they weren'tunder his jurisdiction.   ``His personality is very blunt. He's a no-nonsense guy and hedoesn't mince words,'' said Robert Litan, a banking expert at theBrookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``I think a lot ofpoliticians appreciate that.''   ``Seidman is an old hand and has the confidence of people inWashington,'' explained Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member ofthe House Banking Committee. ``And he's been right on the issue.Unlike the bank board he has not had to change his tune every fewmonths.''   Although Seidman has presided over the worst three years for bankfailures since the Depression, he also has had two importantadvantages not enjoyed by M. Danny Wall, his counterpart for Sandamp;Ls: alarge, experienced staff that had escaped Reagan-era budget cuts,and a solvent insurance fund.   Now that Seidman, under Bush's plan to resolve the savings andloan crisis, gets actual, not just defacto, authority over Sandamp;Ls, hemay be in for tougher times.   Many people, including the FDIC chairman himself, think the eraof good feelings could quickly end as the FDIC wrestles with theintractable thrift problem.   ``I think you will shortly be doing a story on this guy's themost inept, mud-covered regulator we've ever seen. How could we haveever thought he's reasonably good,'' Seidman, a short, nearly-bald,craggy-featured man, predicted in a recent interview.   Commercial banking, despite all the failures, is relativelyhealthy, posting record high earnings last year. The savingsindustry, by any measure, is ailing. About 350 of the 3,000 Sandamp;Ls inthe nation are insolvent. The business lost more money in 1988 thanat any time in 50 years. And, only one in four institutions now haveenough money invested by their owners to meet the stricter capitalstandards Bush's plan would require in two years.   ``We're going ... into a very difficult situation to which everyanswer will be painful ... and which contains all kinds of boobytraps and not many rewards,'' Seidman said. ``There aren't going tobe any miracles.''   Others aren't as pessimistic, at least about the prospects forSeidman's reputation.   ``Seidman is coming in at the right time,'' said former SenateBanking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, who retired this yearafter 30 years in the Senate. ``People realize Sandamp;Ls are in horribleshape. ... It's like coming in to coach a football team that has hada disastrous season. ... If he wins three or four games, he's agenius.''   Some in Washington think Seidman is already a genius for havingdoubled his power and simultaneously protected the bank insurancefund from being raided to pay for Sandamp;L problems.   When asked, in the months leading up to the announcement ofBush's Sandamp;L proposal, whether he wanted jurisdiction over thriftinstitutions, Seidman had a stock answer, ``We prefer to go italone, but we're willing to help if asked.''   Even now he insists, ``It was not a job we wanted. We never askedfor it. ... There was no hidden agenda for us to end up where we arenow.''   But, a senior bank board official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said, ``He had a very good set of cards and he playedthem very well.''   ``In a city where turf is your measure of success, he's veryquietly amassing a very big one and very coyly as well,'' saidBarton Naylor, a former Senate Banking Committee aide, now on thestaff of the Investor Responsibility Research Center.   Seidman's strong suit in the struggle has been his long-standingties to the Republican establishment dating back to theadministration of Gerald Ford, a boyhood friend from Grand Rapids,Mich.   When Ford became president, he hired Seidman, head of afamily-owned accounting firm, to be a White House assistant foreconomic affairs.   It was Seidman who interviewed Alan Greenspan, now chairman ofthe Federal Reserve Board, to determine whether Ford should nominatethe economist as chairman of the president's Council of EconomicAdvisers.   During the Ford years, Seidman worked closely with James A. BakerIII, then an assistant secretary of commerce, and with RichardDarman, then a young Baker aide. That's the same Baker who issecretary of state now, the same Darman who is head of the Office ofManagement and Budget. Seidman traveled often to Langley, Va., toreview Central Intelligence Agency economic reports with GeorgeBush, then CIA director.   He has known Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady for 30years.   ``Darman called me up the other day and said, `Now that you'vegot all your proteges in office, what are you going to do?'''Seidman said. ``I said, `I'm going to retire and enjoy it.'''   But that won't be until the administration's Sandamp;L program is wellunder way, he said.   Another asset that helps Seidman win over Democrats is hispragmatism, according to Kenneth Guenther of the Independent BankersAssociation of America.   ``He's been around the block four of five times. ... He's not anideologue,'' Guenther said.   That's obvious from Seidman's successful effort to block severalSandamp;L proposals pushed by Bush's more conservative advisers.   When word of the Treasury Department's proposal to impose adirect fee on depositors leaked, Seidman dubbed it ``the reversetoaster plan. Instead of getting a toaster when you open an account,you give them one.''   The remark reportedly infuriated White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu, but Seidman isn't apologetic.   ``I wasn't trying to be obstreperous. On the other hand, I didthink it was a very bad idea and I thought it might be better to tryto deal with it with humor rather than analysis,'' he said.   Seidman also is fighting an idea, advocated by Greenspan andothers, that lowering the $100,000 deposit insurance limit wouldgive bank and Sandamp;L customers incentive to make sure theirinstitutions are soundly managed.   Bush wants the Treasury Department to study the issue for a year.   ``Who in the world wants to get people thinking in a public waythat they're going to change deposit insurance?'' Seidman asked.</TEXT></DOC>
