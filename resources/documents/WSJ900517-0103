Theballyhoo of some environmentalists reminds me of Mark Twain'sremark: &quot;There is something fascinating about science. Onegets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such atrifling investment of facts.&quot;   To make sweeping, irresponsible statements about theenvironment is not to convince others of the righteousness ofthe cause. It is merely to sacrifice credibility. When theEarth itself is the issue, none of us benefit from such amethod.</LP><TEXT>   John Warner   Kenney, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
