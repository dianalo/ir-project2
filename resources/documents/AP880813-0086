Party. More than 500 separate bashes are scheduled forconvention week, enough to send George Bush into the presidentialfray on a tidal wave of Hurricane rum punch. The Republicans plansome business, for sure. But, after all, this is New Orleans.   ``New Orleans will use anything for an excuse for a party. Nomatter what happens, there's a party,'' said Doris Finney, acelebrant Friday night at, well, a party. ``Bring on theRepublicans. New Orleans will party all week.''   Finney was taking in one of the more staid events, by localstandards, a family affair at City Park featuring fireworks, gospelmusic and tunes from ``The Enforcers,'' a band of sheriff'sdeputies rocking out in full uniform.   Jambalaya went for a buck a bowl, and Mayor Sidney Barthelemydished out some New Orleans understatement: ``We've showedeverybody,'' he announced, ``that we could put on the greatestevent in the history of this country.''   Hyperbole may be the hallmark of good times here. ``It'swonderful. I am 200 percent Republican,'' said Alice Mongeau,watching the colored shells burst over the park. And her city?``Sure, it's Republican too,'' she said.   Not quite. Democrats outnumber Republicans by better than5-to-1, and Barthelemy liked Jesse Jackson, not exactly a GeorgeBush soulmate. But in the Crescent City, ideology is not about tostand in the way of a good time.   ``We're talking about hospitality,'' said Sheriff Charles Foti,host of the City Park party. Unusual for a sheriff to throw aparty? ``Sure it's unusual,'' he said, chewing on an unlit cigar.``This is an unusual town.''   In some sections it's a downright kinky town. In the bawdyFrench Quarter, where strip joints vie with jazz joints, merchantswere waiting anxiously to see if political conservatives like toloosen up. Early results were mixed.   ``There's a lot of people out here, but they ain't going inanywhere,'' bemoaned Manny Moreland, the doorman at Papa Joe's, aclub on Bourbon Street where female impersonators dance nearlynaked. ``Maybe they're afraid to.''   Not all were timid. ``We had a few delegates come in; they hadtheir badges on,'' allowed Moreland. ``From New York. Goodtippers.''   It was a similar story across the street at the Unisex club,where actual women do the writhing but the early crowd _ that is,pre-1 a.m. _ was a tad thin. ``They're just walking the streetright now,'' said doorman Barry Whatley. ``But we'll catch 'emlater _ after they've had a few Hurricanes.''   Bill Ahle, manager of Pat O'Brien's, the home of the Hurricane,was all for that. ``We ordered extra stock to get us through theweek,'' he said. The stock is equal measures of cocktail punch andrum. The effect is powerful.   But getting hammered and looking at strippers is not the onlygame in town. There are riverboat cruises and jazz brunches,fund-raiser receptions and state delegation dinners. Six groupshave rented out the stately Museum of Art for private affairs thisweek, including a masked ball.   The convention master schedule lists everything from a PlatformCommittee reception on page one to an open house with the Women'sOpera Guild Association on page 48. In between, comedian RichLittle will entertain the Conservative Victory Committee ball, theheads of 30 Fortune 500 companies will do brunch and a 500-memberchoir will let loose at a prayer breakfast.   In their spare time, the Republicans will nominate theircandidate. And on Bourbon Street, the hawkers will keep on hoping.   ``It's a working convention for these people, I know that,''said Helen Cavanaugh, a waitress at the French Casino strip joint.``But maybe after it's over some of 'em will stay around and havefun.''</TEXT></DOC>
