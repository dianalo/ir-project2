The release rate was found to be proportionalto the square of the concentration of D in solution. The second-orderkinetics show the release is limited by molecular recombination of Don the surface. The recombination coefficient (K) measured for cleansurfaces can be described by K = K/sub 0/ exp(Q/sub K//kT) with K/sub0/ = 10/sup -21/ cm/sup 4//s and Q/sub K/ = (0.69+-0.06) eV. These recombinationcoefficients are orders of magnitude larger than those previously reportedfor iron. A model for K is presented in which the rate limiting stepis the recombination and desorption of D chemisorbed on the surface andwhich agrees closely with the measured values. Controlled dosing of thesamples with oxygen showed that submonolayer oxygen coverages cause largereductions in the D release rate.</TEXT></DOC>
