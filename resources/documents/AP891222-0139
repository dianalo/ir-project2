Manuel AntonioNoriega attacked Quarry Heights, site of the U.S. military'sSouthern Command today. Assailants tried to assassinate theU.S.-installed vice president, Ricardo Arias Calderon.   Members of pro-Noriega Dignity Battalions opened fire on Arias'car shortly after he left the National Assembly building, accordingto Arias aide Teni de Obaldia.   De Obaldia, reached at Arias' home by telephone, said Ariaswasn't injured but that two of his aides were wounded. He saidArias was with the wounded aides at Gorgas Hospital, a U.S.military hospital near Southern Command headquarters.   Arias was installed as first vice president shortly after theU.S. attack on Panama began at midnight Tuesday. He was declared awinner in elections in May that Noriega, the military dictator,declared null.   Fighting was heavy for about an hour around the Southern Commandcenter, which controls all U.S. forces in South and Central America.   Mortars were launched from railroad tracks below SouthernCommand headquarters at Quarry Heights, overlooking Panama City, atabout 11:25 a.m. Snipers were reported in the hills above, and thesound of helicopters and machine-gun fire could be heard overhead.   U.S. military officials and journalists took cover under tablesas the building they were in shook.   Witnesses in the area said the target of the attack appeared tobe two U.S.-occupied Panamanian government buildings below QuarryHeights. About a dozen pro-Noriega men attacked U.S. soldiers atthe secret police headquarters and the building that housesPanama's transportation department, the witnesses said by telephone.   By 12:30, fighting had died down.   Elsewhere, the Panamanian Defense Forces barracks in the westerncity of David, 200 miles west of Panama City, raised white flagsand surrendered this morning, residents of that city said bytelephone.   U.S. troops battled stubborn bands of Panamanian fighters in thechaotic capital, where fighting intensified late Thursday as U.S.warplanes bombed enemy positions.   On the third day of what was originally planned as a three-dayoperation, President Bush told Congress he could not predict howlong it would last. U.S. military commander Jim Snell said it couldtake months to clear the capital of Noriega loyalists and weapons.   But this morning, some remaining pockets of resistance appearedresigned to defeat.   ``It's clear that the gringos are in control of everything. Wedon't have the strength they have. We don't have any guidelines. Wedon't know where Noriega, our commander, is,'' said a pro-Noriegamunicipal official at the Tinajitas barracks in the northeasternneighborhood of San Miguelito.   The official, who refused to give his name, said supporters ofthe elusive Noriega had run out of munitions and could provide noresistance when U.S. troops rumbled into the neighborhood Thursdaynight.   Panamanian forces who had controlled several posts along theCosta Rican border in the province of Chiriqui fled today afterrumors spread that U.S. troops were on their way, said JuanBarrantes, a Costa Rican border official.   In Washington, the Organization of American States this morning``deeply deplored'' the invasion, which has killed 22 Americans,and called for withdrawal of U.S. forces. The resolution wasapproved on a 20-to-1 vote with the United States voting against itand six members abstaining.   Three Americans were missing, and Noriega's whereabouts was amystery. U.S. soldiers were too busy with snipers, andhouse-to-house searches to challenge looters who had helpedthemselves to everything from designer underwear to gleaming BMWs.   ``There are pockets of stiff resistance in the city,'' U.S.Embassy spokeswoman Jan Edmonson said today by telephone. ``Andalso there's just the great element of fear. These people are goingthrough parts of the city in just mobs, breaking windows, enteringprivate homes, looting at will.''   The newly installed U.S.-backed president, Guillermo Endara,admitted in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' todaythat he cannot safely walk the streets but claimed he had the``wholehearted support'' of the people.   ``We would need twice as many soldiers if we were to take overevery small garrison in this country,'' a U.S. Army officer said,on condition of anonymity.   Spurred by a $1 million bounty offered by President Bush forNoriega's arrest, Panamanians reported sightings of the generalthroughout the capital.   There were rumors he was holding out at the Tinajitas garrison,in northeastern Panama City. One Israeli television report said thegeneral was spotted on the resort island of Contadora, 40 miles offthe Pacific coast. It said he was preparing to escape to Nicaragua.   U.S. soldiers who stormed the ``Witch House'' on Wednesday, oneof Noriega's residences, found cigarettes smoldering and believethey missed the Panamanian fugitive by minutes, military sourcessay.   The Witch House was filled with black magic paraphernalia, andanother of the ousted dictator's quarters was decorated withportraits of Adolf Hitler, American servicemen told reportersThursday.   There was no word on the whereabouts of most of the members ofNoriega's general staff, although a U.S. Army source confirmed thatNoriega's brother-in-law, Lt. Col. Aquilino Sieiro, had surrendered.   The U.S. Army announced it had 1,500 prisoners of war, mostlymembers of the Panamanian Defense Forces.   Bush pledged Thursday that U.S. forces would scour Panama ``aslong as it takes'' to capture Noriega, who was indicted in theUnited States in 1988 on federal charges of trafficking inColombian cocaine and money laundering.   In a message today to Congress, Bush said: ``Although mostorganized opposition has ceased, it is not possible at this time topredict the precise scope and duration of the military operationsor how long the temporary increases of U.S. forces in Panama willbe required.''   Bush said he had sent 11,000 U.S. troops to back up the 13,000already here. U.S. officials previously said they hoped the actioncould be completed in three days.   Pentagon officials today reported 22 Americans killed, includingtwo civilian women, 202 wounded and two military men missing. Itsaid 122 Panamanians were killed and 45 wounded.   CBS news producer Jon Meyersohn, abducted by Panamanian gunmenfrom the Marriott lobby Wednesday, also was missing today.   An official in the office of Leonardo Diaz, medical director ofthe Santo Tomas Hospital, said the hospital had taken in 80 deadand more than 1,000 wounded.   ``The morgue is now full. We have no place to put the dead,''the official said, refusing to give her name.   The dead included a Spanish photographer caught in cross firebetween U.S. troops who mistook each other for Panamanian forces inthe Marriott Hotel parking lot.   Looters had a field day Thursday, sacking vendors of everythingdespite a curfew ordered by Endara, sworn in by a Panamanian judgeminutes before the invasion began at midnight Tuesday.   Endara and Arias were declared winners in presidential electionsin May, but Noriega nullified the results.</TEXT></DOC>
