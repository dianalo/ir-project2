On other markets, energy futures posted steep gains; Treasurybond futures and stock-index futures rose sharply; livestock andmeat were lower; copper plunged; and precious metals rose.   The National Weather Service's forecast for warmer- anddrier-than-normal conditions in the Midwest through mid-July wasthe main factor driving corn prices higher, analysts said.   Until this week, the dramatic rise in corn futures prices wasmainly speculative since a soaking rain could have restored almostall of the crop to full health.   But the lack of moisture has now begun taking a real toll on thecorn crop, despite scattered showers Tuesday in parts of Minnesota,Iowa and Wisconsin, said Katharina Zimmer, a wheat and corn analystwith Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.   ``Everybody knows that this is the week when we start doingdamage to the corn crops in many important growing areas,'' shesaid. ``This is the week when we really start taking off bushels.''   Contracts for delivery of corn in July, September, December andMarch all advanced their daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.   The oat and spring wheat crops have already sustained severedrought damage and experts say the soybean crop will suffer if thedry spell continues into July.   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.74 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 10 centshigher with July at $2.69{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 7\cents higher with July at $2.69\ a bushel; soybeans were unchangedto 14{ cents higher with July at $8.90 a bushel.   Oil futures surged following reports that OPEC ministers hadagreed to extend their existing oil output pact for six months, butsome analysts were at a loss to explain the market's reaction.   Futures prices had fallen sharply during the past week inanticipation of just such an agreement. Peter Beutel, an analyst inNew York with Elders Futures Inc., said he didn't know whether thejump in prices signaled a major turnaround in market sentiment orwas merely an upward blip in a downward trend.   ``I feel a little like a detective who knows there's a dead bodyhere and who's looking for a murder weapon and a motive,'' he said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 42 centshigher with July at $16.83 cents a barrel; heating oil was .55 centto .59 cent higher with July at 44.32 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .88 cent to 1.13 cents higher with July at 49.53 centsa gallon.   The government's report of an unexpected narrowing of the U.S.trade deficit to $9.89 billion gave Treasury bond futures a booston the Chicago Board of Trade.   The dollar's stronger showing against other major currenciesalso supported Treasury bond futures, analysts said.   June Treasury bonds settled 1 29-32 higher at 90 16-32.   Stock-index futures markets also registered optimism in the wakeof the trade-deficit report. The contract for June delivery of theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchangesettled 2.90 points higher at 274.60.   Pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange _ withfrozen pork bellies down sharply for the sixth straight day _ onslack retail demand for pork products, low cash hog prices andconcerns about abundant supplies of pork bellies in cold storage,analysts said.   Live cattle futures were mostly lower on weak cash markets. Asharper drop in feeder cattle futures prices reflected concernabout the rising cost of feed grains, said Thomas Morgan, presidentof Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.   Live cattle settled .27 cent lower to .20 cent higher with Juneat 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .65 cent to 1 cent lowerwith August at 73.27 cents a pound; hogs were 1.05 cents lower to.43 cent higher with June at 50.65 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were 1 cent to 1.88 cents lower with July at 46.47 cents apound.   Copper futures prices fell steeply on the Commodity Exchange inNew York, reflecting improved availability of the metal, analystssaid. Copper for June delivery settled 3.65 cents lower at $1.085 apound.   Gold and silver futures posted slight gains in reaction tohigher grain and energy futures prices.   Gold settled 20 cents to $1 higher with August at $454.60 a troyounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at $7.07 atroy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
