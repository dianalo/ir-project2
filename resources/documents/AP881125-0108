(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   El Nino, the warming of Pacific Oceanwaters blamed for droughts, typhoons and storms worldwide, may becaused by undersea volcanic lava flows, says a study by the U.S.Geological Survey.   The lava from rifts in the ocean floor may bring about thedramatic changes in sea temperature, air pressure, winds andcurrents that characterize the phenomenon, according to the studythe current issue of EOS, the publication of the AmericanGeophysical Union.   El Nino, from the Spanish for ``the child'' because the event wasnoticed to occur around Christmas, caused staggering economic damageon four continents in 1982-83. It occurred again in 1985-86 on alesser scale.   Herbert R. Shaw and James G. More of the Geological Survey inMenlo Park speculated that flows erupting through rifts in theearth's crust transfer much of their intense heat to ocean currentsflowing around the equator.   According to the theory, the warming of the water causes a dropin air pressure at the ocean surface that in turn weakens or evenreverses the normal east-to-west trade winds.   The overall result is a drastic alteration of normal weatherpatterns and an abrupt halt to the upwelling of cold currents thatcarry rich nutrients from the sea bottom to the surface along thecoast of South America.   Scientists have been unable to predict when the weatherdisruptions will return, but they seem to occur every three to sevenyears with varying degrees of impact and can last up to two years.   The 1982-83 El Nino wiped out fisheries in Peru and Ecuador,touched off searing drought in Australia and southern Africa andtyphoons in Tahiti and caused unusually violent rainstorms inCalifornia and abnormally wet winters in the Southeast.   Both the 1982-83 and 1985-86 occurrences did major harm tofishing off the West Coast.   The Pacific Rim is one of the most active seismic regions in theworld. Recent underwater lava flows discovered near the HawaiianIslands cover nearly 9,000 square miles.</TEXT></DOC>
