Tuesday reported a 7 percentgain in first-quarter profit compared with the previous year,although earnings would have fallen except for unusual items.   For the three-month period ended Jan. 31, Gulf andamp; Western said itsnet earnings totaled $69.2 million, or 58 cents a share, up from$64.7 million, or 54 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenuetotaled $1.35 billion, up 14 percent from $1.18 billion in theyear-earlier period.   New York-based Gulf andamp; Western's three operating segments arepublishing, consumer and commercial lending, and entertainment,including Paramount Pictures, Madison Square Garden and theatercircuits.   The company said first-quarter results included $5.1 millionstemming from an accounting change related to the recognition offinance income and a one-time gain of $5.6 million from the sale ofa 50 percent interest in the company's domestic theater operations.   The accounting change related to finance income should continueto add about $5 million a quarter to earnings over the next two tothree years, the company said. Without that gain and the gain on thesale, earnings would have dropped.   Gulf andamp; Western said total receivables in its consumer-commercialfinance unit exceeded $13 billion for the first time, led by healthyadvances in consumer real estate lending.   Motion picture operating income was strong but televisionoperations posted the largest percentage gains due in part to thepopularity of ``Webster'' and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,''Gulf andamp; Western said.   However, the company's Simon andamp; Schuster publishing unit recordeda loss in consumer operations despite strong sales of some hardcoverbestsellers. The losses reflected higher product support expenses,the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
