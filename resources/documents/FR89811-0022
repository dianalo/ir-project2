The proposed amendments would facilitatethe acquisition by registered investment companies and companies controlledby them of the equity securities of foreign securities firms. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary </ITAG>Section 12(d)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(3)) makes it unlawful``for any registered investment company and any company or companies controlledby such registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquireany security issued by or any other interest in the business of any personwho is a broker, a dealer, is engaged in the business of underwriting,or is either an investment adviser of an investment company or an investmentadviser registered under [the Investment Advisers Act of 1940] (15 U.S.C.80b-1 <T3>et seq.</T3>) * * *.'' \1\<NOTE/> Rule 12d3-1 under the Act, however, permits a registeredinvestment company, or any company or companies controlled by such registeredinvestment company (``acquiring company''), to acquire any security issuedby any person that, in its most recent fiscal year, derived more than 15percent of its gross revenues from securities-related activities,\2\<NOTE/> provided certain quantitative and qualitative conditionsare satisfied.\3\<NOTE/> Of particular relevance here is the condition that, at thetime of acquisition, any equity security acquired must be a ``margin security,''as defined in Regulation T (12 CFR 220.1 et seq.) (``Regulation T'') promulgatedby the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ``Board'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These prohibitions do not apply where ``(A) such personis a corporation all the outstanding securities of which (other than short-termpaper, securities representing bank loans, and directors' qualifying shares)are, or after such acquisition will be, owned by one or more registeredinvestment companies; and (B) such person is primarily engaged in the businessof underwriting and distributing securities issued by other persons, sellingsecurities to customers, or any one or more of such or related activities,and the gross income of such person normally is derived principally fromsuch business or related activities.'' Section 12(d)(3)(A), (B). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Rule 12d3-1(d)(1) defines ``securities-related activities''as ``a person's activities as a broker, as a dealer, from the businessof underwriting, as an investment adviser registered under the InvestmentAdvisers Act of 1940, as amended, or as an investment adviser to a registeredinvestment company.'' Section 12(d)(3) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibitsan acquiring company from acquiring any security issued by or any otherinterest in ``an investment adviser of an investment company.'' Proposedamended rule 12d3-1 would track the language in section 12(d)(3) by omittingthe word ``registered'' from the phrase ``investment adviser to a registeredinvestment company'' in the current definition of ``securities-relatedactivities'' as well as in the definition of ``securities-related business.''Absent this change, acquiring companies cannot rely on rule 12d3-1 to acquireinterests in a company that serves as an investment adviser to an investmentcompany, foreign or domestic, that is not registered with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Rule 12d3-1(a) also provides that for purposes of section12(d)(3) of the Act, an acquiring company may acquire without limitationany security of any issuer that, in its most recent fiscal year, derived15% or less of its gross revenues from securities-related activities, unlessthe acquiring company would control such person after the acquisition.<T3>See </T3>text accompanying note 15, <T3>infra. </T3>Several applicants for exemption from section 12(d)(3) have argued thatthe margin security requirement prevented them from acquiring the equitysecurities of foreign securities firms, because an equity security musthave a public market in the United States to meet that requirement.\4\<NOTE/> The Commission typically has granted the requested exemptions,subject to the acquired securities meeting criteria comparable to thoseset out in the Board's margin security definition. The proposed amendmentswould codify many of the standards in those orders. The standards are basedparticularly on the policies that underlie the requirements for inclusionon the list of over-the-counter margin stocks (``OTC margin stocks'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See infra </T3>notes 24-26. In a letter to the Division of InvestmentManagement, the Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') requested that rule22d3-1 be amended to permit an investment company to purchase the equitysecurities of foreign securities firms without first obtaining an exemptiveorder. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Susan P. Hart to Kathryn B. McGrath, Director,Division of Investment Management, dated April 29, 1987.One set of such requirements concerns the liquidity of the acquired security.These requirements address characteristics of both the market in whichthe security is traded and of the security itself. Concerning the market,the equity security of the foreign securities firm would have to be listedon a ``qualified foreign exchange'' meeting certain requirements as tostructure, size and stability. For example, to assure a depth of marketcomparable to that of United States national securities exchanges, thequalified foreign exchange would be required to have had an annual tradingvolume in stocks totalling at least 7.5 billion United States dollars inthe year preceding the acquisition.\5\<NOTE/> Concerning the security itself, the proposed amendments alsowould impose conditions related to the security's marketability, requiringthat the equity security have been listed on a qualified foreign exchangefor at least six months prior to the acquisition.\6\<NOTE/> Finally, the issuer of the equity security to be acquiredwould be required to have made public all information that it is requiredto make public in its home country and to have filed with any stock exchangeon which its securities are traded the filings required by that exchange.\7\<NOTE/> Other conditions of the proposed amended rule are set outin the proposed rule text.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of the proposed amended rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the proposed amended rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(C) of the proposed amended rule. <T3>Cf. </T3>rule 12g3-2(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq.</T3>) (``Exchange Act'') (which exempts securities of any foreignprivate issuer from section 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781(g)),conditioned on the furnishing of such publicly disseminated informationand other data to the Commission).  The proposed amended rule would have only prospective effect. Thus, recipientsof nonconforming prior orders would continue to be permitted to acquireforeign securities firm equity securities in accordance with those orders,notwithstanding the adoption of the proposed amended rule. The Commissionhas not proposed to supersede these orders, although it invites commenton this issue, because it believes flexibility is appropriate in this evolvinginternational area. Upon the adoption of the proposed amended rule, anyacquisition that falls outside the scope of those orders would have tobe made either in accordance with the standards of the proposed amendedrule, or pursuant to another exemptive order where alternative conditionsare substituted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Section 12(d)(3) of the Act states that it shall be unlawful ``for anyregistered investment company and any company or companies controlled bysuch registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire anysecurity issued by or any other interest in the business of any personwho is a broker, a dealer, is engaged in the business of underwriting,or is either an investment adviser of an investment company or an investmentadviser registered under [the Investment Advisers Act of 1940] * * *.''\8\<NOTE/> The section was intended to prevent investment company assetsfrom being subjected to the entrepreneurial risks associated with securities-relatedbusinesses, particularly because, at the time the section was enacted,many such businesses were organized as private partnerships.\9\<NOTE/> A partnership interest could subject the investment companyto the liabilities of the entire partnership and, moreover, could be difficultto sell. Prevention of this risk, however, was not the only purpose ofthe section.\10\<NOTE/> The section also was designed to (1) prevent investment companiesfrom being controlled by brokers, dealers, underwriters, or investmentadvisers, and (2) restrict certain reciprocal practices between investmentcompanies and brokers, dealers, underwriters or investment advisers.\11\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ These prohibitions do not apply to certain acquisitionsas discussed at note I, <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In the Senate hearings on the Act, David Schenker, theCommission's counsel for the Investment Trust Study, stated: ``Section12(c)(2) [which ultimately became section 12(d)(3)] merely states thatan investment company cannot buy an interest in a brokerage firm, a distributingcompany, or an investment banking house * * *. You can see the reason forthat. They may not want to subject all the assets of the investment trustto the risks of the underwriting business. So we see no difficulty if theyavail themselves of the corporate fiction and limit their liabilities tothe amount of money they want to invest. . . .'' Investment Trusts andInvestment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580 before a Subcomm. of the Comm.on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 243 (1940). <T3>See </T3>generally Investment Company Act Rel. No. 13725 (Jan. 17,1984) (49 FR 2912, Jan. 24, 1984) (hereinafter ``Release l3725'') (Release13725 proposed amendments to rule 12d-1 to permit investment companiesto acquire securities of issuers substantially engaged in securities-relatedactivities.).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ As the Commission stated in Release 13725, <T3>supra </T3>note 9, if prevention of this risk were the only purposeof section 12(d)(3), investment companies could have been allowed to purchasethe stock of any securities firm, provided it was a corporation, and therebymaintain limited liability. However, as discussed in <T3>supra </T3>note 1, the section permits such purchases only if the entity(a) is a corporation all the outstanding securities of which (other thanshort-term paper, securities representing bank loans, and directors' qualifyingshares) are, or after such acquisition will be, owned by one or more registeredinvestment companies; and (b) is primarily engaged in the business of underwritingand distributing securities issued by other persons, selling securitiesto customers, or any one or more of such or related activities, and thegross income of such entity normally is derived principally from such businessor related activities. Thus, section 12(d)(3) makes sense only if it alsoseeks to prevent potential conflicts of interest between the investmentcompany and the securities firm. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ For example, the section 12(d)(3) prohibition seeks toprevent an investment company from investing in a broker-dealer to rewardthe broker-dealer for selling the company's shares, rather than investingbased solely on merit. <T3>See </T3> Release 13725, <T3>supra </T3>note 9. As the Commission stated, ``placing a floor on thequality of securities that an investment company may acquire under therule may lessen any harm from certain reciprocal practices in which aninvestment company and a broker-dealer could engage.'' Investment CompanyAct Rel. No. 14036 (July 13, 1984) (49 FR 29362, July 20, 1984) (finalrule revision) (hereinafter ``Release 14036'') at n.4. Section 12(d)(3) prevented investment companies from participating in somedesirable investment opportunities that did not implicate the policiesbehind the section. This observation led to the adoption in 1964 of formerrule 12d-1,\12\<NOTE/> which allowed investment companies to acquire the securitiesof companies engaged to a limited degree in securities-related activities,but which companies were primarily and predominantly engaged in other businesses.\13\<NOTE/> In 1984, citing ``dramatic changes in the securities industrysince 1940,'' the Commission further altered the section 12(d)(3) restrictionsby replacing rule 12d-1 with rule 12d3-1.\14\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Rule 12d-1 was redesignated as rule 12d3-1 in 1984. <T3>See </T3>Release 14036, <T3>supra </T3>note 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 4044 (Sept. 4, 1964)(29 FR 12915, Sept. 15, 1964). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ In the release proposing adoption of rule 12d3-1 (Release13725), the Commission noted that ``an increasing number of securities-relatedbusinesses have incorporated, enabling investors in those businesses tolimit their liability to the amount of their original investment.'' Release13725, <T3>supra </T3>note 9. In that release, the Commission also observed thatan increasing number of non-securities businesses had become involved insecurities-related activities through mergers with or acquisitions of securities-relatedbusinesses.   Unlike rule 12d-1, rule 12d3-1 allows a registered investment company,or any company or companies controlled by such company, to purchase securitiesof issuers substantially engaged in securities-related activities. Rule12d3-1 distinguishes between issuers that derive 15% or less of their grossrevenues from securities-related activities and those issuers that derivemore than 15% of their gross revenues from securities-related activities.Under the rule, the limitations of section 12(d)(3) are not deemed to applyto any security of any issuer that, in its most recent fiscal year, derived15% or less of its gross revenues from securities-related activities, unlessthe investment company would control the issuer after the acquisition.\15\<NOTE/> In addition, an investment company may acquire any securityof any issuer that, in its most recent fiscal year, derived more than 15%of its gross revenues from securities-related activities if certain quantitativeand qualitative conditions are met.\16\<NOTE/> The qualitative conditions require that: (1) an equity securitybe a ``margin security'' as defined in Regulation T, and (2) a debt securitybe classified as ``investment grade'' by the acquiring company's boardof directors.\17\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See </T3>rule 12d3-1(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See </T3>rule 12d3-1(b). For a full discussion of the quantitativeconditions of rule 12d3-1, consult Release 14036, <T3>supra </T3>note 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See </T3>Release 14036, <T3>supra </T3>note 11. In Release 14036, the Commission stated that thequalitative conditions of the rule promote two objectives: (a) That thesecurities acquired by an investment company be liquid, and (b) that oflessening the effect of any reciprocal practices between an investmentcompany and a broker-dealer. It is also instructive to study the Board'sdefinition of margin security, because that concept is incorporated intorule 12d3-1. Liquidity is a paramount concern embodied in the Board's definitionof margin security. For example, the Board amended the definition of ``marginsecurity'' in 1984 to include securities designated as being National MarketSystem securities by the National Association of Securities Dealers. FederalReserve System Docket No. 0512 (Sept. 5, 1984) (49 FR 35756, Sept. 22,1984) (final rule). The Board adopted that amendment based on the conclusionof its staff that ``liquidity and other factors [of the NMS securities]compare favorably with securities traded on major exchanges''. FederalReserve System Docket No. 0512 (Mar. 7, 1984) (49 FR 9741, Mar 15, 1984)(proposed amendments).There are several ways that an equity security can meet the definitionof ``margin security'' under Regulation T. Margin security is defined asany (1) security registered or admitted to unlisted trading privilegeson a national securities exchange, (2) OTC margin stock,\18\<NOTE/> (3) OTC margin bond, (4) OTC security designated as qualifiedfor trading in the National Market System under a designation plan approvedby the Commission (``NMS security''), or (5) security issued by eitheran open-end investment company or unit investment trust that is registeredunder section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8).\19\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ OTC margin stock is defined as any equity security nottraded on a national securities exchange that the Board has determinedhas the degree of national investor interest, the depth and breadth ofmarket, the availability of information respecting the security and itsissuer, and the character and permanence of the issuer to warrant beingtreated like an equity security traded on a national securities exchange.12 CFR 220.2(s) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 220.2 (o) and (v) (1988). A security issued by a foreign securities firm may qualify as a marginsecurity if it is listed or has unlisted trading privileges on a nationalsecurities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the ExchangeAct (15 U.S.C. 78f).\20\<NOTE/> To have its securities listed on a national securities exchange,a foreign securities firm would have to register its securities under section12 of the Exchange Act, which, among other things, would require the companyto make a variety of disclosures in its application to the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 15 U.S.C. 78f. The American Stock Exchange and the NewYork Stock Exchange, for example, are each registered as national securitiesexchanges under section 6 of the Exchange Act. The American Stock Exchangeand New York Stock Exchange each allow the securities of foreign companiesto be listed with them. <T3>See </T3>American Stock Exchange Company Guide, section 110; New YorkStock Exchange Listed Company Manual, section 103.  Foreign securities also may be deemed margin securities by being includedin the list of OTC margin stocks. In 1982, the Board amended the criteriafor inclusion on the list of OTC margin stocks to allow the equity securitiesof foreign issuers to be eligible.\21\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Federal Reserve System Docket No. 0372 (May 12, 1982)(47 FR 21756, May 20, 1982). As the Board stated in the adopting release:<ITAG tagnum="28">Foreign issuers were precluded from OTC List eligibility in the pastbecause of the relative lack of access to such issuers' financial information.The strengthened disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commissionnow make it possible to obtain comprehensive and up to date financial informationon many foreign issuers. Because of these improvements, it is no longernecessary to restrict OTC List candidates to domestic issuers. Foreignas well as domestic issuers must, however, be registered or filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission in order to be eligible for inclusionon the OTC List. </ITAG>Rule 12d3-1, therefore, permits acquisitions by registered investment companiesof the equity securities of only those foreign securities firms that meetthe margin security definition, or that derive 15% or less of their grossrevenues from securities-related activities. In the release adopting rule 12d3-1, the Commission predicted that investmentin foreign companies engaged in securities-related activities would notbe limited significantly by the rule, because for many such investments,investment companies would be able to rely on the blanket exemption (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the exemption applicable to an issuer deriving 15% or lessof its gross revenues from securities-related activities), or on the exemptionprovided for debt securities issued by securities-related businesses.\22\<NOTE/> However, investment companies now have considerable interestin acquiring equity interests in foreign securities firms that are notcovered by the existing exemptive rule.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ See Release 14036, <T3>supra </T3>note 11. The Commission observed that an investment companywould still be able to acquire debt securities of foreign securities firmsunder rule 12d3-1, because such acquisitions are conditioned on the company'sboard of directors classifying the debt securities as investment grade.The proposed amendments would retain that condition, and thus would notaffect acquisitions of foreign securities firm debt securities.  Since the adoption of rule 12d3-1,\23\<NOTE/> the Commission has    received several applications for exemptionfrom section 12(d)(3) to allow registered investment companies to acquirethe equity securities of foreign securities firms. To date, the Divisionof Investment Management (``Division''), by delegated authority, has authorizedacquisitions of the equity securities of certain Japanese securities firms,\24\<NOTE/> certain European banks engaged in securities-related activities,\25\<NOTE/> and certain foreign securities firms listed on specifiedforeign stock exchanges.\26\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Subsequent to Release 14036, <T3>supra </T3>note 11, the Commission amended rule 12d3-1 to permit moneymarket funds to purchase put options from persons engaged in securities-relatedbusinesses.

Specifically, the applicants represented that each of theJapanese securities firms was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (FirstSection), the listing requirements for which were comparable, in termsof share distribution, total market value and earning power, to those imposedby the (i) New York and American Stock Exchanges, (ii) National Associationof  Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to become eligible for listing on theNASD automated quotation system (``NASDAQ''), and (iii) Board for inclusionon the OTC margin security list. In addition, shares of the Japanese securitiesfirms were traded on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, which, at thetime of the application, respectively ranked second and third worldwidein terms of total market value of equity shares listed, according to anapplicant. Also significant was the fact that all Japanese companies withpublicly issued securities are required to file with the Japanese Ministerof Finance (``Minister'') annual reports (which are publicly available)containing information relating to the company's objectives, stated capital,securities issued and financial position, the nature and state of its businessoperations, and such other information as the Minister may request. Amendedreports must be filed with the Minister upon the occurrence of any materialchange of information. The applicants further represented that the financialstatements contained in annual reports must be certified by a certifiedpublic accountant or an incorporated accounting firm which has no specialinterest in the reporting corporation. Finally, the applicants representedthat the Japanese securities firms were required to publish their annualreports in English.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See </T3>orders cited in note 24, <T3>supra.</T3> The applicants in The Helvetia Fund and Germany Fund orders,\28\<NOTE/> also agreed to satisfy all the conditions of rule  12d3-1,except the ``margin security'' requirement.

In each case, the applicantrepresented that the securities it sought to acquire, although listed onlyon foreign stock exchanges, would be eligible for listing on one or moreof the following: The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchangeor NASDAQ. Each applicant represented that the disclosure requirementsapplicable to the banks were the substantial equivalent of the disclosuresrequired by the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq.</T3>) (``Securities Act''). The applicants also representedthat the banks were subject to various ongoing disclosure requirements.For example, the banks in the Germany Fund order are required by Germanlaw to publish annual reports disclosing, among other things, all materialfacts and events occurring since the prior annual report. The applicantalso represented that all of the German banks governed by the order publishtheir annual reports in English.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 25. Finally, in Daily Money Fund,\29\<NOTE/> the applicants were permitted to acquire equity and convertibledebt securities that met certain quality standards and were listed on certain ``qualified foreign exchanges''.\30\<NOTE/> These conditions were, to a large extent, patterned afterthe requirements for inclusion on the list of OTC margin stocks, and havebeen incorporated in subsequent exemptive orders under rule 12d3-1.\31\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 26.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ The exchanges deemed to be qualified under the conditionsof that order are those exchanges listed in note 26, <T3>supra</T3>, subject to the condition that they continue to meet thefollowing minimum criteria: (1) The exchange has listed equity shares witha market value of at least 25 billion United States dollars, (2) the equityshares of at least 150 companies are listed on the exchange, (3) the exchangehas had an average daily trading volume over the preceding six month periodof at least 25 million United States dollars, and (4) the exchange hashad, in the previous year, a minimum turnover ratio of at least 20% ofits total market capitalization. As discussed, Daily Money Fund and Prudential-BacheGlobal Fund, <T3>supra </T3>note 26, which had these foreign exchange conditions, eachset out fixed criteria to describe what constitutes a qualified foreignexchange. Accordingly, recipients of those orders may acquire foreign securitiesfirm equity securities traded on a foreign stock exchange only so longas that exchange continues to meet the fixed criteria. The proposed amendedrule would impose fixed conditions as to the foreign stock exchange onwhich the equity security is traded, and thus would function similarly.The Daily Money Fund order also is conditioned on the acquired securitiesthemselves meeting the following standards: (1) Daily quotations for bothbid and asked prices for the stock are continuously available to the generalpublic, (2) the stock has been publicly traded for at least six months,(3) the issuer or a predecessor in interest has been in existence for atleast three years, (4) the issuer has at least 10 million United Statesdollars of capital, surplus and undivided profits, (5) the issuer is requiredby exchange or governmental regulation to file publicly (i) reports ofany important financial or structural corporate changes, (ii) semi-annualprofit and loss statements, and (iii) annual reports of independently auditedassets and liabilities, profits and losses, and changes in financial position,(6) the issuer must have a minimum market capitalization of 20 millionUnited States dollars, and (7) the stock must have (i) an average dailytrading volume of at least 500 shares and (ii) an average daily tradingvolume totaling at least 25,000 United States dollars. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See </T3>Prudential-Bache Global Fund, Inc., <T3>supra </T3>note 26. <T3>See also </T3>The Thai Fund, Inc., Investment Company Act Rel.

Investment companies have participatedactively in this internationalization process.\32\<NOTE/> Indeed, a significant part of    the recent increase in UnitedStates investments in foreign markets is attributable to a surge in investmentsby domestic mutual funds and closed-end investment companies in foreignsecurities.\33\<NOTE/> The equity securities of companies that are securities firms,or that fall within the definition of ``securities firm,'' often figureprominently in the equity markets of a particular foreign country.\34\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See</T3> Report of the Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto the Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the HouseComm. on Energy and Commerce, Internationalization of the Securities Markets(July 27, 1987) (hereinafter ``Internationalization Report'') at II-2,VI-1. The Internationalization Report noted that since 1983, the numberof domestic open-end investment companies that concentrated their portfolioinvestments in foreign securities had nearly tripled, and the total assetsof those companies had grown from $3.5 billion to over $14 billion. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See</T3> Internationalization Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 32, at II-78. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>E.g.,</T3> Germany Fund, <T3>supra</T3> note 25, in which the applicant represented that the Germanbanks in which it proposed to invest represented 9.13% of the FrankfurterAlldemgemeine Zeitung Index (which is composed of a broadly representativelist of major industrial, mining, financial and utility stocks).  Several recent Commission proposals have responded to the desire of investorsto trade in financial markets around the world.\35\<NOTE/> Complementing such efforts are the proposals of some foreigncountries to open their securities markets to investors.\36\<NOTE/> Through the proposed amendments to rule 12d3-1, the Commissionwould be using its exemptive power under section 6(c) of the Act (15 U.S.C.80a-6(c)) to assist in these efforts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3>E.g.,</T3> Rel.

The ceiling on foreign investment in local securities firmsalso may be raised. <T3>See</T3> Korea Sets Timetable for Financial Markets Reform, FinancialTimes, Nov. 14, 1988, at 27.  Section 6(c) provides that the Commission, by rules and regulations uponits own motion, may, among other things, conditionally or unconditionallyexempt any person or any class or classes of persons, from any provisionof the Act, ``if and to the extent that such exception is necessary orappropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection ofinvestors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions''of the Act. The exemption that would be provided by the proposed amendmentsto rule 12d3-1, if adopted, would be appropriate in the public interestby responding to the developments discussed above and by increasing therange of investment opportunities available to acquiring companies. Asdiscussed more fully below, the Commission also believes the proposed amendedrule would be consistent with the protection of investors and the purposesfairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act because the conditionsof the proposed amendments provide standards comparable to those providedby current rule 12d3-1. The Commission believes now, as it did when it adopted rule 12d3-1, thatthe quality standards applicable to the equity securities of foreign securitiesfirms should be comparable to those applicable to the equity securitiesof domestic issuers.\37\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission proposes amendments to rule 12d3-1that would allow acquiring companies to purchase the equity securities\38\<NOTE/> of foreign securities firms,\39\<NOTE/> provided such securities meet certain conditions as to liquidityand other factors. The proposed amendments are designed to permit the acquisitionof the equity securities of foreign securities firms that do not meet thedefinition of margin security. Thus, acquisitions of foreign securitiesfirm equity securities that do meet the definition of margin security wouldbe unaffected by the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See</T3> Release 14036, <T3>supra</T3> note 11 at 4B. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ As in current rule 12d3-1, the proposed amended rulewould define ``equity security'' in accordance with rule 3a11-1 under theExchange Act (17 CFR 240.3a11-1 (1988)). Rule 3a11-1 defines equity securityto include, among other things, any security convertible into an equitysecurity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ The proposed amended rule would not separately define``foreign securities firm,'' since such entities would be embraced by existingdefinitions in the rule, which refer to ``persons'' engaged in ``securities-relatedactivities.'' Section 2(a)(28) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(28)) defines``person'' as ``a natural person or a company.'' Consistent with the existing rule, the various determinations requiredof investment companies concerning whether a foreign securities firm equitysecurity meets the proposed amended rule's standards for acquisition needonly be made at the time of acquisition. An acquiring company thereforeneed not divest itself of a security of a foreign securities firm if, subsequentto its acquisition, any particular condition is no longer met. In keeping with the objectives of the rule, the proposed standards relatingto the equity securities of foreign securities firms are comparable (andin certain instances identical) to the requirements for inclusion of securitieson the list of OTC margin stocks.\40\<NOTE/> Like the margin stock requirements, the requirements of theproposed amendments focus on the characteristics of the market in whichthe security is traded and on the characteristics of the security itself.Adequate disclosure to investors is another objective promoted by the proposedamendments.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Regulation T states that OTC margin stock shall meetthe following requirements: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Four or more dealers stand willing to, and do in fact, make amarket in such stock and regularly submit bona fide bids and offers toan automated quotations system for their own accounts; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) The minimum average bid price of such stock, as determined bythe Board, is at least $5 per share; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) The stock is registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act,is issued by an insurance company subject to section 12(g)(2)(G) of theExchange Act, is issued by a closed-end investment management company subjectto registration pursuant to section 8 of the Act, is an American DepositoryReceipt (ADR) of a foreign issuer whose securities are registered undersection 12 of the Exchange Act, or is a stock of an issuer required tofile reports under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) Daily quotations for both bid and asked prices for the stock arecontinuously available to the general public; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(5) The stock has been publicly traded for at least six months; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(6) The issuer has at least $4 million of capital, surplus, and undividedprofits; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(7) There are 400,000 or more shares of such stock outstanding inaddition to shares held beneficially by officers, directors or beneficialowners of more than 10 percent of the stock; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(8) There are 1,200 or more holders of record, as defined in Rule12g5-1 (17 CFR 240.12g5 1) of the stock who are not officers, directorsor beneficial owners of 10 percent or more of the stock, or the averagedaily trading volume of such stock as determined by the Board is at least500 shares; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(9) The issuer or a predecessor in interest has been in existencefor at least three years.</ITAG>Two of the requirements for inclusion on the list of OTC margin stocksrelate to the market for the security.\41\<NOTE/> One requirement is that daily quotations for both bid andasked prices for the stock be continuously available to the general public.This requirement relates to liquidity,\42\<NOTE/> and is included without modification in the proposed amendments.The other OTC margin requirement is that four or more dealers stand willingto make, and do in fact make, a market in the stock and regularly submitbona fide bids and offers to an automated quotations systems for theirown accounts. Because this requirement is appropriate to an over-the-counterstock market, but not to a stock exchange, the proposed amendments requireinstead that the security to be acquired be listed on a foreign stock exchangethat meets specified standards. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ 12 CFR 220.17 (a)(1) and (a)(4) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Registered investment companies issuing redeemable securitiesare required under rule 22c-1 of the Act (17 CFR 270.22c-1 (1988)) to computecurrent net asset value no less frequently than once daily. The requirementof the proposed amended rule would therefore allow such an investment companyto make this computation as to foreign securities firm stocks in its portfolio.Under the proposed amendments, an acquiring company could acquire an equitysecurity of a foreign securities firm only if that security were listedon at least one foreign stock exchange meeting the following characteristics(``qualified foreign exchange''): (a) Trading on the exchange occurs atleast four days per seven-day week (except when the exchange is closedfor national holidays),\43\<NOTE/> (b) neither exchange rules nor foreign governmental regulationsrestrict the ability of an acquiring company to trade its holdings on theexchange (unless such restrictions apply equally to all persons),\44\<NOTE/> (c) the exchange has had an annual trading volume in stocksover the preceding year totalling at least 7.5 billion United States dollars,\45\<NOTE/> and (d) the exchange has had, in the preceding year, a turnoverratio of at least 20% of its total market capitalization.\46\<NOTE/> As discussed in notes 45 and 46, the criteria regarding turnoverratio and trading volume are derived from figures representative of nationalsecurities exchanges in the United States.\47\<NOTE/> The Commission seeks comment on alternative formulationsof the trading volume and turnover ratio criteria.\48\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ This condition is designed to provide the acquiring companywith ample opportunity to trade its holdings of the foreign securitiesfirm's equity securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ This condition is designed to ensure that the acquiringcompany may trade without restriction in the foreign stock market. <T3>Cf. </T3>The Thai Fund, Inc. (pub. avail. Oct. 29, 1987), in whichthe applicant represented that because non-Thai nationals may purchaseThai securities under only very limited circumstances, it was necessaryto create a Thai entity through which the fund could purchase Thai securities.Through this entity, the fund was able to trade freely. The Division'sno-action position would not be affected by the proposal or adoption ofamended rule 12d3-1. Moreover, the Commission may grant an exemptive orderto an applicant that does not meet this proposed condition, provided comparablesafeguards are present. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Trading volume is indicative of the level of activityin the market. Qualified foreign exchanges should be comparable to UnitedStates national stock exchanges with respect to this criterion. The annualtrading volume figure (7.5 billion United States dollars) approximatesthe market value of stocks sold on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange during1988, as well as the trading volume figure of Daily Money Fund (<T3>i.e., </T3>25 million United States dollars daily, which equates to7.5 billion United States dollars annually), <T3>supra </T3>note 26. <T3>See </T3>SEC Monthly Statistical Review, Vol. 48, No. 2. Measurementof share volume in United States dollars rather than in number of sharesis consistent with the reporting practices of Federation Internationaledes Bourses de Valeurs. Any trading volume figure adopted would be reviewedperiodically by the Commission to assure that it continues to be sufficientor relevant as a standard. <ITAG tagnum="28">Whenever a currency conversion to United States dollars would be requiredto determine compliance with a condition of the proposed amended rule,the exchange rate in existence at the time of acquisition must be used.</ITAG><T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(11) of the proposed amended rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Turnover ratio for a stock exchange is obtained by dividingthe annual share volume by the average number of shares listed during thatyear. It provides a general indication of the frequency with which shareslisted on an exchange are traded. The turnover ratio appearing in the proposedrule amendments is the same as that in Daily Money Fund, <T3>supra </T3>note 26, and also approximates the turnover ratio for theAmerican Stock Exchange for 1988 (<T3>i.e., </T3>28.8%). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Under the ICI proposal to amend rule 12d3-1 (<T3>see supra </T3>note 4), the acquisition of the equity security of aforeign securities firm would be conditioned only on the security beinglisted on a ``principal national securities exchange.'' The Commissionbelieves, however, that it is preferable for the proposed amendments tocontain specific requirements as to the foreign stock exchange on whichthe foreign securities firm equity security is traded. These requirementswould provide a more objective standard as a basis for the amended rule'savailability. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ There are other aspects of the foreign market (such asthe time it takes to settle transactions) that may affect liquidity butare not incorporated into the proposed amended rule. Comment is soughton whether other factors should be made a part of the proposed amendedrule, and what those factors are. The Commission also seeks comment onwhether a turnover criterion for the equity security itself would be anappropriate substitute for the proposed exchange turnover criterion.The remaining margin stock requirements focus on the security and its issuer.The proposed rule would incorporate several of these criteria, with modifications.The proposed rule would require that (1) the equity security of the foreignsecurities firm have been publicly traded for at least six months priorto being acquired, (2) the average daily trading volume of such equitysecurity over the six months preceding the acquisition be at least 500shares,\49\<NOTE/> (3) there be 400,000 or more shares of such stock outstanding,not counting shares held beneficially by officers, directors, or beneficialowners of more than ten percent of the equity security,\50\<NOTE/> (4) the foreign securities firm have capital, surplus andundivided profits (or their equivalent) collectively totalling at least4 million United States dollars,\51\<NOTE/> and (5) the foreign securities firm have been in existencefor at least three years prior to the acquisition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ This condition is taken from the margin stock requirementthat there be either 1,200 or more holders of record who are not officers,directors or beneficial owners of 10 percent or more of the stock <T3>or </T3>the average daily trading volume of the stock as determinedby the Board be at least 500 shares. In many foreign countries, it maybe problematic to ascertain the number of shareholders because such informationneed not be made public. <T3>See </T3>Internationalization Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 32, at III-84 (noting that under European EconomicCommunity Council Directive, ``disclosure of shareholder interests belowan established threshold need not be made, and this threshold may be setby member states at as high as 20 percent of the equity''). Accordingly,the proposed rule amendments would require an average daily trading volumeof at least 500 shares, which the Commission believes should be ascertainable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ The 400,000 share requirement also was taken from themargin stock requirements. Apart from the exclusion of holders of morethan 10% of the equity securities, this requirement focuses on the numberof shares outstanding, rather than the number of holders of the stock,and hence should be ascertainable in most instances. However, comment issought specifically on the feasibility of this criterion. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ This condition is a modification of a margin stock requirement,changed to reflect the fact that the terms capital, surplus and undividedprofits may be defined differently in foreign countries than in the UnitedStates. <T3>See </T3>Internationalization Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 32, at IV-8, IV-13. Accordingly, a registered investmentcompany may acquire securities of a foreign securities firm under the proposedrule if it determines that the firm has assets equivalent to $4 millionof capital, surplus and undivided profits as those terms are defined undergenerally accepted accounting principles.  The margin stock requirements also provide that the minimum average bidprice of the stock shall be at least $5 per share, a characteristic thatdemonstrates some level of character and permanence on the part of theissuer.\52\<NOTE/> However, some foreign securities firms possessing characterand permanence comparable to that of United States companies meeting the$5 per share standard may have shares that trade well below the equivalentof $5 per share.\53\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission proposes an alternative standard.\54\<NOTE/> The margin stock requirements contemplate an average dailytrading volume for the stock of at least 500 shares and a minimum averagebid price of at least $5 per share, which amounts to an average daily tradingvolume valued at a minimum of $2,500. The proposed amendments would requirethe trading volume in the foreign equity security measured in dollar termsto exceed a specified level. The figures disclosed in exemptive applicationsindicate that this level may be substantially higher than $2,500 and accordingly,the proposed amended rule would require an average daily trading volumeequal in value to at least $25,000.\55\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ The character and permanence of the issuer are factorsconsidered by the Board in determining whether to classify the issuer'sstock as ``OTC margin stock.'' <T3>See supra </T3>note 18. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See </T3>Daily Money Fund, <T3>supra </T3>note 26. <T3>See also </T3>application of Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund, Inc.

A number of the applicants for exemption from the marginsecurity requirement of rule 12d3-1 indicated that it would be appropriatenot to hold foreign securities firms to the $5 per share standard. Accordingly,the proposed amended rule posits an alternative standard. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ This figure was proposed by the applicants in Daily MoneyFund, <T3>supra </T3>note 26, and incorporated into the order. <T3>See also </T3>Prudential-Bache Global Fund, Inc., <T3>supra </T3>note 26, (in which the same condition was proposed by theapplicant and incorporated into the order). Comment is sought specificallyon the suitability of this criterion.The remaining margin stock requirement \56\<NOTE/> is keyed primarily to security registration under section12 of the Exchange Act, and thereby requires certain disclosures to theinvesting public. In keeping with the basic purpose of that margin stockrequirement, a foreign securities firm would be required to have made publicall information that it is required to make public in its home countryand to have filed with any stock exchange on which its securities are tradedthe filings required by that exchange.\57\<NOTE/> Specifically, the foreign securities firm would be required(A) to have made publicly available all information that it was requiredto make public since the beginning of its last fiscal year pursuant tothe law of the country of its domicile or in which it is incorporated ororganized, and (B) to have made all filings required since the beginningof its last fiscal year by any stock exchange on which its securities aretraded.\58\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that public availability of thisinformation will protect acquiring companies and their shareholders. Commentis sought on the appropriateness of the disclosures contemplated by theproposed amended rule.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ The stock must be registered under section 12 of theExchange Act, issued by an insurance company subject to section 12(g)(2)(G)of the Exchange Act, issued by a closedend investment management companysubject to registration pursuant to section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8),an American Depository Receipt (ADR) of a foreign issuer whose securitiesare registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act, or the stock of anissuer required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act(l5 U.S.C. 78o(d)). 12 CFR 220.17(a)(3) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Of course, the disclosures required under the proposedamended rule would not be a substitute for the disclosures that could berequired under other United States securities laws, such as section 5 ofthe Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ <T3>Cf.</T3> rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act (17 C.F.R. 240.12g3-2(b))(which exempts securities of any foreign private issuer from section 12(g)of the Exchange Act, conditioned on the furnishing of such informationand other data to the Commission). While proposed amended rule 12d3-1 imposes specific conditions as to anacquiring company's acquisition of the equity securities of foreign securitiesfirms, the Commission anticipates that investment advisers will continueto consider the interests of the acquiring company and its shareholdersin determining whether to acquire the equity securities of a foreign securitiesfirm. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost/Benefit of Proposed Action </ITAG>Although acquiring companies would incur some costs in making the determinationsnecessary to ensure that the conditions of the proposed amended rule arecomplied with, the proposed amendments to rule 12d3-1 would not imposeany significant additional burdens on investment companies. On the contrary,investment companies to which the rule would apply would generally filefewer applications for exemption. The proposed amendments also would provideinvestment companies and companies controlled by them with a greater rangeof foreign securities in which to invest. The Commission would benefitfrom the proposed amendments because its staff would review fewer applicationsfor exemption in this area. Comments are requested on these matters, however,and on the costs or benefits of any other aspect of the proposed amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding proposed amended rule 12d3-1.Although the proposed amended rule as presently drafted would have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities, the other significantalternatives considered by the Commission would not have achieved the rule'sobjectives, and thus were not proposed. The proposed amended rule promotesthe objectives discussed in the proposing release in a way that minimizesthe impact on small entities. The Analysis explains that proposed amendedrule 12d3-1, which would be adopted under the authority granted to theCommission in sections 6(c) and 38(a) of the Act, would facilitate theacquisition of the equity securities of foreign securities firms by smallentities and other acquiring companies. It states that the proposed amendedrule is intended to protect investors from the abuses that led to the enactmentof section 12(d)(3) of the Act, and to reduce the number of applicationsfiled with the Commission regarding the acquisition of the equity securitiesof foreign securities firms. Any company with net assets of $50 millionor less would be a small entity subject to the proposed amendments to rule12d3-1. It is estimated that out of 3,479 active investment companies registeredwith the Commission as of March 31, 1989, 1,925 of such companies wouldbe considered small entities. The Analysis indicates that the proposedamended rule contains no reporting or recordkeeping requirements and doesnot overlap, duplicate or conflict with other federal laws. To the extentthat the proposed amended rule would eliminate the need for acquiring companiesto file applications seeking orders under section 12(d)(3), it would reducecosts incurred by small entities and other acquiring companies in preparingand filing applications. The Analysis discusses the following significant alternatives to the proposed,amended rule that were considered by the Commission: (a) That acquisitionsof foreign securities firm equity securities be conditioned only on a findingby the company's board of directors that such securities are as liquidas securities meeting the margin security definition, (b) that such acquisitionsbe conditioned only on the security being listed on a principal nationalsecurities exchange, (c) that the share turnover and share volume criteriabe omitted from the proposed amended rule, and (d) that a disclosure regimedifferent from that being proposed be applied to the foreign securitiesfirms subject to the rule. The first alternative is a performance standard that would simplify thecompliance requirements of the proposed amended rule for small acquiringcompanies, in that fewer criteria would have to be considered prior toan acquisition. This reduced compliance burden, which also would be promotedby the second alternative, might have been particularly beneficial to smallinvestment companies with limited research staffs. The Commission rejectedthese approaches, however, because the specific standards of the proposedamended rule should provide better guidance to small entities and otheracquiring companies. Moreover, those approaches would not have fulfilledthe objectives of section 12(d)(3) and the rule.The Commission also declined to omit conditions as to share turnover andshare volume. Although that approach also would have simplified the compliancerequirements for small acquiring companies, those conditions of the proposedamended rule promote liquidity, which is integral to rule 12d3-1. The Commissionalso believes that the disclosure contemplated by the proposed amendedrule is consistent with the policies underlying the margin security concept.Any other disclosure requirement, although it would result in a differentcompliance requirement for small entities, would not promote those policies.Finally, because it is equally important that small acquiring companiesbe protected by the conditions of the proposed amended rule, the Commissionopted not to exempt such small entities from the coverage of the rule.A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained bycontacting C.
