<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-1103 </DOCNO><TEXT>Discusses geology and tectonics of the Upper Silesia basin and methodsfor forecasting tectonic disturbances as well as mining conditions (seaminclination and thickness, thickness fluctuations, temperature increasewith increasing mining depth). Gravimetric investigations show that gravityforce anomalies occur at depths of 3.5 km and 11.0 km. The residual anomalycaused by variations of rock density at depths to 11.0 km indicates occurrenceof numerous faults and other disturbances. In the western part of theUpper Silesia basin, these disturbances correspond with 4 fault systemsin the igneous base of the Carboniferous strata. In the eastern part,the disturbances correspond with the structures of the Cracow fold (Boleslawsyncline, Debnik, Siewierz and Cracow anticlines). Fault systems in theCarboniferous strata correspond with those in the crystalline base. Effectsof tectonics and tectonic stresses on tremor hazards, fluctuations ofcoal seam thickness and faults are discussed. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
