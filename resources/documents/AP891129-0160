Since 1986, a total of 99 eagles, falcons, hawks and owls havebeen killed at the farm's thousands of 40-foot windmills,considered one of the most environmentally safe ways to generateelectricity.   The California Energy Commission is spending $120,000 to findout why.   ``These birds may have the sharpest eyes, but they don'tnecessarily have the biggest brains,'' said Susan Orloff, a seniorwildlife biologist with Biosystems Analysis Inc., the Tiburoncompany hired to do the study.   ``At this point we really don't know why they're doing this,''Orloff said.   Altamont Pass, with 6,700 windmills sprouting like steel daisiesover 80 square miles along Interstate 580 near Livermore, is theworld's largest and most productive wind farm.   California produces more than 90 percent of the world'swind-generated electricity, and Altamont is the largest of thestate's six wind farms. Together, they produce enough power for acity the size of San Jose.   The pass is also a traditional migratory path where birds ofprey hunt for food during their flight down the state's CentralValley to winter in Mexico.   The state Energy Commission study, administered by Contra Costa,Alameda and Solano counties, is being conducted during the spring,fall and winter seasons at Altamont Pass. Five Biosystems Analysisbiologists are counting birds and studying their behavior every dayat the farm.   They speculate the birds, despite their sharp vision, may bemistaking the windmills for trees. They may also be concentratingso intently on their prey that they don't see the whirling blades,Orloff said.   Researchers are experimenting with ways to deter the birds,possibly using noise or painting the windmills a bright color.Local ordinances, however, aimed at preventing eyesores preventwindmill operators from painting the windmills.   Mike DeAngelis, manager of the state energy commission'sresearch and development office, said he doubts that any of thoseideas will work. ``If this is a problem, it's going to remain aproblem,'' he said.   U.S. Wind Power, which operates nearly half the windmills atAltamont Pass, also has hired a biologist to study ways of stoppingthe deaths, said Lori Adams, a business development associate forthe company.   ``It's really a shame that this happens, and we'd like to dowhat we can to make sure it doesn't happen at all,'' said Adams.   The company has built roosts on power line poles to keep thebirds from electrocuting themselves by sitting on lines and hasdeveloped a manual to help field workers handle accidents.   It also contributes money to a shelter in Stockton for injuredbirds of prey.</TEXT></DOC>
