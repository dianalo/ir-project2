L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552, 613-614 (1987), to providevarious types of assistance to FSLIC-insured institutions under certainconditions. Assistance may be provided directly to the institution to preventits default or to facilitate the merger/acquisition of an association byanother entity financially able to acquire the failing institution. Inorder for the FSLIC to provide assistance, either the amount of the assistancemust be less than the cost of liquidating, including paying the insuredaccounts of the institution, or the FSLIC must determine that the continuedoperation of the institution is essential to provide adequate savings orhome financing services in its community. The Board is publishing the followingStatement of Policy and Criteria to provide guidance regarding this typeof assistance under certain conditions. Statement of policy and criteria: This Statement of Policy and Criteriais issued to set out the general terms and conditions the Board believesare appropriate if the FSLIC is to provide assistance to an operating FSLIC-insuredinstitution to prevent its default or to minimize the risk to the FSLIC,absent an immediate merger/acquisition by a third party. The objectivesof providing assistance to an operating institution are as follows: A. For an institution near insolvency, where FSLIC financial assistancewill be necessary to prevent a default and the problems of the institutionhave been identified and are containable, to facilitate earlier resolutionof the problem to lessen the cost to FSLIC; and B. For an already insolvent institution, where a determination has beenmade that FSLIC assistance is necessary to resolve the case and an immediateacquisition by a third party is not feasible, to provide assistance tostabilize the institution pending a subsequent resolution action or tofacilitate the rehabilitation of the institution. The rehabilitation optionwill include appropriate ownership incentives for approved management thatwill be undertaking the recovery effort in conjunction with the FSLIC.The Board anticipates approval of assistance to insolvent institutionswill often be accompanied by consolidations in order to take advantageof economies of scale. Assistance intended for near insolvent institutions should meet the followingguidelines unless the Board determines that there are compelling reasonsjustifying the contrary: (1) The estimated cost to the FSLIC clearly must be less than other readilyavailable options. The cost analyses should reflect the future risk eachavailable case resolution option represents for the FSLIC. (2) Adequate managerial resources, sufficient projected capitalization,and a reasonable assurance of the future profitability of the institutionmust be provided for. A key determinant of sufficient projected capitalizationshould be compliance with the Board's capital regulations at a specifiedfuture date. (3) Assistance must be accompanied by significant capital infusions fromthe stockholders and/or other non-FSLIC sources. (4) Assistance must benefit the institution and the FSLIC and not be divertedto other purposes. (5) The review, renegotiation, or termination of management contracts shouldbe expected prior to the granting of assistance. Continued service of alldirectors, officers serving in a policy-making role, and other officersof the assisted institution, as may be designated by the FSLIC, will besubject to approval by the FSLIC. Further, the FSLIC will review and mustapprove any or all parts of any new compensation packages or terminationagreements covering these individuals throughout the period assistanceis outstanding. (6) Common shareholders and holders of subordinated debt and/or preferredstock of the failing institution must agree to subordinate to the interestsof the FSLIC represented by its direct financial assistance until it hasbeen repaid. Until the assistance has been repaid, no dividends or paymentson subordinated debt/preferred stock will be permitted absent FSLIC approval.FSLIC approval for dividends in advance of total repayment of assistancewould generally be limited to new capital and equity positions taken bythe FSLIC. (7) If acceptance of an equity position (such as preferred stock) is necessary,the FSLIC will receive a return on equity satisfactory to the FSLIC. TheFSLIC is not permitted to own voting or common stock of an insured institution.(8) Any direct FSLIC assistance should be repaid with interest. As additionalcompensation or repayment for the assistance and risk, the FSLIC will expectto receive warrants to purchase common stock or some other appropriateform of compensation.(9) If the assisted institution is a subsidiary of a holding company, dividends,interest payments, compensation, etc., would not be permitted to flow fromthe insured institution to the holding company without prior FSLIC approvaluntil all assistance has been repaid in full. The holding company shouldmake a significant contribution toward minimizing the financial exposureof the FSLIC.(10) The FSLIC and the Office of Regulatory Activities (``ORA''), or theirdesignee, have the right to approve/disapprove the institution's businessplans and budgets.(11) The institution would agree to accept FSLIC notes and/or other assetsof the FSLIC for the payment of assistance.(12) The institution must execute a ``pre-nuptial'' or net worth maintenanceagreement with the FSLIC consenting to a merger/acquisition or the appointmentof a receiver/conservator should the assistance efforts fail to restorethe institution to viability.(13) The institution would be expected to pursue claims against individualsor entities associated with or performing services for the institutionto the satisfaction of the FSLIC and with the guidance of the Board's Officeof General Counsel, including, without limitation, claims against directors,officers, employees, agents, stockholders, controlling persons, bondingand insurance companies, accountants, appraisers, attorneys, investmentbankers or brokers, and securities dealers. However, the association mustprovide the FSLIC with the option of assuming and pursuing at any time,on its own initiative, such claims of the institution. Recoveries by theFSLIC would be used to offset assistance paid to the institution and othercosts, including costs incurred in pursuing such claims.(14) Fee arrangements for attorneys, investment bankers, consultants, andother advisors incident to requests for FSLIC assistance pursuant to thisstatement of policy must be disclosed to the FSLIC and will be evaluatedin determining the cost of assistance to the FSLIC. Excessive fees mustbe avoided, and in no instance should the payment of any fee be contingentupon the level of financial assistance approved by the FSLIC.Assistance necessary to stabilize the institution pending a subsequentresolution action or to facilitate the rehabilitation of insolvent institutionswhen an immediate merger/acquisition by a third party is not feasible shouldmeet the following guidelines unless the Board determines that there arecompelling reasons justifying the contrary:(1) The estimated cost to the FSLIC clearly must be less than other readilyavailable options. The cost analyses should reflect the future risk eachavailable case resolution option represents for the FSLIC.(2) The FSLIC would be appointed as receiver and substantially all of theinstitution's assets and liabilities would be transferred by the receiverto a <T3>de novo </T3>institution. The receiver would transfer to the FSLICin its corporate capacity claims against individuals or entities associatedwith or performing services for the institution, including, without limitation,claims against directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, controllingpersons, bonding and insurance companies, accountants, appraisers, attorneys,investment bankers or brokers, and securities dealers.(3) Adequate managerial resources, sufficient projected capitalization,and a reasonable assurance of the future profitability of the institutiononce the assistance effort is complete must be provided for. The key determinantof sufficient projected capitalization should be that the rehabilitatedinstitution meet the Board's regulatory capital requirements at the conclusionof the rehabilitation assistance program.(4) The resulting <T3>de novo </T3>institution would be operated under safeguards designedfor the protection of the FSLIC. Incentives should be structured for managementundertaking the recovery effort in conjunction with the FSLIC that mirrorthe interests of the FSLIC. For example, management could be rewarded byan ownership interest in the institution that grows as the rehabilitationprogram progresses. Additionally, management would be encouraged to investa nominal amount of their own funds in the institution.(5) If the resulting <T3>de novo </T3>is a stock institution, the FSLIC would retain an substantialequity position in the institution via warrants and/or convertible preferredstock (the FSLIC cannot own voting or common stock). The FSLIC would beable to sell its ownership position to third parties at a later date. Therehabilitation should encourage the infusion of new private capital throughprivate or public offerings of common stock and/or the sale of the FSLIC'sequity interests as a way to expedite the rehabilitation of the institutionwith private capital.(6) The FSLIC and the ORA, or their designee, have the right to approve/disapproveofficers, directors, compensation, business plans, and budgets of the institutionduring the term of the rehabilitation assistance agreement.(7) The institution would accept FSLIC notes and/or other assets of theFSLIC for the payment of assistance.(8) The rehabilitation effort should involve the consolidation of otherinsolvent institutions to achieve the benefits of economies of scale.(9) Management responsible for the institution's insolvency shall be replacedwith new management approved by the FSLIC.(10) The institution must execute a ``pre-nuptial'' agreement with theFSLIC consenting to a merger/acquisition or the appointment of a receiver/conservatorshould the assistance efforts fail to restore the institution to viability.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
