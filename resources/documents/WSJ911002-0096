The proposed purchase, announced Monday by LosAngeles-based Unocal, will tighten supplies by closing somemajor facilities at the Los Angeles refineries of both Unocaland Shell, a Houston-based unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.The result will be a reduction of 60,000 barrels, or about 6%of California's gasoline refining capacity, in a market nowin the grip of oversupply, industry officials said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This should bring the market back into better balance,and it will make Unocal a stronger competitor,&quot; said ThomasG. Burns, manager of economics at Chevron Corp., whoseChevron U.S.A. unit is the second-largest gas retailer inCalifornia.   &quot;The price impact of this is up,&quot; said John Vautrain,manager of the Los Angeles office of Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc.,petroleum consultants.   Just how much prices may go up isn't clear. A rise ofseveral cents a gallon is a possibility. So depressed aregasoline prices currently in Californa, once the nation'smost profitable gasoline market, that Mr. Vautrain notes thatLos Angeles wholesale gasoline prices have slipped as much asfive cents a gallon below those of Houston. Usually, LosAngeles wholesale prices are about a nickel above Houston's.   Gasoline demand in California is off about 2% fromyear-earlier levels, said George Babikian, senior vicepresident of Atlantic Richfield Co., the market leader inCalifornia and most of the Western U.S. In January, demandwas off as much as 4% from year earlier, Mr. Babikian said.   Mr. Babikian said he was surprised by Unocal's purchaseagreement with Shell. Arco looked closely at the refinery anddecided not to buy it. &quot;I hadn't thought that Unocal would beall that interested,&quot; Mr. Babikian said.   California officials and the U.S. Justice Department areexpected to analyze the transaction closely. However, &quot;wedon't expect it to have a debilitating impact on supplies inthe state,&quot; said Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of theCalifornia Energy Commission, which oversees energy resourcesin the state.   For some years now, Unocal, the region's No. 4 marketer,has been losing its hold on the West Coast, slipping to abouta 9% share from about 12%. A relatively antiquated refineryhas left the company with high production costs, while a highdebt load limited its ability to modernize its facilities.   The purchase of Shell's facilities will allow Unocal touse heavier, less expensive crude oil while yielding moregasoline and other lighter petroleum products.   Shell's more up-to-date equipment is expected to makeUnocal far more competitive. The ability to purchase lowercost crude will put Unocal in &quot;fighting trim,&quot; said BernardJ. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.   At a meeting with financial analysts yesterday in NewYork, Unocal's senior vice president, marketing and refining,Roger Beach, estimated that the rearranged refineryfacilities would enable Unocal to cut its crude oil costs byan average of about $1.75 a barrel. He said that profits fromthe acquisition, which should be completed by year end, willstart to give earnings a lift by the second quarter of nextyear.   Unocal has declined to disclose the cost of the refinerypurchase. But analysts said after the meeting that theybelieve the purchase price could run between $350 million and$450 million. An additional $35 million would have to bespent to upgrade the facility and pipelines.   Mr. Beach said the purchase won't reduce by much aprojected eight-year outlay of $900 million to upgrade itsrefinery to produce reformulated gasoline and meetenvironmental requirements. But he said the acquisiton willbring a surge of cash flow at least 18 months earlier than ifUnocal proceeded with construction plans to upgrade its ownrefinery. These plans have included an estimated $515 millioninstallation of a so-called hydrotreater that would haveadded to the refinery's flexibility.</TEXT></DOC>
