It was the way he was treated: No severance pay, not even his promised pension.    So like a growing number of white-collar executives booted from their jobs, Mr. Ohanian didn't just get mad. He got even.    In 1985, a federal jury in New York found Avis had breached a verbal agreement securing Mr. Ohanian's job. When the appeals were over, Mr. Ohanian and his lawyer walked away with $365,000.    &quot;The money was terrific, but I wanted to clear my name,&quot; says Mr. Ohanian, now executive vice president of Ask Mr. Foster Travel Agency in New York.    Over the past decade, courts nationwide have become increasingly receptive to wrongful discharge claims. And many fired managers and executives are no longer satisfied with winning only back pay and promised bonuses. Many now press for punitive damages as well.    &quot;White-collar workers have always been victims of wrongful discharge,&quot; says Paul Tobias, founder and chairman of the Plaintiff Employment Lawyers Association in Cincinnati. The difference now is the eagerness of former managers to sue and a new willingness by courts in many states to apply traditional causes of action -- like defamation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy -- in the area of employment law.    As a result, we have &quot;a new era of employer-employee relationships,&quot; says Andrew M. Kramer, a management labor lawyer in Washington, D.C. Companies must rely more on lawyers in hiring and firing decisions. Some are offering fired employees handsome severance packages in return for written releases from future liability; others hope to avoid litigation by setting up internal arbitration programs.    For some companies, there may be some relief in sight. In January, the California Supreme Court ruled that a worker fired without just cause can usually sue for reinstatement and back pay but not punitive damages. And in July, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a new state law that protects workers against arbitrary dismissal while limiting the damages they can win.    But no one expects the surge of wrongful discharge suits to abate soon. Some two million workers who aren't covered by employment contracts or labor pacts are fired annually, and that doesn't include large-scale layoffs. Jack Steiber, a professor of law at Michigan State University, estimates that 150,000 of these workers are fired without just cause.    More than 25,000 wrongful discharge cases are pending in state and federal courts, according to a study for the Bureau of National Affairs, a private information service, that was released in February. The study estimates that wrongful discharge cases more than doubled between 1982 and 1987.    And the law firm of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler andamp; Krupman found that half of 1,014 industrial-relations executives said in a survey that terminating an employee in the past year resulted in some form of legal action.    &quot;All kinds of white-collar workers are filing these suits, whether they're making $30,000 or $300,000 a year,&quot; says James N. Dertouzos, a senior economist with Rand Corp.'s Institute for Civil Justice.    Money is a big reason. With high salaries, lucrative stock options, hefty bonus plans and retirement packages on the line, white-collar workers have more to lose by being fired and more resources with which to pay lawyers.    A Rand study released last year surveyed 120 wrongful discharge cases that went to trial in California between 1980 and 1986. The average salary of fired employees was $36,254. Plaintiffs won 67.5% of their cases and were awarded an average of $646,855. About 40% of the awards were for punitive damages.    An even bigger factor in the increase of cases is the growing willingness of courts to chip away at the old notion that companies can fire employees arbitrarily -- the so-called &quot;employment at will&quot; doctrine. Among the exceptions that are now generally recognized: instances when employees have received assurances, sometimes in employee handbooks, that they will be fired only for &quot;just cause&quot;; cases in which employers have acted in particularly bad faith; and situations where employees have been fired for performing a public duty, such as serving on a jury or refusing to break the law.    And now courts in many states -- notably California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and New York -- have gone further by permitting punitive damages in certain instances.    Take the case of Ian J. Dowie. The former office products executive for IBM-Canada was lured to Exxon in 1979 with promises of a division presidency, an eventual $100,000-a-year salary, hefty bonuses and a lucrative profit-sharing plan.    When none of the promises were honored and Mr. Dowie complained, he was fired in February 1983. He subsequently sued for breach of contract and fraud under New York law, and in July 1986 a federal jury awarded him $10.1 million in damages, $9 million of which was to punish Exxon. (Later, after Exxon appealed, the case was settled out of court, but the parties agreed not to disclose the terms.)    John O'Brien, a former area supervisor at Papa Gino's of America Inc., sued when he was fired in 1982 after being questioned about drug use. He argued that his privacy had been invaded because he was questioned with a lie detector about his use of drugs before he started working at the fast-food chain. A jury agreed and awarded him $448,200 in compensatory and punitive damages, and an appeals court upheld the award three years ago.    The most lucrative damage awards in wrongful discharge cases have been for defamation, perhaps because judges in most states are already familiar with it as a cause of action in other kinds of cases. According to the Bureau of National Affairs study, plaintiffs recovered damages in 78.9% of all defamation claims filed against former employers.    After insurance executive Larry W. Buck was fired from his $80,000-a-year job with Frank B. Hall andamp; Co. in Houston, he found no one would consider him for another job. He became suspicious and hired a private detective to find out what his former associates were saying about him.    &quot;A classical sociopath . . . a zero,&quot; Mr. Buck's former office manager told the detective. &quot;A real Jekyll and Hyde personality.&quot; The manager made similar remarks to at least one prospective employer.    Mr. Buck sued for defamation, on top of breach of contract, and won $1.9 million in punitive and compensatory damages, a decision an appeals court upheld in 1984.    In some states, courts have ruled against employers that made defamatory statements to employees they were firing. When six claims approvers for Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. refused company demands to change their expense accounts after a business trip, they were fired for &quot;gross insubordination.&quot;    Equitable never repeated the phrase to anyone; the six former employees did. They contended that they had no choice when questioned by prospective employers about why they had left. In 1986, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed, and appeals courts in Michigan and California have made similar rulings.    Because of the risks, many companies no longer give meaningful evaluations of former employees to outsiders. But Georgia-Pacific Corp. still ran into trouble. When it fired William Benassi, a former general manager in Portland, Ore., several years ago, his successor gathered the staff together to explain why. Among the reasons cited was drinking on a business trip, charges that Mr. Benassi successfully refuted when he sued Georgia-Pacific for defamation and won $350,000 in damages.    Mr. Kramer, the management labor lawyer, recommends that employers protect themselves against suits by avoiding promises that can be construed as a contract. He adds that employee handbooks should maintain the company's right to fire employees at will.    A worker suspected of lying shouldn't be accused of dishonesty, says Gloria J. Shanor, senior counsel for labor and employment at Georgia-Pacific. Rather, she says, the company should indicate it has lost confidence in the employee's credibility.    &quot;There are ways to get the point across without stepping into a defamation cow pie,&quot; she adds. @ --- @ Behind the Growth in Wrongful Discharge Suits @ Breaking Down Those Who Sue... @ By Race @ White ....................................... ... 89.3% @ Non-White ...................................... 10.7% @ By Sex @ Male ....................................... .... 68.6% @ Female ....................................... .. 31.4% @ By Job @ Executive ...................................... 13.6% @ Middle @ Management ..................................... 39.8% @ Other ....................................... ... 46.6% @ ...And the Verdicts @ Plaintiff verdicts: 67.5% @ Defendant verdicts: 32.5% @ Average compensation award: $388,500 @ (81 cases) @ Average punitive awared: $523,170 @ (40 cases) @ Note: The data are from a 1988 Rand Corp.
