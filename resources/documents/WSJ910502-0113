As president of the largestrank-and-file police organization in the U.S., I can tell youthat law enforcement knows the Brady Bill will save lives andprevent needless injuries.   The bill requires a national seven-day waiting period forhandgun purchases so local police can verify the purchaser'seligibility. Every major police organization supports itspassage. We know that in states that already have waitingperiods and background checks, police are stopping thousandsof felons each year -- many of whom, wanted by police inother states, are arrested and prosecuted.</LP><TEXT>   You state that the Brady Bill won't work because there isno registry of known felons for dealers' use (and that theBrady Bill won't create one). No one contends dealers shouldbe consulting any list of known felons -- for their ownprotection as well as for privacy reasons. That is the jobfor police. The point you miss is that local police have atremendous amount of information at their disposal now --computer and manual records of prior arrests, convictions,imprisonment, etc. Although there is a great need to improverecordkeeping and the ability to share this data nationwide,police identify felons every day in the course of regularwork.   You also suggest that because &quot;only&quot; 17% of felons claimto have purchased handguns from dealers, we needn't botherattempting to stop them. How high a percentage does this needto be before it warrants action? The source of the 17% figureis based on one study of hard-core, incarcerated male felons.(A study completed by the National Institute of Justiceindicates that the number is 22%.) It says nothing abouthandgun-wielding criminals as a whole. If, as you claim, it'sso easy to buy handguns on the black market, why don't the17% of felons go there first? Why bother with the paper workat a gun dealer? Also, remember that the guns on theso-called black market start out from a gun dealer somewhere.What do you think people who buy upward of 50 guns at a timein states with no waiting periods are planning to do with theguns? Right -- they resell them on the black markets ofcities where there are tough gun laws.   I disagree with your claim, &quot;As with the drug problem, theonly solution to crimes with guns is on the demand side.&quot;Where have you been for the past 20 years? Yes, we need toreduce the demand for drugs and guns. But as with drugs, itis the proper role for the federal government to assist inthe reduction of the supply. As we're trying to stop thepipeline of drugs from South America, we should also work toshut off the easy flow of handguns into criminal hands, andthe flow of weapons to South America and Mexico that aretraded for illegal drugs.   Dewey R. Stokes   National President   Fraternal Order of Police   Columbus, Ohio   ---   Your claim that the Brady Bill would do no good but woulddo little or no harm either was only half-right. There are atleast three ways in which it could do harm:   -- By adding a vague and peculiar definition of &quot;handgun,&quot;dealers could risk imprisonment for not correctly guessingwhich rifles or shotguns fall into that definition.   -- By prohibiting any transfer before local lawenforcement acknowledged receipt of an application fortransfer, while expressly exempting local law enforcementfrom any obligation to acknowledge receipt, some would-bebuyers could be prohibited by law-enforcement inaction fromever lawfully buying a handgun from a dealer, with noapparent legal recourse.   -- By this threat, while the background check by local lawenforcement is supposedly optional, Handgun Control's501(c)(3) spinoff, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,has said, &quot;When we sue a municipality for its negligence innot carefully screening handgun applicants, we show state andlocal governments . . . we mean business when we say we wantto keep handguns out of the wrong hands -- the criminals, thementally ill, and others who must not be allowed to purchasethem.&quot;   Such a threat, combined with poor records and sparsebudgets for careful background checks, could encourage somelocal law enforcement to simply not acknowledge receipt ofpurchase applications. That's an onerous risk for a bill youcorrectly note wouldn't affect criminals.   Paul H. Blackman   National Rifle Association of America   Institute for Legislative Action   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
