The Michigan Travel Bureau plans to spend $250,000 on advertisingin cities along Interstate 75, which ends in southern Florida,spokeswoman Sue Wagner said. The ads will target Florida, she said.   ``We know there are a lot of Floridians who went to school inMichigan, worked in Michigan, have family in Michigan. They're ourmain target,'' bureau director John Savich said Tuesday.   ``If we can get the average Floridian who by July has had monthsof hot, muggy weather, we'll be happy to get them, too,'' he said.   Tourism is Michigan's second-largest industry followingmanufacturing, worth $16 billion a year. Most tourists come from theGreat Lakes region, though. Michigan wants to become a nationaltourism draw.   The ads will use themes like, ``Come up to the cool Michigansummers,'' Wagner said. The campaign also will stress festivals,golfing and other outdoor activities, she said.   ``We referred to it as the Sweat Belt'' in brain-stormingsessions, Wagner said.   Raphael Marcucci of the Florida Department of Commerce said hewasn't worried about the competition.   ``A beach on a Great Lake'' isn't the same as one on the AtlanticOcean or the Gulf of Mexico, he said in a telephone interview fromTallahassee.</TEXT><DATELINE>ROCK FALLS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Call it the ``wheel of misfortune.''That's what a woman feels about the popular television game showafter receiving prizes she says were used, filthy and damaged.   ``I just wanted to go on `Wheel of Fortune' and have a goodtime,'' said Debra Stuker, 30, who appeared on the show 15 monthsago. ``And I did have a good time _ it was a lot of fun.   ``Now, all the problems have kind of ruined it.''   Mrs. Stuker said her winnings included a $4,200 jukebox thatarrived at her northern Illinois home used, dirty and with partsmissing.   She also said the sparkling $10,000 blue canopied dinghy shepicked out turned up with a broken windshield, cracks in thefiberglass, splotches of tar on the hull and dirty, torn upholstery.   A representative of the Merv Griffin Enterprises show saidofficials are working on the complaints. The representative declinedto give her name.   Mrs. Stuker was the show's big winner for two days, garnering$36,829 worth of prizes including a Jeep, a sailboat, a smallmotorboat, artwork, sportswear and sporting equipment.   She and her husband, Michael, forfeited some items they didn'twant, but still got hit for $1,300 in federal and California statetaxes on the prizes.   ``We got the Jeep, and it was nice _ we traded it in for a van,''Stuker said. ``We got the TV and the VCR and some other nicethings.''   But then the jukebox and the boat arrived. The couple's lawyer,Al Williams, has a file of letters indicating the Stukers' repeatedattempts to have the problem corrected.   The Stukers refused the game show's offer of $2,500 in cash inlieu of the $4,200 jukebox. The show took back the boat but hasn'toffered a replacement.   ``We don't want to be greedy but anybody in their right mindwould want this stuff if they had it coming to them,'' Stuker said.</TEXT></DOC>
