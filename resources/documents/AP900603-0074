Gorbachev endedsummit talks on Sunday promising to work with President Bush towarda solution to Germany's military future but sternly warning Israeland independence-minded Lithuanians on other issues.   Gorbachev said he had surveyed with Bush ``new possibleperspectives'' on Germany. One of them, Secretary of State James A.Baker III said, might be a ``political agreement'' between the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.   ``I cannot say that we have reached agreement, but that does notmean that our efforts were futile,'' Gorbachev said of his dogged _and unsuccessful _ campaign to persuade Bush that a unified Germanyshould not be aligned against the Soviet Union.   Bush, at their joint news conference, insisted that a unitedGermany in NATO ``would be stabilizing'' and said he did not thinkhis differences with Gorbachev on the issue had been narrowed duringtheir four days of talks.   But the two leaders parted amicably. ``The atmosphere and theresults of this meeting make it possible for us to speak really of anew phase of cooperation,'' Gorbachev said.   Baker will pursue the German question with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze while they attend a Europeansecurity conference on human rights this week in Copenhagen,Denmark, and again, in Berlin, later in the month.   ``Conceivably there could be some sort of a political agreementof some sort'' to help the East and Central Europeans accept Germanmembership in NATO, Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''   ``There are some ideas'' for resolving the German question, Bakersaid. He said those ideas came from the United States, the SovietUnion and the NATO allies. Among those were many that have beenpreviously mentioned: a more political role for NATO and the plan,forwarded by West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, tokeep NATO troops out of territory now part of East Germany.   ``We'll keep wrestling with it,'' he said.   Other U.S. officials said last week that Gorbachev had proposedcreation of a new all-European council to consider militaryquestions arising from the impending merger of East Germany and WestGermany. Among them would be the size of the German army.   On two other summit issues _ Jewish emigration from the SovietUnion and the drive for independence in Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia _ Gorbachev took a tough stand in reply to reporters'questions.   Having permitted Jewish emigration to soar to an all-time high _some 20,000 exit permits were issued in May _ Gorbachev alignedhimself with Arab leaders who, he said, had protested in ``acuteterms'' the continuing settlement of Jews by Israel on the West Bankand in Gaza.   If ``certain conclusions'' are not reached in Jerusalem, theSoviet leader said, ``we must give further thought to it in terms ofwhat we can do with issuing permits for exit.''   Bush, meanwhile, reiterated U.S. opposition to furthersettlements on the lands surrendered by Jordan and Egypt in their1967 war with Israel. ``I will try to persuade the government ofIsrael that it is counterproductive,'' he said.   Baker said the Soviets had told him last month in Moscow and onother occasions that they might suspend Jewish emigration ifrefugees are permitted to live on the West Bank and in Gaza.   ``They have a great deal more trouble with that than we do,''Baker said. While the Bush administration is opposed to thesettlements it firmly supports Jewish emigration, he said.   Bush said he would not consider lowering U.S. tariffs on Sovietimports until the Soviet parliament enacts a new law establishingemigration as a right.   On the Baltics, an area of sharp disagreement although Bushdeclined to let it stand in the way of a new trade pact with Moscow,the Soviet leader insisted that the drive for independence bechanneled through constitutional means.   Any other approach, Gorbachev said, ``leads only to an impasse.''   ``Our Constitution has recorded the right for each people to makea choice for self-determination up to and including secession,'' hesaid. And, he added, the sovereign rights of the Soviet republicswere being expanded.   Lithuanians and other people ``trying to resolve the problem bydifferent methods, without due regard for the Constitution, leads toexacerbation, aggravation and confrontation,'' Gorbachev said.``This is not beneficial either for people, for their families, orfor the economy, or for the overall atmosphere in our country.''   Bush, in turn, called U.S.-Soviet differences over Lithuania``one of the thorns in the side of an overall relationship.''   After Gorbachev left, a senior U.S. official said the Sovietleader was ``in full accord'' with Bush that Germans had the rightto make a decision about NATO membership by virtue of the 1975Helsinki agreement signed by 35 nations.   ``It's the first time he has done that with the president,'' saidthe official, who sought out reporters while insisting he not bequoted by name or be otherwise identified.   ``He said that he agreed that this was up to the German people todecide,'' the official said. ``We'll have to see what that means,''   Gorbachev, speaking at the news conference on what he called``external aspects'' of German unification _ meaning how the newcountry would relate to other European nations _ said the two sideshad clarified their positions and ``we will continue our discussionin order to find a mutually acceptable solution.''</TEXT></DOC>
