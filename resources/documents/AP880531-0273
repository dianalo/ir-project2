So extensive and eclectic is her knowledge that she can talkabout literature in the years following the American Revolution andalso tell you which states have the highest populations ofporcupines.   Although best known for her highly acclaimed novel, ``TheHandmaid's Tale,'' Atwood first gained recognition for her poetry.Her ``Selected Poems II: Poems Selected and New 1976-86'' has justbeen released by Houghton Mifflin Paperbacks.   There are poems about love and Siamese twins, and poems aboutpoets.   ``There's a perception of their social role,'' she said abouther fellow poets. ``It wasn't always that way but now people thinkyou can't be a poet without being drunk. Women poets are expectedto commit suicide. Someone once asked me when, not if, I wouldcommit suicide.   ``I prefer to live, thank you very much.''</TEXT><TEXT>   From ``The Words Continue Their Journey,'' a selection from1984's ``Interlunar'':   ``Do poets really suffer more   ``than other people? Isn't it only   ``that they get their pictures taken   ``and are seen to do it?   ``The loony bins are full of those   ``who never wrote a poem.   ``Most suicides are not   ``poets: a good statistic.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Atwood was born in 1939 in Ottawa. Although one of her auntsclaims that she announced her intentions to become a writer at theage of five, Atwood said she did not seriously begin writing untilshe was 16.   She was 19 when her first poem was accepted for publication. Herfirst volume of poetry, ``Persephone,'' was published in 1961. In1966, a collection of poems entitled ``The Circle Game'' won theGovernor General's Award as the year's best book of poetry. ``TheCircle Game'' sold 10,000 copies, a then unheard of total in Canadafor works of poetry.   ``In 1960, in English Canada, there were five novels published.You were doing very well to sell 1,000 novels,'' Atwood said.``When my first poems were published, they told me they hadoverprinted _ 450 copies instead of 400.''   She has written several novels besides ``The Handmaid's Tale,''including ``Surfacing,'' ``Lady Oracle'' and ``Life Before Man.''She has released two collections of short stories, two children'sbooks and several works of criticism, notably 1972's ``Survival,''an analysis of Canadian literature. She is currently completing anew novel, ``Cat's Eye.''   Atwood, who lives in Toronto, travels frequently and creditsthis with helping her writing.   ``Traveling takes me out of my environment,'' she said. ``Itgives me clear time. It's not the same as being in the office withthe phone ringing all day. It also gives me context for my owncountry.''   Some parts of the world are more conducive for her writing thanothers. ``England in the winter is a great place to write. Hawaiion the beach is not.''   Atwood became more politically involved in the 1970s. Her workdisplayed her interest in power _ how it works, how people use it,how people react to it.   In the poem ``Marrying the Hangman,'' from her 1978 collection,``Two-Headed Poems,'' she tells the story of a woman who iscondemned to death by hanging for stealing her employer's clothesand can only escape her fate by marrying the hangman:   ``She has been condemned to death by hanging. A man may escapethis   ``death by becoming the hangman, a woman by marrying the hangman.   ``But at the present time there is no hangman; thus there is noescape.   ``There is only a death, indefinitely postponed. This is notfantasy, it is history.''   The poem is about the choices people must make when confrontingan unjust system.   ``It depends on the circumstances. Sometimes you have nooptions; other times you have more,'' she said. ``A womanundergoing sexual harassment at work has more options than thewoman who must marry the hangman.   ``In the best of all possible worlds, you wouldn't have to makethese choices, but it's not the best of all possible worlds.''   While Atwood has been involved in a number of causes, hergreatest concern is the environment.   ``Forests are being cut down. If the forests are all gone, wewill choke to death,'' she said. ``The ozone layer is beingdestroyed. This stuff is scary for everybody.''   Atwood is critical of American writers who fail to integrate thepolitical world into their work, although she cites E.L. Doctorowand Marge Piercy as notable exceptions.   ``In the United States, writing is an individual thing,'' shesaid. ``It's the only country where people believe that. It'snatural for American writers _ a habit of mind.''   However, she does see this changing.   ``They live in a secure country. I predict, mark my words, asthe United States feels less secure, you'll see more integration inthe writing,'' she said.   ``A young person who wanted to become a writer asked me forsuggestions on how to suffer,'' Atwood said. ``Everybody suffers.You don't have to find ways to suffer. Just live, you'll suffer.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, June 10-12 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
