The main application field of AI in energy industriesis the progress in the operation and administration of facilities toimprove reliability and profitability. In addition, there is applicationof AI to the business and the management of the industries, and to researchand development of energy systems. From technical point of view, it canbe concluded, AI has not reached the level to be useful in practice,and almost all of the application fields in energy industries are expectedto realize in future.
