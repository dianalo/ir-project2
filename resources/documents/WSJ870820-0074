KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTENVIRONMENT (ENV)CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON   </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department, under federal court order, issued rules expanding the scope of its requirement that employers inform workers who are exposed, or face possible exposure, to hazardous substances.    As a result of the expansion, the hazard-communication rule will cover more than 32 million workers -- those under the jurisdiction of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- who could be subject to such exposure, OSHA said. An estimated 14 million manufacturing workers already are covered. When the rule is fully effective, on May 20, 1988, it will apply to an additional 18.4 million non-manufacturing employees.    OSHA estimated that the expanded standard will reduce chemical-related injuries, illnesses and deaths by 20% in non-manufacturing workplaces.    Unions applauded the OSHA move, but they said even the expanded hazard-communication rule falls short of giving workers the kind of notice contemplated in tough legislation pending in Congress. Unions favor the legislation, called the high-risk, occupational-disease notification bill.    The legislation would create a new agency within the Health and Human Services Department. It would assess the health risk faced by workers exposed to toxic chemicals, radiation and other hazards, and it would require the government or employers to notify the employees of the exposure.    Many industry groups vehemently oppose the legislation, contending it will make employers vulnerable to widespread worker-liability lawsuits. Some business groups and companies are backing the bill, though. The opponents, including the Reagan administration, prefer a substitute bill that would buttress OSHA's more-modest expansion of its hazard-communication rule.    OSHA had long been working on a proposed regulation that would have provided for the gathering more information on the technical feasibility of expanding the hazard-communication rule. But a federal appeals court on May 29 ordered the agency to speed its timetable and issue a final rule quickly. The court initially had ordered OSHA to broaden the rule in 1985.    Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said additional evidence concerning the feasibility of the rule may still be needed, and he invited interested parties to offer such data to the agency within 60 days. Once that information is evaluated, OSHA will decide whether further action is necessary, Mr. White said.    The cost to industry of complying with the expanded standard will be about $687 million in the first year, but will decline yearly after that, OSHA said. </TEXT></DOC>
