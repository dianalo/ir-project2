The City of London Police said its fraud department is investigating the theft of nearly 82 million Swiss francs ($54.1 million), transferred from the bank to Nyon, Switzerland, using a computer-based switching system and fraudulent instructions.    In a brief statement late yesterday, London police said Swiss police had helped to freeze the transferred money. A number of people in Switzerland and London currently are helping police with their inquiries, the statement added.    The police declined to name the bank or give further details of the alleged crime. If proven, it could represent one of Britain's biggest computer frauds involving a bank. </TEXT></DOC>
