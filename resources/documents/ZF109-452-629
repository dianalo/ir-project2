 There's a big difference between a relationaldatabase front-ended by object-oriented tools, applications or data models,and a true object-oriented database.andP;  In many cases  - for most traditionalapplications, in fact  - Simply extending a relational  database is thepreferable approach, especially since the data is probably already in arelational database and things work okay as they are.andM;Object-oriented databases are for data that is so complex and richlystructured that it isn't in a database yet; generally, it's on paper, or atbest in application-specific files inaccessible to other applications.andP;  OODBsare for new applications, such as CAD/CAM, computer-aided softwareengineering, heavy-duty text manipulation (not just storage and retrieval,but document generation and assembly, multi-page periodical and cataloguelayout, version management and other more complex tasks), expert systems andother design applications.andP;  These are applications where you are manipulatingnot the data within the structures, but the structures and relationshipsthemselves.andM;This is a key point, and it reflects the direction we are taking in the 90s:Routine tasks are being automated and are performed automatically.andP;  The areawhere we most need computer help is the design, integration, maintenance,enhancement and modification of those automated routines.andP;  (For background onthe vendors and on how object-oriented databases work, see Release 1.0, 89-9.andO;88-12, 88-9 and 87-8.)andM;The commercial newsandM;The pioneers Servio and Ontologic, with 130 and 150 customers respectively,are launching second releases of GemStone, shipping for three years, andOntos, the successor to Vbase and first shipped a year ago.andP;  Other firms whoannounced their existence a year or two ago are now announcing the existenceof customers and the availability of products.andP;  They include Itasca, formerlyArtemis, with Itasca, based on MCC's Orion; Objectivity, with Objectivity/DBand a cooperation agreement with DEC; Object Design, with ObjectStore;Versant Object Technology, formerly Object-Sciences, with its Versant line.andO;Overall pricing levels are lover, down from as much as $25,000 for the firstunit, to half that or less in most cases.andP;  Although a broad market isbecoming visible, there seem to be almost as many vendors as customers.andM;&quot;Everyone is still trying to figure out how to use OODBS,&quot; says Itasca salesandamp; marketing vp Bill Hoffman, formerly with AI firms Gold Hill and Symbolics.andO;&quot;All the business plans add up to about five times the entire potentialmarket.&quot;andM;Potential customers now have products to compare, reference accounts to call- and the nagging suspicion that if they don't step up to object-orienteddatabases their competitors may get a jump on them.andP;  Pilot applicationsinclude not just electronics, but also office automation and softwareengineering.andP;  A variety of vendors of document and image-processing systemssuch as Kodak are testing object-oriented databases as foundations for theirsystems, while US West is considering OODBs not just for modelingtelecommunications networks, but also for billing commercial customers wherecharges depend on complex interactions among assets and services, timing andamount of usage, regulatory constraints and other factors.andP;  All theseactivities serve to make the technology seem less exotic and more real andpractical.andM;Customers are frequently buying evaluation copies from several vendors at atime.andP;  They include not just -onics and -tech companies and research outfits,but firms such as Martin Marietta, Boeing, General Dynamics, Mitsubishi,Citicorp, British Petroleum, IBM, DEC, Japan's NTT and most of the formerBell operating companies.andP;  An airline and a couple of hardware companies arelooking at OODBs as a foundation for office automation.andP;  (No onlinetransaction-processing, though.)andM;Standards: Object(ions to Object) SQLandM;The big sticking point is a lack of standards  - and customers, fears ofbeing stuck with the wrong choice through lack of expertise and experience.andO;Aside from words, you can't commit to object-oriented databases in general,and few people want to commit yet to one in particular  - which is why DEC'sendorsement of Objectivity is so important.andP;  &quot;Customers wanted thistechnology, but they weren't comfortable buying it from an independent thirdparty unless it had real support from a system vendor [such as DEC],&quot; saysDEC's object-based systems manager Lydia Bennett.andP;  Our commitment is real;we'll be making more announcements about Objectivity, including somethingwith Trellis.&quot; Trellis is DEC's object-oriented development environmentprototype - highly successful and in evaluation at several large companies,says Bennett.andP;  (Only hardware vendors can afford such long beta cycles ...andP;  )andO;on the other hand, customers don't want to buy a product that would run onDEC equipment alone, and Objectivity's independence and multi-vendor stanceis an important part of its appeal to its customers and therefore to DEC (cf.andO;the relationships between IBM and Microsoft and Metaphor).andM;Isn't defining a query/data manipulation language enough? Unfortunately, no.andO;That gulf between programming languages and database languages is exactlywhat object-oriented databases are trying to bridge.andP;  It's time to overcomethe impedance mismatch between languages and databases, say the OODBers.andP;  Thegulf between procedural and data languages was annoying; the gulf betweenobject-oriented languages and database languages will be worse.andP;  The essenceof object-orientation is the closeness of data and programs.andM;That's the case made by Object Design, which has decided to standardize onC++ and offers an optional modification (implemented in its C++ Cfrontpreprocessor) to create persistent objects automatically and almostseamlessly.andP;  Competitors charge that this makes ObjectStore nonstandard, eventhough it's optional, and ODI now stresses that you can also createpersistent objects the &quot;regular&quot; way, with subroutines called from C++ orother languages.andP;  You still can't use those subroutines for other OODBs, norcan you use theirs for ObjectStore, so this strikes us as an overblown issuefor ODI (but one ultimately needing a standard solution for everyone).andO;Meanwhile, some customers who want an OODB rather than an illusory safesolution appreciate ObjectStore's seamlessness.andM;All for one or one for allandM;On the other hand, the ability to segregate all the database issues in aseparate language is labor-saving in the extreme: Who wants to extend allcurrent computer languages, especially if we want them all to be able tointeract with the same database? The extensions would have to be similar, sothey would fit awkwardly with each language anyway.andP;  Those who most want toput the database into the language are generally working on the assumptionthat there's only one language that really matters  - C++.andM;Servio's Jacob Stein: &quot;We OODB vendors need a dairy council:  Drink milk;it's good for you.' We don't even care what brand.&quot;andM;As people outside the C++ world come to see the value of OODBs, we expect theworld to resign itself to the gulf between programming and databaselanguages.andP;  But it would be a lot easier if OODB vendors could at least agreeon an Object SQL standard, which would also provide a bridge from therelational world.andP;  Work on such a standard is going on at several standardsgroups, including the CAD Framework Initiative and the ANSI OODB Task Group(page 16).andP;  These standards will specify how to tell any database to store anobject, and shouldn't require much work for all the vendors to support assubroutine libraries.andP;  Unfortunately, they won't quickly solve the reallytough problems of interoperability and interchangeability of objects at ameaningful level.andP;  The goal is to standardize not just on how to get objectsin and out, but how to determine their structures and relationships, how tomanipulate them, make them persistent and the like.andP;  How do you overrideinheritance; how do you indicate no value or no information versus 0 or&quot;definitely not&quot;? Precisely because objects have more character than simpledata elements, there are more issues to consider.andM;&quot;New, improved, now with objects&quot; vs.andP;  &quot;Object-oriented from scratch&quot;andM;There is a fundamental difference between databases with objects andobject-oriented databases.andP;  The first extends the relational database modelby allowing it to include objects where you would expect a simple string orvalue in a field, and perhaps by adding some interesting syntax to the datalanguage to handle hierarchies of inheritance or composition (is-a-kind-ofand is-a-part-of, respectively), and relationships such as distance.andP;  Theother is object-oriented all the way, with a storage system that maintainsthe relationships among objects and between objects and methods, and thatclusters hierarchies together and (ideally) locks objects, not pages.andM;Some argue that you can extend the relational model enough to make it afull-fledged object-oriented database.andP;  Oracle senior architect David Beech,for one, posits that relational is just a special case of object-oriented: Atable is a special kind of  class; the rows are objects, with relationshipslisted in the fields as keys  instead of pointers.andP;  A part, for example,could have a list of all the  items that use it.andP;  All we have to do is handlemore kinds of objects, while  keeping referential integrity, portability,reliability, SQL and the other  wonderful things relational brought us.andP;  Thiswould give you a structurally object-oriented database, but the structurewould be added on, with relationships listed in tuples that are derived byvalue matches rather than directly  - a process that gets slow inextremis.[1]andM;History teaches that pioneers start fresh; they may start from others'shoulders, but they build their new implementations from scratch.andM;Another important component of an object-oriented database, the methods andtheir binding to objects in multiple hierarchies, can be represented asapplications that reside in the database at the server rather than out therewith the client applications.andP;  Sybase with its stored procedures and Ingreswith triggers and some other extensions have already taken serious steps inthis direction.andP;  If the database supports methods (encapsulated procedures,or executable code) and the process of inheritance, overriding and otherobject-oriented processes, it is behaviorally object-oriented.andP;  But again,this is a hacked-on kludge instead of a system intimately supported andmaintained by the database.andP;  (You can also do object-oriented programming inC or even COBOL.) The point of an object-oriented database is that thedatabase knows about these things and makes them work consistently.andM;[1] There's no reason that relational vendors can't move to other physicalstorage systems, says Beech, with object-oriented clustering, access methodsand indexes.andP;  (Of course, you can also denormalize, but if you do so yourdatabase is no longer truly relational ...)andM;The function of the object-oriented database is not just data storage  -which it may do with its own optimized, physical-level capabilities orthrough the medium of an RDB as makes sense  - but maintenance of dataintegrity at a higher level than an RDB can.andP;  That is, a relational data basemaintains the integrity of the data elements, while an OODB manages theconsistency of the object structures  - often over long periods of time wherethe conflicts must be recognized and maintained as unresolved but needingreconciliation ultimately.andP;  Trying to represent these constraints asapplications is complex, and subject to error and bypass by otherapplications.andP;  The whole point is to get them into the database  - for use byapplications rather than as peers to applications.andM;Object-oriented databases represent the ultimate in reuse and sharing ofcode.andP;  The complex interrelationships and interactions of objects and methodsneed to be represented only once ...andP;  and are then maintained for all usersand applications.andP;  Application programmers avoid redundant efforts.andM;Hybrid vigor? Or just a mediocre jack of all trades?andM;Beech is right, in theory.andP;  At some point, some of these extended relationaldatabases may work as well, but it won't be that one side or the other haswon.andP;  Rather, the two will merge and hardware will handle performance.andM;The question is whether people who grew up in the narrow world of relationaldata and files have the mindset to make it in the broader realm of objects.andO;Much as we may think we're dealing only with technology, and high technologyat that, we're also dealing with subtleties and attitudes  - the same thingsthat keep most mainframe people from designing good interfaces, most Cprogrammers from learning Smalltalk, and most reporters from writing poetry.andM;In the end, relational databases aren't optimized for the tasks OODBs eat forbreakfast.andP;  DEC's Lydia Bennett, who spent more than a year making businessand technical evaluations of the leading contenders, ultimately concludedthat extended relational systems just couldn't cut it on the tasks for whichOODBs are suited, although in other cases, with mostly record-oriented datawith objects attached, they work fine.andP;  It boils down to the relativeimportance of structure versus data values.andM;Of course, customers don't like change any more than vendors do.andP;  They wanttheir new problems solved in new ways, but they don't want much disruption,just incremental improvements, in the systems they've built with great painand expense to handle their existing problems.andP;  If it were a question ofmoving from RDB to OODB for the same applications and data, the evolutionaryapproach would likely win, but this is new stuff for new applications.andM;Peaceful coexistence with territorial integrityandM;The traditional second-generation database vendors are amassing their forcesto stop the onslaught of the object-oriented database vendors  -unnecessarily, we believe.andP;  Co-existence is necessary.andP;  Relational databasescannot hope to do all the work of the object-oriented databases, nor canobject-oriented databases hope to hold all the data and handle all theroutine transactions that the RDBs currently do.andP;  This war may be somethingof a bust for the warring factions (albeit a good source of military spendingfor the marketers and other support troops).andM;The essence of object-orientation is run-time binding and ad-hocness ofprocedures; if you're following regular procedures, you can get betterperformance with canned, procedural applications; and if you're performingregular procedures with regular data, you can get the beat performance of allwith an old-fashioned Codasyl or network database.andP;  It's important thatdatabases work together, not that they take on each other's functions orcapabilities.andP;  In many cases, object-oriented databases will call on RDBs fordata.andP;  You could even get at an ISAM database using an object-orientedfront-end (see page 19 on Sybase's support for access to mainframe databaseapplications).andM;DEC has helped the case both for OODBs and for coexistence, by stating thatObjectivity is  complementary&quot; to its own relational database, RDB, and thede facto standard on DEC and UNIX, Oracle.andP;  We have the ability to beimpartial as a database vendor and sell both kinds,&quot; says DEC's Bennett, &quot;andto understand that we aren't cannibalizing our relational business.&quot; The realde facto standard is SQL  - all the other differences, you might argue, arejust implementation details.andP;  The implications of this are interesting.andO;First of all, it seems that DEC has decided that it's important to have anobject-oriented database, but it realized from Oracle's success thatcustomers don't want a proprietary&quot; system  - i.e., one available only fromDEC. (In a hardware view of the world, software from a single vendoravailable on a variety of hardware platforms evidently doesn't count asproprietary.)andM;From the point of view of the RDB, the OODB is just an application.andM;From the point of view of the OODB, the RDB is just a source of data.andM;Right nov, the world is caught up in an insistence on standards and findingthe one right way to do everything.andP;  Longer-term, we may realize that thereare many ways to do something, or more accurately, we may better understandthe differences among the things we're trying to do.andP;  (In the same way, youneed different tools for handling data on a desktop from those you need on anotepad; this makes sense once you recognize that the tasks also differsubtly from platform to platform.andP;  Data transfer, yes; slavish imitation, no.andO;See Release 1.0, 90-6.)andM;The result: Warlike coexistenceandM;Will the relational vendors suffer the fate of Cullinet, which ignoredrelational until it vas too late? In the end Cullinet's problem wasn't thateveryone switched to relational but that new applications went to relationalwhile most old ones stayed with IBM.andP;  Moreover, the data the relationalsystems hold is fundamentally the same data the old Codasyl and networkdatabases held, making conversion difficult but a reasonable thing to do.andO;(Even so, not all that much has been converted; it's mostly new applicationswith new data or decision-support with the same data).andM;By contrast, object-oriented vendors and users are generally dealing with newdata.[2] Thus traditional relational database vendors needn't fear that userswill switch to object-oriented databases.andP;  What they should fear is that thefocus of greatest growth has moved on, from automating data-intensive tasksto assisting in the performance of structure-intensive tasks such as design,configuration and the maintenance of knowledge bases.andM;[2] They might argue that all data is object-oriented; we've just limited itsrichness artificially in order to stuff it into nasty, dry, restrictiverelational databases.andP;  Yes, but when you're doing online transactionprocessing you really don't care about holistic data; you care about speedand one or two data elements and that's all.andM;Common senseandM;While building an object-oriented database is a complex task, it's not themystery it may seem.andP;  Like artificial intelligence, it leaves you asking, Isthat all there is? Like AI, it's not impressive on a small scale; its magicis managing a huge volume of things consistently rather than handling anysingle small thing with insight or true  intelligence,&quot; whatever that is.andM;An RDB gives  you one kind of flexibility: Each data item appears once andcan be linked at runtime in any way based on matching values.andP;  Anobject-oriented database gives you a different kind of flexibility inapplication programming: Much of the application can be written at a highlevel, and the actual implementation is determined at runtime based on theobjects used.andM;The OODB vendors are wrestling with the tough problems of optimizing datastorage and managing high-level consistency across users, databases,transactions and time.andP;  Consider an object-oriented database as one where theindexes are more important than the data.andP;  The relationships are maintainedto other objects and to each object's own and inherited attributes andbehavior.andP;  That is, the system maintains the relationships between the itemswith permanent pointers, and optimizes the storage locations to reflect thoserelationships; the values within the items are secondary.andP;  By contrast, atraditional database simply holds the data in sequenced files and lets theapplication run through them; a relational database lets you get at the databy values in fields, including joins where values match.andP;  The RDB is cleanand abstract, instead of preconfigured, and it means that there's a lot ofredundant application code, even though there's no redundant data.andM;Who's using them? What for?andM;The first, leading-edge users of object-oriented databases tend to beengineers or designers.andP;  They routinely work with enormous numbers ofelements which interact with each other, fit together, and share features andbehavior - call them instances of objects and classes.andP;  The users of theOODBs work together on large, complex, interacting systems; they changethings in processes that may take minutes or days; they use a variety ofapplications to handle different aspects of the design process.andP;  They alsowant to reuse their work and share it with others, possibly customers orsubcontractors.andM;Companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and the various chip-makers areon virtually all the companies' customer lists, as are vendors of thesoftware tools they use.andP;  Few design-tool vendors have yet standardized on asingle OODB, but exceptions include Valid for Objectivity/DB, AssociativeDesign Technology for Ontos and InterACT/Advanced Computer Techniques forGemStone/Servio.andP;  Index, as noted below, is using Ontos for its forthcomingrepository.andP;  Fluent Machines, founded by Apollo founder Dave Nelson, is alsousing Ontos in its new OS/2-based multi-media development and deliveryplatform.andP;  Dave Parkhill, who leads a research team at US west, says he'susing object-oriented software and ObjectStore in order to reduce prototypingcosts and shorten time to market, but it may also be the foundation ofproduction systems for commercial billing systems and network management aswell as design.andP;  Many customers are still in the exploration or thenot-ready-to-announce stage; Servio is working closely with a financialinstitution and an airline, but can't persuade them to reveal theiridentities.andM;In a typical design scenario where an object-oriented database could help,transistors are connected to circuits with specified behaviors and electricalproperties which must correspond.andP;  Assemblies of these elements are combinedto form larger components, and so on until you have an entire chip withhundreds of thousands or millions of discrete parts.andP;  These chips then worktogether to form an entire subassembly, which will ultimately connect toothers to make a complete system.andM;Index: The repository knowsandM;Index Technology is in the throes of building the next generation ofExcelerator CASE tool on top of Ontos.andP;  It will manage all the information  -specifications, diagrams, source and object code, documentation, and all theversions thereof  - that developers work with.andP;  (The executable code modulesthemselves need not be object-oriented and will generally be stored in filesresident in and compiled for a particular environment.) The Index project isprogressing somewhat more slowly than expected, but more because of the CASEand OS/2 aspects than because of Ontos.andP;  An OS/2, c-tree version will be outin a few months, says Index's vp software development Jerry Katzke, but theversion built on Ontos will take another year or so.andP;  Why wait? &quot;Ontos givesus a more robust data model; now we have to build the data model on top[rather than let the database manage it].andP;  And with Ontos we can put rules inaround the data as part of the system, rather than as external constraintsyou can bypass.andP;  Finally, Ontos will make it a lot easier to supportversioning and configuration management and workgroup computing.&quot; (All thesebenefits would be true of any object-oriented database system.)andM;CASE repositories such as Index's aren't just for development projects;they're where you manage reference copies of software permanently.andP;  Copiescan be used for execution, but this is where you go for modules when you wantto do something new; to maintain integrity when you change something; to finda data definition to reuse; to coordinate when you're building a system tointeract with another department.andP;  The repository knows who is using whatversions of what software.andP;  And, because it's an OODB (not a real-timerelational db with instantaneous two-phase commit), it can be made to handlethe ambiguities of real life: Not all the information is on-line; some unitsget out of touch and must be re-synchronized on a periodic basis.andP;  The OODBknows what has changed and what hasn't, where reconciliation can be automaticand where a human has to come in to resolve conflicts.andP;  (Note that the OODBitself doesn't resolve conflicts; it just keeps track of them, and rules orembedded processes in the database take care of the semantics.)andM;In a better publicized project, IBM and its cohorts are working on the IBMRepository, a DB2-based database extended and front-ended to handle objectswhich will compete or interact with truly object-oriented systems from suchvendors as Index Technology.andP;  We suspect that at some point it will becomeclear that OODB would have been the way to go.andM;Beyond  WKS and WK1andM;Lotus is looking at a number of object-oriented databases in a projectmanaged by Toby Bloom (who formerly worked on the Index project) under theguidance of chief scientist David Reed.andP;  The goal is not a new foundation forNotes, which already has its own rich database,[3] nor any change indirection of the company's relational database efforts, but rather a way tomanage the complex data in spreadsheets and graphics now stored as files.andO;Files don't provide the necessary granularity or representation ofdependencies.andP;  For example, you may want to maintain multiple versions of aspreadsheet where only a few cells and formulas differ from version toversion, or consolidations that consist of a number of linked spreadsheetswith different data for different regions or products (cf.andP;  Lotus's Improvfor NEXT).andP;  In other words, the objects could be cells or collections ofcells (cf.andP;  named ranges) or formulas or macros, not whole files as in, say,NewWave.andP;  We want all of the benefits of database  - reliability, sharing,integrity, transaction management - without the abstractness of SQL,&quot; saysBloom.andP;  'We want to be able to associate procedures [formulas] withsmall-grained items of information.andP;  And we want to be able to share themacross different versions of our own [application] software.&quot; (For an exampleof an environment with similar ideas, see the discussion of Patriot Partners,page 17.)andM;For now, object-oriented databases are hard to understand, hard to benchmark(because performance and needs are so application-specific) and hard...andP;  lyfinished.andP;  Buyers will be limited to astute people who understand both theirown problems and how OODBs could solve them, and who feel comfortable withthe technology.andM;Updated data on instances of the class OODBandM;To use objectspeak, the general class of object-oriented databases isbeginning to specialize itself into subclasses which inherit some commoncharacteristics but also differ in a variety of ways.andP;  It's difficult tocompare and contrast these systems, since their vendors generally considerthem optimized for all tasks except possibly OLTP.andP;  (We described them allfrom a technical perspective a year ago; see Release 1.0, 89-9.) Most are nowshipping, but not all have the courage to call their products finished;Versant and Object Design are selling &quot;revenue-beta&quot; versions.andM;[3] However, it's not object-oriented, because it doesn't (easily) allow forthe creation of new classes, nor does it support object hierarchies ingeneral.andP;  However, You could easily put its information into anobject-oriented database.andP;  That wouldn't give You automatic interoperabilitybetween Notes and, say, most wp or data formats, but it would make it easierto handle the process of conversion automatically once you had written theconversion routines.andP;  n other words, it could make managing the integrationof Notes with other systems easier for programmers, and virtually invisibleto end-users.andM;The basic difference seems to be between the Smalltalk/LISP/runtime-binding/interpreted camp and the C++/UNIX camp.andP;  These are broad distinctions andgeneralizations, but they divide the world into Servio, Statice and Itasca onthe one hand, and the 0 brothers  - Object Design, Objectivity, Ontologic andAltair (with 02)  - on the other.andP;  Versant, a special case with a strongrelational flavor, and Servio, with its new C++ interface, put themselves inboth camps.andM;The first group are truly object-oriented, they will tell you, and storetheir methods right with their objects.andP;  The methods get interpreted at eachclient where they are executed, making for maximum portability (if notperformance).andP;  Except for Versant, which has a heavy relational culture,these vendors sell to people who may be less concerned with performance andruntime execution than with ease of prototyping and flexibility.andM;The C++ crowd generally store their heavy-duty code on a particular targetmachine/environment, where it is compiled for that environment and can runfaster.andP;  That means faster performance in execution, but slower performancein modifications (because the changes need to be compiled).andM;The distinction is much like that between interpreted languages and C/C++ ingeneral.andP;  Again the question is, Are you spending more time designing thecomponents, or managing the assembly and interaction of components someonehas already designed? That's a fine distinction, and partly just a questionof levels of abstraction and granularity.andP;  Someone designing circuit diagramsor mechanical systems is probably manipulating objects or putting data intothem without modifying the code of individual ones as much, whereas someoneusing an object-oriented system to design a prototype is probably writing andadding a lot of new code/objects.andP;  The first person would go with C++, whilethe second might go with Smalltalk.andP;  Likewise, office automation orpublishing applications could go either way, depending on whether you'reproducing multiple documents or designing new ones  - publishing periodicalswith standard formats and varying content, vs.andP;  designing new documentationsystems or changing the layout rules for each customer in a job-shop printinghouse.andM;In the end, customers have to decide what's important to them and make theirown choices.andP;  Within either category, there are finer issues, such as howmuch flexibility you get vs.andP;  how much designers or programmers need to knowabout system innards, speed of access vs.andP;  speed of updating (cf.andP;  query vs.andO;transaction performance in a relational database).andM;Object Design  - A kinder, gentler oracleandM;On the East Coast, Object Design is winning new business and quickly turninginto the Oracle of the group, with aggressive marketing and two salespeople(of four) from Oracle, led by ceo Ken Marshall, who ran Oracle East Coastoperations.andP;  We want to be a kinder, gentler Oracle,&quot; says founder andchairman Tom Atwood, who earlier directed much of Ontologic's effort.andP;  ObjectDesign seems to be catching up fast in visibility if not in numbers toOntologic, which has an early lead and a 150-strong customer base.andP;  ObjectDesign now has about 20 customers, all in beta, for about 100 individualusers overall.andP;  They include installations at Microsoft, Lotus (page 10), NECand Olivetti.andP;  US West and Martin Marietta are using ODI's Object-Store forseveral projects, including network management (more a logistics andconfiguration management application than real-time switching).andP;  Object-Storecosts $9000 or less per seat, and is scheduled commercial release next month.andO;Already, customers' enthusiasm, among other things, has helped the companywin a second round of financing from Vista, Harvard Ventures and NEA, as wellas Kodak, Olivetti, Philips and Orien (representing several Japanesemanufacturers), for $9 million in total.andM;The company's ObjectStore gets good marks from Lotus's Bloom and SouthwesternBell's Todd Bashuk among others.andP;  It has a virtual-memory analogue for datathat traps hardware faults generated by accesses to stored objects (ratherthan using software to check whether an object is persistent, as most of theothers do).andP;  This works fine as long as long as you're on the Sun, thecurrent platform, but hasn't been shipped for other systems yet.andP;  Performanceis superior as long as most of the objects are in memory (as with virtualmemory for code), but it suffers when a lot of disk swapping is required  -as it does with any database, object-oriented or not.andM;So far, customers don't seem to find that a problem, even with more than300,000 (small) objects or, says Kodak's Bob Gordon, 50-megabyte objects(images).andP;  However, ObjectStore provides limited flexibility in options forconcurrency and short transaction control, with few options for granularityof locking or timing, but it has extensive support for long transactions andversion control.andM;For better or worse, ObjectStore offers the most seamless environment, withtight links between the database and its version of C++.andP;  Although ObjectDesign supports the usual standards  - UNIX, C++, Motif  - and graphicaltools, the company sees itself as a leader in object-oriented technologyitself; its optional seamless C++ is either proprietary or uniquely enhanced,depending on your point of view.andM;ODI also has the distinction of having licensed its parameterized typetechnology to ATandamp;T for use in a future release of C++.andP;  Parameterized typesbring more object-orientation to C++ than it had before, make developmentfaster and easier, and fulfill a specification of he ANSI C++ standard.andP;  Inbrief, you can create a class such as a generic set and let the system dealwith it as a set, and only later create a specific instance that holds boats,and then it binds in the boat-specific methods.andM;Ontologic  - Mature and full-featuredandM;By comparison, Ontologic's Ontos allows for great flexibility in locking byobjects and transactions ...andP;  but a lot more complexity.andP;  The choices you getto make, you gotta make.andP;  Overall, Ontos is the most mature of the C++products; it has more tools than any system except GemStone, and it is theonly one yet to run on OS/2.andP;  Along with the second release of Ontos,Ontologic recently announced Shorthand, an object-oriented 4GL (easy-to-useapplication language) for non-C++ users (which generates C++, obviating thenon-portability arguments against most 4GLs), and a graphical screengenerator.andP;  Whereas Objectivity sells mostly to OEMs and true techies,Ontologic and Servio seem best-equipped to sell direct to users (though eventhese are programmers rather than your typical power PC user).andM;Ontologic's customers include General Dynamics, British Telecom, NTT, BritishAerospace, Motorola (for a manufacturing application) and Xerox (a researchgroup in Rochester).andP;  On the strength of its recent success in garneringcustomers, the company recently raised another $4.3 million from itsinvestors, which include Kleiner Perkins, Wolfenson, Smith Barney andPhoenix, as well as Patricof, a new investor.andM;Objectivity  - Object machoandM;Objectivity has garnered attention for its deal with DEC, as well asagreements with Sony and Valid Logic Systems [4].andP;  Shipments began lastApril.andP;  Development systems cost $30,000; runtime systems, quantity discountsand OEM licenses are available.andP;  Objectivity/DB runs on Sun 3s and 4s andDECstations under UNIX, with VMS and VAXstations on the way and others tofollow.andP;  The system is designed to be fully distributed, with databases andclients anywhere on a multi-vendor network.andP;  It has a multi-level cache, anduser-settable options for granularity of concurrency and transaction control.andM;Funded by Mayfield, Institutional Venture and Menlo Ventures, Objectivity isfocusing on the engineering and scientific market, says president Bob Field.andO;He is a former venture capitalist and sales manager at four successfulstart-ups; most of the other employees come from electronics or computerfirms.andP;  Objectivity/DB comes with application notes and sample structures andcode for an EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) circuit model andnetlister, a PDES (Product Data Exchange Specification) geometrical andtopological 3D model, and a software configuration manager.andP;  The deal withDEC will help it reach other markets such as office automation, manufacturingand finance without diverting its own resources and attention.andM;More than anything, the company is focused on  a back-end database, for fullsize, full performance and full reliability,&quot; says co-founder Drew Wade,formerly with Daisy and HP.andM;Altair  - Objets de FranceandM;Paris-based Altair is a government-assisted consortium (50 percent) withinvestments from Siemens (34), Bull (10) and a university  -  25 millionaltogether).andP;  It is coming along on schedule with 02, a C- and UNIX-orientedobject-oriented database.andP;  It manages storage by pages, reducing granularitybut increasing performance from the earlier object-based scheme.andP;  The projectwill go commercial and independent next year, with minority shares from Bulland Siemens and a large part of ownership in the hands of founder FrancoisBancilhon and other employees.andP;  Altair plans a beta release late this year toten customers, nine in France and one in the US.andP;  The system will start atabout $30,000 per seat, with discounts for multiple copies.andP;  The targetmarket is mostly technical applications, but, says Bancilhon,  We spent atleast a third of our effort on Motif-based programming tools with graphical,active, editable objects on the screen.&quot;andM;[4] Valid will use objectivity/DB as the foundation of its Design Manager, anetworked back-end both for Valid's own suite of electronics design tools andfor others its customers use, says senior product marketing manager LarryRice.andP;  Like many companies in this consolidating business, Valid hascollected several different tools through acquisitions, and needs a way toget them to work together.andP;  However, Design Manager initially will be more away to manage users' work in the large than to manipulate the contents of thework.andP;  That is, it will manage a user's work, and the relationship, say,between a spec and the implementation, rather than the individual componentshe's designing.andP;  It should be available early next year.andM;Servio  - Joining the mainstreamandM;Servio's GemStone has been shipping the longest of all these systems, sinceandM;January 1988, and is now in its full-fledged release 2.0, including a new C++interface, hooks to Sybase's SQL Server, and support for a broad range ofplatforms working together simultaneously including workstations and serversfrom IBM, DEC and Sun, and Mac and PC clients.andP;  It is written in C, and willshortly have a range of graphical tools in addition to Release 2.0'sgraphical schema designer.andM;The company has 130 customers, including IBM, Nippon Steel, US West, MartinMarietta, JPL, Lockheed, Kodak and British Petroleum, for applicationsranging from CAD/CAM to medical information systems, office automation andcartography.andP;  While performance has increased four times, the company says,the pricing has dropped.andP;  It starts at $20,000 for a four-user license.andO;Overall, Servio approaches Ontologic for the largest installed base.andP;  Thecompany has a strong offering, and the current version, with support not justfor C, C++ and Smalltalk but for applications in COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada and LISPthrough RPCs, overcomes the company's traditional Smalltalk flavor which putoff a number of commercial accounts.andP;  Not only does it support both, but youcan access the same database from Smalltalk and C++.andP;  Over time, the companyhas dramatically improved performance and debugged the system, to the pointthat it's now robust enough to be used in production applications at Evans andamp;Sutherland, which is using it for daily, live management of parts libraries.andM;Aside from technical issues, the company, privately owned by an Indonesiancorporation, has recently made a number of moves towards the everyday world,including the installation a year ago of president and ceo Donal O'Shea, whowas previously president of UniSoft and vp operations of the Open SoftwareFoundation.andP;  New marketing vp Carole Rutter worked at IBM for 24 years; PaulButterworth, chief scientist at Ingres, is joining Servio this month.andM;Itasca  - Orion rebornandM;Itasca, renamed from Artemis and derived from MCC's Orion, has been shippingbeta versions of its Itasca OODB since  January, and production versionssince July.andP;  The system is optimized for multi-user, distributed use, withthe schema replicated at every workstation, data stored across the system inlocations optimized by the system (by default; the designer can also specifywhere things should go), and a combination of private and shared databases tominimize concurrency problems.andP;  It runs on Apollo, HP, Silicon Graphics orSun workstations, but not yet on mixed networks.andP;  It supports a C interfaceplus its own database language, and will have a Motif-based GUI soon.andP;  It haspessimistic locking at the object level (vs.andP;  pages for most competitors whofocus on performance), which maximizes integrity and minimizes unnecessaryconflicts because of the fine granularity of object-locking.andM;Overall, Itasca is elegant at handling complex object relationships andprototyping.andP;  Customers who have been using it  are enthusiastic, but a lotof people dismiss it because of its provenance in the LISP world of MCC  -thevery background that gives it its elegance and flexibility.andP;  Itasca's 15customers so far are mostly government outfits or internal projects atcommercial companies, including Allied Signal (3D models), automakers andaerospace companies.andP;  We have competed in almost every account,&quot; says Itascavp Bill Hoffman.andP;  For now, we're piggy-backing, since the incremental cost totry us too is so low&quot; at $3995 per server.andP;  Says one customer, proving thepoint,  For $2000 it's worth looking at if only for the intellectualexperience.&quot; (This customer gets a discount as an MCC member.)andM;Symbolics  - Statice quoandM;Statice is one of Symbolics, stronger products right now, but the companylacks the resources to market it as aggressively as it deserves.andP;  Still,installations are up to 85 from 70 last year.andP;  Symbolics plans to use Staticeas the basis of an interactive scheduling/planning business modeled on thesuccessful Houston Power andamp; Light installation (see Release 1.0, 89-9).andM;Versant  - Relational heritage, object-oriented nurtureandM;Versant Object Technology, formerly Object-Sciences, is the least visible ofthe recent crop of start-ups.andP;  It has been shipping Versant ODBMS and relatedtools since June; the product costs about $15,000 on a variety of Sunworkstations and the IBM RS/6000.andP;  The system is highly modular, with anunderlying object-oriented data storage component, Versant ODBMS, and alogical layer, Versant Star, that implements the database capabilities -transactions, versioning, schema representation, distributed data access andamp;query and updates (but not to RDBs and OODBs in a single transaction).andO;Versant Star acts as the insulating data schema manager between any kind ofapplication system/language on the top and any kind of storage manager on thebottom (although it's assumed to be Versant ODBMS if it's object-oriented).andO;&quot;Post-beta&quot; deliveries will start in early 1991, with support forSmalltalk-80 and Oracle and the Versant ODBMS through Versant Star.andM;President Mike Seashols says the company is ahead of plan, with $1.5 millionin revenues so far, and has done better than expected in the MIS/OA world.andO;At OOPSLA next month it will announce agreements with both a hardware vendor(as a reseller) and a large MIS customer (one of the top 20), he adds.andP;  Thisis a good sign for OODBs in general, since most people figured MIS interestwouldn't kick in until later.andP;  Certainly Versant is the best equipped to sellinto this market in philosophy and in personnel, many of whom havebackgrounds with Oracle and Ingres.andP;  Funding of more than $8 million comesfrom TA Associates, Bessemer Venture, Advent and Singapore Technology.andM;Overall, the company is a big believer in coexistence.andP;  Says Seashols, whoran sales and marketing for both Oracle and Ingres, &quot;I was a relational guyand now I want to play in the object world and keep the benefits I gotaccustomed to with relational.andP;  We've gone a little bit higher in the foodchain [than competitors], beyond design to production as a whole.andP;  It's ourbackground; we came from selling to vps of MIS.andP;  I'd always been concernedabout how fast that market would mature, but now it's coming along fasterthan I hoped.andP;  Manufacturing is about half the world, so we're looking atconcurrent engineering, integrated manufacturing.andP;  The federal government'sinvolvement in CALS is rippling through the manufacturing community.&quot;andM;And on the defending side...andM;Oracle is still assessing the issues, says Beech.andP;  The company hasn'tannounced anything yet, but we expect it will in due course.andP;  It's not reallythe role of standards groups to implement things,&quot; says Beech, &quot;so it seemsto be the socially responsible thing [for commercial vendors] to participatein this as soon as you have something sound rather than go too far down theroad.andP;  This is a real chance for convergence.andP;  We're ready to move ahead nowand put in a little richness while still keeping control.&quot;andM;Ingres has been taking the lead in the offensive defense, although things maychange with its acquisition by ASK and indirectly HP.andP;  The company wasco-founded ten years ago by Berkeley professor Michael Stonebraker.andO;Stonebraker is a co-author of  The Third-Generation Database Manifesto,&quot;along with Oracle's David Beech (who formerly worked on HP's Iris), in whichthey argue for saving the best of relational databases and extending themwith support for objects.andP;  Ingres 6.3 (the current version) can handleobjects and allows user-defined functions, but it's a long way from beingobject-oriented.andP;  We'll become objectized before OODBs becomeproductionized,&quot; asserts Ingres product manager David Kellogg.andM;Sybase, like Versant, offers an interface to almost anything with its OpenClient/Server architecture (page 19), and could easily front-end an OODB.andO;But unlike Versant, Sybase comes to the party with an established RDBbusiness (although it lacks an object-oriented storage manager).andM;Hewlett-Packard, which now owns part of Ingres/ASK, is also making plans for1991 to deliver a commercial implementation of Iris, its object-orienteddatabase project.andP;  The system uses the same underlying storage manager asRP's Allbase/SQL relational database and will be extended relational with anSQL interface and support for NewWave, says project manager David Wertheim.andM;Open Objects: The dairy councilsandM;There are three major standards groups with active OODB efforts: the ObjectManagement Group, the CAD Framework Initiative, and ANSI, with task groups onC++ and OODBs.andP;  In short, all the companies are active in most of theseefforts.andP;  The details: Object Design, Objectivity, Ontologic, Servio andVersant are all members of the Object Management Group.andP;  (All exceptOntologic are also members of the Open Software Foundation.) Servio's CaroleRutter is on the board of OMG, and its David Taylor and Jacob Stein areactive in subcommittees; Object Design is hosting the next OMG meetingdevoted to OODBS.andP;  The CAD Framework Initiative is a group of vendors andusers devoted to interoperability among design-automation tools; membersactive on its Storage Management subcommittee include Objectivity co-founderand technical wizard Drew Wade, who is chairman, as well as Versant,Ontologic and Object Design.andP;  Its other members include ATandamp;T, Cadence,Computervision, DEC, GM, H-P, IBM, Mentor Graphics, Sony, Sun, TexasInstruments, and Valid.andP;  Ontologic's Tim Andrews chairs the ANSI X3 committeeon OODBs, where Object Design, Servio, Versant and Objectivity are alsoactive, and Object Design is particularly involved in ANSI's C++ work,including ODI's implementation of its draft standard for parameterized types.andO;Itasca is currently using MCC's membership in OMG and CFI, but will join onits own shortly.andM;For example: Fold me in your database of applicantsandM;How would an OODB work as a foundation for office automation? There are lotsof answers depending on the specific tasks involved, so let's consider oneexample: a job-applicant-processing system.andP;  The basic object is simply thefolder  - just one step away from the file metaphor.andP;  A folder typicallyincludes a certain amount of table-style data: name andamp; address, phone numbers,dates, qualifications, previous jobs, previous employers, etc.andP;  But thefolder may also include a vide variety of supporting items  - the text of theresume, an image of the resume and perhaps the candidate's photo or a newsclipping, notes from interviews with the candidate or references, supportingletters, phone-call memos, voice notes, test results, and appointment timesand deadlines related to the selection/ hiring process.andP;  Some of thisinformation may  belong&quot; to a particular recruiter working with thecandidate, but other workers in the group may need or want access to some ofit.andP;  The folder or selected contents can be sent around the office or outsideit; its route might be preset and monitored, or the activity could be more adhoc.andP;  (We will discuss these ideas at length next month in our issue ongroupware development tools.) Items within the folder could also havebehavior, or methods: How to display themselves, how and where to sendthemselves, when to send a follow-up request for information, and so forth.andM;For example, when Juan hires Alice, the accept-candidate method triggers anumber of actions: A letter is sent to Alice, with information such asAlice's name and address and start date selected from the folder.andP;  Otherinformation comes from other sources: The letter itself comprises text from asub-database of document objects  - paragraphs about the department Alice isjoining, about the product she'll be selling and about the glorious historyof the company itself.andP;  The job description comes from a listing of jobrequisitions  - another kind of folder, with a collection of jobs thatcontain both structured data such as salaries and departments and job titles,and less structured information such as requirements and duties.andM;A notification is also sent to the employee newsletter, including a scannedimage of Alice's photograph, and to the personnel department if Juan made thedecision all by himself, or to Juan if the application is run by thepersonnel department.andP;  Another message might be sent to the payrolldepartment, either to a person or direct to the payroll application, withproper authorization.andP;  The company phone directory (kept online, of course)would also be updated.andP;  In a really automated company, another message mightgenerate purchase orders for new computer equipment and software for Aliceunless she is replacing someone, and create a new node for her on thedepartment LAN.andM;To each part of the system, Alice-as-object has different characteristics: Toone, she is the recipient of a letter, to another she is a computer-user, toyet another she is an employee record.andP;  The OODB maintains the  Alice object&quot;and delivers it and related objects properly for each user/application.andO;While it appears as an object within the object-oriented database and theobject-oriented applications built around it, it may also be a record in anumber of relational databases updated by the OODB.andP;  It's a heterogeneousworld.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
