For the accelerating structure of the tandem booster which oughtto accelerate heavy ions of wide range of mass numbers, quarter waveresonator (QWR)s are suitable because of their wide ion-velocity acceptance.Ions of hydrogen to bismuth from the JAERI tandem can be acceleratedby {beta} = 0.1 QWRs. The excellent result of a niobium QWR at ArgonneNational Laboratory was a motive for the development of niobium QWRs.Further considerations on the design were required, because the Argonne'sQWR did not have beam ports nor frequency tuners. As a result of considerationson these points, it has been decided to have an oval cylinder for theouter conductor. The prototype resonator has been built and tested. Thefabrication techniques of explosive bonding, electron beam welding andheat treatment were found to be available in domestic companies in 1984.After obtaining niobium and niobium-clad-copper materials in 1985, theprototype resonator was built in 1985-86. Electro-polishing was donein their laboratory. Tests at 4.2 K have been repeated several timesin combination of treatments of the niobium surface. The work is proceedingto the construction of a buncher and a prototype linac unit which arecomposed of superconducting QWRs. 4 references, 4 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
