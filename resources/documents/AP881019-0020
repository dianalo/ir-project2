The arms shipments ``are down in dollar value and tonnage,'' DanHoward, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said Tuesday.   ``Apparently, it's a move from the supplying of heavy equipment_ everything from bulldozers to tanks to artillery _ to providingthem more sustainability, like ammunition supplies. You can drawyour own conclusions about what that is about.   ``But we don't necessarily conclude that this means the Sovietsare backing off from their support for Nicaragua. Certainly, thewar-fighting capability (of Nicaragua) has not gone down.''   During the first nine months of the year, the Soviets and theirWarsaw Pact allies shipped 13,000 metric tons _ or about 14,300regular tons _ of military equipment to Nicaragua, according to thelatest Defense Department estimate.   By comparison, shipments of Soviet equipment during calendar1987 arrived at an average rate of 1,808 metric tons per month _ or16,272 metric tons for the first nine months of 1987. Thattranslates to 17,899 regular tons.   The drop in tonnage in 1988 also is reflected by intelligenceestimates of the dollar value of the arms received.   The Pentagon estimated the materiel delivered during the firstnine months of this year was worth $350 million. Shipments in 1987were worth about $42 million a month _ or about $378 million fornine months.   During all of 1987, the Nicaraguans received 21,700 metric tonsof arms valued at $505 million, the Defense Department estimates.   Despite evidence of an arms slowdown, Howard said Nicaragua wasstill maintaining the largest military force in the region and thatthanks to previous arms deliveries, ``they're extraordinarily wellarmed ... (and) constitute a threat to their neighbors.''   The slowdown in deliveries to the Sandinistas comes at a timewhen American military aid to the Contra guerrillas has been cutoff completely for eight months. The Reagan administration, undercongressional pressure, ended its military assistance to the rebelsat the end of February, three weeks before a truce and cease-firetook effect.   The truce has failed to produce a permanent peace, andskirmishes are still being reported between Sandinista forces andthe rebels. Absent a major Sandinista offensive, however, PresidentReagan announced last week he would not attempt to wincongressional approval for more lethal aid.   Until this year, Soviet arms shipments to the Sandinistas haveclimbed steadily, rising from only about 1.6 metric tons in 1980 toa record 22,000 metric tons in 1986 and last year's near-record21,700 metric tons.</TEXT></DOC>
