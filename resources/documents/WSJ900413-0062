The green light came from a federal appeals court here,which reversed a lower court's extension of the ban on Bellownership of electronic directory services, sports scores,stock quotes and other information that might one day betransmitted over telephone networks.</LP><TEXT>   The appeals court told the lower court to rethink thedecision using a more lenient legal standard.   The regional Bells' shares initially jumped more than $1on the news, as Wall Street contemplated the potential of thegiant, unfettered Bells thundering into the informationservices market. After all, the Bell regional phone companieshave spent six years fighting in the courts and in Congressto end the restrictions on information services,manufacturing and long-distance service that were imposedunder the consent decree breaking up the Bell System.   But now reality is setting in, and many analysts areconcluding that the Bells' payoff from the electronicinformation age isn't just around the corner.   The Bells &quot;could become reasonably powerful in electronicyellow pages,&quot; says Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. Butit will take a while. And he believes the lower court, inunleashing the Bells, will probably take pains to &quot;ensurethat the Bells have absolutely no advantage over independentdata providers.&quot;   Bell companies' stocks have been buoyed of late by thestrong promise of their cellular mobile-telephone businesses,as well as by regulatory breaks and cost-cutting. Theirstocks generally trade at multiples of earnings that match orexceed the overall stock market.   Ameritech and U S West both trade at 13 times the pastyear's per-share earnings. BellSouth, Pacific Telesis andSouthwestern Bell have multiples of 15 to 16; Bell Atlantic,17, and Nynex 20 (last year's Nynex profit included heavyone-time charges.)   Most residential telephone customers don't currently owncomputer terminals to call up fancy information services.Punching buttons on a phone keypad isn't the easiest way toextract certain types of data. And it's unclear exactly whatthe Bells might try to sell that isn't already available,sometimes for free.   To be sure, all seven will benefit once they can offerelectronic yellow pages. Some Bells are trying to positionthemselves better than their siblings to bolt when thejudiciary or Congress opens the gate.   &quot;Bell Atlantic has been very aggressive on the classservices side (Caller I.D., Call Forwarding, Call Trace andthe like), and BellSouth has a lot of advanced technology inits network, so it's more leading-edge,&quot; says Jack B. Grubmanof Paine Webber.   &quot;Some have shown a proclivity to be more venturesome,&quot;says Greg Sawers at Sanford Bernstein. He rates BellSouth andSouthwestern Bell the most aggressive, although Southwesternrecently ended its yearlong videotex &quot;gateway&quot; tests inHouston. (Through a gateway, customers with computerterminals can reach a wide range of information providers.) US West, which is providing low-cost computer terminals withits gateway in Omaha, could be in a relatively good position,too.   On the other hand, Mr. Sawers notes, Ameritech didn't evenattempt to test a videotex gateway, and Pacific Telesis,scanning the ruins of other electronic publishing ventures,canceled a gateway test just before its scheduled debut.   One part of the appeals court ruling hobbled the Bells byupholding a ban on their entry into long distance. So theBells won't be the ones pocketing the long-distance revenuewhen faraway customers dial up a central computer brimmingwith costly-to-gather information.   &quot;The real benefit of owning a data base and providing itto customers is to centralize,&quot; says Robert Morris III,telecommunications analyst for Goldman Sachs. &quot;Take theexample of California. Pacific Telesis would have to contractwith, say MCI Communications to carry calls between SanFrancisco and L.A.&quot;   For years, the Bells have complained that phone companiesin other countries such as France have been able to provideinformation services to their customers. The Bells contendthat because of their ban, the U.S. is slipping into asecond-rate telecommunications power.   What the Bell companies eventually want is clearance fromCongress to enter the cable television gold mine -- andpermission to own at least a portion of the programming.Revenue from video entertainment, they say, will allow themto build a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network.   If the French Minitel system is indeed the model the Bellsclaim it is, information services could be a mixed blessing.&quot;Minitel was a nice windfall for French businesses because itmade it easier to reach customers,&quot; says Mr. Morris ofGoldman Sachs. &quot;The phone company gave away all theseterminals, and the public is paying for them through higherrates. But one of the main things the general public usesMinitel for is pornography.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
