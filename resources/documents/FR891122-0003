This final rule is a product of thatprocess and an analysis of comments received from the credit union industry.The amendments to the rule are as follows:(1) Investments with remaining maturities in excess of 3 years are includedin the definition of risk assets, except for those identified as exclusions(2) The Allowance for Investment Losses is included with the Regular Reserve,and Allowance for Loan Losses when determining the minimum amount of grossincome to be transferred to the Regular Reserve.(3) Each Federal credit union board of directors is authorized to chargethe Regular Reserve for investment losses, without regional director approval,as long as the capital ratio is above 6 percent prior to the charge andthe amount of the charge reduces the ratio by no more than \1/2\ percent.Federally insured state-chartered credit unions are also authorized tocharge the statutory reserves for investment losses provided it meets thesame requirements described above for Federal credit unions, is permittedby state law or procedures established by the state regulatory authority,and notifies the appropriate NCUA regional director. Capital is definedas the total of the Regular Reserve, Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowancefor Investment Losses, other reserves and Undivided Earnings.(4) The maintenance of a valuation allowance account for loan and investmentlosses does not eliminate the requirement for transferring a percentageof gross income to the Regular Reserve account before the payment of eachdividend.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>National Credit Union Administration, 1776 G Street,NW., Washington, DC 20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>D.

This is the primary methodby which credit unions build capital. The statutory reserve requirementfor each credit union, as established by section 116, is 6 or 10 percentof risk assets depending on the size of the credit union and the lengthof time it has been in operation. Section 700.1(j) of the NCUA Rules andRegulations (12 CFR 700.1(j)) defines risk assets by listing those assetswhich are not included. Presently, the definition of risk assets is essentiallylimited to loans to members.The nature of credit union's balance sheet has changed dramatically sincethe reserve procedures (and risk asset definition) were established. Atthat time, member loans made up almost all of a credit union's assets andthus, the credit union made reserve transfers on what were essentiallytotal assets. At present, a significant part of most credit unions' balancesheets consists of assets excluded for the definition of risk assets andtherefore, excluded from those assets that determine minimum statutoryreserve goals. Events of recent years have shown, however, that substantiallosses can occur on these assets.Accordingly, the NCUA Board made the decision to review the issues involvingrisk assets and reserve requirements. The Board's objective was to ensureconsistency between credit union reserves against losses and the risk inherentin the present asset structure of credit unions. NCUA's first formal requestfor public comment on this issue in October 1987 (52 FR 38771, October19, 1987) elicited comments that made four general points:<ITAG tagnum="21">a. The definition of risk assets could be improved, particularly inthe area of long-term assets;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. No change should be made to the definition that would adverselyaffect credit unions;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Credit unions involved with riskier undertakings should be requiredto reserve at a higher rate; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The statute and regulation need improvement.</ITAG>A review of these comments indicated to the NCUA Board that the issue neededfurther review and in April 1988, the Board determined that a review shouldbe made of the statute, regulations and accounting procedures involvingreserves, risk assets and reserve transfers. The Board directed NCUA staffto work with the credit union industry to develop a systematic, cohesiveapproach to the broad issue of the capital position of credit unions.Immediately after this decision, a Credit Union Reserves Study Commissionwas formed by the credit union trade organizations. NCUA staff membersand state regulators participated in the work of the Commission on an advisorybasis. The Commission published its findings in February 1989 and madetwo major recommendations: First, that the credit union movement shouldseek legislative and regulatory changes to replace the current system ofrequired transfers to regular reserves with a system of required net capitalcontributions and second, that regulatory agencies consider several changesto strengthen the current required reserve transfer system.The Board then issued proposed regulatory amendments in May of 1989 (54FR 21961, May 22, 1989). A summary of the major aspects of the proposedrule follows.The proposed amendment added the following assets that will be includedin the definition of risk assets:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Fixed assets in excess of 5 percent of total shares and retainedearnings; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Investments with a remaining maturity in excess of 3 years unlessthey are carried at the lower of cost or market, or are marked to marketvalue monthly.</ITAG>In addition, the proposal includes the Allowance for Investment Losseswith the Allowance for Loan Losses and Regular Reserve in determining theminimum reserve transfer and stated that charges to the Regular Reservefor losses other than loan losses must be approved by the regional directorwhen certain conditions exist. When these same conditions exist, federallyinsured state-chartered credit unions can charge the Regular Reserve forlosses other than loan losses, but only after the appropriate NCUA regionaldirector has been notified. It was also proposed to add a provision thatthe maintenance of a valuation allowance for investments and other lossesdoes not eliminate the requirement for a reserve transfer before dividendscan be paid.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>Seventy-seven comments were received on the proposed amendments. Sixty-ninecomments were from federal and federally insured state-chartered creditunions. Ten comments were from credit union leagues and trade associations.Comments were also received from a federal agency, a national savings andloan trade organization, a law firm, and a broker. Two comments were fromindividuals.The comments were generally in favor of the proposed changes to the regulation.Four major changes recommended by the commenters were:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) That the credit union board of directors be authorized to chargethe regular reserve for investment losses;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) That the state supervisory authority be the approving entity inthe case of federally insured state-chartered credit unions requiring awaiver for the purpose of charging reserves;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) That fixed assets in excess of 5 percent not be included in thedefinition of risk assets; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) That special consideration be given to credit unions that experienceundue hardship caused by implementation of the new regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Final Rule and Changes</ITAG>Section 700.1(k) DefinitionsFixed AssetsThirty-eight comments were received on the proposal to include as a riskasset the ownership of fixed assets in excess of 5 percent of total sharesand retained earnings as defined by andSection; 701.36 of the NCUA Rulesand Regulations. Fourteen commenters approved of the proposal, while twenty-twocommenters objected in some degree. Sixteen commenters objected altogetherto the inclusion of fixed assets in excess of 5 percent, arguing that andSection;701.36 of the NCUA regulations already requires a credit union to obtainapproval of investments to be made in excess of 5 percent of total sharesand retained earnings. This allows NCUA to restrict a credit union frominvesting at a level of undue risk. The Board agrees, and accordingly,fixed assets in excess of 5 percent of total assets are not included inthe definition of risk assets in the final rule.InvestmentsFifty-six commenters addressed the inclusion in risk assets of investmentswith a remaining maturity over 3 years that are not carried at the lowerof cost or market, or are not marked to market on a monthly basis. Eightcommenters expressed approval of the proposed changes because the currentdefinition of risk assets does not accurately reflect the risk of long-term,non-loan assets. Nineteen commenters expressed total objection. Their reasonsvaried. Several commenters noted that the risks involved in long-term investmentswere interest rate related and that there was little or no risk to theprincipal value of the investment.Eight commenters recommended that the maturity on long-term investmentsto be included in the risk asset definition be extended to 5 years or more,arguing that an investment of 5 years poses no more risk than a 3-yearinvestment and that investments in the 10- to 30-year maturity range arewhere problems arise. Others stated that extending the maturity is desirablein order to avoid unnecessarily restricting capable credit unions withstrong capital positions.Eleven comments were received regarding the exclusion of investments thatare carried at the lower of cost or market, or those that are marked tomarket value monthly. Five commenters agreed, noting the risk associatedwith this type of investment is eliminated at the end of the accountingperiod by bringing the security to market value. Several commenters statedthat marking to market only recognized past loss and that to adequatelyreflect the risk of future loss, a reserve transfer based on the amountinvested was needed.The Board has decided to adopt its original proposal, i.e., to includeas risk assets, investments with remaining maturities greater than 3 yearsthat are not carried at the lower of cost or market or are not marked tomarket value monthly. The risks involved in investments with maturitiesgreater than 3 years are recognized as twofold. First, interest rate riskcan cause loss of income to a credit union when the instrument cannot berepriced. Second, market risk can cause the loss of principal value dueto market fluctuations or by the sale of the instrument. The maturity lengthat which an investment becomes most vulnerable is dependent upon the marketand the credit union's asset structure at any given point in time. Selectionof the 3-year cut off in the definition of a long-term investment willprovide for conservative reserving requirements.Other IssuesOne commenter noted that the proposed rule did not exempt investments inFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation securities with maturities of lessthan 3 years. Also, the deposit in the NCUSIF was not listed as being exemptfrom the definition of risk assets. These were oversights and have beencorrected in the final rule.Five comments were received on the inclusion of student loans in the definitionof risk assets. The commenters argued that student loans should not beincluded since they are guaranteed by the U.S. Government. The commentersfurther suggested that additional reserve requirements would adverselyaffect credit union involvement in the student loan program. Student loansmaturing in excess of 3 years will remain in the definition of risk assets.The risks associated with these loans are comparable to those of otherlong-term investments.Section 702.2 Regular ReserveTwenty-four comments were received regarding the proposal that credit unionsobtain regional director approval prior to charging the Regular Reservefor investment losses. Thirteen commenters expressed opposition to thisproposal. The commenters made two basic arguments. First, many believethat this provision infringes on the responsibilities of the credit union'sboard of directors. Second, because credit unions are adequately reservingfor loan losses and responsibly exercising their authority to charge-offthese losses without advance approval, they believe it is reasonable andprudent to allow credit unions to charge off investment losses in the samemanner.Six commenters specifically mentioned that in the case of federally insuredstate-chartered credit unions approval to charge off investments shouldcome from the state regulator and not the regional director. Commentersexpressed concern that the proposed rule does not take into account thedifferent definitions of risk assets and permissible investments allowedby the various states. Other commenters stated that requiring the NCUA'sregional director's approval for federally insured state-chartered creditunions infringes upon states' rights and is detrimental to the dual charteringsystem.After review of these comments, the final rule has been revised in twoaspects: First, the regional directors approval is not required on allinvestment losses charged to the Regular Reserve. Instead, a capital reductionlimit and a minimum capital level are established for the purpose of determiningprior approval from the regional director. Specfically, the credit union'sboard of directors will be authorized to charge investment losses withoutprior regional director approval if the credit union's capital ratio isabove 6 percent and the charge will reduce the ratio by no more than \1/2\percent, and the board of directors authorization states the amount, causeand need for the charge. Second, the state supervisory authority will,if required by law or established procedures, make the final decision onthose state-chartered credit unions requiring prior approval. The creditunion will be required, however, to notify the appropriate regional directorprior to the charge being made. The requirements and procedures for federallyinsured state-chartered credit unions are stated in andSection; 741.7.Seven commenters addressed the proposal that the Allowance for InvestmentLosses be included with the Allowance for Loan Losses and Regular Reservein determining the applicable percentage of gross income to be transferredto the Regular Reserve. Four commenters were in favor of the proposal.Three commenters expressed disagreement with the proposal. In addition,several commenters requested clarification concerning the accounting forthe Allowance for Investment Losses. The Allowance for Investment Losseswill be funded through the Provision for Investment Loss expense accountwhich is in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.Section 702.3 Full and Fair DisclosureFive commenters expressed an opinion on the addition to the full and fairdisclosure section providing that the maintenance of a valuation allowancefor investments and other losses does not eliminate the requirement fortransferring a percentage of gross income before the payment of each dividend.Two commenters support the provision as proposed. Three commenters disagreewith this provision, stating that the current regulation is adequate.To provide for consistency within the reserving requirements and to clarifythe inclusion of the Allowance for Investment Losses in the calculationof the total Regular Reserve, andSection; 702.3(c)(1) has been revised toprovide that the maintenance of the valuation allowance for loan lossesand investment and other losses does not eliminate the requirement fortransferring a percentage of gross income before the payment of each dividendto the Regular Reserve as required by section 116 of the Federal CreditUnion Act.Special ConsiderationsThere were many comments made that recommended that special considerationbe given to those credit unions who will be severely affected by thesenew reserving requirements. Special consideration will be given on a case-by-casebasis by formal appeal to the appropriate regional director. The appealingcredit union should provide a letter requesting special consideration,along with supporting documentation to justify the request.Calculation for Reserve Transfer RequirementsTo determine what the credit union's total statutory reserves are, thefollowing calculation will be required:ADD: The balances in the Regular Reserve, the Allowance for Loan Losses,and the Allowance for Investment Losses accounts together to determine``Total Regular Reserves''.Refer to section 116 of the Federal Credit Union Act for the percentageof risk assets applicable to your credit union. The Accounting Manual forFederal Credit Unions provides examples of the calculation of the amountof gross income to be transferred to the Regular Reserve.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certified that the final rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small creditunions (primarily those under $1 million in asssets). Accordingly the NCUABoard has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule makes no additional collection requirements; therefore, it neednot be sent to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.Executive Order 12612The NCUA Board has considered the fact that this final rule will affectfederally insured state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) in the determinationof transfers to reserves. It does not impose any additional cost or burdenon the states, nor does it affect the states' ability to discharge traditionalstate government functions. The benefits provided and protection affordedby the NCUSIF are the same for FISCUs as for Federal credit unions. Itis protection afforded through a federal system and the responsibilityfor administering that system lies with the NCUA Board. All federally insuredcredit unions should be subject to the same minimum reserve requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>12 CFR Part 700Credit unions; Risk assets; Reserve requirements12 CFR Part 702Credit unions; Regular Reserve charges; Full and fair disclosure12 CFR Part 741Credit unions; Reserve requirements<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on November 13,1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 700_DEFINITIONS</ITAG>1.
