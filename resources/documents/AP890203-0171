She said military assault rifles like the one used in aCalifornia rampage that left five children dead should be outlawed.   In an interview with The Associated Press, the first lady saidshe did not want to discuss the ``politics and policies''surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, President Bush, opposesnew federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member of theNational Rifle Association.   ``I myself do not own a gun,'' she said, urging an interviewer totalk with her husband about his position on handguns. ``I choose notto get into that. I am afraid of them (guns). I'm too afraid I'dshoot the wrong person.''   Nancy Reagan, before moving to Washington eight years ago,revealed she had owned ``a tiny little gun'' that she kept by herbed for protection while husband was away. In her first White Houseinterview in 1981, Mrs. Reagan said she had gotten rid of the weapon.   Marking the end of her second week in the White House, Mrs. Bushspent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since herhusband became president. ``I feel at home here,'' she said, sittingon a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her.   In a town torn by debate over a 51 percent pay increase formembers of Congress, Mrs. Bush was asked if she had been able tolive on her husband's salary when he was a House member from Houstonin the 1960s. ``No,'' she replied, saying that they had relied onmoney he earned as an oilman in Texas.   ``Could we have lived on it? We probably could have,'' she said.However, she said, they would have had a very different lifestyleand would not have been able to maintain two homes or send theirchildren to private schools.   Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becomingpresident, she replied, ``I don't see a difference with him.''Pointing to several people in the room, she said, ``I see adifference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's justdifferent when you're president. Everybody treats you differentlywhen you're president.''   Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs.Bush said, ``I spend half my life saying, `Could you please get thevice president on the phone?' and the operator says, `Do you reallywant Dan Quayle' or `Don't you know Dan Quayle's in Venezuela.'''   More seriously, she said, one big difference for Bush is that``everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is thepresident of the United States.''   And yet, she said of her husband: ``I think he's exactly thesame.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband hadstopped doing that briefly but ``after awhile they all became normalagain. It just took a little while. ...   ``I call him Mr. President sometimes _ when I'm needling him ...to tease him, `Yes, Mr. President.'''   The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of lawsbanning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures tooutlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of riflesare pending in Congress and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which fivechildren were killed and 29 others, as well as a teacher, werewounded in Stockton, Calif. last month.   Mrs. Bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed.``They should be, absolutely,'' she said.   While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. Bushsaid that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, anavid outdoorsman.   ``I went hunting with George once,'' Mrs. Bush recalled. ``Hetold me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his headcame right through that little circle (the rifle scope). I put downthe gun and said, `That's it. I'm not going to do that again.'''   Earlier Friday, Mrs. Bush visited the United Community MinistriesInc. in the Washington suburb of Alexandria and praised the center'sstaff of volunteers.   ``It reinforces my belief that we have got to help the workingpoor,'' she told reporters during her 40-minute visit.   The first lady helped carry from the trunk of her limousine sevenplastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of theWhite House staff donated.   The center is a private, non-profit organization whose programsinclude a thrift shop, food pantry, medical clinics, day care,counseling and financial assistance.   Mrs. Bush posed for photographers with four children from thefacility's day care center. They included 4-year-old Amber Daniels,who handed Mrs. Bush a ``mock voting tally'' from the preschoolclass, showing President Bush with a clear margin over DemocratMichael Dukakis.   ``That just makes me feel wonderful,'' the first lady said.</TEXT></DOC>
