The December increase in the department's consumer price index was the smallest since July 1986, when prices were unchanged from the previous month. The full-year rise was the biggest since an 8.9% jump in 1981. Prices rose 0.3% in November and 1.1% for all of 1986.    Separately, the Commerce Department said housing starts plunged 16.2% last month as apartment building nosedived. For all of 1987, starts fell 10.4% to the lowest level since 1982. Several analysts suggested that the 33.7% December drop in starts of multi-family housing reflected a return to more normal levels after a 22.5% spurt in November. Still, most economists expect overall starts to decline in 1988, partly as a result of continued high vacancy rates for apartments.    Economists were generally optimistic about inflation, playing down the acceleration last year. &quot;I get nervous when you start talking about the worst since 1981,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;Inflation heated up temporarily and now it's settled back to about where it's been for five years. The truth of the matter is we've got a good shot at beating this (4.4%) number this year.&quot;    The housing starts data had a depressing effect on stock prices yesterday. The decline in stocks, however, eased some investors' worries about inflation, sparking a mild rally in the bond market.    The acceleration in the inflation rate last year was due almost entirely to a swing in energy prices, which rose 8.2% in 1987 after declining 19.7% in 1986. Most of the 1987 rise came in the first half of the year. Excluding energy, prices increased 4.1% in 1987 after a 3.8% rise in 1986. Many analysts expect oil prices to move more moderately this year.    Wayne Angell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said it is &quot;very important&quot; that the inflation rate be lower this year and in the 2% range for 1989. In remarks to reporters after a speech to the American Bankers Association, he said that money-supply growth &quot;at a very slow and steady rate&quot; could accomplish these goals.    He expressed disappointment at the 4.4% rise for last year, although he said &quot;we have to take encouragement that we've done as well as we've done,&quot; in light of the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies. A lower dollar pushes up import prices, giving domestic producers more room to raise prices, too.    Economists generally expect higher import prices to have a more noticeable effect on domestic prices this year, but few are expecting a dollar-related surge. In addition, many economists are anticipating weakness in consumer spending in the wake of the stock market crash. Such a weakness would tend to hold down price increases.    In December, apparel prices fell 1.2% as a result of widespread discounting, after rising 0.5% in November. For the year, clothing prices, which are sensitive to import prices, were up 4.9%, the biggest rise since one of 6.8% in 1980.    Energy prices fell 1.1% last month after a 0.8% rise in November. Gasoline prices fell 2.2% in December but rose 18.6% for the year. Food prices increased 0.5% last month, with lettuce jumping a record 72.4%. Lettuce prices have doubled in the past two months because of a shortage resulting from the white fly virus, the Labor Department said. Food prices inched up 0.1% in November.    The monthly figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variations. Before adjustment, the consumer price index was unchanged last month at 345.7% of its 1967 average, up 4.4% from a year earlier.    The price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers rose 0.1% in December after a 0.3% rise in November. This measure, which includes half the number of people covered by the broader index, is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits. Before seasonal adjustment, this index fell 0.1% to 340.2% of its 1967 average and was 4.5% above a year earlier.    The housing report showed that work was begun on new homes last month at an annual rate of 1,374,000, down from a 1,639,000-unit pace in November. In all of 1987, 1,617,100 homes were started, the Commerce Department said. That was down from 1,805,400 in 1986 and the lowest since 1,062,200 in the recession year of 1982.    Starts rose a revised 6.6% in November. Previously, that increase was put at 7.5%.    Several economists attributed the weakness in home building to uncertainty about the economy and interest rates in the wake of the crash, as well as to the high vacancy rates for apartments. But Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National Association of Home Builders, asserted that it's particularly risky to draw conclusions from one month's statistics in the winter, when relatively few starts actually occur and small changes can skew the seasonally adjusted figures.    Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said the decline for 1987 partly reflects the fact that little pent-up demand remains after five years of economic expansion and that mortgage rates were higher on average last year than in 1986. &quot;It was not a bad year, but not a good year,&quot; he said, adding that he expects starts to fall about 5% this year.    Last month, starts of single-family homes fell 7.8% to an annual rate of 1,023,000 units after a 0.5% rise in November to a 1,110,000-unit pace. The drop in multi-family units brought them to a rate of 351,000 units in December from a 529,000-unit pace in November.    Building permits were issued last month at an annual rate of 1,340,000 units, down 8.8% from a 1,469,000-unit pace the month before. Permits rose a revised 0.4% in November. The department previously reported the November change as a 0.7% drop.    Separately, the Labor Department also said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.8% in December after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings rose 0.2% in November.    The latest figures reflect a 0.2% drop in average hourly earnings and a 0.6% decline in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $316.12 after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $318.64 in November. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings rose to $318.64 from $318.07.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for December.                                        % change from                                       Nov.
