The theory of the measurement and a detailed design ofa polarimeter constructed to measure the poloidal field profile in theTexas Experimental Tokamak (TEXT) are presented. The instrument measuresthe difference between left-hand and right-hand circularly polarizedline profiles, a quantity directly proportional to the magnetic fieldcomponent in the direction of observation. The high throughput of theFabry--Perot interferometer employed in this design, combined with efficientlight-collecting optics and lock-in detection of the polarization signal,allows measurement of the fractional circular polarization of the magneticdipole line Ti XVII 3834 A with an accuracy on the order of 10{sup -3}.The line-of-sight averaged poloidal field is determined with uncertaintyas small as 50 G. The line emission used in the present measurement isnot well localized in the plasma, necessitating the use of a spatialinversion procedure to obtain the local values of the field.</TEXT></DOC>
