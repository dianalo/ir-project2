Ronald F. Marryott, NavalAcademy superintendent, told the thousands gathered in Navy-MarineCorps Memorial Stadium to watch graduation exercises for the classof 1988 as a light rain began to fall.   The academy's class of 1,041 graduates included 77 women, 46Hispanics, 38 blacks, 36 Orientals, two native Americans and sevencitizens of six foreign nations.   Immediately after receiving their diplomas, 855 of the graduateswere sworn in as Navy ensigns nd 174 as Marine Corps 2ndlieutenants. Five graduates will become 2nd lieutenants in the AirForce, and the foreign students will return home.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told the graduates that theUnited States welcomes signs of change in the Soviet Union but mustremain aware that Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could mask aresurgence of Soviet military power.   ``The departure of President Reagan today for the summitdemonstrates a commitment to explore all reasonable avenues tolessen the tensions that divide us,'' he said.   If Gorbachev's goal ``is to change Soviet society in a way thatmakes it less aggressive in its expansionist policies, then we willall have gained,'' said Carlucci. ``On the other hand, if the Westheeds the siren call and relaxes its security guard, only to awakento a rebirth of Soviet military power, based on a modernized andtechnologically advanced industrial base, then we will have made anenormous miscalculation.''   Carlucci called Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative,popularly known as ``Star Wars,'' the first major step in reversingnuclear military capabilities from an offensive to a defensiveforce. He predicted the Navy will play a greater role in themilitary's space involvement.   ``Imaginative thinking is under way,'' he said, ``as can be seenin proposals to use naval platforms to launch replacementsatellites in the event of a conflict. Thus, the Navy willunquestionably adapt to the nation's changing defense requirements.   He also recommended U.S. policy makers ``carefully construct oursecurity relationship'' with Japan, Korea and China, countries hepredicted would exert greater economic and political influences onthe world in the future.   At West Point, the U.S. Military Academy graduated its 190thclass, sending 939 new junior officers into the armed forces.   Vice President George Bush, former Chief Justice Warren Burgerand Lt. Gen. Dave R. Palmer, Weest Point superintendent, handed outdiplomas to 849 men and 90 women in a rain-drenched ceremony atMichie Stadium.   In the commencement address, Bush criticized what he called the``liberal elite'' who, he said, never understood that the SovietUnion must be dealt with from strength.   ``They are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see whatAmericans have understood for 40 years; that peace flows fromstrength,'' the Republican presidential aspirant said in what wasbilled as a non-political speech.   Political campaigning is prohibited at military installations.   The vice president told the cadets that it was a good thing thatthe United States and Soviet Union engaged in summit meetings, buthe said Americans must not become complacent about the Sovietthreat just because the two sides were talking.   He said the times require leadership that ``will pursuenegotiations with the Soviet realistically.''   Douglas Fraley, 21, of Irondale, Ohio, was at the top of theclass, finishing with the best academic record and also winning aRhodes scholarship. The class boasted a second Rhodes scholar, JohnNagl, 22, of Omaha, Neb.   The class goat was Michael Klee, 22, of El Paso, Texas. ``Toomuch socializing and not enough studying,'' was Klee's explanationfor his finishing at the bottom academically.   The goat is not formally designated by the academy, and theidentity of the cadet who squeaked through becomes known onlybecause of the extra-loud cheers when his name is read. He also isslipped a bag of money collected by classmates relieved at havingescaped his fate.</TEXT></DOC>
