These amendments are proposed to conform the regulations tosection 1112(b) and (e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. (TRA '86) (100 Stat.2444).<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to Qualified Plans</ITAG>Generally, section 401(a)(26) imposes new minimum participation requirementsthat plans must meet in order to be qualified under section 401(a). Theserules are, in general, operational. To the extent that a plan does notmeet the requirements of section 401(a)(26), the plan must be amended asof the date provided herein in order to retain qualification, such amendmentto be effective as of the first day of the first plan year to which section401(a)(26) applies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis</ITAG>In GeneralSection 401(a)(26) requires that a qualified plan benefit at least thelesser of 50 employees or 40 percent of all employees of the employer.Section 401(a)(26) applies separately to an employer's active employeesand the employer's former employees. In addition, to the extent determinedby the Secretary, section 401(a)(26) applies separately to certain separatebenefit structures, trusts, and other arrangements. The minimum participationrequirement may not be satisfied by aggregating separate plans, even ifsuch plans are identical in all respects or are treated as a single planfor coverage and nondiscrimination purposes and, as such, are treated asproviding nondiscriminatory employer contributions or benefits.Pursuant to the grant of regulatory authority to provide that certain separatebenefit structures may be treated as separate plans subject to section401(a)(26), the proposed regulation provides that a plan satisfies section401(a)(26) only if each current benefit structure under the plan satisfiessection 401(a)(26) and, in the case of a defined benefit plan (but nota defined contribution plan), the plan's prior benefit structure satisfiessection 401(a)(26). Under the regulation, a single current benefit structureexists with respect to each portion of a uniform benefit formula (eithera formula for allocating contributions and forfeitures under a definedcontribution plan or a formula for determining an employee's benefit attributableto the current year under a defined contribution plan) to the extent thatsubsidies, optional forms of benefit, rights and features are providedon a uniform basis to employees eligible to participate under such formula.Finally, each defined benefit plan (but not a defined contribution plan)includes a single prior benefit structure that includes all benefits accruedunder the plan as of the end of the prior year.Section 401(a)(26) generally is effective with respect to plan years beginningafter December 31, 1988. A deferred effective date applies with respectto certain collectively bargained plans.Significant Special and Transitional RulesThe proposed regulation includes a variety of permanent special rules designedto facilitate the application of and compliance with section 401(a)(26),and includes several transition rules for plan years beginning in 1989.The most significant of the special permanent rules are as follows:1. A current benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) even thoughthe structure benefits less than 50 employees and less than 40 percentof the employer's employees as long as the structure benefits at least20 employees who primarily are nonhighly compensated employees and thestructure is included in a plan that currently provides meaningful benefitaccruals to at least 50 total employees. If such a current benefit structurebenefits only employees who become employed by the employer in connectionwith a corporate acquisition or similar transaction, the structure is treatedas satisfying section 401(a)(26) for 5 plan years after the transactioneven though the structure benefiting such employees may benefit fewer than20 employees.2. A current benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) without regardto the number of employees that it benefits as long as such structure benefitsonly employees who are not, and have never been, highly compensated employeesof the employer, and such structure (and the benefits thereunder) are notrelied upon by any other plan or current benefit structure to satisfy sections410(b) or 401(a)(4).3. A defined contribution plan's prior benefit structure is deemed to satisfysection 401(a)(26). Thus, a frozen defined contribution plan satisfiessection 401(a)(26) without regard to the number of employees who have benefitsunder the plan.4. A defined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26)if at least 100 active and former employees have more than de minimis benefitsunder the plan and no three highly compensated employees have more than25 percent of the total accrued benefits under the plan.5. A defined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26)if the plan provides additional, meaningful benefit accruals under oneor more current benefit structures for at least 50 employees or 40 percentof the employer's employees.6. Most defined benefit plans that satisfy section 401(a)(26) with respectto prior benefit structures because the plans provide additional meaningfulcurrent benefit accruals will satisfy section 401(a)(26) in subsequentyears with respect to the plan's prior structure without any requirementfor retesting as long as the current benefit formula (including the rateof accrual) relied on remains in effect and continues to provide benefitaccruals to a group of employees that satisfies the requirements of section401(a)(26).The most significant of the transition rules included in the proposed regulationfor plan years beginning in 1989 are as follows: 1. A simplified definition of current benefit structure applies for the1989 plan year so that only major plan benefit features need to be takeninto account. 2. A reasonable compliance standard applies for the 1989 plan year fordetermining whether a defined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfiessection 401(a)(26). 3. Certain plans may be terminated on or before May 31, 1989, without beingamended to comply with section 401(a)(26). 4. Employer reversions with respect to certain defined benefit plans mayqualify for the waiver of the excise tax under section 4980 even thoughthe date of plan termination occurs after section 401(a)(26) becomes effectivewith respect to the plan as long the date of plan termination occurs onor before May 31, 1989, and plan assets are distributed to participantswithin a reasonable time after such termination. Separate Benefit Structures The proposed regulation provides that each single plan within the meaningof section 414(l) is a separate plan for purposes of section 401(a)(26)that must satisfy section 401(a)(26). In addition, the regulation providesthat each separate benefit structure under a plan must satisfy section401(a)(26). The rules in the proposed regulation that govern the identification andtesting of separate benefit structures are designed to reflect these basicpolicy objectives of section 401(a)(26): 1. Promote the integrity of the distinctions in the deduction limits andthe contribution and benefit limits as they apply to defined benefit plansand defined contribution plans by limiting the extent to which a definedbenefit plan generally may operate as an individual account for one ora small group of employees. 2. Promote the nondiscriminatory provision of benefits by limiting theextent to which an employer is able to design different benefit formulasfor different employees in order to maximize benefit disparities in favorof highly compensated employees. 3. Limit the extent to which an employer maintaining a defined benefitplan that is not providing active employees with meaningful, additionalbenefits (e.g., a frozen or substantially frozen defined benefit plan)is able to delay plan termination in order to (i) increase the amount ofits reversion upon plan termination, (ii) delay its receipt of the reversionto maximize its own benefit, or (iii) delay a benefit increase to favora small group of highly compensated employees who remain with benefitsunder the plan. The proposed regulation thus exercises the grant of regulatory authorityto provide that certain separate benefit structures are to be treated asseparate plans subject to section 401(a)(26). Instead of providing thatsuch separate benefit structures are to be treated as separate plans, theproposed regulation directly applies section 401(a)(26) to such separatebenefit structures. Thus, the proposed regulation provides that each currentbenefit structure that is included in a single plan (within section 414(l)is a separate benefit structure that must satisfy section 401(a)(26). Inaddition, each defined benefit plan (within section 414(l) includes a singleprior benefit structure that must satisfy section 401(a)(26). Pursuant to the proposed regulation, a single current benefit structureunder a defined contribution plan comprises a uniform formula under whichcontributions and forfeitures are allocated among employees for the currentyear and uniform subsidies, optional forms of benefits, rights and featuresare provided. In the case of a defined benefit plan, a single current benefitstructure comprises a uniform benefit formula under which an employee'sbenefit attributable to the current year of service is determined and uniformsubsidies, optional forms of benefits, rights and features are providedto the participants benefiting under such structure. Thus, for example,a defined benefit plan that currently provides three different benefitformulas for determining the benefits of three different groups of employeesis treated as having three separate current benefit structures each ofwhich must separately satisfy section 401(a)(26). Similarly, a definedbenefit plan which provides for a single benefit formula but makes a singlesum distribution available to division A employees and not to divisionB employees is treated as having two separate current benefit structureseach of which must separately satisfy section 401(a)(26). A current structureexists whenever there is an increase in accruals whether as a result ofadditional years of service, changes in compensation, or other factors.Such increases are treated as benefit attributable to the year of servicein which they accrue. Multiple employer plans must satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(26)on an employer-by-employer basis rather than on the basis of participatingemployers in the aggregate. Failure to satisfy the requirements of section401(a)(26) with respect to any component of this testing process may resultin disqualification of the plan for all participating employers. The proposedregulation does not provide an exception to this rule. However, in a propercase, the Commissioner could retain the plan's qualified status for innocentemployers by requiring corrective and remedial action with respect to theplan such as allowing the withdrawal of an offending employer, allowinga disqualifying defect to be cured within a reasonable period of time afterthe plan administrator has or should have had knowledge of such disqualifyingevent or was otherwise notified by the Internal Revenue Service of thedisqualifying defects, or requiring plan amendments to prevent future disqualifyingevents. To the extent that coverage under a multiemployer plan is treatedas being provided, in whole or in part, under a multiple employer plan,this relief is applicable to the multiemployer plan. Finally, the proposed regulation provides that a separate current benefitstructure exists if any person has any priority, either under the termsof the plan or under any arrangement outside of the plan, with respectto any assets of a defined benefit plan, such as the right to some or allof a possible reversion. Essentially, the proposed regulations providethat if, under all the facts and circumstances, an arrangement (eitherunder or outside the plan) has the effect of modifying any feature underthe plan taken into account in determining an employee's benefit, providingany employee with any priority or greater interest in a portion of theassets in the plan, or linking any financial matter involving an employeeto all or a portion of the assets in the plan in a way that has the effectof creating separate accounts, such arrangement will be treated as creatinga separate current benefit structure within the plan. Current Benefit Structure RequirementsThe proposed regulation provides that, in order for a plan to satisfy section401(a)(26), each current benefit structure that benefits any active employeein the plan must benefit at least the lesser of 50 active employees or40 percent of an employer's active employees. Similarly, a current benefitstructure that benefits any former employee must benefit at least the lesserof 50 former employees or 40 percent of the employer's former employees.This approach to separate benefit structures is equivalent to providingthat each current benefit structure is a separate plan that, as such, mustsatisfy section 401(a)(26).The proposed regulation includes a special restructuring rule under whichan employer may, solely for purposes of testing under section 401(a)(26),treat a benefit formula under a plan that would be a single current benefitstructure but for differences in the rate of benefit accrual or contributionallocation into restructured separate benefit structures, one consistingof the lesser included portion of the formuals common to each of the benefitstructures and one or more consisting of the portion(s) of the formula(s)that is not common to each of the benefit formulas. An employer may applythe rules of section 401(a)(26) to a plan's current benefit structureson the basis of this restructuring rule without amending the plan in anyrespect to reflect such restructuring. Thus, for example, a defined contributionplan that has a 10 percent of compensation allocation formula for one groupof employees and a 15 percent of compensation allocation formula for anothergroup of employees may be treated, under the restructuring rule, as havinga 10 percent of compensation formula applicable to both groups of employeesand a 5 percent of compensation formula applicable only to the group ofemployees subject to the explicit, 15 percent plan formula. Even thoughthe plan explicitly includes the 10 percent and 15 percent formulas, theplan may be tested under section 401(a)(26) on the basis of the restructured10 percent and 5 percent formulas.The proposed regulation provides a special rule permitting a current benefitstructure to satisfy section 401(a)(26) if such structure benefits at leastthe lesser of 20 active employees (rather than 50 active employees) or40 percent of the employer's active employees. This special rule is availableonly if certain coverage and nondiscrimination requirements are satisfiedand, in addition, the plan that includes the current benefit structureprovides meaningful benefits (determined under the minimum current benefitstructure test applicable with respect to prior benefit structures) toat least the lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer'sactive employees.The proposed regulation also includes special rules for certain currentbenefit structures that benefit only nonhighly compensated employees andfor certain current benefit structures that benefit only employees ``acquired''in connection with a merger or acquisition.Prior Benefit Structure RequirementsUnder the proposed regulation, a defined benefit plan (but not a definedcontribution plan) is required to satisfy section 401(a)(26) with respectto the plan's prior benefit structure. As it does with current benefitstructures, the proposed regulation does not provide that a prior benefitstructure is a separate plan that, as such, must satisfy section 401(a)(26).Rather, the proposed regulation provides that each defined benefit planhas a single prior benefit structure that is treated as satisfying section401(a)(26) only if at least one of several alternative tests is satisfied.This approach to separate benefit structures does not result in the applicationof any requirement that could not also have been applied by providing anarrower definition of separate prior benefit structures and then providingthat such structures are separate plans subject to section 401(a)(26).For example, in lieu of providing that a defined benefit plan's prior benefitstructure satisfies section 401(a)(26) if the plan provides meaningful,additional benefit accruals to active employees, the proposed regulationcould have been drafted to accomplish the same result by providing thata defined benefit plan does not have a prior benefit structure if the planprovides additional, meaningful benefits to active employees. Similarly,in lieu of providing that a frozen plan's prior benefit structure satisfiessection 401(a)(26) if there are at least 50 active and former employeesor 40 percent of the employer's active and former employees with meaningfulbenefits under the plan, the proposed regulation could have been draftedto provide that the portion of the frozen plan that includes employeeswith meaningful benefits is a separate benefit structure and that suchseparate structure is a separate plan which must benefit at least the lesserof 50 employees or 40 percent of the employer's employees.The regulation includes six alternative tests under which a defined benefitplan's prior benefit structure may satisfy section 401(a)(26). These testsare designed to reflect the policy objectives of section 401(a)(26) withoutalso requiring employers to track the many different benefit structuresthat may have been in effect at various times under their plans or to determinewhether employees continue to have benefits under such different benefitstructures.A defined benefit plan need only satisfy one of the six alternative testsset forth in the proposed regulation. Thus, for example, in accordancewith one of the alternative tests, if at least 100 active and former employeeshave at least de minimis benefits under a defined benefit plan and no threehighly compensated employees have benefits in excess of 25 percent of thetotal benefits under the plan, the defined benefit plan's prior benefitstructure satisfies section 401(a)(26). The employer need not satisfy anyof the other alternative tests with respect to such plan's prior benefitstructure.The prior benefit structure tests fall into two general categories. Thefirst category reflects the view that a defined benefit plan that is providingadditional, meaningful, benefit accruals to active employees should notbe forced either to improve benefits or to terminate simply because thereis only a small number of employees with prior accrued benefits under theplan. The tests in this category thus provide that if a plan includes oneor more current benefit structures for active employees that provide currentbenefit accruals that are meaningful relative to the benefits that haveotherwise accrued under the plan, the plan's prior benefit structure isdeemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26). (This is equivalent to providingthat such plan does not include a prior benefit structure that must betreated as a separate plan subject to section 401(a)(26).)The prior benefit structure tests in the second category are designed todetermine whether a plan that does not include a meaningful current benefitstructure (e.g., a frozen or substantially frozen defined benefit plan)nevertheless includes meaningful or more than de minimis accrued benefitsfor sufficient numbers of active and former employees. (These tests areequivalent to defining a plan's prior benefit structure to include onlythose employees with prior accrued benefits equal to or above a meaningfulor de minimis level of benefits and then treating only such portion ofthe plan as a separate benefit structure that must separately satisfy section401(a)(26).)The first category of prior benefit structure tests includes four alternativetests. Under the minimum current accrual rate test, a defined benefit plan'sprior benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) if at least 50 activeemployees or 40 percent of the employer's active employees have currentaccrual rates for the current year of service that are at least equal to0.75 percent of final average compensation or 1.1 percent of career averagecompensation. Under the nondecreasing current benefit structure test, adefined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26)if at least 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer's activeemployees (including the top three highly compensated employees of theemployer) have hypothetical accrued benefits (determined by assuming thatcurrent benefit structures under the plan have always been in effect) equalto or greater than their actual accrued benefits under the plan. Underthe minimum current benefit structure test, a defined benefit plan's priorbenefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) if the plan includes atleast one current benefit structure that provides active employees withat least a minimum benefit accrued, which is determined by reference tothe largest benefits under the plan for the highly compensated employees.Finally, under the benefit ratio test, a defined benefit plan's prior benefitstructure satisfies section 401(a)(26) if the sum of the accrued benefitsof all active employees under the plan is less than 60 percent of the sumof the projected accrued benefits of all active employees under the planand if the plan satisfies the concentration test (described below).The second category of prior benefit structure tests includes two alternativetests, which are designed for plans that do not satisfy at least one ofthe four preceding tests. Under the minimum accrued benefit test, a definedbenefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) ifthere are at least 50 active and former employees or 40 percent of theemployer's active and former employees with at least a minimum benefit,which is determined by reference to the largest benefits under the planfor the highly compensated employees. Under the minimum employee coveragetest, a defined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies section401(a)(26) if at least 100 active and former employees of the employerhave more than de minimis benefits under such plan and the plan satisfiesthe concentration test.The concentration test, which applies under both the benefit ratio andthe minimum employee coverage tests, is satisfied by a plan only if thesum of the benefits of the three highly compensated active and former employeesof the employer with the largest benefits under the plan does not constitutemore than 25 percent of the sum of the total benefits of all active andformer employees under the plan.In making these prior benefit structure determinations, an employee's accruedbenefit under the plan being tested is the employee's actual accrued benefitunder such plan. Thus, benefits provided under social security or similarFederal or state law, the permitted disparity under section 401(l), andbenefits provided under any other plan generally are disregarded. However,the method for determining whether an employee's benefit is at least aminimum benefit relative to either the largest or other benefits undera plan is designed to take into account the permitted disparity under section401(l) without regard to whether the plan being tested actually uses suchpermitted disparity.Finally, the proposed regulation contains a delegation of authority tothe Commissioner to prescribe additional tests under which a plan's priorbenefit structure will satisfy section 401(a)(26). This delegation of authority,and similar delegations of authority in other sections of the proposedregulation, states that the delegation may be exercised only in the formof revenue rulings, notices or other documents of general applicability.No inferences should be drawn with respect to the manner in which the Commissionermay exercise other delegations of authority provided for in this or otherregulations.ExceptionsThe proposed regulation includes three exceptions under which a plan isdeemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26). First, the proposed regulation includesthe statutory rule under which the portion of a multiemployer plan thatbenefits employees who are covered pursuant to a collective bargainingagreement is deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26). However, this exceptiondoes not apply with respect to any collective bargaining agreement if morethan two percent of the employees covered pursuant to such agreement areprofessional employees (e.g., doctors, lawyers, architects, and investmentbankers).In addition, the proposed regulation adopts a special rule described inthe legislative history under which a plan is deemed to satisfy section401(a)(26) if such plan does not benefit, either for the current year orfor any of the five immediately preceding plan years, any employee whois or ever has been a highly compensated employee. This special rule isavailable only if the plan is not aggregated with any other plan for purposesof applying the minimum coverage or nondiscrimination rules to any suchplan (including the average benefit test in section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)).Finally, the proposed regulation includes a limited exception for certainunderfunded defined benefit plans. As set forth previously, if a definedbenefit plan is frozen and does not include meaningful benefits for sufficientnumbers of employees, section 401(a)(26) generally should operate to forcethe employer to wind up the plan when the number of employees with meaningfulbenefits under the plan is less than 50 employees or 40 percent of theemployees of the employer. However, the proposed regulation provides that,in general, a defined benefit plan is deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26)if such plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or primarily benefits nonhighlycompensated employees; the plan does not contain sufficient assets to satisfyall liabilities under the plan; all benefit accruals under the plan haveceased; and the plan does not rely on this rule for more than three years.In addition, a plan covered by Title IV of ERISA that would have failedsection 401(a)(26) for the plan year containing August 16, 1986, if suchsection had been in effect for such year, can rely on this rule for planyears commencing before January 1, 1994.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reliance on These Proposed Regulations</ITAG>Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations for guidance pending theissuance of final regulations. Because these regulations are generallyeffective for plan years beginning after 1988, the Service will apply theseproposed regulations in issuing rulings and in examining returns with respectto taxpayers and plans. If future regulations are more restrictive, suchguidance will be applied without retroactive effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this proposedrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that aregulatory impact analysis is therefore not required. Although this documentis a notice of proposed rulemaking which solicits public comments, theInternal Revenue Service has concluded that the regulations proposed hereinare interpretative and that the notice and public procedure requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply. Accordingly, the proposed regulations donot constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. Chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for Public Hearing</ITAG>Before adopting there proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) tothe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available forpublic inspection and copying.

If a planincludes a current benefit structure for former employees, the plan alsomust satisfy paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to such currentbenefit structure. Also, a defined benefit plan (but not a defined contributionplan) must satisfy the requirements of andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6 with respectto its prior benefit structure.

In testing current benefit structures under paragraphs(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, an employer may, in certain circumstances,restructure two or more current benefit formulas under a plan that wouldconstitute a single structure but for differences in the rate of benefitaccural or contribution allocation into restructured separate benefit structures,one consisting of the portion of the formulas that is common to each ofthe benefit structures and one or more consisting of the portion(s) ofthe formula that is not common to each of the benefit formulas. Each ofthe resulting restructured benefit structures must satisfy paragraph (b)(1)or (b)(2) of this section, whichever is applicable. See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2(e)(1)for rules governing the restructuring of current benefit formulas.(ii) <T3>Example</T3>. The rule in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may beillustrated by the following example.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example</T3>. Defined benefit plan A includes two current benefit structures_oneof which benefits the 200 active employees of division X and provides abenefit of 1\1/2\ percent times years of service times final average compensation,and the other of which benefits the 30 active employees of division Y andprovides a benefit of 1 percent times years of service times final averagecompensation. In all other respects, employees have identical rights underthe plan. Division X's current benefit structure satisfies paragraph (b)(1)of this section, but division Y's current benefit structure fails to satisfysuch paragraph. However, the two current benefit structures may be retestedon the basis of two restructured current benefit structures. (Under andSection;1.401(a)(26)-2(e)(1), an employer is not required to amend a plan to reflectthe restructured current benefit structures in order to be able to usethe restructuring method of testing under section 401(a)(26)). One restructuredcurrent benefit structure, which provides a benefit of 1 percent timesyears of service times final average compensation, benefits all 230 activeemployees of divisions X and Y. The other restructured current benefitstructure, which provides a benefit of \1/2\ percent times years of servicetimes final average compensation, benefits division X's 200 active employees.Both of the restructured current benefit structures thus satisfy paragraph(b)(1) of this section.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Current benefit structures that benefit at least 20 active employees_</T3>(i)<T3>In general</T3>. A plan may apply paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this sectionfor a plan year by substituting ``20 active employees'' for ``50 activeemployees'' if the tests in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) and (c)(4)(iii) of thissection are satisfied for such plan year.(ii) <T3>Minimum nonhighly compensated employee test. </T3>This test is satisfiedfor a plan year only if at least 70 percent of the active employees whobenefit under the current benefit structure being tested are nonhighlycompensated employees.(iii) <T3>Minimum participation test_</T3>(A) <T3>Defined benefit plans.</T3> This test is satisfied with respect toa defined benefit plan for a plan year only if, as of the close of suchyear, at least the lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer'sactive employees have future service benefit rates (or current accrualrates) under the plan that includes the current benefit structure beingtested that are at least the minimum benefit rate (or the minimum currentaccrual rate) for such plan. See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b)(2)(iv)(B)and (c)(2) for the defintions of future service benefit rate and minimumbenefit rate. See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b) (2) (ii)(C) and (D) for thedefinition of current accrual rate and minimum current accural rate. Thistest is deemed to be satisfied for a plan year if, as of the close of suchyear, at least 100 active employees of the employer are currently accruinggreater than de minimis benefits under an ongoing benefit formula underthe plan that includes the current benefit structure being tested and theplan satisfies the concentration test set forth in paragraph (b)(4) ofandSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6.(B) <T3>Defined contribution plans</T3>. This test is satisfied with respectto a defined contribution plan for a plan year only if, for such plan year,at least the lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer'sactive employees receive contribution allocations or, in the case of aplan subject to section 401(k) or 401(m), are eligible to receive contributionallocations, under the plan that includes the current benefit structurebeing tested, that are greater than de minimis allocations.(3) <T3>Current benefit structures that do not benefit any highly compensatedemployees. </T3>A current benefit structure is deemed to satisfy paragraph(b)(1) of this section for a plan year if such current benefit structuredoes not benefit any active employee who is or ever has been a highly compensatedemployee of the employer. This paragraph (c)(5) is available to a currentbenefit structure only if such structure is included in a plan that benefitsat least the lesser of 50 employees or 40 percent of the employer's employees,and all plans of the employer (including the plan that includes the currentbenefit structure being tested) would satisfy sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b)(including the average benefit test of section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)) if theemployees benefitting under the current benefit structure being testedwere treated as accruing no benefits under such structure. For purposesof this paragraph (c)(5), employees who were highly compensated employeesonly for plan years ending before January 1, 1984, are treated as not havingbeen highly compensated employees.(4) <T3>Qualified cash or deferred arrangements maintained by employers thatinclude certain governmental or tax-exempt entities_</T3>(i) <T3>General rule</T3>. In the case of a plan including a qualified cashor deferred arrangement under section 401(k) that is maintained by an employerwhich employs employees precluded from being eligible employees under thearrangement by reason of section 401(k)(4)(B), the current benefit structureconsisting of elective contributions under the arrangement is deemed tosatisfy paragraph (b)(1) of this section if more than 95 percent of allactive employees of the employer benefit under such current benefit structure.Solely for purposes of this determination, employees precluded from beingeligible employees under the qualified cash or deferred arrangement byreason of section 401(k)(4)(B) are to be treated as excludable employees.This paragraph (c)(6) applies also to employer matching contributions thatare subject to section 401(m) and are geared to elective contributionsunder a qualified cash or deferred arrangement that satisfies this paragraph(c)(6).(ii) <T3>Example</T3>. The rule of this paragraph (c)(6) can be illustratedby the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21">Example: Assume that an employer (determined after application ofsections 414 (b), (c), (m), (o), and (r)) consists of one taxable entitythat has 30 active employees and several tax-exempt entities that have,in the aggregate, 500 active employees. Assume further that the employermaintains a plan including a qualified cash or deferred arrangement forthe 30 active employees of the taxable entity, and that section 401(k)(4)(B)precludes all of the 500 active employees of the tax-exempt entities fromeligibility under the arrangement. Because 30 active employees is lessthan the lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer's530 active employees (i.e., 212 employees), the current benefit structureconsisting of the cash or deferred arrangement fails to satisfy paragraph(b)(1) of this section. However, under this paragraph (c)(6), this currentbenefit structure is deemed to satisfy paragraph (b)(1) of this sectionbecause the current benefit structure benefits 100 percent of the employer'sactive employees, determined by disregarding all of the 500 active employeesof the tax-exempt entities who are precluded from eligibility by reasonof section 401(k)(4)(B).</ITAG>(5) <T3>Current benefit structures for former employees. </T3>In the case ofa plan that includes a current benefit structure for former employees (e.g.,a plan that is amended to provide an ad hoc cost-of-living adjustment tothe benefit provided former employees under the plan), such current benefitstructure is deemed to satisfy paragraph (b)(2) of this section if at leastfive former employees benefit under such current benefit structure andeither more than 95 percent of all former employees with benefits underthe plan benefit under such current benefit structure or at least 60 percentof the former employees who benefit under such current benefit structureare not highly compensated former employees. Solely for purposes of thisdetermination, a former employee who has a vested accrued benefit underthe plan and is an excludable former employee under andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-4(c)(3)solely because such employee's vested accrued benefit is not in excessof $3,500 is not treated as an excludable former employee.(6) <T3>Certain acquisitions or dispositions</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Under section 401(a)(26), rules similar to rules prescribedunder section 410(b)(6)(C)(i) shall apply.(ii) <T3>Transition rule. </T3>Where there has been a transaction describedin section 401(b)(6)(C) in the year prior to the first year in which section401(a)(26) becomes effective with respect to a plan, affected by such transaction,which plan includes a current benefit structure, the current benefit structurewill satisfy section 401(a)(26) for the transition period commencing onthe date of the transaction and ending on the last day of the first planyear beginning after the date of the transaction if either of the followingtwo requirements is met:(A) The current benefit structure satisfies section 401(a)(26) immediatelybefore the transaction on the basis of only the applicable statutory provisions,without regard to the regulations under section 401(a)(26), in the mannerprovided in andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-8(c)(3). Thus, a current benefit structuresatisfies the requirements of section 401(a)(26), immediately prior tothe transaction, if such structure was part of a plan that benefited 50employees or 40 percent of the employees of the employer without regardto current or prior benefit structures existing under the plan.(B) The current benefit structure affected by the transaction satisfiesthe rule in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.(7) <T3>Acquisition current benefit structures. </T3>A current benefit structureunder a defined benefit plan that benefits only employees (acquisitionemployees) who become employed by the employer in connection with a corporateacquisition, merger or similar transaction (transaction) is deemed to satisfyparagraph (b)(1) of this section for a plan year if all of the followingrequirements are satisfied for the plan year:(i) The current benefit structure includes the same benefit formula thatexisted in the benefit structure under which such acquisition employeeswere benefiting immediately prior to the transaction or, if different,any difference reflects changes necessitated by changes in the applicablequalification requirements;(ii) Immediately after the transaction, the current benefit structure satisfiesthe test of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section;(iii) The current benefit structure is included in a defined benefit planthat, as of the current plan year, satisfies the test of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)of this section; and(iv) The transaction occurred either in the current plan year or any ofthe immediately preceding five plan years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In the case of a transaction occurring prior to the effective dateof section 401(a)(26) with respect to the plan, the requirements of paragraph(c)(3)(ii) of this section may be applied either immediately after thetransaction or as of the first day of the first plan year for which section401(a)(26) is effective, and the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iv) ofthis section may be applied as if the transaction occurred on December31, 1988.(d) <T3>Exceptions_</T3>(1) <T3>Plans that do not benefit any highly compensated employees_</T3>(i)<T3>General rule. </T3>A plan is deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26) fora plan year if such plan is not a top-heavy plan under section 416 andsuch plan (and any predecessor plan) does not benefit, for such plan yearand for any of the immediately preceding five plan years, any active orformer employee who is or ever has been a highly compensated employee ofthe employer (either as an active employee, former employee, or both).This paragraph (d)(1) is available to a plan being tested under section401(a)(26) only if all other plans of the employer would satisfy sections401(a)(4) and 410(b) (including section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)) if the employeesunder the plan being tested are treated as though they have no benefitsunder such plan. For purposes of applying this rule, employees who werehighly compensated employees only for plan years ending before January1, 1984, are not treated as highly compensated employees.(ii) <T3>Example. </T3>This paragraph (d)(1) can be illustrated by the followingexample:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example: </T3>Assume that an employer has 100 employees, only 5 ofwhom are highly compensated employees. The employer maintains two definedbenefit plans during a particular year: plan X has a uniform, unit benefitformula and benefits the employer's 5 highly compensated employees and70 of the nonhighly compensated employees, and plan Y benefits the remaining25 nonhighly-compensated employees. Plan X satisfies the ratio coveragetest of section 410(b)(1)(B) and section 401(a)(4) without regard to planY. Also, plan X is not top-heavy. If none of the nonhighly compensatedemployees benefit under plan Y have ever been highly compensated employeesof the employer, plan Y is deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26) for theyear even though only 25 employees benefit under such plan.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Multiemployer plan exception</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The portion of a multiemployer plan that, for a planyear, benefits only employees included in a unit of employees covered bya collective bargaining agreement is deemed to be a separate plan thatsatisfies section 401(a)(26) for such plan year. If a multiemployer planalso benefits employees who are not included in any collective bargainingunit, the portion of the plan benefiting such employees must separatelysatisfy section 401(a)(26).(ii) <T3>Covered by a collective bargaining agreement. </T3>An employee is coveredby a collective bargaining agreement only if such employee is representedby a bona fide employee representative that is a party to the collectivebargaining agreement or agreements under which the multiemployer plan ismaintained. Thus, for example, an employee of either the multiemployerplan or the employee representative is not included in a unit of employeescovered pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement under which theplan is maintained merely because the employee is covered under the planpursuant to an agreement entered into by the multiemployer plan or employeerepresentative on behalf of the employee (other than in the capacity ofan employee representative with respect to such employee). This is thecase even if all such employees covered under the plan constitute onlya de minimis percentage of the total employees benefiting under the plan.(iii) <T3>Multiemployer plans covering professional employes. </T3>This paragraph(d)(2) does not apply for a plan year with respect to a collective bargainingagreement if, for such year, more than 2 percent of the employees who arecovered pursuant to such agreement are professionals as defined in andSection;1.401(a)(26)-7(g).This paragraph (d)(2)(iii) is applied separately with respect to each collectivebaragaining agreement. Thus, for example, if a multiemployer plan benefitsa group of employees covered by collective bargaining agreement X and agroup of employees covered by collective bargaining agreement Y and ifmore than 2 percent of the employees covered pursuant to agreement X areprofessionals (but not agreement Y), this paragraph (d)(2) applies withrespect to employees covered pursuant to agreement Y, but not with respectto employees covered pursuant to agreement X.(3) <T3>Certain underfunded defined benefit plans</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A defined benefit plan is deemed to satisfy section401(a)(26) for a plan year if all of the conditions of pargraphs (d)(3)(ii)through (d)(3)(v) of this section are satisfied with respect to such planfor such year.(ii) <T3>Eligible plans. </T3>This condition is satisfied for a plan year onlyif the defined benefit plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA for such yearor if, as of the close of such year, the sum of the accrued benefits ofthe nonhighly compensated employees under the plan is at least 50 percentof the sum of the accrued benefits for all employees under the plan. Seeparagraph (c)(1) of andSection;1.401(a)(26)-6 for the definition of accruedbenefit.(iii) <T3>Actuarial certification. </T3>This condition is satisfied for a planyear only if an enrolled actuary provides the employer with an actuarialcertification that, as of the last day of the immediately preceding planyear, the defined benefit plan does not have sufficient assets to satisfyall liabilities under the plan (determined in accordance with section 401(a)(2)).Such certification must be included with a timely filed actuarial reportas required under section 6059.(iv) <T3>Cessation of all benefit accruals. </T3>This condition is satisfiedfor a plan only if, for such year, no employees accrue any additional benefitsunder the plan (including benefits attributable to increases in compensationor in the section 415 or section 401(a)(17) limits), except for the miniumbenefits for non-key employees required by section 416.(v) <T3>Plan year limitation. </T3>This condition is satisfied for a plan yearonly if the defined benefit plan does not rely on this paragraph (d)(3)to satisfy section 401(a)(26) for more than three plan years (includingthe current plan year). For plan years commencing before January 1, 1994,this condition may be applied by substituting ``five plan years'' for ``threeplan years'' in the preceding sentence if the plan being tested was inexistence on August 16, 1986; the plan would have failed to satisfy section401(a)(26) for the plan year including August 16, 1986, if such sectionhad applied with respect to such year; the plan fails to satisfy section401(a)(26) for the first plan year for which section 401(a)(26) applieswith respect to such plan; and the plan has not been involved in a planmerger, spinoff, asset or liability transfer or any similar transactionsince August 16, 1986. The determination of whether a plan would have failedto satisfy section 401(a)(26) for the plan year including August 16, 1986is to be made under the rules in andSection;1.401(a)(26)-8(c)(3).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions of plan, current benefit structure, and prior benefitstructure. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Plan. </T3>In general, the term ``plan'' refers to a plan describedin section 401(a) that includes one or more trusts intended to be exemptfrom tax under section 501(a), and an annuity plan described in section403(a). As described in paragraph (b) of this section, each single planunder section 414(l) is treated as a plan for purposes of section 401(a)(26).Under paragraph (c) of this section, in certain cases (including certainoutside arrangements), a plan that is a single plan under paragraph (b)may be treated as comprising separate plans for purposes of section 401(a)(26).Furthermore, in accordance with section 401(a)(26)(I), section 401(a)(26)also must be satisfied with respect to current benefit structures and,in the case of defined benefit plans, prior benefit structures. Paragraphs(d) and (e) of this section set forth rules for identifying a plan's currentbenefit structures and prior benefit structure. (b) <T3>Separate asset pools are separate plans. </T3>Each single plan withinthe meaning of section 414(l) is a separate plan for purposes of section401(a)(26). See andSection; 1.414(l)-1(b). For example, if only a portionof the assets under a defined benefit plan is available, on an ongoingbasis, to provide the benefits of certain employees and the remaining assetsare available only in certain limited cases to provide such benefits (butare available, in all cases, for the benefits of other employees), thereare two separate plans. A single plan under section 414(l) is a plan forpurposes of section 401(a)(26) notwithstanding that such plan comprisesseparate, written plan documents and separate trusts, each of which havereceived separate determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service.A defined contribution plan does not comprise separate plans merely becauseit includes more than one trust or it provides for separate accounts andpermits employees to direct the investment of the amounts allocated totheir accounts. Further, a plan does not comprise separate plans merelybecause assets are invested in individual insurance or annuity contractsfor employees. (c) <T3>Disaggregation of certain plans_</T3>(1) <T3>Plans that include individual account and defined benefit components.</T3>The portion of a plan that provides benefits that are based solelyon the contributions and other amounts allocated to employees' individualaccounts (determined in accordance with section 414(i)) and the portionof the plan that provides benefits that are not based solely on the contributionsand other amounts allocated to employees' individual accounts are to betreated as separate plans for purposes of section 401(a)(26). Thus, forexample, a plan that provides benefits partly on the basis of defined benefitsand partly on the basis of employees' individual accounts is to be treatedas including both an individual account plan (with respect to those benefitsbased solely on employees' individual accounts) and a defined benefit plan(with respect to those benefits that are not based solely on employees'individual accounts), each of which must separately satisfy section 401(a)(26).(2) <T3>Plans benefiting collective bargaining employees. </T3>An employermay treat the portion of a plan that benefits employees who are includedin a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement andthe portion of a plan that benefits employees who are not included in sucha collective bargaining unit as separate plans for purposes of section401(a)(26). Thus, for example, if a plan benefits employees who are includedin collective bargaining unit A and employees who are not included in anycollective bargaining unit, the employer may treat such plan as two separateplans for purposes of section 401(a)(26), even if all of such employeesbenefit under identical current benefit structures. This paragraph (c)(2)applies separately with respect to each collective bargaining agreement.Thus, for example, the portion of a plan that benefits employees includedin a unit of employees covered by one collective bargaining agreement maybe treated as a plan that is separate from the portion of the plan thatbenefits employees included in a unit of employees covered by another collectivebargaining agreement. (3) <T3>ESOPS. </T3>The portion of a plan that is an employee stock ownershipplan described in section 4975(e)(7) (an ESOP) and the portion of suchplan that is not an ESOP are to be treated as separate plans for purposesof section 401(a)(26). An employer may treat the rule in this paragraph(c)(3) as effective for plan years commencing on or after January 1, 1990.(4) <T3>Plans benefiting otherwise excludable employees. </T3>If, in accordancewith andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-4(b)(1)(ii), an employer elects to apply section401(a)(26) separately to the portion of a plan that benefits only employeeswho have failed to satisfy the highest minimum age and/or service conditionspermissible under section 410(a)(1), such portion is to be treated as aseparate plan for purposes of section 401(a)(26). (5) <T3>Plans maintained by more than one employer_</T3>(i) <T3>Multiple employer plans. </T3>If a plan benefits employees of morethan one employer and such employees are not included in a unit of employeescovered by one or more collective bargaining agreements (a multiple employerplan), the plan is to be treated as comprising separate plans each of whichis maintained by a separate employer and must separately satisfy section401(a)(26) by reference only to such employer's employees. (ii) <T3>Multiemployer plans. </T3>The portion of a multiemployer plan thatbenefits employees who are included in one or more units of employees coveredby one or more collective bargaining agreements and the portion of suchplan that benefits employees who are not included in a unit of employeescovered pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement are to be treatedas separate plans for purposes of section 401(a)(26). See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-1(d)(2)for a multiemployer plan exception. The portion of a multiemployer planthat benefits employees who are not included in a unit of employees coveredby a collective bargaining agreement is to be treated as plan maintainedby one or more employers, depending on whether such employees are employedby one or more employers. See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-1(d)(2)(ii) for purposesof determining whether an employee is included in a unit of employees coveredpursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (d) <T3>Current benefit structures_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>One or more current benefit structures exist wheneverthere is an allocation or benefit accrual whether as a result of additionalyears of service, changes in compensation, or other factors. Any such increasesare treated as benefits attributable to the year of service in which theyaccrue. A single current benefit structure exists with respect to eachportion of a uniform benefit formula (under which contributions and forfeituresare allocated with respect to a plan year in a defined contribution planor under which an employee's benefit attributable to the current year ofservice is determined in a defined benefit plan) to the extent that subsidies,optional forms of benefits, rights and features (e.g. social security supplements,ancillary benefits, loans and investment options) are provided on a uniformbasis to employees eligible to participate under such formula. To the extentthat subsidies, optional forms of benefits, rights and features are notprovided on a uniform basis, two or more single current structures exist.An otherwise single current benefit structure comprises separate currentbenefit structures to the extent it is included in separate plans (as determinedunder paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section). See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-8(b)(1)for a transition rule with respect to the provisions taken into accountin identifying a plan's current benefit structures for plan years beginningbefore January 1, 1990. (2) <T3>Uniform formula</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>In determining whether a benefit formula is uniformall features in the plan affecting the availability of the benefit andthe amount of benefits or contributions accrued must be taken into account.Factors taken into account in making this determination include the rateof accrual in a defined benefit plan and the basis of and conditions tocontributions or benefits (e.g. hour-of-service minimums, year-of-servicerequirements and limits, compensation definitions, benefit limits, employmentconditions, vesting schedules, levels of mandatory employee contributions,eligibility requirements for participation). (ii) <T3>Difference in rates of allocation or benefit accrual. </T3>In general,differences in rates of allocations or benefit accruals for differencesin participants under plan will result in separate benefit structures underthe plan. However, a formula does not fail to be a uniform formula merelybecause the rate of contribution allocations or benefit accruals (expressedas percentages of compensation or flat dollar amounts) varies, on a uniformbasis for all employees, with years of service or participation (as, forexample, in a formula that is backloaded to the extent permitted undersection 411(b)(1)(B)) or varies with entry age (as, for example, with aformula under which benefits accrue under the fractional rule of section411(b)(1)(C)). Similarly, a formula does not fail to be uniform merelybecause the rate at which benefits accrue above a stated compensation leveldiffers from the rate at which benefits accrue below such level, withoutregard to whether such formula satisfies the requirements of section 401(l).A formula does not fail to be a uniform formula merely because it providesthat an employee will receive the greatest contribution allocation or benefitaccrual produced under one of several formulas that are reasonably availableto all employees covered by the formula. In addition, a formula does notfail to be uniform merely because it provides for an allocation on thebasis of account balances.(iii) <T3>Permitted disparity. </T3>A benefit formula under a plan does not failto be uniform merely because of differences under the formula that arepermissible under section 401(l) and, under such rules, are treated asuniform. Thus, for example, if the rates under a defined benefit excessplan's benefit formulas differ based solely on employees' social securityretirement ages such that the disparities under such formulas are treatedas uniform under section 401(l), such differences are disregarded in determiningwhether the benfit formulas constitute one or more current benefit structures.(3) <T3>Uniform subsidies, optional forms of benefits, rights and features_</T3>(i)<T3>In general. </T3>Subsidies, optional forms of benefit, right and featureis provided on a uniform basis to all participants eligible to benefitunder such benefit formula. A subsidy, optional form of benefit, rightand feature is provided on a uniform basis only if it is identical withrespect to its terms (i.e. frequency of use, dollar limitations, actuarialassumptions). In addition, in the case of a subsidy, optional form of benefit,right or feature, the availability of which is conditioned, the subsidy,optional form of benefit, right or feature is provided on a uniform basisonly with respect to those participants with respect to whom the conditionsare identical and who satisfy the conditions.(ii) <T3>Conditions on availability_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Whether a participant satisfies conditions on availabilityof a subsidy, optional form of benefit, right or feature is determinedon the basis of the current facts and circumstances with respect to theemployee (e.g. the employee's current job classification, division of employmentor net worth). Thus, for example, the fact that an employee may, in thefuture satisfy a condition on availability generally does not cause theconditioned benefit, right or feature to be treated as currently availableto such employee. However, to the extent provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) and subject to the limitations in paragraph (d)(12) with respectto individualized formulas, certain conditions on availability are treatedas currently satisfied for purposes of determining whether a subsidy, optionalform of benefit, right or feature is provided on a uniform basis.(B) <T3>Age and service conditions. </T3>In general, for purposes of the rulesin this paragrpah (d)(3), age conditions and service conditions are treatedas satisfied. This exception is not applicable to age or service conditionswith respect to optional forms of benefit, rights and features that mustbe satisfied within a specified period of time, other than terminationof employment. However, availability of an optional form of benefit, rightor feature subject to such a limited age or service condition may be determinedby projecting the age and service of employees to the last date on whichsuch formula, right or feature is available under the plan. An employer'sability to project age and service to the last date on which the formula,right or feature is available under the plan is not cut off by a plan terminationoccurring prior to that date.

Similarly, a plan (or portion thereof) that includes matching contributionssubject to section 401(m) includes separate current benefit structuresto the extent that the matching contributions are not allocated under auniform formula with respect to employees' elective contributions or after-taxemployee contributions.(ii) <T3>Elective contributions, employee contributions and matching contributions.</T3>The portion of a plan to which elective contributions under a qualifiedcash or deferred arrangement (defined under section 401(k)) may be madeis a separate benefit structure for purposes of section 401(a)(26).

Finally, the portion of a plan to which matching contributionssubject to section 401(m) may be made is a separate benefit structure forpurposes of section 401(a)(26).(iii) <T3>Exceptions.</T3> A plan (or portion thereof) that is subject to section401(k) or 401(m) does not include separate current benefit structures merelybecause of differences in the allocation of elective contributions or after-taxemployee contributions and matching contributions that are solely the resultof employees' elections. Similarly, a plan (or portion thereof) that issubject to section 401(k) or 401(m) does not comprise separate currentbenefit structures merely because the plan imposes uniform limits on theelective contributions or employee contributions that may be made by highlycompensated employees to facilitate compliance with the applicable nondiscriminationrules or imposes uniform limits on the elective contributions that anyemployee can make to assure compliance with the limits under section 402(g)and section 415. Also, separate current benefit structure do not arisemerely because of the allocation of qualified nonelective contributionsto some or all nonhighly compensated employees eligible under the plan(or portion thereof) subject to section 401(k) or 401(m) if such nonelectivecontributions both are taken into account for purposes of determining whetherelective contributions, employee contributions, or matching contributionssatisfy the requirements of section 401(k) or 401(m), as applicable, andare not taken into account in determining whether any other employer contributionssatisfy sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) (other than section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)).The preceding sentence applies with respect to allocations of qualifiednonelective contributions to nonhighly compensated employees without regardto whether such allocations are under a uniform formula.(5) <T3>Top-heavy contributions and benefits</T3>_(i)<T3> General rule.</T3> A plan does not fail to provide a single currentbenefit structure merely because the plan includes a formula that providesnon-key employees with contributions or benefits required under section416.(ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> This paragraph (d)(5) can be illustrated by the followingexamples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Assume that a defined benefit plan provides that allemployees will receive a normal retirement benefit of 1 percent times yearsof service times final average compensation. However, the plan also providesthat non-key employees who perform at least 1000 hours of service willreceive a benefit of at least 2 percent times top-heavy years of service(not in excess of 10 years of service) times top-heavy compensation. Indetermining this plan's current benefit structures, the portion of thebenefit formula that is required to comply with section 416 may be disregarded.Thus, this plan has one current benefit structure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2</T3>. Assume the same facts set forth in <T3>Example 1,</T3> except that the plan provides that, whether or notthe plan is top-heavy, all employees (rather than only non-key employees)who perform at least 1000 hours of service will receive a benefit of atleast 2 percent times years of service (Not in excess of 10 years) timescompensation. The portion of the formula that reflects the top-heavy requirementsmust be taken into account in determining this plan's current benefit structure.In this case, the plan is treated as including only one current benefitstructure under which each employee earns the greater benefit under thetwo parts of the formula.</ITAG>(6) <T3>Contributions for participants who are permanently and totally disabled.</T3>A plan does not fail to provide a single current benefit structure merelybecause the plan includes a formula that uniformly provides nonhighly compensatedemployees with contributions pursuant to the provisions of section 415(c)(3)(C).(7) <T3>Grandfathered benefits</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> A defined benefit plan's benefit formula does notfail to be a single current benefit structure merely because such formulaprovides that an employee will not accrue additional benefits under thecurrent portion of the benefit formula until such employee has accruedunder such portion a benefit in excess of such employee's benefit underone or more formulas in effect for prior years that are based wholly onprior years. Such prior benefit may have accrued under the same or a separateplan and may relate to service with the same or prior employers. Benefitsfail to be treated as based wholly on prior years if they are based, directlyor indirectly, on compensation earned after such prior years (includingcompensation earned in in the current year). Benefits do not fail to betreated as based wholly on prior years merely because such benefits (e.g.,early retirement benefits) are subject to an age or years-of-service conditionand, in applying such condition or conditions, the current and prior yearsare taken into account. In addition, if a plan eliminates a right or feature(e.g., single sum distribution option or loan) with respect to future benefits,and provides that such right or feature remains available with respectto benefits accrued as of the date of elimination, the plan's grandfatherof such right or feature with respect to prior accrued benefits does notcreate separate current benefit structures.(ii) This paragraph (d)(7) can be illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Assume that an employer maintains a defined benefitplan under which an employee receives a benefit equal to 2 percent timesyears of service times final average compensation. Effective January 1,1990, the plan is amended to provide that an employee receives the greaterof (A) 2 percent times years of service up to January 1, 1990, times finalaverage compensation as of December 31, 1989, and (ii) 1\1/2\ percent timesall years of service times final average compensation as of separationfrom service. Even though the employees with service prior to 1990, area closed group and may not accrue additional benefits under this two-partformula for one or more years after 1989 and the other employees will benefitimmediately and in full under the latter part of the formula, this is auniform formula that is a single current benefit structure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Assume the same facts set forth in <T3>Example 1,</T3> except that final average compensation under the formerpart of the two-part formula is determined based on compensation as ofseparation from service (i.e., final average compensation is determinedby reference to compensation after 1989). Because employees with serviceprior to 1990, may accrue additional benefits under the former part ofthe formula, this formula comprises two current benefit structures, onefor employees with pre-1990 service and one for employees without any pre-1990service.</ITAG>(8) <T3>Benefit offset arrangements_</T3>(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> A plan's contribution or benefit formula that providesfor a benefit under the positive portion of the formula that is offsetor reduced by contributions or benefits under another plan maintained bythe same employer does not fail to comprise a single current benefit structureto the extent that all of the conditions of paragraph (d)(8)(i)(A) through(d)(8)(i)(C) of this section are satisfied. To the extent that these conditionsare not satisfied, the contribution or benefit formula will not be treatedas uniform and will comprise two or more current benefit structures. SeeandSection; 1.401(a)(26)-3(b)(6) for the determination of who is benefitingunder a current benefit structure that includes an offset or reduction.(A) <T3>Offset condition.</T3> This condition is satisfied only if the formulabeing treated provides that contributions or benefits under its positiveportion are offset or reduced by contributions or benefits accrued underanother plan maintained by the same employer, and the contributions orbenefits used to offset or reduce the contributions or benefits under thepositive portion of the formula being tested were originally accrued undersuch other plan (or a predecessor plan). Thus, contributions or benefitstransferred or rolled over to the other plan generally may not be usedto offset the benefit under the positive portion of the formula being tested.(B) <T3>Benefiting condition.</T3> This condition is satisfied only if theemployees who benefit under the formula being tested also benefit, withrespect to those contributions or benefits that are used to offset or reducecontributions or benefits under the formula being tested, under the otherplan on a reasonable and uniform basis. If, with respect to employees whobenefit under the formula being tested, some employees benefit and someemployees do not benefit under the other plan, the formula being testedfails to be a single current benefit structure. Similarly, employees underthe formula being tested do not benefit under the other plan on a reasonableand uniform basis if, for any year, the contributions or benefits usedto offset or reduce contributions or benefits under the formula being testedare attributable to a benefit structure that is not uniform with respectto all such employees. Finally, employees do not benefit on a reasonableor uniform basis under the other plan if the method and assumptions forcalculating the extent to which contributions or benefits under the otherplan offset or reduce contributions or benefits under the formula beingtested are not uniform with respect to such employees.(C) <T3>Anti-multiple use condition.</T3> This condition is satisfied onlyif the contributions or benefits under the plan that are used to offsetor reduce the contributions or benefits under the formula being testedare not used to offset or reduce contributions or benefits under any otherplan or any other formula.(D) <T3>Examples.</T3> This paragraph (d)(8) can be illustrated by the followingexamples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Assume that all 100 active employees in defined benefitplan A benefit under a benefit formula that provides a benefit equal to1\1/2\ percent times years of service times final average compensation.However, with respect to 30 active employees, the benefit under this positivebenefit of the formula is offset by the benefit under a single formulain plan B of the employer. With respect to another 25 active employees,the positive plan A benefit is offset by the benefit under a separate formulain plan C, and with respect to the remaining 45 participants, the positiveplan A benefit is not offset by any other benefit. The benefit formulain plan A comprises three separate current benefit structures for purposesof section 401(a)(26).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Employer X, a partnership with two partners and sevencommon law employees, maintains two defined benefit plans (X and Y) andone defined contribution plan (Z). Partner X and the seven employees participatein defined benefit plan X, which has a single benefit formula that providesfor an offset by any benefit provided under defined contribution plan Z.Partner Y and the seven employees participate in defined benefit plan Y,which has a single benefit formula (different from plan X's formula) thatalso provides for an offset by any benefit provided under plan Z. The sevenemployees (but not the partners) also participate in plan Z, which providesa uniform contribution allocation formula for all participants. Plans Xand Y violate both the benefiting condition and the anti-multiple use condition.For both reasons, plans X and Y each provide two separate benefit structures,one for the participating partner and another for the seven employees.</ITAG>(9) <T3>Exception for certain section 414(n) recipient employers. </T3>Forpurposes of the benefit-offset rule in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section, an employer-recipient within the meaning of section 414 (n) and (o) thatmaintains a defined contribution plan covering leased employees (whichemployees are treated as employees of such employer-recipient within themeaning of section 414(n)92) and 414(o)(2)) that is offset or reduced bycontributions to defined contribution plan maintained by the leasing organizationmay treat such contributions as contributions to a plan maintained by therecipient organization for purposes of this paragraph (d)(8)(i)(A) andmay treat employees of the recipient organization as benefiting under theplan of the leasing organization for purposes of this paragraph (d)(8)(i)(B)only if the following requirements are satisfied: The contribution relateto service with the recipient organization; the contributions are madeto a money purchase plan that would be a safe-harbor plan within the meaningof section 414(n)(5) without regard to the 20-percent requirement applicableto such determination; and, the requirements in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(A)through (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section are otherwise satisfied with respectto such benefit offset arrangement. In applying the requirements of paragraph(d)(8)(i)(B) of this section, employees of the recipient who are not leasedfrom the leasing organizations are not required to benefit under the planof the leasing organization. (10) <T3>Inactive benefit formulas_(i) </T3><T3>General rule. </T3>If a plan includes a benefit formula but no employeeis currently eligible to accrue any additional benefits under the formula,such formula is not a current benefit structure under the plan. Similarly,if a plan includes a benefit formula with respect to which one or moreemployees are eligible, but the benefit formula does not provide any additionalbenefit to such employees, such formula is not a current benefit structure.(ii) <T3>Certain profit-sharing plans. </T3>A profit-sharing plan or stock bonusplan does not fail to have a current benefit structure merely because thereis no allocation in the current year because the employer maintaining theplan fails to make a contribution. Any employee covered by such a profit-sharingor stock bonus plan is treated as benefiting under a current benefit structurein the profit-sharing plan for a plan year if such employee both satisfiesall of the applicable conditions to receiving a maximum contribution allocationunder such current benefit structure for such year and fails to receivesuch allocation merely because the employer fails to make a contributionto the plan for such year and there are no forfeited amounts for reallocationfor such year. (11) <T3>Other arrangements that create separate current benefit structures_</T3>(i)<T3> In general. </T3>If, under all the facts and circumstances, an arrangement(either under or outside the plan) has the effect of modifying any featureunder the plan taken into account in determining an employee's benefit,providing any employee with any priority or greater interest in a portionof the assets in the plan, or linking any financial matter involving anemployee to all or a portion of the assets in the plan in a way that hasthe effect of creating separate accounts, such arrangement will be treatedas creating a separate current benefit structure within the plan. However,separate current benefit structures do not arise merely because a partnershipagreement provides for allocation of the cost of funding a defined benefitplan or the allocation of surplus assets upon termination of such planamong partners in proportion to their partnership interest. (ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate certain situationsin which other arrangements will or will not be treated as creating separeatebenefit structures:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Employer A maintains a defined benefit plan under whicheach highly compensated employee has the discretion and authority to directthe investment of a portion of the plan's assets that represent the accumulatedcontributions with respect to that employee's plan benefits. In addition,by agreement outside the plan, if the product of the employee's investmentdirection exceeds the value needed to fund that employee's benefits, EmployerA agrees to make a special payment to the participant. In this case, eachseparate portion of the pool of assets over which an employee has investmentauthority is considered a separate current benefit structure for such employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>Employer B is a partnership that maintains a definedbenefit plan. Under the partnership agreement, the cost of providing thecurrent benefit accrual for each partner is allocated to such partner indetermining such partner's distributive share of profit or loss. This plandoes not include separate plans merely because of this arrangement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3. </T3>Employer C is a partnership that maintains a definedbenefit plan. The partnership agreement provides that, upon terminationof the plan, a special allocation is to be made to a partner representingthe amount of the excess plan assets in proportion to such partner's accruedbenefit under the plan. This arrangement results in the defined benefitplan being treated as including a separate current benefit structure foreach partner. The same agreement modified to allocate excess plan assetsafter reversion to the partnership on the basis of partnership share doesnot create a separate benefit structure with respect to the partner.</ITAG>(12) <T3>Examples</T3>_(i) <T3>Defined contribution plans. </T3>The following examples illustratethe meaning of current benefit structure with respect to defined contributionplans.

Participants may make employee contributions of 0 percent,1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent of compensation. Plan K does not separatelyaccount for the employee contributions. Because the special rule for planssubject to section 401(m) does not apply with respect to the employee contributionsunder plan K, such plan has three current benefit structures (i.e., employeecontributions of 1 percent, 2 percent, and 3 percent). (In accordance withandSection; 1.401(a)(26)-1(c)(1), these three current benefit structuresmay be restructured as three current benefit structures, each one providingfor an employee contribution of 1 percent.)<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 12. </T3>Plan L is a defined benefit plan under which all participantsearn an annual benefit for life, commencing at age 65, equal to 1 percenttimes years of service times final average compensation. In January 1990,the employer amends the plan to provide that any employee who is at least55 years of age, has at least 25 years of service, and separates from servicebetween July 1 and October 1 of 1990, may receive an unreduced annual benefitcommencing upon separation from service. Plan L has two current benefitstructures for 1990.</ITAG>(13) <T3>Retroactive benefits. </T3>A benefit increase provided with respectto active employees in the current year is one or more current benefitstructures even if the benefit increase is based on prior years of service.Similarly, a benefit increase provided to former employees (including,for example, ad hoc cost-of-living increases) is one or more current benefitstructures for the year in which the increase is provided. Also, a provisionthat provides for the allocation, among employees under a terminating definedbenefit plan, of assets in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy allof the plan's liabilities is one or more current benefit structures inthe year of allocation, depending on the uniformity and characteristicsof the allocation formula. A formula providing a retroactive benefit increasethat differs with respect to years prior to a specified date (e.g., December31, 1989, or plan years beginning before the first plan year beginningafter December 31, 1989) and years after a specified date comprises twocurrent benefit structures because all portions of the formula are notreasonably available to all employees.(14) <T3>Individualized formulas</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>Notwithstanding the rules provided in this section,an otherwise uniform formula, subsidy, optional form of benefit, rightor feature may be treated as comprising separate current benefit structuresif, under the facts and circumstances, the formula, subsidy, optional formof benefit, right or feature is based on significantly individualized factorsor the effect of such formula, right or feature with respect to employees'allocation or benefit rates, or other rights under the plan is similarto the effect of separate formulas, rights or features.(ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> This paragraph (d)(14) may be illustrated by the followingexamples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Assume that an employer with 500 active employees maintainsa defined contribution plan under which contributions are allocated amongall of the employer's active employees based on their years of servicewith the employer. Under the allocation formula, each employee receivesa contribution allocation for a plan year equal to 5 percent of compensation,plus an additional 1 percent of compensation for each year of service withthe employer. The maximum allocation for any year is 20 percent of compensation.Because, in this case, the number of employees under the plan substantiallyexceeds the number of different allocation rates under the plan's allocationformula and all allocation rates are reasonably available to all employees,the facts and circumstances indicate that the plan's formula does not compriseseparate, individualized formulas. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Assume that an employer with 5 active employees maintainsa defined contribution plan under which contributions are allocated amongall of the active employees based on their years of service with the employer.Under the allocation formula, each employee with fewer than 10 years ofservice receives an allocation of 7 percent of compensation and each employeewith 10 or more years of service receives an allocation of 10 percent ofcompensation. One employee, who is the sole highly compensated employeeof the employer, has over 10 years of service; the other four employeeseach have fewer than 5 years of service. In addition, no employees haveseparated from service with more than 10 years of service and, based onthe facts and circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect that the fouremployees will remain with the employer for a full 10 years of service.Thus, these facts and circumstances indicate that this allocation formulacomprises two individualized formulas and accordingly is treated as twoseparate current benefit structures.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Restructuring current benefit formulas_</T3>(1) <T3>General rule.</T3> If two or more current benefit structures undera plan would constitute a single structure but for differences in the benefitformulas, and the formulas are identical in all respects except that therates of accrual or contribution allocation are different (thus, for example,the formulas use the same compensation base, credit service in the samemanner and have the same vesting schedule), an employer may restructurethe benefit structures as two or more separate benefit structures, oneincluding the portion of the formulas that is common to each of the benefitstructures, and one or more benefit structures including the portion ofthe formula that is not common to each of the original benefit structures.For purposes of this paragraph (e), the common or lesser included benefitformula within a plan must be treated as a single current benefit structurewith respect to such plan and each restructured benefit structure mustbe uniform with respect to the benefit formula. Thus, if a plan that isotherwise uniform with respect to all benefits, rights and features, providesa benefit of 50% final average pay for division A, 55% final average payfor division B, and 60% final average pay for division C, restructuringunder this rule would result in a benefit structure of 50% of final averagepay for employees of divisions A, B and C, 5% of final average pay foremployees of division B and C, and 5% of final average pay for employeesof division C. Restructuring under this paragraph (e) does not requirethat the employer actually amend a plan's provisions to reflect the restructuring.Rather, restructuring is merely one method of testing current benefit structuresunder section 401(a)(26). See andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-1(c)(1) for rulesabout testing two or more restructured current benefit formulas.(2) <T3>Examples.</T3> The rule in this paragraph (e) may be illustrated bythe following examples: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Assume that a defined benefit plan includes two currentbenefit formulas_one of which benefits the 300 active employees of divisionA and provides a benefit of 1\1/4\ percent times years of service timesfinal average compensation, and the other of which benefits the 30 activeemployees of division B and provides a benefit of 1 percent times yearsof service times final average compensation. Solely for purposes of testingthese current benefit structures under section 401(a)(26), such formulasmay be restructured as one restructured current benefit formula providinga benefit of 1 percent times years of service times final average compensation(and benefits all 330 active employees of divisions A and B), and one restructuredcurrent benefit formula providing a benefit of \1/4\ percent times yearsof service times final average compensation (and benefits division A's300 active employees). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>Employer B maintains a defined contribution plan thatprovides a 5 percent contribution for 100 Division A employees, and a 4percent contribution for 30 Division B employees. All other rights andfeatures under the plan are identical with respect to all employees. Solelyfor purposes of testing these current benefit formulas under section 401(a)(26),such formulas may be restructured the following two benefit formulas: Aseparate formula providing a 4 percent contribution to the 100 DivisionA employees and the 30 Division B employees, and a separate formula providingan additional 1 percent contribution to the 100 Division A employees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3. </T3>Employer C maintains a plan including a qualified cashor deferred arrangement in which both 70 division A employees and 30 divisionB employees are eligible to participate. Under the plan, the employer makesa matching contribution with respect to the first six percent of electivecontributions: In the case of Division A employees the employer matchingcontribution is 50 percent of an employee's elective contributions, inthe case of Division B employees, the employer matching contribution is30 percent of an employee's elective contributions. In all other respects,all employees have identical rights under the plan. The plan includes threeseparate benefit structures: a cash or deferred arrangement benefiting100 employees, a 50 percent matching arrangement benefiting 70 DivisionA employees, and a 30 percent matching arrangement benefiting 30 DivisionB employees. The 30 percent matching benefit structure fails to satisfysection 401(a)(26) because it benefits only 30 employees. The plan maybe restructured and treated as if it contained the following three separatebenefit formulas: a cash or deferred arrangement benefiting 100 employees,a 30 percent matching feature benefiting 100 employees (including the 30division B employees, and the 70 Division A employees), and an additional20 percent matching feature benefiting the 70 Division A employees. Asrestructured, all three separate structures benefit at least 50 employees,and thus satisfy section 401(a)(26). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4. </T3>Employer D maintains a defined benefit plan under which100 employees benefit. The plan provides a normal retirement benefit of2 percent of pay times final average compensation times years of service.All employees under the plan have identical rights except that the planprovides for an unreduced early retirement benefit for employees with atleast 20 years of service and such early retirement benefit is availableonly to a group of 80 employees. The plan contains two separate benefitstructures: one structure benefits 80 employees and includes the earlyretirement benefit, the second structure has no early retirement benefitand benefits 20 employees. The plan cannot be restructured and treatedas if it contained two separate benefit structures, one benefit structureincluding all rights and features under the plan that benefits all 100employees, and the other benefit structure including only the early retirementbenefit that benefits 80 employees because rights and features cannot berestructured. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 5. </T3>Employer E maintains a defined contribution plan providinga 6 percent contribution for 30 division A employees, and a 3 percent contributionfor 50 division B employees. The plan contains two separate benefit formulas,a 6 percent benefit formula, benefiting 30 employees, and a 3 percent benefitformula benefiting 50 employees. The 6 percent benefit formula fails tosatisfy section 401(a)(26). Assume that the 6 percent formula does notsatisfy the requirements of andSection;1.401(a)(26)^1(c)(4). The plan cannotbe restructured into benefit structures that satisfy 401(a)(26). The plancan be restructured into a 3 percent benefit formula that benefits all80 Division A and B employees, and a 3 percent benefit formula that benefits30 Division A employees. Under this restructuring, the latter 3 percentbenefit formula would fail to satisfy section 401(a)(26). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 6. </T3>Employer F maintains a defined benefit plan covering100 employees that provides a benefit equal to 1 percent of final averagecompensation times years of service to 50 category 1 employees, and a benefitequal to 2 percent times career average compensation times years of serviceto 50 category 2 employees. A lump sum distribution option is availableto 50 employees, including 25 category 1 employees and 25 category 2 employees.The plan includes four separate benefit structures: one benefiting 25 employeesunder the final average compensation formula who cannot receive a lumpsum; one benefiting 25 employees under the final average compensation formulawho may receive a lump sum; one benefiting 25 employees under the careeraverage compensation formula who cannot receive a lump sum; and one benefiting25 employees under the career average compensation formula who may receivea lump sum. The plan cannot be restructured in a manner that establishesthat the plan satisfies section 401(a)(26) even though 50 employees benefitunder the final average compensation formula and so under the career averagecompensation formula, and 50 employees may receive a lump sum. </ITAG>(f) <T3>Prior benefit structure. </T3>The prior benefit structure under a definedbenefit plan includes all benefit structures that, for prior years, were(or, prior to the first day for which section 401(a)(26) applies to suchplan, would have been) current benefit structures under the plan (or underany other plan) and are or were taken into account at any time in determiningany employee's benefit under the plan (including benefits originally accruedunder another plan). This is the case even if the plan's prior benefitstructure is identical to the plan's current benefit structure. Each definedbenefit plan has only one prior benefit structure and all accrued benefitsunder the plan as of the beginning of a plan year (including benefits rolledover or transferred to such plan) are included in such prior benefit structurefor such year. (g) <T3>Additional rules. </T3>The Commissioner may, only in revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability, prescribe such additionalguidance as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to the applicationof this section. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Employees who benefit under a plan and current benefit structure </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>An employee is treated as benefiting under a currentbenefit structure under a plan only in accordance with the rules of paragraph(b) of this section. Also, in certain situations, it is necessary to determinewhether an employee is benefiting under a plan (rather than under the plan'scurrent benefit structure). Such determination may be made only in accordancewith the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. (b) <T3>Benefiting under a current benefit structure</T3>_(1) <T3>Maximum benefit accrual rule</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b),an employee is treated as benefiting under a current benefit structurefor a plan year only if the employee actually accrues the maximum benefitthat is available to such employee under the current benefit structurefor such year. In the case of a defined contribution plan, an employeeis treated as accruing the maximum benefit under a current benefit structureonly if such employee actually receives the maximum contribution allocationthat is available to such employee under the current benefit structurefor such year. The maximum benefit or allocation under a current benefitstructure for an employee for a plan year is to be determined under thestructure by assuming that the employee satisfied all of the applicableaccrual or allocation conditions relating to the current year (e.g., hour-of-serviceor employment conditions, and mandatory employee contributions). Failureto receive a maximum contribution or benefit allocation that arises solelybecause of a uniform and otherwise permissible entry date provision undera plan will not result in an employee being treated as failing to benefitunder a current benefit structure. (ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following are examples of benefiting within themeaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>An employer maintains a defined benefit plan underwhich all active employees accrue a benefit equal to 2 percent times yearsof service times final average compensation by making a mandatory employeecontribution equal to 1 percent of compensation. Employees who fail tomake the mandatory employee contribution, and thus do not accrue the benefitunder the current benefit structure, are not treated as benefiting underthe current benefit structure for the year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>An employer maintains a defined benefit plan underwhich all employees who perform at least 1000 hours of service during theplan year accrue a benefit of 2 percent times years of service times finalaverage compensation for the year. Only those employees who perform atleast 1000 hours of service during the plan year are treated as benefitingunder the current benefit structure for the year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3. </T3>An employer maintains a defined contribution plan underwhich all employees who are employed by the employer on the last day ofthe plan year receive a 10 percent of compensation allocation under a currentbenefit structure. Only employees who are employed by the employer on thelast day of the plan year, and who thus receive an allocation, are treatedas benefiting under the current benefit structure for the year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4. </T3>Plan M is a defined benefit plan under which all employeesearn an annual benefit for life, commencing at age 65, equal to 1 percenttimes years of service times final average compensation. In January 1990,the employer amends the plan to provide that any employee who is at least55 years of age, has at least 25 years of service, and separates from servicebetween July 1 and October 1 of 1990, may receive an unreduced annual benefitcommencing upon separation from service. Plan M has two current benefitstructures for 1990. An employee who satisfies the applicable age and serviceeligibility conditions and thus who would receive the unreduced early retirementbenefit if such employee separated from service during the applicable windowperiod is treated as benefiting under the current benefit structure providingthe unreduced early retirment benefit, without regard to whether the employeeactually separates from service and receives the unreduced early retirementbenefit. </ITAG>(2) <T3>Partial benefit accruals</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>An employee is treated as benefiting under a currentbenefit structure under a defined benefit plan even though such employeefails to accrue the maximum benefit under the plan for the current yearof service, if such failure was merely because the employee performed fewerthan the required minimum number of hours of service for the maximum benefitfor the year and, instead, the employee accrued a pro rata portion of themaximum benefit for such year. For purposes of this rule, in determiningthe pro rata portion of the maximum benefit for an employee for a year,the maximum benefit for the year is the maximum benefit available underthe formula determined by assuming that all hour-of-service requirementsare satisfied. Also, the pro rata portion of this maximum benefit mustbe determined as if such maximum benefit were available for the lesserof the actual number of hours of service required under the plan or 2080hours of service.(ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> The following are examples of the partial benefit accrualrules of this paragraph (b)(2):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Defined benefit plan X's benefit formula provides thata participant who performs fewer than 1000 hours of service for a yeardoes not accrue any benefit for such year, a participant who performs atleast 2000 hours of service for a year accrues the maximum benefit forsuch year (i.e., 1 percent times final pay times years of service), anda participant who performs between 1000 and 2000 hours of service for aplan year accrues a partial benefit in such year based on a fraction, thenumerator of which is the number of hours performed by the participantand denominator of which is 200 hours. (An employee's pay is annualizedunder the plan formula.) Plan X has one current benefit structure. ParticipantA performs 900 hours of service for the year and thus does not accrue anybenefit under the plan for such year. Participant B performs 1000 hoursof service and, thus, accrues 50 percent of the maximum benefit. ParticipantC performs 1500 hours and thus accrues 75 percent of the maximum benefitfor the year. Participant D performs over 2000 hours and thus accrues themaximum benefit for the year. Participant A is treated as not benefitingunder the current benefit structure for such year, while participants B,C, and D are treated as having accrued the maximum benefit for the currentyear and thus as having benefited under the current benefit structure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example 1,</T3> except that the defined benefit plan's formula alsoprovides that each participant accrues a minimum benefit of \1/4\ percenttimes career average compensation times years of service regardless ofthe participant's number of hours of service for any year. Such formulacontinues to be a single current benefit structure because each participantwill accrue the greater of the benefit based on the participant's hoursof service (in excess of 1,000 hours) or the minimum \1/4\ percent benefit.Nevertheless, even if participant A accrues an additional benefit for thecurrent year, such participant did not accrue the maximum benefit and thusis not treated as benefiting for the year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3> Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example 1,</T3> except that the plan provides that a participant whoperforms at least 100 hours of service for a year will accrue a pro rataportion of the maximum benefit available under the formula, which is afull 1 percent for participants with at least 2000 hours. Participant Aperformed 900 hours of service and thus receives a benefit equal to 0.45percent times final average pay for the current year. Participant A thusmay be treated as benefiting under the plan's current benefit structure.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Section 401(k) and section 401(m).</T3> (i) An employee is treatedas benefiting under a current benefit structure that is subject to eithersection 401(k) or section 401(m) for a plan year only if such employeeis an eligible employee with respect to such current benefit structurefor such year. For example, an employee is treated as benefiting undera current benefit structure that is a qualified cash or deferred arrangementonly if the employee is an eligible employee with respect to such arrangementfor the year. This is the case without regard to whether the employee hasa benefit under the plan and without regard to whether the employee makeselective contributions under the arrangement for such year. Similarly,an employee is treated as benefiting under a current benefit structureof a plan that accepts after-tax employee contributions subject to section401(m) only if such employee is an eligible employee with respect to suchcurrent benefit structure for such year.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>Example.</T3> Defined contribution plan Z permits eligible employeesto make after-tax employee contributions and provides for employer matchingcontributions equal to employee contributions up to 6 percent of compensation.This plan has two current benefit structures. For the current year, employeeA is eligible to make employee contributions but declines to do so and,thus, is not credited with any employer matching contributions. EmployeeA may be treated as benefiting under both current benefit structures forthe year.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Section 415 limits.</T3> An employee may be treated as benefiting undera current benefit structure for a plan year if such employee both satisfiesall of the applicable conditions for accruing the maximum benefit underthe current benefit structure for such year and fails to accrue the maximumbenefit merely because of the section 415 limits on annual contributionsand benefits.(5) <T3>Certain plan limits.</T3> (i) An employee may be treated as benefitingunder a current benefit structure for a plan year if such employee bothsatisfies all of the applicable conditions to accruing the maximum benefitunder such current benefit structure for such year and fails to accruesuch maximum benefit merely because of a uniformly applicable benefit limitunder the plan's current benefit structure.(ii) The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (b)(5):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> Defined benefit plan Y has one current benefit structurethat provides for a an annual benefit for life equal to 1 percent timesfinal average compensation times years of service. However, only an employee'sfirst 30 years for service are taken into account under this formula. Forthe current year, employee Z is age 60 and has performed over 30 yearsof service. Employee Z may be treated as benefiting under the current benefitstructure for the year even though Z is not credited with an additionalyear under the plan's current benefit structure because of the 30-yearlimit on years of service taken into account under plan.</ITAG>(6) <T3>Benefit offset arrangements.</T3> In the case of a current benefitstructure under a plan that provides that the benefit determined underthe positive portion of the formula is offset or reduced by contributionsor benefits under another plan, an employee is treated as accruing themaximum benefit under such structure for a plan year only if the currentbenefit structure that includes an offset or reduction for other benefitssatisfies andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2(d)(8), and the employee would have accruedthe maximum benefit if the offset or reduction portion of the benefit formulawere disregarded.(7) <T3>Certain grandfathered benefits.</T3> An employee is treated as accruingthe maximum benefit under a current benefit structure under a defined benefitplan that includes an offset or reduction for grandfathered benefits andsatisfies andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2(d)(7)(i) only if such employee accruesthe maximum benefit under such current benefit structure for such year,or if such employee would have accrued the maximum benefit if the offsetor reduction portion of the benefit formula were disregarded.(c) <T3>Benefiting under a plan.</T3> An employee is treated as benefitingunder a plan for a plan year only if the employee has a benefit under theplan at some time during the year. An employee who does not have a benefitunder a plan at any time during the year is not treated as benefiting underthe plan for such year. This is the case even if the employee is eligibleto (but does not) accrue a benefit for the plan year and without regardto the reason for the failure of an employee to accrue a benefit. Thus,for example, an employee who, at the beginning of a plan year, does nothave an accrued benefit will be treated as benefiting under the plan onlyif, during such year, the employee actually accrues a benefit under theplan. Similarly, an employee who, as of the beginning of a plan year, hasan accrued benefit under a plan is treated as benefiting under the planfor the plan year even though such employee does not accrue, or is noteligible to accrue, an additional benefit under the plan for such year.An employee who receives a total distribution of his benefit during a planyear is treated as benefiting under the plan for such year.(d) <T3>Additional rules.</T3> The Commissioner may, only in revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability, prescribe such additionalguidance as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to the applicationof this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Excludable employees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Except as specifically provided otherwise in thissection, in applying section 401(a)(26) with respect to either active employees,former employees, or both active and former employees, as applicable, allactive employees (other than excludable active employees described in paragraph(b) of this section), all former employees (other than excludable formeremployees described in paragraph (c) of this section), or both, as thecase may be, are to be taken into account.(2) <T3>Rules of application.</T3> Except as specifically provided otherwisein this section, the rules of this section are to be applied by referenceonly to the plan, or current benefit structures, or prior benefit structurebeing tested.

EmployerY has six employees, two of whom participate in Plan Y and four of whomhave not completed 1 year of service and are, therefore, not eligible toparticipate in Plan Y. The four employees who have not completed 1 yearof service are excludable employees and may be disregarded for purposesof applying the minimum participation test. Therefore, Plan Y meets theminimum participation requirements because both of the two employees whomust be considered are participants in Plan Y.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Employer X has 100 employees and maintains two plans,Plan 1 and Plan 2.

Each plan satisfies the 70-percent rationtest under section 410(b)(1)(B). In testing Plan 1 to determine whetherit satisfies the minimum participation requirements, the 20 employees notmeeting the minimum age and service requirement under Plan 1 are treatedas excludable employees to the same extent that they are treated as excludableemployees under section 410(b)(1). In testing Plan 2 to determine whetherit satisfies the minimum participation requirements, no employees are treatedas excludable employees because they are not treated as excludable employeesin testing Plan 2 under section 410(b)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3> Employer Z has 10 employees and maintains a definedbenefit plan that has no minimum age and service requirement. However,the plan provides for a lesser accrual for Z's 7 employees who have notmet the minimum age and service requirements described in section 410(a)(1)(A).The plan is treated as consisting of two separate benefit structures. Ingeneral, none of Z's employees would be treated as excludable in determiningwhether each separate benefit structure satisfies the minimum participationrequirements.

Excludable former employees may be disregardedin determining the number of former employees that is equal to 40 percentof the former employees of the employer for purposes of applying andSection;1.401(a)(26)-1(b)(2) and andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b).(1) <T3>Minimum age and service and collective bargaining rules. </T3>A formeremployee is an excludable former employee if the employee was excluded(or, if section 401(a)(26) was in effect, would have been excluded) fromconsideration under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (relating to employeesnot satisfying certain minimum age and service requirements) at all timesas an active employee or under paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relatingto certain employees covered pursuant to collective bargaining agreements)at substantially all times as an active employee.(2) <T3>Rules analogous to excludable active employee rules. </T3>A formeremployee is an excludable former employee if the former employee wouldqualify as an excludable active employee under rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii),(b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5) of this section if such former employee werean active employee. Thus, for example, a former employee who was a nonresidentalien and received no earned income (under section 911(d)(2)) from theemployer which constituted income from sources within the United States(within section 861(a)(3)) qualifies as an excludable former employee underthis test.(3) <T3>Vested accrued benefits eligible for mandatory distribution. </T3>Aformer employee is an excludable former employee if the present value ofthe former employee's vested accrued benefit is not in excess of $3,500.This determination is to be made in accordance with the rules of sections411(a)(11) and 417(e).(d) <T3>Special rule for governmental plans_(1) </T3><T3>Grandfathered participants. </T3>In the case of a governmental plan(within the meaning of section 414(d)) for plan years beginning beforeJanuary 1, 1993, an employee who became a plan participant before July15, 1988, may be treated as an excludable employee with respect to suchplan and the current and prior benefit structures included therein. Consequently,a governmental plan will be deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(26) with respectto such participants for such years, and such participants need not betaken into account in determining whether or not any plan satisfies section401(a)(26) with respect to other plan participants.(2) <T3>Special rule for certain police or firefighters. </T3>An employer mayapply section 401(a)(26) separately with respect to any classificationof qualified public safety employees for whom a separate plan is maintained.Consequently, all employees other than those in that classification ofqualified public safety employees are treated as excludable employees.Also, such employees need not be taken into account in determining whetheror not any plan satisfies section 401(a)(26) with respect to other planparticipants. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) the term ``qualifiedpublic safety employee'' means any employee of any police department orfire department organized and operated by a State or political subdivisionif the employee provides police protection, firefighting services, or emergencymedical services for any are a within the jurisdiction of such State orpolitical subdivision.(e) <T3>Additional rules. </T3>The Commissioner may, only in revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability, prescribe such additionalguidance as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to the applicationof this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Testing methods.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Testing period</T3>_(1) <T3>Each day of the plan year. </T3>A plan will satisfy section 401(a)(26)for a plan year only if such plan satisfies section 401(a)(26) on eachday on the plan year.

For example, if, in accordance with the minimum employeecoverage test of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, at least 100 employeeshave greater than de minimis accrued benefits under a defined benefit planand the three highly compensated employees with the largest benefits underthe plan do not have more than 25 percent of the total benefits under theplan, the defined benefit plan's prior benefit structure satisfies thisparagraph (b).

If the plan determines benefits based on careeraverage compensation, the minimum current accrual rate for a plan yearis 1.1 percent times career average compensation.(<T3>2</T3>) In the case of a current benefit structure that provides employeeswith a flat accrued benefit (expressed as a percentage of compensation)that employees accrue over their years of participation, the minimum currentaccrual rate for a plan year is the annual rate resulting for such employeeunder a formula that provides a flat accrued benefit at normal retirementage of either 30 percent of final average compensation or 45 percent ofcareer average compensation, depending on the compensation base on whichthe plan benefits are determined, accrued on a level basis over all yearsof plan participation.(E) <T3>Compensation.</T3> (<T3>1</T3>) A plan that determines benefits based on the highest averageannual compensation averaged over a specified period not exceeding 5 consecutiveyears (or a participant's entire period of service for the employer ifshorter than such specified period) shall be considered to base benefitson final average compensation and a plan that determines benefits basedon average annual compensation averaged over a specified period exceeding5 consecutive years (or a participant's entire period of service for theemployer, if shorter than such specified period) shall be considered tobase benefits on career average compensation.(<T3>2</T3>) Compensation shall be compensation as defined under the plan,provided that such definition is reasonable and is nondiscriminatory undersection 414(s). A definition of compensation that is significantly lessinclusive than the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken intoaccount under section 414(s) and the regulations thereunder is not reasonable.In addition, a definition of compensation is not reasonable if it providesthat compensation is a uniform percentage of a basic definition of compensationunder section 414(s) and the regulations thereunder (e.g., 95 percent ofW-2 compensation). For purposes of determining final average compensationunder this rule, compensation for years commencing prior to January 1,1989, may be defined as compensation taken into account under the planin such year.(iii) <T3>Nondecreasing benefit structure test</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> A plan satisifies this test for a plan year only if,as of the close of such year, the hypothetical accrued benefits of at leastthe lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of the employer's activeemployees benefiting under one or more current benefit structures includedin the plan are equal to or greater than the employees' actual accruedbenefits under the plan. This test is satisfied only if the group of activeemployees with hypothetical accrued benefits equal to or greater than actualaccrued benefits includes the three highly compensated active employeesof the employer with the largest amounts of accrued benefits under theplan. If there are fewer than three highly compensated active employeeswith accrued benefits under the plan, all highly compensated active employeeswith accrued benefits under the plan must be among the employees with hypotheticalaccrued benefits equal to or greater than actual accrued benefits.(B) <T3>Deemed satisfaction of nondecreasing benefit structure test.</T3> Aplan that satisfies the nondecreasing benefit structure test in this paragraph(b)(2)(ii) for a plan year will be deemed to continue to satisfy such testwith respect to its prior benefit structure on an ongoing basis withoutany requirement for retesting as long as both the current benefit formulaand the rate of accrual relied on remain in effect and continue to providebenefit accruals to a group of employees that satisfies the requirementsof section 401(a)(26).(C) <T3>Hypothetical accrued benefit.</T3> An employee's hypothetical accruedbenefit as of the close of a plan year is computed by using only the currentbenefit structure applicable to such employee for such plan year and byassuming that such current benefit structure has been in effect for allyears through the close of such year. In making this determination of anemployee's hypothetical accrued benefit, an employee's actual accrued benefitunder the plan is disregarded. In addition, employees who do not have eithergreater than de minimus accrued benefits or greater that de minimis accruedbenefit rates under a plan are treated as not having any hypothetical accruedbenefit under the plan.(D) <T3>Examples.</T3> The following examples illustrate the rules of thisparagraph (b)(2)(iii):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Assume that an employer with 1,000 active employeeshas maintained a defined benefit plan for 20 years and that over 100 activeemployees currently benefit under the plan. During this entire period,the plan has had only one benefit structure_\1/2\ percent times years ofservice (not in excess of 30 years) times final average compensation. Inthis case, the hypothetical accrued benefit of each active employee benefitingunder the plan equals such employee's actual accrued benefit. Thus, thisdefined benefit plan provides current benefits to active employees thatare meaningful relative to the benefits accrued under the plan. If theemployer were to amend the plan to improve the current benefit structureby increasing the rate from \1/2\ to .6 percent, the plan would continueto provide benefits that are meaningful relative to the benefits accruedunder the plan. This would be the case without regard to whether the increasedrate applied to prior years of service under the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example 1</T3>, except that the employer amends the plan's formulafor future years of service by increasing the rate from \1/2\ to .6 percent,applying such higher rate to career average compensation (rather than finalaverage compensation), and eliminating the 30 years of service limit. Whetherthis new current benefit structure provides benefits that are meaningfulrelative to the benefits accrued under the plan under the nondecreasingbenefit structure test depends on whether there are at least 50 activeemployees with hypothetical accrued benefits (determined by applying thenew current benefit structure using career average compensation to thecurrent and all prior years) equal to or greater than actual accrued benefitsunder the plan.</ITAG>(iv) <T3>Minimum current benefit structure test</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> A plan satisfies this test for a plan year only if,as of the close of such year, at least the lesser of 50 active employeesor 40 percent of the employer's active employees benefiting under one ormore current benefit structures under the plan have future service benefitrates that are equal to or greater than the plan's minimum benefit rate(as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section).(B) <T3>Future service benefit rate. </T3>The future service benefit rate foran active employee is the hypothetical, projected accrued benefit (expressedas a percentage of compensation) that would be accrued under the currentbenefit structure over the employee's future years of service, dividedby such employee's future years of service under the plan. This determinationis to be made on a basis consistent with the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(B)of this section and by assuming that the employee commenced employmentand plan participation at the beginning of the current plan year, assumingno change in the employee's annual compensation and annual hours of serviceand projecting the employee's age and service from the beginning of thecurrent year to normal retirement age under the plan. This determinationis to be made without projecting any increase in the annual limit on contributionsand benefits under section 415. Also, in making this determination, thecurrent year is to be taken into account as a future year of service. Finally,employees who do not have either greater than de minimis accrued benefitsor greater than de minimis accrued benefit rates under a plan are treatedas not having any future service benefit rate under the plan.(C) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the rules of thisparagraph (b)(2)(iv):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Assume that an employer maintains a defined benefitplan that currently benefits 100 active employees.

The plan's minimum benefit rate for the plan is 1\1/10\percent times years of service times final average compensation. Basedon the ages of the active employees currently benefiting under the plan,60 of such employees have future service benefit rates of at least 1\1/10\percent times years of service times final average compensation. Thus,the benefits under the plan's current benefit structure are meaningfulrelative to the benefits accrued under the plan.</ITAG>(v) <T3>Benefit ratio test_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>A plan satisfies this test for a plan year only if,as of the close of such year, the sum of the accrued benefits of all activeemployees under the plan is less than 60 percent of the sum of the projectedaccrued benefits of all active employees benefiting under the plan, andthe plan satisfies the concentration test set forth in paragraph (b)(4)of this section.(B) <T3>Projected accrued benefit. </T3>An employee's projected accrued benefitis determined by projecting the employee's accrued benefit to which theemployee would be entitled at the plan's normal retirement age under thecurrent benefit structure applicable to such employee under the plan, expressedin the form of an annuity for the life of the employee and assuming nochange in the employee's annual compensation or in the annual hours ofservice. In determining an employee's projected accrued benefit under acurrent benefit structure, any change in such current benefit structure(e.g., a change in the accrual rate or in the definition of compensation)that does not currently apply to any individual who is or could be an employeeunder the current benefit structure is disregarded. This determinationis to be made without projecting any increase in the annual limit on contributionsand benefits under section 415. Also, in making this determination, thecurrent year is to be taken into account. Thus, for example, in the caseof an employee whose current age is equal to or greater than normal retirementage, the employee's projected accrued benefit includes the accrued benefitattributable to the current year of service. Finally, employees who donot have either greater than de minimis accrued benefits or greater thande minimis accrued benefit rates under a plan are treated as not havingany projected accrued benefit under the plan.(C) <T3>Example. </T3>The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph(b)(2)(v):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Assume that an employer maintains a defined benefit planthat currently benefits 100 active employees. During its 20 prior yearsof existence, the plan has had many different benefit structures. In general,the benefit structures for prior years were richer than the current benefitstructure, which provides a benefit of 1 percent times years of servicetimes career average compensation. Also, for nearly all prior years, onlyabout 10 active employees benefited under the plan for any year. In thecurrent year, the plan benefits many more, generally younger employees.Because of the significant increase in the number of younger employeesbenefiting under the plan and in spite of the reduction in the plan's benefitstructure, the sum of the accrued benefits of all active employees underthe plan is less than 60 percent of the sum of the projected accrued benefitsfor all active employees under the plan. Thus, assuming that the plan alsosatisfies the concentration test set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of thissection, this plan's current benefit structure is meaningful relative tothe benefits under the plan.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Prior benefit structure requirement_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The group of active and former employees with meaningfulbenefits under a defined benefit plan satisfies section 401(a)(26) onlyif the plan satisfies at least one of tests set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)and (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

Before becoming a frozenplan, the plan had many different benefit structures. Currently, 100 activeand former employees have accrued benefits under the plan, and the planis not top-heavy. The plan's minimum benefit rate is 1.1 percent timesyears of service times final average compensation. Based on the accruedbenefits and years of service of the active and former employees with accruedbenefits under the plan, 58 of the 100 employees have accrued benefit ratesthat are greater than the minimum benefit rate.

This plan has had many different benefit structuresover its 25 years of existence. Assuming that at least 100 employees haveeither accrued benefits or accrued benefit rates that are greater thande minimis and the plan satisfies the concentration test of paragraph (b)(4)of this section, this plan satisfies the minimum employee coverage testof this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) and thus the plan's prior benefit structuresatisfies this paragraph (b) for the plan year.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Concentration test. </T3>(i) A plan satisfies this test for a planyear only if, as of the close of such year, the sum of the accrued benefitsunder the plan of the three employees who are or ever have been highlycompensated employees (either as active employees, former employees orboth) and who have the largest accrued benefits under the plan does notconstitute more than 25 percent of the sum of the accrued benefits of allemployees under the plan. If there are fewer than three employees withaccrued benefits under the plan who are or ever have been highly compensatedemployees, this determination is to be made by reference to all employeeswith accrued benefits under the plan who are or ever have been highly compensatedemployees. This test is applied by taking into account all active and formeremployees with benefits under the plan.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>Example. </T3>Assume that an employer maintains a frozen defined benefitplan under which 125 active and former employees have accrued benefitsthat are more than de minimis accrued benefits. However, because for itsfirst 15 years of existence this plan benefited only three highly compensatedemployees and coverage under the plan was expanded under a significantlyreduced benefit structure to 122 nonhighly compensated employees for onlya year before the plan was frozen, the sum of the accrued benefits of thethree highly compensated employees under the plan with the largest accruedbenefits constitute over 25 percent of the total accrued benefits underthe plan. This plan fails to satisfy the concentration test of this paragraph(b)(4).</ITAG>(c) <T3>Definitions for prior benefit structure tests_</T3>(1) <T3>Accrued benefit_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Solely for purposes of applying paragraph (b) of thissection, an employee's accrued benefit under a defined benefit plan isthe accrued benefit to which the employee is entitled commencing at theplan's normal retirement age, expressed as an annuity for such employeeslife. Thus, the accrued benefit, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1),is not adjusted to reflect benefit subsidies such as subsidized early retirementbenefits or subsidized joint and survivor annuity provisions, whether ornot the employee has satisfied the conditions for such benefit subsidy.(ii) <T3>Social security benefits and permitted disparity. </T3>An employeesaccrued benefit is to be determined based only on the employee's benefitunder the plan being tested, without regard to benefits provided undersocial security or similar Federal or state law and without regard to thepermitted disparity under section 401(l).(iii) <T3>Benefits under other plans.</T3> An employee's accrued benefit is basedonly on the employee's benefit under the plan being tested. Thus, for example,if benefits under the plan being tested are reduced by benefits under anotherplan maintained by the employer maintaining the plan being tested (e.g.,in a floor-offset arrangement) an employee's benefit under the plan beingtested is determined after the reduction by benefits provided under suchother plan. An employer may elect to disregard benefits under the planbeing tested if such benefits were rolled over (rather than transferred)to such plan and such benefits are treated as voluntary employee contributionsunder such plan. A plan may not disregard benefits that were transferredto the plan being tested from any other plan, including a plan of an unrelatedemployer; or benefits that were originally accrued under another plan thatwas merged with the plan being tested.(2) <T3>Minimum benefit rate_</T3>(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> The minimum benefit rate for a plan for a plan yearis determined in the following manner. If the highly compensated benefitrate for such year is equal to or greater than 1\1/2\ percent, the minimumbenefit rate is equal to 60 percent of the excess of the highly compensatedbenefit rate over \3/4\ percent. If the highly compensated benefit rateis less than 1\1/2\ percent, the minimum benefit rate is equal to 30 percentof the highly compensated benefit rate. If the minimum current accrualrate (determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) is less thanthe minimum benefit rate determined under the preceding two sentences,then the minimum benefit rate is such minimum current accrual rate.(ii) <T3>Highly compensated benefit rate.</T3> (A) The highly compensated benefitrate for a plan year is the highest of the accrued benefit rates for thethree active employees or former employees who are or ever were highlycompensated employees of the employer (either as active employees, formeremployees, or both) with the largest accrued benefits under the plan asof the close of the plan year. For purposes of this rule, an employer maylimit consideration of highly compensated former employees to those employeeswho had an hour of service with the employer during the plan year or anyof the immediately preceding five plan years. In addition, the employermay disregard highly compensated former employees who became former employeesprior to January 1, 1988. If more than three employees have the largestamounts of accrued benefits under the plan, all of such employees are takeninto account in determining the highest accrued benefit rate. If thereare fewer than three employees with accrued benefits under the plan whoare or ever were highly compensated employees, this determination is tobe made by reference to all employees with accrued benefits under the planwho are or ever were highly compensated employees. For purposes of applyingthis rule, employees who were highly compensated employees only for planyears ending before January 1, 1984, are not treated as highly compensatedemployees.(B) <T3>Example.</T3> Assume that an employer maintains a defined benefit planthat benefits five active employees and five former employees who are orever were highly compensated employees of the employer. To determine theplan's highly compensated benefit rate, the employer first must identifythe 3 of these 10 employees who have the largest accrued benefits underthe plan. Thus, if $90,000 is the largest accrued benefit for any employeeunder the plan and if 3 of the 10 employees each have a $90,000 accruedbenefit, these 3 employees are taken into account in determining the plan'shighly compensated benefit rate. If 4 of the 10 employees have $90,000accrued benefits, all 4 are taken into account. Similarly, if 2 of the10 employees have $90,000 accrued benefits and 2 of the 10 employees have$89,000 accrued benefits (the second largest amount under the plan), all4 of these employees are taken into account in determining the plan's highlycompensated benefit rate. Then, the employer must determine which of theseemployees who are taken into account has the highest accrued benefit rate,and such rate is the highly compensated benefit rate for the year.(3) <T3>Compensation.</T3> An employee's compensation is compensation as definedby the plan for purposes of determining employees' benefits. Such definitionmust satisfy section 414(s) and the regulations thereunder. In applyingthe rules of paragraph (b) of this section, a plan must use a uniform definitionof compensation and a uniform applicable period for determining compensation.Thus, for example, in applying the minimum current benefit structure testof paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, a uniform definition of compensationmust be used in determining the future service benefit rates and the minimumbenefit rate. Similarly, in applying the minimum accrued benefit test ofparagraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, a uniform definition of compensationmust be used in determining the accrued benefit rates and the minimum benefitrate. Also, a plan may not take into account, for any plan year, compensationin excess of the amount that may be taken into account for such year undersection 401(a)(17), and a plan may not project any increase in such amount.(d) <T3>Additional rules. </T3>The Commissioner may, only in revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability, prescribe such additionalguidance as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to the applicationof this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>The following definitions are applicable for purposes of section 401(a)(26)and the regulations thereunder:(a) <T3>Collective bargaining agreement. </T3>The term ``collective bargainingagreement'' refers to an agreement that the Secretary of Labor finds tobe a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives andthe employer, which agreement satisfies andSection; 301.7701-17T.

Individuals that an employer treatsas leased employees under section 414(n), pursuant to the requirementsof section 414(o), are considered to be leased employees for purposes ofthis paragraph (b).(2) <T3>Active and former employees. </T3>An active employee is an individualcurrently performing services as an employee for the employer. An individualceases to be an active employee and is treated as a former employee commencingwith the day after the day on which the employee terminates from servicefor the employer. Thus, an employee who terminates from service for anemployer during a plan year is both an active employee and a former employeefor such plan year.(3) <T3>Highly compensated employee. </T3>The term ``highly compensated employee''means a highly compensated employee within the meaning of section 414(q).(4) <T3>Nonhighly compensated employee. </T3>The term ``nonhighly compensatedemployee'' means an employee who is not a highly compensated employee.(c) <T3>Employer. </T3>For purposes of section 401(a)(26), except as specificallyprovided otherwise in the regulations under section 401(a)(26), the term``employer'' means the employer maintaining the plan and those employersrequired to be aggregated with such employer under sections 414 (b), (c),(m), or (o). An individual who owns the entire interest of an unincorporatedtrade or business is treated as an employer. Also, a partnership is treatedas the employer of each partner and each employee of the partnership.(d) <T3>Defined contribution plan. </T3>The term ``defined contribution plan''means a defined contribution plan within the meaning of section 414(i).(e) <T3>Defined benefit plan. </T3>The term ``defined benefit plan'' meansa defined benefit plan within the meaning of section 414(j).(f) <T3>Multiemployer plan. </T3>A multiemployer plan is a multiemployer planwithin the meaning of section 414(f).(g) <T3>Professional. </T3>The term ``professional'' means any individual who,on any day of the plan year, performs professional services for the employeras a certified or other public accountant, actuary, architect, attorney,chiropodist, chiropractor, executive, investment banker, medical doctor,dentist, optometrist, osteopath, podiatrist, engineer, psychologist, stockbroker,veterinarian or in such other professional capacity determined by the Commissionerin a notice or other document of general applicability to constitute theperformance of services as a professional.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effective dates and transition rules.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d)of this section, section 401(a)(26) and the regulations thereunder shallapply to plan years beginning after December 31, 1988.(b) <T3>Transition rules_</T3>(1) <T3>Current benefit structures. </T3>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of thissection, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, and before January1, 1990, the only rights and features to be taken into account in identifyingcurrent benefit structures under andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2(d)(3) are thebases and conditions applicable to the determination of an employee's contributionallocation under a defined contribution plan and the bases and conditionsapplicable to the determination of an employee's normal retirement benefit,any early retirement benefit that is reduced by less than 3 percent foreach year of early commencement, the employee's qualified joint and survivorannuity benefit and any accrual, availability and eligibility conditionsrelated to these normal retirement, early retirement or joint and survivorannuity benefits. Thus, for example, except to the extent included in thepreceding sentence, optional forms of benefit, loans, self-directed investmentoptions and ancillary benefits are to be disregarded for purposes of identifyinga plan's current benefit structures for plan years beginning in 1989. However,the rules relating to other arrangements that, in accordance with andSection;1.401(a)(26)-2(d)(1), may cause a defined benefit plan to be treated ascomprising separate current benefit structures are effective for all planyears that are subject to section 401(a)(26) under paragraph (a) of thissection, including those that begin before January 1, 1990.(2) <T3>Prior benefit structures. </T3>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of thissection, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, and before January1, 1990, if a defined benefit plan reasonably complies with the rules inandSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b)(2) applicable in determining whether the planhas a current benefit structure that is meaningful relative to the benefitsaccrued under the plan and whether a plan's prior benefit structure satisfiessection 401(a)(26), such plan will be treated as satisfying such standards.Whether compliance is reasonable is to be determined on the basis of allfacts and circumstances; precise application and satisfaction of the rulesin andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b)(2) is not required. In making this determination,special emphasis will be placed on whether a defined benefit plan thatfails to satisfy the rules set forth in andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-6(b)(2)is an ongoing plan providing meaningful, additional benefits to employeesor whether such plan is substantially inactive and whether the plan's designor operation is consistent with an attempt to avoid or has the effect ofavoiding the requirements, objectives, or effective dates of section 401(a)(26).(3) <T3>Certain plan terminations</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of thissection, if a plan terminates after section 401(a)(26) becomes effectivewith respect to the plan (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section),the plan will not be treated as a qualified plan upon termination unlessit complies with section 401(a)(26) and the regulations thereunder (tothe extent they are applicable) for all periods for which section 401(a)(26)is effective with respect to the plan.(ii) <T3>Exception. </T3>Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)(3)(i) of thissection, a plan will not fail to be treated as a qualified plan upon terminationmerely because such plan fails to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(26)and the regulations thereunder if all of the following applicable conditionsare satisfied:(A) In the case of a defined benefit plan, no highly compensated employeehas an accrued benefit under the plan in addition to the lesser of eitherthe benefit such employee had accrued as of the close of the last planyear beginning before January 1, 1989, or the benefit such employee wouldhave accrued as of the close of such last plan year under the terms ofthe plan in effect and applicable with respect to such employee on December13, 1988.(B) In the case of a defined contribution plan, no highly compensated employeereceives a contribution allocation for any plan year beginning after December31, 1988. For this reason, a contribution allocation with respect to anemployee for a plan year beginning before January 1, 1989, may be treatedas a contribution allocation for a plan year beginning after December 31,1988 if the allocation for the prior year is in excess of the allocationthat the employee would have received for such year under the terms ofthe plan in effect and applicable with respect to such employee on December13, 1988. An allocation of forfeitures to highly compensated employeeswith respect to contributions made for plan years beginning before January1, 1988, will not cause a defined contribution plan to fail to satisfythe requirements in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B).(C) The plan is terminated with a termination date on or before May 31,1989.(c) <T3>Waiver of excise tax on reversions_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Pursuant to section 1112(e)(3) of the Tax Reform Actof 1986 (TRA '86), if certain conditions are satisfied, a waiver of theexcise tax under section 4980 applies with respect to any employer reversionthat occurs by reason of the termination or merger of a plan before thefirst year to which section 401(a)(26) applies to such plan. In general,the applicable conditions are that the plan must have been in existenceon August 16, 1986; the plan would have failed to satisfy the requirementsof section 401(a)(26) if such section were in effect for the plan yearincluding August 16, 1986, and such plan continued to fail such requirementsat all times thereafter; the plan satisfies the applicable conditions inparagraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section; and certain requirementsregarding asset or liability transfers and mergers and spinoffs involvingsuch plan after August 16, 1986, are satisfied.(2) <T3>Termination date.</T3> An employer reversion with respect to a planwill be eligible for the section 4980 excise tax waiver only if such employerreversion occurs by reason of the termination of the plan with a terminationdate, prior to the first plan year for which section 401(a)(26) appliesto such plan. Solely for purposes of this waiver, the employer reversionwill be treated as satisfying this paragraph (c)(2) even though the plan'stermination date is during the first plan year for which section 401(a)(26)applies to such plan if the plan's termination date is on or before May31, 1989. If the termination date occurs in the first plan year for whichsection 401(a)(26) applied to the plan and the employer receives a reversionthat is eligible for the waiver of the section 4980 tax, the plan is subjectto the interest rate restriction set forth in section 1112(e)(3)(B) ofTRA '86.(3) <T3>Failure to satisfy section 401(a)(26).</T3> An employer reversion withrespect to a plan will be eligible for the excise tax waiver only if suchplan was in existence on August 16, 1986 and, if section 401(a)(26) hadapplied to the plan for the plan year including such date, the plan wouldhave failed to satisfy section 401(a)(26) for such plan year and continuouslythereafter until such plan's termination or merger. For purposes of thisparagraph (c), a plan will be treated as though it would have failed tosatisfy section 401(a)(26) before such section actually applied with respectto the plan only if the plan (as defined under section 414(l)) failed tobenefit at least the lesser of 50 active employees or 40 percent of theemployer's active employees. In general, this determination is to be madeon the basis of only the applicable statutory provisions, without regardto the regulations under section 401(a)(26). Thus, for example, the currentand prior benefit structure rules in the regulations under section 401(a)(26)are not applicable in determining whether a plan would have failed to satisfysection 401(a)(26) for plan years prior to the effective date of section401(a)(26) with respect to such plan. Similarly, the failure to benefitat least the lesser of 50 former employees or 40 percent of the employer'sformer employees does not cause the plan to be treated as failing to satisfysection 401(a)(26) for plan years prior to the effective date of section401(a)(26) with respect to the plan.(d) <T3>Special rule for collective bargaining agreements.</T3> In the caseof a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements(as defined in andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-7(a)) that were ratified before March1, 1986, section 401(a)(26) and the regulations thereunder shall not applyto plan years beginning before the earlier of_(1) The later of_(i) January 1, 1989, or(ii) The date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreementsterminates, or(2) January 1, 1991. For purposes of this paragraph (b) of this section,any extension or renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreement thatis ratified after February 28, 1986 shall be disregarded in determiningthe date on which such collective bargaining agreement terminates.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
