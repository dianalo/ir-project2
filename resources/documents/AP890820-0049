The cards are the focus of a power struggle between the army andArab uprising leaders. Israeli authorities require that Arabs in theoccupied Gaza Strip carry the cards to enter Israel.   In clashes in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West BankSunday, troops shot and wounded at least 15 Palestinians, Arabhospital officials said. They said nine others were injured byrubber-coated metal pellets.   The military confirmed six Arabs were wounded by army gunfire.   Also Sunday in Jerusalem, a Palestinian youth stabbed an Israelisoldier four times, slightly wounding him in the chest. The soldierwas identified as Mordechai Kahane, a nephew of American-born RabbiMeir Kahane, leader of an anti-Arab political party.   ``He fell on me and and grabbed me and cried Allahu Akbar (God isgreat) and I felt a pain,'' the soldier said on army radio.   Arieh Bibi, the city's police chief, said an 18-year-old Arab wasarrested and told investigators he carried out the knifing inrevenge for an Israeli attack on a cousin.   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, 15-year-old WalidSalem Shamas was fatally wounded in the chest in a clash withsoldiers, Arab reports said.   The army confirmed his death and said the military wasinvestigating.   In the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, Palestinian activistsfatally attacked Salem Suleiman El Oud, 36, with axes and knivesSaturday night after he refused to hand over his computerized travelpermit to Israel, Arab reports said. An army spokesman confirmed thekilling.   Oud was also suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities,Arab reports said.   During the 20-month-old uprising, 97 Arabs have been killed byfellow Palestinians because they were suspected of collaboratingwith Israel. At least 539 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis,and 38 Israelis also have been slain.   Israeli authorities have required all residents of Gaza to havenew computerized cards to enter Israel starting Friday. Uprisingleaders have been collecting the cards to disrupt the new Israelisystem.   Arab reporters who counted cars Sunday estimated that about 1,100of the 40,000 workers left for work in Israel. The small number wasattributed to a two-week strike against the new card system calledby the uprising leaders.   A 48-year-old construction worker who would give only his firstname, Khalil, told a reporter that members of an underground``popular committee'' confiscated his card and he could not work inIsrael.   ``I have 14 children. If I stop working in Israel, how are theygoing to eat?'' he said. He refused to give his full name for fearof reprisals.   In the West Bank, Palestinian youths set up roadblocks Sunday tostop laborers from going to jobs in Israel. Some workers said theywere refusing to honor a one-week strike call in sympathy with Gazanlaborers because they needed money to feed their families.   Several workers in the Jalazoun refugee camp near Ramallah saidtheir car was stopped and set ablaze Thursday night by 50 maskedyouths who took their identity cards to prevent them from going towork during the one-week strike.   In the Amari refugee camp, also near Ramallah, residents saidalmost all men with jobs in Israel went to work Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
