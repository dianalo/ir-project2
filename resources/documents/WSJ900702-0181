Stertz   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   GM C F</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><LP>   DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.followed Ford Motor Co.'s lead in an unusual midyear priceincrease on most of their cars and some trucks.   The Big Three auto makers rarely lift prices in midyear.The last time GM did so was 1986. But the moves, in responseto Ford's action on June 18, reflect a desire by the BigThree to increase revenues hurt by weak sales and to mitigatepossible &quot;sticker-shock&quot; when they announce prices on thisfall's 1991 models. When 1990 models debuted last year, theirfar-higher sticker prices drove many buyers away, causing alonglasting sales slump.</LP><TEXT>   GM, Ford and Chrysler also were emboldened to raise pricesbecause their stocks of unsold cars are far leaner this yearthan last year as they head into summer and the end of the1990 model year. GM dealers, for example, had a 62-day supplyof unsold cars at the end of May compared with a 72-daysupply a year earlier. Chrysler had a low 56-day supply,compared with a 67-day supply.   Still, Chrysler has struggled with slow sales this year,causing some dealers to worry about the $60 to $160 priceincreases Chrysler announced Friday on most of its cars andsome trucks. The No. 3 auto maker also raised destinationcharges on some of its vehicles by $15 or $30. Chrysler saidit was taking the step because of &quot;increased operating andproduct costs.&quot;   GM also is raising prices on a variety of vehicles by $66to $369. In addition, GM is raising destination charges forall cars and trucks by $10. GM said it made the moves to&quot;partially offset higher raw materials, labor and healthcosts.&quot;   GM officials said the company's prices overall rose anaverage of $83 a vehicle, or five-tenths of one percent.Chrysler didn't provide an overall average increase.   The Chrysler and GM increases are effective today. Ford'sprice hikes ranged from $58 to $134 on many cars and trucks.   Even though the increases might seem modest, some Chryslerdealers fear any boost could scare away marginal buyers.That's something Chrysler can ill afford because its combinedcar and truck sales through May were off 14.8% from a yearago, while its share of the U.S. car market for May droppedto 9.7% from 10.9%.   But May was still an improvement over April's 7.8% share.Analysts said the uptick gave Chrysler a window ofopportunity to generate more revenue. &quot;Chrysler's share amongdomestic car makers has bounced back recently and therehasn't been that much deterioration in sales, so they thoughtthey could get away with a slight increase,&quot; said DavidHealy, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd investmentbanking arm of Barclays Group.   Chrysler said its smallest increase of $60 comes on theDodge Daytona, which started at $9,745, and on most ChryslerLeBaron models. The $160 boost affects Chrysler Fifth Avenue,which started at $20,860 and Imperial, which started at$25,495.   Prices of Chrysler's minivans will each increase $118,except for the Chrysler Town andamp; Country version, which willcost $125 more. Chrysler's least expensive minivan previouslystarted at $11,995.   Chrysler isn't raising prices of its least-expensivedomestic cars, the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow or ontwo of its slowest-selling cars the Eagle Premier and DodgeMonaco.   The No. 3 domestic auto maker didn't release anyinformation about price increases on Jeeps models. Butdealers said base prices on Cherokee, Wagoneer and GrandWagoneer jumped an average of $103.   GM slapped its biggest price increase of $369 on the 1991Chevrolet S/T Blazer two-door truck. The truck's price priorto the move was $12,966. The No. 1 auto maker also added $220to the price of the 1991 Caprice Classic, which had cost$15,125.   The lowest price increases of $65 primarily affected the1990-model GM-10 cars: Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Regal,Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix. The weaksales of the midsized cars have disappointed GM officials whoexpected the GM-10s to constitute the heart of GM's lineup.</TEXT></DOC>
