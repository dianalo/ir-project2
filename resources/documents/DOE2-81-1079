It is established that the NiC/sub 2/O/sub4/x2H/sub 2/O(1) compound is formed in all systems in a solid phase,and Cs(Ni(C/sub 2/O/sub 4/)/sub 2/)x4H/sub 2/O(2) - in the system withcesium oxalate. Complex 2, unlike compound 1, dissolves well in waterand does not dissolve in the cesium oxalate excess. At 150 deg C complex2 losses crystallization water and in 310-500 deg C interval it decomposeswith Cs/sub 2/NiO/sub 2/ formation. 2 refs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
