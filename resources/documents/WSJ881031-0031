But while attorneys have aired some controversial ads of their own -- warning that drug dealers, drunk drivers, and toxic polluters will benefit from the proposal, Amendment 10, they are avoiding bad-mouthing doctors.    &quot;This is not a doctor-lawyer issue,&quot; says Rutledge R. Liles, president of the Florida Bar. &quot;The doctors want to make the public mad enough at lawyers that they'll vote against lawyers instead of looking at the issue.&quot;    The amendment on the Nov. 8 ballot would place a $100,000 cap on non-economic, or &quot;pain and suffering,&quot; losses in all types of liability cases ranging from medical malpractice to automobile accidents to product-liability suits. Twenty-eight states have passed laws calling for some type of cap on non-economic damages, but none has a limit as low as the $100,000 proposed in Florida, which has experienced a large number of big jury verdicts and high medical-malpractice insurance costs.    While doctors are hailing Amendment 10 as &quot;the answer to the health-care crisis&quot; and &quot;greedy lawyers' lawsuits,&quot; attorneys' ads label the measure the &quot;Drunk Drivers', Drug Dealers', and Toxic Polluters' Protection Act.&quot;    One TV ad by proponents of the amendment depicts a panic-stricken elderly woman rushing her husband, an apparent heart-attack victim, into an ambulance to discover the nearest emergency room is 20 minutes away because others have closed as a result of sky-high medical-malpractice insurance costs. &quot;Stop emergency-room shutdowns. Get the lawyers and the insurance companies under control,&quot; the ad urges. &quot;Vote Yes on Amendment 10.&quot;    Each side is spending $4 million to $5 million on the campaign, much of it on 30-second TV spots. And each blames the other for the negativism. &quot;I think what they're doing is sleazy,&quot; Mr. Liles, president of the Florida Bar, says of the lawyer bashing.    Dr. Bruce Weissman, a member of the board of governors of the Florida Medical Association, says physicians originally planned an informational campaign, emphasizing the availability of health care, but changed tack after the lawyers fired the first volley with a series of &quot;sensational&quot; ads claiming drug dealers, drunk drivers and toxic polluters &quot;just won't have to pay very much,&quot; if the amendment passes.    The doctors shot back by replaying the ads, slashing Xs across the screen and blasting them as &quot;lies and distortions&quot; from lawyers who &quot;manipulate the legal system to make millions for themselves off of other people's pain and suffering.&quot; Another ad says if Amendment 10 passes, &quot;We win, and the lawyers lose.&quot;    Don Ringe, of Ringe Media Inc., Washington, D.C., who produced the ads for the amendment's supporters, says, &quot;No one anticipated the gross distortions the lawyers would employ. It meant fighting an emotional plea with an emotional plea.&quot;    Lawyers, however, decided that &quot;attacking doctors wouldn't be very sensible,&quot; says Ralph Murphine, a Washington, D.C., political consultant for Alert 88, a group backed by lawyers, which has stressed instead that the proposal is overly broad, covering much more than medical malpractice. He says a tort-reform issue was defeated in Arizona two years ago when promoters used a similar lawyer-bashing campaign.    Some television stations, such as WPLG Channel 10, the ABC affiliate in Miami, refused to accept some ads from both sides. &quot;All those ads were sensationalistic and didn't deal with points relevant to the issue,&quot; says John Garwood, Channel 10's vice president and general manager. &quot;For that reason they could be misleading or confusing.&quot;    For their own part, the lawyers have targeted a group they perceive as even less lovable than lawyers: insurance companies. &quot;Insurance companies. The bigger they get, the more money they want,&quot; says one TV ad, showing a wide-angle shot of imposing skyscrapers from the ground up.    &quot;Public perception of doctors is the highest and of insurance companies is lowest, and lawyers are somewhere in-between,&quot; says Robert Goodman, head of Robert Goodman Agency Inc. a Baltimore media consultant, who produced the ad campaign against the measure for the lawyers side. </TEXT></DOC>
