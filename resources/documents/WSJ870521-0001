KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CATFARM EQUIPMENT (FAR)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department cited a Caterpillar Inc. tractor plant for 194 alleged violations of federal workplace safety rules, and proposed fines totaling $776,000.    The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged that during 1986, the company failed to record, or improperly recorded, workplace injuries and illnesses such as burns, fractures, lacerations, strains and sprains at the plant in Montgomery, Ill.    The agency cited Caterpillar with willful violations of OSHA record-keeping requirements, which involves an employer's knowingly violating the rules, or being aware of a hazardous condition and making no reasonable effort to correct it.    OSHA has stepped up its actions against companies for record-keeping violations over the past year, levying more than $3 million in penalties. The citations are an important part of an effort under Labor Secretary William Brock to reverse some of the deregulatory policies instituted during the Reagan administration's early years.    The string of charges of record-keeping violations have included proposals for fines of $1.3 million against Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide Corp. and $910,000 against Highland Park, Mich.-based Chrysler Corp. The proposed penalty against Caterpillar is the third-largest in agency history, a spokesman said.    Union Carbide is contesting the OSHA allegations, while Chrysler has agreed to pay $295,000, without admitting guilt as to the charges.    OSHA's inspection of the Illinois plant began late last year in response to a worker complaint, the agency said. According to OSHA, its investigation revealed the company failed to meet federal rules and Caterpillar's own corporate record-keeping policies.    &quot;There has been no willful or systematic attempt&quot; on the company's part to violate or evade OSHA record-keeping guidelines, said Gil Nolde, a spokesman for Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar.    Mr. Nolde said OSHA's record-keeping rules are subject to interpretation, and that it is possible the company could have &quot;interpreted some information differently.&quot;    Nevertheless, he said, the maker of construction machinery and diesel engines will fight the decision.    Caterpillar has 15 working days to contest the charges and proposed penalties before the separate Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    Records of workplace injuries and illnesses help identify potential hazards and show where corrective action may be needed, said John Pendergrass, a department assistant secretary who heads OSHA.    The agency also uses the records to target its inspection efforts toward high-hazard industries; the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the records in compiling national injury and illness statistics. </TEXT></DOC>
