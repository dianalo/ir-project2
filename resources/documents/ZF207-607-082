MIS out in the field who canaccess any of the data without having to know where it's located -- wherephysically, or in which of the systems,&quot; Mitchell said.andP;  To create anencyclopedia with information about all the Army systems, STAMIS would haveto be transparent to users and have integrated applications.andM;Perhaps the most crucial research project going on at AIRMICS is acommunications study of how the Army will accommodate the technologyassociated with the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Mitchellsaid.andM;&quot;With help from Georgia Tech and some equipment donated by vendors,&quot; he said,&quot;we've put together an ISDN test bed.andP;  What we're looking at is how the Armyis going to apply that technology, what the hardware will be and how todevelop the techniques and procedures to quantitatively measure and evaluatethe characteristics of ISDN and the services it will provide.&quot;andM;Mitchell also said the study is pointed at &quot;getting a little more specificabout what we need to be doing now as we're fielding communications system tomake sure they are ISDN-compatible.&quot;andM;AIRMICS conducts many of its projects based on a fee for services with theArmy commands who commission research work.andP;  Mitchell said one project donefor Army Forces Command brought an amount almost equal to the group's yearlybudget.andP;  &quot;We run AIRMICS with a real entrepreneurial spirit,&quot; Mitchell said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
