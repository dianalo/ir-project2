Also at the meeting, which was closed to the press, Kodakexecutives said operating margins in its core imaging segmentwould be flat to slightly down, according to First Bostonanalyst Curt Rohrman. Productivity gains had boosted themargins to 22.6% in 1990, from 17.3% the year before, but anygains this year will be offset by higher advertising costsand start-up costs for Kodak's new film-sensitizing plant.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Whitmore said that while the information unit's corebusinesses -- copiers, graphics and business imaging -- havebeen making money, smaller businesses have recently beenlosing money. These smaller businesses include Atex, anewspaper prepress system; Data Tape, which makes imagecapture systems used for aerial reconaissance; and KIMS, aninformation storage and retrieval system. Kodak wrote offmost of the KIMS products last year.   Kodak executives didn't say they would try to sell thetroubled businesses. But according to First Boston analystCurt Rohrman, Kodak did say, &quot;If things don't work out, we'regoing to get rid of problem children.&quot;   Kodak executives said they will make the unit profitableby introducing new products and increasing revenues,according to Smith Barney analyst Peter Enderlin. But Mr.Enderlin was skeptical of the strategy, saying the company&quot;needs to get tougher on the cost side.&quot;   Mr. Whitmore said Kodak plans to reduce corporate debt by$1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next five years,according to analysts. Kodak currently has more than $9billion of corporate debt.   Separately, Kodak said it has agreed in principle with theElectronic Book Co. to let the company use Kodak's Photo CDto make an electronic stock photograph system in which stockphotos can be stored on compact disks, viewed on computersand distributed via modem. The announcement is significantbecause it shows that Kodak is developing a commercial marketfor a system that allows people to store their regular photoson compact disks and view them on television.</TEXT></DOC>
