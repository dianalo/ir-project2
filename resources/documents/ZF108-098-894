 One thing hasn't changed, however: CD-ROM drives areas slow as floppy-disk drives.andM;Performance is the top priority when choosing a CD-ROM drive.andP;  A slow CD-ROMdrive can result in delays measured not in fractions of seconds but infractions of minutes.andP;  To cut down the wait, we recommend that you choose oneof the two drives that use the Toshiba 3201-B mechanism, the fastest on themarket.andM;Our favorite is CD Technology's Porta-Drive ($895), a small unit that comeswith a separate power supply or optional battery pack.andP;  Its performance isessentially equal to the other Toshiba-based drive, Toshiba's own XM-3201 A1MAC ($970), but the Porta-Drive is our best-buy recommendation.andP;  It's lessexpensive, it's portable, and CD Technology has a January-to-June offer of,icrosoft Office and Image Club's LetterPress TypeVEndor for an additionalcharge of only $300.andP;  Even after this offer expires, the Porta-Drive willstill be compact, fast, and versatile.andM;Toshiba's XM-3201 MAC is a close second.andP;  It's fast, lightweight, very wellbuilt, and inexpensive.andP;  And although the power supply is built in, the driveis only slightly larger than the Porta-Drive.andP;  Unfortunately, both CDTechnology's and Toshiba's drives lack good audio facilities.andM;If you're a professional musician, the OMI ProCDP ($1,488) is for you.andP;  Theprice is quite a bit higher than those of the other CD-ROM drives, but youget output jacks common in the music industry and the convenience of 19-inchrack mounting.andP;  Although its access times were not among the best, itsthroughput was just slightly less than that of the Toshiba-based drives.andM;The AppleCD ($1,199) is the patriarch of CD-ROM drives.andP;  It's slower than theleaders but manages to stay far ahead of two of its newer challengers.andP;  It'ssolidly built and intelligently designed, but -- as with some of Apple'sother peripherals -- you pay a premium for the Apple logo.andM;We would pick Apple's drive over the Denon DRD-253 ($990) and NEC CDR-77($999 for the drive, $199 for essential software and cable).andP;  Bot useoutdated drive mechanisms and turned in realworld performances that wereagnozingly slow.andM;AppleCD SCandM;This is the drive that started it all for Mac CD-ROM.andP;  Though expensive, it'swell built and offers good -- but not great -- speed.andP;  Audio features includeRCA stereo jacks; a convenient thumbwheel volume controls; and CD Remote, thebest audio-control software.andM;Pros: Pushpin SCSI identification.andP;  Automatic adjustment to U.S.andP;  or Europeanpower.andP;  Excellent audio software.andM;Cons: Expensive.andP;  90-day warranty.andP;  No AC fuse.andM;CD Technology Porta-DriveandM;At the Porta-Drive's heart is a Toshiba 3201-B mechanism, the fastestavailable for the MAC.andP;  Its separate power supply can be placed on the flooror replaced by an optional four-pound battery pack.andP;  Until June 1990, thiscompact package is an unbeatable value because CD Technology is offeringMicrosoft Office and Image Club's LetterPress TypeVendor for only $300 extra.andM;Pros: Tied for fastest performance.andP;  Least expensive, smallest, and lightest.andO;Can be set for either U.S.andP;  or European power.andP;  Battery-pack option.andM;Cons: No preamp audio output.andP;  Three-position volume control.andP;  No powerindicator or AC Fuse.andP;  No audio software.andM;Denon DRD-253andM;The ponderous performance of this drive lags far behind that of most of theother drives.andP;  The built-in speaker is good for working with audio, but itspresence doesn't explain the box's large size.andP;  You can operate it as astand-alone audio CD player, but only after you disconnect it from the Macand set a bank of DIP switches.andM;Pros: Internal speaker.andP;  Preamp and headphone audio output.andP;  Access and powerindicators.andP;  Internal AC fuse.andM;Cons: Very slow.andP;  Only one 50-pin SCSI connector.andP;  Internal SCSI termination.andO;No audio software.andM;NEC CDR-77andM;This sluggish drive is far behind the mainstream in speed.andP;  Its CD caddy isnot compatible with those of the other drives reviewed.andP;  Although the CDR-77includes software that allows the Mac to control audio functions, the Maccan't be used for anything else during play.andM;Pros: Audio software (though limited).andP;  Internal AC fuse.andM;Cons: Very slow.andP;  Essential Macinterface kit is an expensive &quot;option.&quot;andM;OMI ProCDPandM;Not for average users, this 19-inch rack-mountable drive featuresprofessional audio-output jacks for use in studio environments.andP;  It'srelatively fast and extremely well built.andP;  Headphone and stereo outputs areprovided by quarter-inch phone jacks.andP;  An enhanced model, the Combo ProCDP($2,495), comes with a built-in RS-422 interface to control musical keyboardfunctions.andP;  An upgrade to the Combo unit is available for $695.andM;Pros: Very good overall speed.andP;  Professional audio outputs.andP;  Automaticadjustment to U.S.andP;  or European power.andP;  External AC Fuse.andM;Cons: Slow access times.andP;  Most expensive, largest, and heaviest.andP;  No audiosoftware.andM;Toshiba XM-3201 A1 MACandM;Toshiba is the name of the game in CD-ROM performance right now.andP;  This verysolidly built unit uses the same mechanism as does the CD TechnologyPorta-Drive but incorporates its power supply into a slightly larger case.andM;Pros: Tied for fastest performance.andP;  Automatic adjustment to U.S.andP;  orEuropean power.andP;  Compact.andP;  Internal AC fuse.andM;Cons: No preamp audio output.andP;  Three-position volume control.andP;  No powerindicator.andP;  No audio software.andM;On the HorizonandM;The mac CD-ROM market is expanding rapidly.andP;  Since we began testing, severalinteresting new drives have appeared.andP;  For example, NEC is now shipping aCD-ROM drive that doubles as a stand-alone audio CD player.andP;  The NEC CDR-35($698) detaches from its SCSI-interface dock and becomes a self-containedaudio CD player with a display for the track number and controls for movingbetween tracks.andP;  The CDR-35 can run on an optional $79 batter pack or on theincluded power supply.andM;The drive fits in the Mac Portable case, weighing in at three pounds with thebattery pack.andP;  Taking a cue from the power-management system of the Portable,the CDR-35 stops spinning after five minutes of inactivity to prolong batterylife; any access request brings it back up to speed again.andP;  Our experiencewith the drive is that it is flower than most, but its versatility and lowprice make it an attractive choice.andP;  NEC Technologies USA, 1255 MichaelDrive, Wood Dale, IL 60191; (800) 366-3632 or (312) 860-9500.andM;Procom Technology has released a low-cost CD-ROM drive, the HiPerformance($799).andP;  Lucky buyers of early models are assured a Toshiba mechanism at verygood price, but Procom won't guarantee that this mechanism will remain itsinnards of choice.andP;  Procom Technology, 200 McCormick Ave., Costa Mesa, CA92626; (714) 549-9449.andM;Another new drive, the CM 231 ($1,130) from Optical Access International,contains an LMSI mechanism in a zero-footprint case that fits under anycompact Mac.andP;  Instead of a linear head configuration (see the &quot;How It Works&quot;sidebar), this drive employs the radial-arm mechanism often used in harddrives.andP;  Its average access time is fast as CD-ROM drives go, and the betaunit we saw worked very well.andP;  Optical Access International (formerlyMassachusetts Micro Data Systems), 36 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA01801; (800)523-2679 or (617) 935-2679.andM;This spring, Pioneer is expected to ship the DRM-Minichanger, A CD-ROM drivethat makes six discs available at once.andP;  The discs are placed into a plasticframe, which is inserted into a magazine that pops into the front of thedrive.andP;  All six discs can then be accessed without the need to remove andreinsert.andP;  The drive should self for around $1,295.andP;  Pioneer Communicationsof America, Sherbrooke Plaza, 600 E. Crescent Ave., Upper Saddle River, NJ07458; (201) 327-6400.andM;One enormous step above the Minichanger is the Kubik CDM 240, an OEM jukeboxdevice that holds 240 discs -- that's more than 150 gigabytes (billions ofbytes) of on-line storage.andP;  Discs are placed in a carousel the surrounds aCD-ROM drive.andP;  At 17 x 16.5 x 6.5 inches, the CDM 240 is surprisingly smallfor the number of discs it holds.andP;  The unit did not have a retail outlet atpress time, but Kubik will assemble customized systems for about $13,500 fora single unit or $5,000 a unit for quantities of 100 or more.andP;  Kubik, 18873Allendale Ave., Saratoga, CA 95070; (408) 867-7969.andM;I first saw one on a &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode: a shiny, rugged, coaster-sized discthat contained vast quantities of information.andP;  Fifteen years later, I was ata computer show looking at an entire encyclopedia on an equally small, nearlyindestructible disc.andP;  The disc was a CD-ROM (compact disc--read-only memory),the computer cousin of the familiar audio compact disc.andM;Like audio CDs, these discs are read by a laser-equipped player, known in thecomputer world as a CD-ROM drive.andP;  A CD-ROM disc (optical) is not used forpersonal data storage as is a hard disk (magnetic).andP;  CD-ROM involves aread-only technology.andP;  You can't write anything onto a CD-ROM disc, nor canyou change what's imprinted on it.andP;  A disc is like a book: You buy it, andyou read it--you don't change it.andM;CD-ROM's strong suit is its extraordinary capacity.andP;  A single disc cancontain up to 650 megabytes of text, sound, and graphics.andP;  Currentdata-compression schemes can squeeze more than 250,000 pages of text onto oneeasily transportable disc.andP;  Despite this potential, until recently CD-ROMshave been as accessible to Mac users as the disc Spock used.andM;Until early last year, CD-ROM was a &quot;chicken or egg, which comes first?&quot;andO;standoff between drive manufacturers and disc publishers.andP;  The problem isn'thardware--the technology is rock solid.andP;  CD-ROM drives and audio CD playersuse similar optical mechanisms.andP;  In fact, a CD-ROM drive is essentially anaudio CD player with a computer interface tacked on.andP;  Mac-compatible hardwarehas been available since 1988, when Apple introduced its CD-ROM drive, theAppleCD SC.andP;  And Apple wasn't a reckless pioneer--CD-ROM drives had debutedthree years earlier in the PC market.andM;Although the hardware has been available for a while, only recently haveenough general-interest discs become available to make buying a driveworthwhile.andP;  But don't blame the software publishers.andP;  There haven't beenenough drives on users' desks to make publishing Mac CD-ROMs worthwhile.andO;Around 3 million Macs have been shipped, but fewer than 20,000 are attachedtO a CD-ROM drive.andP;  Last year, however, the Mac CD-ROM drought finally beginshowing signs of abating.andP;  Publishers took a risk and began releasing discsthat combine CD-ROM's enormous size with the Mac's unique graphics and soundcapabilities.andP;  Interest shot up throughout the industry.andP;  If predictions bysuch boosters as the Optical Publishing Association are anywhere nearcorrect, the current trickle of Mac CD-ROM discs could become a flood in the'90s.andP;  (Look for a roundup of the best discs in next month's issue.)andM;New drives have also appeared.andP;  Until recently, you had only one choice --Apple's.andP;  The lack of competition kept prices high and innovation low.andP;  Now,however, new drives have arrived to challenge Apple's monopoly.andP;  These unitshave attractive prices (as low as $895) and innovative features that makethem worthy competitors.andP;  When we began testing, there were five challengers:the CD Technology Porta-Drive, Denon DRD-253, NEC CDR-77, OMI ProCDP, andToshiba XM-3201 A1 MAC.andM;MAcUser Labs ran a suite of real-world and specialized technical tests to seehow the five newcomers stand up against the AppleCD SC.andP;  We measured how eachdrive behaved during normal use by launching a CD-ROM-based application,opening files, and copying files from the CD-ROM onto a hard disk.andP;  We thenthrashed each drive for a few hours with sophisticated test equipment todiscover the reasons behind their real-world performance.andP;  We also ranpreliminary tests on two beta products, the NEC CDR-35 portable and theOptical Access CM 231 (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot; sidebar).andP;  Our conclusion:Competition has indeed created better drives and increased the value of yourCD-ROM dollar--although some drives have taken a step or two backward fromApple's.andM;But we also learned that if CD-ROM technology is to reach even half thepotential its boosters claim, any new disc that enters the market must beattractive enough to make users forget CD-ROM's most annoying attribute: itsslowness.andM;The Great DistributorandM;All CD-ROM drives are slow (see Figure 1).andP;  And we mean s-l-o-w.andP;  Or, betteryet, s -- l -- o -- w.andP;  In fact, our tests show that in most cases, CD-ROMdrives are even slower than floppy-disk drives.andP;  And because of inherentlimitations in CD-ROM standards, they're not going to get much faster.andM;CD-ROM is a locked technology, frozen in place by aging standards.andP;  Bydefining such elements as disc capacity and data-transfer rate, theSony-Philips Red Book, developed in the late '70s, defined the performancelimits of audio CDs.andP;  The Yellow Book upgrade, which appeared in the early'80s, extended these limits to CD-ROM.andP;  Any manufacturer could ignore thesestandards and create a faster optical-disc system that held more data.andP;  Thenew technology might be better, but it wouldn't be CD-ROM.andP;  It's riskybusiness to establish a new standard--especially when the existing one iswell accepted and full of promise.andM;Despite its limitations, CD-ROM serves a purpose not met by any othermass-storage device.andP;  The name of the game is distribution.andP;  Like audio CDs,CD-ROMs can deliver huge amounts of information in a compact form -- butthat's where the similarity ends.andP;  Audio CDs are limited to music, butCD-ROMs can deliver clip art, encyclopedias, interactive multimediapresentations, the complete works of Shakespeare, and music.andP;  Anything yourMac can display or play can be distributed cheaply and reliably.andM;Publishers can also use the massive capacity of CD-ROMs to increase the valueof their products.andP;  Microsoft, for example, uses less than 1 percent of itsMicrosoft Office disc to distribute Excel, PowerPoint, Mail, and Word.andP;  Itthen fills the next 15 percent of the disk with a manual for each of theseapplications, an extensive tutorial, a HyperCard-based help system, 383screen fonts from Adobe, clip art from Genigraphics, and two dozen otherthird-party applications and utilities.andP;  All this extra software comes on onedisc, with plenty of room to spare -- enough for 200,000 pages of text.andM;Although it makes sense to leave the manuals on the Microsoft Office disc,you'd want to download the applications and utilities onto your hard-diskdrive, because a CD-ROM is just too slow for acceptable performance.andP;  Infact, if CD-ROMs catch on in a big way, one of the beneficiaries will bemanufacturers of large hard disks.andP;  Enormous multimedia presentations, forexample, as well as scientific simulations and interactive trainingapplications, can be distributed safely and inexpensively on cheap, durableCD-ROMs--but the software will need large hard disks to perform at its best.andO;And if an interactive training course requires students to enter information,CD-ROM's read-only nature makes a hard disk a necessity.andM;Major corporations (as well as the U.S.andP;  government) are exploring CD-ROMtechnology as a way of distributing information to employees across thecountry or around the world.andP;  Corporations can create their own CD-ROMs forabout $30 per disc--or less than 5 cents per mega-byte.andP;  At $2.50 permegabyte, floppies just can't compete.andP;  Even cartridges for tape drives, theonly mass-storage media slower than CD-ROMs, cost about 25 cents per megabytewhen full.andP;  CD-ROM costs are getting even lower as production equipment dropsin price and more service companies compete for the corporateCD-ROM-production dollar.andP;  If CD-ROM gains widespread acceptance, largeproduction runs could drop the per-disc cost to less than $2.andM;Companies can save reams of paper--and piles of money -- by using CD-ROMs toreplace training and operating manuals.andP;  For example, the amount of papersaved by one text-only CD-ROM could easily weigh a ton and a half--and costwell over $4,000 to mail.andP;  Armed with a Mac Portable and a CD TechnologyPorta-Drive with optional battery pack, technicians could lug every repairmanual they'd ever need right to the job site.andM;CD-ROM is also an inexpensive alternative to wide-area networks and satellitelinks.andP;  An MIS director can drop a CD-ROM into an envelope and mail a650-megabyte corporate database for 70 cents.andP;  Compare that to transmittingthe same data by modem--it would take 23 days at 2,400 bits per second.andP;  Andbecause the read-only, nonmagnetic character of CD-ROM ensures a fairlypermanent, tamperproof medium, CD-ROM is also ideal for archivinginformation.andM;Getting StartedandM;For many users, poky performance is a fair trade-off for the immense capacityof this rugged, inexpensive medium.andP;  If you or your company agree, CD-ROM isfor you.andP;  As you make your choice among the drives that we tested, you'll behappy to know that all of them are a snap to hook up and use.andP;  Five of thesix manufacturers are also kind enough to supply all the appropriate cables;NEC charges an additional $199 for its SCSI Interface Kit, which contains aSCSI cable and essential software.andM;All the CD-ROM drives are SCSI devices and require attention to two SCSIissues: identification and termination.andP;  The SCSI protocol lets youdaisy-chain up to seven devices, each with a unique identification numberfrom 0 to 6.andP;  All but one of the drives use DIP (dual in-line package)switches to change the preset ID.andP;  The lone exception, the pioneering AppleCDSC, makes the chore easier with a pushpin selector that displays the IDnumber rather than requiring you to interpret the brain-boggling binaryDIP-switch positions.andM;After setting the appropriate SCSI ID, you must make sure that the first andlast devices on your SCSI chain are properly terminated.andP;  This dull butimportant responsibility ensures that all electrical signals fall within anappropriate voltage range.andP;  On five of our CD-ROM drives, you accomplishtermination by inserting a supplied plug into the drive's second SCSIconnector.andP;  The Denon DRD-253, however, doesn't have a second SCSI connector.andO;This omission forces you to place the DRD-253 at the end of your SCSI dailychain or spend a few bucks on a special T-connector.andM;Each drive also includes software that you must place in your System Folderbefore the Max can recognize the discs you insert.andP;  After you restart theMac, you'll notice that no icon appears.andP;  Don't worry; nothing's wrong.andP;  Aswith a floppy drive you must insert a disc (or in the case of a floppy, adisk) before anything shows up on the desktop.andM;Only one manufacturer, CD Technology, offers CD-ROms with its drive.andP;  FromJanuary through June of this year, an extra $300 gets you both MicrosoftOffice (list $949) and a 240-megabyte collection of fonts and clip art fromImage Club (list $199).andP;  The latter disc, LetterPress TypeVendor, contains aPostScript starter set of 10 fonts and 145 images.andP;  Your credit card and aphone call to Image Club can unlock 163 more fonts ($25 each) and 2,200images (in 15 volumes at $99 each).andM;Whatever CD-ROM drive you select, make sure that the CD-ROM discs you buy canbe recognized by the Mac.andP;  Sad to say, most still can't be.andM;Double-Duty DiscsandM;CD-ROMs come in two flavors: PC and Mac.andP;  About one-tenth of all personalcomputers are Macs, and a similar fraction of all CD-ROM discs can be readonly by Macs.andP;  Mac-only discs, such as those with a HyperCard interface, useApple's HFS (Hierarchical File System) to tell the System the location ofeach file on the disc.andP;  Designed for MS-DOS can be read by a Mac only if youuse a software MS-DOS emulator such as SoftPC or a hardware add-on such asMac286 from Orange Micro.andM;Fortunately, two CD-ROM standards have emerged that let Macs and PCsrecognize files from the same discs.andP;  However, just recognizing a file--evenreading it onto a hard disk -- doesn't mean that you can actually use it.andP;  Anapplication must exist -- either on the CD-ROM or on a hard-disk drive--thatgives your Mac access to the information in the file.andP;  And until more CD-ROMdrives infiltrate the Mac world, disc publishers aren't going to spend muchtime developing Mac interfaces for their discs.andP;  Again, the chicken or theegg ....andM;In any case, new standards make double-duty discs possible and someadventurous publishers are taking advantage of them.andP;  The first standard isHigh Sierra, named for a hotel in the California ski country north of LakeTahoe where the standardization meetings were held.andP;  The second standard, ISO9660, is a slightly modified version of High Sierra that was established bythe International Standards Organization.andP;  Both standards benefit developers,who now need to produce only one disc for Macs and PCs.andP;  Each disc containstwo interface applications, one for each computer, and both computers aresmart enough to know which application to use.andP;  Users on both sides of theblue line benefit because more discs can be made available to all.andM;To enable your Mac to read High Sierra or ISO 9660 discs, you simply drop aset of files called High Sierra Access, ISO 9660 Access, and Foreign FileAccess into the System Folder (Foreign File Access determines whether thedisc is High Sierra or ISO 9660).andP;  All three files were written by Apple andare supplied free with five of the drives we tested.andP;  NEC includes the accessfiles in its $199 SCSI Interface Kit.andP;  If you use discs designed solely forthe Mac, you don't need the access files.andP;  An HFS-encoded CD-ROM looks justlike an enormous floppy disk to the Mac.andM;A Snail's RaceandM;After you have inserted your first disc into the protective caddy suppliedwith each drive and slipped the caddy into your new CD-ROM drive, it's timeto experience for yourself what we've warned you about all along: CD-ROMdrives are slow.andP;  Because they are so slow, performance is even more of abuying consideration than it is for a relatively fast device such as a harddrive.andP;  A fast hard drive can save you seconds of time, but a fast CD-ROMdrive can save you minutes.andM;Although there are fairly large performance differences among drives fromdifferent manufacturers, there's a maximum limit to a CD-ROM drive'sdata-transfer speed.andP;  The culprit is the hardware standard that Philips andSony agreed on when they first developed audio CD technology back in the'70s.andP;  Remember, CD-ROM is an offshoot of audio CD, a technology that doesn'tneeds swift access times or high throughput rates.andP;  An audio CD playerrarealy needs to reposition its bulky laser-equipped optical read head, andaudio requirements are easily satisfied by the CD throughput standard of 153Kper second.andP;  As long as CD-ROM rides audio CD's coattails, it will remainslow -- but benefits such as compatibility and low disc cost because ofshared manufacturing plants make sluggish performance a bit more tolerable.andM;Right now, the best way to achieve acceptable CD-ROM speed is to buy theright drive.andP;  To help you choose, we ran a suite of real-world tests on eachof our six candidates.andP;  To provide a reference point, we also ran the sametests on the Quantum Pro80, the hard drive that Apple puts into its high-endMacs.andP;  To see how quickly each drive launches an application that uses alarge data file, we opened a HyperCard stack from Broderbund's ElectronicWhole Earth Catalog CD-ROM.andP;  Because the system overhead required to openmultiple files slows any type of drive, we opened a group of MacPaint filesfrom the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group's PD-ROM.andP;  And finally, to test rawthroughput, we copied a 9-megabyte file from a High Sierra disc called FoodAnalyst onto a fast hard disk.andM;The CD Technology and Toshiba drives, both of which are based on a Toshiba3201-B mechanism, won the race, followed closely by the OMI drive (see Figure1).andP;  Apple's drive follows OMI's, and then there's a longer wait for Denon'sand NEC's.andP;  These last two drives showed similarly poor performance in theHyperCard and MacPaint tests, but when copying the 9-megabyte file, Denon'slimped in a distant last.andM;To uncover the reasons behind these wide differences in performance, wetested the inner workings of each drive.andP;  Using sophisticated test softwarecalled SCSI Bench and a comprehensive test disc from Sony, we ran each drivethrough an exhaustive set of gymnastics.andP;  We wanted to determine how quicklyeach optical head could get to the data it wanted (access time) and -- onceit got there -- how quickly the data could be sent back to the Mac(throughput).andM;Access time turned out to be the deciding factor in a drive's performance(see Figure 2).andP;  The Toshiba-based drives showed the fastest access times aswell as the best overall real-word performance.andP;  Denon's DRD-253 had theslowest average access time, much greater than the maximum time for mostdrives.andP;  The OMI ProCDP's times were surprisingly slow, considering how wellit did in our real-world tests.andM;Throughput cannot be increased beyond 153K per second, the limit set by theSony-Philips Red Book standard.andP;  Most drives achieved this rate, thoughApple's and NEC's lagged a bit behind.andP;  Denon's again pulled in last: Itsthroughput chugged along at only 86K per second.andM;Slow PerfectionandM;If a manufacturer decided to embark on a quest for the perfect CD-ROM drive-- while still obeying the Red and Yellow Book standards -- what's the bestperformance it could expect?andP;  If access time could be shrunk to zero, thedrive would always operate at its maximum throughput rate -- about 9.2megabytes per minute.andP;  This hypothetical CD-ROM drive would be more thantwice as fast as the fastest tape drives, which rumble along at 3.6 megabytesper minute.andP;  No CD-ROM drive will ever be a threat to the hard-driveindustry, however.andP;  The Quantum Pro80 packed into each high-end Mac, forexample, can reach speeds of more than 50 megabytes per minute.andP;  Even theperfect CD-ROM would be left floundring in its wake.andM;To approach the ideal CD-ROM speed, several things could be done.andP;  First, amanufacturer could improve access time by speeding up the rate at which theoptical head moved back and forth while searching for a particular block ofdata (see the &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andP;  Unlike a tiny hard-drive head,however, an optical head is a bulky device containing a semiconductor laser,a lens, a prism, and assorted electronics.andP;  The heavier the head, the moreenergy it takes to control it.andP;  Toshiba's drive overcomes the head's mass(and achieves its quick access time) by delivering more push-pull power--abit like putting a bigger engine into your old Camaro.andP;  The same rapid accessalso could be achieved by decreasing the mass of the optical head--andsomeday a CD-ROM-drive designer should do both.andM;Another area for improvement is in the motor that spins the disc.andO;Information is encoded on both audio CDs and CD-ROMs in a three-mile-longspiral of evenly spaced, infinitesimal pits (see the &quot;It's the Pits&quot;sidebar).andP;  To keep data flowing into the Mac at the proper rate, this spiralmust pass under the read head at a constant speed.andP;  And because the outsideof a rotating disc moves faster than the inside (remember the playgroundmerry-go-round you rode as a child?), the disc must spin faster as the headmoves toward the center and slower as the head moves outward.andP;  An improvementin the drive's ability to change speeds rapidly, coupled with quicker accesstimes, would help approach the CD-ROM ideal.andM;The Sound of MusicandM;The standardization that keeps CD-ROM slow also ensures that all CD-ROMdrives can play audio CDs, which is handy for multimedia developers, musicstudios, and people who like to play music while they work.andP;  (We used a CD ofthe London Symphony playing Mahler's Second for our highly subjective test ofeach drive's audio capabilities.)andP;  But before you start stacking audio discsnext to your Mac, there's a slight catch.andM;Five of the sic drives must be controlled by a Mac to function as audio CDplayers.andP;  Only the Denon DRD-253 can be used as a stand-alone player and thatonly after you've disconnected it from the Mac and reset a bank of DIPswitches.andP;  Of the five that require Mac connection, only two -- the AppleCDSC and NEC CDR-77 -- provide the required software.andP;  The other drivemanufacturers recommend that you cajole your Apple dealer into giving you acopy of CD Remote, Apple's audio software.andP;  And even if you can score a copy,there's no guarantee that the other drives will use all its featurescorrectly.andM;CD Remote is a clever DA that looks and acts like a remote-control device foran audio CD player (see Figure 3).andP;  If you type in the disc's name and tracktitles and save your list when you close the DA, it will create a file thatremembers what you entered.andP;  The next time you insert the disc, CD Remotewill display the titles and let you select what you wish to hear.andM;NEC's less attractive audio controller, Music Box, is not a DA and lacks thetrack-labeling ability of Apple's CD Remote.andP;  NEC also supplies twoutilities, NecCdPlay and NecCdStop, that start and stop audio play.andO;Unfortunately, none of the NEC programs can run in the background, even underMultiFinder, while you're using your Mac.andP;  essentially, your Mac becomes theworld's most expensive CD player.andM;The best drive for music is OMI's ProCDP.andP;  This 19-inch rack-mountable modelis aimed at the professional music studio or CD-ROM developer's lab and hasquarter-inch stereo and headphone jacks.andP;  (If you're really serious aboutaudio CD, check out OMI's stand-alone professional model, the Combo ProCDPfor $2,495.andP;  It has built-in audio-control hardware and an RS-422 keyboardinterface.)andM;The Denon DRD-253 is the only drive with a built-in speaker.andP;  Granted, itstinny monaural sound won't win any hi-fi awards (it makes the London Symphonysound as though it's playing kazoos), but it is handy to hear the audiowithout headphones when you're designing multi-media presentations.andM;Most of the other drives have a pair of RCA jacks for preamp stereo outputand an eighth-inch miniheadphone jack on the front.andP;  Unfortunately, the fast,inexpensive Toshiba-based drives (Toshiba XM-3201 A1 MAC and CD TechnologyPorta-Drive) are the least suited for audio.andP;  They have no stereo jacks toconnect to an amplifier, only a miniheadphone jack.andP;  In addition, the volumecontrol on both models is a crude slide switch with three positions (soft,not-as-soft, and kind-of-loud).andM;If you own an audio CD player, you'll be aware of one major differencebetween it and a CD-ROM drive: price.andP;  If the hardware is essentially thesame, why are CD-ROM drives so much more expensive?andP;  CD-ROM drives do have afew things audio CD units don't, such as a SCSI interface and theerror-correction circuitry essential for flawless performance.andP;  No one excepta sound engineer is going to complain if one oboe drops out for a millisecondin Mahler's Second, but a misread bit in a database could have a negativeeffect on your career.andP;  The main reason for the price difference is simple:sales volume.andP;  The consumer-electronics industry can sell far more audio CDplayers in one year that the total number of Macs sold to date.andM;ConclusionandM;The past year saw two important developments for Mac CD-ROM.andP;  The firsthigh-quality discs were released that show the technology's true promise, andnew drives appeared that are giving the AppleCD SC a run for its money.andP;  Thiscompetition has spurred innovation and lowered prices.andP;  Competition has alsocaused an increased in performance, but there are absolute limits that can'tbe overcome as long as CD-ROM shares hardware standards with audio CD.andP;  Speedwill improve in the next few years, but it will never approach that of harddrives or nonstandardized optical media.andM;Predictions that a CD-ROM drive will be connected to every Mac are about asaccurate as the predictions of flying cars at the 1939 New York World's Fair.andO;Not every user needs such a drive, just as not every user needs a laserprinter.andP;  But if you can use CD-ROM right now, there's no need to wait anylonger to buy a drive.andP;  CD-ROM drives for the Mac are less expensive, faster,and more convenient than ever before.andM;John Rizzo is MacUser's tecnical editor.andP;  He has covered the development ofoptical drives for more than two years, and he still thinks 650 megabytes isa lot of space.andM;MacUser Labs would like to thank the members of its advisory panel: DavidBowman of Hub Associates and Kevin Countryman.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
