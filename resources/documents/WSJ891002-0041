The increase adds to the roller-coaster picture of European auto sales seen since the beginning of the second quarter. Industry and government statistics from 12 countries that normally account for about 94% of noncommunist Europe's passenger car sales showed new car registrations rose to 1,149,341 in August, up 5% on the year and 22% from July.    The figures were boosted by record August sales in the U.K. of 500,112. That total reflects continuing strength in British consumer demand and aggressive incentive programs by many auto makers.    While the latest month bettered most analysts' expectations, &quot;the general opinion appears to be that the market will now cool off&quot; over the next year and a half before entering another period of steady growth, said one industry observer.    DAIMLER-BENZ'S SPINOFFS    Edzard Reuter, the chairman of Daimler-Benz AG, said there are many potential buyers for parts of Daimler-Benz and Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H., or MBB. Daimler-Benz, a West German aerospace concern, plans to take over state-controlled MBB, but the government is making both companies first spin off certain defense technology activities. Mr. Reuter also said that Airbus Industrie, owned by Aerospatiale SA of France, MBB, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain, should become fully privatized. &quot;We will work decisively to see that it happens,&quot; he said. While British Aerospace is already a private company, and MBB will soon be as well, the French and Spanish companies are state-owned.    BRITISH ELECTRICITY    The British government postponed the sale of the state-owned electricity industry by up to six months; the $32 billion sale had been set to begin next January. The delay was attacked by the opposition Labor Party and widely viewed as a setback to the government, whose ambitious plans to sell electricity and water suppliers to private investors have sparked sharp public criticism.    THE IVORY TRADE    Eugene Lapointe, secretary-general of the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, said nations that manage elephant herds well should be allowed to continue selling ivory for financial reasons. But he was immediately challenged. Philippe Roch of the World Wide Fund for Nature said a total ban was the only answer. &quot;If people understand they cannot buy any ivory object, there will be a real decrease in ivory demand,&quot; he said.    CHINESE GRAIN    China ruled out higher grain imports or a return to Maoist collectives to feed its 1.1 billion people, saying more efficient family farms were the answer. The People's Daily rejected the view that small-scale farming methods had reached the limit of their potential and that China would have to import grain for a long time. Latest official estimates put the 1989 grain harvest at above last year's 394 million tons, but it may not reach the target of 410 million.    SOUTH AFRICAN SPENDING    South Africa's government expenditure is running far ahead of budget, the Reserve Bank said. From April to July, the first four months of the current fiscal year, government expenditure rose 30.7% over the same period last year -- well above the budgeted increase of 15% for the fiscal year as a whole, the bank said. But it said that government revenue had also run ahead of budget in the four months, mainly because of increases in the fuel levy, hikes in the surcharge on imports introduced last year and income from a higher general sales tax.    BERTELSMANN'S SCHEDULE    Bertelsmann AG said its consolidation phase was about to end -- ahead of schedule.    Chairman Mark Woessner said the West German publishing giant's past fiscal year, which ended June 30, &quot;was much better than projected.&quot; He said Bertelsmann's group net income rose 16% to 420 million West German marks ($223.3 million) in fiscal 1989 from 362 million marks in the previous year.    Mr. Woessner said such &quot;excellent&quot; results would help complete the period of consolidation by the end of next fiscal year instead of in three years, as had been planned. This phase started in fiscal 1987 with the acquisition of Doubleday Inc. and RCA/Ariola Records of the U.S.    Despite the near-completion of the consolidation, Bertelsmann will abstain from making any &quot;spectacular&quot; acquisitions in the near future, its chairman said.    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    The Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb near Soviet army units in 1954 to test the effects of the blast, said the armed forces daily Red Star. The newspaper said the bomb was dropped in the south Urals, but it didn't report any casualties or address how the soldiers may have been affected. . . . An Israeli farm settlement in the Gaza Strip has found a way to grow bug-free lettuce in hothouses. The Jerusalem Post said the discovery was a boon for Orthodox Jews who previously soaked lettuce in vinegar and washed it repeatedly to remove all insects, proscribed by dietary laws. </TEXT></DOC>
