The banks closed yesterday were: Alaska National Bank of the North, Fairbanks, Alaska, which had assets of $214.9 million; Western National Bank, Bryan, Texas, which had assets of $19.5 million; First State Bank of Bovina, Bovina, Texas, which had assets of $16.4 million; and New World National Bank, Pittsburgh, which had assets of $12.5 million.    The 11 offices of Alaska National are to reopen no later than Monday as branches of National Bank of Alaska, Anchorage. The failed bank had deposits totaling $201.3 million in 21,000 accounts, including $12.2 million in 149 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance deposit limit of $100,000 per depositor. It was the first Alaskan bank to fail this year.    Western National's sole office, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as a branch of First State Bank in Caldwell, Caldwell, Texas. The failed bank held deposits of $15.4 million in 6,000 accounts, including about $100,000 in 17 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Owners of the uninsured deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of Western National's assets.    The sole office of First State Bank, closed by the Texas banking commissioner, is to reopen today as a branch of First Bank of Muleshoe, Muleshoe, Texas. First State held $14.4 million in 1,900 deposit accounts. A total of 44 banks have failed in Texas this year.    New World National's sole office, closed by the Comptroller's office, is to reopen today as Lincoln National Bank, a newly chartered subsidiary of Equimark Corp., a Pittsburgh-based bank holding company. New World National, which held deposits of $10.8 million in 2,300 accounts, was the first Pennsylvania bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
