Therefore, no environmental impactstatement is required. The proposed action is to decontaminate and decommissionthe Westinghouse Advanced Reactors Division fuel fabrication facilities(the Plutonium Laboratory - Building 7, and the Advanced Fuels Laboratory- Building 8). Decontamination and decommissioning of the facilitieswould require removal of all process equipment, the associated servicelines, and decontamination of the interior surfaces of the buildingsso that the empty buildings could be released for unrestricted use. Radioactivewaste generated during these activities would be transported in licensedcontainers by truck for disposal at the Department's facility at Hanford,Washington. Useable non-radioactive materials would be sold as excessmaterial, and non-radioactive waste would be disposed of by burial assanitary landfill at an approved site.</TEXT></DOC>
