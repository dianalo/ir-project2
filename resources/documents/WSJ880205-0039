Garcia </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices were little changed in relatively quiet trading yesterday, as many investors again retired to the sidelines to await today's January employment report and next week's merchandise-trade data.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved in a moderate 20-point range, finishing down 1 at 1923.57. The reduced volatility was welcomed by many traders and analysts.    Among the broader market indexes, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index was unchanged at 252.21 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.08 to 141.89. It was basically a draw between gainers and losers on the Big Board, as 752 issues advanced and 756 declined. Volume contracted to 186.5 million shares from 237.3 million.    &quot;These days, brokers are in dire straits,&quot; said Thom Brown, chairman of the investment policy committee at Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia. &quot;Nobody wants to buy and nobody wants to sell.&quot;    The Labor Department's report on employment is expected to show that a moderate number of new jobs were created last month, although the jobless rate might have ticked up from December's 5.8% rate, according to analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. The trade-deficit report for December, due next Friday, is expected to show a slight worsening from the $13.2 billion gap in November.    &quot;People are finding all sorts of excuses not to invest at the present time. Brokers are being pressed to visit clients and keep calling them with investment ideas,&quot; said Peter J. DaPuzzo, senior executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton.    He noted that &quot;even stocks with stories aren't holding their gains.&quot; For instance, last week Monsanto ran up to 87 1/4 after the company announced that its Nutrasweet division had developed a low-calorie, low-cholesterol fat substitute. Yesterday, the stock closed at 83 3/4, down 1 5/8.    &quot;This is how it's going to be for the next few months&quot; until there is a clear sense of the economy's direction, added Donald Crooks in the equity trading department at Morgan Stanley.    Other traders said the market's increasing volatile moves since the crash are keeping their clients on the sidelines. The New York Stock Exchange, moving to provide some relief, voted yesterday to prohibit member firms from using its SuperDot automated order execution system for index arbitrage programs when the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved more than 50 points from the previous day's close.    More than 34.6 million shares of General Motors changed hands, making it the most-active Big Board issue yesterday as investors reached for the stock's 7.6% dividend yield. The shares, which begin trading ex-dividend today, closed up 1/8 at 65 1/2.    Major department-store chains reported that January sales were unchanged to slightly higher. Investors weren't cheered by the news. Analysts said that because many stores have clearance sales in January to move out remaining fall merchandise, the sales figures for the month aren't a reliable indication of consumer demand.    Sears was unchanged at 34 1/2; J.C. Penney eased 1/8 to 42; K mart dropped 5/8 to 30 7/8; May Department Stores fell 3/4 to 34; Limited decreased 1 3/8 to 17 1/4 in active trading; and Wal-Mart lost 1/4 to 25 7/8.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific declined 5/8 to 43 on more than 2.5 million shares, about four times the stock's usual volume. Robert Willens, a tax consultant at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said some of the activity in Santa Fe might have been caused by individual investors who might want to avoid collecting a special $30 dividend that the company will be paying out to stock of record today. The dividend is part of the company's leveraged recapitalization plan.    Mr. Willens explained that once payment of the special two-part dividend is completed March 1, the stock price is likely to drop by the same amount. That would leave some individual investors with a capital loss they might not want.    It was thumbs down again for companies that came out with disappointing quarterly earnings report.    Chrysler said its fourth-quarter profit rose to $1.57 a share from $1.48, but the results were at the low end of the range of $1.50 to $2.12 that Wall Street analysts had anticipated. The auto maker's shares fell 1 to 26.    General Re reported a 34% earnings gain for the fourth quarter, but it also disclosed that domestic property-casualty insurance underwritings fell 24.7% in the same period. The news derailed the stock, which closed down 4 5/8 to 50 7/8 on more than 1.7 million shares. The company's fourth-quarter net income rose to $1.37 a share from 98 cents a share in the 1986 final quarter.    Federated Department Stores declined 3/4 to 56 1/4 on more than 6.4 million shares. Late Wednesday, Campeau Corp., the Toronto-based real estate concern, boosted its bid for the retailer to $61 a share from $47 a share, if an agreement is reached by 5 p.m. EST tomorrow.    First Boston rose 7/8 to 23 3/4. Two of the investment firm's clients said they would continue their relationships with Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, the mergers and acquisition specialists that left the Wall Street house earlier this week to establish their own firm.    Pannill Knitting, one of the hot stocks of 1986, said it's no longer considering selling the company because of market and industry conditions. It had begun the process last September. The stock sank 7/8 to 6 3/4. The stock was originally issued at $21 a share.    Standard Microsystems tumbled 1 5/8 to 6 in active over-the-counter trading. SMC Acquisitions, as part of a standstill agreement, terminated its unsolicited tender offer for the company and agreed not to buy any additional shares until Feb. 1, 1993.    Aluminum Co. of America moved up 1 5/8 to 41 1/4; Phelps Dodge gained 1 1/2 to 36 1/4; and Reynolds Metals added 1 1/8 to 38 3/8. Kidder Peabody raised its investment rating on these stocks. These issues had been depressed earlier this week as inflation fears receded and commodity prices fell.    General Development added 7/8 to 15 and Zayre inched up 1/8 to 18 7/8. Both stocks have moved up in recent days on takeover speculation. </TEXT></DOC>
