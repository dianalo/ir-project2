Stelzer's Jan. 7 editorial-page article on electric utilities have a very familiar ring. With minor variations, the article is the same old song that has been sung repeatedly during the past 12 years or so by utilities, by the Committee on Energy Awareness, by the Atomic Industrial Forum, and by nuclear-plant contractors and suppliers -- as well as consultants making big bucks from utilities. It goes like this: There is a power shortage not too far off, so we'd better start building more nuclear plants right now. Since 1975 there has been an almost continuous barrage of similar forecasts -- all of which were wrong. All this as excess capacity grew to record highs and annual load growth diminished.    Mr. Stelzer writes, &quot;Harvard researchers, after an exhaustive study of the likely course of future demand, have concluded that 'there is reasonable cause for concern about the ability of the power industry to satisfy electricity demand in the 1990s without incurring shortages, price increases above and beyond those predicted, or other severe measures to limit demand.' Yet no utility would even consider starting a nuclear plant.&quot; Thank heaven. There is no earthly reason to repeat the mistakes of the recent past and start building more nuclear plants that could again easily turn into more economic white elephants. I always supported nuclear power when it was economical. At present, it simply is not.    Mr. Stelzer laments that utilities were forced to lower their load forecasts. Why not? They lost their forecasting credibility by being wrong (on the high side) 10 years in a row.    Mr. Stelzer talks of regulators forcing utilities to the edge of bankruptcy with niggardly rate increases. Why then are so many of them currently awash in cash as well as excess capacity? Why then, according to McGraw-Hill (Electric Utility Week, 1/12/87), did electric utilities lead the stock market in 1986?    Right now, the real reserve electric capacity (not what is reported) is at least 40%, perhaps more, a figure so large that the industry simply changed the formula for computing it to produce a lower figure and avoid some embarrassment.    Mr. Stelzer writes, &quot;. . . serious students of the industry are getting nervous about the long-term prospects for a supply of reliable, efficient energy.&quot; Well, here is one serious student of the industry with real-world credentials who has been consistently right on the U.S. electric supply/demand situation for the past 12 years who is not nervous at all. The reason is clear: The modular approach to future power supply additions employing highly efficient steam/gas cycles in packages of 200 to 300 megawatts can easily cope with future demand. That way, construction schedules are shortened and the vagaries of forecasting are eliminated.    Someday, I suppose, like the fellow standing on the corner predicting the next earthquake or the end of the world, the power-shortage doomsayers may eventually be right. Meanwhile, there is no U.S. power-supply problem on the horizon that a rational application of sound engineering economics cannot solve. The financial community seems not to understand this, perhaps because it makes so much more money the old way, financing those 1,000-megawatt dinosaurs that take eight to 12 years to build.    We agree with Mr. Stelzer that utilities will have to live with competition. With the deregulation of power generation and access to transmission, these perceived problems they are so worried about up at Harvard will fade away like an old soldier.    Joseph M.
