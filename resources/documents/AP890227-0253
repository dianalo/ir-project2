The writer of the best-selling police stories, ``The OnionField'' and ``The Choir Boys,'' headed for Leicester, the Englishcity where the murders took place. He conducted extensive interviewswith local police, the victims' families and others, and used theinformation for the basis of his new book, ``The Blooding'' ($18.95,William Morrow), a non-fictional account of what happened.   But the book's graphic details of the rapes and murders of LyndaMann and Dawn Ashworth have prompted Leicester police to look intohow Wambaugh acquired his information. They said ``The Blooding''contains ``distasteful'' details that could cause further distressto the families involved.   Wambaugh seemed visibly shaken by the investigation when hetalked about the issue in a recent interview.   ``It's very upsetting, it's keeping me up at nights,'' said the52-year-old writer.   ``I'm worried that the parents, once they start down the slope ofpublicly complaining about the treatment of their private lives,will not be able to retreat back to common sense when they read andunderstand what I've done.''   Chief Constable Michael Hirst of the Leicester County police haswritten to the book's British publishers, Bantam, about the book'sclosely detailed description of the attacks on Mann and Ashworth,both 15 when they died.   The parents of one of the girls had complained to Hirst, and toavoid any suggestion that the police endorsed the book, Hirst askedBantam to remove an acknowledgment of the constabulary's help fromthe book.   Bantam said Hirst's letter arrived after the book was printed,and it was too late to remove the acknowledgment.   Wambaugh contacted Robin and Barbara Ashworth but has been unableto alleviate the situation.   ``I'm trying desperately,'' he said. ``I've written two lettersand have gotten one response, which was not good from my point ofview. I just feel that Robin Ashworth has gone down the road too farwith the poisoned atmosphere and will be unable to read the workobjectively.   ``As we sat and talked together, repeatedly they uttered the samethings, that it's not knowing that's the most awful thing. Veryoften we let our imaginations run wild and if we know we can lay theghosts to rest and finish it off. Well I told them what happened.''   On the evening of Nov. 21, 1983, Mann was raped and murdered inthe village of Narborough while walking down a dark footpath calledthe ``Black Pad.'' Despite an exhaustive police investigation, themurderer was not captured and the incident faded into the background.   But nearly three years later the killer struck again, this timein broad daylight, when Dawn Ashworth was raped and murdered whilewalking on a village footpath called ``Ten Pound Lane.'' Policereceived a tip about the suspicious behavior of a kitchen porter, aconfession was obtained and the case seemed to be finally settled.   However, the kitchen porter's father had read about a scientificbreakthrough called genetic fingerprinting, developed in themid-1980s by Leicester geneticist Alec Jeffreys, who discovered thatevery person's blood or semen has a genetic code as distinctive as afingerprint.   A sample of the kitchen porter's blood was taken and the testshowed that his genetic print did not match the semen samples takenfrom the bodies of the two girls.   The police launched a massive ``blooding'' program, testing everymale in the vicinity who was born between Jan. 1, 1953 and Dec. 31,1970. When an employee at a local bakery revealed that he had beenpersuaded by Colin Pitchfork, a co-worker, to take the test for him,police tracked down the suspect. Pitchfork was tested and chargedwith the murders.   Wambaugh tells the story in a matter-of-fact manner. The rapesare depicted in detail, reading like a well prepared police report.There is no real ``message'' in ``The Blooding,'' outside of howgenetic fingerprinting could revolutionize crime detection and thatPitchfork was a sociopath, incapable of feeling remorse for thecrimes.   ``If there was one single British writer doing a book I was goingto back off. I thought, `It's their country, their story and one ofthem should do it. I didn't want to be some carpetbagging Yank.''   But the author didn't anticipate certain cultural differences,especially the British need for privacy.   ``They are reticent people who consider keeping one's mouth shuta major virtue. With Americans, once they start you can't shut themup. But the Brits are different. I spent a lot of money on drinksfor a lot of people to get information I needed. I've done a bookthat they're not familiar with. They don't like non-fiction crime;it does not sell well in England.''   Wambaugh's own interest in the genre came from reading TrumanCapote's 1965 classic, ``In Cold Blood.''   ``There was his book and there weren't too many others,''Wambaugh said. ``I was impressed that it could be written exactly inthe style of a novel and be exactly true journalistically.''   Wambaugh, the son of a police officer, lived in East Pittsburghuntil he was 14 and his family moved to Los Angeles. At age 20, hedeveloped an interest in literature but decided to become a copbecause he needed a job and the pay was good. But he didn't give uphis desire to write.   ``The everyday policeman's routine is very rarely exciting andvery rarely satisfying,'' Wambaugh said. ``But when I'd get home atnight or daytime, depending on the shift I worked, I started on thattypewriter. Then I was challenged.''   His first novel, ``The New Centurions,'' was released in 1971.Based on his own experiences, it was a fictionalized account of aLos Angeles policeman's first five years on the force, culminatingwith the 1965 race riots in Watts.   The book sold well and his next novel, ``The Blue Knight,'' dideven better, selling over 1 million copies in paperback alone. ``TheOnion Field,'' released in 1973, was a non-fictional story about themurder of a police officer in an isolated onion field nearBakersfield, Calif. A critical and commercial success, Wambaughconsidered ``The Onion Field'' a major breakthrough.   ``From `Onion Field' on I've really grown,'' said Wambaugh, whoretired from the Los Angeles police force in March 1973 after 13years on the force.   He has written 11 books, seven fiction and four non-fiction.   ``They're both true kinds of writing. Stylistically, I write thesame. I learned that from Capote; you can write the same as long asyou have integrity and don't start writing fiction in a non-fictionstory.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 10-12</NOTE></DOC>
