Student leaders on Tuesday considered ending their 10-dayoccupation of Tiananmen Square.   Soldiers clashed briefly Monday night with residents 15 milesfrom the square, but no shooting was reported. Other troopswithdrew from streets in southern Beijing, ending standoffs withlocal residents who have surrounded their convoys and blocked theirmovement.   Students who have guided the tumultuous pro-democracy movementover the past month expressed concern that many Beijing studentswere leaving and that half their numbers were now students fromoutside the city.   Beijing University student leader Gua Haifeng said some leaderswant to pull out because of the increasingly squalid conditions andthe lack of clear-cut results from the occupation.   Others argued they should stay until they achieve victory intheir struggle with the government, stressing that the studentsstill have the strong support of city residents.   About 45,000 people were on the 100-acre square Tuesday morning.A soldier from the western province of Xinjiang praised thestudents' ``revolutionary, patriotic, democratic movement'' in aspeech over loudspeakers.   A mother was seen weeping in the arms of her daughter, pleadingwith her to come home.   The promise by the military not to attack protesters representeda serious blow to Premier Li Peng and other hardliners who havetried to quell the huge demonstrations.   Sources said members of the National People's Congress, China'slegislature, began gathering signatures needed to convene a specialsession on the legality of martial law, indicating a furthererosion of Li's support.   In Washington, the Voice of America said Chinese authoritieswere jamming its broadcasts, apparently trying to cut off one ofthe demonstrators' main sources of information. It was the firstreported case of jamming since before diplomatic relations wererestored in 1979.   Soldiers withdrew from streets in southern Beijing to endstandoffs with residents who had surrounded military convoys forthe last three days.   Army trucks and armored vehicles remained deployed elsewhere inwestern and southern parts of the city, but the mood was generallyrelaxed. State television quoted an officer as saying he was toldto withdraw because of the widespread opposition to martial law.   Residents and soldiers clashed briefly in one area when thesoldiers tried to move to a nearby army storage facility.   People surrounding the trucks tried to block their path and abattle with rocks and bricks began.   An unconfirmed report said a soldier was killed, and one reportsaid 15 residents were injured. A Chinese journalist said about2,000 soldiers participated in the clash.   The confrontation, which ended at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, occurred15 miles southwest of Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, wheretens of thousands of students have held round-the-clock vigils indefiance of martial law.   Citizens have set up barricades throughout the city to keepsoldiers from moving on the students.   What caused the clash was not clear. Witnesses said soldiers hitpeople with sticks and belts but did not open fire. The witnesessaid some soldiers pushed through throngs of residents trying toblock their way but that military vehicles did not advance.   There were new signs of internal political struggle.   The letter from military leaders, which was sent to the People'sDaily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, was drafted byseven prominent military figures, a source at the People's Dailysaid. The seven include former Defense Minister Zhang and formerarmy Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi.   ``As old soldiers we have the following demands,'' the lettersaid. ``The People's Liberation Army belongs to the people. Itcannot confront the people, even more so it cannot suppress thepeople and it will never shoot the people.   ``To keep the situation from worsening, the army cannot enterthe city.'' The letter was signed by 100 other officers, saidanother source.   Li's inability to enforce martial law indicated an intense powerstruggle. Li emerged as a hardliner during the protests andappeared to have won a power struggle with Communist Party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang, who was more sympathetic to the students'demands.   Chinese sources said Zhao has resigned in protest, but noofficial statement has been made and his whereabouts and statusremain unclear.   The students began leading the protests on April 15 to demandtalks with the government on bringing democratic reforms and endingofficial profiteering. But now the students _ bolstered bywidespread support their movement has won from the populace _ arepressing for the resignations of Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping.   The protests reached a zenith last week during the historicvisit to China by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose socialreforms are admired by reform-minded Chinese.   Students began a hunger strike May 13, two days beforeGorbachev's arrival. The populace embraced the students' cause andpoured into the streets, resulting in crowds estimated at more than1 million.   Under martial law, the city government banned marches, strikes,class boycotts, the spreading of rumors and any criticism ofleaders. The bans were widely ignored.   Foreign reporters were told they could not conduct interviews,take pictures or make tapes or videos on the streets, in workplaces and at several other locations.</TEXT></DOC>
