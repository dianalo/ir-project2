Concern about adverse effects on healthfrom exposure to asbestos originally centered on miners, insulation workers,and others who were exposed to large amounts of asbestos in their jobs.But recent studies indicate that even low levels of airborne asbestosmay cause cancer, and concern has mounted over the effects on the generalpublic of exposure to asbestos in the environment. Because most of themethods that were developed for the analysis of bulk asbestos samplesare not appropriate for the analysis of air samples, new methods capableof detecting small amounts of asbestos in ambient air have been developed.These new methods are described.</TEXT></DOC>
