But the compliance program only applies to those makingless than $100,000.;    &quot;Even if high-income non-filers eventually file taxreturns, their returns get less scrutiny than those who file on time,&quot; thestudy said.;    The GAO blamed the problem on IRS estimates that understate byas much as two-thirds the amount of money that can be recovered from thewealthier non-filers. Consequently, many of the cases are not a highpriority.;    But even if the estimates were revised and the cases assigned ahigher priority, the GAO said, the IRS lacks the staff to pursue more of theprosperous non-filers.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  R.A.
