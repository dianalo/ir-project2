Two process elements known to exhibit thisholdup are uranium getter pumps (U-beds) and molecular sieve traps. Methodsfor measurement of holdup on these process elements are presented basedon isotopic dilution (H or D). For the U-beds, a qualified method forprediction of holdup is presented based on the flow rate as a functionof time for the evolved gas. The method is noninvasive, uses data fromthe normal inventory bakeoff and allows a shortened bakeoff period forinventory measurement. 6 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
