A composite index of nine framing-lumber products, trackedby Random Lengths Publications Inc., hit $303 per 1,000 boardfeet Friday, exceeding the previous record of $300 Aug. 24,1979. Similarly, an index of plywood products climbed to $282per 1,000 square feet, one of the highest levels recorded butnot a record. The figures haven't been adjusted forinflation. Prices of specific products have jumped in thepast two weeks. Two-by-fours have risen 17.5% and half-inchplywood, 19.2%.</LP><TEXT>   Some wood-products companies believe the surge reflectsthe beginning of a long cycle of improved prices and profitsfor the industry, after last year's severe slump. But otherscaution that real demand, as evidenced by a strong recoveryin construction, is needed to sustain the rally. So far, therecovery is very tentative.   Lumber companies and analysts said the major impetus hasbeen more the fear of impending shortages, rather than actualdemand-supply imbalances. Last month, a federal judgeprohibited the federal government from selling any moretimber on 66,000 acres of forests in California, Oregon andWashington, pending the outcome of litigation to protect thehabitat of the spotted owl. Meanwhile, the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service is working out details of its recent owlproposal, which could limit logging on some or all of the11.6 million acres it regards as prime owl habitat. Previouscourt decisions regarding the owl also limited cutting.   The ban removes about 77% of all the land identified bythe National Forest Service for timber harvest in theNorthwest, according to an agency spokesman. Companies canstill harvest 4.77 billion board feet under current contract,an estimated 18-month supply, but no new contracts are beingissued.   &quot;The short-term effects of that decision are a littlescary,&quot; said Richard S. Schneider, an analyst with Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;Some of the concern is reasonable, but part ofthe price rise comes from people scrambling for product sothey won't be left without raw materials.&quot;   Many speculators and traders have concluded thatenvironmentalists have gained the upper hand in theNorthwest. In a similar dispute in the 1970s, regionalpoliticians obtained an exemption of the snaildarter fishfrom the endangered-species list so that construction ofTennessee's Tellico Dam could proceed. But this is adifferent era. Northwest politicians face a less receptiveaudience in Congress. While a compromise may yet occur, it isstill expected to limit cutting significantly.   &quot;The timber under contract is fine for now, but for thefuture, those areas could be lost or greatly reduced by 50%or more,&quot; said George A. Haloulakos, an analyst with DainBosworth Inc. in Seattle.   The psychological effect of the spotted-owl decision hasbeen compounded by other events limiting supply, such asheavy rains in the South and reductions in milling capacityin the Northwest. Overall, Northwest lumber production isalready down 19% from last year.   Adding fuel to the speculative fire is a seasonalresurgence of demand related mainly to remodeling andnew-home construction. FW Dodge, the market research divisionof McGraw Hill andamp; Co., reported a 12% rise in constructionactivity in April. Housing starts in particular turned upslightly this spring from near-record lows.   Walter C. Minnick, chairman and chief executive officer ofTJ International, a custom lumber maker in Boise, Idaho, saidhe put aside fears of a continued recession when ordersdoubled in March from the rate of preceding months. &quot;We sawthe bottom of the trough in December, and now we're at thestart of an upward cycle that could last for about fiveyears,&quot; he said.   &quot;Order activity for wood windows and housing relatedmaterials is up,&quot; said Mr. Haloulakos, the Dain Bosworthanalyst. &quot;Lower interest rates, higher levels of consumerconfidence, and after all the uncertainty from the war, alittle pent-up demand is starting to emerge,&quot; he said, addingthat he believes the forest products industry is poised for&quot;a multiyear move&quot; toward bigger profits.   Forest-products companies with big timber holdings, suchas Weyerhaeuser Co., Louisiana-Pacific Corp. and PotlatchCorp., are expected to benefit from the price surge becausethey can avoid increases in raw-material costs while chargingmore for finished wood products. Weyerhaeuser's stock hasjumped 45% from its low in January, while Louisiana-Pacific'sstock increased 58% and Potlatch's stock has risen 51%.   But construction, particularly of new homes, apartmenthouses and small retail structures, is still deeplydepressed, causing some veteran lumber executives to doubtthe sustainability of the price rally. Peter P. Pope,chairman and chief executive officer of Pope andamp; Talbot Inc.,Portland, Ore., says a recovery in housing starts to roughly1.5 million is needed to prop up high prices. In April, theseasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts wasslightly more than one million.   If such a housing recovery does occur, a real shortagelooms, according to L. Penn Siegel, the director ofPotlatch's wood-products division. &quot;I don't think we haveenough timber when you reach a level of 1.3 million to 1.4million {annual} housing starts,&quot; he said.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders will continue to watch for signs that the WhiteHouse is inching closer to granting Moscow $1.5 billion inexport credit guarantees.   The White House has been mulling the widely expected aidpackage to the cashstrapped Soviet Union for several weeks.According to analysts, U.S. grain exports will continue to bedepressed until Moscow gets financial backing to resume itsfood purchases. The Soviet Union had been one of the biggestbuyers of U.S. grain until its economic troubles.   This week analysts will also watch whether farmers inwaterlogged Iowa and Minnesota are able to complete theplanting of their corn crop. The deadline for planting cornis generally early June. Traders are particularly concernedabout the delays in Iowa because its flat black land is someof the most productive in the world.   The warm wet spring is also causing problems with the softred winter wheat crop in states such as Illinois. A fungusoutbreak is reducing potential yields and damaging thequality of the crop.   After the close of trading tomorrow the AgricultureDepartment is slated to release its update of the totalwinter wheat harvest, which is already under way in somestates.   Dale Durchholz, an analyst at AgriVisor Services Inc.,said he expects the government to predict a winter wheat cropof 1.49 billion bushels, which is little changed from thegovernment's May estimate.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Traders will be watching the silver market to determinewhether last week's rally has any steam left in it. &quot;Theperformance of the market early this week will be critical,&quot;said William O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch.   Silver for July delivery surged 24.5 cents an ounceThursday and jumped an additional 21 cents to a high of $4.64Friday before ending at $4.47, up four cents.   Much of Thursday's activity was said to be short-covering,or traders buying contracts to offset previous bets the pricewould fall. Short-covering reduces the number of outstandingcontracts, but this figure, called &quot;open interest,&quot; roseThursday by 11,738 to 111,167, indicating new buying, saidMr. O'Neill.   A rising open interest during a period of heavy trading isusually a bullish indicator, he said. But if the price beginsto fall, he warned, these new investors may bail out quickly,adding to the selling pressure.   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber,finds the rise in open interest troubling, especially iffunds were buying and producers were selling. Funds buy andsell based on technical reasons, while producers base tradeson fundamental factors, he said. If technical indicatorsdictate the funds stop buying, and producers continueselling, silver &quot;could come down like a house of cards,&quot; Mr.Savaiko said.   In that case, the price could easily drop to $4.25 to$4.35 an ounce, and even as low as $4, he said.   The market needs to hold onto its gains this week, &quot;or itcould be in trouble from a technical viewpoint,&quot; Mr. O'Neillsaid.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Coffee futures fell sharply Friday on technical factors.Coffee for July delivery fell 2.4 cents a pound to 85.60cents.   Talk about possible cold weather in Brazil sparked a smallrally last week, said Celeste Georgakis, senior analyst atCargill Investor Services.   But when the July contract failed to rise above 89 cents,an important resistance level, speculators and funds beganselling, said Ms. Georgakis. The fall was accelerated as theprice hit levels that triggered standing sell orders.   Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch, added thatprices fell in spite of news that unions at a Brazilian porthad gone out on strike. Although the two strikes don't affectcoffee exports significantly, they suggest that negotiationsunder way at major coffee ports might also break down, shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
