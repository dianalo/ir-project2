Bow Valley, based in Calgary, Alberta, said the write-downwill result in an after-tax charge against its 1991 earningsand a loss for the year.</LP><TEXT>   Bow Valley said that about C$180 million of the write-downis related directly to low commodity prices, while C$50million is accounted for by revisions to its reserves of oiland gas. The remainder represents a C$20 million write-downof its Whiterose property, off Canada's eastern coast, andunsuccessful exploration projects.   The company said it expects to release its 1991 resultsaround Feb. 14. It said the write-downs, which industryanalysts had expected, will have a positive effect on thecompany's future net income and return on capital, due tolower depreciation and depletion charges.   In 1990, Bow Valley had net of C$49.7 million, or 47 centsa share. Company officials had said earlier that they didn'texpect 1991 results to match those of 1990.
