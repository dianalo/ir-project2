Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   For International Business Machines Corp.'s customers, who do business with one of the world's most formidable bureaucracies, last week's big reorganization of IBM sounded like welcome news.    Lots of IBM customers tell war stories about exactly the troubles Chairman John Akers is contending with by decentralizing decision-making at the computer giant: problems that get lost in layers of IBM officialdom, and product requirements that IBM inventors never find out about.    Their reactions point up Mr. Akers's diagnostic skills as he struggles to reverse three years of disappointing earnings. They also point up the deep structural flaws inside IBM that his ambitious scheme is up against.    &quot;This inevitably is going to help reduce the layers,&quot; said John Rogers, the technology chief at Bank of Boston Corp. In the past, he said, &quot;You had the feeling the guy you were talking to had to talk to 4,673 other people before he got the best answer he could come up with, which may not have been straight.&quot;    Calvin Rader, a Delta Air Lines computer manager, described a typical IBM customer complaint. He buys personal computer networks from IBM, adds software and resells them to travel agents. Mr. Rader said he ran into a scheduling disaster last year when IBM couldn't deliver a crucial adapter board, and he couldn't find the right manager to help him.    &quot;To get to the decision-makers who could make things happen, you had to go up two or three different avenues,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm quite sure there was someone within the IBM structure that could have just reached in and fixed it.&quot;    Mr. Rader said he thinks IBM's move to shift authority from its headquarters office to its six main business groups could help prevent such logjams. &quot;It's a classic management change and I've seen it work at other companies,&quot; he said.    Customers have lots of questions about IBM's overhaul, which Mr. Akers called the most sweeping in six years. Kavin Moody, the top computer executive at Gillette Co., wondered whether giving IBM's groups more independence and authority will aggravate one of the company's most serious woes: it's too hard to link up all the different models of IBM computers.    Mr. Akers addressed that question when he unveiled the new IBM last Thursday. He said IBM's master plan for connecting all its product lines is one responsibility that headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., won't be delegating away. Still, he allowed, &quot;Every organization solves some problems and creates some problems.&quot;    Others questioned whether the changes cut deep enough. &quot;Is he just shuffling the deck or is this going to be a meaningful change?&quot; asked DuWayne Peterson, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s executive vice president in charge of technology. &quot;I'm 50-50 on that.&quot;    Mr. Peterson was one of several IBM customers who said the company already started to make big strides last year in becoming easier to deal with. Mr. Akers christened 1987 &quot;The Year of the Customer&quot; and took pains to have IBM managers work more closely with computer buyers.    For Mr. Peterson, that meant assigning him a senior executive responsible for untangling any bureaucratic mess Merrill Lynch encountered at IBM. He said this move is making Merrill Lynch's current effort to install new personal computers in every branch office much easier than a similar effort in 1985.    &quot;That didn't get the attention inside IBM we've gotten now,&quot; he said. &quot;IBM's a massive organization, and you have to continually pound on those guys to get your message across. If you sit back and assume IBM will naturally come out with what you need, forget about it.&quot;    Smaller customers than Merrill Lynch -- nearly every IBM customer, in other words -- don't always rate such deluxe hand-holding. John Fischer, vice president of information systems at Western Paper Co., said he's gone through agonizing delays waiting for his local branch office to get approval for a special price.    Sometimes, he said, &quot;they will simply wait so long you have to consider other options without really knowing what IBM's best recommendation for equipment and pricing will be.&quot; A few years ago that very situation spurred him to buy a rival's products in the middle range between PCs and mainframes -- one of IBM's weakest markets right now.    IBM's restructuring should ease that problem, Mr. Fischer predicted, but he doubts the move will change things soon. &quot;It would be wonderful if there were recognizable signs in 18 months that there was a significant difference,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
