The mediator, Bill Kelly, met separately yesterday with representatives of Canada Post Corp. and the 20,000-member Canadian Letter Carriers union. The two sides remain far apart on key issues including working conditions and job security. Their collective agreement expired last December.    Canada Post, the government-owned postal service, said it would stop using replacement workers until next Sunday, or when mediation ends, whichever comes first. The union cut back its rotating strikes, with only Montreal being affected by a work stoppage yesterday.    During the dispute, most major areas have been disrupted by strikes lasting from one to several days. In some cities, striking workers have been arrested or injured when they tried to stop truckloads of replacement workers hired by Canada Post from entering mail-sorting depots. </TEXT></DOC>
