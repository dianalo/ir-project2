The results on muon, electron and pion simulationare reported. The longitudinal development of hadron showers is wellreproduced and saturation effects are also explained. The resolutionof the calorimeter for incident pions as computed by the Monte Carlomethod is slightly larger than what observed.</TEXT></DOC>
