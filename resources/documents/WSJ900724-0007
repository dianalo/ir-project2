Its enemies, on the other hand, never let it down.   Last week's switch by Iraq's Saddam Hussein fromthreatening Israel to intimidating neighboring Kuwait hasshifted the spotlight from Israel to the Arab world'sinternal problems.</LP><TEXT>   Iraq, deep in the red from its war with Iran, wants$25-a-barrel oil to pay its debt and fund its militarybuildup. Kuwait, widely diversified with investments in theWest that benefit from lower oil prices, is happy with themuch-lower world price, recently about $14 a barrel.   This disagreement has reopened an older wound, Iraq'sclaim to sovereignty over Kuwait that predates the desertemirate's independence from Britain in 1961. Then, Iraq wasbought off only after Kuwait paid $84 million, and even so,territorial disputes flared in 1973 and 1976. This time,Kuwait is likely to end up paying much more to appease Iraq-- at least the estimated $10 billion Kuwait lent to Iraq inthe war with Iran.   Meanwhile, the dispute has tied up the diplomatic energiesof Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Tunis-based ArabLeague, much to the despair of many Palestinians. The quarrelis &quot;a stab in the back&quot; says the Palestinian newspaperAsShaab.   But to many Arabs, the Iraqi president's attack on thesumptuously wealthy Persian Gulf leaders plays almost as wellas his earlier verbal attacks on Israel. ImpoverishedEgyptians and Jordanians, in particular, resent gulf wealththat they often see first hand as low paid laborers workingfar from home. Some Arab papers have particularly praised Mr.Hussein's call to use funds from higher oil prices to fund aninter-Arab development agency, although the Kuwait Fund forArab Economic Development already hands out hundreds ofmillions of dollars a year in soft credits on top of generousintergovernmental grants to Arab states.   But even if Kuwait buckles, as is likely, Mr. Hussein'sattack is likely to fuel the arguments of those in Israel andWashington who say the Iraqi leader is beyond the pale ofdiplomatic discourse and unworthy of such favored treatmentas export-import bank credits.   Meanwhile, other inter-Arab rifts -- the bitter feudsbetween Syria's President Hafez Assad and both the PalestineLiberation Organization's Yasser Arafat and Iraq's Mr.Hussein -- also are likely to help Israel's new hard-linegovernment. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, trying to avoidtalks in Cairo with Palestinians designed by the U.S. to helpfurther Mr. Shamir's own plan for Palestinian elections, hasabruptly switched gears and called for talks with Syriainstead.   Mr. Shamir launched the elections proposal 15 months ago,then backed away from any steps that seemed likely to make itfeasible. The new focus on Syria seems designed tomarginalize the Palestinians, distract Washington and createfurther delays.   The wily Mr. Assad has dropped just enough crumbs abouthis desire for peace to give Mr. Shamir's aides something tokeep chewing on. The reason isn't likely to be that Mr. Assadis about to transform into a Sadat-style peace maker. Moreprobably, he enjoys inconveniencing Mr. Arafat, whom he neverhas managed to bring under his control.   Both Messrs. Shamir and Assad welcome anything that delaysan Israeli-Palestinian dialogue: Mr. Shamir, because hebelieves it is in Israel's best interest, Mr. Assad becausehe sees delay as feeding the forces of radicalism andmilitance that he supports within the Palestinian movement.</TEXT></DOC>
