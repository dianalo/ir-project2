The fluence derived distributions are appropriate forcomparison with simultaneous infrared photometry (from Earth) becausethey sample the particles in the same way as the IR data do (along theline of sight) and because they are directly proportional to the concentrationdistribution in that region of the coma which dominates the IR emission.</TEXT></DOC>
