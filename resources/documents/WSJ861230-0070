The funds are what remains of a sum Iran deposited in an account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The deposited funds were part of the settlement of claims that arose in 1979 after American hostages were seized at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the U.S., in response, froze Iranian assets in the U.S. The money was intended to reimburse banks that had lent money to Iran during the rule of the shah, who was ousted in 1979. Iran now is believed to have repaid all the banks.    Representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank and Iran's Bank Markazi met in The Hague yesterday to work out arrangements to transfer the funds back to Iran. U.S. officials said Iran would likely regain the money early in 1987.    The decision is the first signal since the outbreak of the Iran arms scandal that the U.S. intends to continue trying to improve relations with Tehran, one U.S. official said. But Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said that the Reagan administration sees &quot;no link whatsoever&quot; between release of the funds and U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.    She said the current negotiations in the Netherlands are technical meetings -- the third such sessions in three months -- being held in response to a decision last August by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague that the money in the New York Fed account should be returned to Iran because Tehran appears to have met U.S. bank claims.    Iranian officials, including Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Parliament, have said they would be more willing to intercede on behalf of U.S. hostages in Lebanon once U.S.-held Iranian assets are released. An Iranian Embassy spokesman in The Hague told United Press International that return of the $500 million could &quot;positively affect&quot; the people holding the hostages.    But one senior official said the Iranians appear to want U.S. action on several billion dollars in claims by Tehran against the U.S. The official said the U.S. is unlikely to agree to that.    &quot;If the Iranians choose to take our cooperativeness in this technical matter as a positive political gesture, that is their business,&quot; a senior U.S. official said. &quot;The fact is that we don't have any good legal arguments to hold up the money even if that's what we had wanted. We could only have made a bad situation worse by doing so.&quot;    Nevertheless, the Reagan administration is likely to draw criticism for openly negotiating with Tehran so soon after the outbreak of the Iran scandal. One official said the U.S. could have held up the money for several months by raising technical barriers to the settlement. The officials said such delays tacitly would have applied more pressure for the hostages' release, and would have weakened the Iranian economy, which is squeezed by the fall in oil prices at a time when Tehran is preparing a large military offensive against Iraq in its six-year-old war.    Under the agreement that led to the release of U.S. Embassy hostages in Tehran in January 1981, Iran deposited $3.67 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank to pay U.S. members of international bank syndicates that had lent money to Iran during the late shah's rule.    Iran subsequently paid off some loans to non-U.S. members of banking syndicates in an apparent effort to keep a good credit rating. The foreign banks passed a share of the money to their U.S. banking partners. As a result, there was more money in the Fed account than was needed to pay U.S. banks. Including interest, the surplus now exceeds $500 million.    Since 1982, Iran has appealed for return of the surplus money. But U.S. officials have denied Iran had a right to the funds. The U.S., underlining the lack of coordination in its policy toward Iran, stuck to that hard-line position even when the White House in 1985 and 1986 approved weapons sales to Tehran in an effort to improve relations and win release of the hostages held in Lebanon.    The U.S. didn't appear to change its position until August, when the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, the Netherlands-based court that has been untangling the two countries' financial relations since 1981, ruled that Washington should release the money.    The tribunal said that if the two sides couldn't agree by Dec. 20 on a formula for finishing the dispute, either side could return to the tribunal to settle the remaining issues. Neither side has appealed to the tribunal because negotiations continue &quot;on a workmanlike basis,&quot; a U.S. official said. He said two of the main points of difference are the amount of interest due to Iran on the account, and U.S. insistence on provisions that would preclude any future liabilities connected with the account. </TEXT></DOC>
