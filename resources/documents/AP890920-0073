(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dian Fossey's fight to save Africa'smountain gorilla from extinction will be continued by a 33-year-oldNew York woman.   Diane Doran, a researcher at the State University of New York atStony Brook, was chosen from 15 applicants to be the next directorof the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda.   Fossey, who was portrayed in the movie ``Gorillas in the Mist,''set up the center 1967 to study and preserve the mountain gorilla.She was slain in her mountain hut in 1985. Two others have servedtwo-year stints as directors since then.   ``I consider it a privilege,'' said Doran. ``Being able to studyanimals in the wild is magical ... something very few people willever get to do.''   The Digit Fund, an animal conservation organization in Engelwood,Colo., that finances the center, chose Doran in June. The fund isnamed after one of Fossey's favorite gorillas.   A native of Whitesboro in upstate New York near Utica, Doran iscompleting her doctoral thesis comparing pygmied and commonchimpanzees. She has worked in Africa and is fluent in Lingala, anAfrican language.   At the center, Doran will supervise research on the mountaingorilla, assist in conservation efforts and oversee an anti-poachingprogram. She will live alone in a cabin high in the mountains on theborder between Rwanda and Zaire.   Fossey, who studied the mountain gorilla for 20 years, set upanti-poaching patrols to protect the threatened species, of whichabout 300 remain. She became an enemy to poachers who slaughteredthe gorillas and sold their heads and hands to be made into ashtraysand other souvenirs.   Doran said she never met Fossey but admired her pioneering work.``When she went there it was unheard of for a woman or anybody tostudy great apes,'' said Doran.   She said she doesn't fear for her safety because the Rwandanshave become supportive of conservation. Tourists who want to see thegorillas are the country's third-largest source of revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
