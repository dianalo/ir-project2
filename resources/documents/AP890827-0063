The protesters, led by clergy members, gathered in theBensonhurst neighborhood where 16-year-old Yusef Hawkins was shotdead Wednesday as he was confronted by a gang of bat-wielding whites.   The group of about 30 blacks and 70 whites was escorted by 20police on motorcycles and dozens more on foot as about 300 whiteresidents lined the street.   Many residents watched passively from windows and storefrontswhile others walked along the street waving posters in the air andchanting, ``Go home. Go home.''   Some residents shouted, ``Free the boys from Bensonhurst,'' areference to five white youths who have been arrested in theslaying. Others booed the marchers and chanted ``Central Park,Central Park,'' referring to the recent rape and beating of a whitejogger there, allegedly by a gang of blacks and Hispanics. Some madeobscene gestures.   One man was taken into custody but not immediately charged aftera small firecracker was thrown at the demonstrators, said Sgt. EdBurns, a police spokesman.   The protesters, led by the Rev. Timothy Mitchell, chanted,``Whose city? Our city,'' as they walked about 10 blocks from thesite of the killing through the community's streets.   ``New York City is not going to become Johannesburg, SouthAfrica. This is our city and we are going to walk wherever we want.We need to see more of the good people in this community,'' Mitchellsaid at the site of Hawkins' death.   Throughout the march, police blocked streets with barricades toprevent confrontations.   Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of neighborhoodwhites carrying baseball bats, two-by-fours and golf clubs when theyarrived in Brooklyn's mostly Italian-Jewish Bensonhurst section toanswer an advertisement for a used car.   Police said the gang was angered by a local white girl's datingof a black youth, and they gathered with the intention of attackingthe black when he arrived for the girl's birthday party.   A protest march Saturday afternoon by blacks through the mostlywhite neighborhood was greeted with jeers, spitting and racialslurs. Some whites held up watermelons as 300 or so blacks marchedthrough.   Residents also chanted ``Central Park, Central Park'' during thatincident. The blacks answered with ``Howard Beach, Howard Beach,'' areference to the December 1986 killing of Michael Griffith, 23.   ``This is about what we expected,'' said Joseph Calzerano, thepolice department's chief of operations. ``The feelings are runninghigh.''   ``If we didn't do it because of what happened yesterday then itwould be just like South Africa,'' Mitchell said before a briefmemorial service at the site of the killing Sunday.   Five suspects in the attack were arraigned Saturday. Four werereleased Sunday on $75,000 bail; the fifth, Keith Mondello, 18, whomauthorities called the instigator, was released on $100,000 bail.   The other suspects are Steven Curreri, 18; Pasquale Raucci, 19;Charles Stressler, 21; and James Patino, 24.   Meanwhile, police continued looking for 18-year-old Joseph Fama,who was wanted for questioning. News reports have said investigatorsbelieve he was the gunman.   Mondello, Curreri, Raucci and Stressler are charged with assault,aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing andpossession of deadly weapons, the baseball bats. Patino was chargedwith assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civilrights.</TEXT></DOC>
