ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Before George Bush could savor his decisivetriumph in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination,conservatives and moderates launched intensive drives to set thevice president's ideological compass in advance of the fallcampaign.   Conservatives drew up their short list of acceptable runningmates and demanded Bush reassure them he will adhere to theirversion of the Ronald Reagan agenda.   But while the right has been most vocal in pressuring the vicepresident, GOP moderates also are bombarding him with arguments asto why he should shift to the left.   ``The vice president accedes to the right at the risk of his ownindependence and election prospects,'' said Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,an early supporter of Bush in the state where the vice presidentsuffered his most humiliating defeat of the nomination campaign.   The advice comes from a dazzling range of Republican thinking,from Richard M. Nixon; Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a leader ofyoung House conservatives, and a group of Reaganites callingthemselves the Western States Political Caucus to that vanishingbreed of GOP liberals like Leach and Gov. Thomas H. Kean of NewJersey.   The tug-o'-war over Bush reflects widespread uncertainty overhis true views.   Seven years of unswervingly loyal service as Reagan's vicepresident earned Bush valuable conservative support in the race forthe GOP presidential nomination. But to many conservatives heremains suspect, the man who battled Reagan a little too hard and alittle too long for the 1980 nomination, the man who coined thephrase ``voodoo economics,'' supported the Equal Rights Amendmentand was perceived as pro-choice on abortion.   Those who are struggling to move Bush to the left or the rightmay exaggerate the vice president's problems unifying hisRepublican base.   ``George Bush's problem uniting the party is considerably lessthan it was for Ronald Reagan (in 1980),'' said Richard Wirthlin,Reagan's pollster.   ``His big challenge is not in uniting a Republican base,'' saidWirthlin ``but rather in beginning to reach out to the very largenumber of Republicans who will split their tickets and people whodon't have any anchor in either party.''   Said Gingrich, ``It is clear that Bush is a man who was notintrinsically part of the Goldwater-Reagan movement.''   At the same time, the congressman, who supported Rep. Jack Kempof New York for the GOP presidential nomination, described Bush as``broadly conservative'' and added that he demonstrated he ``couldcampaign on Reagan-Kemp issues better than Kemp could.''   Gingrich is making his peace with Bush and has his own advice tooffer, including suggestions that the vice president adopt anagenda the congressman describes as ``humanitarian conservatism''and portray Democrat Michael Dukakis as party of ``the looneyleft.''   He dismissed GOP moderates by saying ``the so-called mainstreamRepublicans are a small trickle.''   Nixon is quoted as advising Bush that he can't win thepresidency with conservatives alone, ``but you can't win theelection without these people.''   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater would turn the vicepresident's fuzziness on issues into an asset.   ``He is the umbrella candidate for the Republican Party,'' saidAtwater. ``He is the single best candidate to represent all thevarying groups inside the Republican Party.''   Atwater contended that polls of Republicans found Bush ``has alion's share of support of moderates, he had a lion's share ofsupport of the conservatives, a lion's share of support of theevangelicals and a lion's share of support of those who callthemselves very conservative.''   The vice presidential nomination is the focus of manyconservatives who view it as a test of Bush's commitment to theiragenda.   Western Republicans want Bush to select one of their own _Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, Sens. James McClure of Idaho,Orrin Hatch of Utah or John McCain of Arizona, or Gov. GeorgeDeukmejian of California.   More intriguing are the lists drawn up by conservatives ofrunning mates who would be unacceptable to them _ people such asKean, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III or former Senate GOPleader Howard H. Baker Jr. Also high on such lists would beRepublican mavericks like Sens. Lowell Weicker Jr. of Connecticutand Bob Packwood of Oregon.   Leach, who thinks Howard Baker would be the ideal Bush runningmate, calls such demands ``the height of mischief.''   ``It's wrong,'' said Kean. ``The choice ought to be by the vicepresident.''   Party moderates don't expect to have the influence to outgun theconservatives on a matter like the vice presidential choice. Butthey harbor hopes of getting some of their views into the platform.   ``I have modest hopes but not great expectations,'' said Leach.   He cited education, the environment and arms control as areaswhere he would like to see changes from the very conservativeplatform adopted at the 1984 Republican convention.   Weicker plans to hold alternative platform hearings to hearviews on domestic issues, views that will have little chance ofturning up in the official party platform.   Kean said he disagreed with much of what was in the 1984platform, but ``to me the platform is not very important, it neverhas been. ... To me what's very, very important is not what theplatform says, but what the candidate says.''   Consultant Roger Stone, whose clients run the ideological rangefrom Kemp on the right to Kean on the left, said he would expect``a little fireworks over the platform'' but that Republicans``aren't that very far apart on issues any more.''   No longer, he said, does the party have a Goldwater wing and aRockefeller wing that waged bitter ideological battles two decadesago. The triumph of Reagan meant that for the immediate future, atleast, all the power is in the hands of the conservative wing.</TEXT></DOC>
