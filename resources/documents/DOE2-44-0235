In the UK,interest in wind generated energy is focused on large utility owned windturbine generators (WTGs). Operating experience on commercially producedand privately owned small grid-connected WTGs has been very limited.This study describes experience in the private sector with owning, runningand maintaining four WTGSs over the last 3-5 years. The economics ofowning the systems have been considered from the owners' point of view.The structure of electricity tariffs and direct utilisation of wind generatedelectricity override many other considerations including a high windregime location, higher buyback rates by the electricity authoritiesand better WTG performance. Local authority rates (property tax) area severe penalty for non-agricultural WTG owners.</TEXT></DOC>
