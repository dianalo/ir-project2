WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday pleaded forreconciliation and unity in this African country still recoveringfrom civil war and hostilities with Libya.   ``After the ordeals, the country is now on the road torenewal,'' the pontiff said. ``Chadians have chosen the path ofunity and peace. I hope this peace consolidates itself ... in aconstant search for forgiveness and reconciliation.''   The pope traveled to Chad from Burkina Faso on the final leg ofan eight-day, five-nation tour of the impoverished Sahel region.   Repression by the then-Christian government in 1965 againstMoslem populations in the center and north of Chad led to fightingthroughout the country which ceased only two years ago.   In August, Chad and Libya agreed to put an end to 16 years ofhostility and agreed to reach a political settlement over the45,000-square-mile Aouzou Strip that separates them.   Chad, however, says Libya continues to support rebel incursionsinto its territory from neighboring Sudan.   The pope did not mention the Libyan dispute in his speeches.   ``Your country has known much suffering, suffering due todrought and famine, suffering due to painful years of war,'' thepope said during a service at N'Djamena's Cathedral of Our Lady ofVictories.   ``Have confidence in life, have confidence in others, in orderto rebuild ... a better Chad, a reconciled Chad,'' he said.   The cathedral was gutted by mortar fire in 1980 during fightingbetween forces led by the current president, Hissene Habre, and hisLibyan-backed archrival Goukouni Oueddei, president from 1980 toJune 1982.   The arched-roof yellow cathedral was restored in 1986 and sitson an open field in the center of town, in front of a military camp.   ``I see this city reborn from ruins and discover tonight thatyour cathedral is bathed in youth and light,'' the pope said.   The pope was greeted at the airport by Habre, a 47-year-oldMoslem French-trained administrator and one-time guerrilla leader.A drum-and-bugle corps played the national anthem and ``MarchingThrough Georgia'' as a 21-gun salute was fired by French armoredvehicles.   In his airport speech, the pope offered his greetings to thecountry's Moslems.   ``I salute them and assure them that I come as a man of dialogueand messenger of peace,'' he said in French.   Chad has an estimated 5.5 million people, fewer than 400,000 ofwhom are Roman Catholics. Moslems account for about half of thepopulation.   The pope spends Wednesday in Chad before returning to Rome onThursday. He also has visited Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Mali.</TEXT></DOC>
