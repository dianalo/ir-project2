TraversStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RETAILING (RET)ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. retail sales dropped 0.6% in May, the Commerce Department said, suggesting some weakness in consumer buying power.    The decline centered in auto sales, which fell 3.8% last month after rising 0.8% in April. Excluding autos, May sales were up 0.3%. Total retail sales rose a revised 0.2% in April; originally, the rise was estimated at 0.1%. Without autos, April sales were unchanged from March.    &quot;This is evidence that consumer spending has slowed considerably,&quot; Sandra Shaber, vice president of Washington-based Futures Group, a consulting firm, said of the report. She said that rising prices are putting big-ticket items out of reach for many people.    &quot;Sales were rather weak,&quot; said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. He said the low savings rate and modest personal income gains of recent months are constraining spending. In addition, he said the sales figures would look even worse if price increases were taken into account.    The retail sales figures are adjusted for seasonal changes but not for inflation.    Sales of durables goods, which are items intended to last three years or more, fell 2.5% last month following a 0.1% increase in April. Home furnishings were down 0.8% following a 0.5% decline, while building materials rose 0.3% after falling 3.2% in April.    A bright spot in the report was a 0.6% rise in nondurable goods, following a 0.2% increase in April.    General merchandise sales rose 0.8% after a 0.5% gain in April. Rosalind Wells, chief economist at J.C. Penney Co., pointed to this rise as evidence that fears about drastic drops in consumer spending weren't justified. &quot;We expected the increase and also expect continued steady growth for nondurables,&quot; she said.    &quot;We had moderate growth in the area of general merchandise and that will help the overall rise in sales that I expect to see at the end of year,&quot; said Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner.    Among other nondurables, food-stores sales increased 0.3% after a rise of 0.2% in April. Gasoline station sales were up 0.8% after a 1.9% rise and apparel sales rose 1.3% after falling 2.7% in April.    The department's retail sales estimates are based on a relatively small sample of reports and frequently are revised substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays.    Overall, retail sales in May totaled $124.03 billion, down from $124.79 billion in April and 3.7% above a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
