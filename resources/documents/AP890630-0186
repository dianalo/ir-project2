Also Friday, fighting raged around a Karen guerrilla base nearthe Thai border in a government offensive that left at least 25Burmese troops and two rebels dead this week, Thai border policesaid.   As part of an intensified crackdown on dissent, authorities onTuesday and Wednesday arrested four student leaders and fourpoliticians, including a senior member of the National League forDemocracy.   ``The National League for Democracy has been systematicallycreating unrest,'' chief government spokesman, Kyaw Sann, told anews conference. He claimed League leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and TinOo have been urging people ``to defy the laws as a duty'' duringtheir political campaigning.   ``We warn them again that they will have to bear the consequencesof such irresponsible acts,'' the spokesman said.   The League on Friday attacked the recent arrests as``manifestation of political persecution'' by the military rulerswho seized control of power last September and brutally crushed astudent-led, pro-democracy uprising.   The government has allowed formation of opposition parties andpromised elections next year. But the League and other oppositiongroups have charged the government is creating a climate of fear andrepression that will make free elections impossible.   The Thai border police, speaking anonymously, said Friday'sfighting occurred around the Karen rebel camp of Pa Loo, whichBurmese troops attacked Tuesday, killing at least two rebels andwounding 14 others.   The attack left at least 25 troops dead and 35 others wounded,the police said.   Several thousand Burmese soldiers backed by heavy mortar andartillery fire began attacking Pa Loo and nearby Kaw Moo Ra in May.   The Karen rebels, with about 8,000 armed fighters, are thelargest of a dozen ethnic groups that have fought for four decadesfor greater autonomy in Burma.   Thai military sources said about 185 Burmese soldiers had beenkilled and and at least 470 wounded in attacks before June 15 on KawMoo Ra and Pa Loo. They reported only six Karens killed and 17wounded.   About 1,000 Karen civilians living near the battle zones havefled to Thailand since the fighting for the two bases began. Morethan 250 Thais have been forced to flee their homes in the villageof Ban Wang Kaew, across the border from Kaw Moo Ra.   Karen sources said this week that the Burmese had recentlystrengthened their assault force to 5,000 men. They had alsobolstered mortar positions in the hills to the west of the twocamps, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
