Police said seven people were killed.   In a separate conflict, two warring factions of the PalestineLiberation Organization called a cease-fire after battles thatkilled five people.   A Lebanese leader said Syrian troops would soon enter the slumsto quell the struggle between the Shiite militias _ theIranian-backed Hezbollah and pro-Syrian Amal. He also pledged in astatement to work toward releasing foreign hostages.   ``The doors of the suburbs are open for the Syrian army,''Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said in an interview with theconservative Beirut daily Al-Anwar that will appear Sunday. Anadvance copy was made available to The Associated Press.   ``No party in the suburbs intends to confront the Syrians,''Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide, was quoted as saying.   In a later statement, Fadlallah said he will ``invest all myenergies'' to resolve the hostage problem.   ``I am still working on exerting pressure to reach ahumanitarian solution to this problem,'' he said, withoutspecifying who he was exerting pressure on.   The statement was released through the Rev. Ray Barnett, head ofthe Seattle-based Friends in the West, a Christian human rightsgroup. Barnett said Saturday he established contact with Fadlallahin Beirut but declined to say how.   Police said seven people died and 45 were wounded in howitzerand mortar clashes Saturday between Hezbollah and Amal. At least260 people have been killed and 859 wounded since May 6 whenfighting broke out in the slums where most of the 18 Westernhostages, including nine Americans, are believed held.   The warren of narrow alleys and cement-block shanties is alongtime Shiite stronghold.   In the Palestinian conflict, police said rival guerrilla bandsobserved a cease-fire in the nearby refugee camps of Chatilla andBourj el-Barajneh after a night of clashes in which five peoplewere killed and 45 wounded.   The truce was reached after Yasser Arafat's Fatah, the main PLOfaction, dislodged Syrian-backed dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa'sFatah-Uprising from most of their positions in the camps.   Mousa's defeated followers sought refuge in Syrian-controlledterritory on the edges of the shantytowns, a police spokesman said.   Assem Kanso, leader of the Baath party, the Lebanese chapter ofSyria's ruling party, said the Syrians will move into south Beirutsoon, ``and, God willing, sooner than expected.''   He announced that orders to move into south Beirut might beissued in the next 24 hours. He said the Syrian deployment will be``peaceful so that there will be no more blood and destruction.''   Syria massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored vehiclesaround the slums after Hezbollah overran Amal positions to seizecontrol of 90 percent of the urban battleground.   Syria began threatening to move into the shantytown almostimmediately after the violence began.   The fighting persisted despite eight cease-fire accords brokeredby an Iranian mediator, acting Foreign Minister Ali MohammedBesharati.   Efforts to contain the fighting then shifted to the Syriancapital of Damascus, where Besharati delivered a message to SyrianPresident Hafez Assad from Iran's president, Ali Khamenei.   Syria's official media, reporting the Friday night meeting, didnot disclose the contents of the message.   In a related development, Kuwait's Al-Qabas newspaper, quotingan unnamed European foreign ministry report, said two of theShiites who hijacked a Kuwaiti jetliner last month died in thesouth Beirut fighting.   It said Qassem Zaineddin and Nihad Khashman, or his brotherFuad, were killed in a clash Monday night.   It said all three were involved in the April 5 hijacking, whichended when the Shiites surrendered in return for safe passage to anunidentified country. Two passengers were killed in the hijacking.   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's military intelligencein Lebanon, returned to Beirut on Saturday after consulting withmilitary commanders in Damascus on the crisis, a source at theSyrian command in Beirut said.   The Syrian Arab News Agency said that Vernon Walters, U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations, met with Assad in Damascus onSaturday and discussed ``the situation in the region.''   It gave no other details. But Walters, who arrived in DamascusFriday, had been expected to discuss Syrian efforts to free thehostages held in Beirut.   Syrian officers said the decision to move into south Beirut toquell the fighting had been delayed to give political efforts achance to arrange a settlement.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arabally in its war against Iraq, a longtime rival of the Syrians.   But Damascus has been alarmed by Iran's efforts throughHezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country'slargest single sect.</TEXT></DOC>
