What will it take to build that utopia where menunderstand how women want them to act, where women discernmen's messages and where corporations provide an environmentin which every employee can excel, regardless of gender?</LP><TEXT>   In the aftermath of the Clarence Thomas controversy, agrowing number of companies and their employees are askingjust those questions. They're bent on narrowing the gendergulf and reducing what Prof. Judy B. Rosener of theUniversity of California, Irvine, terms the &quot;sexual static&quot;that clouds the air between the sexes. Already, a number ofemployers, large and small, are trying fresh approaches toeliminate sexual stereotypes and favoritism.   First: What do men need to realize about their femalecolleagues? Here's some advice from women:   &quot;Don't assume that women are there to sleep their way tothe top or to find a husband. Don't assume that they enjoy&quot;off-color jokes and sexual advances, offers Jane A. Halpert,industrial psychologist at De Paul University, Chicago.   Be aware that a gesture that seems friendly to one personmay be threatening to another, adds Diane Korntheuer, managerof employee relations at Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. In onecase at Aetna, a manager in his 50s patted a younger employeeon the back in what he thought was a fatherly way, &quot;neverrealizing that it made her very uncomfortable,&quot; Ms.Korntheuer says. &quot;He had to cut that out, period.&quot;   Heed a woman's nonverbal signals or reports from herassociates that she is offended by an action if she doesn'tspeak up herself, advises Julie Wetteland, an executivesecretary at a telecommunications company. If he discovers hehas made someone uncomfortable, she says, the man &quot;should goback and say, `I understand our conversation made youuncomfortable the other day. Is that true? I want you to beopen and tell me that.'&quot;   What must women understand about men?   For one thing, men say, realize that many men are confusedabout today's sexual politics in the workplace. Then givethem a clear understanding of the new rules of the game. &quot;Theline between sexual harassment and courtship is as thin as arazor's edge,&quot; contends Warren Farrell, author of &quot;Why MenAre The Way They Are.&quot;   Further, women should realize that an increasing number ofmen feel a significant conflict between work and family life.&quot;Men are caught between today's different set of expectationsabout what it means to be a father, and yesterday'sworkplace,&quot; says James A. Levine, director of the FatherhoodProject at the Families and Work Institute in New York.   &quot;Men are moving toward sharing {family} responsibilities,but they are much more trapped by the corporate culture thanmany people believe,&quot; says Bradley Googins, head of BostonUniversity's Center on Work and Family. The rigidexpectations of men in the workplace &quot;are almostundiscussable {and are} more deeply embedded&quot; than somestereotypes about women, he adds.   What has to change to create the ideal workplace?   On the sexual harassment front, many companies areestablishing better review and disciplinary procedures.Beyond sexual harassment, many companies are working toeliminate gender bias in hiring, job scheduling, feedback andperformance evaluation. In terms of hiring, for instance,Gary Ames, president of U S West Inc.'s communications unit,rejected a list of four finalists for a vice president's spotbecause they were all white males. He demanded that theheadhunter supply a &quot;pluralistic&quot; roster including otherethnic groups and women. He wound up hiring two women.   At more companies, rigid and traditional work schedulesare changing to ensure that women -- who carry the bulk ofthe child- and elder-care load in the American family --aren't crippled in the job race. Roughly 10% of America'slarge companies have embraced flexible scheduling and a rangeof assistance programs to support workers juggling familydemands.   But flexible scheduling and child-care programs alonewon't level the playing field. Instead, a metamorphosis incorporate culture is needed, contends Fran Rodgers, presidentof Work/Family Directions, a Boston consultant -- and only afew U.S. companies have begun such a change in earnest.   Companies must change the way they evaluate workers'contributions, experts agree. &quot;Any time someone identified asa fast tracker has to prove him or herself by working longhours before the age of 35, you rule out women with youngchildren,&quot; Ms. Rodgers says.   U S West ties the performance evaluations and compensationof 125 officers and top managers to a sophisticated gauge oftheir commitment to pluralism. The managers' recruitment,hiring and promotion of women and minorities are measured aspart of the evaluation. Southern New England Telephone haskey managers sit down annually to assess the career paths ofpromotable employees and ensure that enough women andminorities are represented.   Companies also need to shift their emphasis to rewardingperformance, not just an employee's presence. That may meanincorporating new performance yardsticks, such as peer reviewin which employees offer feedback on the contribution ofother workers on their team.   Some companies are encouraging better communicationbetween the sexes. At Nynex Corp., a mentoring programenables several women to meet and discuss career issues witha manager two levels above them. This helps inform topmanagement about women's concerns as well as assisting women,says Joseph Anderson, director, managing diversity, forNynex.   Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. offers its accountants a two-daygender-awareness training program, and all 64,000 of U SWest's employees are being asked to take part indiversity-training workshops.   Bringing larger numbers of women into top management willspeed cultural change, experts say. But for many women, theideal workplace would go well beyond achieving greaterstatistical balance. It would tap some of women's specialstrengths, taking advantage of their perspective and skillsto make U.S. business more competitive. Many concerns alreadymine women's instincts and know-how in tapping consumermarkets for cars, cosmetics, books and other items.   But the potential of women goes far beyond their marketinsights. Women, for instance, are generally considered moreskilled than men in &quot;systemic thinking&quot;or sensing how forcesand factors interrelate -- while a more &quot;linear&quot; pattern ofthinking -- or focusing on forces and factors in isolation --is more commonly associated with men. Systemic thinking isincreasingly important in an environment that stressesteamwork and responding to international competition, expertssay.   In a workplace that consciously tapped these specialabilities, &quot;I would feel needed instead of accepted,&quot; saysFaith Wohl, director of work-force partnering for Du Pont Co.&quot;I think we've come a long way, we've been allowed in andmany of us feel we've been accepted. But acceptance is astage on the way to being vital.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
