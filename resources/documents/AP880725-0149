Meese told the National Press Club that if Deputy AttorneyGeneral Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld haddone their jobs correctly, there probably would have been no basisfor independent counsel James McKay to investigate Meese.   McKay recently concluded that Meese ``probably'' broke criminallaws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek anindictment. Meese has since announced he will resign, probably bymid-August, and has pronounced himself ``completely vindicated.''   Weld and Burns said they would have no immediate comment onMeese's attack. Both are scheduled to testify before Congress onTuesday.   Meese said the decision to launch a criminal investigation ofhim was based on ``hearsay'' from executives of the scandal-plaguedWedtech Corp. and who had pleaded guilty to felony charges. He saidthat neither he nor ``to the best of my knowledge'' his longtimefriend, E. Robert Wallach, who is under indictment for allegedracketeering in the Wedtech scandal, was interviewed during theinquiries overseen by Burns and Weld.   Burns and Weld abruptly resigned four months ago to protestMeese's continued tenure as attorney general in the face of McKay'sinvestigation. Burns and Weld are scheduled to testify about theirresignations Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Meese declared that ``the evidence now shows that if a competentand thorough preliminary investigation had been directed by thethen-deputy attorney general and the former head of the criminaldivision, there would likely have been no cause for referral to anindependent counsel.'' The attorney general did not refer to Burnsand Weld by name.   In the spring of 1987, Burns and Weld oversaw initial inquiriesby the Justice Department's public integrity section into Meese'sinvolvement with Wedtech. That resulted in an application to afederal court by Burns, with Weld's concurrence, for McKay tolaunch a full-scale criminal investigation of Meese on May 11,1987. At the time, Meese asked for the probe as well.   Federal law enforcement sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, say the integrity section found sufficient evidence towarrant further investigation of Meese for possible violations of alaw barring acceptance of gratuities. They also said furtherinvestigation was merited on whether Meese aided and abetted apossible violation of the conflict-of-interest law by former WhiteHouse aide-turned-Wedtech lobbyist Lyn Nofziger.   Had investigators spoken to him or to Wallach, ``the hearsay''from ``some criminals in New York ... would have been exposed forwhat it is'' and ``there would have been no need to even refer thisto the independent counsel,'' said Meese.   After Meese's speech, Justice Department spokesman PatrickKorten acknowledged that an FBI agent had interviewed Meese inApril 1987, but said that was in response to the Wedtech probebeing conducted in New York by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, notin connection with the internal Justice Department review ofMeese's activities.   According to the sources, Wallach, who is under indictment foralleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, also had beenquestioned extensively in the Giuliani probe.   Meese also questioned the motives of Burns and Weld forresigning. Burns told President Reagan after quitting that Meese'slegal problems had caused a ``malaise'' in Justice Departmentmorale.   Meese disputed suggestions of low morale, saying ``whether thesources of these falsehoods are the claims of partisan politicianson Capitol Hill or the self-serving statements of a few individualswho left the department for their own purposes, an objective lookwill reveal that such characterizations could not be farther fromthe truth.''   Meese also said that in regard to McKay's investigation, ``neverbefore has any independent counsel proceeding resulted in such aseries of leaks'' to the news media.   ``To be the subject of a relentless series of articles, based onleaks, which often turned out to be false or misleading, and to beseverely restricted in my ability to respond, generates a feelingof helplessness and frustration that is almost beyonddescription,'' said Meese.</TEXT></DOC>
