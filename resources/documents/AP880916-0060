DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless lowpressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf ofMexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind thatbaffles forecasters.   ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the rightplace in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National HurricaneCenter said Thursday. ``It doesn't happen very often. How itdevelops, we don't know.''   Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as adry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.   ``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one ofsix develop,'' said Clark.   By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropicalstorm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.   A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a namedtropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained windshit 74 mph.   Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systemsdidn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miamimeteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.   ``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he saidThursday. ``That's something meteorologists would like to know moreabout.''   But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm oncedevelopment begins. And they know that development is sparked whenwinds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.   ``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture inthe lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), thisconvergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Blecksaid.   ``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the cloudsoccasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergencepattern. That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms canbegin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.   Eventually, a vortex is created.   ``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, thosewinter storms,'' Bleck said.   Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine. Their primaryrole is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,''he said. ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of theoceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to bedistributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.''   When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.   ``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best fordevelopment,'' Clark said. ``If you get a storm in this area inSeptember, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This iswhere Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 stormthat slammed into the Gulf Coast.   ``It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beachwatching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said.   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inchesTuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricanethat devastated the Florida Keys.</TEXT></DOC>
