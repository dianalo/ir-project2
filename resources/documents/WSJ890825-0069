Bombs also destroyed the summer homes of two politicians there. Other bombs were defused at the offices of two radio networks in Medellin, the city that is home to Colombia's drug kingpins .    &quot;We declare total and absolute war on the government, on the industrial and political oligarchy, on the journalists who have attacked and ravaged us, on the judges that have sold out to the government, on the extraditing magistrates, on the presidents of the unions, and all those who persecuted and attacked us,&quot; said a communique left at one of the radio networks signed by &quot;The Extraditables,&quot; a name used by drug traffickers facing extradition to the U.S. The communique said, &quot;We will not respect the families of those who have not respected our families,&quot; and vowed to &quot;burn and destroy the industries, the properties and the mansions of the oligarchy.&quot;    A U.S. narcotics expert here told reporters that the Colombian cartels, which control about 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the U.S., felt &quot;cornered&quot; and most likely would continue to lash out in an effort to &quot;bend the will of the government.&quot;    At the University of Miami, Bruce Bagley, an expert on Colombia and the cocaine trade, said the nation's drug mafia sees itself as an emergent entrepreneurial class that, despite accumulating an enormous amount of wealth, has been rebuffed in its attempts to join the Colombian establishment. Its aim, he said, is to force the Colombian government into negotiating its legitimization. &quot;They want into the system -- not to take it over,&quot; said Mr. Bagley.    For its part, the government also seemed prepared to go to the mat. The assassination last week of Luis Carlos Galan, 45 years old, a presidential candidate who was favored to win his party's nomination and the next election, has forced a harder line and provoked a wave of public revulsion against the country's drug traffickers. Mr. Galan, who had made his career speaking strongly against drugs and drug-linked corruption, was a charismatic leader many hoped would renew the country's atrophied political system and perhaps lead it out of a miasma of cocaine, death squads and guerrillas.    &quot;It's the death of all illusions that still dare to grow in this rocky place that is Colombia today,&quot; wrote Daniel Samper, an influential Colombian newspaper columnist this week.    In the resulting crackdown, Colombian police and army units seized 142 small planes, 20 helicopters and 141 houses, offices, ranches and other property with a total value of more than $200 million allegedly belonging to drug traffickers. Yesterday, the government decreed that the assets would be given away unless owners could prove within five days they had acquired them with legally obtained funds. Authorities have detained about 11,000 people, including five men suspected of being Mr. Galan's assassins.    Also detained were an alleged cartel financial wizard, Eduardo Martinez Romero, and four other persons the Colombian government says are wanted in the U.S. on drug charges. But the cartel's top men have escaped capture and are thought to be in hiding either abroad or in the country's remote jungle regions.    Mr. Bagley believes that Colombia's war on drugs will have little impact on the flow of drugs into the U.S. Some shipments may be delayed, some routes changed, but the crackdown won't affect the demand for cocaine in the U.S. &quot;It's a balloon effect,&quot; said Mr. Bagley. &quot;Push on one side and a bulge will come out on the other.&quot;    Even if Colombia is able to capture and extradite the top men of the cartel, others would surely take their place, he said. A less powerful drug dealing organization, the Cali cartel, has been involved for the past year and a half in a bloody battle for supremacy with the &quot;capos&quot; -- the bosses -- of the Medellin group, Mr. Bagley says.    He says a crackdown in Colombia could lead to the vertical integration of the cocaine industries in other Andean countries. Peru and Bolivia, now the top growers of coca leaf and producers of coca paste, from which cocaine is refined, may now start producing the finished cocaine themselves. The bulk of refining currently is done in clandestine Colombian labs.    While the world trade in drugs will adjust to the Colombian crackdown, Colombia will still suffer most of the casualties. Most Colombians expect the impact to be more murders of judges, policemen, journalists and politicians. At least 220 judges and other officials have already been killed in recent years as the drug cartel attempted to intimidate Colombian society.    Colombian President Virgilio Barco reinstated by decree last Friday a treaty with the U.S. that allows for the extradition of drug traffickers. (A U.S. government plane has been at the Bogota airport since the weekend, reportedly ready to fly extradited drug traffickers to the U.S., officials in Washington told the Associated Press.) It is also by presidential decree that Mr. Barco ordered the confiscation of the properties of the alleged drug dealers. The legality of these measures will undoubtedly be challenged by lawyers working for the drug dealers.    As in the past, judges will be given the choice of &quot;plata o plomo,&quot; a bribe or a bullet, to rule favorably for the traffickers. One Bogota judge who handles delicate drug cases made his choice yesterday. Judge Alvaro Medina Moreno resigned, saying he had received numerous death threats against his 14-year-old daughter.    &quot;In legitimate defense of my daughter's life, my decision to quit is irrevocable,&quot; he told reporters. </TEXT></DOC>
