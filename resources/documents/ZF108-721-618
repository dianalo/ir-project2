(MacInTouch.)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>A discussion of common problems with mounting Apple Macintosh harddisks and debugging the PostScript language is presented.andO;'Mounting' a disk is the process of making a 'volume ' of filesavailable on the Finder's desktop and normally takes placeautomatically at start-up time.andP;  Magnetic and optical cartridgedevices present special problems because the operating systemneeds a separate driver for each device and the drivers will notload if no cartridge is present at start-up.andP;  Most vendors providea separate driver file for automatic loading, and some utilityprograms let users manually mount off-line volumes.andP;  The CheshireGroup's PinPoint 1.1 is an effective PostScript debugger thatsells for $49.95 and lets users easily troubleshoot documents thatfail to print because of PostScript errors.andP;  It also has aprotection feature that prevents the password on a printer's ROMchips from being changed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Cheshire Group (products).andO;Product:   PinPoint 1.1 (Program development software) (productintroduction).andO;Topic:     Debugging ToolsHard DiskUser AssistanceGuidelines.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mounting disk cartridges and debugging PostScriptandM;Bugs andamp; tipsandM;Mount 'em cowboy.andP;  The strange phrase &quot;to mount a disk&quot; came originally fromenvironments where an operator in a special computer room would take a disk(a stack of platters) out of its protective enclosure and physically place iton a spindle in a drive that looked like a washing machine.andM;In the modern Mac environment, with its sealed Winchester disks, &quot;mounting&quot;has come to mean something slightly different.andP;  It is the process of making a&quot;volume&quot; of Mac files available on the Finder's desktop.andM;Normally, a hard disk mounts automatically at start-up time, and that's that.andO;There are a few extra wrinkles, though, with magnetic and optical cartridgedrives.andM;The Mac operating system needs a separate &quot;driver&quot; to talk to each device.andO;Typically, the driver is loaded automatically from any hard disk that isconnected at start-up time.andP;  In the case of cartridge drives, however, thecartridge may not be in place at start-up, so no driver is loaded.andM;To get around this problem, vendors usually provide a separate driver filethat goes in the System folder of the start-up disk for automatic loading.andM;Some utility programs offer an alternative to putting drivers in your Systemfolder.andP;  The Control Panel device SCSI Probe (see MacWEEK, June 6, 1989)allows you to manually mount all off-line volumes by clicking on a button.andO;The mounting process loads drivers from disks or cartridges if necessary andalso remounts volumes that have been dragged off the desktop into the Trash.andO;Bill Steinberg's MountEm is an Fkey that performs the same functions.andM;One potential problem with cartridge drives is confusion among drivers: Ifyou start up with a cartridge in place from vendor X and eject it to insert acartridge from vendor Y, the Mac isn't smart enough to switch drivers.andP;  Theoperating system will use X's driver for everything in that drive, includingY's cartridges, until you restart the computer.andP;  This can wreak havoc, so useonly one vendor's cartridges per session.andM;SCSI Probe and MountEm are available in the Zmac download library (Section 3,file names MOUNTE.SIT and SCSIPR.SIT).andM;Redebugging.andP;  Not long after we wrote about Systems of Merritt Inc.'sAdvanced PostScript Error Handler (see MacWEEK, June 12), we got a copy ofanother PostScript debugger, PinPoint from the Cheshire Group.andP;  PinPoint's$49.95 price is much less than the $295 charged by Systems of Merritt.andM;Both products operate similarly.andP;  By downloading the program to a PostScriptprinter, any job that fails to print will generate a report listing the errortype and interpreter's status when the error occurred.andM;There are some differences that make the price gap understandable.andP;  TheAdvanced PostScript Error Handler is a technical tool for PostScriptprogrammers.andP;  It has more-thorough documentation and prints more-detailedreports.andM;PinPoint is most useful as a support and troubleshooting tool for users whohave documents that will not print because of a PostScript error.andP;  It can beused to fix simple errors or to provide application vendors with informationabout the cause of a print failure.andM;Version 1.1 of PinPoint contains one feature not found in the AdvancedPostScript Error Handler: virus control.andP;  Reports have circulated of aPostScript program containing a Trojan horse that changes the internalpassword found in the EEROMs (electrically erasable ROMs) of a PostScriptdevice (see MacWEEK, July 31).andP;  Without the right password, the printer willnot operate properly, and the only solution is to replace the chips.andO;PinPoint's protection feature prohibits any changes to the password.andM;REFERENCEandM;Cheshire Group, 601 Van Ness Ave., Suite E3259, San Francisco, Calif.andP;
