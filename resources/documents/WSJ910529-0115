Say further that the people who told you that timeand money were no object also said they would demand a fullaccounting for any failure to get the job done.

He willkeep on trying to please Congress by pinning serious crime onsomeone.</LP><TEXT>   The Justices saw no reason to second-guess the conclusionof the federal appeals court in Washington that the caseagainst Oliver North collapsed. The appeals court reversedthe convictions because Independent Counsel Walsh violatedMr. North's right to a fair trial. To gain Mr. North's publictestimony, Congress forced him to drop his Fifth Amendmentrights and guaranteed he would be immune from prosecutionbased on that testimony; but then it sicked IndependentCounsel Walsh to prosecute him without proving the evidencewas untainted by the coerced congressional testimony.   Predictably, Mr. Walsh said yesterday that he would keeptrying; what's another few million dollars to the tens ofmillions he's spent so far? Under the appeals-court rulingthat the Supreme Court upheld, Mr. Walsh would have to provethat no witness, prosecutor or jury was tainted by Mr.North's testimony. The appellate judges said that if Mr.Walsh ever tried again, there must be a hearing to &quot;inquireinto the content as well as the sources of the grand jury andtrial witnesses' testimony.&quot; This inquiry &quot;must proceedwitness-by-witness; if necessary, it will proceedline-by-line and item-by-item.&quot;   Mr. Walsh is ignoring broad hints to pack it in. Theappeals court wrote that &quot;we readily understand how court andcounsel might sigh prior to such an undertaking&quot; because anysuch hearings &quot;could consume substantial amounts of time,personnel and money, only to lead to the conclusion that adefendant&quot; cannot get a fair trial. This is especially truebecause at least two witnesses in the congressional hearingroom, Robert McFarlane and Rep. Lee Hamilton, later testifiedin Mr. North's criminal trial.   The hyper-partisan liberals who still egg on Mr. Walshclaim that the Iran-Contra affair was somehow about &quot;crimes.&quot;Our view from the beginning has been that the key issue isseparation of powers. From the Boland amendments to demandsthat the Walsh prosecution team go to the ends of the earthfor a scalp, Congress and Mr. Walsh have been on the wrongside of the Constitution. As Judges Laurence Silberman andDavid Sentelle wrote in reversing Mr. North's convictions,&quot;We do not countenance political trials in this country, andthis matter is not styled Independent Counsel v. ExecutiveBranch or even Congress v. Executive Branch.&quot;   Mr. Walsh has publicly dismissed or even denouncedcriticism of his performance here and elsewhere. We note thatback in 1988 we, along with the ACLU, predicted that anyconvictions of Mr. North would be reversed on appeal becauseof this problem with immunized testimony.   We will wager another prediction. It is that whileCongress will never find any prosecutorial abuse in this caseunacceptable, at some point before the year 2000 enoughjudges will send enough signals to Mr. Walsh that hisobsession has gone far enough, and he will finally pack uphis shingle and call it a day.</TEXT></DOC>
