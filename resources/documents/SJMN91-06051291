He said he was even approached while outshopping by people who wanted to buy the small cloth flag sticker he waswearing.;    &quot;I've never sold 1,000 of these (cloth flag stickers) in mylife,&quot; he said. Now the 10,000 he bought are almost gone.;    &quot;The day of thewar, people called me looking for American flags. The second day we just gotbombarded. People wanted anything with flags on it,&quot; said Jarrett's son,Phillip, who helps him run the business.;    An attempt to order additionalsmall cloth flags the day after the war proved fruitless, Phil Jarrett said.His distributor was already back-ordered for a half a million.;    The floodof calls has even prompted the Jarretts, who generally work as wholesalers anddistributors, to sell retail.;    People can buy Desert Storm buttons,mini-cloth flags, eagle patches and both paper and cloth flag stickers fromButton King's office on Old Oakland Road. In addition, Button King willmanufacture custom-designed buttons and can customize hundreds of other items,including yo-yos, cheese trays, mugs and ball point pens.;    In the back ofthe 10,000-square-foot office, the air is filled with the sound of&quot;shush-clink-shush-clink&quot; coming from the room that houses the company's eightautomatic button-makers.;    All around, workers are rushing to fill the day'sorders. Button King can manufacture as many as 40,000 buttons a day.;    Oneorder is from the staff at a local hospital, which found out one of itsdoctors is going to be deployed to the Middle East. The staff plans to wearbuttons that say: &quot;Dan's our man in the Persian Gulf.&quot;;    Debra Conway, fromPacifica, is one of the many customers who have been coming into the ButtonKing office. Conway, who works for United Airlines, had driven to the San Joseshop to pick up 150 red, white and blue &quot;I Support Desert Storm&quot; buttons.;   &quot;Everyone wants them. I'll take these to work and they'll go so fast,&quot; shesaid.;    Conway -- who carries a small paper American flag with pictures ofher two brothers, participants in Desert Storm, laminated on the back of it --will sell the buttons to co-workers.;    &quot;I don't do it for the money. I sellthem at the same price I buy them. I just want everyone to have them,&quot; shesaid. &quot;It's great, though. You walk around United and everyone's got flagson.&quot;;    Turnaround time on buttons is generally six days, John Jarrett said,but the company can manufacture buttons in eight hours for an additional fee.Jarrett said there is no minimum order on the number of buttons, in fact, somefolks have been known to come in and order a single button.;    IF YOU'REINTERESTED; The Button King is located at 2355 Old Oakland Road.
