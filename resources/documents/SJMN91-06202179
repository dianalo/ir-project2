Fencing with disadvantaged kids?What's your problem?';    &quot;I said 'Look at myself, I'm a proven product thatit works. Look at (two-time Olympian) Mike Lofton. He's a proven product thatit works. If it can happen to us, why can't we give it back to them?' &quot;;   Westbrook, a four-time Olympian, welcomed 10 youngsters to the New YorkFencers Club on the first day of the Peter Westbrook Foundation back in March.It quickly swelled to 43 and stayed in that range for the full 10 weeks.;   Even he was somewhat surprised.;    &quot;Fencing is not a popular sport in ourcountry, never mind in the inner-city, those kinds of communities,&quot; Westbrooksaid. &quot;It's an elite, European white sport.&quot;;    Westbrook, 39, got involvedin fencing at the suggestion of his mother when he was about 14. He hadformerly competed in track and boxing, but liked fencing right away when hetook it up at Essex Catholic High School.;    His talent earned him ascholarship to New York University, where he majored in marketing andeconomics. He has gone on to earn a berth on the Olympic team every year since1976, winning a bronze medal in 1984.;    The reason for his success? Naturalability is part of it, but he also figures some of it had to do withintangibles.;    &quot;I have a theory that if you get your kids in about 10 or 15things, hopefully he'll just find the right niche and gravitate to that,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Luckily, I only tried a few things, and I happened to be pushed in theright area for some reason.&quot;;    When he formed his foundation, Westbrooksought the help of heavyweights inside and outside of athletics. Among thoseon his board of directors are Arthur Ashe, Wilma Rudolph and the president ofNYU.;    When the first program concluded, Westbrook bought trophies for everyparticipant. When the kids received their trophies, they also had to say a fewwords -- in front of their parents and the other children -- about what theprogram has meant to them.;    &quot;I use fencing as a vehicle to teach aboutlearning how to win and how to lose in life, stress management, dealing withyour anger, dealing with all those kinds of obstacles we go through in life,&quot;Westbrook said. &quot;We're trying to give that to the kids.&quot;;    The next 10-weeksession of his program will be held in October. He also plans to team withAshe in a camp where youngsters will be able to learn fencing or tennis.;   In the meantime, he'll continue working toward a shot at the 1992 Olympics.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910720  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  520  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 20, 199100202179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
