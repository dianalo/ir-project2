Hartman, program manager for switched systems at the Army'sInformation Systems Management Activity office, Fort Monmouth, N.J., saidusers are so eager for micros that &quot;a large pent-up demand&quot; for desktopcomputing power surfaced quickly after the Desktop II contract with ZenithData Systems Corp. expired.andM;Hartman said his office hears regularly from Army officials at all levelsthat more computers are needed.andM;&quot;Desktop III was promised to be in place before Desktop II expired, but we'vegot a gap right now,&quot; Hartman said before the Desktop III award.andP;  &quot;The needfor PCs has not gone away, but the vehicle to get them easily has.&quot;andM;Desktop II, the three-year military requirements contract under which mostDefense Department micros were obtained, brought 398,000 Zenith Z-248 microsinto the government before the contract expired in February.andM;The Air Force bought the Z-248s through its Computer Acquisitions Center(AFCAC) at Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass.andP;  The service shifted the Desktop IIIprocurement to the Standard Systems Center, Gunter Air Force Base, Ala.,andO;where it experienced delays before its recent award.andM;Officials have said that the new Desktop III buy could be worth as much as$1.5 billion for a new generation of micros.andM;Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Bill Jaissle of the Army's Joint Service Computer Program said theArmy has fielded 136,649 Z-248s and 22,887 Z-184 laptops, which came fromanother Air Force-driven contract.andP;  Hartman said most are used asstand-alones.andM;Desktop II allowed the service to acquire Z-248s at a 30 percent to 50percent savings over a GSA schedule buy, Jaissle said.andP;  The Army spent $86million on micros in the last year, he said.andM;Acceptance of automation came slowly in some cases, officials said, butrecent advances in computer understanding can be measured in more requestsfor hardware.andM;&quot;The knowledge base of our users is increasing significantly,&quot; Hartman said.andO;&quot;We've got a much more sophisticated base of [micro] users out there than wedid a few years ago.&quot;andM;Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Richard Frazier, product manager for the Army's small computerprogram, said that where the Army has placed Z-248s, savings in man-yearshave been abundant.andP;  Frzier said that processing time for one parts-orderingtask in an Army unit in Europe was reduced from a week of manual work to anhour on the Z-248.andM;&quot;By putting one $3,000 Z-248 in place we saved seven man-years of effort,&quot; hesaid.andP;  This came to about $130,000 per year, and the procedure was adopted byother units as quickly as they could get the micros.andM;Hartman said such cost-savings fostered an evolutionary process.andP;  &quot;Peoplewatch or learn from another unit or another organization,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Theysee the 248 taking care of a function and they try to migrate it over totheir unit.&quot;andM;The recent demand for micros, Hartman said, also can be attributed to theincreased frequency of electronic mail use and users in the service.andP;  &quot;If youdon't have a terminal, you have a problem.andP;  You can't get your mail,&quot; hesaid.andM;Jaissle said the Army has increased its reliance on E-mail for time-sensitivemessages.andM;Frazier and Jaissle said the advent of off-the-shelf software for officeautomation, desktop publishing, graphics, briefing presentations and otherfunctions has compounded the demand for computing power.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
