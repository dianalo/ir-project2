(Network Management) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Roynan, James P.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>There is no doubt that the current trend towards standards andopen systems is an improvement over the days of proprietarysystems, but the industry must be careful to weigh user needs andexisting de facto standards as important in the overall equation.andO;One good example of this is the competition between the SimpleNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Common ManagementInformation Protocol (CMIP).andP;  SNMP has been established inparallel with TCP/IP standards for several years now and does anexcellent job of linking disparate networks.andP;  CMIP is the productof a standards organization and it is as yet unproven.andP;  It wouldmake much more sense to modify and extend SNMP with new features,rather than adopt a new standard that is merely recreating a defacto standard.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     StandardizationMethodsProtocolSimple Network Management ProtocolUser NeedsNetworksCritique.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If user-defined standards are to be at all sucessful, they must address thecurrent implementations of products and de facto standards that exist .andP;  .  .andM;As a kid, I used to play aports all the time, both organized and sandlot.andO;Whatever the season, whatever the weather, we could always find enoughneighborhood kids to play the games.andP;  Football and basketball in the fall andwinter, baseball in the spring and summer.andP;  Street hockey, tennis, and evengolf were squeezed in as we got older.andM;Seven days a week, morning until well into night, we would always be playingand competing.andM;Out of these competitive activities grew many rivalries.andP;  Rivalries betweenthe better athletes, rivalries between neighborhoods, and rivalries betweenschools.andP;  At times, the competitiveness that these rivalries engendered gotin the way of the purpose of playing the games.andP;  Arguments would break outover who knew what rules, whose idea for running a play was best, or whowould play quarterback.andM;Many times, games would break up over these arguments.andP;  By the timedifferences were patched up so that the games could resume, something elsewould get in the way, like dinner, homework or nightfall.andP;  The games wouldhave to be put off for another day.andM;For many years, the computer industry resembled my old neighborhood.andO;Computer companies were constantly trying to upstage one another with bettercomputers, faster processors, newer equipment, etc.andP;  Each one had a betteridea as to what a computer should be.andP;  The rivalries that grew among OEMsprevented them from determining the best solution for the customer.andP;  None ofthem had any desire to develop products that would complement products fromtheir competitors.andP;  They all wanted to be quarterbacks.andM;Then along came the &quot;open systems&quot; movement.andP;  Open systems was the refereethat would eliminate the arguments and set down the rules by which the gamewould be played.andP;  No more arguing, no more rivalries.andP;  Standardsorganizations would define the rules, users would define the playing fieldand the financial penalties for infractions, and OEMs would provide theproducts and services.andP;  The games would be fun again.andM;RIVALRIESandM;But the open systems movement has proven to be less than complete in itsquest to eliminate the rivalries within the computer industry.andP;  The desire toenact standards by which everyone can benefit has merely shifted the problemto those who were supposed to be the solution.andM;Now that users have been granted the &quot;privilege&quot; of defining what they wantfor and from their information systems, and now that OEMs realize that tocontinue producing proprietary products is tantamount to a personal foul andejection from the game, the focus has been shifted to standardsorganizations.andM;Take, for instance, the current debate over Simple Network ManagementProtocol (SNMP) versus Common Management Information Protocol (SMIP).andP;  Thecontroversy over which is the better network management protocol has itsroots in the TCP/IP versus OSI debate.andP;  SNMP grew up with TCP/IP technologythroughout the '70s and '80s, linking heterogeneous computer systems to oneanother through common interfaces.andP;  As the Internet network evolved, itsusers changed the interfaces and support systems to meet new technologies andnew requirements.andP;  No fanfare, no blaring horns, no parades.andP;  They just madethe adjustments and moved on.andM;CMIP is the &quot;standards-by-committee approach.&quot;andP;  All players get to proposetheir favorite plays, and the committee decides which pieces of theindividual plays are best.andP;  Then the committee attempts to call a play thatcontains elements of all the proposed plays.andP;  So CMIP is equivalent tocalling an end-run, where the linemen are pass-blocking and the quarterbackis rolling out looking for the bomb, while the receivers are running crossingpatterns.andP;  Everybody is happy because their play was part of the call -- butthe result is a loss of yardage.andM;If user-defined standards are to be at all successful, they must address thecurrent implementations of products and de facto standards that exist, aswell as reflect future industry trends.andP;  The desire to recreate technology,without regard for that which already exists, has led to the tensions thatexist not only between network protocol and network management camps, butbetween operating systems definers, standards organizations, and even, tosome degree, user organizations.andM;Protocols like TCP/IP and SNMP are very good at their respective jobs.andO;Although they lack the functionality that is ultimately desired by bothTCP/IP and non-TCP/IP users, there is a solid, proven methodology that shouldbe improved upon rather than scuttled in favor of an untested &quot;standard.&quot;andO;Why not include the newer functionality in the existing systems and productsrather than redefine the whole technology?andP;  Because that would be to admitthat someone has a better idea than you do.andM;As users, we have come a long way toward defining standards to the OEMs thatallow us to make information systems decisions based on price andperformance, rather than on what will work with our current products.andP;  Nowit's time to turn our attention to the organizations proposing the nextgeneration of standards for interoperability.andM;As we head into the 90's, the network will replace the mainframe as thecentral information systems focus.andP;  To make these networks effective, we mustbe able to introduce products and technologies without disruption to ourexisting users.andP;  Redefining standards in place of existing technologies isnot the best approach.andP;  Enhancing current technology, providing migrationpaths to those enhancements, and replacing technology only when no othercurrent implementation is adequate will ensure that the standards will beacceptable to everyone.andM;It's third and long in a close game, time is running out, and the ball isdeep in our own territory.andP;  What play will be called?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
