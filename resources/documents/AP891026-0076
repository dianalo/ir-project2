The new work, which used data gathered from ships and buoys, isat odds with an analysis of satellite data published in April.   A major reason for the difference was that airborne particlesfrom a Mexican volcano skewed satellite readings during 1982 and1983, making water temperatures appear cooler than they reallywere, researchers said.   Scientists are interested in ocean temperatures because they mayreflect the greenhouse effect, a predicted global warming due tobuildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.   The 1982-88 period itself, however, is too brief to draw anyconclusions about the greenhouse effect, researchers said.   The new study, by Richard Reynolds, research oceanographer atthe federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, D.C., and twoBritish scientists appears in today's issue of the British journalNature.   They took issue with a study by A.E. Strong, a researchoceanographer with the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration and a visiting scientist at the U.S. Naval Academyin Annapolis, Md.   In April, Strong reported that satellite observations show theworld's oceans and seas were warming at the surface by aboutone-fifth of a degree Fahrenheit a year between January 1982 andmid-1988.   The new work considered some satellite data as well as readingsfrom ships and buoys. Reynolds, in a telephone interview, said thevolcanic particles were the main problem with the original study.   He also said calculating a temperature trend over the analyzedperiod is difficult because the period is brief, and because itincluded two unusual warmings of the eastern equatorial PacificOcean, events called El Ninos.   Strong, who wrote the April paper, said Wednesday he is workingwith the other researchers to study the discrepancies.   He said that when satellite readings affected by the volcanicparticles were replaced with data from ships and buoys, thestrength of the overall calculated warming trend decreased by about30 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
