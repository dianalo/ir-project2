Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last three ormore years, amounted to a seasonally adjusted $114.3 billion lastmonth, the Commerce Department said.   That was a tiny $53 million rise and followed a slight 0.1percent increase in February and a sharp 1.2 percent drop inJanuary.   While economists had been expecting a substantial increase inMarch orders, the February number represented a sharp upwardrevision from a previous estimate of a 1.1 percent drop.   The report came as interest rates in bond market continued torise amid concerns that inflation is heating up again.   The yield of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond roseto 9.03 percent by late Thursday from 9.00 percent in the previoussession. The bond's yield rises when its price falls.   Analysts also said the bond market took a dim view of thegovernment's report that it ran up a $29.1 billion budget deficitin March, up from a $23.9 billion shortfall in February.   David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services inChicago, said the market had expected the deficit to decline by $4billion to $5 billion in March instead of rising.   Big deficits mean heavy government borrowing, which tends topush interest rates _ the cost of borrowing _ higher as competitionfor funds increases.   Oil futures prices, one indicator of potential inflation trends,moved higher Thursday after a two-day retreat. Contracts for Junedelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,closed up 38 cents at $18.36 per barrel on the New York MercantileExchange.   Analysts said the credit markets showed no reaction to theFederal Reserve's report that its three measures of the nation'smoney supply rose in early April.   On Wall Street, a sharp afternoon selloff wiped out early gainsto leave the stock market little changed from Wednesday's close.The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up by more than 30points at mid-session but finished the day up just 1.99 at 1,987.40.</TEXT></DOC>
