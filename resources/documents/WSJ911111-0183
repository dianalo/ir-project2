Can you name the domestic model?   Those who picked the Ford, go to the back of the class.</LP><TEXT>   The correct answer: They are all imports. But they alsoare all domestic models. It just depends on which U.S.government agency does the classifying.   Confused? This is just the beginning.   Consider the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Geo Prizm. Thesecars are virtually indistinguishable, even at close range.They're built on the same assembly line in Fremont, Calif.But to get maximum advantage under U.S. fuel economy laws,General Motors Corp. calls its Prizm a domestic model, whileToyota calls the Corolla an import. When it comes to the&quot;voluntary&quot; limit on imported Toyotas, however, theCalifornia Corollas suddenly become all-American. As&quot;domestic&quot; cars, they don't count against Toyota's quota.   If this all sounds absurd, that's because it is.   U.S. laws governing automotive trade and fuel economy arethe regulatory equivalent of a Model T. Washington bases keyelements of the laws designed to promote fuel-efficient cars,protect American jobs and boost sales of U.S.-made vehicleson distinctions between &quot;domestic&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; models.   But these distinctions are fast becoming anachronistic asauto makers spread their operations around the globe.Regulators simply can't keep up with the pace of change. U.S.and Japanese trade negotiators recently called a time-out intheir talks because they couldn't agree on a definition ofwhat a &quot;domestic&quot; American car is for tariff purposes.&quot;Nobody knows what anyone is talking about,&quot; despairsCommerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.   Some pundits say the answer is to scrap the old apparatus.&quot;What America should be worrying about is the value thatAmericans add to global products of whatever putativenationality,&quot; says Robert B. Reich, a professor at HarvardUniversity's Kennedy School of Government. Squabbling overthe nationality of products, he says, is &quot;an exercise notunlike medieval scholastics, where people worried about howmany angels could fit on the head of a pin.&quot;   But auto executives have their own solution: &quot;gaming,&quot; ormanipulating the government's outdated rules for maximumprofit. And as auto makers weave around the wheezingregulatory machinery, government policies for theenvironment, energy, federal deficit and American workers aresubverted.   For example, some 400 U.S. workers lost their jobs whenFord Motor Co. switched to foreign suppliers for a dozen orso parts for its big, V-8-powered Crown Victoria. But nowthat the car's seats, fuel tanks and windshield glass arebeing made in Mexico, Ford can call the Crown Victoria an&quot;import.&quot; That means the car's low fuel mileage will beaveraged with that of the fuel-stingy Festiva, which Fordbuys from Korean auto maker Kia Motors Corp. Ford alsoforestalls paying penalties for falling short of the U.S.&quot;domestic&quot; car fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles pergallon.   Ford officials say moving the Crown Victoria into theimport fleet allows the company to keep selling it, and thusavoid even more job losses. &quot;We're being permitted to takeadvantage of uncoordinated rules,&quot; says Susan Shackson, Forddirector of government policy.   Such bureaucratic gymnastics can yield huge savings forcar companies and consumers. Playing regulators against eachother has helped auto makers offer the large, less fuelefficient cars many Americans like -- while ducking federalfinancial penalties imposed on car fleets that exceed mileagestandards. Deft maneuverings also have enabled auto companiesto duck import taxes on Japanese-built utility vehicles andCanadian cars.   Such regulatory ruses have far-reaching effects. The flowof vehicles and parts across the U.S. border has turned intoa flood, nearly tripling in the last decade to $124 billionin 1990.   What's more, billions of dollars in auto industryinvestment turn on how government regulators see the world.   Consider the congressional debate on whether to force theauto industry to raise sharply the fuel efficiency of itscars.   In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Congress has weighed anumber of proposals to wean the U.S. economy off importedoil. One plan would require auto makers to redesign cars tolift their average fuel efficiency by nearly 25% to 34 milesa gallon in 2001 from the current standard of 27.5. Anotherwould raise the standard to 40 miles a gallon.   The original Corporate Average Fuel Economy law, known asCAFE (pronounced like the French word for coffee), wasenacted between oil shocks in 1975. It called for auto makersto raise the average mileage of their cars to 18 miles agallon by 1978, and to 27.5 by 1985.   Fearing huge job losses if U.S. auto makers tried to meetthe goals by importing high-mileage small cars from Japan,the powerful United Auto Workers union pressured Congress toforbid companies to average the fuel economies of theirimported cars with their domestically produced vehicles. Thuswas born the &quot;dual fleet&quot; system, which allows manufacturersto classify as domestically produced only the cars that haveat least 75% of so-called domestic content.   But, instead of preserving U.S. jobs, the dual fleetsystem is encouraging the Big Three to move jobs connected tobig-car production offshore. Japanese auto makers, meanwhile,say they're discouraged from employing more Americans andbuying more American parts.   Consider Nissan Motor Corp.'s Sentra subcompact. Nissansays the vehicle has domestic content of nearly 75% -- alevel that would make it a domestic model. Last week the automaker said it will raise the amount it spends on parts madeby U.S. suppliers by 40% to $3.3 billion. But that doesn'tmean the Sentra will soon become a &quot;domestic&quot; car. That'sbecause Nissan needs the Sentra, which gets up to 39 miles agallon, in its foreign fleet to offset its lower-mileageInfiniti Q45.   &quot;To make the Sentra a domestic vehicle would be akin toshooting ourselves in the foot,&quot; says Timothy MacCarthy,Nissan's director of government affairs. That means it'sunlikely Nissan will bring more Sentra jobs to the U.S., hesays. &quot;It would be foolish for us to do any more.&quot;   Nissan's not alone. Seven Japanese companies built some1.3 million cars and trucks in the U.S. last year. Every oneof them was considered an import for CAFE purposes, and everyone was considered domestic for the purposes of the importrestraints.   Meanwhile, the purpose for which CAFE was created -- toget auto makers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles -- isbeing defeated. The combined fuel economy for cars, vans andlight trucks sold in the U.S. is lower now than just threeyears ago, and the nation uses as much foreign oil now as itdid in 1975.   &quot;The things happening now were not imagined by the peoplewho wrote the CAFE law,&quot; says Donald Bischoff, a NationalHighway Traffic Administration official.   CAFE rules often work at cross-purposes with trade policy.Under the U.S.-Canada Free Trade agreement, for example, carsmust be at least 50% U.S.-content to avoid paying duties atthe Canadian border.   But what qualifies as &quot;domestic content&quot; under the fueleconomy rules, administered by the Transportation Department,may not qualify as domestic under the trade agreement, whichis enforced by the Customs Service.   The Transportation Department says marketing expenses canbe included as domestic content for fuel-economy purposes.Customs excludes such costs, defining domestic content mainlyby the origin of a car's parts.   Confusion over the conflicting definitions recently causedthe Treasury Department to delay a decision on whether HondaCivic hatchbacks assembled in Alliston, Ont., should betreated as North American cars or cars imported from Japan.Originally set to release their decision early this month,Treasury officials now say they need longer to sort throughthe situation. At stake is $20 million in tariffs that Hondacould be forced to pay if Treasury officials decide the carsdon't meet the content requirements.   GM and Suzuki Motor Corp. are wrestling with Customsofficials over a similar issue. The car makers want to treatdepreciation on equipment at their Ingersoll, Ont., jointventure plant as domestic content for the two trucks producedthere, the Chevrolet Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick. In apreliminary ruling the Customs Service has said no. At stakeis a 25% tariff on each vehicle unless the two auto makersprevail.   Auto executives fume that the left hand of the U.S.bureaucracy doesn't know what the right is doing. Indeed, asU.S. officials push policies that could increase the price ofa GM product (the Tracker), other officials are helping Hondasell more cars overseas.   Honda wants to export some of its U.S.-built cars toEurope as American cars. As such, they would avoid Europeanimport quotas on Japanese cars. When French officials triedto exclude the Ohio-made Hondas as Japanese, U.S. governmentofficials intervened.   &quot;We stated to the world, to anyone who would listen, thatthey are North American cars,&quot; says Timothy O'Leary, aspokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Askedif the Trade Representative had stated the same to the U.S.Department of Transportation, which considers Ohio-madeHondas foreign cars, an official says the TransportationDepartment's system has nothing to do with tradeclassifications.   In fact, automotive trade laws have loopholes so big someauto makers are able to drive thousands of trucks throughthem.   In an effort to protect domestic truck makers, the U.S.levies a 25% tariff on imported light trucks. But someJeep-like &quot;sport utility vehicles,&quot; those with four doors,pay the lower, 2.5% tariff for cars even though they'remarketed as trucks. Toyota, for example, pays a 2.5% duty onfour-door versions of its 4-Runner off-road vehicle, which itsells as a truck.   Big Three officials complain that foreign truck makers arecosting the U.S. Treasury $500 million a year by callingtheir four-door sport vehicles cars. Detroit lost a fight in1989 to have these vehicles reclassified. Apparentlyundaunted, the Big Three are continuing their battle to getthe laws changed to a more favorable position for them.Democratic Rep. Dale Kildee, whose Flint, Mich., district hasa high concentration of GM employees, is pushing a bill thatwould force auto makers that classify vehicles as trucks forone purpose to classify them as trucks for all otherregulatory purposes.   But as Mr. Kildee's bill languishes under congressionalskirmishing, the prize for the most creative use of theconflicting rules probably goes to Britain's Rover GroupLtd., maker of the Range Rover sport-utility vehicle.   The British-made Range Rover lists for more than $40,000.But buyers don't pay the 10% luxury tax on the amount above$30,000. That's because Rover officials got the InternalRevenue Service to put their product in the same class of&quot;multi-purpose vehicles&quot; as a Winnebago camper, exempt fromthe luxury tax.   For fuel-economy purposes, the Range Rover is a truck.Buyers must pay a $120-per-vehicle gas-guzzler penalty, butthey would pay even more if the Transportation Departmentcalled the Range Rover a car.   So does the Range Rover pay the Customs Service that 25%tariff levied on imported trucks? No. It has four doors, andthus Customs calls it a car.   Range Rover spokesman William Baker says the company isn'tbeing devious. &quot;In our case,&quot; he says, &quot;the vehicle doesn'tfit neatly into one category or the other.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
