Most analysts, however, expect year-to-year gains to continue tapering off, with actual declines appearing by mid-1989.    In the quarter ended Sept. 30, a Wall Street Journal survey finds, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 490 major corporations rose 14% from the 1987 third quarter, when profits were very strong. Net income climbed 12%.    The modest gain compares with a 101% surge in this year's second quarter. The spectacular April-June showing was ascribed mostly to major banks' rebound from huge losses in the 1987 second quarter, when they substantially raised foreign-debt reserves. Excluding the banks, net income in this year's second period rose 22% from a year earlier. That was down from 24% in the first quarter and from 51% in last year's fourth period.    So, a profit slowdown seems under way, and some economists had expected it to move faster than it has. But except for the weak earnings at some Wall Street securities firms, last fall's stock-market crash has inflicted little damage on corporate earnings. &quot;So far,&quot; says Melissa Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, corporate profits &quot;have come in better than the Street expected.&quot;    Several factors are helping bolster profits. Most important is the business expansion, which enters its seventh year next month. In addition, Christopher Caton, an economist at the consulting firm of Data Resources Inc., says &quot;wages and salaries, a cost to corporations, are clearly growing less rapidly than previously expected.&quot;    Jason Benderly, a vice president at the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., comments that &quot;reported profits this year are benefiting from higher inventory profits&quot; as stepped-up inflation raises the value of existing stocks. He also says some effects of the 1986 tax law that held down 1987 after-tax profits -- mainly regarding depreciation allowances -- are affecting year-to-year comparisons less sharply this year.    Looking ahead, Mr. Caton predicts that profits will &quot;erode in 1989 and 1990, as real growth weakens and corporate interest payments, in particular, pick up.&quot;    Among strong groups in the just-ended quarter were airlines, autos, forest products and steel. Oil companies generally benefited from huge profits in refining, marketing and petrochemicals. In metals, aluminum producers and most copper companies' operations were strong. Most chemical companies also posted booming profits, but the group's total was held down by Hercules, which reported a huge nonrecurring gain a year earlier. Similarly, a big loss at SmithKline masked strong earnings in the drug group.    Despite concern over the effects of the drought, food-products companies suffered few losses from the hot, dry summer, and grocery chains weren't hurt, either. Railroads lost grain traffic, but shipments generally rose; the group's total profit was held down by a huge net charge at Santa Fe Southern Pacific.    Weak groups included apparel; heavy construction, which managed only to narrow its losses; insurance, hard hit by price cutting in commercial property-casualty lines and high costs in group health operations; pipelines, suffering from unstable natural-gas prices and contract settlements; and securities firms, still lamenting the flight of individual investors.    Here are the third-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s are omitted.    AEROSPACE   Commercial-jet orders continued to boom in the third quarter, while the uncertain future of military programs spurred companies to restructure and reduce military-aerospace operations. Martin Marietta's net income was ballooned by a $135.7 million gain from sale of an overseas investment and other items; its operating earnings increased 12% from a year earlier. Lockheed's net was similarly aided by a $177 million gain from discontinued operations; its operating earnings resulted primarily from lower income-tax expense. Boeing's increased delivery rate for airliners offset problems with some military programs, and net jumped 38%. Northrop's earnings drop resulted from high research and development expenditures for the Advanced Tactical Fighter and B-2 Stealth bomber. Rockwell's aerospace earnings fell 30%, with the biggest blow the ending of the B-1 bomber program, but a lower tax provision and increased profit in nondefense sectors lifted fiscal-fourth-quarter net income 33%. Earnings at General Dynamics' Electric Boat shipbuilding division were hurt by a strike. McDonnell Douglas had a $26 million pretax gain from disposition of its interest in a health-maintenance organization, which was offset by restructuring costs. Fairchild, which has long been troubled, chalked up a big percentage gain, aided by a $2 million tax-loss carry-forward; a year earlier, the company also had several nonrecurring items. United Technologies had a $33.3 million pretax gain from the sale of subsidiaries.                             3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    13 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Boeing Co               144,000     104,000     + 38    Fairchild Inds            6,048         463    +1206    GenCorp                  19,000      17,000     + 12    General Dynamics         96,400     111,500     - 14    Lockheed Corp           300,000     101,000     +197    Martin Marietta         202,788      55,625     +265    McDonnell Doug           83,500      80,300     +  4    Northrop Corp            28,800      34,100     - 16    Rockwell Int'l          185,900     140,000     + 33    Rohr Industries           9,152       7,022     + 30    Sundstrand Corp          20,435      14,455     + 41    Textron Inc              62,800      55,100     + 14    United Technol          190,100     165,000     + 15    TOTAL                 1,348,923     885,565     + 52   AIRLINES   Profits surged, with several carriers posting record quarters. Most cited higher fares, lower fuel costs and increased traffic. A 7% increase in major carriers' September traffic was well ahead of the 4% gain for the first eight months, and the fourth-quarter outlook remains strong. The majors, led by United Airlines, increased discount fares effective Oct. 7. UAL also benefited from sale of a half interest in its reservations system, but even without that, the United Airlines parent's earnings rose to $179 million. An exception to the strong earnings was Pan American, whose net rose only 6%; most of that came from its Pan Am Express and Pan Am Shuttle operations. Texas Air's Continental unit earned $15.2 million, against a year-earlier loss, but the results were &quot;clearly unsatisfactory,&quot; Texas Air said, because the quarter is usually one of the strongest. The loss at Eastern, another Texas Air unit, widened to $112.9 million from $67.4 million.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    9 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    AMR Corp                150,282      87,130    + 72    Delta Air Lines          99,951      59,106    + 69    NWA Inc                 116,282      87,336    + 33    Pan Am Corp              67,378      63,365    +  6    Southwest Airlines       26,586      20,432    + 30    Texas Air              -114,100     -72,800     ...

Some apparel makers still are saddled with excess inventory, which also cuts into profits. Liz Claiborne, where net fell 11%, says its conservative inventory strategy could &quot;limit any potential sales and earnings increases&quot; through 1989's second quarter. Phillips Van Heusen's net plummeted 53% in the latest fiscal quarter; the company noted a $4.2 million after-tax interest expense stemming partly from its acquisition of G.H. Bass Co. and from a year-earlier recapitalization. Hartmarx blamed its 11% drop on start-up expenses with its Henry Grethel line and higher interest expenses from borrowings to buy back stock. But Genesco's net soared in its fiscal second quarter, mostly because of a 36% increase in sales of men's tailored clothing. Deborah Bronston, a Prudential-Bache analyst, believes that the fourth quarter may bring &quot;nominal, if any, sales growth&quot; to the industry.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    9 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Brown Group               6,020       5,896    +  2    Genesco Inc               3,594         395    +810    Hartmarx Corp             5,545       6,235    - 11    Liz Claiborne            31,614      35,520    - 11    Oxford Inds               3,524       3,357    +  5    Phillips-Van Heus         2,785       5,900    - 53    Reebok Int'l             37,067      49,723    - 25    Stride Rite Corp          9,811       6,840    + 43    V F Corp                 53,650      60,488    - 11    TOTAL                   153,610     174,354    - 12   AUTOS AND EQUIPMENT   The auto industry had a strong third quarter, but some clouds linger on Detroit's horizon. Combined profits at General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler totaled $1.83 billion, up 2.8% from a 1987 third period that was inflated by an accounting change at GM. But the surge in the latest quarter came entirely from record profits at Ford and GM. Chrysler, battered by high costs and lower production, saw earnings skid 54%. Its problems highlighted the troubles all three big U.S. auto makers are having in their own backyards. Their North American operations are being squeezed by rising raw-material costs and dependence on cash rebates and other sales incentives. Ford and GM were helped by booming overseas operations, but Chrysler relies almost entirely on North America, and suffered for it. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Big Three expect to raise their U.S. auto production about 9% from the depressed year-ago period. Analysts are lifting forecasts for GM in light of its surprisingly strong third quarter. But officials caution that sales incentives and other costs could continue to damp U.S. profits at all three companies.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    14 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Champion Spk Plg          2,400       4,700    - 49    Chrysler Corp           112,500     246,000    - 54    Cummins Engine          -17,625      -6,245     ...

In a reversal of sorts, the nation's 15 biggest banks outperformed the broader industry average, posting an 11.5% gain from a year earlier. The big banks benefited from restructuring, tax credits for prior reserve actions and cost containment at some of them. Overall, Midwestern banks showed the sharpest profit gains, reflecting the region's rebounding economy. In the most significant event of the quarter, major banks put past-due loans to Argentina on non-accrual status. That held down their net interest margins despite an increase in loan spreads, or the difference between what banks are paid by borrowers for loans and what they pay to depositors. Domestic nonperforming loans continued to drop as the credit quality of consumer-loan portfolios improved. Results from securities trading remained healthy. Fourth-quarter earnings should rise sharply at many big banks, and many of the banks are expected to report income from Brazilian loans. Banks have been setting those payments aside until a refinancing agreement had been signed with Brazil.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    26 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Bank of Boston           79,200      74,000    +  7    Bank of New England      72,300      61,500    + 18    Bank of New York         54,236      45,201    + 20    BankAmerica             190,000      54,000    +252    Bankers Trust           162,100     146,400    + 11    Barnett Banks Fla        58,300      48,300    + 21    Chase Manhttn           282,804     225,664    + 25    Chemical Banking        211,900     -66,400     ...

Coke's earnings jumped 9% despite a $40 million pretax gain in the 1987 third quarter. Its overseas business continued to show strong growth, but domestic volume trailed the soft-drink industry's 6% gain. Pepsi's domestic volume rose 8%, adding to another good showing by its restaurant and snack-foods business, says Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. But he adds that both companies &quot;will have to learn to raise product prices, or run the risk of losing the war for profits.&quot; Hot weather did less for beer consumption. Anheuser-Busch's volume, propelled by its Budweiser brands, continued to grow at a 3% annual clip, compared with the industry's 0.5%. But analysts say the effects of the drought will soon raise brewers' grain costs. Brown-Forman bounced back from losses on its California Cooler business to post a 23% profit gain, but General Cinema was hurt by higher promotional expenses and financing costs related to Cadbury Schweppes PLC.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    6 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Anheuser-Busch          226,502     195,225     + 16    Brown-Forman Inc         23,215      18,800     + 23    Coca-Cola Co            295,616     271,363     +  9    Coors (Adolph)           21,642      20,059     +  8    General Cinema           21,724      21,952     -  1    PepsiCo Inc             241,600     189,900     + 27    TOTAL                   830,299     717,299     + 16   BUILDING MATERIALS   &quot;The industry has been negatively influenced by a generally lower level of housing activity and signs of a slowing in the rate of remodeling activity,&quot; says Gregory Nejmeh, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. The industry as a whole &quot;did OK&quot; in the third quarter, he adds, &quot;but the rate of momentum in earnings gains&quot; has slowed a bit. Laurence H. Hirschhorn at First Boston notes that the hot weather this summer hurt the housing industry. USG says its results aren't truly comparable to the 1987 third quarter's because of a huge recapitalization approved last July. Ideal Basic's revenue fell 11% largely because of a 12% drop in cement shipments, partly offset by an average 2.1% rise in cement prices. Owens-Corning's profit surged, though Mr. Nejmeh notes that some of the strength came from businesses tied more to other economic sectors than to building products. PPG's three segments -- glass, coatings and resins, and chemicals -- posted sales and profit gains in the quarter. Mr. Hirschhorn sees a &quot;mild contraction&quot; in the building-products industry over the next year.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    12 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Armstrong World          42,900      43,900    -  2    Giant Group Ltd          -4,398       5,046     ...

Commodity chemical companies posted the biggest increases, while concerns with specialty products and less cyclical vulnerability had flatter earnings. Capacity-expansion plans remain conservative, and prices are expected to stay high at least through the end of the decade. Ethyl benefited from an $8.8 million gain from settlement of a lawsuit. Du Pont sustained a loss in its Conoco energy unit's exploration and production business and in the biomedical field; its 1987 third quarter included a $31 million gain from sale of a business. Goodrich had an $8 million loss from discontinued operations; a year earlier, it had a $13.6 million gain from a tax-loss carry-forward. Hercules's net was depressed by a $5.4 million loss from disposal of a business, against a year-earlier gain of $533.8 million from the sale of other businesses. In the 1987 quarter, International Minerals had a tax-loss carry-forward credit of $8.5 million, and Morton-Thiokol had a $14.1 million charge from an accounting change. Union Carbide profited from big gains in its core chemical and plastics businesses.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    21 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Air Pdts andamp; Chem          50,374      39,075    + 29    American Cyanamid        64,100      66,300    -  3    Dow Chemical            632,000     330,000    + 92    Du Pont Co              461,000     452,000    +  2    Engelhard Corp           16,924      14,743    + 15    Ethyl Corp               62,202      46,260    + 34    Goodrich B F Co          60,800      42,400    + 43    Grace W R                50,537      41,455    + 22    Hanna M A Co             24,916      10,025    +149    Hercules Inc             26,762     584,091    - 95    Int'l Min andamp; Chm          28,800      30,800    -  6    Lubrizol                 10,683      18,913    - 44    Monsanto Co             116,000     100,000    + 16    Morton-Thiokol           41,313      26,538    + 56    Olin Corp                19,000      15,000    + 27    Pennwalt Corp             7,937       9,382    - 15    Quantum Chemical         99,800      27,600    +262    Rohm andamp; Haas              49,800      39,300    + 27    Sherwin-Williams         37,820      36,423    +  4    Union Carbide           213,000      74,000    +188    Witco Corp               20,036      17,737    + 13    TOTAL                 2,093,804   2,022,042    +  4   DRUG MAKERS   Most profits were especially robust, in one of the best quarters in a string of recent strong periods, but the group's totals were pulled down by SmithKline's big loss. The loss reflected an after-tax charge of $292.6 million for restructuring and plunging sales of the company's ulcer drug, Tagamet. The widespread profit gains stemmed mostly from introduction of new, higher-priced drugs, increased prices for older products, and favorable foreign-exchange and tax rates. Several companies also benefited from a favorable product mix, thanks to having shed less profitable businesses in recent years. Merck's profit rose 31% even though sales climbed only 12%; the company was aided by cost controls, lower tax rates and big-margin drugs. Squibb's profit rise was held down by higher marketing costs to battle competition for its heart drug, Capoten.

Among semiconductor concerns, Intel's net surged; shipments of its 386 microprocessor continued strong. At Motorola, the semiconductor-products sector's operating profit rose sharply on 23% higher sales. However, National Semiconductor's loss reflected a $16.6 million pretax restructuring charge and slowing demand for large systems. Varian's profit surge included a $9.6 million gain from sale of its specialty-metals unit. Maytag and Whirlpool, two appliance makers, were pinched by higher parts costs. Honeywell's loss reflected charges tied to the Sperry defense-avionics business acquired from Unisys. Zenith posted a $2.6 million gain on disposition of properties, while the 1987 quarter included $16 million of severance and early-retirement charges and a $9.7 million tax credit. Square D stepped up product-development and marketing outlays, and stock buy-backs raised its interest expense. For the chip industry, the outlook is &quot;cautious optimism, based on continued growth in the manufacturing sector in 1989,&quot; says Adam Cuhney of Kidder Peabody. For appliance makers, Nicholas P. Heymann of Drexel sees &quot;continued and steady softness&quot; for as long as two years; heavy debt and higher interest rates are &quot;starting to chip away at consumers' disposable income,&quot; he says. In electrical equipment, &quot;we are drawing towards the end of a cyclical improvement in the capital-goods business,&quot; Mr. Heymann says, with export sales slowing but domestic industry continuing its &quot;sizable capital spending.&quot;                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    29 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    AMP Inc                  72,371      62,782    + 15    Arrow Electronics        10,099       5,524    + 83    AVX Corp                  7,306       3,933    + 86    Baldor Electric           2,765       1,689    + 64    Cooper Indust            57,017      44,411    + 28    CTS Corp                  2,766       3,720    - 26    Emerson Electric        134,100     123,500    +  9    General Electric        815,000     661,000    + 23    General Instrument       21,661      14,984    + 45    Grainger W W             29,782      23,315    + 28    Honeywell Inc           -22,200      69,600     ...

The profits &quot;look good,&quot; says Ronald Strauss, a William Blair analyst. Earnings at Holly Farms surged largely because of higher chicken prices. Poultry profits also helped ConAgra. Kellogg's earnings were lifted by lower taxes and gains in ready-to-eat cereals, especially in international markets. Aided by strong consumer demand for pork, Wilson Foods' profit jumped. Nonrecurring items skewed some year-to-year comparisons. Pillsbury's net was helped by a $14 million benefit from an accounting change, and General Mills by $199.1 million in income from discontinued operations. Discontinued-operations income of $7.1 million and a $53.4 million gain from the sale of Friendly Ice Cream Stores aided Hershey Foods. Despite drought-related price increases, CPC International profits also rose, partly because of higher volume in consumer foods and stronger prices.

Scott Paper's sharply higher net included a $117.3 million gain from sale of a unit, partly offset by $28.3 million in charges due to early-retirement programs and write-downs. Mead had a $100.9 million gain from asset sales; the year-earlier period included a similar $42.8 million gain. Boise Cascade's lumber-product operations were hurt by a nine-week strike at about half its mills. Fort Howard was held down by costs associated with the leveraged buy-out through which it went private last month. Westvaco's profit rose even though a year earlier it had a $12.6 million gain from annuitization of certain liabilities, partially offset by higher expenses for new-product development. The paper market's strength is expected to continue at least into next year, but analysts note that additional capacity coming on-line could eventually erode prices. Part of the industry's boom is due to the dollar's drop; if it rebounds, so may pressure from paper imports.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    19 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Boise Cascade            71,900      50,390    + 43    Bowater Inc              40,025      23,010    + 74    Champion Int'l          122,386      88,694    + 38    Federal Paper Board      34,708      21,124    + 64    Fort Howard              45,801      45,821       0    Georgia-Pacific         114,000     118,000    -  3    Great Northern Nekoosa   92,300      55,700    + 66    Int'l Paper             201,000     102,000    + 97    James River Cp           56,222      47,312    + 19    Kimberly-Clark           90,500      84,100    +  8    Louisiana-Pacific        36,700      42,600    - 14    Mead Corp               170,500      97,400    + 75    Potlatch Corp            28,292      22,604    + 25    Scott Paper             170,700      58,500    +192    Stone Container          89,100      44,500    +100    Union Camp               75,052      56,537    + 33    Westvaco Corp            51,809      43,162    + 20    Weyerhaeuser Co         144,812     126,123    + 15    Willamette Inds          38,962      31,954    + 22    TOTAL                 1,674,769   1,159,531    + 44   GROCERY CHAINS   With a few exceptions, the recent trend of solid, low-key earnings growth continued in the latest period. Borman's is having problems with some stores in the West that it is selling. Circle K said its net was hurt by &quot;continued depressed economies&quot; in some operating areas; its year-earlier profit was aided by a $5.5 million accounting change. Earnings at American Stores were battered by heavy interest expenses and other costs associated with its recent $2.51 billion buy-out of Lucky Stores. Fears that grocers' margins could be trimmed by price increases due to last summer's drought haven't been borne out so far, and the industry's general uptrend is expected to continue.

However, the patient mix included a higher proportion of less profitable Medicare patients, and margins were squeezed by rising labor costs and other expenses. Operating earnings are rising 5% to 8% this year and will grow about that in 1989, Seth Shaw, a Prudential-Bache Securities analyst, predicts. Humana posted narrower losses in group health-insurance operations, which it expects to break even next year. Hospital Corp. of America's year-ago loss included $140 million in income-tax expense related to the sale of 104 hospitals in August 1987 and pretax charges of $199 million to write down certain investments and increase reserves for doubtful accounts. American Medical International's net was depressed by a $6.8 million charge for severance costs; a year earlier, it had a $5.9 million debt-repurchase charge. National Medical Enterprises's profits were depressed by its nursing homes. Beverly Enterprises's deficit included pretax losses of $6.2 million from nursing-home sales and $3.3 million from expenses related to the sale of notes receivable. Margo Vignola of Salomon Brothers thinks higher Medicaid reimbursements and reduced labor-cost pressure will help the nursing-home industry turn profitable next year.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    7 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Amer Medical Intl        18,255      17,176    +  6    Bausch andamp; Lomb            28,744      25,325    + 14    Baxter International     85,000      90,000    -  6    Beverly Enterpr         -11,484       3,579     ...

Fluor, the strongest of the group, says new awards at its engineering and construction unit more than doubled from a year ago, and the backlog increased 35%. Mark Altman, a PaineWebber analyst, suggests that the other companies also may soon improve. &quot;Order rates are moving up and prices for contracts continue to firm,&quot; he says. Blount's deficit for the Aug. 31 quarter included an $8 million write-down on a construction project; a year ago, it had a $4.3 million construction-related charge. Morrison Knudsen's loss included a net pretax charge of $86 million for write-offs, reserves for anticipated contract losses and the establishment of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan; a year earlier, the company also had a plethora of one-time items, amounting to a net pretax charge of $106.8 million. In the year-earlier quarter, Fluor had a $5 million loss from discontinued operations.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    6 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Ameron Inc                2,669       4,541    - 41    Blount Inc               -1,116         197     ...

HOME BUILDERS   Once again, big home builders' profits show the effects of regional differences. &quot;Those that were heavily in Texas and Denver continue to pay a price for that,&quot; says Barbara Allen, a Prudential-Bache Securities analyst. &quot;But California -- if you're there, you're making money.&quot; Kaufman andamp; Broad, based in Los Angeles, increased its backlog 51% to $306 million on the strength of sales in California and France. Ryland Group's California joint ventures again contributed the lion's share to the Columbia, Md., builder's earnings. Cost cutting at U.S. Home produced a profit despite a modest decline in the Houston-based company's Sept. 30 backlog. Home sales on Florida's West Coast, which accounted for a third of the company's sales, declined 13%. &quot;It's a much more difficult market than it was two or three years ago&quot; there, a spokeswoman says.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    3 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Kaufmanandamp;BroadHm          12,391       8,775    + 41    Ryland Group             13,910      11,550    + 20    U S Home                  1,072      -3,587     ...

Profits &quot;were good but not terrific,&quot; says Eli Lustgarten, a PaineWebber analyst. Analysts are optimistic for the fourth quarter and next year as companies gear up production and increases in raw-material costs abate. &quot;You should get further benefit from increased domestic and international demand next year,&quot; says First Boston's John McGinty. Deere turned in a solid quarter, alleviating fear that the drought would drag down earnings. AM International's fiscal fourth quarter included a $15.6 million loss from discontinued operations and an $18.1 million charge due to write-offs in its computer-graphics business; a year earlier, it had a $5 million loss from discontinued operations.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    11 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Allis-Chalmers           -2,813      -5,753     ...

In property-casualty, most analysts and executives expect declines in rates and earnings to continue at least another year. But they predict that higher tax rates and the prospect of operating losses will discourage price slashing. In group health, double-digit price increases and cost cutting are reviving depressed results at many companies. Fireman's Fund and Home Group have resisted the temptation to slash rates; consequently, premium volume slowed at both and their results suffered especially sharply. The year-to-year comparison for Fireman's Fund also was hurt by the $229 million of capital gains that the company recorded a year earlier from cashing in its equity holdings before the stock-market crash. Lower investment returns this year also hurt Chubb's results, which included a $6.6 million charge related to its drought-insurance program. Aetna Life andamp; Casualty's net fell because of lower property-casualty and group-health results, but an official says market conditions indicate that the property-casualty earnings slump won't be severe. He adds that the company's group-health-insurance prices now are more in line with costs.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    18 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Aetna Life andamp; Cas        235,400     254,000    -  7    Amer Int'l Group        273,865     261,583    +  5    American General         95,929     162,223    - 41    Chubb Corp               90,200      96,100    -  6    CIGNA Corp              114,200     191,300    - 40    CNA Financial           118,777     108,360    + 10    Continental Corp        -28,200      87,000     ...

Advertising remains soft with few signs of a rebound. Two exceptions were Warner Communications, which had big gains in films, records and cable TV, and Tribune Co., which had strong ad sales. Capital Cities/ABC's 63% surge in net dwindles to 15% if various financial items are excluded. CBS's 16% rise came mostly from soaring interest income; some analysts expect its network to lose up to $30 million this quarter. Macmillan's loss included a $29.4 million charge for inventory disposal and $39.7 million in expenses of fighting a takeover bid. McGraw-Hill's profit benefited from gains from disposed operations. Newspaper companies had a tough quarter. Ad linage dropped at Dow Jones and New York Times Co. and rose only 1% at Gannett. Times-Mirror's net included a $26.5 million gain from timberland sales. Washington Post Co.'s net fell because a year earlier it had a $30.2 million gain on asset sales; without that, its net would have risen 23%. Time Inc.'s net included $12.5 million from its stake in Turner Broadcasting System and a $19.9 million pretax charge; year-earlier net included $15.3 million from a magazine sale.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    19 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Cap Cities-ABC           62,634      38,436    + 63    CBS Inc                  69,900      60,100    + 16    Chris-Craft Inds          6,418         747    +759    Dow Jones andamp; Co           31,992      36,839    - 13    Dun andamp; Bradstreet        134,800     115,721    + 16    Gannett Co               75,121      70,519    +  7    Gulf andamp; Western          123,800     102,600    + 21    Harcourt Brace J         80,421      75,506    +  7    Knight-Ridder            31,998      33,449    -  4    Macmillan Inc            -1,057      43,315     ...

Alcoa's third-quarter net more than doubled, despite a $9.9 million charge for a new profit-sharing plan. KaiserTech was aided by a $19.1 million tax benefit. Alcoa said aluminum orders and industry inventories suggest continued strong results, at least through the beginning of next year. Aluminum prices may firm further as customers build supplies to hedge against possible strikes at Alcoa and Reynolds, where union contracts expire next May. Several companies with strong operating profits reported lower net income because of big nonrecurring gains a year earlier. Amax, where earnings from continuing operations more than doubled to $199.5 million, had a 25% drop in net after a $126 million pretax gain in the 1987 quarter from sale of part of its interest in its Amax Gold unit. Asarco had a $212.8 million year-earlier gain on asset sales. Phelps Dodge's profit soared 62% on strong sales, mostly in copper. Like Asarco, it said good demand in non-mining businesses helped earnings. Hecla blamed its profit drop on lower gold prices.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    10 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Aluminum Co Am          226,300     109,000    +108    AMAX                    132,500     176,200    - 25    ASARCO Inc               45,944     227,480    - 80    Callahan Mining            -625         558     ...

Those trends are likely to continue through the fourth quarter. International Business Machines' earnings rose only slightly because it is going through a transition in its mainframe and minicomputer lines, but a fourth-quarter surge is expected as sales of the new machines kick in. Digital Equipment, a minicomputer maker whose earnings were at the low end of analysts' expectations, is expected to see profit margins continue to shrink. Similarly, Unisys and NCR, which also disappointed investors, have scaled back their growth predictions because of weak U.S. sales. But personal-computer companies such as Compaq are expected to continue to outgrow the rest of the industry.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    18 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Amdahl Corp              53,388      36,784    + 45    Apple Computer          107,919      71,678    + 51    Compaq Computer          57,870      36,438    + 59    Control Data             -2,400       6,800     ...

Nonetheless, profits increased for some large oil-service companies because of diversification, restructuring and cost cutting, combined with decreased competition. In the 1987 third quarter, Schlumberger had a $220 million loss from discontinued operations and a $70 million gain from an award from the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. Though the industry's outlook remains bleak because of weak crude-oil prices, other segments of the companies, such as petrochemical-plant construction, are expected to be strong.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    3 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Cameron Iron Wks          4,268       2,791    + 53    Dresser Industries       41,800      22,000    + 90    Schlumberger Ltd        112,152       1,697   +6509    TOTAL                   158,220      26,488   + 497   PETROLEUM   Earnings for most oil companies soared as demand for gasoline and petrochemicals continued to grow and prices of crude oil, the raw material, plunged. Huge profits in the refining, marketing and petrochemicals businesses more than offset a slump in exploration and production earnings. In addition, the benefits of cost-cutting programs initiated several years ago are being realized. Oil companies are expected to remain highly profitable in the fourth quarter despite strife within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and uncertain oil prices. Among the major third-quarter gainers was Mobil, where net rose 69% despite a $65 million write-down of foreign properties. However, profit fell at Amerada Hess and Sun. Amerada uses first in-first out accounting, which causes earnings to drop when oil prices fall. Sun's decline is due primarily to a $62 million windfall-profit-tax gain in the 1987 third quarter. Ashland, which should have benefited from lower oil prices, reported flat earnings as a result of a restatement of year-earlier net because it restructured its coal operations.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    22 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    Amerada Hess             15,765      38,570    - 59    American Petrofina       35,157      21,167    + 66    Amoco Corp              552,000     412,000    + 34    Ashland Oil Inc          66,241      65,530    +  1    Atlantic Richfield      391,000     315,000    + 24    Chevron Corp            420,000     297,000    + 41    Crown Central P          15,317      -3,088     ...

Texas Eastern attributed its huge profit rise to an $131 million after-tax gain from sale of half of its 20% interest in North Sea oil fields. Despite a modest rebound in natural-gas prices, Enron, the nation's largest pipeline operator, reported a loss from continuing operations &quot;largely attributable to squeezed margins&quot; due to lower oil prices, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said. Panhandle Eastern blamed its loss on a $244 million charge from settlements of natural-gas contracts. Tenneco's third-quarter report was the first after its $7.3 billion sale of oil and gas properties. Its pipeline unit, which provides about a quarter of its revenue, earned about $45 million, down from $69 million a year earlier; the company blamed increased competition.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    6 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Coastal Corp              9,200      11,700    - 21    Consol Nat Gas           -8,288      -3,991     ...

RAILROADS   The group's results were held down by a $665 million net charge at Santa Fe Southern Pacific from sale of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. But operating profits generally improved. Fuel costs fell more than 20% from year-earlier levels, and carloadings rose 2.5%. Shipments of most commodities increased, with coal up 2.9%, motor vehicles 7.6%, intermodal 14%, metals 7.5% and chemicals 5.2%. But grain shipments dropped 11% because of the drought and lower export sales. Norfolk Southern posted record earnings, excluding a pretax restructuring charge of $620.4 million a year ago. At Union Pacific, an 11% gain in carloadings raised operating profit 7%, excluding a $23 million after-tax gain in the 1987 third quarter. Burlington Northern said its railroad traffic increased 6%, but the decline in railroad operating profit reflected higher depreciation expense. Analysts expect the industry to continue to benefit from gains in labor productivity, but they see the growth in freight shipments that began late last year moderating because of comparisons with the strong 1987 fourth quarter.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    8 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Burlington Nrthn        120,359     141,266    - 15    CNW Corp                 12,057      13,972    - 14    Consolidated Rail        83,000      62,000    + 34    CSX Corp                120,000     104,000    + 15    Norfolk Southern        179,400    -248,500     ...

Sears Roebuck, whose net fell 16% in the calendar quarter, was an anomaly; its merchandise group's profit fell 21% because of what analysts term a deterioration in the company's basic business of selling through its 825 stores and its catalogs. Analysts say most major retailers benefited from a modest gain in sales, especially apparel sales. Gross margins improved, partly because discounts and promotions weren't as frequent or severe. Furthermore, retailers' third-quarter earnings this year will look good in contrast to last year's depressed levels. Dayton Hudson should be especially strong, analysts say, partly because of a turnaround at its Mervyn's soft-goods chain.

Lower market activity continued to depress trading profits, while merger-and-acquisition operations and investment banking generally remained slow. Special items affected year-to-year comparisons. PaineWebber posted a $46 million pretax gain from sale of its stake in National Car Rental System and a $20 million charge related to moving some operations to New Jersey. For the 1987 third quarter, American Express's profit was restated upward by $76 million to reflect a change in income-tax accounting, and Merrill Lynch had a $100.3 million after-tax gain from selling its right to buy an interest in its New York headquarters. The fourth quarter, Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache says, should be stronger, with increasing merger and acquisition activity and more investment banking. But that activity &quot;may mask the fact that business is still generally slow,&quot; he adds. &quot;Basically, what we need is for the individual investor to get off the couch.&quot;                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    6 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    American Express        282,100     324,100    - 13    First Boston Corp        41,662      40,801    +  2    Merrill Lynch            65,623     195,091    - 66    Morgan Stanley           52,438      72,916    - 28    PaineWebber Grp          20,928      14,814    + 41    Salomon Inc              65,000      27,000    +141    TOTAL                   527,751     674,722    - 22   SOAPS AND COSMETICS   Results were slightly disappointing, except for Procter andamp; Gamble, which stood out as the &quot;re-emerging and dominant company in the industry,&quot; says Daniel Meade at First Boston. Pandamp;G's unit shipments rose 5% in the U.S. and 15% overseas, he adds. Avon posted a loss because of a $425 million after-tax provision for discontinued operations, but reported earnings for continuing beauty-products businesses up 8%. Gillette's sales were strong in razor blades, its main business, but legal expenses for the issuance of stock rights hurt earnings. Colgate reported a turnaround from last year, when it posted a loss because of a $150 million restructuring charge. Margins improved, with pretax profit up 23%. Mr. Meade calls the lack of unit growth &quot;disappointing,&quot; but Nancy Hall at Smith Barney, Harris Upham says &quot;price increases stuck; therefore, nominal sales were up and . . . sales were more profitable.&quot;                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    4 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Avon Products          -405,900      26,600     ...

Inland, for example, posted a huge profit gain as it rebounded from a weak year-earlier quarter. Moreover, the outlook is bright, with demand for steel goods still brisk. The build-up of consumer inventories -- the major short-term problem facing the industry -- seems to be easing. At many of the companies, net income was affected by one-time items. Bethlehem, for example, had a $20 million loss from the sale of its anthracite operations, a $30 million charge to reflect possible contract losses at its marine division, a $38 million charge from the sale of its wire-rope business and a $3.8 million gain from debt repurchases; in the year-earlier quarter, it had a $32.5 million investment tax credit, a $3 million pretax gain from last-in first-out inventory liquidations and a $6 million pretax charge. Lukens had a $1.1 million pretax gain from the sale of a facility. Wheeling Pittsburgh had an extraordinary tax credit of $31.5 million and a pretax gain of $45.9 million on the sale of securities; a year before, it had a tax gain of $10.6 million.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    8 Firms                   1988        1987      Chg    Armco Inc                36,700      25,800    + 42    Bethlehem Steel         101,400      30,400    +234    Carpenter Tech            6,567       2,086    +215    Inland Steel             61,025       5,566    +996    Laclede Steel             5,126         882    +481    Lukens Inc                8,509       6,057    + 40    Nucor                    17,033      12,696    + 34    Wheeling Pitts Stl       96,594      25,771    +275    TOTAL                   332,954     109,258    +205   TELEPHONE COMPANIES   Results were mixed, although profits at most long-distance companies soared. MCI's earnings surged because of continued cost containment and strong growth in every market segment. Its earnings included an $11 million pretax gain from antitrust settlements, an $8 million charge on a contract settlement and a $5 million accrual for dividends on preferred shares issued to International Business Machines. ATandamp;T's earnings reflected double-digit growth from products and a 4% increase in traffic. GTE's profit, which included a $55 million pretax charge for restructuring, reflected surprising strength in telephone operations. Profits at Contel and United Telecom jumped primarily because of depressed year-earlier results. Among the Bell companies, Ameritech's profits fell, reflecting an $8.2 million loss on the sale of its Applied Data Research unit. Despite strong business growth, BellSouth's earnings were eroded by expansion outlays and accounting changes. Earnings growth at Nynex was partially offset by investments in nontelephone operations, and U S West's profits were squeezed by regulatory constraints. Southwestern Bell was hampered by weak economies in Texas and Oklahoma but benefited from a $16 million tax adjustment. Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis posted healthy earnings growth.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    13 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    American Info Tech      281,100     301,100    -  7    American Tel andamp; Tel      587,000     505,000    + 16    Bell Atlantic           341,000     321,800    +  6    BellSouth               419,600     418,600       0    Centel Corp              37,313      39,173    -  5    Contel Corp              62,356      34,424    + 81    GTE Corp                312,713     296,712    +  5    MCI Communic            104,000      17,000    +512    Nynex Corp              338,900     332,100    +  2    Pacific Telesis         318,000     302,000    +  5    Southwestern Bell       323,300     314,100    +  3    U S West Inc            283,200     277,500    +  2    United Telecomm          54,024      24,126    +124    TOTAL                 3,462,506   3,183,635    +  9   TEXTILES   West Point-Pepperell, currently under siege from Chicago investor William Farley, topped analysts' expectations by posting a 6% earnings gain, aided by sharply higher profits in household fabrics and by its acquisition of J.P.

The company had only a $1 million inventory-accounting charge, down from $10 million a year earlier, and its gross sales margin improved to 20% from 17%.

Several reported significant earnings increases, largely fueled by asset growth. Earnings of others declined because of narrowing spreads between deposit costs and loan yields or because of charges to raise loan-loss reserves and restructure operations. Great American First Savings Bank made a $33.2 million provision for loan losses, mostly to cover commercial real-estate loans in Arizona; the year-earlier provision was $5 million. Glenfed took an unspecified charge to close mortgage-banking offices. CalFed also closed some mortgage-banking offices, but its profit was depressed mostly by a 15% drop in net interest income, the difference between interest received on loans and that paid on deposits. Meritor's huge year-earlier loss was caused by charges totaling $377 million to write down good will resulting from a 1982 acquisition, raise loan-loss reserves and restructure its balance sheet. Gibraltar's year-earlier loss was due to $239 million in charges to write down real-estate projects and set up loss reserves. Unless interest rates rise rapidly, analysts expect profits of big thrifts such as Ahmanson, Great Western and Home Federal to keep rising in the fourth quarter.                            3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr      %    13 Firms                  1988        1987      Chg    AhmansonHFandamp;Co            56,130      43,378    + 29    CalFed Inc               42,400      50,600    - 16    Coast Sav andamp; Loan         11,713      15,475    - 24    CrossLand Savings        27,062      21,373    + 27    First Fed Mich            6,601       5,709    + 16    Gibraltar Finl          -23,954    -154,588     ...

TOBACCO   Despite a 2% annual decline in cigarette consumption, tobacco companies continued to benefit from unit gains overseas, double-digit cigarette-price increases and lower tax rates. At American Brands, cigarette operating earnings rose 19%, fueled by gains in market share in Britain and by the weak dollar. After two quarters of trade-inventory reductions, RJR's tobacco sales rebounded. Despite increased marketing expenditures, Philip Morris's operating profit from tobacco grew about 15%. Philip Morris expects a profit gain of 30% this year but only a 15% increase next year, following completion of its planned $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft. Analysts are uncertain about growth prospects at RJR, where management is trying to take the company private. &quot;The thing that is changing here is that the leading companies in the industry are taking on an enormous amount of debt,&quot; says Marc Bernstein, an analyst at Sanford C.
