Typically 5-10% of the electrical energy storedin the bank is converted into X-ray radiations with wavelengths lessthan 100 A. Such devices have applications in X-ray microscopy, lithography,spectroscopy and X-ray optics engineering. Here the authors present theresults of a parametric study of the X-ray emission from a small gaspuff Z-pinch which has 4kJ of stored electrical energy. The quantitiesmeasured are the soft X-ray emission in the wavelength range 4 to 85A and the hard X-ray emission with wavelength less than 2.5 A. Thesequantities are found to depend on the gas used and the mass of gas imploded.Conditions exist that maximise the soft X-ray emission from the pinch.It is also shown that the hard X-ray emission can be reduced significantlyby changing the anode material and by varying the mass of the gas imploded.</TEXT></DOC>
