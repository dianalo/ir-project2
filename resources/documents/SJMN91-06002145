Thesugar ration of 3.3 pounds per person per month has been effectively cut to1.15 pounds per month. Redemptions of tea coupons have slipped from about 4.5ounces per person to about 1.8 ounces.;    With government food suppliesseverely reduced, more and more Iraqi families are being forced into the openfood market, where prices of basic food items are seven times higher than theywere at the outset of the crisis, but where shortages of rice, sugar and milkhave become more apparent.;    Some reports have held that the sanctions arerelatively ineffective, that Iraq's &quot;porous&quot; borders with Jordan, Iran, Turkeyand -- to some extent -- Syria have allowed all kinds of goods into thecountry. The reports say that Iraqis are able to buy whatever food they needalthough they pay considerably more than they did before the embargo.;    OneAsian ambassador disagreed.;    &quot;Sanctions are working, no matter what anybodysays,&quot; the ambassador said in an interview, noting that basics like eggs andfresh milk have either disappeared or have been priced beyond the reach ofmost Iraqi families. &quot;The country has had no income in the last five months,so there has got to be a limit to their endurance.&quot;;    The strongestindication of a looming food crisis was a government announcement 10 days agothat all excess supplies of sugar and flour on the open market were to beconfiscated by Iraqi authorities administering the rationing program.;    Lastweek, government agents swept through food stores in Baghdad confiscating thescarce staple foods that were in private hands and for sale at wildly inflatedfree-market prices, according to a number of Iraqi witnesses.;    Of basicfood groups, meat has suffered the least price inflation, but prices havestill almost doubled. Foreign diplomats said that meat prices have beenmoderated somewhat by an increase in the slaughter in Iraq's sheep herds lastfall, but with the end of the slaughter season, prices are expected to move upmore rapidly in coming weeks as supplies tighten.;    One luxury hotel indowntown Baghdad is still serving T-bone steaks taken from Kuwait, but thesesupplies are dwindling rapidly.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PATRICK E.
