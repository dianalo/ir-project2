Californians imposed a lifetime cap on an individual's service,granting a total of six years - three terms - for Assembly membersand eight years - two terms - for state senators. The eight-yearlimit also applies to statewide officers.   The change will rock the ``careerists'' in the statelegislature, said Lewis Uhler, co-sponsor of the proposition. ``Itdemonstrates the depth of feeling on the part of the people andhelps to launch a national crusade,'' he said.   The measure also eliminated the legislature's pension programand cut its operating budget about 40 percent.   Californians defeated another measure, backed by consumeradvocate Ralph Nader and Common Cause, to limit statewide officersto eight consecutive years and allow legislators only 12consecutive years in each house.   The Colorado measure, the biggest vote-getter on the stateballot, imposed a limit of eight consecutive years for holding asingle state office.   It applies to the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary ofstate, treasurer, attorney general and seats in the statelegislature.   It also would limit members of the U.S. Senate and House to 12years in office, but such state limits on federal offices may bevulnerable to a constitutional challenge.   The measure won support from 71 percent of voters.   The vote signaled that voters support sweeping reform, saidstate Sen. Terry Considine, the driving force behind Amendment 5.   ``On Amendment 5, it came as no surprise to me there was such anoverwhelming number supporting it,'' he said. ``Colorado has set anexample that will be imitated all across our country. People from30 states worked with me on this, and I think we can get reforms inCongress.''   Kansas City residents limited city council members and the mayorto two consecutive four-year terms. Council members can run againafter sitting out a term.   The measure, which passed 36,596 to 31,379, prevents nine of thecurrent 13 council members from seeking re-election in the spring.   ``Eight years is enough,'' said Henry E. Lyons, a real estatedeveloper who was behind the move to get the proposal on theballot.   Apart from Tuesday's contests, efforts are under way to limitterms of office in Florida, Illinois, New York and Ohio. Severalstates are also considering constitutional amendments to limitterms in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.   In another measure of voter sentiment, Arizona defeated aproposed pay raise for legislators by a margin of 2 to 1.</TEXT></DOC>
