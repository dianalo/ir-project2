<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0932 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the first time, on the basis of commercial-geological data, calculationshave been made of the contents of the giant deposits of the world classifyingthem as to groupings of hydrocarbon systems (bitumen-oil, oil, gas-oil,oil-gas, gas-condensate, and gas). The distribution of hydrocarbons inthe various systems, based on depth of occurrence, has been evaluatedfor deposits with reserves of at least 100M tons. The authors lookedat 506 such deposits. Of these, data used in calculating the masses ofhydrocarbons on the basis of depth of occurrence came from 452 deposits.The author discusses global patterns of vertical distribution of hydrocarbonsin sedimentary basins, and the resulting implications for explorationstrategies, concluding that emphasis on deep drilling for the discoveryof new gas fields may not be justified. 6 references, 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
