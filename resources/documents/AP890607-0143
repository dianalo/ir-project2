MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violence against gay people continued to be``alarmingly widespread'' last year, said a report releasedWednesday by the National Gay andamp; Lesbian Task Force.   A total of 7,248 incidents, ranging from harassment to homicide,were reported to the group in 1988 by 120 organizations in 38 statesand the District of Columbia.   About two-thirds of the incidents were verbal harassment,according to the report. The remainder were: physical assaults, 12percent; threats of violence or menacing, 10 percent; vandalism, 6percent; police abuse, 3 percent; bomb threats, 1 percent; andhomicide, arson and ``other,'' 1 percent. The ``other'' categoryincludes police negligence, attempted violence and one kidnapping.   ``As in past years, anti-gay violence and victimization proved tobe alarmingly widespread in 1988,'' author Kevin Berrill said at anews conference called Wednesday to release the annual study, thegroup's fourth.   ``This report does not claim to measure the full extent ofanti-gay violence and victimiazation that occurred last year,'' headded. ``Without question, the vast majority of anti-gay episodes in1988 were not counted.''   Claudia Brenner of Ithaca, N.Y., victim of one of the morevicious anti-gay episodes last year, spoke at the news conference``because it's too easy in our world of murder and death statisticsto forget that there are actually people'' behind the numbers.   ``The fact that crimes are targeted against particular groups _in this case, lesbians _ requires a societal response,'' Brennersaid, calling for passage of the Hate Crime Statistics bill, whichis pending in both houses of Congress.   Brenner, a 31-year-old architect, was camping in Pennsylvaniawith her lover, Rebecca Wight, last May when a man who had beenstalking them in the woods opened fire. Wight was killed but Brennersurvived, despite being shot at least five times. Their assailant,Stephen Roy Carr, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentencedto life in prison without parole.   The report noted a disturbing rise in the number of hate groups _mostly neo-Nazi skinheads _ attacking gay people.   ``Although most of the perpetrators of anti-gay violence are notaffiliated with organized hate groups, hate groups pose anunprecedented and growing threat to the lesbian and gay community,''Berrill said. ``Nineteen organizations representing 17 communitiesacross the U.S. reported anti-gay activity by hate groups last year,most of it perpetrated by neo-Nazi skinheads.''   The report also provides evidence that homosexuals are beingincreasingly victimized on college campuses.   Nineteen percent of the anti-gay incidents reported last yeartook place on college campuses, the report found. Seventeen percentwere classified as AIDS-related, ``indicating that hatred and blameassociated with the epidemic continue unabated.''   There were 240 more incidents documented in 1988 than in 1987,the report said. It attributed the increase to a special request forinformation from the Metropolitan Community Churches, which have aspecial ministry to the gay and lesbian community, and to campus gayand lesbian organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
