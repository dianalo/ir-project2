This approach enablesthe petroleum-producing firm to evaluate and rank reserve-replacementprojects from the three principal sources listed below in order to maximizethe return on invested capital. The methodology is based on the discountedcash flow approach to valuation of the oil and gas reserves obtained(1) by exploration, (2) by direct purchase of reserves, and (3) by acquisitionof an entire petroleum firm. The reserve-replacement projects are evaluatedand ranked to determine an optimal portfolio of reserve-replacement projects.Cost per barrel alone is shown to be ineffective as an evaluation toolbecause it may lead to economic decisions that do not maximize the valueof the firm. When used with other economic decision criteria, cost perbarrel is useful as a downside economic indicator by showing which projectswill fare better under unfavorable price scenarios. Important factorsaffecting the valuation of an acquisition (in addition to the oil andgas reserves) are shown by this study to be purchase price, other assetsincluding cash, future tax savings from operating losses carried forward,and liabilities, primarily long-term debt.</TEXT></DOC>
