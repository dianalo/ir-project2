They had high hopes of serving the first president since Calvin Coolidge to share their fervent conviction that markets work best when free of governmental interference.    Today, many of those free-market advocates are dejected. The compromises of the Reagan years have been a disappointment; but even more disappointing is the rise of Vice President George Bush as the Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush, the free marketeers fear, is not &quot;one of us.&quot;    &quot;There was hope on the part of a lot of us that there was another Reagan out there,&quot; says William Niskanen, a former economic adviser to the president and head of the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank here. &quot;But there isn't another Reagan.&quot;    Free-market advocates don't object to Mr. Bush's rhetoric. He sprinkles his speeches with calls for &quot;regulatory relief&quot; and the need to get government out of the marketplace. By contrast, Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, openly advocates a more active role for government.    Yet, conservatives complain, Mr. Bush has proposed new market interventions, such as ethanol subsidies, new tax breaks for child care, and college savings bonds. Perhaps more important, Mr. Bush has chosen as his closest friends and advisers two men who haven't demonstrated a thorough commitment to free-market ideology -- Nicholas Brady and James Baker.    Mr. Brady, a long-time Bush ally, was named earlier this week to succeed Mr. Baker as Treasury Secretary. His appointment is especially significant because Bush aides say Mr. Brady is likely to retain the post if the vice president is elected and becomes the top economic policy maker.    Mr. Brady, co-chairman of Dillon, Read andamp; Co., headed the presidential task force that studied last October's market crash. The task force won praise from many; but the free-market crowd was shocked by the report's call for a sweeping new scheme of financial market regulation -- &quot;circuit breakers&quot; to halt trading during periods of volatility, stiffer credit requirements in the futures markets, and overarching regulatory authority for the Federal Reserve.    The report convinced people like William Haraf of the American Enterprise Institute that Mr. Brady is &quot;not inclined toward a free-market view of the financial sector.&quot; Economist George Stigler, a mentor to many conservatives, agrees: &quot;He's a traditional Republican regulator.&quot;    Some top administration officials -- including White House Economic Adviser Beryl Sprinkel, Treasury Undersecretary George Gould and Budget Director James Miller -- also were surprised and disappointed by the Brady report's regulatory bent. (In a TV interview yesterday Mr. Bush endorsed the Brady report).    Free-market purists also have their doubts about the current Treasury Secretary, Mr. Baker, who is leaving his post to head up Mr. Bush's campaign, and who undoubtedly would play a major role in any Bush administration. Mr. Baker has alienated devotees of Adam Smith first by scuttling efforts to cut back regulation during his tenure as White House chief of staff, and then by largely ignoring banking deregulation as Treasury secretary.    &quot;Mr. Baker's reputation as a pragmatist is well deserved,&quot; says Mr. Haraf. &quot;He's not committed to a free-market approach. He hasn't pushed hard on financial deregulation.&quot; Mr. Niskanen says that in the first Reagan term, Mr. Baker quashed certain proposals to trim regulation because &quot;he felt they were political losers.&quot;    Mr. Baker also earned the enmity of many free-market economists by trying actively to influence the level of foreign exchange rates. And he raised free-market eyebrows again by advising the president to accept a trade bill viewed as dangerously protectionist by Mr. Sprinkel, Mr. Miller and others in the administration.    To be sure, Mr. Bush's advisers also include Stanford's Michael Boskin and Harvard's Martin Feldstein, two economists with acceptable conservative credentials. But neither of them has the same influence with the vice president as his close compatriots, Messrs. Brady and Baker.    Where does Mr. Bush stand on these issues? That's hard to say. Mr. Niskanen concludes that he shares a &quot;commitment&quot; to free-market values, &quot;but it is far short of zeal.&quot; The Task Force on Regulatory Relief Mr. Bush headed in the early Reagan years had &quot;almost no effect,&quot; he says. Much of this may reflect the Washington realities of deal-making and compromise. &quot;The great leveling force in Washington is the politics of pragmatism,&quot; says Securities and Exchange Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, once a firebrand free marketeer himself. &quot;You don't ask whether it is good or bad. You work with it.&quot;    Where does this leave free-market advocates? &quot;If Mr. Bush wins, most of the ideologues will go back to their academic and policy institute haunts and write op-ed pieces and books,&quot; says Mr. Niskanen. &quot;But if he loses, there will be a real catharsis in the broader conservative community. They will have to start looking for another Reagan.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
