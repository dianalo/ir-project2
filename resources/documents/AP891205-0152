The report by two scholars at the American Enterprise Institute,a think tank, suggested that more immigrants be ``pre-selected forspecific skills and occupations that are absent or in short supplyin this country.''   Currently, most immigrants are admitted because they have familymembers in the United States, according to authors Ben Wattenberg,a senior fellow, and Karl Zinsmeister, an adjunct fellow at theinstitute. Only 5 percent of immigrant visas now go to those withan occupational sikll.   The report said ``many researchers believe that America isentering an era of long-term labor shortage,'' and concluded thatimmigrants would go to regions and occupations where the demand wasgreatest.   Noting that ``thousands of talented persons'' want to leaveEastern Europe, the report said that it's ``an appropriate momentto sharply increase our acceptance of East European immigrants.''   ``We propose a program of `liberty visas _ 150,000 legal slotsper year for 10 years'' for those leaving Eastern Europe, thereport said.   Such people, the report added, have been ``doubly impeded''because the United States would not let them in without havingrelatives here and the communist states previously would not letthem out.</TEXT></DOC>
