<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-29-0664 </DOCNO><TEXT>A summary is presented of the reserves of natural gas in Alberta witha helium to natural gas ratio of l0.0010 or greater. The summary showsthat the gas reserves with the highest concentrations are in the FoxCreek, Peace River and Alderson (South Eastern Alberta) areas. It alsoshows the gas reserves and helium content in these higher helium concentrationspools which would be left in 1985 at the projected rates of production.1985 was considered the earliest date by which a helium recovery plantcould be completed if such a plant was found to be economically feasible.If all the gas with the higher helium concentrations in each of the areasdiscussed above could be collected and processed at a single plant, itis shown that there would be sufficient gas in each of the Fox Creekand Alderson areas to support a million cubic metres per year plant ata 60% recovery factor. An appendix presents a description and tabulationof the helium content of Alberta's raw gas at 31 December 1981, showingthat at the year-end Albert's remaining established natural gas reservescontained 931 million cubic metres of helium. 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
