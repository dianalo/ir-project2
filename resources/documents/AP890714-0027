After two years of legal review, Sheriff Mike Hennessey approveda plan that would authorize distribution of condoms to inmates inthree San Francisco jails.   The proposal, which had been scheduled to take effect today, hasbeen mired in legal uncertainty because engaging in sexual activityin jail is a felony in California. Any person who permits it couldbe charged with aiding and abetting illegal sexual activity,authorities said.   The city health commission is scheduled to review the programTuesday, Hayon said.   ``If the commission endorses it despite the legal ambiguities,we'll go for it,'' she said.   In a letter to Hennessey earlier this week, San FranciscoDistrict Attorney Arlo Smith said anyone who distributes condomswould be ``at particular risk of liability.''   Smith said circumstances that would influence the chance ofprosecution include the reasons for distribution, the number ofcondoms issued and evidence of sexual conduct.   Smith thinks it's impossible to issue a legal opinion coveringall situations and suggested Hennessey seek a change in the law.   Most of the nation's prison officials ban condoms, arguing thatdistribution would only encourage homosexual activity. But Vermont,Mississippi and New York City issue condoms to inmates.   Hennessey insisted the primary purpose of condom distribution wasto allow inmates to ``become familiar with the product withoutengaging in sexual activity.''   ``It's like driver's education,'' he said. ``You teach people todrive in a simulator.''   But he acknowledged sexual activity occurs in jails and saidinmates observed having sex would be booked and arrested.   ``If it is going to happen, we would prefer it happened with acondom so disease is not spread,'' he said.   Under the program, inmates would ask health educators forcondoms, which would be distributed one at a time if deemedmedically appropriate after an interview with the inmate, Hennesseysaid.   Condom distribution would be recorded in inmates' confidentialmedical records, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
