Not Shearson. In one of the securities industry's boldest and perhaps riskiest maneuvers, the aggressive firm now is moving to dethrone Merrill Lynch as the nation's top retail broker.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the descendant of a patchwork of securities firms that became a Wall Street powerhouse, has agreed to buy E.F. Hutton Group Inc. for close to $1 billion. The two firms reached tentative merger agreements twice in the past 24 hours, only to come across last-minute snags that finally were resolved late last night. By adding Hutton's more than 6,500 stockbrokers, Shearson is more than doubling the size of its sales force and building a powerful selling machine.    &quot;They're creating a real financial juggernaut,&quot; says Richard Jenrette, the chairman of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and its Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. securities unit.    Shearson is also taking a huge gamble on its ability to turn around an ailing firm -- as it has done successfully at least three times since its founding in 1960. The stock market's crash in October stunned many retail investors and scared them away from the market as the threat of another recession loomed larger. Thus, at a time when the number of retail brokers in the U.S. is at an all-time high, Shearson's newly enlarged sales force could find itself chasing a shrinking number of investors.    For Hutton, the agreement signals the end to what, until recently, had been one of Wall Street's most prestigious firms. &quot;This is really a shame for the Hutton franchise,&quot; says one senior investment banker close to the merger talks.    Hutton's days apparently have been numbered ever since its 1985 guilty plea to 2,000 federal counts of fraud in a now-infamous check-kiting scheme. That plea weakened customer and employee confidence in the firm, triggered a wholesale change of management and marked the first in a series of operating setbacks. Those setbacks, which disclosed weaknesses in financial controls, helped convince Hutton's directors that the firm could no longer go it alone.    Many of the problems now fall from the shoulders of Hutton's embattled chief executive, Robert Rittereiser, who is expected to resign, onto those of Shearson's intense chief, Peter A. Cohen. Among the problems Mr. Cohen must tackle immediately:    --How to ensure the loyalty of Hutton's best producers. Last week alone, about 80 retail brokers left the firm, one industry executive says. Shearson is expected to offer lucrative financial packages to Hutton employees it wants to retain.    --How to keep Hutton's computerized order-processing and customer-accounting operation running smoothly while many of the Hutton employees who staff it face almost certain layoffs. &quot;None of the employees know where they stand,&quot; a source close to Hutton says. &quot;They're more disturbed than ever.&quot;    --How to introduce Hutton's brokers to the much more cost-conscious world of Shearson, where brokers' commissions and autonomy are considerably lower.    --How to integrate Hutton's nearly 400 offices with about 350 of Shearson's. Many office consolidations are likely because of geographical overlaps.    --How to stem the almost certain drain of business from Hutton during the period of uncertainty while the two firms are being melded.    And these are just the problems that Mr. Cohen knows about. &quot;Whatever Peter thinks the problems are, they are twice as great -- they always are,&quot; says a senior official at another brokerage house.    Among the unknowns are legal liabilities that may have cropped up at Hutton in the past few years. For example, Shearson could inherit liability for any lawsuits brought by Hutton shareholders against Hutton officers and directors for rejecting a much higher, $1.65 billion offer for Hutton last November.    There are also heavy potential losses on Hutton's current inventory of stocks and bonds. An industry executive knowledgeable about Hutton's finances says the firm recently bought back from clients a large number of unit trusts that clients were unhappy with.    Because Hutton's sales force has been relatively loosely supervised over the past several years, some companies that had considered acquiring it worried about customer lawsuits over Hutton products. Just last year, Hutton took a $130 million charge against earnings after management discovered that some municipal bonds had been improperly marketed to customers. Mr. Rittereiser said the brochures used to sell the bonds incorrectly created the impression that they always would sell at par, with little risk to principal.    Nevertheless, Mr. Cohen also is inheriting one of the industry's most experienced and talented sales forces, plus one of its most lucrative money-management operations. &quot;We really were attracted to the E.F. Hutton account executives and branch managers,&quot; says Philip Purcell, the chief executive of Dean Witter Financial Services Group, the Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. unit that also coveted Hutton. &quot;We'd have worked very well together,&quot; Mr. Purcell says of Hutton.    Shearson, which since 1981 has been backed by the deep pockets of American Express Co., has wanted Hutton for more than a year. It was confident that its own cost-conscious management style and recently expanded computer capacity would yield major economies of scale and, eventually, big profits.    Over the past decade, improvements in the way computers track securities inventories and process customer orders and statements have reduced the number of people needed for such functions. Now, with high-powered computers installed by the likes of Shearson, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and PaineWebber Group Inc., the cost per trade is falling sharply. PaineWebber Chairman Donald Marron explains that &quot;to process double the amount of trades, you don't need anywhere near double the number of employees.&quot;    Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities-industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., says he was told by Shearson officials yesterday that they believe they can wring $400 million in annual costs out of Hutton's current operating budget. The Shearson officials added that only $200 million of costs will be excised next year because they believe that it will take about a half-year to eliminate many duplications at the firms.    If those numbers are correct, Mr. Eckenfelder says, the Hutton merger could be seen &quot;as one of the great deals of all time.&quot; He adds that Shearson's annual earnings could be improved by at least $100 million.    Although this bodes well for Shearson, it isn't good news for the hundreds of employees running Hutton's computer operations. One senior brokerage-firm executive says he would keep no more than 20% of the back-office staffers if his firm merged with Hutton.    Shearson also apparently doesn't need many of Hutton's hundreds of securities traders, nonretail salesmen and investment bankers. Another firm that looked seriously at Hutton says it planned to keep only about a third of Hutton's investment bankers. Hutton is considered weak in banking and trading, and Shearson is likely to keep only the best of the bunch.    At E.F. Hutton offices across the country, there was relief mixed with some anxiety over the future. &quot;The last few days it was like waiting for the baby to be born,&quot; says David P. McDuffee, a Hutton executive in Fayetteville, N.C. &quot;All week long, people have been reading in the paper about Hutton. That makes customers cautious. But now everybody's relieved. We're what Shearson wanted.&quot;    But in Provo, Utah, Hutton brokers anxiously eyed the local Shearson office and wondered which of the two offices might be eliminated. &quot;I don't know if there's relief here. It's more uncertainty,&quot; says James Nielson, a Hutton executive in Provo. &quot;You just have to wait and see, and nobody knows. . . . It would have been better if it was someone outside the business with deep pockets.&quot;    The acquisition marks the third straight triumph this year for Shearson's 41-year-old Mr. Cohen, a short, trim, sometimes aloof executive who is rarely far from a cigar and who prefers working on his yard to other, more sociable forms of recreation. He is often mistaken for the gardener by beachgoers stopping to admire the grounds of his Long Island estate.    Earlier this year, Mr. Cohen, who sometimes chafed under the American Express corporate umbrella, got his wish when the huge travel and credit-card company allowed Shearson to go public. At the same time, Shearson received a capital infusion of more than $500 million at favorable rates from Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Osaka, Japan. American Express, which had grown uncomfortable owning 100% of a firm in a capital-intensive business, is expected gradually to further cut its ownership stake -- now 60% -- in Shearson.    Although Mr. Cohen's new task appears to be his most daunting to date, colleagues note that he has been through this kind of thing before. Along with his equally intense, 45-year-old president, Jeffrey B. Lane, Mr. Cohen has participated in three successful major mergers in his more than 20 years at Shearson and forerunner companies. Both men had worked closely with one of Shearson's co-founders, Sanford I. Weill, as he built a small firm into the present-day Shearson Lehman.    Mr. Cohen played a key role in integrating into Shearson the dissension-ridden investment-banking firm of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, acquired in 1984. Unlike many Wall Street firms, Shearson long has been run like an industrial corporation, with well-defined management responsibilities.    &quot;I think they've done a terrific job in managing the business to this point,&quot; says Mr. Weill, who left the firm in 1985. Adds Equitable's Mr. Jenrette: &quot;I'm a real fan of Peter Cohen's.&quot;    While Mr. Cohen has increasingly turned his attention to international investment banking in the past few years, Mr. Lane has tended to problem-solving and cost-cutting. Mr. Lane is supervising a continuing round of layoffs that began in May, earlier than at most securities firms. He is known for attention to detail, such as poring over expense vouchers.    Shearson does have its own problems, however. During October, it lost $70 million, after taxes. And its improving investment-banking operation is still widely considered to lag behind those at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and First Boston Corp.    According to sources close to the talks, the events that led to the demise of E.F. Hutton began on an upbeat note at a Nov. 10 board meeting. Credit-rating agencies had visited and told Hutton that its rating wouldn't be changed. Mr. Rittereiser proudly announced that the firm had come through the October market crash &quot;exceptionally well.&quot;    Two days later, however, at least one rating agency called back and said it was going to take another look at Hutton's rating. A lower rating would significantly raise Hutton's borrowing costs; thus, its management conducted a telephone board meeting at which it suggested that a partner be sought. The board designated Peter Ueberroth, the baseball commissioner and a Hutton director, to work with Hutton management and the firm's investment advisers, Salomon Brothers Inc. and Blackstone Group, to seek a partner or major infusion of cash.    Ironically, it was Mr. Weill, Shearson's former chairman and now the chairman of Commercial Credit Co., who first approached Hutton. But Hutton concluded that Commercial Credit, a Baltimore-based financial-services concern, wasn't a big enough partner. Partly because of Hutton's fear that Mr. Weill's interest would leak out, Hutton on Nov. 23 announced that it was seeking more capital.    The five firms expressing the strongest interest were Shearson, Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, Equitable and Transamerica Corp. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, Hutton's advisers told the parties to submit bids by noon last Tuesday.    But the firms balked at entering a bidding war. By Monday, Hutton's investment bankers decided to call off the auction. Meetings were conducted with the chief executives of all the firms, and Hutton decided to negotiate first with Shearson. Some Hutton directors and Blackstone Group disliked that choice, but everyone eventually agreed to proceed.    Negotiations with Shearson began Tuesday morning. Mr. Ueberroth agreed to keep Hutton's second choice, Dean Witter, posted on developments. If a deal hadn't been struck Tuesday, negotiations would have begun with Dean Witter. Merrill Lynch, which had expressed considerable reluctance about the whole process, was third in line, followed by Equitable.    By about 9 p.m., the Hutton board had agreed with Shearson on a merger. It was impressed mainly by a presentation by Shearson's Mr. Cohen, who talked of his grand vision for the combined firm's future as a major international securities operation and of the high-income retail clients that it would seek. Shearson and Hutton officials, board members and investment bankers drank champagne and toasted the new alliance. The lawyers worked all night drafting an agreement.    However, a snag developed yesterday morning involving the preferred stock Shearson was offering to Hutton shareholders. Shearson already has issued preferred stock to Nippon Life, and arguments developed over which preferred shares would be considered senior. A revised agreement was reached late yesterday afternoon, substituting a senior subordinated debenture for the preferred stock being offered to Hutton shareholders. Mr. Rittereiser then got on Hutton's intercom system to announce the sale of the firm.    But negotiations continued, as Shearson raised a tax problem. A final deal was signed late last night, giving each Hutton shareholder $25 in cash and the debenture with a market value of $4.25.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Hutton's stock closed down 25 cents at $27.375 a share, while Shearson closed at $15, up 50 cents.    ---   Bryan Burrough contributed to this article.    ---                    The Largest Brokers   Ranked by total capital at Sept. 30, 1987; in billions ofdollars Merrill Lynch ................................ $8.0 Shearson Lehman/E.F.
