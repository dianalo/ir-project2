In particular the CONT group followed closelythe code development and validation (COVA) programme carried out at theJRC Ispra. This activity also included an assessment of related materialprogrammes. From a comparison of containment codes and a sensitivityanalysis, it was concluded that the codes developed in the EC MemberStates and at the JRC Ispra allow to treat the consequences of a hypotheticalcore-disruptive accident on primary containment with adequate accuracy.Consequently the the group considered its mandate fulfilled and terminatedits activities.</TEXT></DOC>
