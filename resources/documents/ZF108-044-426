 In fact,this draft of the structured query language will address far more importantcomponents than did the first SQL standard.andM;And it proposes rules for an incredible array of new features, some of whichhave never been implemented.andM;The draft is so rich that some industry observers predict that it could be asmany as seven years before even the first complaint DBMS publisher comesfully in line with the final standard.andM;Of course, the availability of a standard doesn't mean that all publishersare going to become complainant, or that those who choose to will followalong anytime soon.andP;  However, most DBMS publishers are likely to strive forat least partial compliance in the near term.andM;Three levels of complianceandM;While timing vendors' total adoption of SQL2 is tricky, it is much easier topredict which features are most likely to be available across products first.andM;The current draft proposes three levels of compliance: Entry, Intermediateand Full.andP;  And while nothing is final (even after it's &quot;final&quot;), the industrycommitment is strong enough on the features and functions of Entry Level SQL2that the major players are already devoting development resources to bringtheir offerings into line.andM;As it stands, the proposal for Entry Level compliance includes all of thefirst SQL standard from 1986, along with the integrity-enhancement featuresof last year's X3.135-1989 addendum plus a few minor additional features.andO;The three most significant new features of the proposed Entry Level SQL2 aresupport for referential integrity, default values and check clauses, all fromthe addendum.andM;The Intermediate Level involves some more elaborate features.andP;  Included, saysindustry consultant and X3H2 committee member Joe Celko of Los Angeles, aresupport for &quot;extended set operations on tables--like intersects and setdifference (the except statement)--and the ability to use join operators inthe 'form' clause.&quot;andP;  Full compliance, he continues, &quot;includes some of thevery fancy stuff.&quot;andP;  Those features may be years away.andM;References match keysandM;Database-enforced referential integrity bids to be the most significant newEntry Level feature for most developers.andP;  Simply, referential integrityinvolves making certain that any database object that references anotherdatabase object must be valid.andP;  For instance, if the developer defines aforeign key in a table, it is necessary that the table contain a primary keyof the same value as the foreign key; if it doesn't, the database does nothave referential integrity.andM;In the past, few implementations supported referential integrity at thedatabase level.andP;  Unify has provided support for years through its schemacreation and maintenance utilities.andP;  And more recently, Sybase providedintegrity enforcement through a type of stored procedure called a trigger.andO;Other DBMS products required developers to write application code to enforcereferential integrity.andM;Over the coming months, most of the major DBMS vendors will be providing thistype of support in an effort to comply with the 1989 addendum and the EntryLevel standard proposal regarding referential integrity.andP;  Informix istargeting late 1990 for a release that will include support for referentialintegrity both in the ANSI SQL format and, probably in a more limited way,through an easy user interface tool.andP;  Oracle also plants to make referentialintegrity a part of its upcoming Version 7.andM;However, including referential integrity enforcement can adversely impactapplications, as Unify DBMS source code licensee, Digital Analysis Corp. ofReston, Va., learned early on.andP;  At update and add time, checking forreferential integrity--just like updating an index--usually adds at least oneextra disk access for each transaction, slowing processing.andP;  This led DigitalAnalysis to develop in 1986 a bulk-load utility, based on Unify's &quot;dbload&quot;command, but which bypasses any referential integrity checking step, greatlyimproving performance.andP;  This type of utility is especially valuable for usewith data sets known to not violate integrity rules (as might be the case indata-conversion operations).andM;Oracle plans a similar functionality for Version 7.andP;  Oracle director of RDBMSmarketing, Ken Jacobs, says the new product will enable databaseadministrators to turn referential integrity enforcement off and on asneeded.andP;  Jacobs cautions, however, that, when the user turns a constraintback on the product will perform a check to see if the constraint is valid,before enforcement is permitted.andM;More good newsandM;Of the other key components proposed for Entry Level SQL2, default supportsimply allows the application developer to specify default values for fieldsin a table when no value is specified on insert.andP;  Check-clause support ismore involved.andM;Check constraints permit the database administrator to perform domainenforcement.andP;  As Informix product manager Tim Shetler says, &quot;Maybe you do notwant to allow some field to have a value greater than 10,000.andP;  Or maybe onlya particular list of values is permissible, such as the abbreviations for allthe states.&quot;andP;  In such cases, domain enforcement is valuable.andM;Also on the horizon, but more likely to be part of Intermediate Levelcompliance requirements, are a wide range of new data types.andP;  These includecharacter varying, or varying the length of text fields, and the binarylarge-object data type, or &quot;blob&quot;--as some practitioners refer to it.andP;  Alsorecently added to the draft is a specification for a varying-bit data type.andM;Other data types include &quot;datetime&quot; and &quot;interval.&quot;andP;  Datetime describes aspecific point in time, including the year, month, day, hour, minute, secondand fractions of a second.andP;  Precision is such, contends Informix's Shetler,that, &quot;With today's processor speeds, you're almost guaranteed that you'renot going to have two things hitting at the exact same datetime.&quot;andP;  Intervalfields store a span of time between two datetimes.andM;While the standards process plugs along, change within it is constant.andO;Informix standards manager, Paul Perkovic, represents Informix on the ANSIcommittee.andP;  Says Perkovic, &quot;We alredy have datetime support, but not with theexact syntax that's used in the SQL2 draft.andP;  One of the problems is that theSQL2 working draft changes every two months--when we have one of our ANSIcommittee meetings.&quot;andM;He concludes, &quot;A vendor trying to implement a feature it expects will be partof the SQL2 standard is running the risk that, even if you implement what'sin a working draft today, it may have changed by the time it's adopted.&quot;andM;Oracle has had such experiences.andP;  Jacobs asserts, &quot;Oracle has a 'date' datatype--which is new in SQL2.andP;  Our date data type goes back to the early '80s.andO;There are a lot of applications built with it, and the functionality isdifferent from the functionality in the standard.&quot;andM;Jacobs takes a firm stand on the issue.andP;  He asserts: &quot;Clearly we will have tocontinue to provide the functionality that we provide now, because we havemany, many thousand of customes who have built applications using thatfunctionality.andM;While developers are understandably anxious to use the new languageconstructs as soon as DBMS publishers include them in products, caution isadvised.andP;  New versions of ANSI language standards are very likely to becompatible with old versions, but there are no guarantees they will becompatible with versions published by vendors before the standard becomesofficial.andM;There are basically two kinds of incompatibilities that prove troublesome.andO;In the easier of the two situations, the standard comes out with a keyworddifferent than the keyword the vendor adopted for the same purpose.andP;  Whenthis happens, the vendor can support both functions in itsproducts--providing ANSI compatibility and an upward migration path fordeveloper customers who have earlier versions.andM;The second situation is harder to deal with.andP;  Here, the standards committeeadopts a new language command that has the same name as a command the DBMSvendor has already begun to support.andP;  The problem is that the new standardcommand works differently than the command implemented in the publisher'scurrent releases.andM;In this case, the publisher has a difficult decision.andP;  First, it can go aheadand adopt the new standard for future versions of the product, leavingmigration to the new product difficult for purchasers of the old product.andO;(Migration would mean recording--perhaps even redesigning--the oldapplication to make it compatible with future versions of the DBMS software.)andO;Or, the DBMS publisher can ignore this aspect of the new standard, continuingto support the existing client base at the risk of alienating new customers.andM;To keep the migration path open, where possible, developers should do twothings.andP;  First, they avoid basing the design of a software module on acommand not already part of a standard.andP;  Second, they avoid extensive use ofa command that is not yet a standard, especially when the committee isconsidering a new command with the same name.andP;  While adhering to theseguidelines is difficult at present (given the limited nature of existingstandards), when SQL2 is released it may prevent unnecessary irritation onwhatever distant day the SQL3 standard is released.andM;Ron Carnahan is a senior management consultant with JYACC Inc., a New YorkCity company providing management and technical consulting services as wellas a line of application development tools.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
