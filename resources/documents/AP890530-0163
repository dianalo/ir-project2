The May 22 meeting came as Jibril's radical group, the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, reneweddenials it was involved in the Pan Am bombing Dec. 21 that killed270 people.   U.S. and other Western intelligence officials believe thePopular Front carried out the bombing at Iran's request inretaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iran Air jetlinerlast July in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard died.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Velayatiand Jibril discussed Iran's support for the Palestinian struggleagainst Israel.   They said Jibril asserted that armed struggle was the only waythe Palestinians will regain their homeland.   Like Jibril and other Syrian-backed Palestinian leaders, Iranhas denounced PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's peace initiative,renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel.   The sources said Velayati was in Damascus, the Syrian capital,for consultations with President Hafez Assad before last week'sArab summit conference, which endorsed Arafat's initiative andsought ways to end the Lebanese civil war.   Jibril denies involvement in the Pan Am bombing. But he has saidhis group makes bombs similar to the one investigators believedexploded in the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland on a flight fromFrankfurt via London to New York.   Iran also denies involvement.   Popular Front spokesman Fahd Shrourou said on May 21 in Damascusin decrying U.S. allegations: ``We're not agents for Iran or anyoneelse. They didn't ask us. They're not allowed to ask us for suchthings.''   He said that ``American insistence on blaming us is becausethey've failed to get any evidence'' firmly linking his group withthe Pan Am bombing.   Diplomats and counterterrorism specialists believe Jibril andPalestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal forged new links overthe last year with Iranian radicals and their Shiite Moslem alliesin Lebanon.   The radical resurgence in Tehran; the confrontation with theWest over British author Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The SatanicVerses,'' which many Moslem say blasphemes Islam, and opposition byhard-line Palestinian factions to Arafat's initiative by thePalestine Liberation Organization would provide fertile ground forsuch an alliance.   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani asked Palestiniansthis month to kill five Westerners for every Palestinian slain byIsraelis in the uprising in the occupied territories and to attackWestern targets.   He later claimed he was misinterpreted. But his remarks wereseen as reflecting the militancy of radicals now ascendant inTehran.   The diplomatic sources said evidence against the the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the Pan Amsabotage ``is circumstantial, but it's there.''   They cited the arrest of 14 Popular Front activists in WestGermany last October, including a top Jibril lieutenant, KassemDalkamoni.   The men had Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosives hidden in acandy wrapper and a bomb hidden in a Japanese-made cassette radiolinked to a barometric device.   Investigators have concluded the Pan Am bomb contained Semtex,was hidden in a cassette radio packed in a suitcase and wastriggered by a barometric sensor.   Popular Front officials said the men arrested in West Germanywere heading for the Middle East to attack Israeli targets.   Shrourou said: ``We don't carry out attacks in Europe becausethat would have a negative effect on the support of the EEC(European Economic Community) nations for the Palestinianstruggle.''   However, Western European governments have generally supportedArafat's efforts to negotiate a settlement with Israel, a moveJibril and his fellow radicals consider a betrayal of thePalestinian cause.   Diplomats and counterterrorism specialists doubt the PopularFront's claim it would not hit targets in Europe.   Police in Sweden last week arraigned three men they said werelinked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand for suspected complicity in the 1985 bombing of a Danishsynagogue and similar attacks on U.S. and Israeli airline officesin Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
