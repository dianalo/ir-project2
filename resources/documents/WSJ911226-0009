Protecting those carefully manicured, frightfully longfingernails, she is, at that moment, the Streisand you wantto love: Brash, funny, a little ridiculous maybe, butendearing.</LP><TEXT>   But Ms. Streisand in recent years has decided that itisn't enough to possess one of the world's most originalvoices and original personalities. Like many talented peopleshe undermines her own gifts, thinking something else must bebetter. Oddly, the something else she settled on was PatConroy's melodramatic bestselling novel about theentanglement between a Southern Gothic family called theWingos and a New York Jewish psychiatrist called SusanLowenstein.   The choice of the material itself wasn't odd. Mr. Conroy'semotional story is full of high-blown emotion and a deepsentimentality not hidden at all by a veneer of coy cynicism.The novel's vividly manipulative plot and style must haveappealed enormously to Ms. Streisand, never a performer toshy away from emotional display.   But she chose not only to direct, but to cast herself asLowenstein the psychiatrist, whose main duty throughout thefilm is to react to Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), as he sits on hercouch and tells his family's story. (Tom flew to New York tomeet Lowenstein after his sister, Lowenstein's patient,attempted suicide.) Lowenstein is a refined woman who speaksimmaculate French, wears trim, expensive suits and keeps herthoughts to herself. She is (except for those nails) theparvenu's idea of &quot;real&quot; elegance.   Ms. Streisand looks uncomfortable sitting there inLowenstein's neat black suit, hmm-hmmming as Wingo'sincredible story unfolds through a series of flashbacks.Apparently not knowing what else to do, she falls back on afamiliar pose, the earnest look that frequently appears onthe faces of famous people when they are accepting or givingawards.   Her restrained performance is out of place in thisscenario, which thrives on excess. Mr. Conroy's story (healso co-authored the screenplay) overflows with psychologicaland dramatic hyperbole. The Wingo family is subject to somuch internal turmoil and external horror it could fillseveral seasons of a daily soap opera. (This is the kind ofstory where psychiatry works magic; a secret is told and,voila] Patient is cured).   As director, Ms. Streisand does her best work when sheisn't directing herself. The flashbacks have a nicemelodramatic flourish (though they, like almost everythingelse in the picture, are almost drowned out by the loud wailsand moans of James Newton Howard's overwhelming score).   But the movie concentrates on the relationship between TomWingo and Lowenstein. That's fair enough. His marriage is introuble, the sister he loves is lying comatose in thehospital -- why wouldn't he fall for the attractivepsychiatrist who's helping him uncover the dark secretsthat's making him and his family so miserable? Nick Nolte isquite good as the selfindulgent, self-pitying Tom Wingo, aman who deals with the past by forgetting it, or mocking it.(After he's &quot;cured&quot; he becomes something far worse, a smugNew Age man.)   Ms. Streisand has decided to cast their relationship interms a writer of greeting cards might find meaningful.&quot;There's nothing sexier than a beautiful woman ordering foodin French,&quot; coos Mr. Nolte, when he and Lowenstein havedinner together. Rejecting all that is uniquely attractiveabout her, Ms. Streisand has styled Lowenstein as a tony sexobject, the bimbo shrink. The camera returns over and over toher slim legs and silky neck and voluptuous bust. And, ofcourse, her long, perfect nails. st   Lawrence (&quot;The Big Chill&quot;) Kasdan's new film &quot;GrandCanyon,&quot; is sort of a contemporary &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot;the story of six citizens of Los Angeles trying to find somereason to live.   They have much reason to despair, in Mr. Kasdan's sadvision of his city. He paints a sorrowful portrait of a LosAngeles overcome by violence, its people awash in self-pityand immobility. His characters include a disillusionedimmigration lawyer (Kevin Kline), a tow truck driver (DannyGlover) whose sister and her children are trapped in theblack ghetto, and a shallow Hollywood producer (SteveMartin). All three give strong, intuitive performances.   Mr. Kasdan, who wrote the screenplay with his wife Meg,touches on many of the problems and fears of modern life withan astute, if heavy hand. Too often the film languishes asMr. Kasdan poses Big Questions and then has his charactersanswer them in conversations that are so casual they seemimprovised. Yet once in awhile some poetry emerges.   ---   VIDEO TIP: There was a time when Streisand was willing tobe Streisand, in all her outrageous, vulgar glory. Take alook at her in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (skip &quot;Funny Lady&quot;), &quot;The Way WeWere,&quot; &quot;What's Up Doc&quot; and even &quot;Yentl,&quot; the other movie shedirected.</TEXT></DOC>
