The workbook will develop an investment decision-makingexercise that current managers can perform to determine the feasibilityof biomass energy usage for their particular situations. This guide willbe applicable to companies considering initial installation of an energysystem, retrofitting a conventional system to accommodate biomass fuels,and the replacement of an existing fossil-fueled boiler with one thatburns biomass. Additionally, this workbook will examine the feasibilityof a biomass-fueled steam/electricity cogeneration facility as a newinstallation option for small-to-medium-sized firms. The workbook entitledBiomass Energy Systems: An Investment Decision-Making Guide for the SmallBusiness, is currently being prepared for field testing. Input from thebusiness education editor should provide useful insight as to the readabilityand ease of use by the intended audience. A complementary manual entitledResource Manual of Financing Options for Biomass-Fueled Systems discussesfinancial options available for investors in biomass energy systems.</TEXT></DOC>
