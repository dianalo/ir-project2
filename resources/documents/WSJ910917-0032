Philippine officials said the text, timing andconstitutionality of the proposed referendum seemed uncertainyesterday as the Philippine Senate voted 12-11 to reject atreaty that would have allowed U.S. forces to extend theiruse of Subic Bay Naval Base for 10 years.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials said troops weren't leaving the Philippinesyet, despite previous pledges to begin a withdrawal if theSenate rejected the treaty. U.S. Embassy spokesman StanleySchrager said Washington supports Mrs. Aquino's effort topush ahead with efforts to salvage the treaty. &quot;We admire herdetermination and warmly reciprocate her support for thefriendship between our two countries,&quot; he said. Mrs. Aquinoannounced the referendum plan Sunday.   But Western diplomats said U.S. officials were urging thePhilippines to clarify the legal status of the 8,000 U.S.troops stationed in the country. The Senate's rejection ofthe treaty meant the troops' presence in the country afterlast night violated the Philippine constitution.   Although the Senate rejection had been expected for morethan a week, observers said Mrs. Aquino's administrationappeared woefully unprepared for it. For a referendum tooccur, a petition calling for one must be signed by 12% ofthe country's electorate, including 3% of voters in eachlegislative district. Though a petition backed by thepresident could easily garner the 3.6 million signaturesneeded, the process would take weeks and cost about $11million.   Officials said Mrs. Aquino is seeking a Decemberreferendum declaring that the Philippine people reject theSenate's decision and calling on the lawmakers to reconsiderit. Even though legal experts said such a petition wouldn'tbe legally binding upon the Senate, some anti-treaty senatorshave said they would challenge any pro-treaty referendum incourt.   The Philippine Supreme Court has ruled against Mrs.Aquino's administration in several recent cases and last weekrefused to block the Senate vote on the treaty. A courtdecision on the referendum could be issued in a few days, orit could take months.   Officials said that if the court halts the referendum, theAquino administration will attempt a second referendum toamend the constitution itself, abolishing the Senate's powerto block the treaty.   Legal experts said this second referendum would raisefewer constitutional issues. But it couldn't be held untilFeb. 2, 1992, when the constitution will have been in effectfor five years.   Nonetheless, the delay raises legal problems. Under theconstitution, all U.S. troops should have left thePhilippines when the 1947 military bases agreement expiredlast night without a treaty to take its place. U.S. officialssay the constitution and a May 1990 notice from Manilaterminating the previous bases agreement violate thatagreement, which says that notice to terminate can be givenonly after the pact has expired. The 1947 agreement gives theU.S. one year after notice of termination to withdraw itstroops.   Raul Rabe, spokesman for the Philippine negotiating panelduring the talks that led to the treaty, said the Philippineswould act today &quot;to place things on a legal plane&quot; in a waythat would permit the U.S. troops to remain.</TEXT></DOC>
