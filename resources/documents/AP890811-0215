Some expect the airline company's management to come throughwith its own takeover bid that would include the participation ofemployees of United Airlines, UAL's biggest subsidiary.   But Davis met with UAL representatives Thursday night at anairport in New York to discuss terms of the $240-a-share proposalfor the first time, The New York Times reported in today's editions.   The newspaper, quoting people familiar with the offer, saidDavis was telephoned by UAL representatives about the board'sdecision Wednesday to explore ``all possible financial andstrategic alternatives'' for its future.   The newspaper said Davis did not expect UAL to be receptive tothe offer. Davis and one of his key advisers in the deal held aseries of meetings to prepare their presentatiion to UAL Thursdaynight.   The newspaper provided no other details of the meeting in NewYork.   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said he could not comment on thereport.   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. inNew York, said Davis' offer was at the low end of an acceptable bidfor UAL, which he estimated could fetch $300 a share, or $6.75billion.   A leveraged buyout by management is emerging as the most popularscenario among industry observers in the wake of UAL's announcementWednesday.   Analysts said UAL's management, employees and the company'slargest shareholder, financier Saul Steinberg, might join forces ina leveraged buyout.   In a leveraged buyout, a management group buys a company mainlywith borrowed money, which it usually pays back by selling some ofthe company's assets or with its cash flows.   Steinberg, whose Reliance Group Holdings Inc. has a 6.9 percentstake in the company, is a longtime business associate and friendof UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.   UAL's long-running labor disputes with its pilots and flightattendants _ the pilots have been without a contract for nearly 1{years, the flight attendants for about two years _ could provide anincentive for management to invite employees to join forces in abuyout.   ``That might be a feature of a labor settlement,'' said analystRobert Decker of Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``It would be a wayfor Mr. Wolf to aproach his unions and give them a stake in thecompany with financial benefits, as well as a way of increasingemployee loyalty.''   Sara Dornacker, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based UAL, said shecould not comment on the possibility of a management takeover.   The United pilots, who made their own buyout offer nearly twoyears ago, have asked their financial and legal advisers to studythe situation, said their spokeswoman Kathie Hardin.   Leaders of United's flight attendants union local were out oftown and not immediately available for comment.   UAL's stock rose $7.25 to $251.12{ a share Thursday on the NewYork Stock Exchange, reflecting speculation that richer proposalswould emerge. The stock ended last week at $164.50 a share.   Pan Am Corp., which has been seeking a merger partner, isinterested in bidding for UAL, according to its chairman, Thomas G.Plaskett. The financially weak airline company unsuccessfullyproposed a merger earlier this year with NWA Inc., parent ofNorthwest Airlines.   Another potential bidder, analysts said, is the powerful NewYork investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., which, likeDavis and Pan Am, bid unsuccessfully for NWA earlier this year. NWAeventually was purchased by an investor group led by Alfred Checchi.</TEXT></DOC>
