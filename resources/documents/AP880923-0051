Troopers fired tear gas to drive the protesters back.   About 500 students, shouting ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics!''attempted to march out of Korea University in eastern Seoul andwere blocked by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatiguesand black-visored helmets.   Students hurled firebombs and rocks at the police, who used teargas and hurled back rocks during the half-hour clash.   It appeared to be the first time riot police had used tear gasin Seoul since the Olympics began Saturday. The government bannedtear gas in an effort to limit limit anti-government protests.   No one was reported arrested or injured in the clash, which wasconfined to the main gate in front of the school, about 15 milesfrom the main Olympic venues.   Radicals have staged a number of protests against the Olympics,but they have been small and largely peaceful. Most Koreans arecritical of the protests and want the Games, which end Oct. 2, tobe a success.   During the earlier campus rally, student leaders denounced theSouth Korean government for not sharing the Olympics with communistNorth Korea. They also claimed the government would use the Gamesto cement authoritarian rule.   Speakers said the Games were being used by the Seoul governmentto perpetuate the division of the Korean Peninsula. The Games, theysaid, should be shared to help reunite the two Koreas.   Protesters also demanded the release of a student leaderarrested by police Thusday for organzing anti-government protestsin recent months.   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to bea co-host was rejected by the International Olympic Committee,which said the Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot beshared.
