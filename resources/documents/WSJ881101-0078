Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><DATELINE> HONOLULU  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the thrift industry's biggest trade group struck a defiant note in opening the group's annual convention, saying the industry shouldn't be tapped for any additional funds to bail out its insolvent deposit insurer.    Theo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said that if the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.'s current borrowing authority of $10.8 billion proves insufficient to handle failed thrifts, &quot;new sources of funds must be found.&quot;    &quot;Any amount beyond the $10.8 billion would stretch our institutions to the limits of prudence,&quot; Mr. Pitt said. The nation's 3,100 FSLIC-insured thrifts must pay the interest costs of the $10.8 billion in FSLIC borrowing.    Mr. Pitt didn't say where the additional funds should be found. Most independent economists and analysts, and a few members of Congress, have said the FSLIC will require a bailout with taxpayer funds of $20 billion to $50 billion or more. Several lawmakers have said the savings-and-loan industry should be required to pay some part of the FSLIC bailout cost and accept tighter regulation in return for government help.    Mr. Pitt also said the industry group will soon propose changes in the deposit-insurance system for thrifts. League members were scheduled to discuss the proposals, which aren't in final form, in a closed session yesterday.    Various competing trade groups and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are also expected to make their own proposals after Election Day to overhaul the deposit-insurance system for both banks and thrifts.    L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, in his speech compared the problems of the deposit-insurance system to the state of the Navy after Pearl Harbor. He noted that within a year of the attack, 90% of the damaged ships had been &quot;raised, refitted and were back in action.&quot;    &quot;America's banks and thrifts can meet that challenge ahead in the same way. We need to raise and refit our deposit-insurance funds,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.    In a news conference later, asked about proposals to merge the FSLIC and the FDIC, Mr. Seidman said he prefers that the FDIC remain separate. However, he said, &quot;we are certainly willing to look at any alternatives.&quot; He repeated previous statements that any merger of the funds shouldn't force commercial banks to pay for the cost of bailing out the FSLIC.    Mr. Seidman said it will be hard for Congress to fix the problems in the deposit-insurance system if the various bank and thrift industry groups and the new administration can't agree on a single proposal.    He forecast that the FDIC will post an operating profit of about $500 million next year, after an operating loss this year estimated at about $2 billion. He said the FDIC expects to handle 150 to 175 failed banks next year, down from an expected record of more than 200 this year. The agency's list of &quot;problem banks&quot; that are weak and might fail is down to 1,434 from its high of 1,624 in June 1987, he said. In addition, the FDIC doesn't expect any &quot;megabanks&quot; to fail next year, unlike this year, when several large Texas banks failed.    &quot;As of today, we don't anticipate having to handle any banks with more than $3 billion in assets next year,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.    Because of the deepening financial crisis at the FSLIC and in certain parts of the thrift industry, Mr. Pitt and other league officials were defensive about holding the group's convention a few hundred yards from Waikiki beach.    &quot;This is an important meeting,&quot; Mr. Pitt said at the opening of his news conference, adding that &quot;these (sessions) are going to be focused on educational topics.&quot; He said the meeting site was chosen four years ago. &quot;It probably would have been impossible to book another city on such short notice,&quot; he said.    Two network television crews were barred from filming the league's opening cocktail reception, which featured Hawaiian dancers. A league spokesman said camera crews are barred from all &quot;social events&quot; as a matter of policy.    Mr. Pitt said the league's proposal on deposit-insurance overhaul will encompass a number of reforms, mostly involving tighter regulation, that are designed to make sure that &quot;never again will a situation of the severity and magnitude of the FSLIC crisis be allowed to reoccur.&quot;    Mr. Pitt said the league believes that the Sandamp;L industry's separate regulatory structure, including the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which provides low-cost long-term credit to thrifts, must be maintained to preserve the role of Sandamp;Ls as specialized mortgage lenders.    U.S. Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, former chairman of the nation's sixth-largest thrift, suggested in a speech that the deposit-insurance funds should be replaced with a direct guarantee of bank and thrift deposits by the U.S. Treasury. Mr. Frank also suggested establishing a receivership agency for the assets of failed thrifts in Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
