In thatdecision it was found that, among other things, it is appropriate for theMaritime Administration to establish guidelines on the acceptable levelof domestic carriage for operators of vessels built with the aid of construction-differentialsubsidy (CDS) when engaged on a voyage in foreign trade on which such vesselmay stop at the state of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territoryof the United States under section 506 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936,as amended (Act).Interested persons are invited to submit comments on such acceptable level.Comments particularly would be helpful on whether that level should be:(1) A set percentage of foreign to total carriage by cargo (TEU or tonnage)or freight revenue; (2) a set TEU or tonnage level of foreign carriage;(3) a threshold percentage of domestic carriage with greater carriage permittedbased on establishment of certain facts, and the nature of the facts tobe considered; (4) measured on a voyage or annual basis for a CDS-builtvessel or on the basis of all CDS-built vessles on a service; (5) a narrativestandard; or (6) some other measure.Interested persons are also invited to submit comments on the procedureby which the acceptable level is to be implemented: (1) Policy guidelinesstatement; (2) general rulemaking; (3) <T3>ad hoc </T3>determination; or (4) some other means.The goal of the Maritime Administration in this matter is to establishguidelines that are minimally intrusive and as self-executing as possible,consistent with the concerns of Congress under the Act. The owners andoperators of CDS-built vessels need to know the scope of operations whichwill not jeopardize or breach their CDS contracts. The Jones Act vesseloperators and owners need to know such scope so that they can make reasonablebusiness decisions on their operations.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 20.800 Construction-DifferentialSubsidies (CDS))</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Maritime Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
