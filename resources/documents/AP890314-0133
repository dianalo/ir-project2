(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge today denied asylum in New Yorkto a fugitive Indian activist and ordered him sent back to NorthCarolina to face kidnapping charges in a 1988 armed takeover of anewspaper office.   Lawyers for Timothy Jacobs filed an appeal even before the rulingwas issued, meaning he will remain in New York while the legalbattle continues.   Defense attorney Lewis Pitts had argued that Jacobs' life was indanger in North Carolina because of his knowledge of corruptionthere.   But Madison County Judge William O'Brien II told Jacobs: ``You'vespent the entire time here with the same information about drugtrafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm to you or anythreats to you.''   The judge revoked Jacobs' $25,000 bail, and the 20-year-oldTuscarora Indian was taken away to jail.   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin has asked New York to returnJacobs so he can be tried in the takeover of The Robesoniannewspaper in Lumberton, N.C.   Jacobs and fellow Tuscarora Eddie Hatcher, 31, both of Pembroke,N.C., used shotguns to hold 20 people hostage for 10 hours beforesurrendering. Hatcher and Jacobs said they were trying to publicizeallegations of corruption.   The siege ended when Martin agreed to investigate their chargesthat county officials were involved in drug dealing and murder. Atask force found no evidence to support the claims, which Martinlater said were based on ``rumor and gossip.''   A federal jury acquitted Jacobs and Hatcher of hostage-takingcharges in October, but they were indicted by a Robeson County grandjury in December.   Jacobs fled North Carolina befoe he could be arrested and triedto take refuge at the Onondaga Indian reservation near Syracuse.   Hatcher had fled to Idaho but was arrested Friday by the FBIafter attempting to seek refuge at the Soviet consulate in SanFrancisco.</TEXT></DOC>
