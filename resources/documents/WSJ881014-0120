Intel rose 1/2 to 25 1/4, while MCI Communications gained 1/2 to 20 1/8. Rumors about another technology issue, Ashton-Tate, prompted hectic trading and raised its price 2 1/4 to 25; almost 600,000 AshtonTate shares changed hands.    The Nasdaq composite index, which fell nearly three points Wednesday in anticipation of bad news on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, rose 0.91 to finish at 383.46. The trade gap did widen as expected, to $12.18 billion in August from $9.47 billion in July.    Although the upturn in the index was small, traders said it may be the start of something bigger. &quot;The institutions are starting to commit money to the technology stocks,&quot; said Robert O'Toole Sr., manager of institutional OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;It was a fun day. I think we're out of the woods.&quot;    But John D'Angelo, who heads the OTC desk at Baird Patrick andamp; Co., was less enthusiastic, attributing the technology stocks' popularity to bargain-hunting. &quot;The stocks have been hammered so badly lately that people think they're reasonably priced now,&quot; he said.    Trading was light, as 112.4 million shares changed hands. Declining issues outpaced advancers by 1,020 to 932.    Among technology stocks, Ashton-Tate's 10% gain was the biggest. Rumors of an improvement in the outlook for shipments of the company's dBase IV software package sent traders scrambling for shares. The stock was battered last month after several analysts warned that the computer software company might miss its shipping targets.    An Ashton-Tate spokesman said the company has &quot;nothing specific to report&quot; about the software package.    Several other technology stocks also rebounded from sharp falls Wednesday. Sun Microsystems rose 1 3/4 to 30 on volume of 1.2 million shares. Apple Computer closed up 1/4 at 39. But smaller issues, such as Sigma Designs, Dallas Semiconductor and Miniscribe, were all down in active trading.    The action in technology issues aside, acquisition activity and earnings news provided most of the day's drama.    The day's biggest gainer, GardenAmerica, surged 8 to 27 1/2 after Emhart said it agreed to acquire the heating and cooling equipment maker for $84 million, or $28.13 a share.    Molokai Ranch, which disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it agreed in principle to be acquired by Industrial Equity (Pacific) for $55 a share, closed at 55 bid, up 7. The real estate development company had rejected an offer from Industrial Equity that was $10 a share lower.    News of an $8.63-a-share merger proposal for MNX drove shares of the trucking company higher. It closed at 7 7/8, up 1 1/2, after a management group and the investment banking firm H.B. Oppenheimer andamp; Co. offered to merge it with an entity formed by Oppenheimer.    Among the decliners, M/A/R/C fell 3 to 10 3/4 after announcing second-quarter earnings that disappointed analysts. The company said it is hiring new staff and incurring expenses in anticipation of new business. Alex M. Cena of William Woodruff andamp; Co. said in an interview that he lowered his 1988 earnings estimates for the marketing research concern and changed his recommendation from hold to sell because he thinks the company's near-term outlook is cloudy.    &quot;Although the reason earnings are down is good for the long term, I don't think they will be able to turn it around for a couple of quarters,&quot; he said.    A spokesman for the Irving, Texas, company conceded that the lower estimate is &quot;appropriate&quot; but said, &quot;The company is still strong, and its future is bright.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
