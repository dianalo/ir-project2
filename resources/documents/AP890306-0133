It was the sixth time that Stockholm's district court grantedprosecutors' requests to hold Christer Pettersson, who was arrestedDec. 14.   Pettersson, 41, who has a history of violent crime and mentalproblems, is suspected of shooting the four-term prime minister indowntown Stockholm. Prosecutors have said they have circumstantialevidence against him but they need further evidence to file charges.   Astrid Holgersson, an expert in witness psychology at StockholmUniversity, charged that Pettersson's detention in solitaryconfinement for nearly three months was a ``psychological assault''that could lead to a ``false confession.''   Holgersson wrote in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that suchtreatment ``can after a few days lead to serious psychologicaldisorders ... and a `confession' aimed at getting out of apsychologically unbearable situation.''   She said it appeared to be an example of ``malpractice against anindividual by the Swedish judicial system.''   Pettersson's lawyer Arne Liljeros, who objected to previousdetention orders, raised no protest against the latest courtdecision.   ``The conditions for my client are OK,'' he told Sweden's TT newsagency. ``He is not subjected to any psychological assault.''   ``We must accept that he is forced to be in jail for a while.After all, there are circumstances against him,'' Liljeros wasquoted as saying.   The search for Palme's killer produced the largest manhunt inSwedish criminal history, centered at first on a suspectedinternational conspiracy. An $8 million reward offer produced nobreakthroughs.   Pressure to solve the case prompted senior officials to sidestepSwedish laws. The former head of the investigation, Hans Holmer, wasdismissed in 1987 amid a dispute with prosecutors over who was incharge of the case.   Former Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon quit in June when itwas revealed she had supported a private investigation into thecase, which included illegal wiretapping and unauthorized access toclassified documents.</TEXT></DOC>
