In Ulsan, about 150 miles south of Seoul, thousands of workershurling firebombs and rocks fought riot police to protest acrackdown on strikers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the nation'slargest shipyard, news reports said.   About 3,000 riot police stormed a complex of 150 high-riseapartments, a stronghold of militant stikers, after battling 5,000workers and radical students on the streets, according to the SouthKorean news agency Yonhap.   Television footage showed protesters yelling and throwing rocksand firebombs from apartment balconies and roofs. Rocks rained downon police, who retaliated with tear gas.   The Korean Broadcasting System said police retreated afterseveral hours of battles that left about 60 police and workersinjured. Police gave no figures on arrests or injuries in the sixdays of protest.   Fighting has taken place daily in Ulsan since March 30 when14,000 riot police stormed the shipyard to end a 109-day strike by5,000 of the company's 19,500 workers who broke off from thecompany union.   Militant workers demanded more pay and better workingconditions. Hyundai officials say non-striking workers have beenassaulted and attacked leaving the yard and the workforce hassteadily declined. On Tuesday, about half the workers showed up.   Stores, banks and schools near the shipyard must close part ofevery day as fighting erupts. Hyundai officials worry the laborunrest will spread to subsidiaries.   Hyundai, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, makes cars,steel, electronics and other products, and employs 100,000 peoplein Ulsan.   Radical students attacked four Hyundai offices in three cities,burning two cars and breaking windows, Yonhap said.   In western Seoul, police in visored helmets stormed the campusof Yonsei University, firing tear gas to disperse ananti-government rally by 1,000 students. In the last two years,police have stayed on the perimeters of colleges and foughtstudents mostly in and around school gates.   The students burned an effigy of President Roh Tae-woo, thendrove police back by hurling firebombs and rocks. They shouted:``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who blocks unification and stiflesworkers' rights!''   The fighting continued about an hour, and police said more than400 students from other colleges were arrested for trying to enterYonsei to take part in the protest after school gates had beensealed off by thousands of police. One student was injured in thehead by police hurling rocks.   The students were protesting the police action in Ulsan andsupporting the trip to North Korea by a dissident, the Rev. MoonIk-kwan.   Moon's unauthorized visit has provoked controversy in SouthKorea, where government officials say he was serving interests ofcommunist North Korea. It has sparked a government crackdown ondissidents, with security officials arresting Moon's colleagues andquestioning others.   Security agencies and police raided dissident offices and homesMonday. Dissidents alleged the government was using Moon's trip asan excuse to crack down on dissent.   Radicals students are a vocal minority with little publicsupport.</TEXT></DOC>
