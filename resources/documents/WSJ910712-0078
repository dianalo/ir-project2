So when theregulators sought a court order to close the scandal-plaguedbank (one of the bank's parent companies is based here), noone was around. After a panicky search led them to thepicnic, one judge was dragooned to set the legal proceedingsin motion. BCCI's closure came just as the U.S. dollarclearing system was opening.   In the wake of the BCCI scandal, that snag is the latestpotential embarrassment for Luxembourg regulators, who haveadopted a minimalist approach to regulating the 180 banksthat are based in this prosperous little grand duchy.</LP><TEXT>   The financial services industry is the bedrock of thistiny country of 365,000 residents. With total assetsequivalent to $350 billion, the industry is Luxembourg'sbiggest employer and accounts for about a fifth of governmentrevenue.   Keeping the industry healthy and happy depends onprojecting a clean, safe image; it also requires Luxembourgto fend off periodic efforts by other European Communitymembers to hack away at the tax and regulatory advantagesthat lure foreign banks to set up shop here.   Clearly, the BCCI scandal has tarnished Luxembourg'simage. It has also revived bad memories of the 1982 collapseof Banco Ambrosiano, an Italian bank that also made use of aLuxembourg holding company. Yves Mersch, director of theLuxembourg Treasury, contends that much of the BCCIfinger-pointing singles out Luxembourg unfairly, butconcedes, &quot;Mud is mud, and it's sticking.&quot; He and othergovernment officials insist that no major changes are neededin Luxembourg's regulatory system and that current ruleswould prevent another BCCI from establishing a beachheadhere.   But the BCCI scandal has erupted at a particularly awkwardtime, just as Luxembourg is launching a glossypublic-relations campaign to press its bid to be host to thecommunity's planned central bank.   BCCI obtained its Luxembourg banking license in 1972.Pierre Jaans, director of the Monetary Institute, saysproblems became evident only after years of headlong growthby BCCI.   Although BCCI had a banking unit and a holding company inLuxembourg, most of its managers and nearly all itsoperations were elsewhere, scattered among more than 60countries. Luxembourg officials admit that they couldn't keeptrack of them all. &quot;Maybe,&quot; says the Treasury's Mr. Mersch,&quot;we put too much confidence in the supervisory authorities ofother countries.&quot;   Last week, regulators in Luxembourg, Britain and othernations alleged that BCCI had been hiding huge losses foryears and closed most of BCCI's operations.   Even before the scandal, Mr. Jaans says his agency wasimproving its ability to monitor banks based here. Since theearly 1980s, he says, the Monetary Institute has refused toallow banks to set up in Luxembourg unless they promise tobase their main managers and operations here. Legislation dueto be considered shortly by the Luxembourg parliament wouldcodify that practice.   Yet officials can be testy about why they didn't actsooner and more forcefully in the case of BCCI. Pressed onthis point, Mr. Jaans slaps his hand on the table where areporter is taking notes. &quot;I hope,&quot; he says icily, &quot;that I amnot under investigation now.&quot;   Mr. Jaans argues that bank regulators would need to use&quot;Orwellian,&quot; police-state tactics to detect and prevent adetermined and clever crook from hoodwinking auditors, anapproach he rejects.   The Monetary Institute has no plans to augment its staffof about 85 people. Mr. Jaans notes that countries with farbigger bureaucracies also have failed to uncover bank fraudand insolvencies.   Indeed, the Monetary Institute wins praise from somequarters. &quot;It seems to me that (the institute) is one of themore effective banking regulators in Europe,&quot; says DavidAndrews, an analyst at IBCA Ltd., a London bank-ratingservice.
