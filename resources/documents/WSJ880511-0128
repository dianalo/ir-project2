The unique proposal would allow ATandamp;T to cut rates to a major customer simply because the customer was being wooed away by an ATandamp;T competitor. The new rates wouldn't be made available to telephone users generally, according to the proposal filed with the Federal Communications Commission in Washington.    The telephone giant, which has been losing big customers to long-distance carriers with lower rates, says Holiday Corp. would be the first customer to be offered additional discounts of as much as 10% under the new plan. The Memphis, Tenn., company -- which oversees Holiday Inns, the largest U.S. hotel chain, and other hotels -- already enjoys the lowest rates possible under current ATandamp;T tariffs.    ATandamp;T says that MCI Communications Corp., a telecommunications company based in Washington, D.C., has won some Holiday business and will shortly win the rest unless ATandamp;T is allowed to slash its rates for select customers. The rate plan is part of a broader initiative by ATandamp;T to keep its biggest and most lucrative business customers.    The FCC in recent months has proved receptive to most of ATandamp;T's proposals. The political mood in Washington, moreover, currently favors increased deregulation of ATandamp;T, whose former telephone monopoly was broken up in January 1984. All the same, the FCC historically has been sensitive to charges that prices favoring any particular class of customer, much less an individual big business, come at the expense of other telephone users.    ATandamp;T says the proposal would provide &quot;flexibility to offer special rate plans to individual customers who have been offered comparable pricing by competing long-distance carriers.&quot; Specifically, Holiday would receive volume-related discounts ranging from 5% to 11% -- but not exceeding an average discount overall of 10%.    MCI, which has enjoyed rapid growth at ATandamp;T's expense, blasted the plan: &quot;ATandamp;T is a dominant carrier, which means it can injure the public by discriminating. ATandamp;T must make general tariff offerings and meet other requirements in order to protect ratepayers and competition.&quot;    US Sprint Communications Co., another ATandamp;T competitor, says the request is yet another sign that the company doesn't want to play by ground rules set by the FCC six years ago. Under the FCC restrictions, ATandamp;T isn't allowed to give special prices to special customers because it is considered a dominant carrier.    Larry Garfinkel, ATandamp;T vice president, marketing services, says that if ATandamp;T can't keep its big customers, it may in the future need to drop small residential users who cost more to serve than they pay.    At Holiday Inns, as elsewhere in the lodging industry, each establishment buys phone service from a carrier and then resells it at a profit to hotel guests. ATandamp;T says hotels are especially concerned about how much they pay for telephone service because the phone rates are a factor in attracting guests. Officials of Holiday couldn't be reached for comment.    ATandamp;T says it expects its new tariff, if approved, to enable it to retain some $29.5 million in revenue that it would otherwise lose in 1989 if Holiday defected to MCI. ATandamp;T projected net income of $1.1 million on those revenues. All ATandamp;T customers would benefit from those earnings, the company says, because the income will help cover common costs that other customers otherwise would have to bear.    According to ATandamp;T, MCI has offered Holiday rates that are even lower than those newly proposed by ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T declined to say why it expected to keep Holiday as a customer with rates not reduced all the way to MCI's level.    ATandamp;T's Mr. Garfinkel says future customers could get ATandamp;T rates that would be lower than those offered by competitors. Under the proposal, ATandamp;T would have to show that its business was being threatened by a competitor and that its specially reduced rates would still cover costs for three years, Mr. Garfinkel says.    The tariff request is just one of a number of pricing plans ATandamp;T intends to propose for big business customers. About 10% of ATandamp;T's eight million to nine million business customers account for 90% of its $11.5 billion of annual business revenue.    ATandamp;T's latest filing comes only a few days before the FCC is scheduled to consider changing how it regulates the company, from requiring a cap on profits to placing a cap on prices, as ATandamp;T has sought. The new request indicates that the company may now be increasingly concerned with gaining flexible pricing. </TEXT></DOC>
