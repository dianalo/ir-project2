The proposal, offered by Mexico at the first meeting between the cartel and non-OPEC oil producers, would mean cuts totaling 200,000 barrels a day for the nonmembers. It would affect production for May and June, with a re-evaluation to be made at the end of June.    For OPEC, which exports some three-fourths of its current output of 18 million barrels a day, the reduction could total close to 700,000 barrels a day.    &quot;It's a very good beginning,&quot; said Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and president of OPEC, which was represented at the meeting by five leading ministers.    But the OPEC ministers aren't likely to quickly approve such a plan. Going into the meeting last night, the OPEC ministers were hardly unified, with Saudi Arabia still insisting that any cuts by the cartel should be made only by enforcing the group's self-imposed production quotas. Most of the OPEC ministers agreed, however, that their reductions should be matched barrel-for-barrel in production cuts by the non-OPEC group, rather than on a percentage basis.    The two groups will reconvene today after breaking up early this morning.    Fernando Hiriart, Mexico's energy minister, called the Vienna meetings &quot;the beginning of a new stage of cooperation between a large number of oil producing countries. . . . We have been in contact with other oil producers and will continue to try to recruit them.&quot;    He said the proposal was well-received by OPEC. &quot;I expect this meeting to be a total success,&quot; he added. &quot;There's not even the thought of the possibility of a negative response.&quot;    It still remains to be seen whether an agreement can be reached. But most observers expect the meetings could result in some production cuts, possibly totaling as much as 500,000 barrels a day, or at least a face-saving move signaling possible future cooperation in balancing world oil markets.    With the rise in petroleum demand, that might be enough to keep oil prices firm through the traditionally weak second quarter, oil traders said.    But even if the two groups can't cut petroleum production on their own, buoyant demand may help bail them out.    As the meeting approached, oil economists and oil company planners sharply raised their projections for 1988 world oil demand. Some have doubled the projected increase in demand to 2%.    &quot;They only have to worry about the next two months,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, a Salomon Brothers Inc. oil economist, referring to the last two months of the second quarter, which is traditionally weak in the oil market. Mr. Mlotok now estimates that 1988 world petroleum demand should increase by one million barrels a day, to 49.5 million barrels.    Reasons for the upturn include higher economic activity in the major oil consuming nations than had been anticipated and a surprisingly large increase in the use of fuels for transportation. High availability and relatively low prices are also cited.    Sun Co., for example, projects that demand for oil in the non-Communist world should average 49.6 million barrels a day this year, up from 48.7 million barrels a day in 1987. This suggests rising demand for oil produced by the 13 OPEC members in the second half, with an average for the entire year around 18 million barrels a day, approximately the current level of production.    &quot;They don't have a lot of heat to drop much below where they are right now,&quot; said Jack W. Wilkinson, Sun's chief economist.    Although the oil exporters are concerned that their action, or inaction, will have a major impact on oil prices, oil economists said the petroleum surplus is shrinking despite the decline in prices for much of this year. &quot;There is no overhang,&quot; said Keith Hamm, president of Petroleum Economics Ltd., a London consulting firm.    Mr. Hamm, who was here to meet with some of his clients among the OPEC countries, said supply and demand in the oil market is balanced. &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;it's balanced at $15 to $16 a barrel.&quot; That is $2 to $3 a barrel less than the exporters were receiving last year. &quot;If there is a reduction in supply&quot; as a result of the joint meetings, &quot;prices will shoot up,&quot; Mr. Hamm said.    Even if the meeting results only in a face-saving move, &quot;the price should rise 60 cents a barrel to $19&quot; on U.S. futures markets, said Neil R. Chandi, president of Crescent International Petroleum Ltd. &quot;If it looks like they are concluding something more dramatic, say cuts of one million barrels, it will go to $20.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
