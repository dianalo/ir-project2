Hot fire tests were conducted to gain insight into thelow mixture ratio ignition and combustion characteristics of coaxialelements as well as to collect data to support the code work. A portionof the recent hot fire testing conducted in this program is discussed.A total of 51 low pressure (100 to 200 psia) hot fire tests were runon a single Space Shuttle Main Engine oxidizer preburner element injector.The results of these tests are the main topic of this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
