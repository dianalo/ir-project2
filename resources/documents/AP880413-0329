The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited CollyerInsulated Wire Co. of Lincoln, R.I., for 102 instances of``willfully'' under-reporting or misrecording workdays thatemployees lost to injuries and the medical treatments they required.   OSHA officials cited one instance in which a worker had to havethe tip of his thumb amputated, and another in which a worker hadto have his index finger amputated.   While both workers were off for several days,government-required records showed them not missing any work,according to the officials.   Collyer, a subsidiary of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based WickesCos., employs about 340 workers at the Lincoln plant.   Officials at the plant referred questions to the parent company.Its spokeswoman, Susan Williams, said Wickes officials would haveno comment on the OSHA charges until after they have studied theagency's complaint.   Under the law, the company has 15 days to either pay the fine orcontest it before a three-judge review panel.   OSHA investigators said there were dozens of cases at theLincoln plant in which workers who were off because of injurieswere told to ``punch in'' for their shifts and then return home.   ``The company called this `light duty,' but in fact theserepresented lost workdays which the company did not report,'' saidTerry Mikelson, a spokesman for the agency. ``In some cases injuredemployees may have collected less in pay and benefits than theywould have under workers' compensation.''   Deputy Assistant Labor Secretary Frank White said the so-calledlight-duty program effectively masked serious injuries and thenumber of lost workays.   It is lost workdays that OSHA, state agencies and insurancecompanies measure in determining whether to inspect a plant and incalculating the premiums it has to pay for workers' compensationinsurance.   ``It was clear to us that Collyer's approach was deliberatelymisleading to OSHA and posssibly to others,'' said George Salem,the Labor Department's solicitor. ``One incentive for companies tounder-report is to keep their workmen's compensation insurancerates low.''</TEXT></DOC>
