Max Theret, a Paris investor who has backed Socialist Partycandidates, was charged Friday by Investigating Magistrate EdithBoizette with insider trading, the news agency Agence-France Presssaid.   Quoting unidentified legal sources, the agency said Theret isaccused of illegally buying shares of a U.S. company, TriangleIndustries Inc., before the French state-owned aluminum manufacturerPichiney SA offered a higher price in a successful takeover. ThePichiney offer sent the stock's price soaring.   On Feb. 16, three men also were charged with insider trading:Paris stockbrokers Pierre-Alain Marsan and Ricardo Zavala; andRobert Reiplinger, Theret's partner in a Paris investment firm. Alsocharged in the scandal that day was Roger-Patrice Pelat, a retiredbusinessman and longtime friend of President Francois Mitterrand.   Theret was not charged with the others because he had beenhospitalized with a heart ailment. French law requires that aninvestigating magistrate notify a suspect face-to-face of criminalcharges.   Pelat and a friend, Isabelle Pierco, have been charged withreceiving insider information and profiting from it. The chargecarries the same maximum penalty as actual insider trading: twoyears in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount of illegalprofits.</TEXT></DOC>
