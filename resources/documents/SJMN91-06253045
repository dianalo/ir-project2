Israel, requesting the loan guaranteesnow, rejects any connection between the immigration and the peace process.;  Would that it were that simple. The immigration of hundreds of thousands ofSoviet Jews will create additional pressure and excuses for Israel to expandJewish settlements on the occupied West Bank. A peace that fails to resolvethe status of the West Bank won't last.;   The peace conference should comefirst. If Israel reaches understandings with Arab countries and with thePalestinians, its case for U.S. help with Soviet immigrants will be that muchstronger.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910909  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  158  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 9, 199100253045,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
