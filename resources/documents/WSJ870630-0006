The strike, which had been expected, began yesterday despite a last-minute meeting Sunday between representatives of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians and NBC, a General Electric Co. unit.    An NBC spokeswoman said management had assumed duties of striking workers &quot;smoothly and without much trouble.&quot; As previously reported, NBC has been training managers for union jobs for more than six months. NBC and the union remain far apart on issues including NBC's demand for greater use of temporary employees, the length of the new contract and the union's demand for a four-day workweek.    NBC had said its most recent contract offer was its final one, and it threatened to put its terms into effect with or without union approval.    Federal mediators who called Sunday's meeting weren't able to persuade the two sides to agree on key issues, and NBC implemented a two-year contract to replace a four-year agreement that expired March 31.    The union, which last struck NBC in 1976, represents about a third of NBC's employees, including many who work at its television network, television stations and radio operations. A union spokesman said striking members were picketing NBC facilities in New York, Los Angeles and other cities. </TEXT></DOC>
