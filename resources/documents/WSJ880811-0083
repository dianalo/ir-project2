Aside from a takeover-related surge in Farmers Group, most of Nasdaq's major stocks were battered as Wall Street's downturn hurt an OTC market already suffering from a lack of individual-investor interest. Though yesterday's volume of 136.7 million shares was the highest on Nasdaq in more than three weeks, it still fell well short of the daily average of 150 million shares at this time last year.    The composite index of 4,625 OTC issues lost 5.72 to 378.51. It was the biggest drop since the index fell 6.19 on May 11, when the stock market was hurt by an increase in the prime lending rate.    The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC non-financial issues -- including such stocks as MCI Communications, Intel, Apple Computer, Micron Technology and LSI Logic -- plunged an even steeper 9.18 to 345.36. These big Nasdaq stocks often perform like exchange-listed issues and plummet when stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average do likewise. This week, both the Nasdaq 100 and the industrial average have fallen 4%.    That weakness in Nasdaq's biggest issues proves that some Nasdaq indexes are meaningless in terms of the performance of smaller stocks, said Jack A. Sullivan, a principal at Van Kasper andamp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage firm specializing in newer growth companies.    &quot;The Nasdaq 100 companies are the ones that the Nasdaq people point to with pride, and rightfully so,&quot; he said, &quot;but the secondary and tertiary OTC stocks most definitely are outperforming the Nasdaq 100 stocks,&quot; at least this week.    F. Van Kasper, president of the firm, said the OTC rally in the first quarter was a case of the &quot;bottom&quot; of the market catching up; now, the &quot;top&quot; is coming down a bit, he said. Van Kasper, like other firms selling to OTC investors, continues to predict that smaller-capitalization companies will outperform others in coming years.    This was how some of Van Kasper's recommended stocks fared yesterday:   --MDT, a dental and hospital instrument sterilizer, slipped 3/8 to 12 1/2.    --Emcon Associates, a designer of waste-disposal sites, lost 1/2 to 14 1/4.    --Flextronics, an electronics firm, was unchanged at 5 3/4.    --Hollywood Park, a real estate investment trust, was quoted at 19 3/4 bid, unchanged.    Among the most active Nasdaq stocks, only Farmers Group advanced. The Los Angeles-based insurer soared 5 3/4 to 63 1/2 on nearly three million shares, tops on Nasdaq yesterday. Late Tuesday, B.A.T Industries of Britain sweetened its bid for Farmers to $72 a share.    The Farmers advance helped the Nasdaq insurance index rise 3.64 to 409.19, making it the only Nasdaq index to post a gain.    London House jumped 2 1/2 to 12 1/2, a 25% gain that led the Nasdaq advancers list.    Maxwell Communication agreed to acquire the Park Ridge, Ill., maker of personneltest computation systems for $13.25 a share.    Moto Photo, which was trading as low as 3 1/4 last week, added 3/8 to a 52-week high of 4 3/8. Volume of 64,000 shares was more than six times the average for the stock. Analysts noted that the rapidly growing chain of one-hour photo-processing stores recently reported second-quarter earnings of three cents a share, reversing a one-cent loss the year earlier. But Michelle Davis of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. said that although the earnings were encouraging, she is surprised the stock has jumped as high as 4 3/8.    &quot;It would seem to me that (the stock price) is getting a little ahead of itself on an earnings basis,&quot; she said.    Henley Manufacturing fell 2 5/8 to 57 7/8. The stock had been rising since Michael Dingman, chairman of Henley Group, the company's parent, announced in June that he would boost his stake to 20.9%. But Mr. Dingman was in The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column yesterday as saying, &quot;The odds are that I may not take Henley Manufacturing private.&quot; Henley Group lost 5/8 to 23 3/4.    Overall, 79.9 million shares in 1,653 Nasdaq issues fell yesterday, and only 18.8 million shares in 596 issues rose. </TEXT></DOC>
