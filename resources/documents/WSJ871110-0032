The issue involves a U.S. takeover regulation known as Rule 10b-13. Under the rule, Texaco argues, Pennzoil's contract with Getty Oil was unlawful because Pennzoil negotiated a private deal to buy a major stake while continuing a public tender offer. And, as most law-abiding citizens appreciate, &quot;contracts&quot; that violate public policy -- whether involving drugs, murders or mergers -- are invalid.    For that and other reasons, Texaco says, it was free to grab Getty Oil from Pennzoil's clutches and shouldn't be forced to pay a $10.3 billion judgment, despite 12 jurors and three appellate judges having unanimously found that it should. Texaco touts a number of constitutional issues as grounds for high court jurisdiction in the case, but it is counting on the 10b-13 argument as its ace in the hole.    In some respects, Texaco's seizing onto the rule is reminiscent of a burglary suspect demanding dismissal of his charges because he never received his Miranda warning. But suspects often go free on technicalities, regardless of the merits of the case against them.    And besides putting forward a defense against the Pennzoil judgment, Texaco has another goal in making the claim: a new legal forum. The Texaco-Pennzoil litigation primarily involves issues of contracts -- whether Pennzoil had one to acquire part of Getty Oil, and whether Texaco &quot;tortiously,&quot; or wrongfully, interfered with it when it bought all of Getty for itself. Contracts and torts are matters of state law. But 10b-13 is a federal rule, and only a federal issue can give Texaco a ticket to the U.S. Supreme Court -- Texaco's court of last resort to reverse the judgment following last week's refusal by the Texas Supreme Court to review it.    Texaco has 90 days, dating from last week's Texas court decision, to request U.S. Supreme Court review -- unless it stops the clock temporarily by asking the Texas court to reconsider its decision.    Rule 10b-13, issued in 1968, prohibits anyone who has announced a tender offer from buying shares -- or even arranging to buy them -- except through the tender offer. By preventing raiders from striking side deals with big shareholders, the rule helps assure that all shareholders will be treated equally. Violations occur rarely.    Two days after Christmas in 1983 Pennzoil made an unsolicited $100-a-share tender offer for 20% of Getty Oil. Pennzoil had good reasons to seek only one-fifth of the shares. For one, Getty Oil was six times larger than Pennzoil. For another, a narrow majority of Getty Oil's stock rested in private hands: 40% with Gordon Getty and 12% with the J. Paul Getty Museum. Quickly, the major shareholders cast their lot with Pennzoil. Mr. Getty and Pennzoil would jointly take Getty Oil private, purchasing the shares held by the museum and the public in a negotiated merger in which the price for all shares would be $110 a share.    The going-private transaction required approval by Getty Oil's directors, which voted 15-to-1 to &quot;accept the Pennzoil proposal&quot; at a further sweetened price of $112.50 a share, as the secretary's notes of the meeting showed. To this day, Getty Oil lawyers maintain that Pennzoil refused to drop its original, $100-a-share tender offer as &quot;a gun to the head,&quot; in the words of a former Getty Oil lawyer.    Ironically, the second half of the alleged rule violation involved a former SEC chairman, Harold Williams, president of the Getty Museum. In supporting Pennzoil's going-private plan, Mr. Williams demanded his $1 billion payment for the museum's shares immediately -- up front and non-refundable. That way, the museum could earn interest of $30 million or more while the public was waiting weeks to receive the cash for its shares.    In essence, the former SEC chairman was demanding better treatment than other shareholders, if only slightly better treatment.    No one identified these developments as possible 10b-13 violations until the evening of Jan. 5, 1984, when a phalanx of lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty Oil were huddled over a draft contract to complete the going-private transaction.    &quot;Wait a second,&quot; one of the Getty Oil lawyers piped up.    Pennzoil, he pointed out, had already arranged to buy the museum shares without first withdrawing the unsolicited tender offer. Pennzoil, the Getty lawyer said, had a 10b-13 problem.    &quot;Is that right?&quot; asked a surprised Pennzoil lawyer, according to court testimony.    &quot;Yes,&quot; answered the Getty lawyer.    &quot;I think he's right,&quot; said another Getty lawyer.    &quot;Well,&quot; said the Pennzoil man. &quot;What can be done about it?&quot;    The question was moot before an answer could be found. For later that same night, the Getty Oil lawyers were called away from the drafting session with Pennzoil to another law office -- where representatives of Texaco awaited them with a higher offer. Within eight hours, Texaco had broken up the deal with Pennzoil and locked up the acquisition of Getty Oil, including the shares held by Mr. Getty and the museum, at $125 a share.    In Texaco's view, Pennzoil's refusal to drop the tender offer throughout its dealmaking was evidence that Pennzoil didn't have a contract, and knew it didn't. Indeed, in a filing after the 15-to-1 vote by the Getty Oil board, Pennzoil told the SEC that it would withdraw the tender offer &quot;if a definitive agreement is executed.&quot;    But there is plenty of evidence on both sides over whether Pennzoil had a contract. The major 10b-13 tests Texaco must now pass on its appeal are whether that contract, if it existed, was lawful; if unlawful, whether it was void; and if void, whether that gets Texaco off the hook for interfering with it.    In some hypothetical, off-the-cuff remarks during the trial, a Pennzoil lawyer appeared to concede that Texaco could meet these tests. If 10b-13 was an &quot;impediment,&quot; the lawyer noted, &quot;then in fact our contract was void. . . . And if our contract was void, we have no case.&quot;    An individual at Pennzoil asserts that the lawyer's comments are meaningless. They were made during an argument about the admissability of certain testimony -- not in a discussion of the law -- and that Pennzoil had attacked Texaco's 10b-13 argument from the moment it was raised, the individual said.    On the issue of whether Pennzoil actually violated the rule, Texaco has obtained the indisputably meaningful backing of the SEC itself. In a brief filed with the Texas Supreme Court, the SEC stated that Pennzoil's alleged contract &quot;plainly violated 10b-13.&quot; Citing numerous precedents, Pennzoil says Texaco must prove that Pennzoil intended to defraud public shareholders through its early-purchase arrangement with the museum -- proof, it says, that doesn't exist. Citing equally numerous precedents, Texaco and the SEC say 10b-13 is a &quot;bright line&quot; rule with no room for interpretation -- that by arranging to purchase shares privately with its tender offer outstanding Pennzoil walked over the line of legality.    The SEC has left Texaco on its own to argue that Pennzoil's contract is also unlawful. In this respect Texaco cites another rule stating that &quot;every contract made in violation&quot; of the act &quot;shall be void,&quot; as well as case law saying that &quot;illegal&quot; contracts are unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Besides deriding this as a &quot;frantic characterization,&quot; Pennzoil cites law saying that unlawful contracts may be merely &quot;voidable&quot; by the victim rather than &quot;void&quot; automatically. And although Getty Oil itself walked away from its arrangements with Pennzoil, it didn't do so because of a 10b-13 violation.    Which leads to the final issue, and perhaps the greatest hurdle for Texaco to clear. &quot;Texaco has no right even to invoke Rule 10b-13,&quot; Pennzoil claims. Only the shareholders of Getty Oil have any standing to assert the rule, Pennzoil says, because only they fall within the &quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by 10b-13. It would &quot;turn the Exchange Act on its head&quot; to enable a third party such as Texaco to exploit the rule &quot;to excuse its wantonly tortious conduct,&quot; Pennzoil says.    Pennzoil also asserts that Texaco never obtained a jury finding -- indeed, never asked for one -- that Pennzoil's contract discriminated against the public shareholders. (The jury did make a finding, at Texaco's request, that the museum shares were to be purchased &quot;forthwith.&quot;)    Texaco defends its standing to invoke Rule 10b-13 by citing the Constitution. The Supremacy Clause, Texaco argues, prohibits states from awarding damages to anyone who has broken federal law, giving Texaco grounds to seek reversal of the judgment. Among other things, Texaco adds, it has the right to invoke the rule &quot;as a matter of law, fairness and due respect for the states' obligations . . .&quot;    Texaco feels it need only get its foot in the door of the Supreme Court; after that, the company passionately believes, it will obtain reversal of the Pennzoil judgment, either on 10b-13 or any other issue.    But Texaco has already made one unsuccessful trip to the Supreme Court in the case -- and on an issue pitting state against federal law. In April, the court ruled 9-0 to dissolve a federal court order that had freed Texaco from paying a multibillion-dollar appeals bond, as provided for under Texas law.    Says Laurence Tribe, the Harvard University constitutional scholar who argued that case for Pennzoil: &quot;Experience counsels some caution in putting too much faith on Texaco's latest effort to make a federal case out of it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
