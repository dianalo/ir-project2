(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A United Mine Workers wildcat strikethat grew during the week to include more than 20,000 miners in sixstates shows no sign of ending, UMW officials say.   ``We're having trouble keeping them in the mines,'' said RogerMyers, international executive board member for UMW District 11 inIndiana.   On Friday, the wildcat walkout idled 2,500 miners inPennsylvania, 1,390 in Indiana, 790 in Virginia, 295 in Kentucky,200 in Tennessee and about two-thirds of West Virginia's 24,000miners, company officials said.   At AMAX Coal Co.'s Ayrshire Mine at Chandler, Ind., UMW Local1907 President Greg Young said after a union meeting Friday thatworkers will continue to strike, although he told them the UMWconstitution and contract require them to return to work.   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton said he ``is continuing everyday in a quiet, behind-the-scenes way talking to both sides to seewhat we can do in state government to bring this to an end.''   The walkout began Monday in southern West Virginia in sympathywith about 1,600 UMW members on strike against the Pittston CoalGroup in West Virginia and Virginia.   The original strike by West Virginia and Virginia miners began inApril when Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation to negotiate with the union independently. The two sideshave failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.   In Pennsylvania, District 2 President Nick Molnar said unionofficials planned to tell each of the 52 local unions that theirmembers should report to work as usual. Molnar said he could notpredict whether the miners would obey.   Molnar was among union leaders who led a Friday morning rally byabout 5,000 miners in Ebensburg, Pa., near Johnstown.   Molnar said the miners supported striking Pittston workers andcriticized the court system which, he said, is ``practicing economicterrorism against the mine workers' organization.''   In Hazleton, Pa., meanwhile, District 25 officials are organizingminers who could leave on short notice from UMW President RichardTrumka to picket in support of the Pittston strikers, said Bill Ray,District 25 president and an acting member of the union'sinternational executive board.   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Kidd in Clarksburg issuedback-to-work orders for seven Consolidation Coal Co. mines innorthern West Virginia. Striking miners have ignored similar ordersin southern West Virginia all week.   The strikers Friday included about 1,600 miners who failed toreport for work at Rochester andamp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations incentral Pennsylvania, company spokesman Hank Waneck said.   ``We are being penalized for a labor problem in another area. Itappears that the United Mine Workers are returning to the era ofinstability of the 1970s, which contributed to the decline of UMWmined coal from 70 percent to less than 35 percent of the nation'sproduction today,'' Waneck said.</TEXT></DOC>
