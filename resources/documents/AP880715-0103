But thedrought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaringat their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.   The Labor Department said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent lastmonth, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985.Further along in the wholesale process, however, prices for foodsready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting earlier, thoughless severe, increases in raw food costs.   Some examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level:   _Wheat, 25.3 percent.   _Corn, 24.3 percent.   _Turkeys, 22.8 percent.   _Soybeans 22.0 percent.   _Chickens, 22.5 percent.   Reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animalsthey cannot afford or find feed for, cattle prices fell 5.2 percentwhile hog prices were down 4.0 percent.   The news was not quite so severe at the finished-goods level.Prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent while turkey prices gained 9.3percent, chicken prices jumped 7.3 percent and fresh fruit costsgained 6.7 percent.   Those gains were partially offset by a 5.7 percent decline invegetable prices and a 2.2 percent decrease for rice.   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University, saidthat prices of foods made from grain, such a vegetable oils, bakeryproducts and pasta, likely will continue to rise, and that the dropin vegetable prices won't last. Meat prices should continue to fallthrough late autumn, but will then head higher after thedrought-induced slaughtering tails off, he said.   ``Next year we'll probably see the full impact of the drought,particularly if it persists. Up until this week we could say,`Well, if we get some rain, we'll probably be all right.' But thisweek is the last week we can say that,'' he said.   Energy prices, meanwhile, fell at the finished level by 1.6percent. Leading the way was a drop of 7.1 percent for fuel oilwhile declines of 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent were posted forgasoline and natural gas respectively.   Further energy price declines are considered likely becausecrude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowestlevels in nearly two years.   ``We can just thank our fortunes that OPEC can't get together onrestraint of production. I hate to think what the report would looklike if oil prices were rising,'' Kottman said.   In other economic news:   _The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit roseslightly in May to $10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still thesecond smallest in almost three years. The gap between imports andexports widened by $627 million from a revised April imbalance of$10.3 billion.   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation'sfactories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June,the ninth consecutive month without a decline. The June increase,boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave,pushed industrial output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago.   _Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to$728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales to$483.7 billion, the Commerce Department said.   Overall, if the June increase in wholesale finished goods pricesheld for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987.   Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices,wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month.   Analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economy'sunderlying inflation. Even with steep food price gains anticipatedfor the several months, many economists feel the effect of thosegains will be only temporary.   For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail roseat a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding foodand energy prices, wholesale costs rose 4.0 over that period.   Prices from March through June have risen at a monthly rate ofeither 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent.   At the finished level, the department gave these other pricechanges:   _Passenger car prices, up 1.0 percent.   _Women's clothing, up 1.0 percent.   _Home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent.   _Cosmetics, down 0.6 percent.   The June increase brought the wholesale price index for finishedgoods to 107.9, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goodscosting $100 in 1982 would have cost $107.90 last month, 40 centsmore than in May.   This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as areother calculations in the report.   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks services and importedgoods not included in the wholesale price report, has risen at aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first fivemonths of the year, the same rate as for all of 19878.   Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.</TEXT></DOC>
