The official Saudi press agency, which carried the news, said that details of the budget will be announced tomorrow. Bankers have estimated that spending in the new budget, which is for the fiscal year that began last March but has been delayed because of uncertainty about world oil prices, will total the equivalent of between $32 billion and $37 billion. Budgeted expenditures in fiscal 1986 were $53.3 billion.    In a natiowide speech, King Fahd said: &quot;The kingdom has gone through (difficult) circumstances related to oil production, which dropped dramatically. When the figures come out, citizens will see that there will be a decrease (in public expenditures) compared with last year.&quot;    The king expressed hope that world oil prices will rise to $17 a barrel or more by mid-1987, &quot;but this hinges on solidarity among OPEC member countries.&quot;    &quot;This solidarity will benefit not merely Saudi Arabia but all OPEC members as well,&quot; he said. The king's use of the $17 figure seemed to suggest that the kingdom planned to use that level as a basis for calculating future revenues.    The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries launched an effort earlier this month to cut production and sell oil at fixed prices averaging $18 a barrel. </TEXT></DOC>
