(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group that says treaties giving Indiansspecial fishing and other rights are discriminatory has hit upon anovel fund-raising approach: It's selling beer. But critics say``Treaty Beer'' is nothing but ``hate and prejudice in a can.''   Gov. Booth Gardner, Sen. Dan Evans, church groups and othercritics on Thursday denounced plans to market the brew inWashington and called for a boycott.   The first 2,500 cases of the beer are scheduled to arrive inPierce County next week. Profits are to be earmarked for challengesto Indian treaty rights.   Dean Crist, president of Stop Treaty Abuse, the group thatcreated the beer, said his home state of Wisconsin and perhaps 40other states are having disputes over treaties giving Indiansrights to fish, hunt game and use other natural resources.   Treaty Beer was test-marketed in Wisconsin and sold more than70,000 cans in the first week, Crist said. Crist said he expects amillion cases _ 24 million cans _ to be sold every year inWashington.   The headline on advertising being run in Washington newspaperssays ``Vote with your mouth.''   Some of the profits will be used to press for implementation ofInitiative 456, said Steve Arbaugh, president of the Puget SoundGillnetters Association, a group of commercial fishermen inWashington.   Washington state voters approved the initiative in 1984, callingfor Congress to rescind old treaties that were interpreted byfederal judges as guaranteeing Indian fishermen in Washington theright to half the fish in their usual and accustomed fishinggrounds.   In separate actions Thursday, the governor issued a denunciationand called for a boycott of the beer, and other critics staged ajoint press conference in Seattle.   ``Treaty Beer is not welcome in Washington and I ask allcitizens to join me in renouncing the effort to market it in ourstate,'' Gardner said.   The governor said ``cooperation, not confrontation'' has finallybeen achieved in the wake of the court action as the state hasdeveloped peaceful, joint management of fisheries.   Gardner added: ``There is very little the state can do tolegally stop the sale of this product _ except to stronglydiscourage people to buy it.''   The Seattle press conference featured comments from Evans,Indian rights activists, and representatives of the Church Councilof Greater Seattle, the forest industry and environmentalists.   Evans, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs, said he was ``saddened to think that outside agitators seeour state as fertile ground for their message of hate.''   Stuart Bledsoe, head of the Washington Forest ProtectionAssociation, blasted the ``rascist mentality,'' and added, ``Werecognize this brew for what it is: hate and prejudice in a can.''   In a separate press conference later, Crist and Arbaugh deniedthey were racist. Crist, who called himself an ardent sportsfisherman, said his group thinks treaties that give special fishingrights to Indians are unfair to other fishermen.   ``I don't see it as a Ku Klux Klan issue,'' said Arbaugh. ``Idon't see it as an issue to deprive someone of something. ... Idon't understand why people try to point this out as a racistissue. Racism is when people get special rights.''   But Bill Frank Jr., chairman of the Northwest Indian FisheriesCommission, called it ``an effort by anti-Indian extremists toviolate treaties.'' He called the beer's promoters ``fringe-elementradicals who consider Indian land and resources fair game to filltheir own pockets.''   Officials at Schoenling Brewing Co. Cincinnati, which is makingthe beer under contract for Stop Treaty Abuse, did not returntelephone messages left Thursday seeking comment.</TEXT></DOC>
