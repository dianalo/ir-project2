Shall weexpand, be inclusive, find unity and power; or suffer division andimpotence,'' Jackson asked a packed hall. ``The only time we win iswhen we come together.''   Jackson, calling his own work ``ancient and endless,'' neverendorsed the Massachusetts governor for the presidency in the50-minute speech to the Democratic National Convention.   ``I'll make the appropriate decision at the appropriate time,''Jackson said afterward.   Even without the endorsement, the Dukakis campaign termed thespeech was ``terrific.''   Campaign manager Susan Estrich said, ``I think everyone in theDukakis campaign tonight stands side-by-side with our friends inthe Jackson campaign.''   After the address _ the final major speech of his remarkable1988 campaign for the White House _ Jackson dived into the mass ofdelegates on the convention floor to shake hands and receivecongratulations.   He had been scheduled to speak in prime television time, but theplatform debates sought by his forces pushed its start to the verylast minute before 11 p.m. on the East Coast.   Jackson was introduced by his five children and by a brief filmhighlighting his campaign efforts.   ``To many he is a hero. To us he is also our father,'' saidJesse L. Jackson Jr.   Jackson was greeted by a sea of red ``Jesse! Jesse! Jesse!''signs as he walked to the podium with his wife Jackie. Dukakisaides urged the blue Dukakis signs be kept down during the speechand some Dukakis delegates gave up their seats to Jacksonalternates to give them a better view of their candidate.   Like never before, Jackson praised Dukakis.   ``Tonight I salute Gov. Michael Dukakis,'' he said. ``He has runa well-managed and dignified campaign. No matter how tired or howtried, he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery.   ``I have watched a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves,guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to theworst of us. I have watched his perspective grow as his environmenthas expanded. I've seen his toughness and tenacity close up.''   Over and over again, Jackson returned to the image that has beencentral to his second bid for the presidency _ common ground.   ``When we divide, we cannot win. So our challenge here is tofind common ground,'' Jackson said.   As he has before, Jackson noted that he and Dukakis had widelydifferent backgrounds. ``There are differences of religion, regionand race, differences in experience and perspectives, but thegenius of America is that out of the many we become one,'' he said.   ``His foreparents came to America in immigrant ships. Myforeparents came to America on slave ships. But whatever theoriginal ships, we are both in the same boat tonight,'' Jacksonsaid. ``Our ships could pass in the night _ if we have a falsesense of independence _ they could collide and crash ... But we canseek a higher reality and a greater good ... At our highest, we cancall upon our noble instincts and navigate this vessel to safety.''   After the long campaign, Jackson said, he and Dukakis have cometogether and ``share a common commitment to new priorities, toexpansion and to inclusion.''   But he hinted there were still rough spots in the relationship.   ``There is a higher good beyond personal comfort or position.The good of our nation is at stake,'' he said.   Jackson gave an emotional history of the civil rights movementthat gave him his start and opened the door for his twin bids forthe presidency.   ``My right and my privilege to stand here before you has beenwon _ in my lifetime _ by the blood and the sweat of theinnocent,'' he said.   ``Dr. Martin Luther King lies only a few miles from us,''Jackson said. ``Tonight he must feel good as he looks down upon us... His heart would be full tonight.''   And Jackson brought Rosa Parks, whose refusal to sit in the backof a Birmingham bus triggered King's rise to prominence, to thepodium, saying all the delegates are really standing on hershoulders.   Stressing unity, Jackson said the continuation of his campaignthrough the Wednesday night roll call was a necessary step inhistory.   ``As a statement to the struggles of those who have gone before;as a legacy for those who will come after; as a tribute to theendurance, the patience, the courage of our forefathers andmothers; as an assurance that their prayers are being answered;their work was not in vain; and hope is eternal _ tomorrow night myname will go into nomination for the presidency of the UnitedStates.''   Jackson made clear that his crusade is not over, even afterDukakis formally wins the party's nomination Wednesday night.   ``My work to keep America strong and make America better isancient and endless. We can win,'' Jackson said.   Jackson closed his speech with what has become a slogan for himand for his political efforts for the future:   ``Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive.''   Before the speech, Jackson's supporters were predicting thatemotions within the convention hall would reach an emotional peakwhen the civil rights leader stepped to the podium.   ``They might have to come take me out in an ambulance,'' saidalternate Alvin Dollar of Decatur, Ga.   And afterward, the reaction was positive.   ``The man is on target. Nobody can do it better,'' said StateRep. Al Edwards of Texas.   Many of those who sought to hear Jackson were denied entrance toThe Omni when the fire marshal declared the convention hall filledto capacity, stranding hundreds of delegates, guests and reporters.Some delegates were allowed to re-enter the hall in time for thespeech.   Jackson's address recalled his performance at the 1984Democratic Convention in San Francisco.   Then, at the end of his first bid for the presidency, Jacksonbrought the Democratic delegates to theirfeet with tears in theireyes with his apology for the ``low moments'' of his historic runfor the White House.   ``That was not my truest self,'' Jackson told a hushed SanFrancisco hall four years ago. ``If there were occasions when mygrape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance,please forgive me. ... As I develop and serve, be patient. God isnot finished with me yet.''   Jackson used that speech to deliver his endorsement of the 1984Democratic presidential nominee, Walter Mondale, but at the sametime proclaimed that his own crusade _ the Rainbow Coalition _would continue.</TEXT></DOC>
