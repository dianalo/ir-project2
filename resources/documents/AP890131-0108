HumanRights Commission that Israel has killed about 60 Palestinians inthe occupied territories by misusing tear gas.   A PLO spokesman, meanwhile, told the 43-nation commission thatPalestinian children were being killed in ``Israeli gas chambers.''Nabil Ramlawi, a Palestine Liberation Organization representative,said the Israeli practices were ``reaching war crime proportions.''   ``It's all a great lie,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel.   Ramlawi charged that pregnant Arab women were beaten, causingthem to miscarry, and that organs were stolen from dead Palestiniansto be used in transplant operations in Israeli hospitals.   A text of Ramlawi's speech was not available, but an unofficialsummary paraphrasing his speech said his comments on ``Israeli gaschambers'' seemed to refer to the use of tear gas.   The 13-month Palestinian revolt in the Israeli-occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip has claimed the lives of 370 Palestinians and 15Israelis. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by Israel,which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the 1967Middle East war.   Amnesty's statement said it was gravely concerned because Israeliauthorities ``appear so far to have condoned if not encouraged theexcessive use of force, knowing that it would result in the death orinjury of thousands of people.''   Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot and killed byIsraeli soldiers during the uprising, and that thousands of otherpeople were shot and injured, many critically.   ``Deaths in the occupied territories have also been caused by theapparently deliberate misuse of tear gas, fired for example intohospitals and homes,'' Amnesty said. ``This has happened despiteexplicit instructions from the manufacturer not to use tear gas inconfined spaces as it is potentially lethal.''   It said about 60 people were reported to have died in ``tear-gasrelated incidents, some of them as a direct result of its misuse.''   Pazner denied all the allegations. ``It's all nonsense,'' hesaid. ``Israel does all it can to cause the minimum damage toproperty and, of course, with respect to human life. Israel hascertainly not shot into hospitals.''   Amnesty said only three Israeli soldiers were reported to havebeen convicted following fatal shootings, with the longest sentencebeing 18 months in jail for manslaughter. Amnesty said a few othersoldiers drew lesser terms for punitive beatings.   ``No prosecutions in cases of apparently deliberate misuse oftear gas resulting in deaths are known to have been initiated,'' itsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
