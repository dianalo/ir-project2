It is introduced through two slotslocated opposite each other in the suction canal, through which slotsthe gas flows at very high velocity in the transition range already andat the speed of sound in the partial load range. Through this is achieveda considerable lowering of the toxic gas components, a reduction of fuelconsumption and an improved thermal efficiency of the internal combustionengine.</TEXT></DOC>
