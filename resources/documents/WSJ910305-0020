Optimism about the prospect of U.S. exports to the MiddleEast and unseasonably dry weather in the southern Plainsstates prompted some traders to buy wheat futures contracts.But analysts focused on underlying factors that they saidalso supported the rally.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Agriculture Department exhausted its allotment ofexport bonus credits last week, and authorization for anadditional $475 million of such credits is stalled in theHouse of Representatives. In the absence of bonus-creditcompetition from U.S. suppliers, the European Communityscaled back its awarding of food aid as well.   The result, analysts said, was a market acting withoutgovernment stimulation and responding purely to supply anddemand for the first time in months. The effect on prices hasbeen bullish, with wheat futures leading a rally that hasincluded nearly all grain futures contracts for three days ina row.   In active trading, wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/2cents to $2.9050 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,while corn for May delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.56 abushel, and the May soybean contract rose 3 1/2 cents to$6.01 a bushel.   Daniel Basse, director of market research for AgResourceCo., Chicago, said the temporary absence of subsidies and thereturn to a market based on supply and demand &quot;was a verypositive fundamental for wheat prices.&quot;   This and other factors brought commodity funds, which arepools of money managed by commodity specialists, into themarket as active buyers the past three sessions, Mr. Bassesaid.   Some analysts were skeptical of strong rumors in themarket that the U.S. might be considering granting food aidto Middle East nations. Most of those countries, they said,had been buying U.S. grain throughout the Persian Gulf war.And even if the U.S. wanted to ship grain to Iraq, thecountry would have difficulty distributing it because of themassive damage inflicted on its bridges and roads by U.S. andallied bombing raids during the just-ended conflict. Inaddition, the analysts said, Iraqis would rather receive riceand lamb products than wheat, corn and soybeans.   Weather in growing regions, meanwhile, has been dry inKansas as well as in grain-growing regions of Brazil. Butanalysts said some current expectations about the dryweather's impact on the crop may be exaggerated.   Conditions in the Plains states, where much of the U.S.wheat crop is grown, won't matter for weeks, as the wheatcrop there is still in its dormant stage. And analysts saidthe market has already taken into account the adverse weatherconditions in South America.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: A number of factors, including a fatal refineryexplosion in Louisiana and expectations that OPEC will curbproduction, boosted crude oil futures prices in New York andin London. Three workers died and 10 were injured in a Citgorefinery explosion and fire in Lake Charles, La., Sundaynight, officials there reported. Part of the 320,000barrel-a-day refinery is expected to be shut down for severalweeks. The accident, along with maintenance closings that areplanned at other such facilities this spring, helped pushunleaded gasoline for April delivery up 3.95 cents a gallonto settle at 69.40 cents yesterday on the New York MercantileExchange. In turn, gasoline's strength plus U.S. EnergySecretary James Watkins's statement that he expects theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to ease up onproduction pushed crude oil prices on the exchange to $20.25a barrel, up 87 cents. An industry newsletter, the MiddleEast Economic Survey, reported that some OPEC members aresaying they will seek to cut production by two millionbarrels a day, or about 8.5%, in the second quarter to averta price slide. The group will meet in Geneva starting Mondayfor its first session since Iraqi forces were driven out ofKuwait by the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf war.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. After peaking at$3.9150 an ounce, silver for May delivery finished at $3.90,up 8.2 cents. April gold rose 90 cents an ounce to $369.50.Silver continues to rally on optimism that demand for it willincrease as the U.S. economy improves, said Fred Demler, ametals economist at PaineWebber. The rise gained momentum asthe price passed certain technical levels, he said. Inaddition, commodity funds have become aggressive buyers ofsilver, citing its improving technical outlook, after beingextremely bearish, Mr. Demler said. William O'Neill, afutures strategist at Merrill Lynch, cautioned that much ofthe rally has been fueled by short-covering, or the buying ofoffsetting contracts by investors who had bet on a drop inprices. &quot;This doesn't indicate that the bulls by any meanshave taken control of the market,&quot; he said, adding thatsilver would have to establish itself above $4 to convincehim it isn't any longer in a declining trend. Lawrence Heim,who publishes the Heim Investment Letter in Portland, Ore.,and is bullish on silver, blamed its decline to a low of$3.55 an ounce in the May contract on Feb. 22 onshort-selling and said he thinks &quot;that game is over with.&quot;Silver will confront some technical resistance between $4 and$4.40, he predicted, but if it rises above that range, itwill make major upward moves. PaineWebber's Mr. Demler saidthat based on the &quot;extreme turnaround and change insentiment&quot; he sees toward silver, he wouldn't be surprised tosee it trading at $4.25 to $4.50 within a month.                                                                                                          CRB FUTURES PRICE INDEX: The rally in grains and soybeansagain pushed up the index, which rose 1.75 points to end at219.69. Analysts are watching the index closely as itapproaches 220, where it will encounter technical resistance.If it fails to rise above 223, the current rally is probablyjust a short-term bounce, said John Murphy, president of JJMTechnical Advisors Inc., River Edge, N.J. However, a movebeyond 223 would confirm the rally's strength and possiblyrenew inflation fears, he said. The index's recentperformance &quot;seems to indicate that there's more to go inthis rally,&quot; Mr. Murphy said. James M. Nevler, a financialanalyst at the Commodity Research Bureau in New York, saidthe rise in commodity prices reflects expectations ofincreased demand in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war,rather than any actual change in demand so far.</TEXT></DOC>
