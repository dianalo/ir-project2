The systemuses a minicomputer to acquire meteorological data from automated monitoringsites, conduct data processing, and archive data. Personal computer (PC)workstations are used to retrieve archived data from the minicomputer,generate displays of meteorological data, model the atmospheric dispersionand deposition of potential atmospheric releases, and produce high-resolution,color graphics to display model output. User-friendly menus and formsmake the system easy to use and the single-user environment on the PCworkstation allows for fast and consistent model performance. 3 refs.,5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
