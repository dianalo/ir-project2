The Norfolk, Va.-based railroad holding company said it will pay $40,000 each to conductors, trainmen and brakemen who choose to leave the railroad. Under a previous one-time compensation package offered last October, train-service employees were eligible for a $25,000 payment.    A spokesman declined to say how many workers had accepted the first offer, but he added that &quot;we revived the program by raising the incentive in hopes of attracting a larger number of candidates.&quot;    Younger workers who take the $40,000 offer aren't entitled to other severance benefits, the spokesman said, but older employees who choose to quit the railroad will retain their retirement benefits in addition to receiving the one-time payment.    The step is another in the trend by railroads, including CSX Corp., Union Pacific Corp. and Burlington Northern Inc., to substantially reduce labor and other operating costs. The need to pare these costs has become acute as railroads struggle to compete with the trucking industry since transportation was deregulated in 1980.    Analysts said they believe Norfolk Southern, which has hefty coal shipments, had been under less pressure to cut its labor force. &quot;If anything Norfolk Southern has been slower than other railroads to get rid of excess labor,&quot; said Andras Petery, analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Norfolk Southern certainly is not leading; it's catching up,&quot; he added.    But Norfolk Southern, reflecting a downturn this year in its coal business, increasingly needs to cut costs. Having failed in its bid to buy the government's 85% interest in Consolidated Rail Corp. last year, Norfolk Southern is under less constraint in seeking work-force reductions.    &quot;When Norfolk Southern was wooing labor to support its bid for Conrail, it couldn't aggressively cut jobs,&quot; said Mr. Petery.    Norfolk's spokesman added that Norfolk Southern has been under less pressure than other railroads to pare employees because it has had one of the leanest work forces in the industry. He said the current severance program is designed to accelerate new national crew-reduction agreements that allow railroads to operate trains with fewer crew members.    In the past 12 months, Norfolk Southern has reduced its railroad work force to between 31,000 and 32,000 from 35,000 a year ago. In addition to the latest voluntary-severance offer to certain train-service workers, the company has made two severance offers to train engineers and recently sought to reduce its management ranks.    Citing &quot;declining rail business and forecasts that are less than promising,&quot; Norfolk Southern last month offered a voluntary early-retirement and severance program to about 1,100, or 20%, of its nonunion employees. The company has said it expects at least 600 management employees to accept the offer.    Norfolk Southern hasn't given details of the expected annual savings from its various voluntary-severance programs.    Norfolk shares jumped $1.75, to $37.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
