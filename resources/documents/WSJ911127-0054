In1986, he bought two lots on the Isle of Palms along SouthCarolina's beach front. He paid $975,000, planning to build ahouse for himself and one to sell. His investment disappearedin 1988 when a state agency declared he couldn't buildanything on his land, ever. The market value of his propertyfell to roughly $0.   The ban on new building will help stop beach erosion, butMr. Lucas wonders why he should have to bear the full costfor helping protect his neighbors' property. The SupremeCourt wonders, too, and last week agreed to hear his case.Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council could be JosephBiden's nightmare come true. Sen. Biden's first question tonominee Clarence Thomas was about constitutional protectionsfor private property. He told now-Justice Thomas that &quot;thesingle most important question you can be asked in thisentire hearing&quot; is if he really thought judges should enforcethe Constitution more vigorously to limit how legislatorsregulate private property and markets.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Lucas's case highlights the constitutional issue in anunusually stark way. A lower state court ruled that Mr. Lucassuffered the regulatory equivalent of Hurricane Hugo, totallydestroying his investment. The court said the rule deprivedhim of &quot;any reasonable economic use of the lots, haseliminated the unrestricted right of use, and renders themvalueless.&quot; It ordered the state to pay Mr. Lucas $1.2million as compensation.   The state Supreme Court, however, said Mr. Lucas shouldget no compensation, citing a state &quot;police power.&quot; Thisphrase does not occur in the Constitution, but the SupremeCourt has from time to time discovered a police-powerexception to the need to pay compensation. Yet as the PacificLegal Foundation noted in a friend-of-the-court brief for Mr.Lucas, this police-power argument rewrites the Constitutionto read, &quot;Nor shall private property be taken without justcompensation, unless for a public use.&quot;   Instead, as Justice Thomas reminded Sen. Biden, theTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is clear: &quot;Nor shallprivate property be taken for public use, without justcompensation.&quot; The Founders intended that (1) the governmentcan't take private property unless it is for a public use --such as avoiding beach erosion -- and then if and only if (2)the property owner is fully compensated for his own loss.   Sen. Biden knew that a rigorously enforced Takings Clausewould mean court-ordered deregulation. The Takings Clause, ifenforced, would stop endless debates about wetlands, timberinhabited by spotted owls, landmark designations and rentcontrol. All these could be regulated -- but only iftaxpayers decide it's worth compensating the owners, whowould have less reason to object.   For example, under current rules if you get a notice that,congratulations, your land has been designated a &quot;wetland,&quot;it's a disaster. The land can no longer be put to its highestvalue use, but the owner usually gets no compensation. The100 million acres now called wetlands reflect a loss ofbillions of dollars. Would voters want so many wetlands ifthey had to compensate the owners?   There has been a drag-out battle within the White Houseover the definition of a wetland, but the definition wouldmatter much less if owners were compensated. Likewise, NewYork City taxpayers probably could do without rent control ifit meant paying the owners of rent-controlled apartments thedifference between the regulated and market rents --especially since most tenants are middle class.   One sign that the justices plan to set out new rules torequire compensation is that they've also agreed this term tohear Yee v. Escondido. This appeal asks whether rent control,here applied to mobile-home lots, is a taking that requirescompensation to the owner. Former Judge Robert Bork will helpmake the case that compensation must be paid.   California Federal Appeals Court Judge Alex Kozinski ruledin a similar case this month that rent control does requirecompensation. The facts in the case make it easy to figureout how much compensation the market would require. A newmobile-home tenant paid $77,000 for a mobile home plus itsrent-controlled lot, then sold the home for $5,000. The ownerof the mobile-home park, not the previous tenant, should getthe $72,000 value of the lot.   As the justices have admitted, their precedents offer only&quot;open-ended and standardless&quot; rules for when compensationmust be paid. An owner of a mine didn't have to becompensated when regulations prohibited mining. The justicesdenied the owner of Grand Central Station compensation whenit was designated a landmark that couldn't be developed. Butthe court also said an owner of beach-front property had tobe compensated for granting the public access to the beach.   Sometimes courts try to distinguish &quot;regulatory takings&quot;that supposedly don't require compensation, and &quot;physicaltakings,&quot; which do. Yet Mr. Lucas's million-dollar taking byregulation cost him just as much as if the taking had been bytraditional eminent domain. There are some activities thatare unlawful nuisances -- such as polluting -- whereregulations don't require compensation, but building beachhouses is not a tort.   The Takings Clause has been a leading example of judicialfear of the unknown. Ever since the New Deal, federal andstate officials have violated private-property rights soregularly that judges might worry that they are poised atop aslippery slope. The result by now is that there are manyuncompensated takings in our economy, especially due toenvironmental regulations. If they order South Carolina togive Mr. Lucas his investment back, where will it end?   (The justices will also hear a case this term that couldresurrect the Contracts Clause, which protects privateagreements from government interference; more about this in alater column.)   It is no act of judicial activism for the justices torenew private-property rights. No other branch of governmentwill protect these civil rights. In 1988, President Reagandid sign an Executive Order defending private-property rightsand reminding officials of the Takings Clause, but federalagencies routinely ignore this Executive Order.   The justices might also note that Sen. Steve Symms,Republican of Idaho, proposed that the transportation billinclude an acknowledgment of the Takings Clause and codifyrecent Supreme Court cases that it's a taking even if somevalue remains in the regulated property. The takingsprovision was dumped from the bill yesterday in anotherreminder that politicians prefer to ignore this civil right.   The Takings Clause was intended to limit the reach of thegovernment into private property. It set out a simple rule.The government can take property for a public use, but onlyif taxpayers foot the bill. The justices need to remindpoliticians and regulators that the compensation requirementputs a limit on their ambitions.</TEXT></DOC>
