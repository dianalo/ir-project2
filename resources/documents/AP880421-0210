(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan said Thursday he is``very concerned'' that the Senate may not ratify the pendingU.S.-Soviet arms control treaty before he goes to Moscow for summittalks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   In a question-and-answer session after a speech to the WorldAffairs Council of Western Massachusetts, Reagan was asked by a lawstudent what the effect on the talks would be if the Senate had notyet ratified the treaty.   ``I think it would be very upsetting and would put a strain onthe summit if the Senate has not ratified the treaty by the time wego there,'' the president said.   ``We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of ithas been such that I am very concerned we may have to go withouthaving had it ratified,'' he said.   Replying to Reagan, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va., told a news conference he will not schedule the treaty fordebate until a dispute is resolved on whether or not the pact bansfuturistic weapons such as those using laser beams or particle rays.   He said this can be done only by attaching a reservation to thetreaty's resolution of ratification or by obtaining anauthoritative and binding commitment from the Soviets.   ``The date of the summit does not drive me at all and it shouldnot drive the Senate,'' Byrd said. ``This treaty is in a vacuum byitself and the Senate has to make a judgment ... Remember, we'redealing with the Soviet Union. I want to be sure all the I's aredotted and all the T's are crossed before the Senate acts onratification of this treaty.''   ``I want this treaty,'' Byrd said. ``I have no doubt it will beapproved at some point. But I want to be absolutely certain ourinterpretation (that the treaty bans medium-range futuristicweapons) is authoritative and documented by the Soviets as beingtheir interpretation and their commitment likewise.''   ``It isn't my fault that those who negotiated this treaty didn'tbring this issue into the procedings,'' Byrd said.   He said he has no objection of opening debate on the pact on May9, if the issue of futuristic weapons is resolved by then. But hesaid that once debate begins many amendments will be offered to thetreaty by opponents.   ``I don't know how much time it will take,'' Byrd said.   The pending treaty, covering intermediate and shorter-rangemissiles, was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their summitmeeting in Washington in December.   When the two leaders meet again in Moscow May 29 to June 2, oneof the issues confronting them will be a treaty still beingnegotiated that would cover longer-range intercontinental nuclearmissiles.   Of this treaty, Reagan said, ``There is a great question as towhether it could be ready for signature at the summit.''   ``We don't want a fast treaty,'' he said. ``We want a good one.''   On another issue, the president was asked about a trade billbeing considered on Capitol Hill. Reagan said that if it reacheshis desk in its present form, he will veto it.   He also said he would immediately ask Congress to enact a newbill that did not contain provisions to which the administrationobjects, including a requirement for companies to give workersnotice of plant closings.   In response to a question about the trade deficit, Reagan saidthat in the latest government report the deficit ``went up a littlebit. They didn't say a little bit _ they made it sound horrendous,something about around $13 billion plus in trade deficit. What theydidn't add was that exports had been at the highest level seen sofar.''   In his speech to the group, which was billed as a scene-setterfor the upcoming summit, Reagan proclaimed a ``period of realisticengagement'' between the United States and the Soviet Union.   ``Even while freedom is on the march, Soviet-American relationshave taken a dramatic turn, into a period of realisticengagement,'' Reagan said.   ``Two of the most basic rights that we have called on theSoviets to comply with,'' the president said, ``are the right toemigrate and the right to travel. How can we help but doubt agovernment that mistrusts its own people and holds them againsttheir will?   ``And what better way would there be to improve understandingbetween the United States and the Soviet Union than to permit freeand direct contact between our two peoples? In the new spirit ofopenness, why doesn't the Soviet government issue passports to itscitizens? I think this would dramatically improve U.S.-Sovietrelations.''   On Afghanistan, Reagan told his audience, ``Now the Soviets saythey have had enough.''   ``But let me say here that the next few momths will be no timefor complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves.The Soviets have rarely before _ and not at all in more than threedecades _ left a country, once occupied. They have often promisedto leave, but rarely in their history, and then only under pressurefrom the West, have they actually done it.''   Turning to the treaty on intercontinental missiles now beingnegotiated, which both sides have said they have some hopes ofsigning in Moscow, Reagan said that the treaty on medium andshorter-range missiles signed in December ``is reality and now theSenate should give it ratification.''   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters on theflight from Washington aboard Air Force One that ``we thinkeveryone wants to ratify the treaty before the summit. The impetusis for that to happen. It would be a shame if it did not happen. Wethink we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles tobe crossed.''</TEXT></DOC>
