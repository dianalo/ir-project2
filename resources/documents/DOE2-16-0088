Solar flux variations and the atmospheric nuclear testseries are also likely to have affected stratospheric ozone. In thisstudy, the LLNL two-dimensional chemical-radiative-transport model ofthe troposphere and stratosphere has been applied to an analysis of theeffects that these natural and anthropogenic influences may have hadon global ozone concentrations over the last three decades. In general,model determined species distributions and the derived ozone trends agreewell with published analyses of land-based and satellite-based observations.Also, the total ozone and ozone distribution trends derived from CFCand other trace gas effects have a different response with latitude thanthe derived trends from solar flux variations, thus providing a ``signature''for anthropogenic effects on ozone. 24 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
