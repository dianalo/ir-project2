Separately, the company said it is negotiating with its bank to restructure $31.5 million in loans. The restructuring negotiations contemplate a two-year revolving credit line followed by a four-year term loan, a spokesman said. The proposal is subject to Unit's reducing its borrowings outstanding by at least $15 million, which the company said it has proposed accomplishing through a stock offering. The company declined to elaborate further on terms of the proposed restructuring and wouldn't name the lender involved.    Unit said it was taking the write-down because of the poor outlook for the onshore contract drilling industry. In the year-ago second quarter, Unit had a net loss of $1.3 million on revenue of $5.4 million. The company declined to project revenue for the 1987 second quarter.    Unit contracts to drill oil and gas wells, develops and produces oil and gas properties, transports natural gas and processes natural gas liquids. </TEXT></DOC>
