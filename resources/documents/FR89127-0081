This extension/expansion of the current EUP issued undersection 5 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7U.S.C. 136(c), would include five additional sites in four additional Statesand would extend the permit from April 1989 to December 1989. This microbialpesticide is unique in that it actually lives within the treated crop plants.The Agency has determined that the application may be of regional and nationalsignificance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agencyis soliciting public comments on this application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments must be received on or before February27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments in triplicate, should bear number OPP-50675Aand be submitted to:<ITAG tagnum="15">Information Services Section, Program Management and Support Division(TS-767C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">In person bring comments to: Rm. 236, CMandplusmin;2, 1921 JeffersonDavis Highway, Arlington, VA. </ITAG>Information submitted in any comment(s) concerning this notice may be claimedconfidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``ConfidentialBusiness Information'' (CBI).

This EUP amendment wouldextend and expand the current EUP EPA File Symbol 58788-EUP-1. The proposedexperiment involves the endophytic bacterium <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subspecies <T3>cynodontis </T3>that has been genetically engineered to contain a delta-endotoxingene obtained from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>subspecies <T3>kurstaki.</T3> After inoculation, the endophytic bacterium grows withinthe corn plants and produces the pesticidal agent which is active againstthe larval stages of the European Corn Borer.The purpose of the EUP amendment is to further assess the efficacy of theproduct in control of the European Corn Borer on corn plants, study thecharacteristics of the recombinant organism in the environment, and evaluatethe effect of the organism on crop yield. CGI proposes to initiate thefield tests in the spring of 1989. The proposed field test sites are: Ingleside,Queen Anne's County Maryland (1 site); Beltsville Agricultural ResearchCenter, Prince Georges County, Maryland (1 site); Illiopolis, SangamonCounty, Illinois (1 site); Stanton, Goodhue County, Minnesota (1 site),Hastings, Clay County, Nebraska (2 sites); Hooper, Dodge County, Nebraska(1 site). The sites are each approximately 1 to 7 acres in size; all areisolated and secured. Each site will consist of: (1) A central corn plantpopulation arranged in blocks; (2) a plant-free barren zone containingplants to be monitored to detect dissemination of the test agent; (4) asecurity fence; and (5) a fallow zone surrounding the security fence. Studies to be performed on all sites will: (1) Determine <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis/Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>subsp. <T3>kurstaki </T3>recombinant levels in inoculated plants; (2) monitorany mechanical and natural spread of the recombinant organism to corn andother plant species; (3) monitor for the recombinant organism in plantresidues; (4) monitor for the presence of the recombinant organism in runoffwater and soil; and (5) compare yields of colonized and control corn plants.European Corn Borer control will be studied at each of the sites listedabove. As with the original EUP, the ARS-USDA cooperating scientists (at Beltsville)will examine the effects of recombinant colonization on: (1) Crop residuedecomposition; (2) vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae associations; and (3)gram negative phylloplane bacterial populations.  According to the applicant, test sites will be monitored until the recombinantorganism can no longer be detected in plant materials or soil. In the eventthat there is movement of the recombinant beyond the contained area, biocideswill be employed to the extent necessary for control. At the completionof the tests, all plant debris will be decontaminated. The labeling proposed by CGI that would govern the conduct of the experiment,states: Appliactors should ware protective clothing including goggles,dust mask, and gloves. Surfaces of planting equipment should be treatedwith 10% household bleach and wiped with paper towels after use. Disposeof unused material, paper towels, and rinse water by autoclaving or placein vessels containing 10% household bleach for disinfection prior to disposal.For use only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the EUP. Following the review of the CGI application and any comments received inresponse to this notice, EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUPamendment request for extension and expansion of the current EUP program,and if issued, the conditions under which it is to be conducted. Any issuanceof an EUP will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Anne Lindsay,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-1936 Filed 1-26-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
