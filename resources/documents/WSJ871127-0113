The Commerce Department's reports describe an economy behaving largely as expected before the Oct. 19 stock market crash: A revived industrial sector was driving economic growth, while consumer spending already had slowed in response to heavy debt burdens, among other factors.    However, many economists say consumer outlays may weaken markedly in the next few months as a result of a loss of wealth and confidence after the crash. They caution that additional data will be needed to gauge the effects of the market plunge.    &quot;The industrial sector was pushing ahead in October, and consumer spending was languid,&quot; Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said. &quot;Now we face the post-Oct. 19 future.&quot;    Consumer outlays were practically unchanged in October after falling a revised 0.3% in September. The September drop was originally reported as 0.5%. A decline in auto sales accounted for the October weakness; most other areas posted gains.    Personal income jumped 1.7% after a revised 0.6% gain in September that was originally reported as 0.7%. The surge was the largest since a 2.5% gain in July 1975 and matched the rise in July 1981. If unusual farm subsidy payments are excluded, however, income rose 0.7% in October.    The savings rate rose to 4.7% of aftertax income from 3% the month before.    Separately, the department said a rise in orders for aircraft and motor vehicles pushed new orders for major factory goods up 0.3% in October after a revised 2.4% increase in September. Previously, the September gain was put at 1.8%.    Analysts were impressed by the rise in orders for nondefense capital goods, which they said partly reflected stepped-up investment in response to rising exports. These orders, which are considered a good barometer of business investment generally, increased 0.6% after a revised 0.7% gain in September that was previously reported as a 0.3% drop.    James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, called the nondefense capital goods number &quot;wonderful,&quot; saying it adds to indications that the economy had considerable momentum going into the fourth quarter. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of third-quarter growth to 4.1% annually, adjusted for inflation.    Among major industries, transportation equipment posted the biggest rise, increasing 3.7% after a 2.5% drop. This was the first gain in this category since May. The biggest drop was in primary metals, which fell 4.1% after a 13.3% rise. Machinery orders were relatively flat in October, and military orders were unchanged after a 5.1% drop.    The October increase left orders for durable goods at $109.57 billion, compared with $109.27 billion in September. Shipments fell 0.3% to $108.1 billion after gaining 4.1% to $108.39 billion the previous month. The backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.4% to $383.28 billion after a 0.2% rise to $381.82 billion.    The spending report showed outlays fell last month for durable goods and rose for nondurable items and services. A spending-based price measure, reported after a one-month lag, rose 0.5% in September after a 0.4% increase in August.    Wages and salaries rose 0.7% last month after a 0.6% gain in September. Factory payrolls increased 0.5% after climbing 0.8%. Farm income, reflecting the subsidy payments, surged 90.7% last month after a 2.5% rise in September.    The October performance left spending at a $3.016 trillion annual rate. Income ran at a $3.841 trillion annual pace, compared with a $3.777 trillion rate a month earlier.    Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income. The figures are seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.                                        Oct.
