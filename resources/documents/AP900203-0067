Hundreds marched on the local police precinct Thursday night toprotest the shootings in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. OnFriday, residents remained angry.   ``People are tired of this,'' Manuel Vasquez, 38, said. ``We'resupposed to be more afraid of the criminals than the cops. It'sgetting not that way anymore.''   ``It's just murder, plain old murder,'' said one marcher at thedemonstration, where three people were arrested after rocks andbottles were thrown at police in riot gear.   Residents of Bushwick, which has one of the highest murder ratesin the city, have seen the number of people killed by police climbin recent years.   ``When they see you with gold, right away cops think you're adrug dealer,'' said George Ponce, 20, as he stood Friday acrossfrom the police precinct.   Ponce, along with others, talked about the death of 14-year-oldJose Louis Lebron, who was killed Wednesday in front of a candystore after he was shot behind the right ear by Officer FrankAlbergo.   A preliminary police investigation showed Albergo, who thoughthe saw Lebron reaching into his jacket for a weapon, acted ``withinpolice guidelines.'' Police have promised a thorough investigation.   Police said Lebron had robbed someone of $10.   Four days earlier and five blocks away, Louis Liranso, 17, wasshot in the back and killed by Officer Hyda Hernandez afterLiranso, who was unarmed, allegedly lowered his hands and turnedtoward the officer.   Hernandez has been suspended and a grand jury is examining thecase.   Residents mince no words about the shootings.   ``Killer cop Albergo,'' was painted on a blue badge on a wallnear the slaying scene.   And on the sidewalk where Lebron died were the words, ``Killedby a man in blue.''   But one officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saidLebron was a neighborhood tough who bullied others and was ``alwayson the street, hanging out and drinking.''   The Hispanic officer, who described walking the beat in Bushwickas ``wearing a uniform, standing around and hoping nothing goes onaround you,'' said local youths ``won't back down if they're withone another, not even to an officer.''   Lebron was the seventh person fatally shot by police in January;six of the shootings have occurred in Brooklyn. In 1989, 30 peoplewere killed by police; in 1988, 25 died and 14 died in 1987.   On Friday, police fatally shot a teen-ager carrying what turnedout to be an unloaded gun and 35 vials of crack after he attemptedto hold up a man, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman.Police shot Robert Cole, 13, as he approached officers and waswarned three times to drop his handgun, Vreeland said.   Lebron was recalled as a happy kid.   ``He was always smiling,'' said his 22-year-old brother, Ruben,wiping a tear from his cheek. ``He was the clown of the block. Ifthis tragedy happened to someone else, he'd make us laugh.''</TEXT></DOC>
