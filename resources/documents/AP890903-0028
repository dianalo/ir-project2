Today, it's on its back and federalregulators are wondering whether the traumatic tumble is symptomaticof broader problems in the nuclear industry.   One concern is that owners of some plants, dissatisfied with theprofit outlook in nuclear energy, are turning too much of theircorporate attention to other businesses _ sometimes taking onprojects far removed from the nuclear field.   Baltimore Gas andamp; Electric, which owns the Calvert Cliffs station,denies that its move into new enterprises in the early 1980s,including ownership of nursing homes, led to the nuclear plant'sdecline. It says complacency was its downfall, and that an infusionof new senior managers will put the plant back on track.   Whatever the reason, regulators are stunned that a nuclear plantlong considered one of the best in the business could suddenly dropto near the bottom of the heap.   Both of Calvert Cliff's nuclear reactors have been closed sinceMay because of mechanical problems. One may be restarted in October,the other next spring, although the utility must first get ago-ahead from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has had theplant under special surveillance since last winter.   Calvert Cliffs is not the only source of worry for regulators.Although the nuclear industry's overall record in safety andefficiency has been improving lately, the NRC is concerned thatsigns of trouble are cropping up unexpectedly at some plants.   They cite as examples the Surry plant owned by Virginia PowerCo., which last May was hit with a $500,000 fine for violatingNuclear Regulatory Commission rules _ one of the largest fines everimposed by the agency _ and the Salem plant of New Jersey's PublicService Electric and Gas, which in late August drew especially lowmarks in a regular NRC review of its operating performance.   One of the dilemmas facing regulators is determining when adropoff in performance at an individual plant may be serious enoughto force a shutdown. There are no clear guidelines for making thisjudgment, officials said.   The NRC now is mulling the case of the Turkey Point nuclearstation in south Florida, which has been ranked among the worstperformers for three straight years in the commission's biannualreview of operations at all 112 U.S. nuclear plants.   The commission has repeatedly criticized Turkey Point'sperformance, citing, among other things, unstable management byFlorida Power andamp; Light Co., the plant owner. Last June some NRCofficials suggested the commission might force Turkey Point to closeif it didn't show improvement by the end of the year.   Also, William Russell, administrator of the NRC's Northeastregional office, said recently he had ``a real concern'' that thereason for problems at the Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear plant, nearOswego, N.Y., was a ``diversion of attention'' by its owner, NiagaraMohawk Power Corp., to its financial troubles.   The most puzzling case, however, is Calvert Cliffs, which inAugust 1987 was inspected by a team from the International AtomicEnergy Agency and given a clean bill of health.   ``Calvert Cliffs is a good example of what is expected from awell managed and operated plant,'' the inspectors' report said,adding that ``no shortcomings in equipment, personnel and operatingpractices were found that would compromise safe operation.''   The report included some mild criticism of the plant'smaintenance and industrial safety training programs, but the overalljudgment was that Calvert Cliffs was above the average of nuclearplants inspected in other countries.   Then the trouble began. Last spring and summer, Calvert Cliffssuffered a series of mishaps and was fined by the NRC for violationsof safety regulations. The toughest blow, however, was anextraordinary incident last September in which a diver at the plantdrowned in a water storage tank after disregarding safety rules.   ``That shook them up; it shook us up,'' said Thomas Murley,director of the NRC's office of nuclear reactor regulation.   Three months later the plant was put on the NRC's list ofworst-run plants in the country, and this summer it was reaffirmedon the list.   ``Their fall from grace came so quickly and they fell so far,given the good performance that they'd had over the years,'' JamesCurtiss, a member of the NRC, said in a meeting with Baltimore Gas andamp;Electric officials in mid-August.   Murley says Calvert Cliffs had such a consistently good operatingrecord in the past that its own managers _ and federal regulators _may have become complacent.   ``They had a halo effect for years,'' he said.   Murley said he is confident that NRC methods of monitoringnuclear plant performance _ including special on-site audits aboutonce a year _ are adequate to ensure public safety. But some otherofficials have expressed doubt about whether NRC warnings to plantowners are enough to force improvements.   ``My problem with (yearly inspections) is they are so late,'' NRCChairman Kenneth Carr told a recent commission meeting. ``They comeout so long afterward, the guy can lull himself into saying, `Well,we fixed that... We are in better shape now.''</TEXT></DOC>
