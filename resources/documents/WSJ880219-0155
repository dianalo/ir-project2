International Molasses, a closely held molasses maker in West Orange, N.J., said it remains interested in Ingredient Technology. International Molasses and its affiliates own about 5.1% of the food ingredients maker. The group proposed the transaction late last month.    Ingredient Technology's shares closed yesterday at $17.625, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Ronald G. Targan, president of International Molasses, said: &quot;We're disappointed they turned it down out of hand. We had hoped to make this a friendly approach.&quot; But he added: &quot;We're still prepared to go forward, possibly unfriendly.&quot;    Ingredient Technology's board authorized the company, with the assistance of its financial adviser, Dillon, Read andamp; Co., to explore options for maximizing its value to shareholders.    The board also amended its shareholder rights' plan to defend against unwanted takeover bids.    &quot;We're taking a look at all alternatives, including restructuring, selling parts or all of the company -- whatever the combination or permutation of events results in a maximization of shareholder value,&quot; said James M. Harrison, vice president of finance at Ingredient Technology. </TEXT></DOC>
