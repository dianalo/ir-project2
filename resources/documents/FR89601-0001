Lewicki, (202) 447-2145.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposed rule detailing the increasesin the user fees charged for cotton classification, testing and standardswas published on April 17 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 15210). Pursuant to a correction publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 24, 1989, (54 FR 16438-T), a fifteenday comment period was provided for interested persons to respond to theproposed rule; no comments were received.Therefore, AMS is adopting without change these increases in user fees.This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be ``non-major''since it does not meet the criteria for a major regulatory action as statedin the order.The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certifiedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601<T3> et seq.</T3>) because: (1) The fee increases merely reflect a minimalincrease in the cost-per-unit currently borne by those entities utilizingthe services; (2) the cost increase will not affect competition in themarketplace; (3) the use of classification and testing services and thepurchase of standards is voluntary.The information collection requirements contained in this final rule havebeen previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assignedOMB control numbers under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="85">Fees for the Classification Under the Cotton Statistics and EstimatesAct of 1927</ITAG>The user fee charged to cotton producers for manual classification servicesunder the Smith-Doxey amendment to the Cotton Statistics and EstimatesAct (7 U.S.C. 473a) was $1.03 during the 1988 harvest season (53 FR 20089)as determined using the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton ClassingFees Act of 1987. The charges cover salaries, cost of equipment and supplies,and other overhead and include administrative and supervisory costs. Thisfinal rule increases the user fee for manual classification charged toproducers from $1.03 per bale to $1.23 per bale. This new fee was calculatedby using the 1988 base fee adjusted for the rate of inflation, the projectedsize of the crop and the addition of a surcharge necessary to maintainan adequate operating reserve. The 1988 base fee is $1.15 per bale. A 4.1percent, or five cents per bale, increase due to the Implicit Price Deflatorof the Gross National Product is added to the $1.15 resulting in a 1989base fee of $1.20 per bale. The 1989 crop is currently estimated at 12,700,000running bales. The base fee is decreased two percent based on the estimatedsize of the crop (one percent for every 100,000 bales or portion thereofabove the base of 12,500,000 bales). This percentage factor amounts toa two cents per bale reduction and is subtracted from the base fee of $1.20per bale resulting in a fee of $1.18 per bale. A five-cent surcharge isadded to the $1.18 per bale fee since the projected operating reserve isless than 25 percent. The projected operating reserve is 16 percent. Thiswould establish the 1989 season fee at $1.23 per bale. No further adjustmentsare warranted under the formula.Therefore, the fee for this service in andSection;28.909 during the 1989harvest season is $1.23 per bale. The additional fee for High Volume Instrument(HVI) classification remains 50 cents per bale and the fee for HVI classificationduring the 1989 harvest season is revised to $1.73 per bale. As providedfor in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, a 5 cent per balediscount continues to be applied to voluntary centralized billing and collectingagents.The fee for a manual review classification in andSection;28.911 is also increasedfrom $1.03 to $1.23 per bale since the fee for review classification isthe same as the original classification fee. For the same reason the feefor HVI review classification is increased from $1.53 to $1.73 per bale.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fees for Cotton Standards</ITAG>Practical forms of the cotton standards are prepared and sold by the CottonDivision offices in Memphis, Tennessee, under the authority of the UnitedStates Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 51 <T3>et seq</T3>.). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub.L. 97-35) directs that the price for standards will cover, as nearly aspracticable, the costs of providing the standards.This final rule increases the fees listed in andSection;andSection;28.123 and28.151 for practical forms of the cotton standards, including both gradeand staple standards for American Upland cotton, American Pima cotton andfor cotton linters. The fees need to be adjusted due to increased costsfor salaries and preparation, delivery, and postage of the standards. Currentand estimated demand for the standards has also been factored into thefee revision since per unit costs are directly related to volume.The fees for American Upland cotton grade standards are increased from$100.00 to $110.00 f.o.b. Memphis, Tennessee, or overseas air freight collect.The price is increased from $104.00 to $114.00 for domestic surface deliveryand from $140.00 to $150.00 for overseas air parcel post delivered. Thefees for American Upland staple standards f.o.b. Memphis and overseas airfreightcollect increase from $14.00 to $16.00. The domestic surface deliveredfee increases from $16.00 to $18.00 and the overseas air parcel post deliveredfee increases from $28.00 to $30.00. The fees for American Pima grade standardsare increased from $126.00 to $140.00 f.o.b. Memphis or overseas air freightcollect. The price is increased from $130.00 to $144.00 for domestic surfacedelivered and from $166.00 to $180.00 for overseas air parcel post delivered.Fees for American Pima staple standards increase from $15.00 to $17.00for f.o.b. Memphis and overseas air freight collect. The domestic surfacedelivered fee increased from $17.00 to $19.00 and the overseas air parcelpost delivered fee increases from $29.00 to $31.00. The fees for lintersgrade standards are increased from $100.00 to $110.00 f.o.b. Memphis oroverseas air freight collect. The price for domestic surface delivery increasesfrom $104.00 to $114.00 and the price for overseas air parcel post deliveryincreases from $140.00 to $150.00. The f.o.b. Memphis or overseas air freightcollect fees for linters staple standards increases from $16.00 to $18.00.The delivered price increases from $18.00 to $20.00 for domestic and from$30.00 to $32.00 for overseas air parcel post. <ITAG tagnum="85">Fees for Classification Services Under the United States Cotton StandardsAct </ITAG>Certain other cotton classification services are conducted under the UnitedStates Cotton Standards Act. Fees for these services have been reviewed.In order to recover increased costs, including supervision and overhead,the fees for classification of cotton or samples in andSection; 28.116 areincreased: For grade, staple and micronaire readings from $1.30 per sampleto $1.45; for grade and staple only from $1.15 per sample to $1.25; andfor grade only or staple only from $.90 to $1.00. The fee in andSection; 28.117 for each new memorandum or certificate issuedin substitution for a prior one increases from $4.00 per sheet to $4.50.The additional hourly fee charged for Form C determinations in andSection;andSection;28.120 and 28.149 increases from $18.00 per hour or each portion thereofto $20.00 per hour, or each portion thereof, plus traveling expenses andsubsistence or per diem. The fee in andSection; 28.122 for a complete practicalclassing examination for cotton or cotton linters increases from $125.00to $135.00 and the fee for reexamination for a failed part, either gradeor staple, increases from $75.00 to $80.00. Fees for the classification,comparison, or review of linters in andSection; 28.148 increases from $1.20to $1.30 per bale or sample involved. In andSection; 28.148, the fee forclassification or comparison of cotton linters and the issuance of a memorandumincreases from $1.20 to $1.30 per sample. The United States Cotton Futures Act (7 U.S.C. 15b) authorizes the Secretaryto make such regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions ofthat Act. Pursuant to that authority, Part 27 of the regulations (7 CFRPart 27) provides for cotton classification under the Cotton Futures Actincluding fees to recover the costs of classification and micronaire. Underthis final rule, the fees charged for the services are increased to coverthe costs of providing such services, including overhead costs. These fees have been reviewed and the fees in andSection; 27.80 for initialclassification is increased from $1.20 per bale to $1.30 per bale; thefee for review classification is increased from $1.40 per bale to $1.50per bale. All supervision fees are increased by 20 cents. Pursuant to andSection;27.85, fees for withdrawal of requests or applications for review, aftersuch services have been started, are the same as the fees in andSection;27.80 for services completed, so such charges are increases by this rule.Fees for certificates which appear in andSection; 27.81 increases from 60cents to 65 cents per certificate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Testing Services</ITAG>Cotton testing services are provided by USDA Laboratory in Clemson, SouthCarolina under the authority of the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Actof 1927 (7 U.S.C. 471-478). The tests are available, upon request, to privatesources on a fee basis. The Cotton Services Testing Amendment (7 U.S.C.473d) specifies that the fees for the services be reasonable and coveras nearly as practicable the costs of rendering the services. The costof providing these services has increased since the last fee increase in1987 due to higher costs for salaries and miscellaneous overhead costsincluding supplies and materials. Therefore, the fees for cotton testingservices are increased to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costsof these services. The fees for fiber and processing tests in andSection; 28.956, except items1.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 9.0, 15.0, 18.0, and 19.0, are increasedas follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10,10</C> <H1>Item No. </H1><H1>Fee </H1><H2>Current </H2><H2>Proposed</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1.0a <D>84.00 </D><D>84.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.0b <D>88.00 </D><D>88.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.0c <D>84.00 </D><D>84.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.0d <D>124.00 </D><D>124.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.0a <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.0b <D>16.00 </D><D>18.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.0c <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.0d <D>25.00 </D><D>27.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.1a <D>23.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.1b <D>25.00 </D><D>27.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.1c <D>23.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.1d <D>37.00 </D><D>39.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3.0 <D>95.00 </D><D>105.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3.1 <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4.0 <D>25.00 </D><D>30.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4.1 <D>12.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5.0 <D>1.60 </D><D>1.60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6.0 <D>1.08 </D><D>1.10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.0 <D>8.50 </D><D>8.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.1 <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.0 <D>8.75 </D><D>8.75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.1 <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9.0a <D>8.75 </D><D>8.75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9.0b <D>6.50 </D><D>6.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9.0c <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.0 <D>0.55 </D><D>0.65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.1 <D>0.30 </D><D>0.35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11.0 <D>10.00 </D><D>12.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>50.00 </D><D>60.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12.0 <D>6.00 </D><D>6.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.0a <D>65.00 </D><D>70.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.0b <D>103.00 </D><D>108.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.0c <D>125.00 </D><D>130.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.1a <D>48.00 </D><D>52.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.1b <D>70.00 </D><D>74.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.1c <D>97.00 </D><D>101.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.2 <D>117.00 </D><D>122.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14.0a <D>22.00 </D><D>24.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14.0b <D>27.00 </D><D>29.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14.0c <D>32.00 </D><D>34.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15.0a <D>7.50 </D><D>7.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15.0b <D>13.00 </D><D>13.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16.0 <D>14.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">17.0 <D>4.50 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>22.50 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18.0 <D>25.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">19.0 <D>80.00 </D><D>80.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.0 <D>105.00 </D><D>110.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.1 <D>80.00 </D><D>85.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21.0<D>95.00</D><D>100.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22.0 <D>140.00 </D><D>145.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">23.0 <D>200.00 </D><D>210.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24.0 <D>220.00 </D><D>230.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25.0 <D>29.00 </D><D>31.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25.1 <D>40.00 </D><D>42.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26.0a <D>75.00 </D><D>80.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26.0b <D>22.00 </D><D>23.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27.0 <D>11.00 </D><D>12.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28.0 <D>4.50 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28.1 <D>6.50 </D><D>7.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29.0 <D>17.00 </D><D>18.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29.1 <D>29.00 </D><D>31.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30.0 <D>12.00 </D><D>14.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>36.00 </D><D>42.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31.0 <D>2.50 </D><D>3.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32.0 <D>3.00 </D><D>3.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33.0 <D>1.10 </D><D>1.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33.1 <D>12.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 27Cotton, Classification, Samples, Micronaire, Spot markets.7 CFR Part 28  Cotton samples, Standards, Cotton linters, Grades, Staples, Market news,Testing.
