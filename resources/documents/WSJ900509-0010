Separately, LIN, which until January had little debt,definitively agreed to acquire Metromedia Inc.'s cellularoperations in New York for $1.9 billion in cash and preferredstock. The deal will add more than $1 billion in debt toLIN's balance sheet.</LP><TEXT>   The severance payments, which, as expected, include morethan $200 million to Donald Pels, LIN's former chairman, stemfrom BF McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.'s acquisition of52% of LIN.   To cover the costs, LIN took a $292.9 million charge,which also included payments to other executives andundisclosed fees to its banking and legal advisers on theMcCaw transaction. LIN declined to disclose the exact amountit paid to Mr. Pels, but it covered a pre-negotiatedseverance package that he had with LIN. It also covered thebuy-out of 1.3 million stock options he held in the companyas part of the agreement with McCaw.   Donald Guthrie, a vice president at LIN and a senior vicepresident at McCaw, declined to disclose the amount of theseverance payments to the LIN executives, who included ArnoldBlauweis, former vice president, finance; Michael Plouf,former treasurer and vice president, corporate development;and Ronald Graiff, former vice president, engineering.   Mr. Guthrie also declined to specify the amount paid toLIN's banking advisers, Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., and itslegal counsel, Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore.   In the quarter, LIN's loss equaled $3.50 a share, vs. netincome of $20.2 million, or 38 cents a share, in theyear-earlier period. Without the charge, LIN would haveearned $22.8 million, or 44 cents a share. Revenue grew 17%to $61.7 million from $52.9 million.   In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares closed at$64.50, unchanged.   LIN's first-quarter loss follows a $15 millionfourth-quarter loss, after LIN paid BellSouth Corp. $66.5million for terminating an agreement to be acquired by theAtlanta-based regional Bell phone company.   The Metromedia deal was proposed as all-cash. Butyesterday, LIN said it will pay Metromedia $1.05 billion incash for its New York cellular properties, to be funded byadditional debt. Metromedia will also get $850 million in newredeemable preferred stock in a LIN subsidiary, LCH CellularInc. LCH now holds all the LIN cellular subsidiaries and itsWOTV television station in Michigan as well as publishingproperties. In addition, LIN will pay $60 million to minorityholders of 1.7% of the New York license.   LIN also agreed to transfer 1.01% of its controllinginterest in a Philadelphia cellular franchise to Metromediafor $15.5 million. This will give Metromedia 51% control ofthe franchise and leave LIN as the minority owner at 49%.   LIN said its base of cellular phone subscribers grew 59%in the quarter to 413,000 from 260,000 a year earlier. KenLeon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., noted that LIN'ssubscriber growth between the fourth quarter of 1989 and thefirst quarter of 1990 was 12% vs. the industry average of15%.   &quot;It's a quality company on an operating basis,&quot; said Mr.Leon. But given its subscriber growth and debt load, &quot;I thinkLIN is a real crapshoot.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
