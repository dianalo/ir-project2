The measure cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's $4.9 billion requestfor spending on the SDI program, or Star Wars, in the fiscal yearthat began Oct. 1.   Bush, in a statement, said the measure would provide sufficientfunds to ``provide a national defense sufficient to meetforeseeable threats to the national security'' in the coming year.   In signing the bill, Bush voiced reservations over severalprovisions, including one calling on him to persuade NATO partnersto increase their active-duty forces in Europe.   He also criticized a section urging him to seek a Japaneseagreement to offset U.S. costs of deploying forces to defend Japan.   He said both provisions ``derogate from the president'sauthority'' under the Constitution.   Bush also took issue with a section requiring him to report toCongress on any negotiations with U.S. allies on the StrategicDefense Initiative, claiming it could compromise his authority tocontrol sensitive national defense information.   He suggested he might ignore this section, as well as someothers he claimed infringed on his constitutional powers.   The legislation represents the first cut in the SDI program insix years.   The bill also trimmed his request for other major strategicprograms such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2stealth bomber.   Congress adopted a series of provisions intended to press U.S.allies into accepting a greater share of the defense burden.   One amendment calls on Japan to boost defense and foreign aidspending and requires the president to negotiate an agreementproviding for Japan to completely offset the costs of maintainingU.S. forces to defend Japanese territory.   A third directs the president to prepare a five-year plan forthe U.S. military presence in South Korea, including a discussionof the feasibility of a reduction in U.S. military personnelstationed in the Asian nation.   The legislation also reduces the ceiling on the number of U.S.troops overseas by about 15,000. Those troops were associated withintermediate-range nuclear weapons, which were banned by aU.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1988.   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, officials said they now estimatethat the effect of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law coveringfiscal 1990 means a $1.7 billion cut for the agency's spending.   A Pentagon spokesman, Jim Turner, said it wasn't immediatelyclear what the effect of the cuts would be or how they would affectmanpower decisions.   Turner said the number was a ``preliminary estimate'' pendingformal notification from the Office of Management and Budget.   ``We're still trying to figure out how its all going to fall,''Turner said.</TEXT></DOC>
