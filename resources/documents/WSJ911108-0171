Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., after three years of research,says it will introduce a tire with a &quot;built-in brain&quot; thatwill &quot;talk to its owner about how it is doing.&quot; Does thismean the Akron, Ohio, tire maker has devised a gizmo thatwill alert drivers if they have missed a turn, or scold themfor passing on the right?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They're smart, but not that smart,&quot; confesses Bryan L.Kinnamon, Goodyear's general manager for truck tires. But headds that the tires may someday warn drivers not to speed ortell them the road is slippery. The tires may also helpcompanies monitor their trucks' whereabouts. Goodyear saysthe technology is similar to that used by European farmers tokeep track of their pigs, which are implanted with computerchips at birth.   Goodyear will introduce the tires for trucks by early1993, and it is devising similar talking models forairplanes, buses, construction equipment and passenger cars.&quot;This is a major project,&quot; says Mr. Kinnamon, who predicts&quot;there will be a smart tire in every garage.&quot; Goodyearbelieves trucking companies will require the new tires, whichwill expand the average five-year tire lifespan by improvingmaintenance, for all trucks within five years.   The brains, which will add no more than $20 to the priceof a $300 truck tire, consist of a computer chip with sensorsinstalled in a &quot;smart patch of rubber&quot; in the tire. Earlyversions will allow a driver or maintenance worker toidentify tires and trace their histories. Later models willdirectly communicate such data as tire pressure, temperatureand mileage to the driver and to a central operator via acomputer on board the truck.   Goodyear has taken precautions so that tires communicatewith the driver on different frequencies from each other.That prevents tires from giving conflicting advice orbickering among themselves. &quot;The tire has been given apersonality,&quot; a Goodyear spokesman says.   Goodyear's talking tires are one of the latest attempts bytire makers to distinguish their products from other tiresand thus to escape the price wars. Groupe Michelin reportsbrisk sales of its new XH4 tire, which is designed to last80,000 miles. Bridgestone Corp. plans to unveil aflat-resisting tire that runs even when losing air pressure.And Goodyear has been trumpeting its Aquatred tire, whichreduces hydroplaning with a new double-tread design.   Truckers, though, are cautious in their reaction to thelatest innovation. &quot;It would be useful as long as it'smonitoring the tire itself and not telling me what to do,&quot;says Doris Harris, a trucker at Sapp Brothers' truck stop onInterstate 80 outside Omaha, Neb. Even if the tire startedtelling her to slow down, Ms. Harris says, &quot;I'd probablyignore it anyway.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
