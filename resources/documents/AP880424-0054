Milken, the king of junk bondfinancing, appears before a congressional committee this week, morewill be on members' minds than the role of high-risk, high-yieldbonds in the nation's economy.   Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is a pioneer in the use ofso-called junk bonds in corporate takeovers and also a key figurein the government's investigation into Wall Street's insidertrading scandal. He would be the first central player in theinsider trading scandal to testify in public.   A staff member for the House Energy and Commerce subcommitteesaid the panel has steered clear of attempting to learn thedirection of insider trading probes by the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.   ``We've done that deliberately so Drexel could not say at alater date that we were using the congressional process to squeezethem,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Because of that, the aide said, problems associated with junkbond financing, not insider trading, will be the focus of thisweek's hearings.   Even so, Milken's attorneys have indicated to the subcommittee``there is a good chance he will claim the Fifth Amendment,'' thestaffer said.   Drexel disclosed in February that the SEC had notified the firmthat its staff planned to recommend civil charges against the firmand some of its employees for securities law violations. The firmhas repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   Since the indictment nearly a year and a half ago of speculatorIvan Boesky, members of Congress have been hungry for news aboutthe progress or lack of progress in the SEC probe.   They've gotten little to allay their curiosity. Last May, JohnShad, then SEC chairman, told senators they could expect to see``succession of shoes dropping through the summer.''   No shoes fell, and in December, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking subcommittee on securities,pressed Shad's successor, David S. Ruder, for an explanation.   Ruder said he expected additional ``major cases,'' but said thecases were ``exceedingly complicated'' and their completion monthsaway.   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on investigations,which subpoenaed Milken to appear Wednesday, has also beenexamining the insider-trading scandal. Drexel chief executiveFrederick Joseph is scheduled to appear Thursday.   The investigations subcommittee met behind closed doors lastJune to hear from Dennis B. Levine, a merger specialist at Drexelwho was convicted of securities fraud and is now serving a sentenceat federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa.   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee and its investigations subcommittee, has said healso would like to call Boesky, who is in federal prison at Lompoc,Calif.   Milken is the architect of Drexel's pioneering Beverly Hills,Calif.,-based business in junk bonds, which have been frequentlyused to help finance corporate takeovers like those in which Boeskyspeculated.   Critics of corporate takeovers maintain that the buildup ofthinly secured debt is dangerous to the economy.   Meanwhile, concern in the Senate about the SEC investigation hasnot gone away.   Riegle, in December, had asked for a letter from Ruder on thestatus of the probe and received what a Senate staff member, whospoke on condition of anonymity, described as a ``pro forma''response.   The aide said Senate Banking Committee Chairman WilliamProxmire, D-Wis., is also anxious to see results.   ``I think Proxmire will probably wait until the end of thesummer and then ... seek some satisfaction why this investigationis taking so long. We won't drop the ball, but at the same time wehave a lot of confidence in the SEC and the prosecutor's office inNew York,'' the aide said.</TEXT></DOC>
