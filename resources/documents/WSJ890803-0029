The 259-169 roll call came on a larger procedural resolution, but the impact was to automatically attach the ban to a nearly $12 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill pending in the chamber. The size of the vote was interpreted as a strong endorsement of the current restriction due to expire next April, and proponents said they were confident the ban would become permanent law.    Tobacco interests appeared resigned to the same conclusion and, though their support is stronger in the Senate, the industry has fallen back to a position of fighting any expansion of the ban to flights longer than two hours.    Yesterday's vote was clouded by unrelated procedural issues, but the size of the margin is far larger than the narrow five-vote victory two years ago when the current restrictions were first adopted by the House. </TEXT></DOC>
