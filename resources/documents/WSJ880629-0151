The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said yesterday that shipments abroad of cars, trucks, buses and mini-vehicles fell 9.2% in May from a year earlier and 17.5% from the prior month, to 482,638 units, dragged down largely by a continuing decline in exports to the U.S. Separately, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said steel exports declined 5.2% in May from the year before and 0.1% from April, to 1,961,000 metric tons. On a year-to-year basis, steel exports have fallen every month since September 1986.    In the third report, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said export contracts concluded by 17 major trading companies fell 9.8% in May from a year earlier. The houses account for about 50% of the nation's exports, and the council's statistics provide an indication of Japan's short-term trade trends.    Japan's exports have been badly hurt by the strong yen, but the nation's economy has boomed because of a surge in domestic demand. In an indication of that domestic strength, the Economic Planning Agency said that its leading indicator of the economy stood at 54.5 in April, up from 53.8 in March. A reading above 50 indicates continuing economic expansion, while that below 50 signals a contraction.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said sales at major Japanese retail outlets rose 7.2% in May from a year earlier, underscoring the Japanese consumer's role in the economic expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
