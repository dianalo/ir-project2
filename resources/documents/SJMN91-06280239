It's really quite agood ending, giving Scarlett an ironic comeuppance. But it's the sort ofdilemma that occurs in the middle chapters of most of the books that haveimitated &quot;GWTW.&quot;;   There was bound to be a sequel eventually: The copyrighton &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; expires in 2011. The owners of the copyright, theheirs to Mitchell's estate, figured they'd better cash in before the bookwinds up in public domain and everyone can get their hands on Mitchell'scharacters. So they hired Alexandra Ripley, the author of such ersatz &quot;GWTW&quot;clones as &quot;Charleston&quot; and &quot;New Orleans Legacy,&quot; to produce the officialsequel.;   Catching the wind; Now, I'm not one of those who think Ripley isdesecrating graves and violating temples by cobbling up a sequel to &quot;Gone Withthe Wind.&quot; Margaret Mitchell's book is a good read, with an epic conflict inthe background and a romantic dilemma in the foreground. It's terrific popfiction. But is it anything more than that?;   It has long had admirers whothink it is. Darden Asbury Pyron, a history professor at Florida InternationalUniversity, is one of them. His new biography of Mitchell is a doggedlydutiful attempt to take Mitchell seriously as a writer. He digs tirelesslyinto her family history for the roots of the novel, and explores her childhoodwriting and her work as an Atlanta journalist as if they bore the seeds ofgenius. He combs &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; for themes and motifs related toMitchell's life: Among other things, he says, the book is about therelationship of mothers and daughters, Ellen and Scarlett, Scarlett andBonnie, Grandmother Robillard and Ellen, Mammy and Scarlett, Dilcey andPrissy. So naturally he finds the model for Rhett Butler in Mitchell'smother.;   Pyron's biography is occasionally provocative, and it may well bethe definitive account of the novel's origins. On the other hand, it's morethan a little sloppy in some details: Pyron refers to the senator from SouthCarolina as &quot;Strom Thurman&quot; -- it's Thurmond -- and to the novella by OscarWilde as &quot;A Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; -- it's &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray.&quot;Mainly, it's a book for &quot;GWTW&quot; fanatics -- of which, to judge only from thesales of &quot;Scarlett,&quot; there seem to be millions -- and not for the generalreader or the skeptic.;   I side with the skeptics about the status of &quot;GWTW&quot;as literature, and particularly with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose critique ofthe novel is quoted in Pyron's book: &quot;There are no new characters, newtechniques, new observations -- none of the elements that make literature --especially no new examination into human emotions,&quot; Fitzgerald wrote. &quot;But onthe other hand it is interesting, surprisingly honest, consistent andworkmanlike throughout, and I felt no contempt for it but only a certain pityfor those who consider it the supreme achievement of the human mind.&quot;;   Toanswer the first of those questions at the top of this review: No one is goingto consider &quot;Scarlett&quot; the supreme achievement of the human mind. A lot ofpeople are going to feel contempt for it.;   More than romance; &quot;Gone With theWind&quot; was driven by Margaret Mitchell's desire to tell a story. She hadsomething to say, even if some of it was nonsense, about the effects of theCivil War and Reconstruction on a generation of upper-class Georgians. ForMitchell, history wasn't just something to wrap the romance in. And she reallywasn't interested in whether Scarlett got Rhett. Pyron suggests that sheoriginally planned to end the novel with Rhett's &quot;I don't give a damn,&quot; as ifMitchell herself didn't give a damn about what Scarlett would do.;  Unfortunately, that's the only thing Ripley is interested in -- aside from,obviously, money. Her whole sequel is about Scarlett's obsession with Rhett.Ripley dutifully tries to work in some history by packing Scarlett off toIreland at the height of the Fenian movement and Parnell's crusade for HomeRule, but she's not really interested in it. It's only a plot mechanism.;  Not that &quot;Scarlett&quot; has a plot. Instead, it just has a lot of incidents:Scarlett pursues Rhett to Charleston. Scarlett conquers Charleston society.Scarlett and Rhett nearly drown. They make love. He leaves. Scarlett goes toSavannah and meets her O'Hara cousins. Scarlett goes to Ireland with guns forthe Fenians packed among her petticoats. Rhett divorces her and remarries.Scarlett buys and restores an Irish estate. Scarlett has Rhett's baby.Scarlett conquers Anglo-Irish society. Ashley proposes and Scarlett turns himdown. Scarlett gets engaged to a wicked lord. The peasants attack Scarlett'smansion . . .;   Paid by the word?; Outlined like that, &quot;Scarlett&quot; may soundlike a promising page-turner. But it isn't; these incidents are dragged outover 823 tedious pages. Even though she'll rake in her share of the $4.7million Warner Books paid for the rights to &quot;Scarlett,&quot; Ripley writes as ifshe's being paid by the word: &quot;He opened the door to the street. Before shecould say a word, he was gone. The door swung slowly closed behind him.&quot; Ittakes her 200 pages to wrap up all the loose ends and straggling charactersfrom &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Then it's off to Charleston, and a whole new set ofcharacters, most of whom disappear after 100 pages, when Scarlett moves on toSavannah and another hundred pages of mostly irrelevant incident. The book ishalf over before Scarlett gets to Ireland, where the real story begins. Bythat time, most readers won't give a damn, either.;   Furthermore, Ripley hasundermined her central character. Mitchell's Scarlett may have been a bitch,but she was never a bore. Ripley's Scarlett ceases to be a bitch: In Ireland,she becomes &quot;The O'Hara of Ballyhara&quot;; everyone loves her; she loves herchild; she gives up wearing corsets! She becomes a colossal bore.;   Part ofthe problem is that Ripley has no one to play her off against. According tothe flackery, Ripley reread &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; six times in preparation forher sequel. She would have done better to read Fielding and Jane Austen,Dickens and Thackeray, and learn from them, as Mitchell certainly did, thatnovels need plot and characters need foils. In &quot;GWTW&quot; Melanie's virtue andselflessness highlighted Scarlett's pragmatism and egocentricity. Mammy wasScarlett's Jiminy Cricket-style conscience. The other servants, such as Porkand Dilcey and Uncle Peter, as well as the neighbors at Tara and in Atlanta,served as a chorus, their judgment of Scarlett sometimes ironically differingfrom our own. Even Belle Watling, the whore with a heart of gold, served toreveal Scarlett's heart of ice. Stock characters all, but Mitchell uses themwell.;   Dropped characters, missed chances; Ripley fumbles all of this.Melanie is dead, and Ripley provides no one else as a norm against whichScarlett's behavior may be judged. She kills off Mammy on Page 25 and sendsPrissy, Pork, Dilcey and Uncle Peter into retirement. She never bothers toaccount for Belle Watling, despite Belle's well-established relationship withRhett and hints in Mitchell's book that they may have had a child. Instead,Ripley wastes pages on Tony Fontaine, a minor character from the first bookwho seems to be a potential suitor for Scarlett until he disappearscompletely.;   Is there anything to be said for &quot;Scarlett&quot;? I suppose onecould praise Ripley for eliminating the racism that mars &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;Mitchell never presents slavery as an evil; she seems to think of it as anexcellent system for training servants. She regarded blacks as at bestchildlike noble savages. But she did create memorable black characters, whoserve her plot well. Ripley avoids charges of racism by eliminating all blackcharacters except Scarlett's servant, a new character named Pansy, who seemsto be there because Scarlett has to have a maid -- and perhaps because Ripleycouldn't resist a joke: In Mitchell's manuscript, Scarlett was initially PansyO'Hara.;   On the other hand, Ripley's novel is full of Irish characters whoare nearly as offensively stereotyped as Mitchell's blacks: They're arelentlessly cheery but occasionally hot-tempered lot who do little but sing&quot;The Wearing o' the Green&quot; and dance reels and blather endlessly aboutleprechauns and banshees.;   No one expected &quot;Scarlett&quot; to be as good as &quot;GoneWith the Wind.&quot; But it could have been fun; it could have been exciting; itcould have made you laugh and cry. But Ripley's book just slogs from itslugubrious beginning, Melanie's funeral, to its ludicrous ending, wherein, toanswer the other question, yes, she gets him. Frankly . . .
