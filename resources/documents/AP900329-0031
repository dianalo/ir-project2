The Environmental Protection Agency needs to step up itsregulation of lawn care chemicals, the General Accounting Officesaid in a report to a Senate committee on Wednesday.   Another Senate panel was told the United States should ban theexport of agricultural pesticides that are not permitted for use inthis country.   The import of produce sprayed with these chemicals is a ``circleof poison,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the SenateAgriculture Committee.   The GAO report released by the Senate Environment and PublicWorks Committee followed a 1986 study that found the EPA had madelittle progress assessing the health risks of lawn care pesticides.The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.   The earlier report said the EPA had taken little enforcementaction against advertising claims made by the pesticide industry.   Peter Guerrero, the GAO's associate director for environmentalprotection issues, said the new report shows the EPA still has moreto do.   ``We also found that prohibited pesticide claims that EPAclassifies as false and misleading are still being made by the lawncare pesticides industry,'' he said. ``Yet, EPA has taken evenfewer formal enforcement actions in recent years than it did duringthe 1984 and 1985 period we reviewed for our earlier report.''   One of the most popular chemicals, diazinon, was disallowed foruse on golf courses and sod farms because it killed waterfowl andother birds.   After several people were poisoned by diazinon, the EPA requiredspecial warnings on its label and said only certified applicatorscould use it commercially.   But Guerrero said the restriction does not apply to commerciallawn care companies and homeowners.   A spokesman for the EPA said migratory birds that fed on golfcourses were dying, but the agency doesn't have similar evidenceagainst diazinon for birds that light in people's yards.   ``The law says you have to prove a substance has reasonableadverse effects before you can take it off the market,'' said AlHeier, the spokesman for EPA.   In the Senate Agriculture Committee, witnesses testified on abill that would stop U.S. companies from exporting agriculturalchemicals that are banned in the United States.   ``One fourth of the produce we eat is imported,'' said Leahy.``That's 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man, womanand child.''   An agriculture official from Ecuador supported the bill, sayingher country, ``like many developing countries, is not in thecondition to guarantee that highly toxic pesticides will be used ineven a relatively safe manner.''   Mercedes Bolanos de Moreno, chief of Ecuador's plant protectionprogram, said her country has no national pesticide policy. TheUnited States buys large amounts of bananas, coffee, cocoa andsugar from Ecuador.   In the last two years, federal inspectors have found U.S.-bannedpesticides in beef from Honduras, pineapples from the Philippinesand beans and carrots from Latin America.   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural ChemicalsAssociation, defended the industry in testimony at both hearings.   ``Some pesticides produced in the United States and soldoverseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlledis not a U.S. problem, or crops concerned are generally not grownin America, like coffee, rubber, cocoa, bananas, tea,'' Vroom said.   He said attempts to control how other countries use agriculturalchemicals would amount to U.S. imperialism.   He told Reid's committee, ``Lawn insecticides greatly contributeto the protection of human health by warding off potentiallyharmful bugs, such as ticks, mosquitos, fleas, ants and roaches.''</TEXT></DOC>
