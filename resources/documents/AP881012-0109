Daily Reporter on the release of a hostagein Lebanon:   The release of one hostage in Lebanon has made inevitable aspate of more or less informed surmise about when others may befreed.   Inevitable, too, has been speculation as to a) whether theaction resulted from a secret administration deal with Iran to leta hostage go before the election, and b) whether we can expect an``October surprise'' meant to influence the election's outcome.   As to when other hostages may be released, the short answer isthat no one can confidently say.   The Iranians may be trying to sway American voters, but this isnot certain.   Overt activity by the administration that might be interpretedas ``dealing with terrorists'' can probably be ruled out.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 7   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on withdrawal of the minimum wagebill:   A Republican-led filibuster against legislation to raise theminimum wage recently forced withdrawal of the bill fromconsideration.   The same day the Republican filibuster prevailed, the SenateBudget Committee's Democratic staff released a damning report onjobs and wages. The report showed that half of the new jobs createdover the past nine years don't pay enough to keep a family of fourabove the poverty level.   Republicans ... did introduce a cynical substitute to theDemocratic bill: creation of a subminimum wage to be paid certainworkers, mostly teen-agers, during their first three months on thejob.   Its purpose was not clear, unless it was to suggest thatteen-agers don't need _ or don't deserve _ the minimum wage. Itthat sounds reasonable, look around at various fast food outletsthat employ mostly teen-agers. They are having to pay more thanminimum wage just to attract and retain those employees.   Through their filibuster, the Republicans reiterated support fortheir familiar ``trickle down'' theory. In this case, the onlything trickling down was contempt for the least fortunate inAmerica's work force.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 7   The Honolulu Advertiser on the Chile plebiscite:   Chile has rejected its strong-arm dictator of 15 years through aplebiscite that was noteworthy for its high voter turnout andnear-total absence of complaints of fraud or trouble at the polls.   Credit goes to Chile's people, who seemed determined not to letanything get in the way of their first vote on the presidency in 18years.   But some credit is also due General Augusto Pinochet, who so farhas stood by his pledge to honor the election outcome.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 10   The Milwaukee Journal on traffic problems at Chicago airports:   Reacting to a growing number of mistakes by air trafficcontrollers, the Federal Aviation Administration last week cutpeak-hour landings at Chicago's two major airports, O'Hare andMidway. ...   O'Hare has a dismal record of controller efficiency. The airporthas been the subject of three investigations by the NationalTransportation Safety Board in the last two years.   The board's most recent report, two months ago, said among otherthings that controllers at O'Hare are undertrained and overworked.That suggests part of the remedy: hiring and training morecontrollers.   But that will take time and money. Fortunately, there is aquicker, cheaper remedy to Chicago's airline congestion: greateruse of Milwaukee's Mitchell Airport.   This up-to-date airport can be reached almost as quickly fromsome of Chicago's northern suburbs as Midway, or even O'Hare. Andpassengers are less apt to be stuck in a holding pattern at or overMitchell because it is underused.</TEXT></DOC>
