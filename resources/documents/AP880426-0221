Joseph A. Morris, director of the Justice Department's office ofliaison, said the proposed legislation would be sent to Congressthis week.   The compromise represents a change in position for AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III, who earlier endorsed the NRA approach.Meese now believes that the compromise language is moreenforceable, Morris said.   The approach to dealing with plastic guns _ which are not yetbeing manufactured _ has generated the latest raging debate betweenthe NRA and handgun control groups.   Gun control groups _ joined by police organizations _ have beenlobbying for a bill that would require a minimum standard of metalin any gun, so that the weapon would trigger an alarm in today'smetal detectors.   The NRA has supported a bill by Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho,which would ban undetectable plastic weapons but would set nominimum standard of metal. McClure's approach, however, says thatweapons must be detectable by existing magnetometers.   After several rounds of high-powered lobbying, full-pageadvertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsday rhetoric by allsides, the administration has adopted the minimum metallic standardas the best approach.   NRA officials were not immediately available for comment onwhether they would accept the new approach.   But last year, the NRA said a bill sponsored by Sen. Howard M.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio _ which included a minimum metallic standard _would make a number of small, existing handguns unlawful and amountto ``the first federal gun ban bill in America.''   Morris said no currently made guns would be barred under thecompromise standard, and said he hoped ``everyone can claimvictory.''   Morris said neither the NRA nor the gun control groups were partof the negotiations.   McClure, commenting on the compromise, said he believes theproposal brings all sides closer together, although he stoppedshort of an endorsement.   But he added that if the new language would not ban any existingguns, there would be little substantive difference between the twomeasures.   ``What we were trying to make certain of is that this is adetection bill and not a confiscation bill,'' McClure said.   The senator said the NRA was aware of the new language, and``reacted cautiously. They want to make certain we don't get intothe realm of confiscation of weapons owned by law-abidingcitizens,'' he said.   The compromise was hammered out quietly by the Justice, Treasuryand Transportation departments and the Law Enforcement SteeringCommittee, representing 11 of the nation's major law enforcementgroups.   Meese said earlier this year that he backed the McClure bill.But Morris declined to say that Meese had backtracked, commentinginstead that the attorney general ``will say, `Here's another routethat we think is optimal. We're not turning back on the McClurebill. We think this is a better bill. It's more enforceable.'''   Meese ``ordered a large in-house study on how detection works,''Morris said, and administration experts accepted a metallicstandard of 3.7 ounces of stainless steel.   That figure means any gun passing through a magnetometer must beas detectable as one with 3.7 ounces of stainless steel. Such astandard allows a weapon to have less metal or a different type ofmetal, as long as the standard is met.   The legislation does not specifically mention plastic guns, butwould ban any weapon that does not meet the standard.   So far, Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla., says it has a patentfor plastic weapons but won't start making such handguns for atleast two years, and then will only make them for military andpolice use.   Martha Plotkin, the chairperson of the Law Enforcement SteeringCommittee, said the compromise was not aimed at opposing the NRA,but at writing legislation that is ``workable and would protect thepublic.''   She said the NRA should be ``given an opportunity to look atthis without it being put to them as something they're not going tolike.''   Metzenbaum, whose current bill has a slightly higher metallicstandard than the compromise, said he was ``pleased to hear theJustice Department has listened to the very legitimate concerns ofthe law enforcement community concerning undetectable weapons.   ``From what we understand of the Justice proposal, it is fullycompatible with our legislation and I expect we will be able toincorporate it,'' he said.   His bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who wasinfluential in bringing the law enforcement groups and theadministration together.   In the House, the Judiciary subcommittee on crime hasunanimously approved a plastic gun bill sponsored by its chairman,Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J.   That measure, which went to the full Judiciary Committee, wouldrequire that plastic guns have at least 3.7 ounces of metal _ buthas no provision that would allow lesser amounts of metal thatwould also trigger the alarm.   Hughes, asked about the compromise, said he prefers to use hisown bill as the vehicle for plastic gun legislation because it hasalready begun moving through the House with bipartisan support.   He added, however, ``I don't think there's any significantdifference,'' between the two proposals.</TEXT></DOC>
