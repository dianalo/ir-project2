The Reagan administration successfully tested a so-called ASAT weapon in 1985, and has pushed for further tests since Congress imposed the moratorium in 1986. Defense Department officials argue that the U.S. needs an ASAT weapon to keep pace with the Soviets, who have had an anti-satellite system for several years. Opponents, however, argue that the Soviet system is primitive and believe the U.S. should seek a treaty curbing ASAT weapons.    The testing ban is part of a defense authorization bill being deliberated on the House floor.    Pentagon officials will step up their campaign for the ASAT program once the Senate takes up the matter, and they will push for the project when the two chambers reconcile their defense bills. One argument is that the Soviets will use satellites to target U.S. Navy ships for attack, and that the U.S. needs ASAT weapons to protect its fleet, military officials say. </TEXT></DOC>
