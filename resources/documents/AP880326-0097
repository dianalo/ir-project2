Tony Coelho, D-Calif.:   This is Congressman Tony Coelho.   There is no harder decision in a nation's life than to abandon afailed course even at a time new policies could promise success.History is never generous in offering such moments, and it seldomselects leaders with the wisdom to seize them.   But one such moment arrived late Wednesday in a Central Americanborder town. Two hardened enemies _ the Sandinistas and the Contras_ decided to stop killing each other and signed a plan bringingpolitical freedom to Nicaragua. America should honor this pact andtheir courage for signing it.   The Contras showed great character simply by sitting down withthe Nicaraguan government. Days before, Sandinista troops crossedthe Honduran border and jeopardized the Contra's war supplies.Honoring engrained habits, the Contra leadership could easily haveappealed to American anger and urged renewed military aid. Thisthey did not do.   The Sandinistas also resisted the practices of the past. WhenPresident Reagan deployed 3,200 American soldiers in support of theHondurans, many predicted Nicaragua would break off the peace talksand ask Moscow for a fresh infusion of weapons. Such a requestwould have likely rendered Nicaragua's cycle of war unbreakable;its search for peace unachievable.   But after six years of battle, and 40,000 Nicaraguans dead, theSandinistas and the Contras concluded that war had become acowardly and costly escape from the problems of peace.   Instead, they negotiated an historic accord that offered a roadto democracy for Nicaragua and new avenues of aid for America. Theagreement provides a 60-day cease-fire, an amnesty for politicalprisoners, and freedom for estranged Nicaraguans to return home. Itguarantees press freedom and rights for the Sandinista's opponentsto run for political office. In almost every respect, this accordsatisfies the concerns which prompted us to fund the Nicaragua warin the first place.   The agreement bears the witness of Nicaragua's Cardinal Obandoand the Organization of American States. And it assigns the UnitedStates a role to ensure fulfillment. Under its terms, we canprovide strictly humanitarian aid to the Contras, providing the aidis delivered to the resistance forces by neutral parties.   If it works, the agreement will take on the aspect of modernart, with Republicans and Democrats each finding in it qualitiesthat conform to their own political agendas.   Any politician who wants to claim credit will surely do so, butlet's remember one central point: Nicaraguans from both sides ofthe civil war have closed ranks behind a blueprint for peace. Andthe United States will underscore their efforts or undermine theagreement depending upon how we respond.   Old policies _ like old habits _ die hard. We must resist thetemptation to say ``we know better'' by approving military aidbefore the peace plan has a chance to succeed. The burden onPresident Reagan is to recognize that diplomacy works, join ourcall to end partisanship, and make peace his highest priority.   Speaker Wright wants to put the new agreement to the test. He'sready to schedule a vote on a humanitarian aid bill next week. Ifour Republican colleagues help us write and pass a plan, we canspeed humanitarian aid to the Contras. And the chance for a trulybipartisan policy toward Central America would be at hand.   At another time, at another struggle, Robert F. Kennedy said ofLatin America: ``A revolution is coming _ a revolution which willbe peaceful if we are wise enough; compassionate if we care enough;successful if we are fortunate enough. While we cannot alter itsinevitability,'' he wrote, ``we can affect its character.''   This is the moment all Nicaraguans have been waiting to seize.But in a very real sense, it is our moment too. They have pledgedto bury past hatreds and forge new beginnings. We can do the same.   This week, Americans welcomed the arrival of spring and preparedto observe the Easter and Passover holidays. It is a time tocelebrate rebirth and redemption of people and the resurrection ofa savior. It is a time for renewal.   This year, in the prayers of all Americans, let us remember thestruggle and the sacrifice of the Nicaraguan people, who have knowntoo much war, too much repression, and too little freedom. Let ushope, this time that they find the peace that has eluded them forgenerations.   Thank you, and God bless you.</TEXT><HEAD>End of Text</HEAD></DOC>
