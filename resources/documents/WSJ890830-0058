All applicants now must list Social Security numbers and other facts so the IRS can check its records. It got 73,000 applications filed at embassies and consulates in 1988. Assuming all came from overseas residents, it studied a sample of 615 and estimated that 59% of those required to file 1987 returns didn't -- about equaling the 61% non-filer rate estimated by the General Accounting Office in 1986. The IRS focused on the 42% of the group whose ages were 22 to 65 (54% were younger and 4% older).    The IRS had correct addresses for only 30% of those who didn't file 1987 returns but had filed previously. Only 61% of the applicants gave Social Security numbers; 18% said they weren't required to have numbers, 16% left the space blank, and 5% gave wrong numbers. Return filers showed lower average taxable income and tax rates than U.S. residents; yet only 18.5% seemed to take legal foreign-income exemptions, and only 6% claimed credits for foreign taxes.    Still, once you have a passport, it is good for 10 years.    SAUDI REFUNDS of social-security tax are fully taxable here, the IRS rules.    The news hits tens of thousands of U.S. construction and other workers who have labored in Saudi Arabia. That nation removed foreign workers from its compulsory retirement system and is sending them lump sums in lieu of benefits earned or as refunds of social-security taxes paid by or for them. For long-term workers, the cash may be substantial. As reported here, the IRS has been mulling over the tax consequences.    Now Revenue Ruling 89-104 says payments into the system were taxes, not pension investments, so the full payout must be included in taxable income when received. There seems to be no way to spread out the tax or roll over the cash into another pension plan, Patricia Farro of Ernst andamp; Young, CPAs, says. The ruling treats all workers alike, no matter how they treated the Saudi tax on past returns, she says, but the result is simple and doesn't call for amending any returns.    AN OVERDEVELOPED HOME costs this photographer a business deduction.    Kenneth C. Burkhart Jr. bought and remodeled a three-level Chicago building with an apartment on each floor. He turned the two upper stories into his home and converted the basement apartment into a studio by removing kitchen, bath, and sleeping rooms and closing its outside entrance. He had only $675 of photo-business income in 1984 but deducted larger expenses and showed a loss. Alas, he had exposed himself to the limits on home-office deductions.    The IRS questioned neither the expenses nor Burkhart's use of the basement as his principal place of business. But it noted that apart from mortgage interest and property taxes, which are deductible anyway, the law didn't permit home-office deductions exceeding income; it limited his deductions for depreciation and utilities to $675. Burkhart appealed to the Tax Court. Now Judge Featherston has upheld the IRS.    Burkhart integrated the basement into his home, the judge found. Had the basement stayed a separate unit, Burkhart would have had a better case.    WE CAN LICK 'EM if we stick 'em with a stamp tax, more states say of drug pushers. At least 17 -- including Texas, Idaho, Rhode Island, North Carolina and North Dakota in 1989 -- have enacted stamp or other taxes on drug dealers and stiff penalties on those who don't pay. Texas puts a Grim Reaper image on stamps. Such a tax is more club than revenue raiser. Pacesetter Minnesota has collected $802,000 of $29 million in stamp taxes imposed since 1986.    IRS PROBLEM SOLVERS have handled over 9,000 hardship pleas from taxpayers under new rules and have found 6,700 worthy of special aid, such as accelerating refunds or blocking levies or other enforcement actions, IRS Ombudsman Holmes says.    CHARITIES MAY DIAL 202-343-8900 if they are unsure how to value premiums, such as T-shirts, given to donors, who must reduce deductions by the value of anything received in return for gifts. The IRS will give informal advice on valuation.    LET'S AUTOMATE collections of diverted payroll taxes, the GAO urges.    Employers that don't turn in taxes withheld from employees -- but use the cash, say, to pay other debts -- are major IRS targets. Ultimately, the IRS tries to recoup its losses, plus interest, by seizing personal assets of responsible officials who willfully fail to remit taxes. At June 30, 1987, payroll-tax delinquencies were $15.2 billion; the IRS had assessed $5.6 billion against individuals. But the GAO says the IRS doesn't use its most efficient resource on the debts.    The cases go directly to field agents, bypassing the computerized systems that keep close tabs on other accounts and prompt regular collection attempts by phone. The systems control collection better and close cases at 25% of the cost of field action, the GAO says. It recommends a quick switch to the systems and other procedural changes for payroll-tax cases.    The IRS, which has tested such action in two districts, agrees with most of the recommendations.    BRIEFS: Julia D. Gilreath of Corona, Calif., wasn't an employee of her husband's cocaine business, the Tax Court says. She was a partner and owes self-employment taxes. . . . IRS Notice 89-95 tells employers how to notify workers on the back of Form W-2 wage statements that they may qualify for the earned-income tax credit. </TEXT></DOC>
