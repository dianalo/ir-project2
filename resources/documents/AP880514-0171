(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In Oregon, which relies more than almostany state on local property taxes to pay for schools, there's morethan money at stake in the acrimonious fight over one county's taxvote Tuesday.   Residents of southern Oregon's Josephine County are debating thefuture of public education itself.   One group, People United for Responsible Education, hassuggested leasing public schools to a private corporation, sayingthe schools are too costly and inefficient.   Supporters of the proposed multimillion-dollar property-taxmeasures for the Grants Pass and Josephine County school districtssay the local economy is suffering because of uncertainty aboutschool funding. They believe children will suffer if the taxmeasures are rejected.   ``Public education is not the only means of achievingeducation,'' argues Signe Carlson, president of the JosephineCounty Taxpayers Association. ``We have a lot of private schools inthe county, a lot of parents who are involved in home schooling.''   A political consultant enlisted to help pass the measures, C.Montgomery Johnson, says the tax fight is the most divisive he'sseen in Oregon.   ``I don't think the system of public education in JosephineCounty is going to survive without constant support on the part offolks, many of whom have given up,'' he says.   Oregon's school-financing woes long have been blamed on thestate's dependence on the local property tax. The NationalEducation Association ranks Oregon third nationally in its relianceon local revenue: 66.6 percent of its school financing comes fromproperty taxes. Oregon has no sales tax.   ``The great, progressive state of Oregon ought to stick its headunder the pillow,'' Johnson says. ``It ought to be ashamed of theway it funds public schools.''   Josephine County voters are known for their strong anti-taxsentiment, born of the 1970s tax revolt and maintained by thewell-organized and vocal taxpayers' association. Many residentsmoved to the county to escape high land values and taxes in otherstates.   But many, too, consider public education the foundation ofdemocracy.   ``We've had some professional people refuse to move here becauseof the situation,'' says Susan Allen, a leader of a pro-schoolsgroup formed several months ago in response to the anti-tax forces.``We've had people putting their houses on the market because ifthe tax bases do fail, they won't be able to sell them.''   Carlson dismisses Johnson's claim that her association is out todestroy public education. A teacher who left the profession in1960, she insists the schools could be run more efficiently.   ``We have the lowest per-capita income of any county in thestate, and yet the public employees, the teachers andadministrators, want the same salaries and benefits of everywhereelse,'' Carlson says.   State figures, however, show the Josephine County district willspend $3,335 per student this year while Grants Pass will spend$3,627, well below the state average of $4,007.   ``They're not on the bottom, but they're close to the bottom,''says Walter Koscher, a statistician for the Oregon EducationDepartment in Salem.   Oregon used to force schools to close when voters repeatedlyrejected tax measures. Last year Oregon voters approved theso-called ``safety net'' law, which allows districts to levy theprevious year's property tax if voters won't approve more money.   The safety net has its holes, however. If other revenue sourcesdecline and expenses rise, the previous tax levy quickly becomesinadequate.   Josephine County's school districts and their 9,800 studentsface major staff and program cuts next fall if they fall into thesafety net again.   The districts in recent years already cut staff, closed schools,increased class sizes, and postponed equipment purchases. Someschool buses in Grants Pass have been on the road since 1959,superintendent Dale Smith says.   Smith says his school board will begin work on a $1.5 millionbudget cut Wednesday if voters reject the city district's proposed$12.2 million tax base.   John Mayfield, county schools superintendent, says his districtfaces a $2.5 million cut if its $14.3 million tax base is turneddown. That could mean 25 teacher layoffs and elimination ofextra-curricular activities and field trips, among other cuts, hesays.   ``I'm embarrassed that the state would allow a district to dothe things we're looking at doing, the cuts in staff andprograms,'' Mayfield says. ``I'm embarrassed to live in a statethat would let that happen.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, May 17</NOTE></DOC>
