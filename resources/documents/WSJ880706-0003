McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PCS CMD MIN PET </IN><TEXT>   A government weather report issued on the Fourth of July kept the fireworks from going off in the farm futures pits yesterday.    Soybean futures prices settled sharply lower following a National Weather Service forecast for above-normal moisture in some parts of the Midwest. The soybean contract for November delivery fell 26.5 cents a bushel to $9.585, while the soybean contract for July fell 29.5 cents to $9.59 a bushel. Some corn futures prices closed moderately higher, though, as little of the rain was expected to fall in major corngrowing areas, analysts said. What's more, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, &quot;Many people feel there's already been irreversible damage done to the corn crop.&quot;    Corn futures prices, in fact, rallied sharply at the open but drifted downward when soybean futures prices dropped off. &quot;It's hard to move corn independent of beans,&quot; said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;If the beans had been unchanged the corn may have been up the limit.&quot;    Some analysts were surprised by the strong bearish sentiment the market attached to the weather-service report, particularly because private weather forecasters were largely discounting the outlook for more rain. The official six-to-10-day forecast by the National Weather Service called for above-normal moisture in Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, among other states.    &quot;We were very surprised when we saw what was a pretty wet forecast,&quot; said Charles Notis, a weather forecaster with Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa. &quot;From everything we see for the period, we're expecting much of the same -- above normal temperatures and below normal rainfall.&quot; Added Ken Reeves, a meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa., &quot;We think the odds favor below-normal rainfall in this period.&quot;    Corn and soybean futures prices zig-zagged during the day, as traders tried to reconcile the conflicting forecasts -- rain one minute, no rain the next. &quot;There were a lot of ups and downs,&quot; says Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;In a matter of minutes, soybeans moved 10 to 15 cents.&quot;    Traders seemed to discount near-term forecasts that call for searing weather in parts of the Midwest. Mr. Mao said the 36-hour forecasts of some meteorologists call for 100-degree temperatures in key areas of the Corn Belt. &quot;The crop isn't getting any better,&quot; he said, noting yesterday's falling soybean prices, &quot;but the market psychology is getting worse.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ENERGY: Crude oil prices edged upward, picking up strength from a strong gasoline market. Supplies of gasoline for immediate delivery are tight as summer vacationers crowd the highways. There was little response to weekend tensions in the Persian Gulf springing from the Iran-Iraq war. A U.S. naval vessel, fighting off Iranian gunboats in that body of water, accidently shot down an Iranian airliner Sunday killing 290 people. In addition, a U.S. frigate came to the aid of a supertanker under attack by three Iranian gunboats off the coast of Dubai late Saturday. It was the first time the U.S. Navy came to the assistance of a vessel in the Persian Gulf not flying the U.S. flag. But there was &quot;no knee-jerk reaction or panic&quot; to Middle East tensions because crude oil producers continue to pump more crude than consumers can use and any cutback in Middle Eastern oil supplies could be replaced by well-stocked inventories, said Andrew Lebow, analyst for E.D.andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc.    COPPER: Futures prices rebounded from Friday's declines in volatile trading. September delivery copper settled 1.70 cents a pound higher at 95.10 cents, but it traded as high as 97 cents and as low as 94.30 cents. Friday's drop mostly reflected declines in aluminum, an analyst said. Yesterday, the market apparently ignored a rise of 1,450 tons in London Metal Exchange warehouse copper stocks to 89,850 tons because the increase had been expected, the analyst said. Instead, traders apparently took their cue from the continued strong U.S. economic climate. One indicator, according to the analyst, was the monthly report by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which said that both production and new orders during June grew at the best pace since last December.    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices were mixed. August delivery gold was up 70 cents an ounce to $440.30. September silver gained six cents an ounce to $6.8550. October platinum eased $4.60 an ounce to $563.60. Gold isn't reacting to the potentially inflationary impact of higher grain and soybean prices, one analyst said, but is influenced more by currencies, especially the dollar, which has been stronger recently but eased yesterday. Platinum declined on news that miners and management in South Africa had settled their wage dispute, he said. Cash markets for precious metals were quiet in both Europe and the Far East, the analyst added. </TEXT></DOC>
