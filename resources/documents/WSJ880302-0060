The 12-8 vote reflected senators' concerns about hostile takeovers, which Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.) said could harm companies and their employees. The panel approved the measure despite a statement from Michael Bradfield, the Fed's general counsel, that the Fed has all the statutory authority it needs to deal with hostile or friendly takeovers.    The amendment wouldn't affect the proposed $1.08 billion takeover of Irving Bank Corp. by Bank of New York Co., which the Fed already has conditionally cleared. But a Bank of New York spokesman voiced fears that it could be changed later to restrict or block the merger. In clearing the Bank of New York merger, the Fed said it applies the same statutory criteria to hostile and friendly takeovers. </TEXT></DOC>
