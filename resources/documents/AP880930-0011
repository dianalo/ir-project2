SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America is an increasingly metropolitannation, with more than three out of four people living in urbanareas, the Census Bureau reports.   The nation's 282 metropolitan areas grew to 187.1 millionresidents as of July 1, 1987, up 1 percent from the year before andcompared to just 0.3 percent growth in rural areas, the bureaureported Thursday.   Florida and Texas included nine of the nation's fastest-growingmetropolitan areas, and all 10 leaders were in the Sun Belt, thestudy found.   Only one change occurred among the 10 largest metro areas, withWashington, D.C., edging up one spot to edge out Houston for theNo. 9 ranking.   The Washington area added 78,300 people between 1986 and 1987while economically plagued Houston lost 21,000, the bureau said.The 1987 figures show Washingto with 3,646,000 people to Houston's3,626,300.   Naples, Fla., was listed as the fastest-growing metro area,climbing 49 percent in this decade to 127,900, placing it at 215thamong metro areas. That's up from 265th place in 1980.   Most of the fastest-growing areas had relatively smallerpopulation bases, however. That means it doesn't take as many newarrivals to provide a large percentage increase.   The fastest-growing metropolitan area of 1 million or more wasPhoenix, census officials noted. It grew by 30 percent in thisdecade, edging out Dallas-Fort Worth, which was up 27 percent.   While 76.9 percent of Americans live in the nation's 282metropolitan areas, nearly half, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37areas with more than a million residents each, the report showed.   Metropolitan areas are designated by the federal Office ofManagement and Budget and are used for many federal programs. Ingeneral, they consist of a central city with at least 50,000residents and the surrounding region which is economically linkedto that city. Many metropolitan areas include several major cities,often crossing state lines.   Washington, for example, includes portions of Virginia andMaryland; the New York metro areas extends into New Jersey andConnecticut and Chicago also counts sections of Indiana andWisconsin.   New York remains firmly atop the list of metro areas, includingan estimated 18,053,800 people, up from 18,019,800 in 1986 and17,539,532 in the 1980 census.   Second is the Los Angeles region with 13,470,900, followed byChicago, 8,146,900; San Francisco, 5,953,100 and Philadelphia,5,890,600.   Rounding out the top 10 were Detroit, Boston, Dallas, Washingtonand Houston.   While the census study didn't include growth rates for all metroareas, here is the list of the 10 fastest-growing metro areasbetween 1980 and 1987:   1. Naples, Fla., 127,900, up 49 percent.   2. Ocala, Fla., 181,300, up 48 percent.   3. Fort Myers, Fla., 294,600, up 44 percent.   4. Fort Pierce, Fla., 215,400, up 43 percent.   5. Austin, Texas, 738,000, up 38 percent.   6. Melbourne, Fla., 374,900, up 37 percent.   7. West Palm Beach, Fla., 790,100, up 37 percent.   8. Las Cruces, N.M., 128,800, up 34 percent.   9.
