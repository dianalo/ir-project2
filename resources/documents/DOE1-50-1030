Theinternal wave is magnetized plasma in which the magnetic field changessharply over a small region obeys the modified Benjamin-Ono equation.This equation with periodic boundary conditions can be solved by a pole-expansiontechnique, which changes the dissipative Benjamin-Ono equation to a systemof ordinary equations of poles. The pole expansion is an exact nonlinearmode-truncation method in which a finite number of poles are used torepresente the asymptotic behavior of the system. Numerical results andanalytical proof show that the pole representation is complete. The equationof poles allows linear and nonlinear stability analyses. Because thenumber of poles in the asymptotic state is proportional to the ratioof the growth to the damping, fully developed turbulence can be reachedif the system has a very large number of poles. Additional research wasperformed to study the statistical properties of turbulent flows, includingcorrelation functions and energy spectra.</TEXT></DOC>
