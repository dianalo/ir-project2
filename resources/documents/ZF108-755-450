Well, if you're counting on &quot;dumb&quot;equipment and mere coin traffic, you'd have a pretty hard time of it.andP;  But ifyou're talking today's &quot;smart&quot; payphones, you could be lookin' at a prettygood thing.andM;The key is making money on calling-card and collect calls.andP;  A full 80% of allpayphone revenues come from these types of non-coin calls.andP;  Obviously, ifyou're not getting a piece of that fat pie, you're missing the boat.andM;The good news is most payphones today allow you to get at that money.andP;  We'retalking smart payphones with store-and-forward intelligence and voiceprocessing technology built into the individual machines.andM;Store-and-forward technology lets the phone validate calling and credit cardnumbers, process collect calls and complete long distance calls - without theneed for a live operator (the dreaded OSP Operator Services Provider).andP;  Andbesides being able to store information (like a person's calling-card number)and forward it (to, for instance, a PC-based management system for billing ora validation service), there's usually some automated voice functions builtin as well.andM;This lets people get at collect calls (and helps automate calling-card callstoo).andP;  When you think about it, there's very little need for a live operator(and his/her expense) when it comes to a collect call.andP;  A person dials a O+number, you need somebody to come on and say, whom should we say is calling?andO;Play that message to the called party and then say something like, press 1 ifyou'd like to accept the call, please.andP;  Pretty simple application.andM;But to do it, your payphone has to have built-in electronics that will allowthe phone to digitize voice (so the called party can actually hear the callis from Uncle Ralph from Toledo), accept touchtone and be able to, once more,store and forward the called number for billing.andM;Both Intellicall's IntelliStar and Elcotel's PAOF (Payphone AutomatedOperator Function) are good examples of systems that let a payphone dealerhandle both of these applications and, thus, get at the considerable revenuethey generate.andP;  Surcharges on calling-card and collect calls are regulated bydifferent states, but the going rate for the former ranges from 50 cents to$1.25 and around 80 cents for handling a collect call.andP;  You can see how thatadds up (see 80% statistic above).andM;Other important new technology that helps payphone people make money:Electronic Coin ValidatorsandM;One of the biggest problems with old payphones is their susceptibility tostuffing (for a description of stuffing see standalone on page 150) andslugs.andP;  High-tech coin validators and simplified coin paths reduce invalidcoin entries.andP;  Look for it.andP;  Hey, it's your nickel, make sure it's real.andM;Intense ManagementandM;SystemsandM;Besides managing the all-important store-and-forward functions discussedabove (again, like IntelliStar and PAOF), these systems let payphone dealerspinpoint and analyze any phone or group of phones in their network.andP;  Theyalso pump out a variety of performance reports that the dealer can customizeas he/she sees fit.andM;The idea of remote diagnostics is not that new.andP;  For some time now, phonescould report back to a management system to say they were screwed up.andP;  Butdealers need more than that.andP;  They need instant performance reports.andP;  Todaythey can get it.andM;Let's say you have a phone in a supermarket.andP;  But the stockboys have suddenlydecided that the perfect place to stack a new shipment of bathroom tissue(formerly called toilet paper) is in front of the payphone.andP;  Nobody can getat the phone.andP;  The phone's not broken, but it's under-performing.andP;  As apayphone dealer, you want to know about it.andM;Basically, this kind of software-based system available today gives thedealer access to an instant snapshot of his/her business, letting him knowhow the phones are doing.andP;  Very important.andP;  If the phone in the abovescenario wasn't checked for a week, that would be a week of lost revenues.andO;That's bad, no matter what your business.andM;Voice MessagingandM;Industry figures show that about 50% of the calls from payphones are notcompleted because of either a busy signal or no answer.andP;  If a caller getseither of these, of course, he walks away and no money is made.andP;  Notsurprisingly then, voice messaging is very much in demand.andM;Voice messaging allows a caller to leave a message that will attempt to bedelivered for up a certain amount of time, spread out over shortishintervals, until it is received or times out.andP;  The service effectivelyconverts a non-revenue event into one that generates a profit and increasescustomer satisfaction.andM;The majority of voice messaging services are available through the privatepayphone industry (Intellicall expects to come out with such a system soon,it's in testing now and they're very excited about it), but some RBOCs areplanning trials for the service in their operating regions.andM;The application will look like this: you call a number from a payphone;there's no answer or busy; an automated operator voice will say, please stayon the line, if you would like to leave a message for the called party, wewill attempt to delivery it every 15 minutes for the next four hours for afee of $??? (up to the dealer), press 1 if you're interested, leave a messageat the tone and we will attempt delivery, etc.andM;This one is neat.andP;  And juicy too.andP;  Again, it creates revenues from apreviously non-revenue source.andP;  Always a good thing.andM;Speed DialingandM;Additional commissions can be made by renting out speed-dial buttons tobusiness subscribers, such as hotel proprietors and car rental agencies.andO;These buttons, typically 10 to 12 per phone, are separate from the regulardialing keypad and are labeled with the respective subscriber's name andlogo.andP;  And most smart phones can be programmed to do anything you want themtoo, regardless of whether they have separate buttons on them.andP;  They'resmart, so you can set them up any way that's going to maximize your profits.andM;Backroom ElectronicsandM;In a lot of places, it's not feasible to put a full-fledged payphoneeverywhere in a space - like a phone at every booth in a truckstop.andP;  Today,you can handle such an appetizing application by slamming ordinary trimlinephones (or the phone of your choice) where you want to and having the smartelectronics in a backroom.andP;  IntelliCall can do this and we mentioned thetruckstop environment because it's really been successful in thatenvironment.andP;  This would be fantastic at tradeshows, we'd bet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
