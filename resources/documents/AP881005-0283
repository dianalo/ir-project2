In a three-page letter last week to about 3,000 workers in thePhiladelphia area, SmithKline said those who sign a waiver willreceive more severance pay, career counseling and extended healthbenefits.   Henry Wendt, chairman and chief executive officer, said in theletter a ``similar package for voluntary resignation in designatedareas will be announced later this year.''   Workers who don't sign the waiver will be eligible for thestandard severance package, and some longtime workers will beeligible for an enhanced pension whether they sign a waiver or not.   SmithKline announced last week it would eliminate 1,600 jobs,mostly in Philadelphia, as part of a $400 million restructuringthat will include the public sale of 17 percent of its BeckmanInstruments division.   Bernard Shaeffer, vice president for research for Hay-HugginsCo. Inc., a Philadelphia benefits-consulting firm, said companiescommonly ask employees to sign a waiver in return for enhancedseparation benefits.   The company said employees who earn a weekly paycheck _including most production workers and secretaries _ would receivetwo to three times as much as they would under the standard plan,if they sign the waiver.   For example, a 17-year employee earning a weekly paycheck wouldnormally get 18 weeks of severance pay. Under the enhanced plan,that worker would receive nearly 56 weeks of pay.   Workers paid twice a month _ including managers and supervisors_ would get 25 percent more than the normal severance.   For example, a 10-year veteran's severance pay would last sixmonths and a week instead of the standard five months.   The career counseling will be available to all who sign thewaiver. Normally such transition assistance is only offered toupper-level employees, a company spokesman said.   SmithKline will continue to pay its share of health benefits forsix months after termination instead of three months.   A company spokesman said employees would be encouraged to reviewthe severance package for at least 10 days before deciding whetherto sign the waiver.</TEXT></DOC>
