On a 259-169 vote, lawmakers adopted language that would makepermanent the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours orless, which otherwise will expire next April. The ban covers 80percent of domestic air traffic.   But the provision, which was not actively opposed by the tobaccoindustry, also forbade consideration of a proposal to extend theban to all domestic flights.   The language became part of the $11.9 billion transportationappropriations bill for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The Houseplanned to complete work on the bill on Thursday and send it to theSenate.   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the smoking banproposal, cited surveys of airline passengers by health groupsshowing an overwhelming number of them support the two-hour banCongress adopted in April 1988.   ``I can't think of a thing we've done on the floor of the Housein the last two years that has been greeted as positively andwarmly by the American people,'' he told his colleagues.   Durbin, who sponsored the 1988 law, wanted to offer an amendmentthat would have banned smoking on all domestic flights. But he wasblocked by the rules of the House from offering it and was unableto persuade the House to change the procedure.   The smoking ban provision was backed by airline employee andhealth organizations, which have argued that so-called secondarysmoke breathed by people sitting next to smokers can be dangerous.   The tobacco and cigarette industries and their supporters inCongress _ mostly from tobacco-growing states _ have argued thatdefinitive data on the dangers of smoking is lacking, and that aprohibition hurts growers and manufacturers.   However, lobbyists laid low during Wednesday's vote. Theyconceded that anti-smoking sentiment in Congress had reached thepoint where they were better off accepting a permanent ban ontwo-hour flights and avoiding fights on broadening the prohibitionevery time the law expires.   ``We're not going to support this, but that doesn't mean we'reactively opposing it, either,'' Walker Merryman, vice president ofthe Tobacco Institute, said before the vote.   ``This is no worse than what we've been living with,'' said Rep.Walter Jones, D-N.C., whose district is one of the biggest tobaccoproducers in the country. ``We hope this is the last we'll hear ofthis for the time being.''   Technically, the House vote was on the procedure lawmakers willfollow when they debate the transportation spending bill onThursday, and other issues were involved. But floor debate over theprovision was dominated by the smoking ban question.</TEXT></DOC>
