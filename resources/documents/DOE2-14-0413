Accordingto the EPA, lead concentrations rise due to corrosive, aggressive waterrunning over lead solder or lead pipes. The EPA expects to release regulationsthis spring dictating corrosivity limits for every utility. Corrosioncontrol, because it is not a residential variable, is the agency's onlyenforceable regulation option. Lead solder is probably the greatest singlecontributor to lead contamination of drinking water in this country.When used to connect copper pipes, the most popular residential piping,ensuring galvanic reactions raise the solubility of lead. The articledescribes what Portland, Oregon is doing to reduce the levels of leadin drinking water. Nationally the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Amendmentshave given each state until June 1988 to ban leaded-solder or face 5%cuts in federal water funds. As national policy begins to dictate reductionsin lead sources and water corrosivity, specific lead problems demandingindividual solutions will remain. For example, electric drinking waterfountains have sizable elevations of lead in them. It is difficult toflush them as one would a household tap before using the water.</TEXT></DOC>
