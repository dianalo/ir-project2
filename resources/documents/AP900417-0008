Between 400 and 500 of them parked their cabs in the street andturned on their lights Monday afternoon after someone broadcast afalse report over their radios that another driver had been shot,said police Officer Fred Weiner.   Scores of drivers have quit, stayed home or refused to drive atnight because of the slayings, three of which have been describedby police as the work of a serial killer.   ``This guy, he's freaking us out. I went to church to pray forall my companions that nothing would happen to them,'' said driverRandy Martinez.   At the Seaman Car Service, employer of the latest victim, blackflags flew Monday from the antennas of cabs, and drivers held amemorial procession.   The latest attack, on Saturday, and another three days earlierwere dismissed by police as unrelated to the first three, but theyheightened fears in an area where cab drivers have not felt safefor decades.   In 1989, about half of the 32 cab driver killings citywideoccurred in the Bronx, police said.   A task force of about 30 police officers has been assigned toinvestigate. Mayor David Dinkins has offered a $10,000 reward forinformation leading to the killers.   The terror spree began March 7. In each of the first threeshootings, a man phoned a car service requesting a cab and thenkilled the driver with a shot to the head from a .22-caliber gunand robbed him.   ``The first three are connected and the last two are not,'' saidOfficer Ralph St. Just, a police spokesman. Police won't explainexactly why.   Some car service companies have lost up to 80 percent of theirdrivers at night because of fear caused by the deaths, said TonyCarter, spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, whichlicenses cabs in the city.   Angel Bello, a dispatcher for Seaman, said dispatchers wereserving only regular customers or patrons who clearly know wherethey are going. One-third of the Monday night workforce showed up,he said.   At the Flash Car Service Co., only 15 of the 80 drivers whonormally work Sunday nights showed, said dispatcher Pablo Feliciano.   ``Most of them are switching to the days,'' he said. ``They'rereally disturbed about what's going on. Everybody's shaken upreally badly.''</TEXT></DOC>
