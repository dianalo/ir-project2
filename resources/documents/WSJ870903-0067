It is a country that has undergone profound change in just two generations. It has overcome the stagnation of a collapsed empire, military defeat, foreign occupation, a dictatorship and a vicious Marxist assault. After all this it has begun to restore basic democratic institutions. On Sunday it will hold a referendum on whether to allow Turkish politicians banned under the 1982 constitution to run again for office.    Almost no one cares about the 100 or so fringe politicians affected by the ban. The main players are the current prime minister, Turgut Ozal, and former prime ministers Bulent Ecevit on the ineffectual left and Suleyman Demirel on the right. It's not uncharacteristic in the Byzantium of Turkish politics that the referendum has digressed from its ostensible purpose into a test of political strength. Mr. Ozal, however, has been warning against sliding toward a resumption of the fratricidal politics of the 1970s.    The chaos caused by the Demirel-Ecevit rivalry from 1974 to 1980 created enormous political instability and made the country particularly vulnerable to a massive Soviet-sponsored destabilization campaign. In September 1980, an average of 28 murders a day took place. The military -- the trustee of democracy as envisioned by Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey -- literally saved the country. It launched corrective measures, including the new constitution and the ban on the discredited politicians, and then withdrew.    An economic crisis hammered Turkey throughout the disturbances of the 1970s. Inflation, farm subsidies and state enterprises forced the strongest business sectors underground and nearly ruined the country. In January 1980, Mr. Demirel gave his young economic counselor, Turgut Ozal, the go-ahead to start reforms, which became a blueprint for an open, free-market economy.    Mr. Ozal himself was swept into office as prime minister when elections were called in the fall of 1983. Today he has a two-thirds majority. Last year Turkey led the 24 OECD countries with a 7.9% growth rate. Exports of products such as TV sets, automobiles, carpets, textiles, construction materials and services, and nuts and figs have quadrupled since 1980. By 1986 manufactured products accounted for two-thirds of Turkey's $8 billion of sales abroad.    This forward movement has occurred despite political realities that have impeded the pace of economic modernization. Entrenched business interests have resisted privatization efforts. Moreover, inflation fueled by election-oriented monetary stimulation has rebounded to 40% in the first seven months of 1987. Foreign debt, at $34 billion, is 55% of GDP. Exports actually receded last year. Compounding these problems is a recent resurgence of activity by Marxist Kurdish guerrillas, who infiltrate Turkey's southeastern provinces from Syria. Last month they massacred 25 villagers in the worst such incident so far.    Despite its economic and political progress, Turkey somehow remains on the receiving end of constant carping from Washington and Europe about perfecting its democratic ideals. These Western complaints are a strangely abstract exercise.    Turkey is a member of NATO, serving as the critically important, eastern-most overland link between Europe and the Persian Gulf. Unlike all but one of its NATO colleagues, Turkey's borders actually abut the Soviet Union. Despite its geography, Turkey remains committed to the security of the West. It looks north toward Europe, to become a full participant in the political, economic and military future of the West. Precious few other countries today make that claim. The people of Turkey and Mr. Ozal deserve support. </TEXT></DOC>
