In well-organized maneuvers in five tumultuous days in February1948, the Communists assumed control in a nation where they hadbuilt up power steadiy since winning close to 40 percent of thevote in national elections in 1946.   Posters showing a triumphant Klement Gottwald, then the leaderof the Communist Party, now adorn public buildings all overCzechoslovakia as authorities mark the anniversary with atraditional Communist display of public pageantry.   In Prague, party leaders will hold a ceremonial meeting onWednesday and preside Thursday over a mass rally in the historicOld Town Square, scene of a triumphant speech by Gottwald four daysbefore he became head of the first all-Communist government on Feb.25, 1948.   In a land keenly aware of its turbulent history, thecelebrations fall in a year popularly known as ``the big eight''for its plethora of significant anniversaries.   In 1918, Czechoslovakia became an independent democracy. In1938, it was occupied by the Nazis. In 1948, the Communists tookover and in 1968, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks crushed aCommunist-led reform, which advocated changes similar to those nowoccurring in the Soviet Union.   Each of these events colors the mixed feelings of Czechoslovaksold enough to recall the hectic days in 1948, a heady time foryoung Communists getting their first taste of power.   ``It was the lost revolution,'' sighed a longtime Communist,speaking on condition of anonymity.   A survivor of the purge of 500,000 party members that followedthe 1968 crackdown, the man recalled the enthusiasm, hard work andhonesty of party workers 40 years ago.   Today, the Communists dominate public life. But new Communistleader Milos Jakes finds himself calling for an end to widespreadcorruption and must exhort workers to produce more under economicreforms that so far are more word than deed.   Czechoslovakia's economy, ranked tenth among industrializednations before World War II, is now badly in need of modernizationand expensive ecological controls to undo some of the environmentaldamage wrought by rapid large-scale industrialization in the last40 years.   Jakes must try to mobilize the country's 15.5 million people toboost growth and achieve declared goals of a vastly improved livingstandard by the year 2000. But the current Communist leadershipseems unwilling to countenance the political and culturalliberalization that could win widespread popular backing for theirprogram of change.   In a Europe then overshadowed by the Cold War, the Communisttakeover in Czechoslovakia set the seal on Soviet domination ofEastern Europe.   Yugoslavia was to pull out of Moscow's orbit just four monthslater, but remained Communist. Soviet-style communism held sway inHungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland and Albania, whichdid not break with Moscow until 1960, but also remained Communist.   Hungary this week marks 40 years since its first cooperation andfriendship treaty with Moscow by hosting Soviet President AndreiGromyko.   A senior Soviet leader may also attend this week's celebrationsin Czechoslovakia, whose complex relations with Moscow are markedby events both before and after the 1948 takeover.   Thousands of Czechoslovaks openly protested the 1968 Warsaw Pactinvasion and remain resentful of Moscow for ordering it. Yet manyare now enthused by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   A Prague man, who did not belong to the party, recalledCzechoslovakia's enthusiasm with the Soviet Union in the 1930s,when Russia's booming economic growth impressed many Czechoslovakswho suffered under the Depression.   In 1938, he said, faith in the West was shaken when Britain andFrance, the models for Czechoslovakia's democrats, allowed AdolfHitler's armies to march into Prague on the pretext of reclaimingthe ethnically German Sudetenland.   Fear of Germany took deep root, leading to popular support forthe Communist opposition to West Germany after World War II.   The Communists, the only political party to keep an organizationgoing in the war, exploited such prewar sentiments after 1945 andbuilt on popular sympathy for the Soviet troops who liberated 90percent of Czechoslovakia from the Nazis.   By 1947, the Soviets wielded enough influence for Czechoslovakiato reject U.S. economic aid under the Marshall Plan _ an act thatin Western eyes put the nation firmly into the Soviet bloc.   Internally, the decisive moment came when non-Communistministers resigned from Czechoslovakia's government on Feb. 20,1948. After five days of street rallies and political struggle, theCommunists emerged as the sole governing force and soon initiated aStalinist-style terror that silenced their opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
