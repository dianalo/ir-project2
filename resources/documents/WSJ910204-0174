Two recent Supreme Court actions illustrate thisdifficulty. Although both involved comparatively recentprecedents that are on the hit list of some in the court'snew conservative majority, neither case resulted in asignificant ruling. In one case the court simply refused tohear an appeal, while in the other the justices dismissed thepetition after hearing oral arguments.</LP><TEXT>   There are a number of factors that may weigh against aconservative juggernaut at the high court. One is thatrespect for precedent is a powerful influence on justices,although far from an inviolate one.   In a 1989 speech, retired Justice Lewis Powell warned ofthe importance of precedent. &quot;Stability and moderation areuniquely important to the law,&quot; he said. &quot;Restraint ondecision making, and respect for decisions once made, are thekeys to preservation of an independent judiciary and publicrespect for its role as the guardian of rights.&quot;   Another factor is that the court has erected numerousprocedural hurdles that must be overcome before the justicescan get to the heart of a case. Those hurdles, designed toensure that an issue is squarely presented and is ready fordecision on a well-developed record, often stand in the wayof resolving questions that at first glance appear to be ofmajor importance.   The result is that change has historically come moreslowly to the Supreme Court than turnover in the membershipof the institution may suggest.   That point was illustrated by two high court actions onJan. 22. In one, the high court dismissed an appeal by thestate of Ohio just one week after the justices heardarguments in the case. The issue that the high court hadagreed to decide was whether the Constitution permits juriesthat are deliberating over whether to impose the deathpenalty on a convicted murderer to consider the impact of thecrime on the victim's family.   In 1987, the court ruled 5-4 that use of victim impactstatements in death penalty cases violates the EighthAmendment prohibition of &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; Thecourt said a jury may only weigh factors having to do withthe defendant's record when deciding whether to impose thedeath penalty.   A majority of the current nine justices -- Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justices Byron White, Sandra O'Connor,Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy -- have said at differenttimes that the decision was wrong and they are prepared tooverrule it.   Ohio's appeal must have looked like the perfect vehicle.The Ohio Supreme Court had thrown out the death sentence ofEdiberto Huertas because his victim's parents were allowed totestify about how the murder had affected their lives. Itwasn't until the oral argument that the justices realizedthat the Ohio court's decision seemed to rest more oninterpretation of state law, than of the U.S. Constitution.   The Supreme Court may not review state court decisionsthat are based on state law and that don't implicate federallaw or the Constitution. When the high court can't tell whatthe basis was for the state court ruling, it tends to throwout the case, no matter how badly some justices want tosettle the issue.   In the other case, the justices refused to consider anappeal by Kern County, Calif., which was ordered by a federalappeals court in San Francisco to comply with the federalFair Labor Standards Act by paying fire battalion chiefsovertime. The appeals court said the battalion chiefs don'tfall into a category of executives who are exempt from thefederal law.   The county urged the high court to revive its 1976decision that the Constitution bars Congress from regulatingthe wage-and-hour conditions of state and local governmentworkers. The high court overruled the 1976 decision in 1985,with the author of the earlier rule, Justice Rehnquist,vowing to win in a future case.   The justices gave no reason for rejecting the countyappeal. They may have felt it wasn't a good case in which tore-examine the issue, since the appeals court simply appliedfederal law and didn't address at all whether it shouldapply.   The issues in both the Ohio and Kern County cases arecertain to return to the Supreme Court, but at least for themoment, the precedents stand.</TEXT></DOC>
