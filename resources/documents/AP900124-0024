William Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency,told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that U.S.reliance on Persian Gulf oil will more than double in the comingfew years.   ``Western dependence on Persian Gulf oil will risedramatically'' in the next few years, Webster said, adding the Gulfshare of U.S. oil supplies would rise from 10 percent in 1989 to``roughly 25 percent'' in a few years. He did not mention a precisetime period and did not elaborate on the import issue.   President Bush contends more reliance on the Persian Gulf willundermine U.S. national security because of the risk of a supplyinterruption. This argument, disputed by many environmentalists andmembers of Congress, is central to the administration's efforts toopen more federal lands and waters to oil exploration.   John Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation in New York, said in an interview thatWebster's forecast was reasonable if he was projecting to 1995. Hesaid ``it's a little bit exaggerated'' if Webster meant the rise to25 percent would occur in two or three years.   Lichtblau said his organization was projecting Persian Gulf oilwill account for between 22 and 23 percent of U.S. supplies by1995. He and other analysts tie the increase to growing U.S. oilconsumption, continuing declines in U.S. oil production anddeclining exports by non-Gulf oil exporters such as Britain.   Total U.S. oil imports last year rose to 7.9 million barrels aday. That was a 10-year high and meant 46 percent of U.S. oilsupplies came from foreign sources, according to the AmericanPetroleum Institute, an industry trade association.   Dillard Spriggs, president of the consulting firm PetroleumAnalysis Ltd. in New York, said ``in five years' time it's quitelikely'' that the United States will be getting one-quarter of itsoil from the Persian Gulf, but not before then.   ``That's where it's got to come from,'' he said, since no majornew oil fields are scheduled to come into production outside theGulf in the next few years.   The Energy Department's forecasting office does not publishprojections of U.S. dependence on oil from specific regions of theworld, said W. Calvin Kilgore, who directs the office. But Kilgoresaid he foresees ``at least a doubling'' of U.S. reliance on thePersian Gulf over the next five years.</TEXT></DOC>
