StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The wider-than-expected August U.S. trade deficit threw the dollar into a decline, but traders ended up being surprised that the currency's losses weren't still more severe.    The dollar tumbled the furthest against the Japanese currency, falling 1.1% to stand at 142.30 yen in late New York trading, compared with 143.89 late Tuesday. The dollar also fell 0.9% to 1.8054 West German marks from 1.8225.    Those quotes represented the U.S. currency's lows for the day and its lowest levels since early September. At that time, the dollar was beginning a gradual recovery from a three-week sell-off caused by bad news on the trade deficit in mid-August.    The monthly trade figures have become the single most important economic statistic affecting exchange rates. Yesterday's report that the U.S. trade gap narrowed just slightly to $15.68 billion in August from a record $16.47 billion in July was worse than many already pessimistic predictions.    &quot;The dollar was marked down immediately,&quot; Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. Within seconds of the trade report early in the New York trading day, the dollar dropped 0.5% to 1.8120 marks from 1.8220, he said.    Shortly afterward, the currency regained its balance and moved lower more gradually in moderate trading, dealers said. The decline was so orderly that rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve and West German Bundesbank were buying dollars in the market to stabilize the currency.    But the rumors gained little currency of their own, particularly at the major New York banks that the Fed frequently uses for currency market intervention.    &quot;At this point, there's nothing but speculation (about intervention) because the dollar is hanging in there so well,&quot; Michael D. Andrews, vice president and foreign exchange economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, said.    The chief trader at a major New York bank with close ties to the Fed also expressed doubt.    &quot;It's not like we're on virgin territory right now,&quot; he said, as the dollar remains well above its 1987 lows of about 137 yen and 1.76 marks. Many traders expect the central banks to be generally tolerant of fluctuations above those levels.    In the absence of intervention, traders said, the dollar's losses were probably curbed by buying to take profits on other currencies' gains.    Although many traders say the dollar should continue to fall because of the huge U.S. trade and budget deficits, they are wary of doing too much selling because that might prompt major central banks to again come to the currency's defense.    Central banks of the U.S. and its major allies are believed to have spent about $90 billion on currency market intervention in the first eight months of this year. Most of that activity was aimed at supporting the dollar in connection with the Louvre accord reached in Feburary in Paris.    In that accord, the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada agreed to act to stabilize the dollar's value against other major currencies. Although the seven nations never acknowledged agreeing on an exchange-rate range, market participants believe the nations are trying to keep the dollar trading at about 1.80 to 1.90 marks and about 140 to 150 yen.    &quot;The market is still a little wary of taking on the central banks,&quot; Irving's Mr. Andrews said.    The dollar will face a further test today in Asian markets when Japanese investors get their first opportunity to fully scrutinize exchange rates in light of the U.S. trade report. Traders generally are pessimistic about the dollar, and some predicted even before yesterday's news that it would fall to 1.75 marks and 135 yen by the end of this month.    &quot;With the bond market so weak and the stock market so weak, I would think there will be a continuation of the dollar's weakness,&quot; Alfred Driever, vice president, foreign exchange, at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, said. &quot;For the next few days, I believe the market will try to sell the dollar down,&quot; he said.    The dollar was quoted at 142.42 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Although the efforts of the Group of Seven are widely credited with keeping the dollar relatively stable for most of this year, market sentiment is building up to send the currency lower.    Even if the central banks do intervene, Mr. Holzer of Harris Trust said, they might have difficulty preventing the dollar from declining.    &quot;Right now, it looks like the end of the world for the dollar, given the trade picture and overall outlook,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.70 an ounce to $460.80 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.00 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                   Wednesday, Oct. 14, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
