The spring-summer of 1988 in fact marks the return of theminiskirt with hemlines so short they make Mary Quant's versionlook dowdy.   Champions of the new micro-mini are the Italian ready-to-weardesigners who propose a variety of styles from ruffled to pleatedto draped and puffed. Fabrics range from sexy leather to demurecotton and sensuous silk, but the hemline always hovers closer tothe thigh than the knee.   For those with scant pocketbooks, the best investment for thesummer 1988 Italian style is a pair of good scissors to lop offlast year's hemlines. However, the fortunate few with a fat bankaccount _ and a skinny figure _ have an infinite variety of ministo chose from.   Giorgio Armani, the ``Numero Uno'' in the classic tailoring ofthe famed made-in-Italy label, prefers to keep his summer hemlinesa discreet several inches above the knee in supersoft draped skirtsand culottes. Gianfranco Ferre, on the other hand, strays from histraditional line to offer the tightest shortest skirt of the season_ a black patent leather number which barely covers the buttocks.   Gianni Versace, who previewed the return of the mini with adaring winter skirt dubbed the ``postage stamp'' for its minuteproportions, offers a minidress with wide-hooped skirt andtight-fitting bodice reminiscent of an inverted champagne glass,while Krizia proposes gaily polka-dotted evening minidresses.   Along with the miniskirt, the Italian designers dreamed up amyriad of sugary sweet party dresses, in pretty floral chintz andruffled lace, matched with wide-brimmed straw hats complete withfloral corsage and demure white gloves _ for the delight of theyoung, or at least the young at heart.   The great risk, in fact, of the new Italian ``moda bambina'' isthat it fall into the hands or onto the bodies of the over-aged andover-sized.   Byblos is the best place to find this romantic youthful look,with its jeans dresses decorated with lace frills, and its manyfloral printed mini party dresses with hooped skirt.   Another label that favors the party dress is Fendi, designed byextravagant Karl Lagerfeld. His petticoated floral printedminidress with oversized puffed sleeves and matching wide-brimmedhat is so young looking it would be a hit at a birthday party for3-year-olds.   Armani also picked up on the party theme in his evening wear,designing gaily printed and ruffled floor length evening gowns,with enticing bodice, and puffed petticoated skirt, reminiscent ofa fairytale milkmaid.   Fortunately, the Italian designers never forget that theystarted out a decade ago as the inventors of the tailored classicallook, and therefore along with the minis and the party dresses theyoffer plenty of elegant outfits for summer office and city life _Laura Biagiotti's pastel colored linen safari suit, and navy andwhite striped cashmere pullover; Basile's ankle-length rose printedshirt waist cinched at the waist by a wide brown belt, and Jenny'sfeminine plaid blazer and cropped black and white floral printedjacket.   On the whole, jackets were man-tailored and long, sometimescovering the scanty attire below.   The place to look for an overall fashionable spring-summer of1988 is Armani who, while taking inspiration from the new trends,did not sacrifice elegance and wearability for creativity.   The new Armani look is based on a very simple daytimesilhouette: a classic polo shirt or the newer fencing blouse, apair of loose trousers or a gently draped skirt or culotte onlyseveral inches above the knee, and either a man-tailored doublebreasted blazer, or a V-necked jacket, all in super soft fabricsand delicate pastel shades.   Summer colors come right out of a box of watercolors: peachapricot and rose, acqua blue and green, cream and beige. Brightfruit shades such as grape, cherry and raspberry, or lemon, orangeand lime are cheerful alternatives.   High heels are back again, to put even more distance between thehemline and the floor, but there are also plenty of comfortableflat daytime sandals.   Italian designer clothes were never cheap, but rising costs inItaly and the falling dollar have made prices soar almost as muchas hemlines. An Armani outfit made up of jacket, shirt and trousersor skirt rings up to the shocking figure of over $2,5OO, butcompared to $600 for a Ferre mini only 10 inches long, it ispositively a bargain.</TEXT></DOC>
