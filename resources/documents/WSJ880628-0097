Bell Canada, Canada's largest telephone utility, is a unit of BCE Inc., Montreal.    A Bell Canada spokesman said that the utility is replacing the striking workers with management personnel but that delays are being experienced in maintenance and with operator-assisted calls.    The strikers are members of the Communications Workers of Canada. Their contract expired last November.    Issues in dispute include wages, contracting out, the use of part-time employees and pensions, the company spokesman said. No talks are planned.    The union's negotiating committee accepted Bell Canada's contract offer in April but the employees rejected the pact in a membership vote. </TEXT></DOC>
