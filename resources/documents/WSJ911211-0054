Under the plan, high-school studentswould receive $40,000 in college-tuition loans, which wouldbe forgiven by the federal government if they served aspolice officers for four years after college graduation.   On behalf of more than 135,000 rank-and-filepolice-officer members in the U.S., the National Associationof Police Organizations, which I head, and other policegroups lobbied against the police-corps bill, and continue tooppose it for the following reasons:</LP><TEXT>   1. A major but dubious assumption of the police-corps billis that having college graduates enter police service forfour years after graduation would improve the quality ofpolice protection and service. But it is normally only afterat least four years that police officers are considered tohave enough seasoning to avoid errors resulting frominexperience. Therefore, the departure from police work ofpolice-corps recruits after four years would forfeit theirbest potential years of police service. And as any employerknows, employee-turnover costs always are substantial.   2. Mr. Walinsky's idea that the police corps would be acheaper way of providing police protection becausepolice-corps recruits would be gone after four years issimilarly wrongheaded. Under the police-corps proposal,members would receive the same employee benefits as otherpolice officers. Therefore, contrary to Mr. Walinsky's claimthat they would not be around to collect a pension, pensioncontributions would be made on their behalf and their pensionrights might very well vest. But even if savings wereinvolved, they would come at the cost of employingless-experienced officers.   3. Another erroneous assumption is that there currentlyexists a national problem in recruiting qualified policeofficers. In fact, there have been well-publicized policelayoffs across the country in recent months as a result ofstate and local governmental fiscal crises.   As far as the need for better-educated police officers isconcerned, a law-enforcement scholarship bill to helprank-and-file police officers obtain associate, bachelor'sand graduate degrees has been introduced in Congress. Underthe bill, working police officers would be eligible forfederal and matching state scholarship assistance. Thisapproach has far more to be said for it than Mr. Walinsky'sill-conceived police corps.   Robert Scully   President   National Association of Police Organizations   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
