In the Baltics, activists responded to a Kremlin attack on theirdrive for independence. On Saturday, the Communist Party CentralCommittee criticized the nationalist movements as leading the regioninto an ``abyss.''   National deputies from Latvia, in a telegram to President MikhailS. Gorbachev, said the Central Committee statement had spread``disinformation to the population of Latvia and the world, causingobstacles for perestroika and the republic.''   ``We expected this,'' said Raimona Sakalouskis of Sajudis, theLithuanian movement.   Nikolai Raiyulanu of the Moldavian People's Front said 250,000 to300,000 people jammed Victory Square in the Moldavian town ofKishinev, holding flags and banners boosting ethnic demands.   The Soviet evening news showed a crowd overflowing in the square,which was a sea of red, yellow and blue Moldavian flags.   The Tass news agency said Moldavian President Mircha I. Sneguraddressed the crowd and appealed for calm discussion of a law makingMoldavian the official language, which will be considered by therepublic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Tuesday.   He said the proposal ``does not infringe on the rights of othernationalities living on Moldavian territory,'' Tass reported.   About 2,000 members of a group called Unity, which is comprisedmostly of Russians, Ukrainians and other minorities in the republic,held a rally nearby, Raiyulanu said in a telephone interview fromKishinev. They passed a resolution calling the proposed law aviolation of their rights, Tass said.   Tass also said a third rally was held, this by thousands ofGagauzi, a Christian Turkish minority group. The Gagauzi, meeting inKomrat, also were protesting that the language law infringes ontheir right and the rights of other minority groups, Tass said.   The rallies came amid a wave of strikes at more than 100factories and offices in Russian- and Ukrainian-dominated citiesprotesting the proposed language law.   Strikers have demanded that the Moldavian government allow moretime for discussion of the law. Its final draft version waspublished in the official press on Aug. 20.   The law would make Moldavian, a dialect of the language spoken inneighboring Romania, the official language. It would also restorethe Latin alphabet that the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin replacedwith Cyrillic when the Soviet Union forcibly took the land fromRomania in 1940.   Leaders of the People's Front see the adoption of the languagelaw as vital to protecting Moldavian culture. They are one of manySoviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy fromthe Kremlin.   The Moldavian activists view the language law as a first step ina program modeled on the Baltic republics' more radical program ofpolitical and economic autonomy.   More than 1 million residents in those three northwesternrepublics linked hands last week in a giant chain to protest aSoviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the Soviet annexationof the three states. One Baltic republic, Estonia, has declaredpartial sovereignty from Moscow.   Saturday's official message from the Communist Party'spolicy-making body accused ``separatist elements'' of whipping up``nationalist hysteria'' and appealed for an end to their push forsecession.   In its own response, the People's Front organization in Latviaacalled for restraint among Latvians. ``Let's be united and calm,and not give in to the provocation,'' it said.   Sources said the Latvian Communist Party's Central Committeewould hold a special meeting on Wednesday to discuss the declaration.   On Sunday, the national Communist Party daily Pravda said theneed for a Moldavian language law was obvious.   However, it said the debate over the law had raised other, moreextreme demands that worried the non-Moldavian speaking minority andprompted its protests.   ``All the more often at rallies of the People's Front, you hearslogans like `Moldavia for Moldavians!''' the newspaper said.   It said some people in the Moldavian republic were even talkingof seceding from the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
