In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arsenal Holdings Inc., a National Amusements unit, said it made an offer to a special committee of Viacom's board to acquire the company in a transaction that some Wall Street arbitragers valued at about $49.25 a share. The Viacom management offer is valued at about $47 a share.    Viacom declined comment. But Wall Street reacted favorably to the new offer, which will be financed by bank debt, rather than by the &quot;junk bond&quot; financing that the management offer relies on. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Viacom shares closed at $43.875, up $2.50.    As previously reported, National Amusements, of Dedham, Mass., has been accumulating stock in Viacom since last October, and currently holds a 19.6% stake in the cable, entertainment and broadcasting concern. National Amusements' offer consists of $37.50 a share in cash, a partial share of a new issue of preferred valued at $7.25 a share, and an equity stake in a new company formed by National Amusements.    The National Amusements offer largely mirrors the structure of the Viacom management offer. But National Amusements is offering 50 cents more a share in cash, and 25 cents more per share in the preferred. More significantly, under the National Amusements offer, shareholders would receive a 20% equity stake in an acquiring company valued at $400 million. In the Viacom offer, the acquiring company in which holders would receive the 20% stake is valued at only $81 million.    According to Wall Street arbitragers, the equity stake in the Viacom management offer is valued at about $3 a share, while the equity stake in National Amusements's offer adds at least $4.50 a share in value to the transaction.    National Amusements, a theater chain operator, said it will need about $2.65 billion to complete the merger. It said the funds will consist of $400 million in common equity, consisting of cash and National Amusements' stake in Viacom common stock, and $2.25 billion in bank financing. In a letter included in the National Amusements SEC filing, BankAmerica Corp., San Francisco, said that it will provide $592 million of the $2.25 billion in bank financing and said it is &quot;highly confident&quot; of its ability to syndicate the rest with other banks.    Viacom currently has about $900 million in debt, which would have to be refinanced. But Viacom would also take in about $330 million from the conversion of warrants. Including the debt, the total value of the National Amusements plan is about $3.1 billion, compared with about $2.97 billion for the management plan.    In a letter to Viacom's board, Sumner Redstone, president and owner of National Amusements, maintained his offer is significantly better than management's because &quot;it provides a higher aggregate price, more cash and exchangeable preferred stock, a much more valuable continuing public equity interest in the company,&quot; and &quot;a more secure financial structure which is not dependent on junk bond financing and which we anticipate will save the company tens of millions a year&quot; in interest payments.    National Amusements, which has been advised by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said in its filing that it has also retained New York investment banking concern Allen andamp; Co., which is frequently involved in entertainment company transactions.    The Viacom management buyout group includes Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., First Boston Corp. and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. A spokesman for the group said it isn't clear that the National Amusements offer is a sweeter one, &quot;since we have to assess the value of the deal in terms of timing.&quot; He asserted that it could take months for National Amusements to get required regulatory clearances for the change of ownership in Viacom's cable and broadcast properties. By contrast, sources close to Viacom said, the management group is close to completing all the necessary regulatory clearances.    The buyout group spokesman added that the extent of the bank commitment isn't clear from the filings, and that it appears that National Amusements' plan would require asset sales even if it doesn't include junk bond financing at present. &quot;We still have a lot of questions,&quot; the spokesman said.    Sources close to the group expressed concern that Mr. Redstone would fire Viacom's management if he gets control of the company. They cited passages in the SEC filing such as one in which Mr. Redstone accuses management of entrenching itself at the expense of shareholders and breaching its fiduciary duty. But in a telephone interview, Mr. Redstone said that although management &quot;has done a lot I sharply disagree with,&quot; Viacom's chairman and chief executive officer, Terrence Elkes, &quot;in many respects has done a fine job.&quot; Mr. Redstone added that he didn't expect an &quot;exodus&quot; of management from Viacom should he gain control of the company.    Mr. Redstone also denied that he plans to sell Viacom assets. &quot;This is a buy-and-hold scenario,&quot; he said.    Alan Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Bros., said the National Amusements offer is &quot;better capitalized&quot; and &quot;on the surface appears to be much closer to the private market value of Viacom.&quot; Mr. Kassan recently valued Viacom's assets at $50 a share, but said that that value is increasing as a result of the escalating worth of Viacom's cable properties. Mr. Kassan said, &quot;the ball is back in management's court&quot; to come up with a better offer.    However, some on Wall Street said they doubted Viacom management would be able to make a better offer, noting that the company has already sweetened its offer three times. &quot;I think (Mr. Redstone) has got them beaten on this,&quot; said one arbitrager. </TEXT></DOC>
