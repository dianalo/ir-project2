BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Phil Gramm stunned his colleagues recently by suggesting that his own brainchild, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, be transformed into a plan to put off the budget-deficit problem, rather than one that rushes to solve it.    The Texas Republican, one of the most fiscally conservative members of Congress, proposed to halve the amount of deficit reduction for this fiscal year to $18 billion. In the end, he came about as close to getting his way as he could expect; after prodding by Democrats, the new target was set at $23 billion.    Despite all the rhetoric that will be devoted to the federal budget over the next few weeks, the tough decisions have been deferred. Indeed, really significant reductions in the budget deficit aren't mandated by the new law until 1989 -- when President Reagan is out of office.    &quot;What we've done is postpone the inevitable problem of reducing the deficit until the next president takes office,&quot; says Rep. Robert Matsui (D., Calif.), who helped draft the new law. Adds Rep. Donald Pease (D., Ohio): &quot;We are delaying for two years any serious deficit reduction.&quot;    Deficits for each of the next two years are projected in the range of $180 billion to $190 billion if reductions aren't put in place. But the revised Gramm-Rudman law requires cuts of only a small fraction of that total: $23 billion from projected levels this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and as little as $5 billion to $10 billion in additional savings next fiscal year.    &quot;These are modest numbers,&quot; says Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), a respected budget expert. &quot;It keeps us treading water rather than sinking.&quot; The revised law was designed to do little more than keep the deficit for each of the next two years from going above the about $155 billion that it reached last fiscal year. But some economists suggest that the amount of mandatory budget cutting in the next two years is so small that it could be wiped out entirely by a relatively minor slowdown in economic growth. What's more, the $23 billion in savings are to be measured against a budget base line that has been inflated for assumed cost increases.    This isn't to say that this year's deficit reduction will be painless. Indeed, if President Reagan and the Congress fail to reach a compromise on a deficit-reduction package by Nov. 20, starting then the Gramm-Rudman law will cut the budget across the board by $23 billion or slightly more -- equally divided between military and nonmilitary programs. &quot;In some of these accounts,&quot; says Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.), &quot;we'd be taking a hurting hit.&quot;    In recent days, a handful of lawmakers have begun complaining that Gramm-Rudman's across-the-board cuts would be harmful. Though several poverty programs are exempted from the automatic cutbacks, Democrats assert that social spending programs would be hardest hit, especially education, housing and health. Military advisers to the president worry that the armed forces budget would again be kept from growing or even reduced slightly, which would set back the president's plans.    &quot;A whole range of programs -- including both domestic programs and defense -- will be pushed in front of the buzz saw and big pieces will be cut off,&quot; warns Chairman Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.) of the Senate Budget Committee. The average cut in military programs -- excluding personnel, which is exempted -- would be 10.4%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nonmilitary programs, with several poverty programs and Social Security exempted, would be pared 8.7%.    There is a reason for the shouting. All of the cuts would come from only about 20% of the $1 trillion federal budget, and, except for defense, those are the parts that have been pared most severely in the past. Fully four-fifths of the budget is exempted from Gramm-Rudman.    The big lesson from this year's exercise, lawmakers say, is that more than that 20% will have to be looked at in the future if major deficit reduction is to be achieved. Specifically, they say, taxes would have to be raised and middle-class entitlement programs, notably Social Security and Medicare, would have to be trimmed. A major reduction in the deficit &quot;is very, very difficult without the next leadership putting everything on the table,&quot; says Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee.    In the meantime, there are those who contend that any budget cutting is better than none. &quot;We should all be applauding this,&quot; asserts Robert Reischauer, a budget specialist at the Brookings Institution, a think tank here. &quot;It's about all that an economy that is not burning along should really absorb.&quot;    But significant deficit reduction will have to wait until President Reagan leaves office. The president continues to resist tax increases and major cuts in military spending, despite the Democratic Congress's intention to try to enact both. The modest deficit targets in the new Gramm-Rudman law are largely the result of this standoff.    Democrats had hoped to force the president to accept a tax increase by threatening to reduce his cherished military buildup with a rejuvenated Gramm-Rudman law. But that threat was diminished when the amount of automatic cutback was reduced to $23 billion from $36 billion. Both Republicans and Democrats feared that any larger reduction would be politically too painful to accept if the president stubbornly refused to agree to anything that would avert the automatic cuts. Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) calls the new Gramm-Rudman law &quot;the lowest denominator&quot; of budget cuts.    For now, Democrats in both the House and Senate are moving toward adopting a deficit-reduction package that trims both military and nonmilitary spending less than a full Gramm-Rudman cutback, and also raises taxes about $12 billion. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the Ways and Means Committee believes that, in the end, the president will accept the package, or something like it, rather than take an automatic Gramm-Rudman cut.    &quot;He's going to fight and kick and scream and holler,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski says. &quot;But when they wake him up, I think the president will take the lesser of two evils.&quot;    Another alternative being discussed on Capitol Hill is that the president will accept some budget cuts and minor tax increases, and then allow a partial across-the-board cutback under Gramm-Rudman. &quot;I don't think they've decided yet&quot; at the White House, says Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee.    A third possibility is that the entire deficit-reduction effort could be undone, either through supplemental appropriations or legislative fiat. &quot;The process,&quot; says Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio), &quot;isn't foolproof.&quot;    ---             Gramm-Rudman Maximum Deficit Targets            (Fiscal years, in billions of dollars)                    1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993 Original target    $108   $ 72   $ 36   $  0    ---    --- New target          144    136    100     64   $ 28      0    Note: Projected deficit in fiscal year 1988 must bereduced by a minimum of $23 billion. In fiscal years 1989through 1992, the projected deficit that Congress approvescan't be more than $10 billion greater than the targetamount.</TEXT></DOC>
