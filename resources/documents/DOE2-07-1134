When DSA resultswere negative (13 cases), results of conventional angiography were alsonegative. Upper GI bleeding episodes could be managed solely with DSA,which shortened examination times by 20% - 35%. The usefulness of DSAin lower GI bleeding was limited in the authors' series by a 9-inch imageintensifier and misregistration caused by bowel motion.</TEXT></DOC>
