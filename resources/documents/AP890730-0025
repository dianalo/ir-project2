GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign ministers from the United States, theSoviet Union and other countries opened an international conferenceSunday with a call for a comprehensive peace settlement inCambodia, but the warring parties stuck to their entrenchedpositions.   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk repeated hiscalls for a four-party interim government that would include thewidely detested Khmer Rouge.   His chief rival, Prime Minister Hun Sen of the pro-HanoiCambodian government, charged that Khmer Rouge participation wouldonly ``open the door for them to return to power or provoke a civilwar no one could limit or control.''   The conference, aimed at bringing an end to Cambodia's20-year-old conflict, opened with statements from leaders of 11 ofthe 20 delegations, nearly all appealing for an end to theSoutheast Asian nation's trauma.   ``The occupation should end. The violence should end. Thesuffering should end,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III.``We know the path to Cambodian internal reconciliation is likelyto be long and arduous. But today we take the first steps.''   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze called for acease-fire in Cambodia even before all the Vietnamese troops haveleft, and for an international body to monitor the withdrawal.   He also called for practical measures to stop outside militaryassistance to all the warring groups.   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, the co-host of theconference along with Indonesia, opened the meeting, declaring itwas ``now possible and urgent to bring an end to one of the mostmurderous, unjust conflicts in history.''   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ending a Khmer Rouge ruleduring which hundreds of thousands of people died in executionchambers and slave labor camps. Vietnam installed another communistgovernment in Phnom Penh.   As the conference began, two Japanese Buddhist monks chantedoutside the turn-of-the-century International Conference Hall, ablock from the Arc de Triomphe. They banged drums and offeredprayers for the meeting's success.   Hun Sen announced that only 26,000 Vietnamese troops remained inhis country and reiterated earlier promises that all would be outby the end of September.   Vietnam's current troop strength in Cambodia has been estimatedby Western analysts at 60,000 to 70,000.   Sihanouk renewed his charges that Vietnamese soldiers andcolonialists would in stay in Cambodia, and he said the risk of hiscountry remaining a Vietnamese protectorate was greater than thethreat from the Khmer Rouge.   The Paris conference is the first among all involved parties,which include Sihanouk's three-party guerrilla coalition and itschief arms supplier China, as well as the Hun Sen government,Vietnam and it's main backer, Moscow.   Echoing one of the points of general agreement among thespeakers, Baker said the Khmer Rouge ``should play no role inCambodia's future.''   However, he said Washington was willing to support Sihanouk'sinclusion of the Khmer Rouge, one of the parties of his loosecoalition, in an interim arrangement. He further qualified theposition by saying the actual Khmer Rouge leaders responsible forthe deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians could never beallowed to return to power.   ``The strength of our support for any Cambodian government,however, will directly and inversely depend on the extent of KhmerRouge participation, if any, in that government,'' Baker said.   Baker said an international monitoring body under U.N. auspicesshould be set up to monitor the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,ensure interim stability and ensure free and fair general elections.   No new proposals to end the conflict were presented by the 11delegates who spoke on the opening day of the conference. Scheduledto address the monthlong conference Monday were the representativesof China, Vietnam, Japan and the Khmer Rouge.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar suggested afact-finding mission travel to Cambodia as soon as possible to laythe groundwork for a monitoring body.   Cambodian guerrillas said Vietnamese troops backed by artilleryfire have been trying to retake Khmer Rouge guerrilla positions inwestern Cambodia near the Thai border.   A report heard Sunday in Bangkok from guerrilla radio said theattacks showed Vietnam ``was not withdrawing even an inch from theborder'' and did not want a peace settlement.   The radio reported attacks recently on three areas of Battambangprovince bordering Thailand's Prachinburi and Chantaburi provinces_ south Sisophon, Sisophon-Phnum Malai and Pailin.   According to Thai military officers, pro-Vietnamese forces haveintensified shelling of guerrilla positions in the past week.   Officials said the attacks could be intended as a show ofstrength during the Paris talks.</TEXT></DOC>
