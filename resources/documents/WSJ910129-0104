Apple said FCC approval of its petition would open up anew era where computers transmit and receive data over radiowaves without the aid of wires.</LP><TEXT>   Other computer companies also are working on transmittingdata via radio waves and have been given use of limitedfrequencies by the FCC. Apple, however, said it wants the FCCto allow computer communications exclusively on 40 megaherzof the radio frequency bandwidth, between 1850 and 1990, totransmit data at high speeds over distances of as much as 150feet.   &quot;We believe it is essential that computer users haveaccess to this vital communications resource in the future,&quot;said John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, in astatement.   Earlier this month, another Apple executive disclosed thatthe company was developing a portable &quot;companion&quot; computerthat would send data to a host, desktop computer over radiowaves. Michael Spindler, Apple's chief operating officer,said Apple hasn't decided to introduce such a product, butthat he believed it was technically feasible and couldbenefit businesses and schools by allowing people to takeadvantage of computers on the move, within their offices orschools. The device would work much like a remote televisionchannel changer, sending data to a desktop computer in thesame way a remote control switches channels to skip acommercial.</TEXT></DOC>
