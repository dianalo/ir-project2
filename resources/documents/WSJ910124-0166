The companies blamed consumer misunderstanding.   Both companies maintained that they had been sensitive toprivacy concerns in developing Lotus Marketplace: Households,a compact disk containing shopping habits and personal dataon 120 million U.S. households from the Equifax data base.But, they said, the product was a victim of &quot;public concernsand misunderstanding.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The product &quot;is at the apex of an emotional firestorm ofpublic concern about consumer privacy,&quot; said Jim P. Manzi,chairman and president of Lotus. &quot;The cost and complexity ofeducating consumers about the issue is beyond the scope ofLotus as a software provider.&quot;   C.B. Rogers Jr., president of Atlanta-based Equifax, said&quot;despite our significant consumer education efforts, consumermisperceptions about this new product offered through thisdistribution channel persist.&quot;   The two companies said that they had planned to limitsales &quot;only to legitimate businesses,&quot; and kept personalinformation on credit history, age, telephone number andexact income out of the data base.   Nevertheless, privacy advocates feared that the data wouldbe unusually accessible, because Marketplace was designed tobe purchased by businesses that could then search it with anApple Macintosh computer equipped with a compact disk reader.Currently businesses obtain data base information indirectlythrough third parties such as Atlanta-based Equifax.   Lotus also said it would discontinue Lotus Marketplace:Business, a similar product with information on seven millionU.S. businesses. That product has been selling since October.Lotus said it continues to sell its other compact disk databases, which include a variety of financial and marketresearch data.   Lotus declined to say how much money it had spent on theproducts, which had been in development for two years.</TEXT></DOC>
