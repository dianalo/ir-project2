The top objective of the five oil ministers on the committee seems to be to keep petroleum prices from falling any further and wait for the usual seasonal increase in demand for oil in the fourth quarter. Even though world oil markets have been in a lull awaiting the outcome, neither OPEC sources nor industry analysts expect much of consequence from the two-day meeting.    &quot;These ministers are trying to keep things where they are,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on OPEC affairs. &quot;But short of calling an extraordinary (emergency) ministerial conference, there isn't very much they can do.&quot;    A senior OPEC official yesterday all but ruled out the possibility of an emergency meeting of all 13 member nations before the scheduled ministerial conference in late November. &quot;There's a very slim chance of any extraordinary meeting,&quot; he said.    The official said, however, that several major topics are due to be discussed by the price committee. He listed excessive production by some OPEC members, the problem of bringing Iraq back into the system of output limits, the debate over defining oil-like condensates, which currently are excluded from quotas, and whether to consider reducing official prices in view of the lower actual prices for oil. He said the five ministers won't decide any of these issues but are only to lay the groundwork for their resolution.    OPEC continued, meanwhile, to refuse to disclose the site of the meeting. However, several sources have said the talks will be in Madrid, and at least two of the five ministers have reserved hotel rooms in the Spanish capital for this weekend, according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report.    But with the word having leaked out about Madrid, there were reports yesterday that OPEC might make a last-minute change. OPEC spokesmen confirmed that the ministers want to meet away from media attention. &quot;They just want to talk in peace and quiet,&quot; one spokesman said.    Analysts said, however, that the ministers' desire for secrecy could backfire. &quot;They seem to be signaling to the market that they don't expect to come up with anything,&quot; said Humphrey Harrison, director of energy research at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat andamp; Aitken andamp; Co. &quot;If they now meet in Madrid, and 100 journalists are in the corridor, it's a double negative; it confirms OPEC cannot keep a secret.&quot;    Others said the fact that OPEC is being secretive about the location leads to higher expectations about the outcome. As a result, prices might fall even more rapidly if nothing conclusive is announced after the meeting, they said.    Oil markets yesterday remained relatively flat, with some prices up slightly. On European spot markets, North Sea Brent crude prices were up about five cents a barrel in light trading. On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery closed at $14.65 a barrel, up nine cents. </TEXT></DOC>
