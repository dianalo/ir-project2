Magistrate R.K. Gauba said Satwant Singh's complaint amounted``to reopening the judgment in the Indira Gandhi murder case,'' saidUnited News of India.   In a complaint filed Oct. 10, Satwant Singh said two members ofMrs. Gandhi's security force fired at him after he was captured anddisarmed.   He claimed he shot Mrs. Gandhi inadvertently in an attempt toshoot down who he said were the real assassins _ the two policemenwho fired at him.   Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, in the garden of herofficial residence by Satwant Singh and a fellow Sikh bodyguard,Beant Singh.   In resulting shooting, Satwant Singh was severely injured andBeant Singh was killed. The two men were not related.   After an eight-month trial in 1986, Satwant Singh was convictedof murdering Mrs. Gandhi and sentenced to death.   Beant Singh's maternal uncle, Kehar Singh, was convicted ofconspiring with the assassins and also got the death penalty.   ``It is most unnatural that Satwant would have hidden truth ofthis nature throughout the trial of a case where his own life was atstake,'' Gauba said, according to United News of India.   Singh's lawyer, Rupinder S. Sodhi, said he would appeal.   Mrs. Gandhi apparently was shot and killed in retaliation for anarmy raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'holiest shrine. It was used as a base by militant Sikhs fighting foran independent homeland in the Punjab. At least 1,200 people, mostlySikhs, died in the assault.   Militant Sikhs have waged a bloody guerrilla war since 1982. Theyclaim they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus.   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's population but arein a slight majority in Punjab.</TEXT></DOC>
