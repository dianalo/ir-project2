With five presidential candidates racing around the state in afinal day of campaigning, Jesse Jackson was buoyed by a pollsuggesting he may have pulled even with fellow favorite son Simon.   ``On the eve of a significant breakthrough ... with your help,we the people can win Illinois,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd ofabout 1,800 in Carbondale, Ill. ``I tell you, we the people willwin.''   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, lying third, sought a goodenough showing to keep up some momentum from Super Tuesday. Overand over on Monday, Dukakis hammered at Simon's contention that theDemocratic convention will be deadlocked.   It ``would be a disaster'' for the Democrats to end the primaryprocess without a nominee-to-be, Dukakis said, with ``negotiating,dealing, people behind closed doors trying to decide who thenominee ought to be.''   Dukakis apparently wasn't the only Democrat wanting to avoid abrokered convention. Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk suggested Mondayhe would try to rally uncommitted delegates behind whichevercandidate is leading the field at the end of the primary season, ifnone has a lock on the nomination.   Kirk said in a telephone interview from New York that he didn'twant to ``leave the impression that Kirk's going to be the broker''but said he would be ``in the middle'' of efforts to avoid hurtingthe nominee with a battle just before or during the convention.   The problem for Dole was much more immediate than theconventions, months away in the summer. The Kansas Republican waslooking for a way to keep his campaign alive in the face of astring of Bush victories.   ``It's not over for Bob Dole,'' he told the Executives Club ofChicago.   Later, at a news conference, Dole repeated his determination tocontinue beyond Tuesday: ``I've made a judgment that Illinois,whatever happens, we're going to keep going.''   The Kansas senator said he had ``made some inroads'' againstBush in Illinois, but that there had not been enough time to stopBush's surge after a 16-state win last Tuesday.   ``You want to elect momentum or elect the better candidate?'' heasked the Executives Club audience. ``Maybe it's going to take acouple of weeks for everything to sort of slow down.''   But the Illinois outlook for Dole was not good.   A Chicago Tribune poll said Bush was the choice of 62 percent ofthe likely GOP voters in Illinois, with only 28 percent for Dole.   Such a strong showing could give Bush a big chunk of the 82Republican delegates at stake in Illinois. Added to his currenttotal of 705 delegates, it could give him more than 60 percent ofthe 1,139 needed to win the nomination at the GOP NationalConvention in New Orleans in August. Dole has 165.   Despite the numbers, Bush told a reporter that suggestions hehas locked up the nomination are premature.   ``I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' Bushsaid as he flew on Air Force Two from Chicago to Springfield, Ill.However, when asked if he were surprised that Dole was staying inthe race, he replied: ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.''   On the Democratic side, Simon was facing the reality that he hasto win the Illinois primary to keep even his stripped-down campaignalive until the Democratic National Convention in July.   ``I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' he said in Chicago. ``Ihave to win and I will win. But obviously Michigan and Wisconsincome next.''   And second place isn't good enough.   ``A strong second isn't very strong,'' Simon told a reporter. Ifhe does end up in second place in either delegates or the popularvote in Illinois, he said, ``I'd have to reevaluate.''   One poll published Monday in the Chicago Tribune suggested Simonfaces the possibility of a second-place finish.   The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, said 32 percent oflikely Democratic voters supported Jackson, 29 percent backed Simonand 20 percent said they would vote for Dukakis. Rep. RichardGephardt of Missouri was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. AlbertGore Jr. of Tennessee had the backing of 4 percent.   The poll, conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates,interviewed 500 people and had a potential margin of error of 5percentage points.   An ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll published in Tuesday'seditions of the Post gave Simon the lead with 39 percent support toJackson's 34 percent among very likely Democratic voters. Dukakishad 17 percent with Gore and Gephardt far behind. The potentialsampling error in the survey, conducted Saturday and Sunday, wasplus or minus 6 percentage points.   Going into the Illinois primary, Dukakis held the lead in theAssociated Press delegate count, with 463 to 424 for Jackson. Gorehad 353 and Simon just 36.   A total of 173 delegates are at stake on the Democratic side inIllinois.   One Dukakis goal is to win some of those delegates, a difficulttask given the complicated nature of the state's ballot. Voters notonly cast ballots for presidential candidates, they also votedirectly for delegate candidates. Thus, a vote for Dukakis in the``beauty contest'' portion does not necessarily mean a vote for himin the delegate selection process.   Another goal, Dukakis aides said privately, is to narrow theDemocratic field. Mentioning the polls showing Dukakis drawing hislast-minute support from Simon's voters, the governor's aides saidthey would be delighted to see Jackson beat Simon, believing itwould drive the senator from the race.   Republican Pat Robertson was to be in Washington on primary day,where he planned to meet with the visiting Israeli prime minister,Yitzhak Shamir. The Robertson campaign characterized it as ameeting of ``two old friends.''</TEXT></DOC>
