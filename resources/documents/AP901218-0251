KALISH</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar fell moderately against most foreigncurrencies Tuesday in a flurry of trading prompted by along-awaited move from the Federal Reserve Board to lower its keybank lending rate.   Gold prices were mixed.   However, traders said the dollar's decline was cushioned by thecontinued potential for a war in the Persian Gulf to disruptforeign economies heavily dependent on imported oil.   ``In a normal market (the drop) would be a lot bigger,'' saidWalter Simon, vice president at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co.   The central bank's lowering of the discount rate from 7 percentto 6.5 percent, effective Wednesday, had been expected for sometime. But traders took it as a further indication of the slumpingU.S. economy, which generally erodes the dollar's value againstforeign currencies.   ``Action was taken against the background of weakness in theeconomy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetaryaggregates,'' the Fed said, in announcing its first discount ratereduction since August 1986. A decrease in the Fed's discount rateoften signals that other short-term loans such as adjustable-ratemortgages and car loans also will become less expensive.   ``This is displaying to the market the lack of confidence in theeconomy the Fed has,'' said Simon.   Traders said the dollar displayed its greatest weakness againstthe German mark amid a trend of rising interest rates in thatcountry.   They speculated that some European economies may move this weekto firm up their interest rates to stabilize their currenciesagainst the German mark. This could further weaken the dollar.   ``The market's response has been stronger buying marks insteadof selling dollars,'' said Chris Mendell, a vice president atSecurity Pacific National Bank.   The dollar closed at 1.4780 German marks in New York, down fromlate Monday's 1.4870. In Europe, the late dollar rate was 1.4840German marks, down from 1.4867 late Monday.   The dollar decline on the Fed's move came after an earlierweakening on the worst U.S. monthly trade deficit numbers in almostthree years. The government reported that the trade deficit climbedto $11.61 billion in October, the biggest imbalance since February1988.
