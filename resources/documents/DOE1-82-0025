The effects ofthe barrage on estuary water levels and velocities are used to calculatethe energy output from the two sites including the effects of high waterpumping at the Cardiff-Weston site. The same set of results is used toassess the changes to the movement of sandy sediments that might arisewith the English Stones scheme.</TEXT></DOC>
