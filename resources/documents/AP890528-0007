Disputes over certain job-classification titles and exactcontract language covering some areas of agreement blocked asettlement. But, believing an agreement was at hand, the two unionsagreed to bargain overnight and terms of contracts due to expirejust before midnight Saturday were extended until further notice.   ``It's a speck we expect to work out,'' a company official saidof the final dispute. ``We think we'll have it done by daybreak(Sunday),'' a union official said.   In the overall agreement being worked out by American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph and the unions was a wage and profit-sharing packagethat should bring workers raises of more than 10 percent over threeyears, a source said. It is the first time ATandamp;T has offered profitsharing to its union workers.   The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said theunions had fought off ATandamp;T's demand that workers pay more up frontfor health care costs, the issue that dominated the talks fromtheir outset in March.   ATandamp;T won concessions allowing it to amend certain job titles andthereby expand the duties of certain workers, the source said.   Also included was a package of parental, family and elder-careleave provisions. The family and elder-care provisions would allowworkers to take six months off to care for a sick parent, spouse orchild without losing seniority, the source said. ATandamp;T wouldcontinue health insurance during the leave, the source said.   And, in a proposal ATandamp;T offered on the final day in hopes ofbrokering a settlement, the company agreed to create a fund tosupport new and existing child care centers. The company-union fundreportedly would total $5 million.   If the remaining disputes are resolved, union and companyofficials plan a joint news conference Sunday afternoon.   An agreement would avert a possible holiday weekend strike byATandamp;T's union workers, although the unions had not been expected toimmediately call a strike even if there were not an agreementSaturday.   The new contracts would be subject to rank-and-file ratificationand would replace contracts with the Communications Workers ofAmerica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workersthat expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday.   It appeared as late as Saturday afternoon that no agreementwould be reached by the deadline as sources on both sides reportedlittle movement on the health insurance fight.   But by early evening there was renewed optimism, spawned byprogress made in a series of private meetings between ATandamp;T's topnegotiator and two ranking union officials.   Those sessions led to progress at the formal bargainingsessions, and as the existing contracts entered their final hoursboth sides said an agreement before the deadline was possible.   But both sides girded for a possible walkout nonetheless.   ATandamp;T had several thousand managers on alert, their bags packedin case they were dispatched around the country to replace strikers.   The unions used computer networks with locals across the nationto update members on the status of the talks and plans forimplementing a nationwide labor boycott of ATandamp;T long distance hadunion leaders _ in the event no agreement was reached _ picked thatstrategy instead of an immediate strike.   A strike would have been the third against ATandamp;T in nine years.IBEW workers did not honor CWA's 1986 strike, allowing ATandamp;T to keephalf its manufacturing plants open. The two unions negotiatedjointly for the first time this year.   The talks, the largest single-employer collective bargainingsession this year, took on added significance because they willaffect negotiations later this year for nearly 500,000 unionworkers at regional phone companies. Also, major corporationsseeking to curb soaring health care costs were eager to see whetherATandamp;T could pass some of the bill to workers.   The unions were determined to prevent the company from slicingits $1 billion annual medical bill at the union workers' expense,and from the start of the talks demanded expanded benefits whilepromising to work with ATandamp;T on cost-control measures they saidwould save millions of dollars.   Job security was the third major issue behind health insuranceand wages, and ATandamp;T made a significant concession in that area onFriday by offering to limit its use of temporary workers.   That and other developments brought the first reports ofsignificant progress with little more than 24 hours remaining inthe existing contracts.   Negotiators returned to the bargaining table at a Washingtonhotel Saturday after just a few hours of sleep.   Overshadowing their work were periodic private meetings amongCWA President Morton Bahr, Thomas Hickman, a top aide to IBEWPresident John Barry, and ATandamp;T's top negotiator, Raymond Williams,the company's vice president for labor relations. Those sessionswere the key to breaking the impasse over health insurance.   ATandamp;T's initial wage package, presented formally on Monday,included base wage increases and lump sum payments for bothoperating and manufacturing employees and the company's firstprofit-sharing plan for union workers.   Included in that proposal was the company's demand thatemployees be required to pay 20 percent of doctors and hospitalbills _ up to $1,000 a year in addition to deductibles _ and 25percent of the premiums for dependent care. ATandamp;T employees do notcurrently pay for dependent care and pay only annual deductiblesranging from $150 to $300 for medical care. ATandamp;T said it needed theincreased worker contribution to cut an annual medical bill of $1billion.   According to company estimates, the negotiations affected about21,500 long-distance operators, 35,500 in-house and fieldtechnicians, 37,000 manufacturing employees and 54,000 otherpersonnel in clerical, administrative, sales and other positions.</TEXT></DOC>
