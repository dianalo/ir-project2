Some oncogenes such assis seem to function at the onset of this cascade by directing synthesisof an automitogenic growth factor. Others such as erbB and fms appearto function at subsequent steps of the cascade by directing synthesisof a growth factor receptor or a structurally altered receptor derivative.Still other oncogenes such as myc, fos and perhaps myb are mutated orrearranged homologs of proto-oncogenes whose expression is normally inducedby growth factors. The interface between growth factors and oncogeneshas been widely publicized even within the lay community, and no serioustumor biologist can now be unaware of it. The purpose of this articleis to draw attention to an interface of another sort--between growthfactors and interferons. This newly discovered relationship may ultimatelybecome more exciting and have more practical consequences than the onebetween growth factors and oncogenes.</TEXT></DOC>
