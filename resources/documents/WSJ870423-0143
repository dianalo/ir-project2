The discussions could lead to a joint venture between the two companies that would give each concern access to its partner's market to supply equipment and services to the nuclear industry, these sources said.    Neither company would comment officially on the talks. But sources familiar with the discussions say that they aren't yet in a decisive stage, and that the two companies are examining &quot;eventual cooperation in a certain number of domains, including forming a joint venture.&quot;    The sources wouldn't elaborate further, but Framatome is said to be seeking entry to the U.S. market to sell nuclear fuel and supply maintenance services for nuclear power plants. For its part, New Orleans-based Babcock andamp; Wilcox, a unit of McDermott International Inc., could supply equipment and fuel for French nuclear power plants.    McDermott, also based in New Orleans, declined to comment.    If an agreeement is reached, it would be the latest sign of a change in strategies by nuclear power plant builders to overcome the recession in the nuclear power industry.    With orders for new nuclear power plants becoming rarer, the builders are focusing increasingly on offering service and maintenance services and are abandoning their go-it-alone strategies to enter foreign markets. Recently, for instance, Framatome agreed to join forces with its arch-rival Kraftwerk Union AG of West Germany to conduct a feasibility study to build a nuclear power plant in Indonesia.    Although Framatome recently reported that its profit rose 18% in 1986, it has been affected by the slowdown in France's domestic nuclear power program and by a sharp decline in international orders.    In announcing the 1986 results, the company said it would pursue a two-pronged strategy: remain a major force in the nuclear power business by expanding its service activities, and diversify within the next two years into non-nuclear activities. An agreement with Babcock andamp; Wilcox, by expanding Framatome's geographic base, would fit into the first part of its strategy. Framatome officials say it's difficult to enter the U.S. market without a solid local base.    Babcock andamp; Wilcox also has been hit by the slowdown in domestic orders, and has run into trouble with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which last year ordered a major safety review of Babock andamp; Wilcox-built nuclear reactors after two serious accidents in 1985. For the year ended March 31, 1986, Babcock andamp; Wilcox had sales of $1.75 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
