The analysts predicted that the move would send a variety ofconsumer and business interest rates lower, with one saying that acut in commercial bank's prime lending rate could come as early asMonday.   ``The Fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we havepassed the peak on interest rates,'' said David Wyss, an economistwith DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.   The development was not unexpected, although some economists weresurprised that the move came even before the end of two days ofmeetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of membersof the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the 12regional Fed bank presidents.   The committee meets eight times a year to map monetary strategyand many had expected that the central bank would begin anotherround of easing moves in the period following this week's meeting.   At the previous meeting, held on May 16, Fed policy-makersdecided to leave credit conditions unchanged. They noted a varietyof economic statistics pointing to slower growth, according tominutes of that meeting released Friday.   The ``no-change'' decision was adopted on an 11-1 vote withThomas Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,dissenting. Melzer argued that unless the central bank easedimmediately it ran the danger of increasing the possibility of arecession.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal details ofthis week's discussions when he delivers the Fed's midyearassessment of the economy in congressional testimony on July 20.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said the Fed is acting because agrowing number of business barometers confirm that economic growthis slowing.   The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation'sunemployment rate climbed to 5.3 percent in June, reflectingcontinued declines in manufacturing and construction. The uptick inthe jobless rate follows other statistics showing weak auto sales, aplunge in orders for manufactured goods and lackluster retail sales.   Jones said he expected the looser credit environment would meanthat banks will cut their prime lending rate, perhaps as early asMonday. Banks dropped the prime to its current 11 percent in earlyJune. The prime rate, traditinally considered a benchmark forbusiness loans, now influences a variety of consumer loans,including home equity loans.   Economists based their belief that the Fed is easing credit on aslight decline in the federal funds rate, which edged down 0.25percent to 9.25 percent in the past two days.   The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each otherto make overnight loans, is influenced by daily decisions thecentral bank makes on how much money to make available to thebanking system. It is considered the best early-warning signal ofFed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions.   The funds rate first dropped on Thursday to the 9.25 percentlevel and it held at that lower level on Friday, convincing manyeconomists that the central bank had eased. It would mark the secondmove toward lower interest rates in recent weeks.   The funds rate had dropped from 9.75 percent to 9.5 percent inearly June.   Greenspan and the other members of the Fed have been underpressure from Congress and the administration to let interest ratesfall as a way of keeping the economy out of a recession.   The Fed has been struggling to engineer a soft-landing wheregrowth slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but without arecession.   Wyss said he believed the odds were still 2-1 that the centralbank would be successful in avoiding a recession this year.   ``The Fed seems to be on track for a soft-landing,'' Wyss said.He said Friday's unemployment report was particularly encouragingbecause it showed that average hourly earnings, a good barometer ofwage pressures, showed only a moderate increase last month.</TEXT></DOC>
