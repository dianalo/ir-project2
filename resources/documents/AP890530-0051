A Chinese source said an important Communist Party CentralCommittee meeting scheduled this week was postponed becauseconservatives did not have enough backing for their purge ofmoderate leaders.   Those believed to be targets of the conservatives include thereform-minded Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang, who reportedlywas stripped of power last week by Premier Li Peng.   Students occupying central Tiananmen Square continued to snub Liand his supporters, unveiling to the cheers of tens of thousands a33-foot replica of the Statue of Liberty.   The ``Goddess of Democracy'' immediately drew an angry responsefrom Beijing authorities, who said the students' action wasillegal. They ordered the statue removed immediately.   ``This is China, not the United States,'' the nationwidetelevision news quoted one unidentified person as saying. ``Even inthe United States, putting up a statue in front of the Congressbuilding as one pleases is not permitted.''   Conservatives who adopted a hard-line stance toward thepro-democracy protests have started arresting non-studentparticipants.   Three union officials and 11 leaders of a motorcycle gang, whichroared through the city in support of the students, were reportedarrested.   Zhao Pinglu, head of the Beijing Independent Workers' Union,said one of its leaders, Shen Yinhan, a 27-year-old official withthe national airlines, was grabbed by police Monday in front of theBeijing Hotel.   Two other union leaders, both employees of the Ministry ofRailways, also were arrested, Zhao said.   Li Zhihuang, wife of railway employee Qian Yiming, said herhusband's work unit claimed he was arrested by police ``to find outabout the situation at Tiananmen Square,'' where students arecontinuing an 18-day sit-in for a freer society and an end toofficial corruption.   A third man, Bai Dongping, 26, was supposed to take his wife tothe hospital on Monday but did not show up, said his father. BaiBaofa.   ``He would never just disappear,'' his father said. ``Thegovernment's actions are vicious.''   About 1,000 students and workers protested outside policeheadquarters near the square. One banner read, ``Do not secretlyarrest people. Let the people know.''   Outside police headquarters, a man who identified himself aschief of Beijing Public Security told a U.S. television crew therethat no students had been arrested. He refused comment on whetherworkers were detained.   The official told the journalists they had violated martial law,imposed May 20 in a bid to quash the student-led movement. He saidthe television crew should not talk with any Chinese in the centralBeijing area under the decree, which has been widely ignored.   A police broadcast to the crowd said, ``You do not understandthe real situation. Beijing is in complete chaos.''   When an officer told the crowd to disperse, they replied withcalls of ``bandit'' and ``rascal'' and ``how many people have youarrested?'' Police with two video cameras filmed demonstrators, whosaid they would not leave.   The independent trade union, which claims 3,000 members, wasformed May 19 in defiance of a government ban on all but theofficial trade union federation.   The party hardliners who appear to have won a power struggleoccasioned by the student protests have taken the line that thestudents are well-intentioned but that non-students who aremisleading them will be punished.   Already, workers who have joined demonstrations or supported themovement are being fined or having their pay docked. Others arebeing threatened with losing their jobs.   Several hundred student protesters from outside Beijing saidthey would return home today to spread the movement's gospel. Butthousands more said they would stay in the now foul-smelling squareuntil the country's legislature convenes June 20.   About 5,000 students are now living in a squatters' camp on thesquare, China's symbolic center of power.   Student leaders have continued to quarrel over the direction oftheir movement. Beijing leaders had favored ending the occupationtoday but were overruled by other activists, many of them fromoutside the capital and relatively recent arrivals.   Representatives from about 200 schools met early today on theissue but failed to iron out differences.   Chinese and diplomatic sources claim more troops are being movedto Beijing as part of the behind-the-scenes power struggle.</TEXT></DOC>
