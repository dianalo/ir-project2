JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imported cars dominate both the best and theworst categories in the annual survey of automobile gas mileagereleased today by the Environmental Protection Agency.   Overall, automakers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the1990 model year, although the number of cars _ mostly expensivesuper-luxury imports _ that trigger the federal ``gas guzzler'' taxdropped from 40 car types to 30.   ``There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of thetop 10 1990 models compared to the top 10 1989 models. Likewise,overall fleet average fuel economy of all cars and light trucks ...is projected to be about the same,'' said the EPA in a statement.   Fuel economy has gained renewed attention in Congress because ofconcern over autos' role in causing global warming and air pollution.   Automobile emissions, especially carbon dioxide releases, are adirect contributor to urban smog, which has caused more than 100metropolitan areas to fail federal air quality standards. Carbondioxide also is a major cause of the so-called ``greenhouse effect''which scientists say is expected to cause a warming of the earth incoming decades.   According to the EPA survey, the mileage leaders were largelyforeign-made with the Japanese dominating that end of the list.   For the fifth straight year the fuel-stingiest car was theJapanese-made Geo Metro, sold by Chevrolet, followed by the HondaCivic CRX, Suzuki Swift and Daihatsu Charade. The Geo Metro XFImodel had mileage of 53 mpg in the city, 58 mpg on the highway, and55 mpg overall, the same as last year.   No U.S.-made car made the top 10 list. The Ford Escort had thebest mileage of any domestic car with 32 mpg in the city, 42 mpg onthe highway and 36 mpg overall.   The car with the worst mileage was the Lamborghini Countach whichgot only 6 mpg in the city and 10 mpg on the highway. Rounding outthe list of 10 cars with the worst gas mileage were four models ofthe Rolls Royce, the Ferrari Testarossa, BMW 750IL, Porsche 928 S4;Audi V8, and Maserati 228.   According to the EPA survey, all but two of the 30 car modelssubject to the gas guzzler tax are luxury imports. The exception aretwo Cadillac models, the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubicinches) Brougham, which have combined city and highway mileage of 18and 17 mpg, respectively. They had the worst gas mileage of anydomestic car.   Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last yearescaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models. Theseincluded the Chrysler TC by Maserati and the Chrysler New Yorker andDodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler models that fellunder the guzzler tax in 1989.   European models that are subject to the tax come from Maserati,Rolls-Royce, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Volvo, Audi and BMW.   The excise tax amounts to a penalty of $500 to $3,850, with theamount increasing as gasoline mileage declines. It was enacted in1975 to encourage people to buy more fuel-efficient cars.   The mileage results are based on tests conducted by themanufacturer under laboratory conditions with about 30 percent ofthe tests verified by the EPA, according agency officials.   Automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5mpg for their fleets. Last year officials in the Reaganadministration urged Congress to eliminate the fleet requirements.But the Bush administration, citing environmental concerns, hasurged automakers to continuing pursuing increases in the fleetaverages and efforts to rescind the standards have fallen by thewayside.   Legislation introduced in the Senate would call for a 40 percentimprovement in fleet-wide fuel economy by the year 2000. Such arequirement, which has been opposed by the auto industry, wouldrequire a fleet average of about 40 mpg by the turn of the century,industry officials have said.</TEXT></DOC>
