 For people who needdedicated sessions with continuous access to host applications, this worksjust fine.andM;For occasional use, however, such as when only E-mail access is required, aMac-to-AS/400 gateway is more economical.andP;  With a gateway installed, one Maccan theoretically support as many as seven host sessions, which can be sharedon an AppleTalk network.andP;  (Seven host sessions is the maximum allowed over atwinaxial connection.)andM;The gateway approach is attractive because it saves users from having toinstall a terminal-emulation card in their machines or run additionaltwinaxial cabling between their Macs and the AS/400.andP;  Also, the pooledsessions allow more than seven users to share the host links, by connectingand disconnecting as required.andM;Andrew KMW Systems Inc. became the first vendor to provide a Mac-to-AS/400twinaxial gateway by introducing its NetAxcess product in June.andM;Overall, PC Week Labs found that NetAxcess is a fine Macintosh implementationof an AS/400 gateway and stands to be economical when serving groups of userswho need occasional access to an AS/400.andM;The product does fall short of Mac ease-of-use standards for file-transfercapabilities, however.andM;NetAxcess software includes several programs, including NetAxcess, theAppleTalk component that lets the gateway service the LAN; TwinAxcess, whichconfigures the 5250 terminal-emulation card; LANaccess, theworkstation-to-AppleTalk component that lets the workstation gain access tothe network; Inter Access, the emulation program installed in eachworkstation; and File Axcess, a demonstration HyperCard stack.andM;NetAxcess uses a Mac II NuBus 5250 terminal emulation card installed in thegateway machine to provide the twinaxial connection to the terminalcontroller.andP;  Because NuBus cards are self-configuring, users do not have toset dip switches or jumpers, making installation a snap.andM;Installing terminal-emulation software in the AS/400, the gateway Mac and theworkstation Macs demands coordination between the host technicians and theMac user.andP;  The AS/400 terminal controller must be installed with theappropriate resource lists on the host, and the twinaxial cable must be runfrom the controller to the Mac II gateway machine prior to installation ofthe NetAxcess hardware and software.andP;  PC Week Labs used a remote AS/400terminal controller for testing purposes.andM;To install the twinaxial card configuration and network-sharing software intothe Mac Control Panel, users drag the TwinAxcess and NetAxcess icons into theMac System Folder and reboot the Mac.andM;The next step requires installation of the IBM EBCDIC fonts, using AppleComputer Inc.'s Font/DA mover.andP;  This step was mentioned only in the NetAxcessRelease Notes addendum, instead of the main section of the manual, which mayconfuse some users.andM;Once the fonts are moved, restarting the Mac makes the fonts active.andM;Selecting the Mac Control Panel under the Apple Menu starts the gatewayconfiguration process.andM;Clicking on the TwinAxcess icon allows configuration of the seven sessions onthe NuBus emulation adapter.andM;For each session the user assigns a terminal or printer model to one of theAS/400 controller station addresses.andP;  An optional password can be tied toeach session.andM;Andrew KMW does not include a provision for duplicating a session betweenstation addresses.andP;  This feature would make setup easier when many sessionsare configured the same way.andM;After setting up the sessions using TwinAxcess, the server must be activated.andO;This is accomplished by clicking on the NetAxcess icon and selecting theServer Status &quot;on&quot; button.andP;  Closing the Control Panel completes the gatewayinstallation.andM;PC Week Labs found that installing and configuring NetAxcess closely followsstandard Macintosh procedures, and the process should be easy for most Macusers.andP;  Configuring the AppleTalk-connected Macs proved equally intuitive.andM;Users drag the LANAxcess icon into their system folder, move the Inter Axcessemulation software onto the desktop or into a folder, and then install theIBM EBCDIC fonts using the Apple Font/DA mover utility.andP;  Restarting the Macinstalls LANAxcess into the Mac's Chooser.andM;Each Mac user can start a session by opening the Mac Chooser under the AppleMenu and selecting a NetAxcess server, then double clicking on the InterAxcess icon and selecting a session name.andP;  A session already in use indicateswhich user holds the session; any selection that can not be used is grayedout.andM;Once a user invokes a session, a Mac window opens with the host screenrepresented.andP;  Andrew KMW's software gives users many options for sizing,overlapping and adjusting the view and appearance of single- andmultiple-host sessions.andP;  On a large Mac display, all seven host sessions canbe viewed in their entirety by choosing the small window image.andP;  In addition,when session windows are sized, the Inter Axcess software provides forauto-scrolling within the window.andP;  Showing a partial screen doesn't limit thefunctionality of the session.andM;PC Week Labs found that NetAxcess file transfers were difficult to carry outand much less intuitive than other parts of the package.andM;This is because Macintosh-based programs developed to substitute for IBM'sAS/400 PC Support package are not currently up to par with IBM's program.andM;PC Support is a series of integrated programs that provides data transfer;terminal emulation; office integration; and file, print and communicationsservices.andM;It provides virtual disk, virtual print, shared folders, file transfer and amenued database retrieval mechanism, which builds SQL-like calls to AS/400data files.andM;The package currently sets the standard for file transfers and PC servicesbetween IBM midrange computers and workstations.andM;Non-IBM developers must either reverse-engineer the PC Support dialogue andface future incompatibilities with IBM's code, or create their own comparableproducts, with many of the same functions, from scratch.andM;Mac-to-midrange developers have chosen the latter alternative, which allowsthem to control both sides of the Mac-to-host conversation.andM;Unfortunately, these Macintosh programs do not offer the same level offunctions provided by PC Support.andM;NetAxcess uses the ETU (Emulator Transfer Utility)/400, which is sold byAndrew/Emerald, a subsidiary of Andrew Corp.andP;  The same software supportsstand-alone terminal 5250 emulation cards from Andrew KMW and Andrew/Emeraldfor both the Mac and the IBM PC.andM;PC Week Labs used ETU/400 version 4.3 for testing.andP;  The program takes up 9Mbytes of disk space on the AS/400, and is priced at $950.andM;ETU/400's host-based, menued user interface reveals its PC and midrangeorigins.andM;The screen prompts specifically ask for a drive letter for the PC file, forexample.andP;  This can be quite upsetting for the novice Mac user because thereare no drive letters in Mac terminology.andM;To Andrew KMW's credit, it supplies an application programming interface(API) to the terminal session that allows users to develop Apple HyperCardstacks.andP;  These stacks will let users access the host transparently andperform file-transfer functions without using the host-based menus.andP;  A seriesof external command calls and external function calls from HyperCard supportthe normal set of terminal emulation API functions.andM;Even with an API hiding the complexity of host menus from an end user,however, the calls behind the scenes are only as good as the functions builtinto the product, and NetAxcess falls short of direct interaction with Macapplications.andP;  Instead, the user must format, transfer and import files intoMac applications.andM;Ideally, a user should be able to select host data with the mouse and have itautomatically placed into a Macintosh application.andM;While IBM's PC Support does not provide the level of easy data interchangemost users would prefer, it does provide an easy way to select, project andjoin AS/400 files into a query that is executed and transferred to a PC.andP;  Incontrast, Andrew KMW provides no easy access to host data.andM;Overall, however, NetAxcess outshines IBM PC implementations of AS/400 accessby allowing multiple connections in different windows in a fully graphicalenvironment.andM;Current PC-to-AS/400 implementations will have to change significantly toprovide the same functions.andP;  In the future, a Microsoft Windows 3.0-basedPC-to-AS/ 400 product may bring the advantages of a graphical user interfaceto PC users, but for now the Mac reigns in the workstation-to-AS/400 arena.andM;NetAxcess provides a much-needed AS/400 twinaxial gateway for the Macintosh.andO;If Andrew KMW Systems can improve the product's file-transfer interface,using either its HyperCard API or extensions to Inter Access, it will bring ahighly competitive product to market.andM;Andrew KMW Systems Inc.*andM;Austin, Texas (800) 531-5167andM;Publicly heldandM;Year established: 1977andM;Number of employees: 120andM;1989 gross annual revenue: $18,000,000andM;1989 net annual earnings: $384,000 (supplied by company)andM;Source: On-Line DataSources.andM;*Information pertains to Andrew Corp.andM;Analyst's Note: Andrew Corp. recently acquired both KMW Systems and EmeraldTechnology Inc. Since both vendors have previously offered the same type ofIBM midrange terminal emulation cards for the Mac, a reasonable assumptionmight be that Andrew KMW would consolidate the product lines.andP;  Buyers shouldexpect a strengthening of Andrew KMW's Mac-to-AS/400 product in the futurebecause of this consolidation effort.andM;Unfortunately, however, Andrew's acquisitions of KMW and Emerald also narrowthe Mac 5250 emulation market to only two companies, Andrew and IDEAssociatesInc.andM;IDEAssociates isn't waiting for Andrew to make the first move.andP;  Version 2.0of its IDEAcomm Mac terminal emulation card and software includes afile-transfer process much like the database-selection process under IBM's PCSupport, which is quite intuitive and easy to use.andM;A Mac gateway product from IDEAssociates could prove interesting and keep thecompetitive spirit alive in this product arena.andM;----------Gary Gunnerson is the manager of end-user computing at a Fortune 500 company.andM;The full text of reviews from the last 12 months can be downloaded from PCWeek Extra! on-line service.andP;  For sign-up information, see Page 165.andM;PC Week Labs set up one Macintosh II as an AS/400 gateway using Andrew KMWSystems Inc.'s NetAxcess gateway product.andP;  The gateway Mac was tied bytwinaxial cable to a terminal controller, which was linked to an AS/400 by a9,600-bps synchronous line.andM;A Mac SE/30 served as the workstation that communicated with the NetAxcessgateway, using standard AppleTalk connectors.andP;  The gateway machine wasinstalled with Finder 6.1.4 and System 6.0.4 and 8M bytes of RAM.andM;The workstation system was installed with 5M bytes of RAM.andM;The AS/400 was installed with OS/ 400 version 2.0.andP;  It was also installedwith the emulator transfer utility ETU/400 from Andrew/Emerald, whichfacilitates Mac-to-AS/400 file transfers and other services comparable tothose provided by IBM's AS/400 PC Support program.andM;Transferring files over the NetAxcess gateway is a two-step process.andP;  Todownload a file, the file must first be converted from EBCDIC to ASCII, thentransferred from the AS/400 to a Mac.andM;The conversion process adds to the time required to transfer the file to theMac.andP;  File transfer alone approached the modem line speed of 9,600 bps, butwhen the time required to translate the file is factored in, throughput wasapproximately half that speed.andM;PC Week Labs downloaded a 181K-byte file.andP;  Translating the file from EBCDICto ASCII took approximately 1 minute and 57 seconds.andP;  The total transfertime, including translation time, was 4 minutes and 56 seconds.andM;PC Week Labs was unable to upload a file from a Mac to the AS/400 because ofunidentifiable problems within the configuration of the AS/400, the gatewayand the AppleTalk network.andP;  -- G.G.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
