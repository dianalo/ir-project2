The anticipated outcome is worth a $2 bet in world oil markets.    The price of crude oil at the New York Mercantile Exchange is expected to remain within a trading range of $13 a barrel to $14.25 until the cartel's oil ministers gather in Vienna Nov. 17 to begin a series of committee meetings before the full ministerial meeting four days later. Depending upon whether the ministers strike a production accord, the price of crude in the futures market could rise $2 a barrel or tumble at least $2.    &quot;Even if it's a semi-patched-up agreement, we should see almost $16 a barrel on WTI (West Texas Intermediate on the New York futures market) before year end,&quot; said Antonio M. Szabo, manager of petroleum planning, Bonner andamp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston. If there isn't an agreement, he added, the price &quot;will be at $11.50 in December.&quot;    Oil traders, by nature eternal optimists, are starting to wager that there's a good chance the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will hammer out an agreement as cartel members bow to the threat of continued overproduction by Saudi Arabia. &quot;The Saudis are going to the meeting armed to the teeth,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of international oil trading in London for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Gignoux was referring to an estimated 70 million barrels of stored oil the Saudis could unleash into the market if OPEC producers don't comply with the Saudi strategy that calls for production discipline.    Despite their rhetoric, many traders are staying on the sidelines until after the cartel meets. Although the crude oil pit at the New York Mercantile Exchange has been crowded with traders and brokers, at least half of them are just chatting with each other rather than trading, &quot;a clear sign that there's no strong industry buying,&quot; said R.B. Hoover, a broker for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. on the floor of the exchange.    But in support of the growing optimism within the trading community, there appears to be progress in shuttle diplomacy efforts to resolve the four sticking points that still divide the oil group. Production parity between Iran and Iraq continues to be the most contentious of the issues. Although the official public stance of the Iranian and Iraqi governments concerning that point continues to be in opposition -- Iraq demanding parity and Iran saying no -- individuals familiar with negotiations between the two Persian Gulf producers say their stances are softening.    &quot;The two cartel members, especially Iran, are very serious about finding a solution,&quot; said Mehdi Varzi, a former Iranian diplomat who is currently an oil analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London. &quot;They both know that if they fail and the Vienna meeting falls apart, oil prices will collapse to unbearably low levels.&quot;    If the Iran-Iraq issue can be settled, the remaining points of disagreement will become easier to resolve. The much-publicized issue of how to define crude oil output for quota purposes is evolving into a non-event. Wiping away another point of disagreement, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are prepared to include into their own quotas oil production from the neutral zone, which they had been jointly pumping to support Iraq's war effort against Iran. And if Iran and Iraq settle their differences, they may join Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in applying political pressure on the United Arab Emirates to stop flagrantly violating its quota.    Despite reports of slow progress, &quot;negotiations in Vienna are not going to be easy,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's new oil minister, said in a statement reported by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report.    Among OPEC's remaining oil ministers, most of the views currently being expressed border on deep pessimism. OPEC Secretary-General Subroto, the former Indonesian oil minister, last week repeated his prior warning of the possibility of $5-a-barrel oil unless the cartel succeeds in curbing its high production. Leading oil ministers echoed the warning.    Indeed, world oil fundamentals seldom have been more bearish -- even in 1986 when petroleum prices crashed. OPEC production is at a seven-year high. World oil inventories are said to be at a five-year high, an overhang that can become a burden for the oil exporters.    In other commodity markets:   Cocoa   After Friday's strong reversal of Thursday's decline, bullish traders were looking ahead to a meeting this week of the Cocoa Producers Alliance in Lome, Togo, which will seek ways to firm up prices. December cocoa rose $95 a ton Friday to settle at $1,403. Some traders attributed the rally to a report that has been circulating for several weeks saying the French government would help the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer, withhold 400,000 tons from the market. However, nothing was announced Friday to substantiate the rumor. Harry Schwartz, an account executive with Cargill Investors Services Inc. in New York, contended that both the Ivory Coast rumor and the producers' meeting were after-the-fact justifications seeking to explain the day's rally. The stage was set for New York action when trade buying in London drove that market higher, almost ensuring a higher opening in New York. Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber in New York, noted that December cocoa prices slipped below the prices on the March contract Thursday, reflecting weakness in current demand. He said traders this week should pay attention to the December-March price relationship, as any further weakening of December relative to March should raise questions about the authenticity of the current rally.    Precious Metals   The drop in U.S. unemployment announced Friday had some traders worrying that inflation might be rekindled. Although platinum prices fell early in the session after Japanese dealers said there is no shortage of the metal in that country, the January contract ended at $580.60 an ounce, up $2.90. PaineWebber's Mr. Savaiko said he thought the initial sell-off was only a technical move. &quot;The economy appears to be stronger than we suspect, based on the unemployment data released Friday,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, as long as the dollar is on the defensive, platinum and gold will look attractively priced in yen.&quot; Mr. Savaiko also said that if a recession came, platinum would be the hardest-hit of the three precious metals -- platinum, gold and silver -- because of its many industrial uses. He also said sellers were not aggressive in Friday's activity. &quot;Traders do not appear to want to be short over the weekend, nor going into the election&quot; tomorrow, he said.    Copper   Southern Peru Copper Corp. retracted on Friday a Thursday declaration in which it said it might delay some shipments because of a strike by Peruvian miners. The price of copper December delivery promptly slipped nine cents from Thursday's high, then rallied to settle at $1.42 a pound, down only 1.20 cents. But William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc., New York, said it doesn't make any difference whether the Peruvian concern, which is 52.3%-owned by Asarco Inc., New York, actually makes any such declaration or not. &quot;Traders should be following strike developments (this week),&quot; he said. &quot;That is what is going to determine the supply of copper.&quot; Don Tierney, metals analyst for Stanley Bell andamp; Co., New York, said the December contract's premium over the March contract has widened 10 cents a pound in the past month. &quot;In every sell-off we have seen&quot; in the copper market lately, he said, &quot;the December premium to March has not narrowed much, showing that there is still a strong demand for immediate copper.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
