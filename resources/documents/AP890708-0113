In the occupied territories, Arabs shot and killed twoPalestinians suspected of helping Israeli authorities, and Israelisoldiers reportedly shot and killed a Palestinian during aconfrontation with stone-throwers.   At least 22 Palestinians were injured in half a dozen clasheswith Israeli troops, according to Arab reports.   The army confirmed three fatalities and two woundings, and saidthe circumstances were under investigation.   Soldiers also searched several villages in the West Bank andconducted an unspecified number of arrests, an army spokesman said.   The four reported fatalities raised to 550 the number ofPalestinians killed in the almost 19-month-old Arab uprising againstIsraeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 33Israelis have been slain.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on the radio that hisgovernment would consider new measures, such as the death penaltyfor convicted terrorists, in response to the bus crash Thursday.Israeli law allows capital punishment for murder, but judges haverefrained from giving this penalty to Arabs, fearing possibleretaliation against Israeli prisoners held in Arab countries.   Fourteen passengers died when an Arab passenger screaming ``Godis great'' forced the bus into a deep ravine, where it caught fire.It was the worst assault on an Israeli target since the uprisingbegan.   Police described the passenger as a bearded man in his 20s fromNozeirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. Jerusalem policespokesman Uzi Sandori said the man was cooperating with Israeliinvestigators.   In Tunis, the Palestinian news agency Wafa described the busattack as a heroic prelude to a popular revolution.   ``This suicidal and heroic act is of a new type carried out by ayouth exasperated by the oppression of fanatics and the Israelisoldiers,'' Wafa said.   Meanwhile, Arab reports said that Palestinian motorist JamalNasir, 31, of Gaza City, was stoned to death and that fourpassengers in his automobile were injured. The automobile reportedlyoverturned on a highway near the southern Israeli desert town ofNetivot after rocks were hurled from a passing Israeli-owned car.   A police spokesman for the Negev desert region, Shalom Ben Hemo,confirmed the incident and said Nasir died at an area hospital. Hedeclined to say whether the assailants were Israelis.   Arab motorists also were stoned in Jerusalem's Shmuel HanaviQuarter, where police used tear gas in battles with dozens ofIsraeli militants who blocked a major traffic route, police said.   An Israeli man was injured by flying glass in one stoningincident and 15 suspects were detained, Jerusalem police spokesmanUzi Sandori said. Protesters also stoned the home of left-winglegislator Dedi Zucker, Israel TV said.   Arabs retaliated by throwing a firebomb at a border police jeepin the Abu Tor Quarter, Sandori said. No injuries were reported inthe firebomb attack.   In northern Israel, a group of Jews beat up three Arab teen-agerson a beach in the Caesaria coastal resort, also in retribution forThursday's bus attack, said a police spokesman for the northerndistrict, Gideon Arbel.   Another Palestinian, Mustafa Abed el Saed, 42, was killedSaturday when he was shot in the head and neck in Gaza City as herode his motorcycle to work at Gaza city hall, Arab reports said.The reports said el Saed was suspected of providing information toIsraeli authorities.   Palestinians also reportedly killed Ismail Hussein Al Ghoush, 55,of Yatta in the West Bank. Al Ghoush was shot in the abdomen bymasked men who broke into his home Friday night, Arab reports said.   In Gaza's Rafah district, soldiers shot and killed Ziad Zaki AbuOlwan, 20, after opening fire on stone-throwing demonstrators in amarketplace. At least nine of the 22 Palestinians wounded Saturdaywere injured in the Rafah confrontation, the reports said.
