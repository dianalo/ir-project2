(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three environmental groups filed suitTuesday to force the U.S. Department of Energy to prepare anenvironmental impact statement before restarting the three reactorsat the Savannah River Plant.   Restarting the reactors constitutes a ``major federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment,''according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington andannounced here.   Under terms of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, theEnergy Department must prepare an environmental impact statement ifsuch a condition exists, according to the suit.   In another development, The New York Times reported inWednesday's editions that a key advisory panel told the EnergyDepartment that its plan to restart the plant is flawed.   The department's principal scentific advisory committee said thereactor at Savannah River should not be allowed to return tooperation until more complete inspections and analyses are madeabout its ability to withstand a severe earthquake. Such study couldtake months, the newspaper said.   SRP is the only U.S. plant that produces tritium, a radioactiveisotope of hydrogen used to increase the explosive power of nuclearwarheads.   None of the three reactors at the 300-square-mile facility nearAiken has produced the critical weapons material since last Aprilbecause of scheduled maintenance and safety concerns.   Last month, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said continuingsafety questions would delay the restart of SRP until at least nextspring or summer.   Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and Energy andDefense Department officials have said that further idling of SRPcould endanger the nation's stockpile.   Frances Close Hart, chairwoman of the Columbia-based EnergyResearch Foundation, said Tuesday she did not believe anenvironmental impact statement would push back restart efforts.   ``Whether or not, if they started with an EIS now, it would delaytheir schedule, I doubt very much,'' she said at a news conferenceannouncing the suit.   The Energy Research Foundation was joined in the suit byGreenpeace U.S.A. and Washington-based Natural Resources DefenseCouncil.   Named as defendants were Herrington; Ernest E. Baynard III,assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health; andTroy E. Wade II, acting assistant energy secretary for defenseprograms.   DOE spokeswoman Christina Sankey said the department had met overthe past few weeks with representatives of the three environmentalgroups regarding an environmental impact statement.   ``While we did not reach an agreement, the department does intendto meet all of its obligations under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act,'' she said.   Ms. Hart said there were ways to recycle tritium that wouldstretch out the current supply. She also said a reduction in U.S.nuclear weapons would eliminate the urgent demand for tritium.   ``Anyone who proposes that we face a tritium crisis is eitherirresponsible or Dr. Strangelove,'' she said.   Ms. Hart said an environmental impact statement would aid restartefforts.   ``They can do it as quickly as they want to if they devote theenergy,'' Ms. Hart said. ``The reason we want to bring this suit andhave them begin the process is because they're obviously makingdecisions now.   ``They're making decisions every day, they're issuing reports andthe process of planning is moving along. The EIS should be part ofthat process. We don't feel they should go any further withoutstarting this process.''   The environmental groups are asking for an injunction that wouldprohibit the Energy Department from restarting the Savannah plantunless the agency conducts the environmental impact statement.</TEXT></DOC>
