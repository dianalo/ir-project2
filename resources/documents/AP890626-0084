RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal byan Illinois doctor ordered to pay $254,000 in lawyers' fees to thosewho successfully challenged a state abortion law.   The court, consistent with a ruling by the justices last week inan airline industry bias cae, let stand a lower court rulingstemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an Illinoisabortion-regulating law that included criminal penalties forphysicians who violated it.   A group of doctors sued various state officials, saying the lawviolated physicians' rights and those of their patients.   A federal judge barred enforcement of the law. Soon thereafter,Dr. Eugene Diamond and two others asked to intervene in the case asdefenders of the law.   Diamond said he was acting to defend his patients' interests andhis own professional interests.   Diamond and another doctor, who has since died, appealed to theSupreme Court in 1985 to overrule lower court decisions andreinstate the law. State officials dropped out of the case,declining to pursue it to the nation's high court.   The justices in 1986 ruled that Diamond lacked legal standing toappeal, thus leaving intact the victory won by the law's challengers.   A federal judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealssubsequently ordered Diamond to help reimburse the winners' legalfees. His share of the attorneys' fees, with interest, is $254,000.   The 7th Circuit court ruled last May that Diamond can be forcedto help pay the fees even though he did not violate theconstitutional rights of those who challenged the law. Only publicofficials and their agents may commit constitutional violations.   The public officials in the case were sued under a key civilrights law that authorizes reimbursement of attorneys' fees toencourage legal representation for those whose rights are violated.   Diamond and the others who intervened in the case in defense ofthe law ``for all practical purposes'' became the ``alter ego'' ofthe state officials, the appeals court said.   ``We cannot ... ignore the fact that the intervenors' unilateraldecision ... to join with the state defendants in adamantlydefending the constitutionality of the abortion act rendered themfull-fledged parties to the lawsuit,'' the appeals court said.   It added that the intervenors ``were thoroughly beaten'' innumerous court proceedings by the law's challengers.   The appeals court also rejected Diamond's arguments that forcinghim to help pay the other side's legal fees chills his free-speechrights.   A fee reimbursement system is not unlawful ``simply because itforces those who choose voluntarily to interject themselves intosuch lawsuits to think twice before engaging in battle,'' theappeals court said.   The case is Diamond vs. Charles, 88-664.</TEXT></DOC>
