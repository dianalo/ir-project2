VA officials said the increase reflects conditions in the private mortgage market, where rates are rising. The VA last raised the maximum home-loan rate April 4, when it rose a half point to 10%. In February, the VA lowered the maximum rate to 9.5% from 10.5%.    According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., lenders last week were asking an average interest rate of 10.52% on conventional fixed-rate mortgages, an increase from the 10.4% average rate a week earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    The average initial rate for conventional adjustable-rate mortgages with rates tied to one-year Treasury notes was 7.79% last week, up from 7.66% a week earlier, according to the Freddie Mac survey. Housing analysts have said they expect fixed mortgage rates to rise as high as 11.25% by year end. </TEXT></DOC>
