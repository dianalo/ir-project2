County NatWest Wood Mackenzie andamp; Co. of the U.K. andGermany's Berliner Bank AG are preparing to launch aclosed-end investment fund that will amass equity in newlyprivatized companies in the former East Germany.</LP><TEXT>   Berliner Bank said Friday that East German InvestmentTrust PLC will be listed in London Feb. 6 and later onBerlin's stock exchange. The sterling-denominated fund willbe opened for subscription between this Wednesday and Jan. 22and expects to raise between #75 million and #250 million($143.5 million to $477 million).   The fund's issuing price was set at #5 a share with aminimum purchase of 1,000 shares. Berliner Bank saidinvestors will be asked to pay 50% this month and the rest bythe end of the year. The fund will be managed by U.K.merchant bank Ermgassen andamp; Co.   The fund will become the second one of its kind on themarket. Last month, Robert Fleming andamp; Co. of the U.K. placedits mark-based Deutschland Investment Corporation Inc. fundtogether with Joh. Berenberg, Gossler andamp; Co., GulfInternational Bank and S.G. Warburg Securities. The fund,which has assets of 96 million marks ($62.7 million), issuedsix million shares priced at 16 marks each as well as 1.2million free warrants entitling the holder to one furthershare at 16 marks until the end of 1995.   The Germany funds that flooded the investment market afterthe opening of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 investedprimarily in West German companies that were expected to growrapidly on reconstruction orders from the east. But after afast start, the funds fell as the German stock market skiddedon the soaring costs of reunification of the nation,completed last year, and rising oil prices.   But managers of the eastern German funds contend that theonly direction their equity holdings can go is up. &quot;Theopportunity is in the uniqueness of {the former} EastGermany's situation, which we can assume will emerge from itslow point by mid-1991,&quot; said Hubertus Roll, a member ofBerliner Bank's new issues department.   But being among the first has its disadvantages. The fundrun by County NatWest and Berliner Bank aims to take minoritystakes in between 10 and 15 companies set for privatizationby the Treuhandanstalt German public trust, which controlseastern Germany's state-owned enterprises. So far, however,the investment company only has four prospects and doesn'texpect to be fully invested in the region's equity foranother two years.   Robert Fleming's fund, which is listed in the U.K. andIreland and seeks a listing in Berlin, is still invested inshort-term money market funds, pending the discovery ofviable candidates in eastern Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
