She will also be meeting President-elect George Bush to welcomehim into the ranks of Western leaders, of whom she is thelongest-serving.   Reagan came to office 1{ years after Mrs. Thatcher, and togetherthey have reinvigorated the long-standing special relationshipbetween the two countries.   But while Reagan is obliged to step down, Mrs. Thatcher faces nosuch constraints. Her present tenure lasts another four years, andshe has served notice that she will seek an unprecedented fourthterm in the 1990s. So the likelihood is that she will be workingwith Bush right up to 1992.   In a speech Monday night, Mrs. Thatcher thanked Reagan ``forending the West's retreat from world responsibilty, for restoringthe pride and leadership of the U.S. and for giving the West backits confidence ... in the success of free enterprise ... in thevalues which guide our societies.''   Mrs. Thatcher said Bush would be ``a worthy successor'' andadded: ``We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man ofunrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for allthat is best in America.''   Sharing a profound anti-communist ideology, distaste forwelfarism, faith in free markets and belief in negotiating fromstrength, Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher have managed to agree on most ofthe issues that have confronted them through the 1980s.   They have helped each other out at critical movements, and atgreat political risk _ Reagan by approving vital arms supplies andintelligence to Britain in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina,and Mrs. Thatcher by allowing the Reagan to use U.S. bombers basedon British soil to bomb Libya in 1986.   ``We must brace ourselves for a Niagara of mutual admiration,''wrote columnist George Walden of the conservative Daily Telegraph,previewing this last journey by Mrs. Thatcher to the Reagan WhiteHouse. ``The personal relationship has indeed been special.''   In the view of David Dimbleby and David Reynolds, in their recentbook on Anglo-American relations, Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher have``established one of the closest personal bonds in the history ofAnglo-American cooperation and breathed new life into the specialrelationship.''   Mrs. Thatcher arrives in Washington on Tuesday evening, and willhave talks with Reagan Wednesday, followed by a state dinner. OnThursday she will have talks with Bush, and return home Friday.   A foretaste of the emotional farewells in store came in June,when Reagan stopped in London en route home from the Moscow summitwith Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Britain had played a role in the Reagan-Gorbachev thaw. Mrs.Thatcher was the first major Western leader to visit the Sovietleader, and on his way to Washington to sign the arms-reductiontreaty, Gorbachev stopped in England for talks with the primeminister.   Reagan paid lavish tribute to Mrs. Thatcher's leadership, andMrs. Thatcher responded in kind.   ``You have restored faith in the American dream,'' the Iron Ladytold the Great Communicator. ``Your personal courage, your gentlehumor and your spirit of optimism are all part of the specialquality that you brought to the presidency.''   Replied Reagan: ``The entire world salutes you and your gallantpeople and gallant nation.''   Left-wing opponents call Mrs. Thatcher ``Reagan's Poodle,''claiming she doesn't make a move without his approval.   Mrs. Thatcher argues that the United States, as leader anddefender of the free world, must be heeded, and the specialrelationship is a pillar of her foreign policy.   They don't agree on everything. A believer in thrifty, debt-freehousekeeping, Mrs. Thatcher worries about the U.S. deficit. But shedoes not believe in criticizing the president outright.   ``I think she believes that we can only hope to influence theUnited States in private and affect their judgments ... if the basicrelationship is extremely good,'' says Sir Anthony Parsons, herformer foreign affairs adviser.</TEXT></DOC>
