BrownandM;Cupertino, Calif.andP;  -- The first internal feedback poll of Apple employeessince 1,500 workers were laid off last summer shows that Apple's staff issatisfied with working conditions but doesn't believe management has workers'best interests at heart.andM;The results of the Apple91 Pulse Survey were revealed in a memo sent fromApple CEO John Sculley and President Michael H. Spindler to all employeeslast month.andM;The memo described the survey, which was conducted by an independent researchfirm, as &quot;a true representation of the feelings of employees worldwide.&quot;andM;One-third of Apple's 14,000 employees were invited to participate in thepoll.andP;  According to the memo, 60 percent of those responded to the survey.andM;Apple generally received high marks from its workers for articulating clearbusiness goals, delivering superior products and creating a favorable workingenvironment this year.andM;The memo noted that respondents believe Apple made progress in meeting theneeds of education and individuals but has taken a step backward in itssupport of business and government customers.andM;The survey showed, Sculley and Spindler acknowledged, that &quot;overallsatisfaction in working for Apple has declined significantly&quot; during the pastyear.andP;  &quot;You believe,&quot; they wrote, &quot;that although we've made great strides infurthering our business goals, we've done this at your expense.&quot;andM;One longtime Apple employee said: &quot;Sometimes, I think that nobody abovemiddle management ever hears what it is we're saying.andP;  It's one thing to haveall this great hardware, but I wonder if Sculley really knows how tough it isfor us to deliver support for all this stuff since we've had no support staffsince the layoffs.&quot;andM;Intense pride in the company, coupled with feelings of insecurity aboutmanagement's commitment to employee advancement, also showed in surveyresponses.andM;&quot;The memo said that [management] finds our negative reactions unacceptableand that they want to communicate their understanding of our problems,&quot; saidone survey respondent.andP;  &quot;I'm just waiting to find out how they intend to dothis.&quot;andM;But, the respondent added, the real tragedy is that Appl` employees don'trealize how good they've got it and how great the future looks for thecompany compared with vendors such as IBM Corp. and Compaq Computing Corp.andM;&quot;There will be finger pointing until the problems are solved,&quot; said anotherrespondent.andP;  &quot;It's no longer Camelot here.&quot;andM;Officials at Apple refused to comment on the survey.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
