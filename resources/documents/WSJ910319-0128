The islands have been the source of a dispute since theywere seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.Japanese media have long speculated that President MikhailGorbachev would offer a deal on the islands when he visitsJapan in April. The Soviets have consistently denied any suchplans.</LP><TEXT>   The Soviet news agency, Interfax, said a settlement waspart of a peace treaty being worked out by the ForeignMinistry. The formula under discussion would return theislands of Shikotan and Habomai, Interfax said, but in returnJapan would have to renounce claims to Iterup and Kunashir.The report was attributed only to &quot;reliable sources&quot; close tothe Foreign Ministry.   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry called the report&quot;premature.&quot;   Moscow made a similar offer in 1956, when the two nationsestablished diplomatic relations. The offer was dropped whenJapan entered into an alliance with the U.S.   The return of any of the islands wouldn't sit well withSoviet hard-liners. Just last weekend, the islanders votedoverwhelmingly against handing over the territory. For itspart, Japan has long said it would only accept all fourislands, rejecting any partial solution.</TEXT></DOC>
