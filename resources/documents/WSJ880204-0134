Instead, the Crash of '87 has turned out to be a political dud.    &quot;It was an opportunity, but clearly it hasn't been developed to its full potential,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. &quot;I can't make a case that the crash has added a lot to Democratic prospects,&quot; agrees Terry Michael, communications director for presidential candidate Sen. Paul Simon.    One candidate, Rep. Richard Gephardt, is belatedly beginning to reap benefits from the stock-market debacle. The Missouri Democrat has garnered support in Iowa by pushing a strong populist message that attacks &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;the establishment.&quot;    But Democratic advisers continue to express disappointment at their candidates' failure to use the crash as a means for raising broader economic issues. In part, that may be because Wall Street's woes so far have had little effect on the economy. Some Democrats also argue that the party's candidates are reluctant to assault Wall Street because it figures so prominently in their fund-raising efforts.    At first glance, the 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 seemed custom-made for the Democratic party. It cast a long shadow over President Reagan's hands-off, free-market ideology, and gave the Democrats an opening to lay out a new vision of the government's role in managing the economy.    &quot;The imagery of the wheeler-dealer Wall Street 25-year-old has been tarnished,&quot; says Jeff Faux, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. &quot;It's a perfect time for Democrats to raise ideas and themes that reflect their perception of how to run an economy.&quot;    In fact, the event has sparked few changes in Democratic campaign strategies or policies. Concludes Mr. Faux: &quot;Nobody has made it coalesce.&quot;    Polling data support this conclusion. A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found that the percentage of Americans who think Ronald Reagan is doing a good job handling the economy has dropped noticeably, to 35% in January from 43% a year earlier. But a December Gallup survey shows that when voters are asked who can keep the nation prosperous, the two parties are in a dead heat -- with no change since January 1987.    The stock market crash, of course, has secured its place in the rhetoric of the Democratic candidates. Bruce Babbitt, for instance, criticizes President Reagan's response to the Oct. 19 market plunge by complaining that &quot;Nero fiddled; Reagan diddles.&quot; And Michael Dukakis frequently says that &quot;it's time to stop the gambling on Wall Street and start investing on Main Street.&quot; Moreover, in the wake of the crash, many candidates have increased their emphasis on the need for cutting the federal budget deficit.    But there is little evidence that the candidates have found any broader message in the stock market's collapse, or made major changes in their economic programs. &quot;At this stage, the Democratic contenders appear to be locked into automatic pilot,&quot; complains Alan Webber, managing editor of the Harvard Business Review and a Democratic adviser. &quot;They tend to just leave the stock market alone and go back to their basic script.&quot;    One reason Democrats haven't used the stock market collapse as an opportunity to attack the excesses of unbridled free markets is a fear, born out of the political experiences of the past decade, that they will be labeled opponents of economic growth. &quot;Democrats are still very shy of Reagan and of the anti-growth, anti-business image,&quot; says Mr. Faux.    Gov. Dukakis of Massachusetts provides a striking example. Although he campaigns on his competence in handling economic policy matters, he has done surprisingly little to take advantage of the issues raised by the crash. &quot;He doesn't want to run an anti-Wall Street campaign,&quot; explains his issues adviser, Christopher Edley. &quot;This is a guy who, if you name almost any social problem, from job training to homelessness to AIDs, one of the first things he thinks about is: 'How do I get the private sector engaged?'&quot;    Feeding that sentiment is the fact that Democratic candidates rely heavily on Wall Street for fund raising. &quot;Investment bankers are incredibly important to the Democrats,&quot; says Thomas Ferguson, a political-science professor at the University of Massachussetts at Boston. Prof. Ferguson has tracked the contributions of top Wall Street executives to congressional and presidential contenders, and found that for decades they have provided a surprisingly large base of support for Democratic candidates.    &quot;It's hard for me to believe the Democratic Party, which is, one is tempted to say, mortgaged to investment bankers, is going to use the crash as a popular issue,&quot; he argues.    An indication of the Democratic candidates' reluctance to bash Wall Street is their response to proposals for a &quot;transfer tax&quot; on securities, advocated by House Speaker James Wright and by Harvard Economist Lawrence Summers. None of the candidates has yet endorsed the idea.    Of all the Democratic candidates, Rep. Gephardt seems to have benefited most. Some political observers had thought Mr. Gephardt would suffer after Oct. 19. His tough trade bill, they feared, would be seen as the modern-day version of the Smoot-Hawley tariff that helped precipitate the Great Depression following the 1929 market crash.    Instead, Rep. Gephardt's advisers believe that his populist message has been given a boost by the uncertainty following the stock market collapse. &quot;It put the focus right on his message,&quot; says campaign spokesman Mark Johnson. &quot;Anything that brings front and center the economic challenges facing the country helps Dick Gephardt.&quot;    Jesse Jackson's message also has more appeal because of the crash. Even before Oct. 19, the Rev. Jackson was deriding President Reagan's &quot;perfect belief in an imperfect market, his blind belief in a system that is hardly blind&quot;; and he was criticizing large enterprises that &quot;merge corporations, purge workers and submerge the economy.&quot;    But Perry Quick, an economic consultant and former adviser to Gary Hart, says that none of the Democratic candidates has been able to convince voters that he has an answer to these problems. &quot;None of them,&quot; he says, &quot;has been able to generate an image of confidence or competence that he will be able to handle the situation in the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
