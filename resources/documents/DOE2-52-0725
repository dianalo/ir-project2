In aircontaining simultaneousLOCA environments, the remarkable dose rate and steam temperature effectswere found on mechanical and electrical properties and water sorptionof the materials, and the larger damage was observed compared with thosein the sequential environments. Increasing and decreasing rate of temperaturein a transient period, spray and aging conditions had small effects ondegradation of the materials. In sequential LOCA environments, pre-irradiationdose rate and environments affected strongly on the degradation, andthese effects became obvious under the presence of air in steam/sprayexposure. Further, aging conditions and spray were shown to have smalleffects on the degradation. (author) 57 refs. 265 figs. 45 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
