The proposed tax, known as the Goods and Services Tax, is an &quot;important part&quot; of the government's program, Mr. Wilson said at a news conference.    The tax, which is to have a rate of 9% and take effect Jan. 1, 1991, has encountered strong opposition from consumer groups, some business sectors and even some members of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party.    In a technical document issued yesterday, the government disclosed in detail how the tax would be applied to &quot;the vast majority&quot; of goods and services sold in Canada. The planned levy is similar to value-added taxes that have been introduced in more than 45 other countries in the past 20 years. Businesses throughout the production and distribution chain, including retailers, are to levy the new tax on their domestic sales. They may claim a credit for any tax paid on goods and services purchased for their business. The ultimate burden of the tax will fall on the consumer.    Mr. Wilson acknowledged that the new tax isn't &quot;popular.&quot; He said that consumers don't want to have to pay it, and that businesses don't want to have to collect it or have it applied to their goods. But he said the tax would provide substantial benefits, by replacing an outmoded federal sales tax that applies to only about one-third of goods and services.    The new tax will bring in estimated revenue of 24 billion Canadian dollars (US$20.49 billion) a year, compared with C$18.5 billion from the current federal sales tax.    The new tax won't apply to various financial activities, including brokerage services, securities dealing and underwriting. But it will cover services such as financial planning, investment advice and management services.    Mr. Wilson also confirmed that &quot;basic groceries,&quot; prescription drugs and medical devices won't be subject to the tax. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, which has supported the principle of a new value-added tax, said it was disappointed about &quot;the proliferation of exemptions,&quot; which make the tax &quot;more complex than we anticipated.&quot;    The government also disclosed details of a tax credit system, designed to prevent the burden of the new tax falling most heavily on low-income people. Families with incomes of less than 30,000 Canadian dollars (US$25,614) a year will be better off under the new sales tax system, because of the refundable tax credits, Mr. Wilson said. Many taxpayers will be eligible to use these credits to reduce their tax bills; for low-income Canadians who don't have any tax liability, checks will be paid automatically four times a year.    Mr. Wilson said the government will introduce legislation in the House of Commons this fall to implement the tax.    The new tax will apply to almost all Canadian businesses, because only those with annual sales of less than C$30,000 will be able to choose whether they wish to be in the sales tax system.    The new tax will be levied in addition to provincial sales taxes, in all provinces except Alberta, that range up to 12%. </TEXT></DOC>
