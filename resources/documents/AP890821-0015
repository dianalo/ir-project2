It was perfectly legal thanks to a decade-old law, but even so,Taylor's decision highlights a practice that is drawing criticism asethics questions simmer in Congress.   President Bush has proposed outlawing the practice and the Senatealready has voted to ban it. The debate could shift this fall to theHouse, which has vigorously resisted such proposals because itsmembers are the ones that would be affected and they have millionsof dollars at stake.   ``It amounts to a special interest-financed retirement fund,''complains Susan Manes of Common Cause, a government watchdog groupthat advocates an overhaul of the system for financing congressionalcampaigns.   ``The ethics spotlight has been trained on Congress,'' said Ms.Manes.   Advocates of a change in campaign finance law say lawmakers mayhave to act on the issue soon to salve public concerns over ethicsscandals in Congress such as the one that led to the resignation ofHouse Speaker Jim Wright.   Taylor belongs to an exclusive club of current and former Housemembers permitted under a 10-year-old law to take leftover cash fromtheir re-election treasuries for personal use after they leaveoffice.   According to records of the Federal Election Commission, Taylorhas converted more surplus campaign cash to personal use than anyother former lawmaker. But Taylor bristles at the attention the newsmedia have given his use of campaign donations.   ``I haven't done anything wrong,'' says Taylor. ``I do a lot ofthings out there for public service. I'm going to use some of it forthat.''   The law allows House members in office before Jan. 8, 1980, toconvert excess campaign money to personal use.   Currently, 191 House members are covered by that ``grandfatherclause'' and they had cash reserves of $39 million in theirre-election accounts at the start of the year.   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., had $1.16 million at the end of Juneand Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., had $1.01 million in his campaignaccount.   A Senate rule prohibits current and former members from spendingcampaign money for personal use. But practically speaking, it can'tbe enforced once a senator leaves office. House rules prohibitcurrent members from spending campaign money for personal use.   Any retiring House or Senate member can contribute leftovercampaign money to a political party, other political campaigns,charitable organizations, or transfer the money to a trust orfoundation for educational, scientific or religious purposes.   Some members return the money to contributors. But former membershave transferred at least $862,000 in surplus campaign money topersonal use after leaving office since 1980, according to a reportearlier this year by Congressional Quarterly.   When Taylor left office in January, his campaign committee listeda balance of $457,938. During the first six months of this year, hecontributed $64,200 to churches and colleges in southwest Missouri,gave $2,500 to political candidates and spent about $8,600 on otheritems, including automobile insurance and airline tickets.   At the end of June he transferred $345,000 to himself by writingtwo personal checks. Campaign money converted to personal use issubject to state and federal taxation, and Taylor estimates nearly40 percent of the transfer will go for taxes.   Last month the Senate approved a bill to repeal the loophole.   ``When donors contribute to a political candidate they do so withan understanding that their money will be used to further thecandidate's campaign, not to augment his or her personal wealth,''said Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., the sponsor of the repeallegislation.   President Bush has offered another solution, proposing to barcandidates from carrying over campaign money from one election toanother. A House task force also is studying the issue as it triesto develop an ethics and campaign finance package.</TEXT></DOC>
