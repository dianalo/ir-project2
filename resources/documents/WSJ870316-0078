RundleStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Supposedly uptight, competitive and stressed out, the middle-aged, middle-class executive has long been the stereotypical candidate for heart disease.    But the typical heart-disease victim of the 1990s, several studies suggest, is more apt to be a blue-collar worker or someone on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder -- one who smokes more, exercises less and eats more junk food than his more affluent contemporaries.    &quot;By the end of this decade, it's likely that (low) socioeconomic status may be one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease,&quot; says Kenneth I. Shine, president of the American Heart Association and dean of the medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles. Upper- and middle-class people, he explains, seem to be modifying their diets, quitting smoking and adopting exercise programs in greater numbers than less affluent groups.    Though socioeconomic factors are still a relatively new area of focus, a number of companies have begun making preventive health programs available to more wageearning employees. The American Heart Association and other groups are also considering ways to address the blue-collar audience more effectively with information on cutting the risk of heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer.    The U.S. death rate from heart disease dropped 39% between 1963 and 1984, to 229.2 per 100,000. Dr. Shine notes some studies indicate that middle-class white males have shown greater improvement in cardiovascular fitness than other segments of society. &quot;We used to think this was related to less availability of health-care services (among the other groups), but there are now important clues that this isn't an adequate explanation,&quot; he says.    For example, the poor and uneducated are also more prone to having cancer. But there isn't such a strong correlation between income and death from cancer. &quot;With heart disease, there are dramatic disparities (in death rates) between rich and poor; this is less true for cancer,&quot; says Ralph R. Frerichs, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA. If health care were the only factor, the differences would likely be more similar.    Dr. Frerichs is the principal author of a major 1984 study of cardiovascular disease in Los Angeles County. The study showed poor males -- those with annual incomes below $13,600 -- to be almost 40% more likely to die of heart disease than wealthier males. And income in itself appeared to have a higher correlation than other factors, such as race. Poor black males, for instance, were found to be 53% more likely to die of heart disease than black males above the $28,500-a-year income level.    Another study is that done by Du Pont Co. of its employees over a 26-year period ended in 1983. During that time, the incidence of heart disease declined 37.6% among salaried employees -- but only 18.2% among hourly workers. Both groups had the same company-paid health insurance benefits, so the results wouldn't seem to reflect unequal access to health care, the researchers say. (Health specialists consider the study especially significant because of its duration.)    Smoking habits may be one reason for the disparity. Sidney Pell, a former epidemiologist at Du Pont and the author of the company's study, points out that the rates of heart-disease decline for salaried and hourly employees diverged in the mid-1960s, shortly after the U.S. Surgeon General issued his landmark report on the dangers of smoking. In the wake of the report, Mr. Pell says, salaried workers reduced smoking more than hourly employees.    This isn't just true at Du Pont. The National Cancer Society has found that men with college educations, white-collar occupations and higher incomes are less likely to smoke than are those with only high-school educations, blue-collar jobs and lower incomes.    Health specialists say another possible reason blue-collar workers seem to be lagging in the battle against heart disease is the nature of corporate preventive health programs. Most appear geared more to managers and white-collar employees; many are still little more than executive perks or pilot projects being tested at headquarters. &quot;We're not doing too hot in reaching blue-collar workers -- nobody is,&quot; says Lois G. Michaels, executive director of the Health Education Center, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit affiliate of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania.    The cost of treating heart disease in the U.S. in 1987 will be about $71 billion, not counting an additional $14.2 billion in lost output due to disability, the heart association estimates. Roughly 25% of those expenses will be paid by company-sponsored health plans. With blue-collar workers making up about 30% of the U.S. work force, a growing number of employers are expanding their preventive health programs to reach more hourly employees.    The acceleration has been &quot;almost exponential&quot; over the past two years, says Axel Goetz, vice president of research at General Health Inc., a health-care consulting and services concern in Washington, D.C. &quot;We're seeing strong efforts to improve employee health that involve larger and larger corporate resources.&quot;    As early as 1983, Johnson andamp; Johnson extended its so-called wellness program -- featuring education in such things as weight control, stress management and nutrition -- to all employees after it proved beneficial in the locations where it was first tried. &quot;Changes in absenteeism and health-care costs allow us to break even in the second year&quot; and realize savings thereafter, says Curtis Wilbur, a psychologist who founded the program. Johnson andamp; Johnson recently set up a venture to market it to other companies.    But many union leaders remain skeptical. Sheldon W. Samuels, the AFL-CIO's health director, says workers often dismiss wellness programs as smokescreens that obscure such health threats as toxic chemicals and poor lighting. &quot;We know that heat, ionizing radiation and many solvents are linked with hypertension and heart disease,&quot; he says. For workers exposed to such things, he argues, &quot;a pamphlet in a rack outside the john telling them to get their blood pressure checked&quot; doesn't go over very well. And corporate health screening, which may involve blood-pressure, cholesterol, stress and other tests, is often viewed with suspicion by workers worried that the results could be used in deciding promotions or dismissals.    Moreover, even when fitness programs are made available to blue-collar workers, there may be obstacles. Health specialists note, for example, that time-clock punchers have less flexibility in their hours, and it's hard for hundreds of them to use company exercise facilities during the same lunch break.    But there is evidence of growing labor support for work-site wellness programs that union representatives have helped to design and implement. For example, a five-year study of cardiovascular risk reduction and health promotion that began in 1984 at General Motors Corp. is jointly supported by the company, several federal agencies and the United Auto Workers, considered a trend setter among labor unions in the area of health benefits. Plans call for the study to evaluate the most effective ways of &quot;engaging the reluctant or uninterested employee.&quot;    The heart association, too, is planning a conference in May aimed at examining ways to influence behavior in &quot;hard-to-reach&quot; groups. Participants will include cardiologists, medical researchers, business people and health professionals.    Bernard O'Keefe, chairman of the executive committee of EGandamp;G Inc., a Wellesley, Mass., defense contractor, is also chairman of the association's two-year-old corporate cabinet. He thinks there are lessons to be learned from how cigarette and beer companies pitch their products to blue-collar workers. Typically, this is done through television and print advertising. The media for most health advice, by contrast, are instructional brochures, self-help books and articles in the press.    &quot;Our message has been predominantly oriented towards middle-class people who like to read,&quot; the association's Dr. Shine concluded in a talk to science writers in Los Angeles last summer. &quot;We have to recognize that the message that we've been sending was created to a certain extent by us, for us.&quot;    ---                       Wealth and Health   A study of cardiovascular disease in Los Angeles Countyfrom 1979-81 found a higher death rate among lower-incomemen.
