It will be shown that the specific costsof the transmission and compensation elements as well as those of theelectric energy and power losses have a decisive influence on the achievableoverall saving. After formulating an objective function representingthis overall saving, taking also the load factor into account an analyticalapproach to the determination of the optimal size of the compensationequipment is presented. A generalized chart is given which enables thedesigner to know whether the power factor correction is feasible or notunder any circumstances. Also, the most suitable degree of reactive powercompensation can be directly found. The results obtained from a digitalprogram are also given to indicate the sensitivity of the optimal compensationfactor to changes in system parameters such as the specific energy losscost and the annual rate of interest and depreciation. Moreover, thegood agreement of the results of the digital computation with those determinedusing the suggested simple generalized chart, could be realized.</TEXT></DOC>
