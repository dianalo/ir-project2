A statement released by Arianespace, the commercial arm of the European Space Agency, said repairs on the rocket were completed at the launching site in Kourou, French Guiana.    The repair work between the payload and launcher sections of the rocket involved rewiring an adapter. A new onboard computer was fitted in the vehicle equipment bay and tested, the statement said.    Ariane-4, designed to serve as the space agency's new workhorse, will carry three satellites into orbit -- a European weather satellite and two telecommunications satellites, including one for the American company Pan American Satellite. </TEXT></DOC>
