SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MAUTHAUSEN, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II on Friday condemnedNazism on the site where 110,000 World War II prisoners died, butthe pontiff angered Austria's chief rabbi by not making a specificreference to Jewish victims.   Earlier, John Paul urged Austrian Jewish leaders to accept theVatican's call for a Palestinian homeland. The Roman Catholicleader did not respond to appeals for the Vatican to give fulldiplomatic recognition to Israel.   The pope also said Mass in Trausdorf near the Hungarian borderfor an estimated 80,000 people, most of them Yugoslavs andHungarians.   The emotional high point of the day came at Mauthausen,Austria's most infamous death camp, where an estimated 110,000 Naziprisoners died or were murdered.   On his arrival, six U.S. Jews who were opposed to the pontiff'smeeting Thursday with President Kurt Waldheim scuffled briefly withpolice outside the camp. The group was kept away from the pope, andit was not known if he saw the altercation.   ``They threw me down, they used excessive force,'' Rabbi AviWeiss of Riverdale, N.Y., told The Associated Press.   Earlier in Vienna, police detained Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeldand eight supporters.   Ludwig Soswinski, the head of the camp survivors' group,introduced the pope to 11 camp survivors, including a Polishpriest, Rev. Zdislaw Lipinski.   The Polish-born pontiff, speaking outside a memorial chapel,said: ``Here in Mauthausen were people who, in the name of alunatic ideology, set into motion a whole machinery of contempt andhatred of others.''   Delivering his remarks in German, the pontiff continued: ``Theytortured them, broke their bones, cruelly abused their bodies andtheir souls.''   Camp inmates were forced to work in nearby quarries, carryinghuge granite blocks up 189 steps known as the ``stairway of death.''   The pontiff mentioned Marcel Callo, a Catholic activist who diedin Mauthausen, Polish priest St. Maximilian Kolbe, and two otherCatholics who died in Nazi camps. But the Roman Catholic leadermade no reference specifically to Jews.   That angered Chaim Eisenberg, Austria's chief rabbi, who toldreporters in Vienna: ``A visit to Mauthausen without mentioning theword Jews once is not satisfactory.''   ``The only Jew he mentions who suffered is Jesus Christ, and hedidn't die in Mauthausen,'' Eisenberg said.   During the visit, John Paul stood silently for nearly a minutein front of a plaque written in Hebrew and German in memory of theJewish victims of Mauthausen.   The Vatican, citing Austrian researchers, says that of the44,000 Poles killed in Mauthausen, 7,000 were Jewish, while amajority of the 32,000 Hungarians who lost their lives there wereJewish. Tens of thousands of Soviets and Germans also perished,although the Vatican provided no breakdown on the percentage ofJews.   The pontiff met earlier with Austrian Jewish community PresidentPaul Grosz and five other Jewish leaders in Vienna.   The Klarsfeld group was outside the building voicing itsopposition to the pontiff's meeting with Waldheim, who has facedallegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes.   Mrs. Klarsfeld and seven supporters were released within severalhours, but her son, Arno, was detained for further questioning.During the protest, he had been wearing a Nazi uniform, which isillegal.   ``The Jewish people have the right to a homeland, as any othernation has according to international law,'' John Paul said. ``Thesame goes for the Palestinian people, many of whom have becomehomeless and refugees.''   The pope reminded his audience he had made a similar call inSeptember in Miami.   Grosz appealed to the pope to work with Jewish leaders to ``seeka way to solve the problem of the Middle East together.''   Grosz also said he regretted ``that full diplomatic relationsbetween Israel and the Holy See have not yet been established.''The pontiff did not respond to that point.   The Vatican has cited Israel's lack of settled borders and theinternational dispute over Jerusalem for the absence of diplomaticties with Israel.   Speaking of the Nazi murder of an estimated 6 million Jews, thepope said: ``The incomprehensible pain, suffering and tears stillare before my eyes and etched deep in my soul.''   But he added: ``It would be clearly unjust and untrue to chargeChristianity with these unspeakable crimes.''   Some Jewish leaders have accused Christians and the Vatican inparticular of failing to do enough to prevent the Holocaust.   Many Jews have criticized the pope for meeting with Waldheim atthe start of the five-day trip.   Waldheim has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimesduring his service in the German army. The Austrian president hasdenied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
