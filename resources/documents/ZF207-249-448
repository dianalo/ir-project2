(Software Review) (PrimeSolutions' Disk Technician) (evaluation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>McCormick, John.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Prime Solutions' Disk Technician utility package can help usersrecover from a crashed hard disk.andP;  A disk controller will read asector many times and, if the data stored there is notrecoverable, it will try to reconstruct it using the ErrorCorrection Code.andP;  Disk Technician watches for this kind ofactivity and monitors the sector every time it is accessed.andP;  Ifthe sector problem clears up after a while, the program willignore it.andP;  However, if the problem gets worse, Disk Technicianwill move the data and will mark the sector as bad.andP;  Installationof the program is simple and, although a lot of complexinformation is presented, Disk Technician is easy to run.andO;Unfortunately, Disk Technician will not work with all hard diskcontrollers.andP;  Nonetheless, the program is excellent and well worthusing.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Prime Solutions Inc.

 Who cares?andP;  But you can bet if one crashes in your office youwill hear howling from the lowest to the highest levels.andM;Have you ever had a hard-disk crash?andP;  Would you like to avoid that wonderfulcharacter-building experience, or are you anxious to try to reconstruct 70Mor perhaps 310M of files from musty backups?andM;If you are neither an incurable optimist nor a thoroughgoing masochist,consider buying Disk Technician from Prime Solutions, San Diego, Calif.,andO;before you power up that computer one more time.andM;No possible program or hardware gimmick can guarantee you will never suffer aspun bearing or electronic failure, but the majority of hard-disk problemscome from the magnetic media that actually store the vital information.andM;What normally happens in even a catastrophic disk crash is that some one partof the disk becomes unreadable, perhaps one that contained part of the bootor file allocation tables.andM;You then need to run a program that can make the disk usable withoutresorting to low-level reformatting.andP;  Such reformatting wipes out all dataand takes quite a bit of time.andM;Such disk utilities are better than nothing, because they do tell you morethan DOS, which actually hides its failure to read an individual bit.andM;After the disk controller has failed to correctly read a sector after about30 tries, the Error Correction Code (ECC) is brought into play to reconstructthe missing data.andM;If this succeeds, most disk repair programs never learn from DOS thatanything was wrong.andP;  Only if the data actually is unrecoverable do theyreport and mark a bad sector.andM;SpinRite from Gibson Research, Laguna Hills, Calif., goes one step furtherand watches for this ECC activity.andP;  SpinRite marks the sector bad andperforms a low-level format of just that sector, after saving the data to asafe location.andM;An order of magnitude beyond SpinRite is a program that detects when thecontroller makes even one additional read attempt.andM;Disk Technician will find and remember any sector on a disk that requiresthis extra read and continue to monitor its condition every time it is run.andO;If a sector ceases to have read problems after it is initially formatted,then Disk Technician ignores it except for the more extensive weekly andmonthly runs.andM;If, on the other hand, a sector gets progressively worse, requiring fourretries this week and six the next week, Disk Technician moves the data andmarks the sector bad, long before the ECC enters the picture.andM;Sound complicated?andP;  Well, one of the first test sites for Disk Technician wasa West Coast Army base where the person in charge of testing gave the programto someone he referred to as &quot;lucky to be able to turn off the computer andgo home at night.&quot;andM;Not So ComplicatedandM;This operator was watched through a window and, although he was confused bymuch or all of the technical information displayed, Disk Technician wentright ahead and completed its tests and repairs with no problems.andM;Installation is very simple, but probably should be done by someone with atleast minimal computer experience so the best options can be selected;everything can be completely automatic.andM;One problem with SpinRite is that, while it performs a low-level format justlike Disk Technician, it performs a non-destructive format of the entire diskevery time.andP;  Since this formatting takes a lot of time, SpinRite is notpractical for daily use.andM;The first time you run Disk Technician it will take a long time -- many hoursdepending on the size and speed of your disk as well as its condition -- butafter that it usually takes only a few seconds to check and reformat just thequestionable sectors.andM;SpinRite and Disk Technician also will test and modify your disk's interleavefactor if they determine that it is not properly matched to your computer.andO;This procedure matched to your computer.andP;  This procedure can improvedramatically the data transfer times for some users.andM;The only problem with Disk Technician is that it won't work with somehard-disk controllers; neither will SpinRite.andP;  Because of the way itintercepts information below the BIOS level, it won't work with &quot;translating&quot;controllers, like those in my IBM Model 80.andM;Constant updates to the program broaden the range of controllers it will workwith.andM;The latest version, Version 3, Revision 5.23, tests to see if a controllercan perform low-level formats and if not it disables that option.andP;  It alsoworks with buffered, hard-coded interleave and 1-to-1 interleave controllers.andM;If you are serious enough about your data's integrity to use error correctionsoftware, Disk Technician is the only program sophisticated enough to detectand correct bad sectors before they endanger data.andM;It also is the only one that can warn you when your entire disk is becomingmarginal, by detecting a steady increase in questionable sectors; and the onethat's practical to run daily.andM;After all, if you only run such a program once every few months, you arehardly better off than if you never ran it.andM;Disk Technician Advanced definitely is the utility software of this or anyyear if it can work with your particular controller.andM;A brief aside about Prime Solutions and Disk Technician.andP;  When I first sawthe software I refused to use it because it was heavily copy-protected andthe company wouldn't release any information about how it worked.andP;  All thathas changed now and I am happy to recommend this fine software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
