(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The crew of the nuclear-poweredsubmarine Tennessee successfully launched its third Trident 2missile in 11 days Friday, freeing up $950 million that Congresshad withheld from the program because of early test failures.   The success also put the Navy's newest, deadliest weapon ontrack for operational deployment at sea in March.   ``A nice, safe, easy launch straight down through thecountdown,'' said Vice Adm. Roger F. Bacon, commander of theAtlantic Submarine Fleet, who observed the test 50 miles off theFlorida coast.   Bacon said the launch demonstrated that engineers have overcomenozzle design problems that caused the explosive failure of two ofthe first three undersea tests in March and August.   Because of the failures, Congress froze all but $250 million ofthe $l.2 billion appropriated for the Trident 2 program in fiscalyear 1990. Congress stipulated the funds would be released when theNavy logged three successes of the redesigned missile.   That requirement was met when the third straight success wasregistered Friday, said Lt. Greg Smith, Navy spokesman.   Three more submarine test-firings are planned in January andFebruary before the Tennessee goes on operational patrol with 24 ofthe powerful missiles, each capable of delivering as many as 12nuclear wearheads to individual targets, Bacon said.   Twenty-four Trident 2 submarines are planned.   The two early failures set the program back, missing theoriginal November operational date. March was set as the new targetafter the faulty nozzle system was redesigned.   Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters were not on the scene Fridayas the submerged submarine unleashed the 44-foot, $26.5-millionmissile, which propelled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosedocean target more than 4,000 miles down the Atlantic tracking range.   A large Greenpeace vessel was badly damaged Dec. 4 when a Navyship rammed it to keep it out of the launch safety zone. A smallersailboat kept its distance as the protesters staged a silent vigilduring a launch Wednesday.   Shannon Fagan, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, said the organizationnow would take its fight to Congress in an effort to kill theTrident 2 program.</TEXT></DOC>
