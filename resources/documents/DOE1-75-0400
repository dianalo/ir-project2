Ultimately, transitions were observedin the analagous compounds with Ba replaced with Ca7 and Sr7,8 for 0.1{le} x {le} 0.3 with the highest Tc's above 40K. The author's sampleswere prepared from reagent-grade powders of La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, BaCO{sub3}, SrCO{sub 3}, CaCO{sub 3}, PbO{sub 2}, and CuO. The powders were mixedin inappropriate ratios and calcined in air between 1000 and 1100C for12 hours. The resulting materials were reground, pressed into small disks(nominally 1 cm diameter by 2 mm height) and sintered in air at 1000-1100Cfor 12h. The calcined powders and sintered pellets were x-rayed followingeach process to ensure that the proper phase was present.</TEXT></DOC>
