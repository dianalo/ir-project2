Last week Michael Dukakis made it clear that instead of the Rev. Jackson his other running mate is Richard Gephardt, the St. Louis Congressman who unsuccessfully courted voters in the Democratic primaries by bashing South Korean Hyundais.    Unveiling a new theme of &quot;economic nationalism&quot; last Friday, Mr. Dukakis traveled to an automotive-parts factory near St. Louis with Mr. Gephardt. He then borrowed one of the Congressman's favorite themes, foreigner-bashing.    &quot;Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for foreign owners, and pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to foreign owners,&quot; Mr. Dukakis said. &quot;But that's not the kind of future Lloyd Bentsen and I and Dick Gephardt and you want for America.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis's &quot;future&quot; no doubt confused his listeners at Moog Automotive, since their plant has been owned for 11 years by an Italian company. But what was apparently an advance man's blunder may have been just as well, since it illustrates the futility of the idea that the U.S. can compete by walling itself off from Italians, Japanese or anyone else. (As it happens, Mr. Dukakis also made his attack -- &quot;America is losing businesses and markets to our competitors&quot; -- the same day the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%. Another advance-man mistake, no doubt.)    Mr. Dukakis comes late to these notions. In the primary debates, he attacked Mr. Gephardt. The way to engage the world economy, he said, wasn't by &quot;talking about Hyundais . . . that isn't going to solve our problem.&quot; The way to do it was with &quot;old-fashioned American ingenuity to go out there and sell and make good products, and compete around the world.&quot;    Now, however, ingenuity and competition have given way to xenophobia. &quot;Dan Quayle's happy to hang a 'For Sale' sign on America,&quot; Mr. Dukakis said on Friday, though all Mr. Quayle had said is that perhaps it's not a bad thing that foreigners want to invest in America to create jobs. Mr. Quayle might have added that foreigners own only about 5% of U.S. assets, hardly a sign of &quot;buying up America.&quot; But he did point out that foreign investment is now helping to reverse the trade deficit that so worries Mr. Dukakis. For example, he noted, the U.S. now exports Hondas to Japan.    An erstwhile free-trader, Mr. Dukakis now appears to be a born-again protectionist. &quot;When essential American industries are battered by foreign competition, we may have to provide import relief,&quot; so long as they &quot;become more competitive,&quot; he says. Whatever that may mean. Lloyd Bentsen has of course already indicated what he thinks it means by supporting more protection for the textile lobby. That &quot;essential&quot; U.S. industry already has had 30 years of trade barriers to &quot;become more competitive.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis also distributed a policy statement that said he'll insist on strict trade &quot;reciprocity.&quot; So if the Korean government makes its citizens pay $5 for a banana, Mr. Dukakis apparently thinks Americans should pay some equally outrageous price for an imported item. He also implied he favors frequent trade retaliation: &quot;Mike Dukakis will use the full powers of the presidency to restore America's pre-eminence in world trade.&quot; But surely even the governor of a mid-sized state must understand that this is a recipe for a trade war.    Mr. Dukakis's aides say this transformation is part of a new &quot;populist&quot; message. No doubt there are voters who will respond to this sort of jingoism, but we suspect a majority will understand that they as consumers will pay in the end. The voters rejected Mr. Gephardt once before. And even in the South Carolina primary, in the heart of textile country, they repudiated the two most protectionist Republicans, Bob Dole and Pat Robertson.    Mr. Bush was the big winner in South Carolina, and Mr. Dukakis is now giving him another opportunity. Mr. Bush has said he wants to expand world trade, and he favors reducing trade barriers both through the Uruguay round of GATT talks and bilateral agreements such as the Canada-U.S. free-trade pact.    He will not help himself now by following Mr. Dukakis in appeasing special interests, as he has with the rice lobby. His opportunity lies in a more authentic populism that defends consumers and the free market against the special interests, and advocates competing with the world instead of running from it. We have never regarded this campaign as &quot;issueless,&quot; and certainly this is one issue the voters will understand. </TEXT></DOC>
