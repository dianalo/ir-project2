North's renewedattempts to obtain secret documents concerning other covertoperations he participated in or that came to his attention.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh claimed in court papersthat North's latest request shows he wants ``to embark on a fishingexpedition into the nation's most sensitive classified materials.''   He accused North of trying to ``convert the discovery rules intoa vehicle for rummaging through files that are irrelevant to thecharges in the indictment, thereby delaying the trial of thismatter.''   North is awaiting trial on charges he conspired with PresidentReagan's former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter, andtwo arms dealers to divert U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to theNicaraguan rebels.   His lawyers recently asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesellto reconsider his refusal to force the government to produceclassified documents about other covert operations that he knewabout or participated in while a National Security Council aide.   North is requesting documents about covert operations that used``commercial cutouts, foreign bank accounts, or other methods ortechniques similar to those allegedly used in connection with theIranian initiative or in connection with the support for theNicaraguan resistance.''   Material sought includes documents about covert operationsundertaken ``without an express, written presidential finding''authorizing the activity.   Walsh contended that none of the materials is relevant to anydefense North might offer that he acted with authority of highergovernment officials.   No date has been set for North's trial.   Gesell has also ordered separate trials for Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord.</TEXT></DOC>
