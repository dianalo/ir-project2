Donald Gene Burleson, 39, faces a charge of ``harmful access toa computer,'' and is free on a $3,000 bond pending his July 11trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.   An indictment accuses him of executing programs ``designed tointerfere with the normal use of the computer'' and of acts ``thatresulted in records being deleted.''   Police described the electronic interference as a ``massivedeletion'' of more than 168,000 records of sales commissions foremployees.   Burleson is thought to be the first person charged under thestate law that took effect Sept. 1, 1985, and prohibits computersabotage, said Davis McCown, chief of the Tarrant County districtattorney's economic crimes division.   Three weeks after the law went into effect, USPA and IRA Co., aFort Worth-based national securities and brokerage concern, noticeda problem with its computer system, investigators said.   An investigation revealed that an intruder had used a ``backdoorpassword'' at night to gain access to the computer and covered histracks by erasing computer logs that would have documented hisactivity.   Burleson, a computer security officer who had been fired twodays before the infection, was one of only a few of the 200 workersin the home office to have the access and knowledge needed tosabotage the system, officials said. A computer ``virus'' is aprogram that can severely damage a system's regular software.Viruses can be transmitted among systems through contaminatedsoftware or from programs picked up from electronic bulletin boards.   ``You can see it, but you can't see what it does _ just like ahuman virus,'' said McCown. ``It had the ability to multiply andmove around and was designed to change its name so it wouldn't bedetected.''   McCown, quoted in Monday's Dallas Morning News, said he wants tomake sure ``that this type of criminal understands that we have theability to make these type of cases; that it's not so sophisticatedor complicated that it's above the law.''   USPA already has been awarded $12,000 by a jury in a civillawsuit filed against Burleson.</TEXT></DOC>
