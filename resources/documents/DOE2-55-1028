<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1028 </DOCNO><TEXT>The validity of the quasiparticle random-phase approximation is studiedby comparing it with full shell-model calculations in the sd-shell. Phenomenologicalinteractions relevant for the sd-shell have been applied, and Gamow-Teller{beta}/sup +/ strengths are calculated. It is found that in the QRPA,the {beta}/sup +/ strength is a factor of two higher than the shell-modelresult. The shell-model results are less sensitive to the particle-particleinteraction strength than the QRPA. With u, v factors from the shell-modelwave functions, the {beta}/sup +/ strength in the QRPA reproduces theshell-model result. This suggests that the QRPA does not contain enoughground-state correlations.</TEXT></DOC>
