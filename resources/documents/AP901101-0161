It was the second such major exercise for the U.S. Navy andMarine Corps deployed to the region as part of the mass land, airand sea buildup following Iraq's invasion three months ago.   The first, in which the amphibious warship USS Iwo Jima tookpart, had been ``successfully accomplished,'' said Lt. KevinWensing, a spokesman for Command Naval Forces, Central Command.   Elsewhere Thursday, colleagues stopped to mourn 10 of thecrewmen of the Iwo Jima killed in a boiler-room accident offBahrain.   The Iwo Jima accident occurred Tuesday as the warship ended arest and recreation spell at Bahrain's Mina Sulman port and washeading out to participate in the assault exercises starting thatsame day.   Wensing said elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade,and Amphibious Task Group 2, were conducting the amphibioustraining exercise in the north Arabian Sea from Oct. 30 to Nov. 8.   The exercise, he said, involved ``surface and heliborneoperations on a remote beachhead'' in which 20 fixed-wing aircraftand 75 helicopters were being employed.   ``The purpose is to continue Navy and Marine Corps training inamphibious landing skills and to familiarize these forces with thedesert environment,'' he said.   Exact location was not given for security reasons, he said. Butit is known the first exercise took place somewhere off Oman.   Wensing, noting there were 18-20 amphibious assault ships in theregion, declined further detail on the marine exercise but stressedthe accident was not in any way affecting the Amphibious TaskForce.   The Iwo Jima is one of Amphibious Task Force ships assigned toassist Operation Desert Shield, preparing to storm Kuwait from seaif the military option is decided to try to end Saddam Hussein'soccupation.   There are 46,000 Marine Corps personnel deployed in the taskforce, with 11,000 aboard the ships and the rest in Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
