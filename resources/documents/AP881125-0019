The finding confirms the life-saving potential of zidovudine,which is sold under the brand name Retrovir, said a Duke Universityphysician independent of the study group.   Researchers enrolled 4,805 patients who had suffered frompneumonia, common in people with AIDS, and treated them withzidovudine, the only AIDS-fighting medication approved by thefederal government.   Seventy-three percent of the subjects were still alive about 10months after treatment started, the researchers reported in today'sJournal of the American Medical Association.   No direct comparison figures are available for people who didn'ttake the drug, since withholding it for study purposes is unethical,said Terri Creagh-Kirk, an epidemiologist at Burroughs-Wellcome Co.,the North Carolina company that makes zidovudine.   But records of people who were diagnosed with AIDS beforezidovudine became available show only 50 percent survived past 11months, she said.   Zidovudine, taken in capsule form, inhibits growth of the virusthat causes AIDS, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.   It is considered the mainstay of treatment for adults withacquired immune deficiency syndrome, but does not cure the disease.   The study was designed by the National Cancer Institute, the Foodand Drug Administration and the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.   The study provides ``important confirmatory evidence'' supportingthe zidovudine's effectiveness in patients with AIDS and a milderform of the disease called AIDS-related complex, Dr. John A.Bartlett of Duke said in an editorial accompanying the study.   ``Contrary to earlier predictions of the limited lifetime ofzidovudine, its future appears bright'' because of the scarcity ofother medications that can fight the AIDS virus, Bartlett wrote.   Subjects had to take the drug every four hours in doses startingat 200 milligrams. Doses were reduced for those reporting sideeffects, including anemia.   The study, started in October 1986, included about 1,000 membersof racial minorities, close to 150 women and 300 intravenous drugusers, as well as homosexual and bisexual men, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.   Previous studies had focused mostly on homosexual and bisexualmen, because they represent the largest proportion of AIDSsufferers, she said.   Subjects were recommended by their physicians, who recorded dataon their conditions during the study period and reported it to acoordinating center in Beltsville, Md.   Enrollment of new patients continued until March 1987, when thedrug received FDA approval.   Of the 4,805 subjects, 2,838 were reported still alive during thelast 10 weeks of checkups, through Sept. 15, 1987, the researcherssaid.   ``It is likely that many other patients were still alive on Sept.15, 1987, although no information concerning them has been receivedsince June 30, 1987,'' they wrote.   During the study, 847 patients were reported to have died, butMs. Creagh-Kirk said some doctors failed to provide regular updateson their patients, and more deaths may have occurred without theresearchers' knowledge.   Their calculation of a 73 percent survival rate takes intoaccount such limitations, she said.   Other limitations noted by Bartlett included lack of confirmationof physicians' observations; possible bias in the way doctorsselected patients; and absence of supervision in reporting of data.</TEXT></DOC>
