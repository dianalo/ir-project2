The company, a Houston-based oil and gas exploration and production concern, said a recently established rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board will allow Pogo and other companies to reduce the amount of deferred income taxes to reflect lower top corporate tax rates.    The company declined to elaborate on its fourth-quarter results.    The company also said it settled natural gas contract disputes with two pipeline companies, Southern Natural Gas Co. and Sea Robin Pipeline Co. Pogo received $4 million from the settlements.    Officials at Southern Natural and Sea Robin couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
