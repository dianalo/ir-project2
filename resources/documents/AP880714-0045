Doe saidWednesday that his security forces quashed a coup attempt led byhis former second-in-command, church-owned Radio Elwa reported.   In a nationwide broadcast Wednesday night, Doe said his forcesexchanged gunfire ``with what is believed to have been an invadingforce'' at one of Liberia's border posts in northern Nimba county,the radio staton said.   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, quoted Doe as saying thealleged force was led by J. Nicholas Podier Jr., described as vicehead-of-state of the former ruling People's Redemption Council.   Doe was quoted as saying the attackers suffered some casualties,but he did not specify how many or whether Podier was among them.   Podier was one of 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officersled by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of the West Africannation in an April 12, 1980 coup. They stormed the executivemansion in Monrovia and assassinated President William R. Tolbert.   After the coup, Doe and his confederates set up the People'sRedemption Council, which ruled by decree until 1985 electionsreturned Liberia to civilian rule with Doe as president.   Podier fell from power in 1982 after being accused of plottingagainst Doe.   Radio Elwa quoted Doe, 36, as saying 12 people were involved inthe alleged invasion, but did not specify where in Nimba County,350 miles north of the capital Monrovia, the incident occurred.Nimba County shares borders with Guinea to the west and the IvoryCoast to the east.   The president assured ``all Liberians and foreigners alike''that his government was in ``complete control of the situation andthere is no need to panic,'' the radio said.   On March 22, police arrested 12 people connected with an allegedplot to assassinate Doe and overthrow his government.</TEXT></DOC>
