Also Wednesday, a military official denied the BritishBroadcasting Corp. was named as the foreign media group thatreportedly paid New People's Army rebels to stage an ambush inFebruary in which a general's son and 10 other soldiers were killed.   The correspondents' group urged President Corazon Aquino'sgovernment to investigate the matter and make the results publicquickly.   ``We fear that such unsubstantiated charges may constitute apotential assault on freedom of the press. We believe that coverageof both sides of a guerrilla conflict is essential to responsiblejournalism,'' the group said in a statement.   Col. Marino Filart, deputy constabulary commander of Bicol wherethe ambush occurred, presented a captured rebel Wednesday who said``Caucasian'' journalists gave her group a wad of 100-peso ($5)bills and three M-16 Armalite rifles to stage the ambush forfilming purposes.   Filart said the woman did not identify the journalists involved.He added that Manila reporters may have concluded that it was theBBC because of a letter with the company's letterhead seized by themilitary from the rebels.   Filart said the letter, signed by a certain Mina Daum, requestedvideo coverage of rebels training but he added that ``we are notsure if the intent of the letter was pushed through.''   His superior, Brig. Gen. Eduardo Taduran, was quoted by Manilanewspapers Monday as saying that the letter showed the BBC was thegroup involved. The military has provided no further evidence tosubstantiate the charges.   The BBC has denied the allegation and said it had no crew in thePhilippines when the ambush occurred.   Rep. Gregorio Andolana urged the Philippine House ofRepresentatives Wednesday to enact measures that would protectjournalists' right to cover events related to the insurgency, thegovernment-run news agency reported.   Andolana, a former human rights lawyer, also asked hiscolleagues to stop the military from carrying out surveillance ofjournalists who maintain contact with rebel sources for their work,the Philippine News Agency said.   On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of the CapitalRegional Command, said the military had seized rebel documents withthe names of 112 foreign and Philippine journalists who had been intouch with the guerillas since 1987.   Aguirre said no legal action would be taken against thereporters but some would be placed under surveillance.   He did not release any names of the reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
