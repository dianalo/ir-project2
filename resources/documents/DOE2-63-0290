Our first prototypeallows detection of /sup 32/P emitters on a 26x26 cm/sup 2/ surface with1.5 mm and 5 mm resolutions, respectively for X and Y directions, anda 0.3% efficiency. Improvements, presently under study, in both fiberqualities and photocathode efficiency should increase the device efficiencyto 40% and its resolution up to the optical fiber diameter (500 {mu}mfor the time being). Such characteristics would allow SOFI to replaceautoradiographic films in biology and make it a convenient position sensitivedetector in nuclear and particle physics.</TEXT></DOC>
