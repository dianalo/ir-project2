Wearing a beige trenchcoat, Chhinder Pal was escorted to aboarding gate at a Montreal airport after an appeals court ruled hecould not stay here while his lawyers appeal his deportation order.   The three-judge panel said Pal did not face ``irreparabledamage'' if returned to his native India.   Pal said he was a Sikh. Violence arising from a Sikh separatistmovement has left thousands dead in northern India.   ``We don't know if (Pal) was in trouble with his government forhis political opinions or for activities that by our standards areillegal or revolutionary activities,'' said Judge Mark MacGuigan.   Controversial amendments to the Immigration Act were announcedlast month by Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall. They are aimedat stemming the tide of bogus refugees into Canada and clearing up abacklog of 85,000 refugee claimants over the next two years.   Pal arrived on Jan. 1, the day the new immigration policies wentinto effect. He appeared before an immigration panel on Jan. 6claiming his life would be in danger if he were sent back to India.   His lawyer, Melvin Weigel, argued that Pal did not have a lawyerpresent when he gave a statement to immigration officials onarriving in Canada. That statement was later used against Pal at hishearing.   Under the new immigration system, two-member federal panelsevaluate a claimant's story and determine whether he faces danger inthe country he has left.   If both panel members agree a claimant is a bogus refugee, theycan order the person deported within 72 hours.   In Ottawa, the London-based human rights organization AmnestyInternational released a statement saying Pal should have passed thefirst refugee test and been allowed to stay in Canada while hisclaim was being processed.   ``(Pal) faces the risk of persecution of the basis of hispolitical activities if he is deported to India,'' said lawyerMichael Schelew, head of the refugee committee of Amnesty'sEnglish-Canadian section.</TEXT></DOC>
