Ed Jenkins told the soon-to-bepresidential nominee, cautioning that the lawmakers wereperfectly willing to abandon the candidate if need be to runtheir own races.   Next year's presidential candidate won't even need thewarning. Going into the 1992 campaign, congressionalDemocrats' every-man-for-himself attitude has become soentrenched it will complicate the uphill task of anyDemocratic presidential nominee.</LP><TEXT>   Many lawmakers themselves recognize the problems they arecreating, but seem helpless to do anything about it. &quot;We'renot laying a good foundation for a presidential candidate,&quot;says Democratic Rep. David Nagle, a former chairman of Iowa'sDemocratic Party. &quot;That would require us to use much morediscipline on ourselves than we're willing to do.&quot;   &quot;The Democrats are not doing their job,&quot; says NeilNewhouse of Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican pollingfirm. &quot;It's just amazing. More Democrats than ever arelooking at self-preservation.&quot;   The problem stems from divided government. WithRepublicans dominating the White House and Democrats theCongress in recent decades, Democrats have fallen into thehabit of getting themselves re-elected without the benefit ofa broader party message, relying instead on whatever worksfor them in their individual races.   That contrasts sharply with congressional Republicans'strategy when the Democrats controlled the White House in theCarter administration. Because they were in the minority inCongress, GOP lawmakers had no governing responsibility. Andthey used that freedom from responsibility to lay out anagenda -- the Kemp-Roth tax cuts, a defense buildup,deregulation -- that set the stage for the party to recapturethe White House in 1980.   For Democrats, though, their continual dominance ofCongress has created an additional problem: the growth of aninstitutionalized system that basically gives each and everyone of them a platform. There are 323 Democrats currently inthe House and Senate, and by recent count there are 307committees, subcommittees, select committees and specialcommittees for them to head -- nearly one for every member.   The result is unrelenting independence. &quot;Every senator andcongressman has his own operation,&quot; says Democratic Sen. KentConrad of North Dakota. &quot;There's very little we're beholdento the party for.&quot;   In fact, though congressional Democrats would surely denyit in public, it's far from certain that many of them reallywant a Democrat to win the White House this time. Many of theparty's most prominent congressional lights, including SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, Sen. Albert GoreJr. of Tennessee and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardtof Missouri, have all bypassed the 1992 contest in theexpectation that 1996 might provide a better opportunity. Ifa Democrat wins next year, their shot would probably have tobe postponed until at least the year 2000.   Moreover, Democrats remember that the last time they heldthe White House, the result was the 1980 debacle that costthem control of the Senate -- the only time they have beenout of power in either chamber in almost 40 years.   The party's current problems are most visible in itsinability to score political points with issues that wouldseem tailor-made for it. &quot;Tax fairness&quot; is a prime example.Some Democrats, notably Sen. Gore and New York Rep. ThomasDowney, have proposed a plan to sharply raise taxes onupper-income taxpayers to pay for reductions for the middleclass. But that proposal has been undermined by support amongsome rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers for a cut incapital-gains taxes, which would benefit mostly the rich.   The waters have been further muddied by the lukewarmresponse of one of the congressional party's most powerfulbarons, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ofIllinois, who says he will come out with his own, more modestplan later this year. And even the party leaders who backmiddle-class tax cuts, especially House Speaker Thomas Foleyof Washington, weakened their position on tax fairness byalso pushing, though without success, an increase in gasolinetaxes that would have fallen disproportionately onlower-income taxpayers.   These days, Democratic lawmakers can't even seem todemagogue effectively -- failing, for instance, to provide aunited front against GOP efforts to undo the new tax onluxury items passed as part of last year's budget deal.   The tax was one of the Democrats' proudestaccomplishments, as part of their effort to increase the taxburden on the wealthy. But the No. 3 House Democrat, MajorityWhip David Bonior, now supports a partial repeal of the newlevy. The reason: His district in Michigan has moreregistered boats than any other in the nation.   Some analysts suggest that the Democrats' discord willultimately threaten the very thing they are trying so hard toprotect: their congressional majorities. Partly because ofthe Democrats' drift, Congress has suffered in the publicmind, which has fueled term-limitation drives and led to anincreasing throw-the-bums-out attitude. And even ifincumbents keep getting reelected, there's no guaranteevoters will be willing to elect more &quot;empty vessel&quot; Democratsto replace them once they pass from the scene.   Losing its congressional hegemony, in fact, could be thebest thing to happen to the party, some observers suggest; itmight shake Democrats out of their torpor and free them toredefine themselves around compelling messages.   &quot;What they really need,&quot; says University of Wisconsinpolitical scientist Charles Jones, &quot;is a good defeat.&quot; Heargues that congressional Democrats currently &quot;are notwilling to take the risks that are necessary for theDemocrats nationally to win the presidency.&quot; Losing theirCapitol Hill majorities might &quot;provide the incentive theylack right now to join forces with the presidential wing ofthe party.&quot;   That view is little shared by the congressional party'sleaders, who insist they are doing their best to reduce theDemocratic cacophony. A group of stalwarts in the Houseregularly meet over coffee to plan a message-of-the-day,which they convey in one-minute speeches on the House floor,and also on radio addresses. House and Senate leaders alsohold joint news conferences to lay out their version of anagenda for the party.   But even party leaders often express frustration with thesituation. &quot;Many times I've wished I could simply impose mywill, and do what I want done without the need to consult andexplain,&quot; says Senate Majority Leader Mitchell. Instead, hesays, he now has &quot;the best-developed patience muscle inAmerica.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
