While oil demand continues to grow despite the recessionof the last four years, the recent drop in oil prices -- and thereforein export revenues -- is limiting the country's capacity to invest innew exploration. At the same time, the country's need to generate foreignexchange to pay its debt service may force an escalation in oil exports.A conflict is emerging between Mexico's need to satisfy the domesticdemand for oil and its need to export oil to service the debt. In thiscontext, an oil conservation policy appears to be the only viable alternative,although its potential will be limited by lack of capital. The sectoralanalysis presented in this report identifies unexplored opportunitiesfor energy conservation and points to the forces that will drive futurepatterns of demand. 18 refs., 1 fig., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
