ManuelAntonio Noriega's rule.   And administration officials are hoping to accelerate theprocess at two major international parlays over the next month andin other diplomatic encounters as well.   At his news conference Friday, President Bush said he wasdelighted by signs that Noriega has so little support elsewhere inthe hemisphere.   Panama's membership in an eight-country hemispheric consultativebody has been suspended, and when the seven active members met thispast week in Peru, Noriega's government was roundly criticized.   Still, there appears to be litte sentiment in the hemisphere forU.S. military action against Noriega. In contrast to many membersof Congress, no hemispheric leader criticized Bush for notproviding Panama's rebel leaders with more military support on theday of the coup attempt.   Noriega seems to believe that diplomatic isolation counts forlittle as long as he retains the support of Panama's DefenseForces, but U.S. officials say the country's outcast role willfurther erode his already questionable support within the militaryestablishment.   The officials say all but two democratic countries in thehemisphere _ Mexico and Ecuador _ have withdrawn their ambassadorsfrom Panama City.   ``Those two embassies barely have contact with the Panamaniangovernment,'' one official said Friday, asking not to be identified.   He said the most active embassies in Panama City appear to bethose of Cuba, Nicaragua and Libya.   The Panama question is likely to be a major topic this week whenSpanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez comes to Washington fortalks with Bush.   Saying the time has come for Noriega to retire, Gonzalez lastweek called for new elections followed by the appointment of a newmilitary commander by the elected president.   As an inducement for Noriega to go along with Gonzalez's plan,he would be allowed to retire in Panama, thus evading possibleextradition to the United States, where he faces drug smugglingcharges. So long as he remains in Panama, he cannot be extradited.   The administration will give Gonzalez a hearing on his plan andalso hopes to press its case against Noriega at a summit meeting ofhemispheric democratic heads of government set for Oct. 27-28 inCosta Rica.   Bush and about 17 other heads of government are planning toattend, but administration officials say it would be a mistake toraise expectations that the summit will lead to dramatic actionagainst Noriega.   Among Spanish speaking countries, the only presidents notinvited are from Cuba, Chile and Panama, none of which has anelected government.   Yet another opportunity for the administration to pressureNoriega will occur in mid-November when foreign ministers of the31-nation Organization of American States meet in Washington.   The OAS held four special sessions on Panama between May andAugust, but a team of OAS mediators was unable to fulfill itsmandate of achieving a democratic transfer of power in Panama.   The mediation effort was suspended several weeks ago, but arevival of that initiative remains an option.   Bush has not ruled out military force against Noriega,suggesting Friday he would be willing to consider such a move solong as it could be done with ``prudence.''   But for the short term at least the administration appearsresigned to relying on other ways of bringing down the Panamanianleader - all tedious and undramatic but relatively uncontroversial.   Besides diplomatic pressure, the administration has had in placefor some time a series of economic sanctions against Panama.Officials say a tightening of these measures has been underconsideration since well before the failed coup attempt of Oct. 3.   One possibility is the withholding from the Panamaniangovernment of about $1.5 million in taxes U.S. government agenciespay monthly on behalf of their Panamanian employees.</TEXT></DOC>
