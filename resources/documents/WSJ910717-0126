Klein</HL><DATE>07/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7</SO><LP>   Around Christmas 1965, some Major League baseballveterans, concerned about the game's pension plan, determinedthat the association that had been representing them in adesultory manner should be beefed up by the hiring of afull-time executive director. To that end, they arranged aninterview with Marvin Miller, a well-regarded bargainer forthe United Steelworkers of America.   At the outset of his new book, &quot;A Whole Different BallGame: The Sport and Business of Baseball&quot; (Birch Lane Press,430 pages, $21.95), Mr. Miller relates that at the meetingthe players informed him that if he were hired they had inmind someone to assist him as general counsel: Richard M.Nixon.</LP><TEXT>   With such a mind-set, it was remarkable that the playerswould offer the job to a hard-core unionist like Mr. Miller.And, given that glimpse into the baseball psyche, it's moreremarkable that he took it (without, as it turned out,committing himself to accepting the aid and comfort of Mr.Nixon).   Most remarkable, though, was the association's recordduring the Brooklyn-born economist's 17 years as its leader,ending in 1983. During his tenure, impartial arbitration wassubstituted for owner-imposed settlements of grievances, the&quot;reserve clause&quot; that bound a player to his team at theteam's pleasure was ruled invalid, and the player salaryaverage began its rocketlike ascent from $19,000 to today'snearly $900,000. It's certainly a whole different ball game,in ways that still are evolving.   Mr. Miller's book, written with the help of Allen Barra,details the struggles that led to those gains, and these wereremarkable, too. To say the owners had things their own waybefore he came along would be an understatement. The lords ofthe baseball were (and still are) exempt from the nation'santitrust laws, never gave the players copies of many of thedocuments that bound them, and, when they felt changes werein order, simply had their appointed commissioner announcethem unilaterally. A player running afoul of the game'spowers-that-be was in the same situation as a strangerarrested in &quot;one of those tiny towns where the sheriff alsoturns out to be the judge and the mayor,&quot; Mr. Miller writes.   Moreover, as he notes in several contexts, some of the menhe represented were ignorant of or hostile to the role ofunions in protecting workers' interests, and many wereapathetic over issues they perceived as not directlyinvolving them. For instance, no player showed up in court togive moral support to Curt Flood in his 1970 legal assault onthe reserve clause, or to hear arguments in the owner's(unsuccessful) suit to overturn the five-years-laterarbitrator's ruling that killed the infamous rule and allowedthe players to flex their market muscle.   But he goes on to say that years of labor strife inbaseball, including the strike of 1972 and the lockout of1976, paid off in player solidarity during the 50-day, 1981walkout over the owners' bid for &quot;warmbody&quot; compensation forlost free agents. Given the fact that most players neverperform long enough to attain free agency, Mr. Miller callsthe '81 strike the &quot;most-principled&quot; he'd been associatedwith in a 40-plus-year labor career.   Mr. Miller opines that his union did have allies, but notones you'd expect. Team owners, he says, always could becounted upon to do or say things that would stiffen members'backbones at crucial times.   He continues that the players' best friend -- next tohimself, of course -- was Bowie Kuhn, baseball's commissionerfor most of his time with the players' group. Mr. Miller'slow regard for and asserted gratitude to the starchy Mr. Kuhnpunctuates his book. &quot;If Bowie Kuhn had never existed,&quot; hesummarizes, paraphrasing Voltaire on God, &quot;we would have hadto invent him.&quot;   That view is payback for Mr. Kuhn's assessment of Mr.Miller in his 1987 book, &quot;Hardball,&quot; in which he called theunion chief &quot;sly,&quot; a &quot;mean-spirited badger,&quot; and -- insult ofinsults -- &quot;not a fan.&quot; Marvin, however, one-ups Bowie bymaking him seem pathetic as well as inept. I mean, where elsein the annals of labor relations has a management rep (Kuhn)been depicted as approaching a union negotiator (Miller)before contract talks and asking for leniency because &quot;theowners need a victory&quot;?   Such lack of sportsmanship is only one bone I have to pickwith this book. Mr. Miller repeatedly lumps news people asthe owners' lackeys when my own observation was that hisunion's positions received a fair airing from much of thepress. And he spends much space defending his credentials asa baseball fan instead of merely noting that they wereirrelevant to the job he was hired to perform.   It's clear, though, that the players did better than theyknew when they hired Mr. Miller, and his story is well worthour attention. He brought to a very public enterprise thesort of honestly adversarial relationship between labor andmanagement that we hold up as desirable, and that benefits usall.</TEXT></DOC>
