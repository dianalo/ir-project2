Greenpeace said such cartons should be required for the nearly 5billion half-pints of milk that five of the department's programshelp pay for every year. Eighty percent of that milk is used inschool lunches.   No studies of dioxin in U.S. milk have been reported by anygovernment agency. Greenpeace relied on a Canadian government studyin its petition to the Agriculture Department.   The group said the department should require cartons ofunbleached paper, returnable glass containers or any otherbiodegradable carton that won't put toxic substances in the milk.   Paper milk cartons currently are made with bleached paper. Paperbleached with chlorine can contain trace amounts of dioxin, the mostpowerful cause of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, andrelated compounds, according to industry and government findingsannounced two years ago.   Dioxin has never been proved to cause human cancer, but in highdoses it can cause a severe form of acne and recent evidence haslinked it to reproductive disorders.   The Canadian study and Greenpeace calculations said that a110-pound child drinking a single half-pint from a bleached papercarton would ingest 0.6 picograms of the equivalent of the mosttoxic dioxin per kilogram of body weight.   This is 100 times the daily amount that the EnvironmentalProtection Agency has estimated is likely to raise the risk ofcancer by one in a million if continued for a lifetime. EPA hasproposed a 17-fold reduction in its risk estimates for dioxin, buthas not acted. If the proposed risk estimate were in effect, the 0.6picograms per kilogram would still represent six times the amountestimated to raise the risk of cancer by one in a million.   According to the Canadian study, milk from plastic and glasscontainers contained only a tenth as many dioxin compounds typicalof the bleaching process, or none at all.   All humans in the United States are believed to have traceamounts of dioxin in their fat. The compound binds to fatty tissue.   Janet Hieber of Greenpeace told a news conference the affinity ofdioxin for fat helps account for finding it in milk. ``If the cartonwere filled with water instead of milk, chances are the dioxin wouldhave stayed in the carton,'' she said.   Although no studies of dioxin in U.S. milk have been reported byany government agency, a Washington television station, WJLA,conducted its own tests and found levels similar to those found inCanada, according to Roberta Baskin, a reporter for WJLA at the newsconference.   The Agriculture Department did not immediately return a telephonecall.   Carol Raulston, vice president for government affairs of theAmerican Paper Institute, the industry's major trade association,said ``there were questions about the testing procedure in Canada,and neither their government nor ours is relying on those results.''   The Food and Drug Administration and the industry have begun milktests using a more sophisticated procedure and results are expectedin a few months, she said, and the Agriculture Department shouldwait for those results.   ``The industry is committed to providing safe packaging and ifthere's anything they're uncomfortable with (at FDA), we'll have toaddress that,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
