The pay reductions _ made under work rules the troubled airlinesays it can impose during a strike _ were disclosed as Easterncontinued trying to expand its active routes and otherwise reboundfrom the 10-day-old, crippling walkout by Machinists, pilots andflight attendants.   ``This package would make Eastern the lowest-paid in the industry(compared with major carriers),'' said Wally Haber, a generalchairman for the Machinists union. ``I think it's obvious they don'twant anybody to come back to work.''   Under the new pay rules, Eastern would cut mechanics' pay fromthe current $18.83 to $14 an hour, with new hires receiving aminimum $10 an hour. Baggage handlers would go from $15.60 to$11.54, with new hires receiving $10, and pay for Machinistsjanitors would drop from $13.21 an hour to $8.25, with new hiresgetting a minimum $5, Haber said.   Overtime, holiday and night differential pay are also slashed,Haber said.   Eastern, which filed for federal bankruptcy protection fromcreditors last Thursday, had sought $150 million in concessions fromthe Machinists before the strike to stem a continuing tide offinancial losses. The Machinists walked off the job after 17 monthsof fruitless negotiations.   Haber said pay under the new rules is lower than the company'sfinal contract offer and therefore illegal. He said the Machinistsinternational organization in Washington had been asked to reviewthe work rules to determine if the union would challenge the cuts.   ``I'm sure that if they have a complaint, they'll have a lawyeraddress it,'' said Eastern spokesman James Ashlock. ``This is theway we intend to function in those job categories.''   Haber said the package would make Eastern's pay scales lower thanContinental Airlines, already among the industry's lowest. Bothcarriers are owned by Texas Air Corp.   In other developments Monday:   _Eastern appealed a U.S. District Court ruling rejecting thecompany's claim that its pilots' walkout in sympathy with theMachinists constituted an illegal strike.   _Air Line Pilots Association executives met in Washington todiscuss strike benefits for Eastern members. ALPA's leadership alsowas expected to discuss actions pilots at other airlines could taketo support strikers.   _A temporary injunction that prevented employees of otherairlines from honoring Machinists' secondary picket lines expired atmidnight Monday, the union said. Five airlines _ Northwest, United,USAir, Piedmont and TWA _ sought an extension of the order by U.S.District Judge John Pratt in Washington, D.C.   _Eastern said it was aiming for at least 85 flights a day as itresumed jetliner service between Miami and New York's La GuardiaAirport, Montreal and San Juan, Puerto Rico.   However, the pilots union estimated that by Sunday the airlinewas flying only 3.5 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040daily flights. The union estimates Eastern has fewer than 200pilots, of 3,600 before the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
