This election, like the past two, finds the Democratic candidateaccusing his Republican rival of harboring malevolent intentionstoward the program that 38 million retirees, disabled workers andtheir dependents rely on.   The Social Security issue was of scant help to Jimmy Carter andWalter Mondale against Ronald Reagan, but Michael Dukakis is hopingthat this fall it will give voters pause about backing George Bush.   The $210 billion retirement and disability program, on the vergeof bankruptcy five short years ago, now is piling up hugesurpluses. Its trust funds which grew to $69 billion last year,will add $40 billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to $646billion by the end of 1995.   Dukakis, in last Sunday's debate, accused Bush of planning to``raid the Social Security trust fund'' to help reduce the deficitand pay for tax cuts and Pentagon weapons.   Bush has said repeatedly he will not touch Social Security. Itis the one program he plans to exempt from his ``flexible freeze''to curb the deficit.   A Bush spokesman, David Sandor, dismissed Dukakis' raid chargeas ``an effort to terrorize America's elderly into politicalsubmission.''   The Republican commissioner of Social Security, Dorcas Hardy,points out that Dukakis recently used $27 million in surpluspension funds to help balance the Massachusetts budget.   Social Security didn't save Carter or Mondale, but Sen. BobDole, R-Kan., said it was the issue that cost Republicans controlof the Senate in 1986.   Dukakis advises, ``When it comes to Social Security and GeorgeBush, don't read his lips, read his record.''   As president of the Senate, he cast a tie-breaking vote on May9, 1985, against exempting Social Security's cost-of-livingadjustment from a fiscal 1986 budget freeze. The tally was 50-49.   That freeze never materialized. Reagan, after initiallysupporting it, abandoned the package and it died. Afterwards, headopted a hands-off policy toward Social Security that he has stuckto _ and which Bush promises to emulate.   In 1981, in the throes of Social Security's difficulties and inhis quest to cut federal spending, Reagan sought sweeping cuts inbenefits for early retirees and others. Congress eliminated collegestudents' benefits and some others, but refused to go along withthe steepest cuts.   In this campaign, as in 1986, Mr. Senior Citizen himself,88-year-old Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, will be onthe airwaves attacking the Republicans on Social Security. TheNational Council of Senior Citizens is running Pepper ads attackingBush and distributing posters that scream, ``Bush whacked my SocialSecurity on May 9, 1985.''   Dukakis has charged that Bush would have to ``raid the trustfund'' if he is serious about reducing the deficit while buyingmore military weapons and cutting the capital gains tax.   In fact, the growing trust funds already help reduce the deficit.   Although Social Security's trust funds technically are listedapart from the government's other accounts, they are lumpedtogether for purposes of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.   Federal law prohibits spending Social Security's reserves onother programs, but every dollar added to the trust funds reducesthe overall deficit.   And since the trust funds must be invested in interest-bearingU.S. securities, they reduce the amount the government must borrowin private markets. The government uses the funds generated byselling bonds to Social Security to cover the operating deficit inthe rest of its programs.   Still, there have been calls for changes in Social Securityoutside the immediate political debate.   Bush's two main economic advisers, Martin Feldstein and MichaelBoskin, have been prominent academic critics of Social Security.   Feldstein has argued that Social Security depresses privatesavings. He also has proposed restricting cost-of-living increasesto the Consumer Price Index minus 2 percentage points.   Boskin, in a 1986 book, ``Too Many Promises: The UncertainFuture of Social Security,'' proposed to revamp Social Security toseparate its insurance and welfare aspects.   Robert Strauss, the former Democratic party chairman andco-chairman of the National Economic Commission, touched off afirestorm Sept. 20 when he said that if the budget is to bebalanced, then ``we have to go to Social Security, Medicare andentitlements generally and we have to go to defense.'' Both theDukakis and Bush campaigns disavowed Strauss' statement.   Other Democrats have spoken favorably of making more retireespay income tax on their benefits. Only one retiree in 10 now istaxed on Social Security.</TEXT></DOC>
