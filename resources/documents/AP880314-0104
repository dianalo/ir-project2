(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker has returned to the pulpit forthe first time in more than a year, preaching from a small woodenlectern to elderly, suntanned retirees at a trailer park inCalifornia.   Tammy Faye Bakker introduced her husband to the crowd of 225campers at a service Sunday in Niland, Calif., according to areport in today's editions of The Charlotte Observer.   The campers were seated on folding metal chairs in a bingo hallthat doubles as a chapel, with a folding metal table serving as analtar, the newspaper said.   ``This has been a long, hard year for us,'' Mrs. Bakker said.``It hasn't been easy ... I am very happy to introduce to you myhusband. I would like to welcome him back to the place where hebelongs, in the pulpit, ministering the Gospel of Jesus Christ.   Jim Bakker, defrocked in May after the sex-and-money scandalover PTL, chose the remote corner of the California desert topreach again because his uncle, Charles ``Lonnie'' Irwin, is pastorof the park's Lutheran congregation during the winter.   Curious campers began arriving an hour before the 9 a.m.service. Thirty people who couldn't fit inside the buildinglistened through window screens.   One regular member of the congregation whispered to a friend:``It's not just the ordinary congregation. It's just a big show.How many people came to worship, really? How many came to justlook.?''   It has been nearly one year since Bakker gave up his ministry atPTL, south of Charlotte, admitting he had sex with Jessica Hahn andthat money had been promised to keep her silent.   Bakker preached about friendship for 30 minutes, then grinnedand hugged members of the congregation.   ``I've always said over the years if I could give you a gift,the most important gift would be a good friend,'' Bakker saidduring his sermon. ``That's besides Jesus.''   Bakker quoted again and again from the Bible about the value ofa good friend and God's commandment to love one's enemies.   After Bakker ended his sermon with a prayer, the congregationclapped. He and his wife then greeted everyone as they walked outthe door. Jeannie Morgan, 63, of Stanford, Wash., looked ecstaticafter she shook their hands.   ``Seeing the real thing and having it here is perfect,'' shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
