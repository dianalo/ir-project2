<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0410 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fiber optic diode array process analyzer has been developed and installedin a radiochemical separations facility at the Savannah River Plant.The analyzer monitors the uranium and nitrate concentration of sevenaqueous process streams in a uranium purification process. The analyzerremotely controls the sampling of each process stream and monitors therelative flow rate through each sampler. Spectrophotometric data fromthe analyzer is processed by multivariate data analysis to give bothuranium and nitrate concentrations as well as an indication of the qualityof the data. The analyzer system consists of a DuPont Instruments diodearray process analyzer, xenon arc lamp, fiber-optic multiplexer, andIBM industrial AT computer. Fused silica optical fibers (600 micrometercore diameter) connect the analyzer to monitor up to ten locations inseries. In addition to the seven process locations, the analyzer alsomonitors a reference optical fiber and an inline uranyl nitrate standard.Process stream samplers are controlled by Opto 22 hardware and electricsolenoid valves interfaced to the analyzer computer through an RS-422communication link. Absorption data from each location is fed into aPartial Least Squares (PLS) model of the uranyl nitrate system for conversioninto uranium and nitrate concentrations. The model also outputs a residualvariance which is a very sensitive indicator of interferences in thesystem and is used to verify the quality of the calculated results. Resultsfrom the analyzer computer are sent by another Opto 22 interface to adistributed control system which is used to run the uranium purificationprocess. 8 refs., 22 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
