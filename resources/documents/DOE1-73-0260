Potassium lowers the meltingtemperature in the CaO-SiO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ system. This is especiallyimportant when fuels rich in alkalies like wood are used. Another criticalsituation is when reducing conditions are used in the bed. CaSO/sub 4/is then reduced to CaS and the resultant sulfate - sulfide mixture hasan eutectic region at 830 - 1200 degrees C depending on which other elementsare present. Initial results from calculations using a thermodynamicmodel on the system CaO-SiO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-K/sub 2/O are alsoreported. The liquidus temperatures obtained from such calculations donot agree very well with experimental ones. However, relative trendslike the effect of additives on a specific ash composition may be evaluatedby the thermodynamic model.</TEXT></DOC>
