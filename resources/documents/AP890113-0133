(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An electronics company and six men, thefirst group indicted in the Pentagon purchasing investigation,pleaded innocent Friday to charges they paid or took money forinside information about a multimillion-dollar defense contract.   U.S. District Court Judge Richard Williams set a trial date ofMarch 27 for Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., adivision of Teledyne Industries; for three Teledyne employees,George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer; for twoprivate consultants, William Parkin and Fred Lackner, and for a Navypurchashing official, Stuart Berlin.   The defendants were released on $10,000 personal recognizancebonds.   The charges, which range from conspiracy to bribery, arecontained in a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jurylast week.   They are the first resulting from the federal government'stwo-year-old investigation into allegations that private consultantspaid bribes to defense employees for information about contracts letby the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing office.   At the arraignment, each defendant pleaded not-guilty to allcounts against him. All face charges of conspiracy and bribery, andsome face other charges.   Teledyne's attorney, Thomas Patten, asked Williams to postponethe trial ``because we have a daunting task in front of us.''   Later, Patten said he felt his client should be afforded moretime to develop its defense because the government spent over twoyears to work on its end.   Another attorney, George O'Connell, who represents Sullivan, aTeledyne Electronics executive, told Williams that he has met with``lengthy delays and stonewalling'' in trying to interview keyPentagon employees about the case.   But Joseph Aronica, an assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutorshave ``no intention of impeding access to witnesses.'' Williamssuggested the two sides try to work out their differences beforeresorting to legal maneuvers.   Gerard Treanor, an attorney for Parkin, said, ``We anticipateafter the trial he will be acquitted.''   Berlin, the Navy man, was asked whether he thought he would beexonerated. ``Sure do,'' he responded.   The indictment alleges that Teledyne Electronics and itsemployees paid Parkin, of Alexandria, Va., to obtain details about aNavy radar contract worth more than $100 million. Parkin then paidLackner, a consultant based in Woodland Hills, Calif., who in turngave bribes to Berlin, the indictment says.   Prosecutors said Berlin's information played a role in landingthe contract for Teledyne Electronics.   Berlin, Parkin and Lackner face maximum penalties of 185 years inprison and fines of $5.5 million each, if convicted on all counts.Teledyne Electronics faces a fine of $6.5 million if convicted. Theother men face lesser sentences if found guilty.   Prosecutors have said they plan to develop the case with the helpof testimony from Michael Savaides, a former employee of TeledyneElectronics who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery.He is cooperating with prosecutors.   After the indictment was made public, the Defense Departmentsuspended Berlin without pay and barred Teledyne Electronics fromdoing business with any agency of the government.   The Pentagon also suspended the Hazeltine Corp. and two of itsformer exeutives who have entered guilty pleas in the massivePentagon investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
