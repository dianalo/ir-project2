The sectarian strife threatened to reignite a 13-year civilconflict that has taken more than 130,000 lives.   Today's scheduled session of Parliament to elect a new chief ofstate was called off after President Amin Gemayel named an interimmilitary government led by a Christian. The Maronite Catholicpresident announced the caretaker Cabinet on Thursday night _ fiveminutes before his six-year term expired.   Moslem leaders branded his move a virtual coup and vowed supportfor the existing Moslem-led Cabinet.   The denunciations came Thursday on a day of renewed religiousviolence. Three leaders of the main Shiite Moslem militia, Amal,were assassinated earlier in the day, and Christians battledMoslems for two hours along Beirut's dividing Green Line. OneChristian was reported killed.   Though Gemayel's move was aimed at assuring a measure of unityin the crisis, it initially appeared to have the opposite effect.Three Moslem appointees immediately refused to serve in theCabinet, now led by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a MaroniteCatholic.   ``This is a midget coup d'etat. It's not going to lift off theground,'' said Druse Moslem chieftain Walid Jumblatt in a statementbroadcast by Moslem radio stations in Beirut.   Jumblatt said the ``only legal government is that of actingPrime Minister Salim Hoss,'' a Sunni Moslem.   Gemayel's choice of Aoun as prime minister came after leadingMoslem politicians refused to take part in an interim Cabinetheaded by a civilian Maronite prime minister.   An unwritten national covenant calls for Lebanon's president tobe a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speakerof Parliament a Shiite Moslem.   Gemayel, 45, named the transition government because Parliament,deeply divided along religious lines, failed to elect a newpresident Thursday. Christian deputies opposed presidentialcandidates backed by Syria, the nation's main power broker, andboycotted voting.   Today's scheduled parliamentary session was the third failedattempt in five weeks to elect a new president.   ``The session is postponed until a date that will be announcedlater,'' said a terse statement read by Parliament Secretary IhsanAbu Khalil.   The constitution bars Gemayel from seeking another term.   Aoun, 53, had warned on Wednesday that his 42,000-man army wouldtake control of Lebanon if no new president was elected beforeGemayel's term expired.   But after the ceremony to hand over power, Aoun said: ``Myprogram is to arrange the speedy election of a new president.''   Aoun and his ministers, who represent the six main religioussects of Lebanon, keep their top military posts.   Refusals to serve in the caretaker Cabinet came quickly fromMaj. Gen. Mahmoud Abu Dergham, a Druse; Col. Lutfi Jaber, a Shiite;and Brig. Gen. Nabil Qoraitem, a Sunni.   Aoun, asked if he would govern with only two Christian membersbesides himself, said: ``I haven't been formally informed of their(the Moslems') rejection yet.''   Also named to Aoun's Cabinet were Col. Issam Abu Jamra, GreekOrthodox; and Brig. Gen Edgar Maalouf, Greek Catholic.   Aoun will probably not be able to cross the Green Line into theMoslem sector, where the prime minister's office is located.Military sources said he was commuting between the presidentialBaabda Palace and his headquarters in nearby Yarze today.   In his televised farewell address, Gemayel said,``Today shouldhave been a festival in which we rejoice over the election of a newpresident .... But the people of war were stronger than peace.''   A police spokesman said Amal leaders Daoud Daoud, Mahmoud Fakihand Hassan Sbeiti died instantly when gunmen raked their car withmachine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades in south Beirut'sseaside Ouzai district.   Daoud and Fakih led an April crackdown on Hezbollah, theIranian-backed Party of God organization. Security sources saidHezbollah vowed to kill them, but no group immediately claimedresponsibility.   Two of the three candidates running for president _ formerPresident Suleiman Franjieh, 78, and Parliament Deputy MikhailDaher, 58 _ were chosen by Syria, which has about 40,000 troops inLebanon.   The third, veteran politician Raymond Edde, 75, opposes allforeign meddling in Lebanon. He leads in public opinion polls.</TEXT></DOC>
