Fortunately, Saddam and histroops didn't get the word.   We are told that the cruise missile, the Apache helicopterand the Stealth fighter didn't perform up to par. Neither, itseems, did the Patriot missile -- which some apparently wouldhave us believe was repeatedly knocked out of the sky bySaddam's Scuds.</LP><TEXT>   It is said less damage would have occurred had the Scudsnot been intercepted at all. This despite the fact that oneScud, which went unengaged and hit a U.S. barracks, producedmore American casualties from enemy action than weresustained in the entire ground offensive. Israeli neighborserected a sign near one Patriot battery proclaiming, &quot;Yankee,stay here]&quot; Patriots almost certainly enabled Israel to stayout of the war -- avoiding the profound consequences thatcould have followed.   Under such circumstances, one can't help being reminded ofthose economists who, whenever any action works well in thebusiness world, rejoin, &quot;Yes, but would it have worked intheory?&quot; What is surprising is that we should be surprisedthat our hardware in the Persian Gulf worked. That is, afterall, what it was designed to do.   This is not to say that in modern warfare, technology iseverything. The next war won't necessarily be won by the sidewith the last antenna standing. (Our soldiers, sailors,marines, airmen and coast guardsmen were so good that theywould have won the Gulf War with the other side's hardware.)What we saw in the Gulf War was a victory of the technologyof the 1970s (most of the equipment used in the Persian Gulfwas originally developed some two decades ago), themanufacturing of the 1980s, and the people of the 1990s. Itproved to be an unbeatable combination -- a true case ofspending dollars today rather than spending lives tomorrow.   The story that has yet to be told, however, is how veryclose we came not to having all that high-tech hardware inthe first place and how the obstacles in our hardwareacquisition process might have lost the technological war forus. In fact, we came perilously close to not having&quot;invisible&quot; airplanes, not owning the night, not having&quot;smart&quot; munitions that could select the room within abuilding to hit, not possessing some of the spacecraft thatconstituted the new high ground over the desert, and nothaving a &quot;bullet that could hit a bullet.&quot;   In the case of virtually every one of the systems that hadso forceful an impact in the desert -- Patriot, LANTIRN,Maverick, Blackhawk, JSTARS, Apache, Hellfire, Tomahawk,Bradley, the M-1 Abrams tank, to name but a few -- there weretimes during research and development when severe technicalproblems were encountered. This seems to be characteristic ofeven the best-managed projects that operate near the edge ofthe technological frontier.   The extremely successful and durable Sidewinder missile,for example, failed in its first 13 test flights. In thespace program, 10 of the first 11 rockets launched in the1960s to gather data on moon landing sites were failures.   At such times it was often argued that the thing to do wasto cancel these &quot;trouble-plagued-projects&quot; (as the criticsbranded them) and start anew on projects that would have nosuch problems. To have done so often would have been the morepopular approach with elements of the media, parts of thepublic, some of the Congress, most of the auditors, and evensegments of the military itself.   Fortunately, the developers did not stop -- although, attimes, the life expectancy of these systems seemed shorterthan that of an Iraqi tank. The result is history. Theworld's fourth largest Army, well-experienced in combat, some8,000 miles away, was defeated in a 1,000-hour air war and a100-hour ground war -- with personnel and equipmentcasualties favoring the coalition by a ratio of 1,000 to 1.   There are, of course, those occasional circumstances wherecanceling a suffering project is the wisest course. That'swhere management judgment comes in. But in general, thecorrect answer is, first, not to start projects until it isabsolutely clear they are needed and affordable and, second,once started, to diligently solve the problems that willinvariably be confronted. Bluntly stated, &quot;Tough It Out.&quot;Wars are not won with good ideas memorialized in laboratoriesany more than economies are built with research that otherstake to the marketplace.   It is astonishing what the defense acquisition system canaccomplish when it is unfettered. In World War II, it built aLiberty ship in four days; in the Gulf War, it was able todevelop, test and send into combat, over a span of a fewweeks, a huge laser-guided bomb (made from a cannon barrel])against deep underground command centers in Iraq.   Perhaps the best example of all is the Patriot&quot;Scudbuster.&quot; The Patriot missile is assembled by MartinMarietta under contract to Raytheon Corp., the system's primecontractor.   Patriot very nearly was the &quot;defense system that wasn't.&quot;It came perilously close to Pentagon cancellation at leasttwice and was the target of several termination efforts inCongress during a prolonged and painful 18-year development.   On Aug. 2, the day the Iraqi army rolled into Kuwait,there were only three anti-Scud Patriot missiles in existence-- in spite of the facts that somewhere on this planet thereare about 10,000 Scuds, that about 1,000 ballistic missilesof one kind or another are fired each year, and that some2,000 ballistic missiles have been fired in anger. ThesePatriot missiles were first-generation, experimental modelsintended for testing. Initial operational missiles were notscheduled for delivery for another five months.   Relieved of the sometimes burdensome restrictions of thedefense acquisition process and fully supported by themilitary, numerous contractors and several labor unions, allthe stops were pulled and 17 Patriot missiles, the first ofhundreds in the pipeline, were quickly assembled.   Dedicated employees literally worked around the clock,including Thanksgiving and Christmas. Scores of suppliers,for everything from nuts and bolts to rocket motors andgyroscopes, accelerated shipments. The government assignedtop priority to deliveries, in some cases reducing paper workrequirements to hours from weeks.   One anti-Scud missile was rushed to White Sands, where itwas successfully flight tested -- and the others weredispatched by air to the Persian Gulf to report for duty. Therecord for an individual missile over the course of the war,from the time it left the assembly line in the U.S. until itintercepted a Scud over Israel, was two days -- lending newmeaning to the concept of just-in-time manufacturing.   It is difficult to do things that have never been donebefore -- that is what research and development is all about.Sometimes almost as much perseverance is required in thelaboratory as on the battlefield. Military Randamp;D, like war, isnot for the faint of heart.   ---   Mr. Augustine, a former Army undersecretary underPresident Ford, is CEO of Martin Marietta Corp. and aco-author, with Kenneth Adelman, of &quot;The Defense Revolution&quot;(ICS Press, 1990).</TEXT></DOC>
