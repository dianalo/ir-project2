In the spatially one-dimensional,cold, and collisionless plasma the large-amplitude plasma oscillationis limited by the nonlinearity caused by relativistic effects. In thispaper a simple nonlinear equation, resembling the original equation ofRosenbluth and Liu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 29, 701 (1972)], is derived in theweak beat power limit from the fully relativistic fluid model proposedby Sprangle, Sudan, and Tang [Appl. Phys. Lett. 45, 375 (1984); Phys.Fluids 28, 1974 (1985)]. This equation also contains the effects of therelativistic transverse motion. Its analytical solution, describing theplasma oscillation dynamics, is given in a closed form by using Jacobianelliptic functions. The analytical computations are compared with numericalcomputations. Finally the fully relativistic equation, describing freeplasma oscillations, is studied analytically.</TEXT></DOC>
