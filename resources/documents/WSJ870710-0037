The fund will include money remaining from Kohlberg's $2 billion raised in 1985.    Kohlberg Kravis is the leading firm involved in leveraged buyouts. But the closely held concern has been facing increasing competition from investment banks.

Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
