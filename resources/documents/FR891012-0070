Except as noted below, all changesbeing published are editorial in nature, and reflect organization, address,and other minor administrative changes which have occurred since the previouspublication of the material in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The three revised notices are published in theirentirety below.Two systems of records notices are being deleted from the Department'scompilation of systems notices describing records subject to the PrivacyAct. A review was recently conducted by the MMS of its Privacy Act recordsconcerning information being maintained on entrepreneurs. The review wasprompted by an opinion issued by the General Counsel, Office of Managementand Budget (OMB), on August 30, 1988, affirming OMB's 1975 guidelines whichinterpreted the statutory term ``individual'' to exclude natural personsacting in an entrepreneurial capacity from the coverage of the PrivacyAct. In a memorandum dated March 8, 1989, the Department's Office of theSolicitor affirmed the opinion's applicability within the Department andclarified the extent of coverage under the Privacy Act of information maintainedon entrepreneurs.MMS's review indicated that two of its systems of records contain onlyinformation about persons in their entrepreneurial capacity and not intheir capacity as individuals. Therefore, the two notices listed beloware being deleted from the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systemsof records notices.1. Mineral Lease and Royalty Accounting Files_Interior, MMS-1 (previouslypublished on March 17, 1986; 51 FR 9122).2.
