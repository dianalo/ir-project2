(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, histelevision outlets dwindling, says his troubled worldwide ministryis ``scraping the bottom.''   As three major cable networks dropped Swaggart's programs, theembattled minister took to the airwaves this week, not to preachfire-and-brimestone gospel of his television ministry but to pleadfor $6 million.   ``We have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministrygoing,'' Swaggart said during a televised appeal with his wifeFrances and son Donnie. ``Stations will cancel if we cannot paythem. We cannot pay them what we do not have.''   Swaggart left the Assemblies of God, the nation's largestPentecostal denomination, on April 8 after refusing to abide by aone-year suspension from the pulpit and television for hisconfession of moral failure.   Although Swaggart did not specify his sin during a tearfulconfession to his congregation on Feb. 21, two church officialshave said that Swaggart told them a prostitute posed nude for himwhile he watched.   The evangelist has said he plans to return to the pulpit on May22, in accordance with a three-month suspension ordered by statedenomination officials. That decision was later overturned bynational church leaders.   In his fund-raising plea, Swaggart said his church faces ``themost crucial time of any ministry in the history of the world. ...We are scraping the bottom.''   One of the cable networks that dropped Swaggart was PTL, whichitself has been rocked by financial losses since former Assembliesof God minister Jim Bakker stepped down last year after admittingto adultery.   PTL earlier had decided to remove Swaggart's programs if hefailed to abide by the one-year suspension. The CBN cable networkcanceled Swaggart's programs earlier and Black EntertainmentTelevision, another cable outlet, dropped the evangelist last week.The three networks reach about 70 million homes.   Since his departure from the denomination, contributions to theJimmy Swaggart World Ministries have dropped sharply, at leastseven ministers in key administrative positions have left and astate appeals court has said that fellow defrocked evangelistMarvin Gorman should have his day in court in a lawsuit he filedagainst Swaggart.   The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate reported that after the scandalbroke, contributions fell quickly from $500,000 per day to possiblybelow the $350,000 the ministry needs to stay afloat. Ministryofficials have refused to comment.   Last month, Swaggart's wife and son staged a week-long televisedfundraiser in which they described the ministry's financialcondition as critical. Ministry officials would not say how muchmoney was raised.   Swaggart said that regardless of what happens, he will be backin the pulpit on May 22. ``If May 22 doesn't hurry up and get here,I am going out behind the house and preach to the frogs,'' he saidwith a chuckle.   Gorman, who reportedly photographed Swaggart outside a seedymotel with a woman and later turned the pictures over to churchofficials, claims in his $190 million suit that Swaggart plotted toruin his ministry through a smear campaign accusing him of a seriesof adulterous affairs with women he had counseled.</TEXT></DOC>
