This year's running of the bulls came a day after two bombsexploded in the city, wrecking two cars but injuring no one.   During the run 29 people suffered bruises and scrapes afterfalling or being trampled by the bulls and the steers guiding themthrough a half-mile of narrow streets in Pamplona's old quarter.Police said one young woman fainted and hurt herself when she fellto the ground.   The weeklong festival is held annually from July 6-14 in honor ofSan Fermin, Pamplona's patron saint.   Hemingway's 1926 novel, ``The Sun Also Rises,'' describes indetail the rowdy, round-the-clock festival that starts daily withthe morning runs of the bulls. Each evening, matadors kill the sixbulls that ran that morning.   In the first running today, the bulls covered the half-mile fromtheir pens to the bull ring in three minutes, 10 seconds.   Thursday's bombs wrecked the cars of two politicians who belongto the Popular Union party, police said. The group is widelybelieved to be the political arm of the Basque separatist group ETA.   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.   ETA, whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Liberty, haskilled more than 600 people since it began a violent campaign forindependence for the northern, three-province Basque region in 1968.   Pamplona is the capital of the autonomous region of Navarre,which borders the Basque region. ETA also seeks the annexation ofNavarre.   During the festival, the city's population of 200,000 balloons todouble its size because of the influx of tourists from around theworld.   The event, first held in 1394, has been held each year since1591. Since then, bulls have gored 52 people to death, including 13since 1924, according to city records.</TEXT></DOC>
