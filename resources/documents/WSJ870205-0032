The report, released after yesterday's close, comes on the heels of a strong futures market, spurred on by analysts' predictions in the past week that total cattle inventory would be down about 5% from year-earlier levels. The report, however, found only a 3% decline, with a total inventory level of about 102 million head of cattle, compared with about 105 million head a year ago.    Much of the increase can be attributed to the calf-crop numbers, the number of calves born during the year, according to analysts. The calf-crop population, according to the report, was about 41.2 million as of Jan. 1, compared with last year's level of about 41 million.    &quot;The deviation in the calf-crop accounts for all the deviation. If the calf-crop had been down 3% as pre-release estimates were, the number on farms would have been about the same as expected,&quot; says Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.    The calf-crop numbers are comparable with those of last year despite the fact that last year's report found that 3% fewer cows gave birth and that there were 2% fewer heifers over 500 pounds, Mr. Abbenhaus added.    Although the decline in the current report wasn't as great as expected, the inventory level is the lowest since 1962, analysts said. Because of this, they said, the report should be considered as friendly.    &quot;We're at the point where the market has to pull back and digest this thing and then go forward,&quot; says Charles Richardson, an analyst with Lind-Waldock andamp; Co. in Denver. &quot;Everybody is going to have take a step back and regroup.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Most oil futures prices drifted lower for the third consecutive day amid weak demand for distillates, analysts and traders said. &quot;The weakness in the product market continues to lead oil prices down,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. Some of the price losses stemmed from traders selling contracts to offset those bought earlier, brokers said. Heating oil futures prices led the decline on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with contracts for March delivery skidding 0.73 cent, to 49.50 cents a gallon. March crude oil contracts slipped 10 cents, to $18.26 a barrel, while most unleaded gasoline contracts posted slight gains. Many traders apparently shrugged off a drop in U.S. refinery utilization reported by an industry group after the market closed Tuesday. The American Petroleum Institute's figures, showing that domestic refiners operated at 80% of capacity for the week ended Jan. 30, compared with 81.1% the week before, portend less refined products on the market in the weeks ahead. Nevertheless, for the time being, &quot;There's still too much product out there,&quot; said Chris McCormack, oil broker for E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York. Separately, Alick Buchanan-Smith, Britain's minister of state for energy, reaffirmed Britain's resolve to let its oil companies set production levels in the North Sea. In a news briefing at the New York Merc yesterday, Mr. Buchanan-Smith said that despite recent cooperation by non-OPEC nations to cut output, British oil companies won't be requested to make cutbacks. &quot;The hallmark of our policy is to let companies make their own commercial decisions on production levels,&quot; Mr. Buchanan-Smith said.    SUGAR: Profit-taking following Tuesday's strong advance depressed futures prices. The March contract fell 0.20 cent to 7.65 cents a pound. Analysts said the aggressive buying that characterized Tuesday's session failed to appear yesterday, prompting traders to sell contracts. A weakening factor also, they said, was the Common Market's unexpectedly large offering of 81,000 tons of refined beet sugar. &quot;It's not really a negative situation,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;It's just that there has been good physical business lately and some important developments as well, and the market has to digest them.&quot;    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices closed lower on relatively light volume in what traders said was partly a delayed reaction to Tuesday's stronger than expected U.S. economic data for December. &quot;Overseas traders overreact to bearish news on the U.S. economy and dollar, and underreact to bullish news,&quot; said Michael Ptack, a trader with Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va. &quot;The market was very choppy and thin, dominated by professionals,&quot; added Robin Bauer, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. vice president. She estimated that despite the dollar's rebound, the &quot;trend is still up&quot; in West German mark futures, predicting a near-term trading range of 0.5500 to 0.5600 for mark futures for March delivery. </TEXT></DOC>
