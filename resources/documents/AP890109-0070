RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother jailed since August 1987 for refusingto disclose the whereabouts of her daughter, whom she says wassexually abused by the child's father, lost a Supreme Court appealtoday.   The justices, without comment, let stand a contempt citationagainst Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.   Morgan, 41, was imprisoned in August 1981 for defying an order byDistrict of Columbia Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. that she allow herdaughter, Hilary, then 5, to spend a two-week unsupervised visitwith Dr. Eric A. Foretich.   Foretich is Hilary's father and Morgan's former husband.   Morgan sent the child into hiding to protect her, she said, fromsexual abuse by Foretich, who has denied abusing his daughter.   The judge last Dec. 15 refused to free Morgan after more than 15months in jail, saying he is not convinced her imprisonment willfail to coerce her into disclosing Hilary's whereabouts.   ``The coercion has only just begun,'' Dixon said. He added, ``Itcould be a month, it could be a year, it could be more than that''before he is convinced ``there is no realistic possibility of herrelenting.''   Morgan has been held in civil contempt, imposed to coerce someoneinto complying with a court order. The citation requiresimprisonment for an indefinite period. Criminal contempt, bycontrast, is imposed for a limited sentence as punishment.   In her Supreme Court appeal, Morgan said her rights were violatedbecause Dixon conducted much of the hearing that led to the contemptcitation in private.   The judge said he was trying to protect Hilary from publicdisclosure of the details of her father's alleged sexual abuse. Manyof the specific charges were made public in a separate federal courtsuit against Foretich by Morgan.   Dixon ruled in 1986 that Morgan failed to prove Foretich hadabused Hilary. He said there was equal evidence on both sides of thecase. The judge permitted brief supervised visits for the father,and in August 1987 granted Foretich a two-week unsupervised visitthat led Morgan to send her daughter into hiding.   Morgan said Dixon was biased against her, and wrongly refused tobelieve evidence indicating Hilary had been abused.   An appeals court here ruled last August that Morgan's rights werenot violated.   ``A review of the record shows that there was proabable evidenceon both sides of the issue of abuse,'' the appeals court said. Itadded that it is unable to conclude that Dixon was ``clearlyerroneous'' in granting Foretich a two-week visit.   The appeals court noted that a court-appointed guardian forHilary opposed the visit but had not argued that Dixon abused hisdiscretion in ordering the visit.   The appeals court also upheld Dixon's decision to bar the publicfrom hearing Morgan's testimony about specific alleged acts ofsexual abuse.   Morgan said the public has been prevented from hearing crucialevidence that is vital to an issue of national debate.   Her lawyers said studies show that sex abuse charges are made insome 2 percent of contested custody and visitation cases.   Calling the figure one of ``alarming frequency,'' they saiddoubts have been raised about the ability of judges to referee suchdisputes.   Growing numbers of ``desperate parents have ... taken theirchildren and disappeared'' because the parents ``have lost faith inthe willingness and ability of the judicial system to protect theirchildren,'' Morgan's appeal said.   The case is Morgan vs. Foretich, 88-737.</TEXT></DOC>
