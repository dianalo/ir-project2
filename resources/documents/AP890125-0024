SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Big government in Washington may get the mostpublicity, but a new Census Bureau report shows that government isbig business in the rest of the country as well, with more than ahalf-million Americans holding elective office.   From school board president to the nation's president, Congressto county commissioner, public officials total 504,404, the bureaureported Tuesday in a study based on its 1987 census of governments.   That's up from 490,807 elected officials counted a decadeearlier, the bureau said.   ``It's quite a statement about the extent of democracy,particularly the grassroots democracy, in the country,'' said DianaCull, a census statistician who compiled the figures.   It means the United States now has more officeholders than banktellers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated there were 467,000tellers in 1987.   But while the report found that holding public office iswidespread, it also shows officeholders don't necessarily representa cross-section of the nation.   Only 20 percent were women, while 2 percent were blacks and 1percent were Hispanic. Nationally, women make up just over half thepopulation while the nation is about 12 percent black and 7 percentHispanic.   Most of the growth in elected officeholders since 1977 resultsfrom the growth of special districts around the nation, Ms. Cullsaid. These include independent water and sewer districts, housingauthorities, transit administrations and similar independent bodieswith elected boards.   Special districts accounted for 80,509 elected officials on29,532 governmental bodies in the 1987 study. That's up from 72,377officeholders running 25,962 special districts in 1977.   That increase of more than 8,000 officials was well ahead of anyother group, although special districts were only fourth in thetotal number of officeholders. Municipalities, towns and schooldistricts continue to have larger totals of officials elected topublic office.   The leading group is municipalities, with 137,688 officialsserving 19,200 communities in 1987. That's up from 134,017officeholders in 18,862 municipalities in 1977.   Townships came in second in both years, totaling 120,790officials in 1987 and 118,966 a decade earlier year. During thatperiod the total number of township governments declined from 16,822to 16,691.   School districts were the nation's third largest job source forelected officials, providing offices for 86,772 people in 1987. Thatwas down from 1977, however, when 87,062 people held elected schoolboard positions.   That drop occurred in parallel with a decline in the number ofschool districts in the nation, slipping from 15,174 to 14,721.   The nation's 3,042 counties _ the same in both studies _ providedsomewhat fewer elected offices in 1987 than in 1977. The total fellfrom 62,922 to 59,932.   The states, meanwhile, increased their number of elected offices.They harbored 18,171 elected officials in 1987, up from 15,294 in1977.   The 1977 report did not include figures for federalofficeholders. The new study put that number at 542, a total whichMs. Cull said was unchanged.   Elected federal officials include 435 members of the House, 100senators, five congressional delegates from territories and theDistrict of Columbia and, of course, the president and vicepresident.   The 1987 report looked at the characteristics of local governmentofficials for the first time, Cull said.   It found that women were most likely to be on school boards,making up 26.5 percent of elected school officials. Womenconstituted 23.1 percent of township officials and 20.8 percent ofcounty officers. They were 18.5 percent of the municipal officialsand only 11.5 percent of those serving on special districts.   Blacks, on the other hand, were most often represented onmunicipal governments, holding 3.3 percent of those posts.   Blacks made up 2.6 percent of the county officials and 2.4percent of school district officeholders. They were 0.6 percent ofthe special district officials and 0.4 percent in town offices.   School districts were the most common spot for Hispanics, at 1.8percent. They held 1.3 percent of municipal offices and 1.2 percentin special districts. Hispanics comprised 1 percent of countyofficials and 0.2 percent of town officers.</TEXT></DOC>
