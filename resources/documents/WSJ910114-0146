Most Americans understand at a very base level that oil,for better or worse, is the lifeblood of the world economy.To allow Saddam Hussein to achieve hegemony in the MiddleEast and to exercise his will through threat and intimidationagainst his neighbors is to invite long-term economicdisaster for the world community. If this is not a &quot;U.S.vital interest,&quot; then I am at a loss to find an interest thatis vital.</LP><TEXT>   Second, Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator who hasredirected his country's oil wealth not for the betterment ofhis people but to accumulate massive military hardware andfund an army many times the size necessary for any defensivepurpose. He has developed and used weapons of massdestruction against his own people. He has raped andplundered a defenseless neighbor, not for any high moralpurpose, but for oil, money and power.   Third, to dismiss the extraordinary coalition of statesexpressing unity on this question as a &quot;multilateral facadefor a unilateral U.S. war&quot; is ridiculous. Who could ever haveimagined that the members of the U.N. Security Council andthe disparate military coalition that the administration hasput together could agree on anything, let alone 12resolutions of condemnation against Iraq, including oneendorsing the use of force. The world community has certainlynot &quot;push{ed its} opponent against a locked door.&quot; The doorback into Iraq is wide open.   If all efforts to find a peaceful solution fail, and itcomes to war, Mr. Schlesinger and others vastly underestimatethe capabilities of our military. Iraq will be renderedmilitarily impotent within days. The massive use of forcethat will be unleashed against Saddam Hussein will be unlikeanything he can imagine. This is the message theadministration has been trying to get across to Saddam andone he has apparently yet to grasp.   D. Marden Miller   Dallas   ---   Finally, someone has written the definitive article on theabsurdity of our going to war in the Gulf. Also, Mr.Schlesinger is the first commentator I'm aware of (other thanlate-night comedians) who has derided the role of the vicepresident. I have no problem with Dan Quayle having joinedthe National Guard during the Vietnam War, an option Irecommended to friends after my own Vietnam service, but itis the height of hypocrisy for Mr. Quayle to be exhorting thetroops to battle when he refused the call himself.
