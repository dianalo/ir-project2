Mrs. Reagan believed she was ``spreading herself too thin''because she was becoming increasingly involved with her ownfoundation, her upcoming book and charitable work on behalf ofcancer patients, her spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Friday.   The proposal drew fire from neighbors who complained thetreatment center would attract drug addicts and could increasecrime. The former first lady announced in May she would likelywithdraw her support for the center.   The planned residential drug rehabilitation center at a vacanthospital building was to have been operated by Phoenix House.   ``This is a major disappointment to us,'' said Chris Policano,spokesman in New York City for Phoenix House, a private foundationthat operates drug programs across the country. ``There had been noprior dissension. It was a surprise.''   Phoenix House notified donors of Mrs. Reagan's request, but alsoinformed them it believes it is legally obligated to use the fundsfor a drug treatment center in the Los Angeles area.   ``I don't think there's any legal obligation on the part ofPhoenix House, which received gifts, to forward them to any othercharity,'' said Assistant Attorney General Carole Ritts Kornblum,who gave an opinion at the request of the drug treatment program.   So far, three people who gave a total of $65,000 have asked thattheir donations be returned or transferred, Policano said. PhoenixHouse hasn't decided what to do with the donations, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
