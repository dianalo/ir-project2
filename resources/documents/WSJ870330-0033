The U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington ordered that the sanction wouldn't take effect until it has a chance to rule on Mr. Blinder's appeal of the SEC action.    Earlier, the SEC granted a stay of a separate ruling barring the firm from initiating securities transactions for 45 days until the appeals court hears the firm's appeal of the sanction. At that time, the SEC refused to grant a similar stay to Mr. Blinder. Mr. Blinder then asked the appeals court for a stay.    The SEC sanctions against the firm and Mr. Blinder were handed down in December. The rulings stem from a 1980 underwriting by Mr. Blinder and his firm of American Leisure Corp., a casino company, in New York. The SEC accused the brokerage of fraud in the deal.    Mr. Blinder and the brokerage have denied all allegations. </TEXT></DOC>
