In an interview, the president also said he welcomesinvestments by foreign oil companies in Venezuela's petroleumindustry -- but in &quot;downstream&quot; joint ventures such asrefineries and petrochemical plants. Except for some marginalfields being offered to bidders for redevelopment, he ruledout any direct stakes by foreign companies in Venezuela'scrude oil production.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We cannot have private exploitation because the lawprohibits it,&quot; said Mr. Perez, who was in his first term aspresident in 1976, when Venezuela's oil industry wasnationalized. He was in Houston over the weekend to addressthe Greater Houston Partnership's world trade division aftermeeting President Bush Friday in Washington.   It was at the urging of the Bush administration in Augustthat Venezuela, a major supplier of petroleum to the U.S. formany decades, began to expand rapidly its production capacityto help replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes lost to worldmarkets as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis. Saudi Arabia,the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela produced enoughadditional oil to enable the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to fill the gap.   Also, each country accelerated plans to expand capacity.The Perez administration set Venezuela's 1995 target at 3.5million barrels, one million barrels a day higher thancurrent capacity. But there has been some doubt the threeOPEC members would be willing to reduce their productionafter the Gulf crisis ended.   In the interview, however, President Perez made clear thatVenezuela would be willing to reduce production if necessary.&quot;There is no problem in returning to the quotas,&quot; he said.&quot;We have foreseen this,&quot; he added, noting that Venezuela hasbased its 1991 budget on production of 1.9 million barrels aday, its OPEC quota before the Gulf crisis, and a$16-a-barrel oil price.   Currently OPEC's oil prices, which lag behind those in theU.S. by around $2 a barrel, average about $18 a barrel. Mr.Perez said production is slightly more than 2.2 millionbarrels a day, down some 300,000 barrels a day from maximumcapacity.   But Mr. Perez believes OPEC's quotas ultimately willdisappear. &quot;Our view of the future oil market is that therewon't be any surplus of supply,&quot; he said. &quot;What isimportant,&quot; he added, &quot;is that we don't want to push pricesup&quot; by producing too little.   Still, Mr. Perez indicated that the price of oil should beslightly higher if Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oilcompany, is to meet its capacity goal at an estimated cost of$8 billion. &quot;Right now,&quot; he said, &quot;about $20 to $25 is a goodprice range.&quot; He didn't specify whether he was referring toVenezuelan crudes.   The 1976 nationalization gives Petroleos de Venezuela amonopoly on the nation's oil resources but permits someprivate-sector participation in special cases as long asstate control continues. An example is the offering of some50 marginal fields where redevelopment would be financed andoperated by outside companies but under the jurisdiction ofPetroleos de Venezuela. Many of these fields have been closedfor several years.   Mr. Perez said he recently appointed a special commission&quot;for an in-depth study&quot; of Venezuela's oil policies. Also, hesaid his administration is studying new ways of using futuresales of oil to finance some projects. And he cited severaljoint ventures that are being negotiated with foreigncompanies, such as a massive natural gas development andrefining projects in Venezuela.   Venezuela has been a leader among OPEC nations in buyinginto refining ventures abroad to ensure foreign markets forits crude oil. But now, Mr. Perez said, the emphasis will beon putting new refining joint ventures in Venezuela toprovide added value there for its oil industry. A letter ofintent has been signed with Germany's Veba AG for oneVenezuelan refining joint venture, and Mr. Perez saidVenezuela is going to sign another with Amoco Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
