He wouldn't even agree to interviews limited to seemingly innocuous subjects.    His unwillingness to talk with reporters irritated Donald Kendall, then chairman of parent PepsiCo Inc., who believed that executives could help soft drink sales by generating media interest in the business.&quot; I gave him a friendly lecture,&quot; said Mr. Kendall.    Actually, &quot;Kendall called up and chewed me out,&quot; Mr. Enrico recalled. But Mr. Enrico wouldn't budge: &quot;I thought it was self-aggrandizement. It didn't seem like it would be the right thing to do.&quot;    But Mr. Enrico, 42 years old, eventually was convinced that Pepsi sales would benefit with him as a personal spokesman. He has so thoroughly embraced the media that he has become one of the most well-known businessmen in the U.S.    In the past few months, his picture has been ever present -- in magazines, where it is used to advertise Visa credit cards and Hathaway shirts, and on the dust cover of a book he wrote on the cola business.    Such visibility, although arguably good for Pepsi, isn't without peril for Mr. Enrico. Some people in the industry suggest that he has pursued the attention for personal gain. Some of the bottlers who sell Pepsi products complain that Mr. Enrico is focusing so much on his own career that he isn't available to talk about how to help resolve their troubles.    Some of them were angry, for instance, when Mr. Enrico flew to Dallas for a soft-drink industry convention in October but stayed only one day. After a morning speech to the convention, he spent most of his visit giving interviews to reporters rather than meeting with bottlers, they said.    Aware of the concerns about his visibility, Mr. Enrico vowed in mid-October, during the height of the publicity, that he would &quot;go underground&quot; on Nov. 2 for a while. He has kept his word -- he has given no interviews since then, and even Pepsi's news releases don't use his name.    At the same time bottlers complain about the publicity, they admit that Mr. Enrico is a smart marketer. And although some people in the industry say there is the possibility of jealousy within PepsiCo, the company's new chairman, D. Wayne Calloway, recently showed his support by naming Mr. Enrico president of PepsiCo world-wide beverages.    Gerard R. Roche, chairman of the executive recruiting firm of Heidrick andamp; Struggles, said businessmen are generally leery of anyone who draws a lot of media attention. But in the end, he said, &quot;It doesn't do you any harm as long as you have the executive talent to back it up, and Enrico does.&quot;    Mr. Enrico has achieved some major business triumphs. This year, Pepsi's soft drink volume is up 7%, making it a bright spot for the parent company, which has been hurt by disappointing earnings in its restaurant and snack-food divisions. Mr. Enrico's division also created Slice, a soft drink with fruit juice that now is a major new category in the business.    Nevertheless, archrival Coca-Cola Co. has widened the gap between itself and second-place Pepsi-Cola in total soft-drink market share. According to Beverage Digest, Coke's gain of 0.6% from the first quarter to the second quarter this year compared with Pepsi's gain of 0.4%. Coke's total market share was 39.6% in the second quarter, and Pepsi's was 29.4%. A crucial test for Mr. Enrico will come in early 1987, when the company unveils its costly new advertising with singer Michael Jackson and attempts to sustain momentum in the face of Coke's gains.    Mr. Enrico was persuaded to write the book about the cola wars primarily as a way to blunt the effect of a book that was being written about Coke. Pepsi had to &quot;neutralize&quot; that book, and Mr. Enrico seemed like the right person to do it, said Joseph McCann, Mr. Enrico's former top public relations adviser and now vice president, corporate affairs, at PepsiCo.    Mr. Enrico said he hoped the book would show aspiring business people the importance of creativity and risk-taking. &quot;If they thought the right way to get ahead is to write memos and keep your nose clean, maybe it would change some minds,&quot; he said.    The book, which came out in October, coincided with the Visa and Hathaway ads featuring Mr. Enrico. The confluence of publicity prompted a Coke executive to remark that &quot;the ego has landed.&quot;    While Mr. Enrico thinks the publicity might have helped Pepsi by contributing to its image as a &quot;young, fun, with-it company,&quot; he also worries about how it makes him look. &quot;I get very apprehensive about these things,&quot; he said in an interview before going underground. &quot;It's risky, personally. I still don't know if those ads were the right thing to do, and I'm sure not interested in doing any more.&quot;    Some people who know him describe Mr. Enrico as infinitely confident in his abilities, with a tendency to focus on the short term rather than long term. He relies on his gut feelings.    James O'Neal, a longtime friend and senior vice president for operations at Frito-Lay Inc., the PepsiCo division where Mr. Enrico previously worked, said Mr. Enrico always was persistent. On a plant tour once, he saw Mr. Enrico corner the manager. &quot;He was telling him to put a little extra seasoning in his brand,&quot; he said. That kind of personal attention to the plant manager, he said, could have led to better treatment for the product that Mr. Enrico handled.    Mr. Enrico also can be impatient and demanding, however, and he doesn't agonize over decisions. When the company was trying to figure out a way to change its commercials, the agent for Mr. Jackson happened to call. &quot;I said, why not&quot; use the entertainer in a commercial, Mr. Enrico said. &quot;If it didn't work, it was only two spots.&quot;    Mr. Enrico gained the top job at Pepsi-Cola three years ago when John Sculley quit to go to Apple Computer Inc. Pepsi employees say that Mr. Enrico was initially wary of publicity partly because he believed Mr. Sculley had received too much, and felt that the &quot;cola wars&quot; weren't doing the company any good with consumers.    Mr. Enrico really plunged into the role of public spokesman a year and a half ago, when Coke removed its century-old brand from the shelves and came out with a new product. During that summer, he took the lead for Pepsi in twitting Coke about its move.    Although associates describe him as a private man, Mr. Enrico clearly enjoys being a star. He announced the company's second contract with Mr. Jackson earlier this year, for instance, by holding a big news conference at a New York nightclub.    Some bottlers have been grumbling about Mr. Enrico's publicity in part because it comes as they feel squeezed by the company's emphasis on new products such as Slice that are more costly to produce and require continual scrambling for more shelf space in the supermarket. While some bottlers criticized the idea of signing Mr. Jackson for a new $10 million ad campaign, Mr. Enrico is typically philosophical about the possible consequences.    &quot;What you do in business is bet on people,&quot; he said. &quot;My guess is that Michael will be the hottest thing in the country in 1987.&quot; And if he isn't?    &quot;It's an opportunity missed and probably we would have paid a little too much.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
