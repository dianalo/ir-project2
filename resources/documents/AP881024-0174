Ariel Sharon, who was forced out asdefense minister in 1983 after massacres of Palestinians inLebanon, said Monday he wants the job back and will crush therevolt in the occupied lands if he gets it.   Israeli soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers Monday in theWest Bank's Faraa refugee camp, killing a 17-year-old Palestinian,hospital officials said.   Mohammed Shaheed's death raised to at least 302 the number ofArabs killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 millionPalestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis alsohave been slain.   Sharon, a hero of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, was touring anoutdoor market when he expressed his desire to regain his old post.The area is a stronghold of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir'sconservative Likud bloc, for which Sharon is a candidate in theNov. 1 parliamentary elections.   ``After the elections, the first thing that must be done is torestore peace and quiet immediately'' in the occupied territories,said Sharon, who had a heavy guard of riot police.   ``That is what has to be done and I have the means to do it,''he told reporters.   Dozens of vegetable vendors and shoppers in the crowded MahaneYehuda Market cheered and showered the former general with candyand kisses. They called ``You're our man!'' and ``Only you can endthe intefadeh!'' using the Arabic word for uprising.   Yitzhak Rabin now is defense minister. He is a former primeminister and represents the Labor Party, which is in a fractiouscoalition with Likud and is led by Shamir's rival, Foreign MinisterShimon Peres.   The uprising and the future of the occupied territories havebecome major election issues. They filled most of the time Sundaynight in the only televised debate between Shamir and Peres.   Two independent newspaper polls said Monday that Peres won thedebate, but Labor and Likud are generally considered to be abouteven in the contest for the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel'sparliament.   The daily Haaretz said 21 percent of 400 Israelis telephonedafter the debate said Peres won and 12 percent said Shamir was thevictor.   Yediot Ahronot said it interviewed 460 people, and Peres wasrated highest on economic and peace-related issues. Most Israelianalysts say, however, that the effect of the debate on theelection is expected to be martinal.   Peres cut a tour of the northern town of Hadera short Mondayafter Likud supporters shouted him down. Peres shouted back angrilyseveral times, but finally left Hadera.   Sharon said on his hour-long visit to the the market that ``Icertainly can be one of those who can do the job well'' as defenseminister if Likud wins the election.   He resigned as defense minister in 1983, when Israeli forceswere occupying Lebanon, after an inquiry found him indirectlyresponsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in theSabra and Chatilla refugee camps by Lebanese militiamen allied withIsrael.   He has been industry and trade minister since 1984 and has madea political comeback, but has been staying out of the electionspotlight.   Moshe Behagon, Sharon's spokesman, said recent trips abroad fortrade talks were the reason for his few appearances, but partyofficials said Likud wanted to avoid reminding voters of theunpopular Lebanon war.   A Likud official suggested privately that Sharon's silence waspart of a power struggle with Moshe Arens, who is the Likudcampaign manager and also wants to be defense minister.   Some reports say Sharon had been asked to make more appearancesbecause Likud surveys showed many of the bloc's supporters wereleaning toward small parties of the extreme right because of thePalestinian rebellion.   Political observers say Sharon stands a fairly good chance ofbecoming defense minister. His main competition is Arens. AlthoughArens is Shamir's closest aide in the government, Shamir may prefergiving the job to Sharon to avoid stirring political discontent.   In Monday's clashes, seven Palestinians were wounded, one in theWest Bank town of Nablus and six in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospitalofficials reported.   Officials at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said a 7-year-old boywas shot in the chest and transferred in serious condition to TelAviv's Tel Hashomer hospital.   One victim in Gaza was a 6-year-old girl hit in the leg,apparently by a stray plastic bullet, according to doctors at ShifaHospital in Gaza City.</TEXT></DOC>
