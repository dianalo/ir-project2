Touchette told the IndianaSupreme Court. ``What we are saying is that the death sentence inthis case violates the 8th Amendment to the Constitution, whichprotects against cruel and unusual punishment.''   Cooper pleaded guilty to murder in 1986 for the killing of RuthElizabeth Pelke, a 78-year-old Bible teacher who was stabbed atleast 30 times with a butcher knife on May 14, 1985.   Three other teen-agers from Gary, Ind., went to trial and wereconvicted of murder in the case.   Cooper, who was 15 at the time of the crime, was accused ofmasterminding the robbery and killing Mrs. Pelke in her Gary home.She is the youngest female in the United States to be sentenced todeath.   Touchette argued that Lake Superior Court Judge James C.Kimbrough failed to consider Cooper's abusive family environment asa mitigating circumstance in the crime. If he had, the attorneyargued, it would have prohibited him from sentencing her to die inthe electric chair.   However, Gary Secrest, a deputy attorney general, said the judgedid consider Cooper's family background, her age and her cleanrecord, but found that it did not weigh heavily enough to save herfrom the death penalty.   ``It's important to remember the brutality of the crime,''Secrest said. ``It's important to remember that it was pre-plannedand pre-meditated.''   At the time of Cooper's conviction, Indiana law allowed theexecution of anyone over age 10 convicted of murder. That age limithas since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive.   Also attending the Supreme Court hearing was a delegation ofseven Italians representing the human-rights group ``Thou Shalt NotKill.''   Cooper has becoome a popular cause in Italy for opponents of thedeath penalty. Last June, members of Amnesty International submittedpetitions from nearly 2 million Italians who wanted then-Gov. RobertOrr to commute her sentence.   In Rome, about 100 protesters marched Wednesday night to theoffice of the United Nations to support Cooper's appeal. The Rev.Vito Bracone, a spokesman for the delegation that traveled toIndiana, said about 400 of his countrymen were fasting and prayingfor Cooper.   The Italian delegation planned to visit Cooper, 19, at theIndiana Women's Prison on Thursday before traveling to New York toaddress the United Nations.   ``Americans protest and pay money to save the whales, the eagles,the wolves and other creatures,'' Bracone said at a news conference.``Why don't you think it's worth it to rehabilitate a human being?''   Also speaking at the news conference was William Pelke, 41, whointroduced himself as a ``grandson of Ruth Pelke and friend of PaulaCooper.'' Pelke said he has written letters to Cooper and believesshe is remorseful for her crime.   ``I have a deep love and compassion for Paula,'' Pelke said. ``Mygrandmother was a Christian woman, and it was through her that Ilearned love, prayer and forgiveness. I know that revenge is not theanswer.''   The Supreme Court justices did not say how long it would takethem to reach a decision on the appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
