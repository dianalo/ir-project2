The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost 6.0points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,154.1, roughly midwaybetween its session low of 2,146.3 and high of 2,160.3. The keyindex moved around its closing level for much of the afternoon,although it hit the day's highs on a brief flurry of technicalbuying in early afternoon trading.   Volume was 348.4 million shares, down from 379.9 million onWednesday.   The widely circulated insider-trading rumor was tied to a reportin a Scottish newspaper that a British television network was aboutto name at least one senior government official in a report oninsider dealing. The rumor prompted speculation of furtherupheavals within the government and sent London shares lower at theoutset.   The specific focus was on Transport Minister Cecil Parkinson,who strongly denied the rumors.   The denial helped ease the market's worries, but dealers saidmore wind was taken out of London's sails by a subsequentannouncement that Ford Motor Co. reached an agreed bid of 850 pencea share, or 1.6 billion pounds, for British automaker Jaguar PLC.   The news, along with a statement from General Motors Corp.,ended most of the speculation over a bidding war for the luxuryautomaker.   Wall Street's early declines kept London under pressure for muchof the afternoon, dealers said.   ``The insider-trading rumors really kept the market at bay,'' asenior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said. ``It set thetone. But mostly people were just not too keen to rush and buy it.And they weren't too keen to sell it, either.''   The big stock feature of the day, however, was Jaguar at 30million shares traded.   The FT 30-share index settled 6.8 points lower at 1,731.3. TheFT 500-share index was down 3.72 at 1,195.09.</TEXT></DOC>
