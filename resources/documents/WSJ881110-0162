The British health-care and medical research products group said profit before tax declined to #10.8 million ($19.3 million) from #11.7 million a year earlier. Amersham said currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by about #2 million in the half, which ended Sept. 30.    &quot;We expect to make further progress in the second half of the year, but exchange rates will continue to have a significant effect on the results,&quot; said Chairman Sir Edwin Nixon. Amersham exports about 90% of its products.    Sales, which also were cut by about #2 million due to exchange-rate fluctuations, rose 8.1% to #85.8 million ($152.9 million) from #79.4 million.    The results were substantially below the worst of market expectations, and Amersham shares dropped 15 pence (27 cents) to 552 pence by midmorning.    After tax and minority payments, profit fell 5.2% to #7.3 million from #7.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
