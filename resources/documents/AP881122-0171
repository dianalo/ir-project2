However, the seven-member committee convened by the Food and DrugAdministration decided to meet again in two months to consider anyadditional evidence before making a final recommendation.   Assuming no significant new evidence surfaces during that time,the panel will renew its tentative call for three specific steps tostudy the safety of the gel implants over the next few years.   After a full day of testimony and deliberation Tuesday, thecommittee unanimously called for:   _Establishment of a national registery of women who have breastimplants so long-range studies can be carried out to determinewhether there is a heightened risk of breast cancer or other healthproblems.   _Drafting of a mandatory, standardized consent form to be signedby any prospective patient for a breast implant before the procedurecan be done.   _An FDA policy to keep physicians and the public at large awareof any new information as it develops from whatever long-rangestudies are devised.   An estimated 2 million U.S. women have had silicone gel implantsover the past two decades, including about 15 percent who used theprocedure for reconstruction of breast tissue surgically removedduring cancer treatment.   The rest simply wanted larger breasts.   The FDA has invoked a procedure whereby the gel implants willhave to undergo the type of scientific review normally associatedwith new medical devices, even though the implants were already onthe market in 1976 when Congress gave the FDA authority over suchproducts.   Since they were already on the market, implants and several otherso-called medical devices already in widespread use _ condoms areone example _ which were given ``grandfather'' approval under thelegislation.   Referring to breast implants, the FDA said earlier this month ithas decided ``there are sufficient concerns about these products tocall for pre-market approval applications. This means that in orderfor the implants to remain on the market, manufacturers will have tosupply FDA with scientific data demonstrating that they are safe andeffective.''   However, the agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving themakers of such ``grandfathered'' products time to providedocumentation for the safety of their products and said in the caseof silicone implants, ``the deadline can be no sooner than December1990.''   Meanwhile, the agency has said it will see that the labelinginformation manufacturers are required to supply doctors ``explainsadequately what is known about potential risks.''   Even though the law sets up a timetable for manufacturers tosubmit data to justify the safety and efficacy of their products,the FDA could move to remove implants under emergency procedures ifit determined there was a clear health risk.   The significance of the advisory panel's conclusion was that itsaw no need to invoke such extraordinary steps.</TEXT></DOC>
