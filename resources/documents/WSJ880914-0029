Allied rose 2 1/8 to 35 1/2 Monday, the biggest move of any of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It gave back some of that gain yesterday, falling 1/2 to 35 in an up market, amid some skepticism about its takeover prospects.    Frank Gallagher, research director at Phoenix Capital Markets, which specializes in deal stocks, says Allied doesn't seem to meet some of the characteristics Mr. Perelman cited in an interview in Monday's Wall Street Journal about possible targets.    In the interview, Mr. Perelman said he didn't want &quot;anything high-tech,&quot; or &quot;anything too capital-intensive&quot; -- both of which could describe Allied. Besides, Mr. Gallagher says, &quot;It's such a whale.&quot; With 150 million shares outstanding, Allied's current market value is $5.25 billion.    Allied is one of those hope-springs-eternal stocks whose holders might love to see a takeover. Its earnings and stock price have been largely inert for the past three years in the aftermath of the 1985 acquisition of Signal Cos.    &quot;If they were smaller, they would have been taken over long ago,&quot; says Katherine Stults, who follows multi-industry companies at Dean Witter Reynolds. &quot;It's been ugly. It's been a real dog.&quot;    Excluding nonrecurring gains and losses, this year will be the fourth in a row in which Allied's earnings will be somewhere near $3 a share. According to the Value Line Investment Survey, those results follow five years, 1980-84, in which they averaged nearly $5 a share.    Allied, a conglomerate big in aerospace, auto parts and chemicals, tried awhile back to position itself as a high-tech growth stock. No dice. At 10.8 times this year's estimates of $3.25 a share, it still sells at a slight discount to the market. The shares have declined 36% since their 1986 peak of 54 1/2.    Some shareholders have thrown in the towel. In the first quarter of this year, IDS Financial sold 350,000 shares it acquired in late 1986 and early 1987. &quot;We're concentrating on some other companies that perhaps have more clearly defined earnings growth,&quot; says Ross Stonesifer, who follows multi-industry companies at IDS.    Lately Allied Chairman Edward Hennessy, a conglomerateur out of United Technologies, has been trying to make like a cost-cutter and streamliner. He plans to restrict himself to &quot;niche&quot; acquisitions and avoid &quot;major additions to the company,&quot; Allied says. Not everyone agrees, but Ms. Stults of Dean Witter calls it &quot;a major psychological change. They're no longer interested in expanding at all costs.&quot;    Chemicals unit boss Alan Belzer was named Allied president in March with a cost-cutting mandate. Corporate staff is supposed to drop from 600 to 400 people, and the corporate research staff is falling by 100 people to 310. Together with other cuts, Allied aims to save $150 million in overhead annually by 1990.    To counter its free-spending image, Allied also has slashed its corporate aircraft fleet, the size of which topped a survey, which appeared in this column 20 months ago, on companies that owned the most aircraft.    Ms. Stults says the company also has put up for sale a luxurious estate in West Orange, N.J., called Pleasantdale Farm -- once owned by the Nichols family, who founded Allied -- that was used as a conference center. Allied says the estate has merely been &quot;mothballed.&quot;    Allied also is selling some businesses that don't fit. In the past two months, it has announced plans to sell an 80% interest in its unprofitable Bendix auto electronics group to Siemens AG of West Germany for about $250 million. And it is selling a sonar business and its stake in a Japanese brake business.    Judith Comeau, an aerospace analyst at Goldman Sachs, says these sales &quot;fulfill management's promise to improve its balance sheet and focus on core businesses and improving profitability.&quot;    But Ms. Comeau rates the stock a &quot;hold,&quot; saying she only recommends stocks she expects will significantly outperform the market. She declines to elaborate. Allied is an investment banking client of Goldman. Ms. Comeau estimates Allied will earn only $3 a share in 1988 and $3.50 next year, less than what some others expect.    Jay Harris, who follows Allied at Goldsmith andamp; Harris, an institutional research firm, doesn't recommend the stock, because he isn't sure whether it currently sells at a steep enough discount to the market price-earnings multiple.    Mr. Harris also is skeptical that Mr. Hennessy, the chairman, has changed fundamentally. &quot;Just because a guy says, 'We're going to clean house and tend to our knitting,' doesn't mean he's going to do that for the rest of his life,&quot; Mr. Harris says. He thinks Mr. Hennessy might well reach for another big acquisition if he gets the chance.    ---   Allied-Signal   (NYSE; Symbol: ALD)   Business: Aerospace, auto parts and chemicals   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Sales: $11.12 billion   Net income: $656 million; $3.90 a share   Second quarter, June 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings: 85 cents vs. 85 cents*   Average daily trading volume: 377,655 shares   Common shares outstanding: 150 million   *Year-ago profit was 64 cents a share before gain from disposal of discontinued operations. </TEXT></DOC>
