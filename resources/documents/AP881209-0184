(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a federal grand jury decides whether heshould be prosecuted, a graduate student linked to a ``virus'' thatdisrupted computers nationwide last month has been teaching hislawyer about the technical subject and turning down offers for hislife story.   Robert Morris Jr. has declined offers from movie producers, bookpublishers, magazines and television shows, said his lawyer, ThomasGuidoboni.   ``Robert is not interested,'' he said. ``He's not that kind ofperson. ... He's fairly shy and isn't looking for publicity.''   ``Until we get the potential criminal matter resolved,''Guidoboni said, the 23-year-old Cornell University graduate studentwill remain silent, despite heavy pressure to talk.   ``It's not only the media. It's computer professionals, it's thegovernment, it's Cornell. I've even heard a rumor that Congresswants to hear from him,'' said Guidoboni in an interview fromWashington, D.C.   No charges have been filed against Morris, who reportedly toldfriends that he designed the virus that temporarily clogged about6,000 university and military computers linked to the Pentagon'sArpanet network.   A virus is a rogue computer program that can duplicate itself andcripple or destroy existing computer systems.   ``The grand jury investigation is continuing. They are lookingfor specific criminal and federal violations that may have beencommitted,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter said Wednesday,declining to be more specific.   According to search warrants authorities executed at Harvard andCornell universities in the days following the Nov. 2 episode, FBIinvestigators are reviewing statutes concerning computer fraud, wirefraud, malicious mischief and unlawful access to storedcommunications.   ``But I can't say the grand jury is looking at the same thing,''said Baxter.   Recently, two Harvard University computer experts appeared beforethe grand jury in Syracuse. They were computer programmer Andrew H.Sudduth and graduate student Paul Graham.   Morris attended Harvard before beginning a doctoral program incomputer science at Cornell.   The grand jury also has heard from Dean Krafft, a Cornellcomputer science research associate, and has reviewed Morris'computer accounts from both universities.   The three witnesses have declined to say what questions the grandjury had asked or what information they provided the panel.   According to published reports, Sudduth has said Morris calledhim on the night of the outbreak to seek assistance in getting out awarning to computer operators linked to the affected system.   Morris, whose father, Robert T. Morris Sr., is the chiefscientist at the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md.,reportedly wrote the virus as an intellectual experiment and did notintend any harm.   The program apparently was intended to live undetected in theArpanet system in which it was first introduced and secretly makecopies that would move from computer to computer. However, a designerror caused it to replicate out of control in computers linked tothe system.   Morris remains secluded at his parents' home in Arnold, Md.,where he has been since the outbreak occurred.   According to his lawyer, he's ``trying to keep busy and markinghis time until this is over.''   ``He's doing volunteer work and spending a lot of time with me,teaching an ignorant lawyer about a highly technical matter,'' saidGuidoboni.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Dec. 12</NOTE></DOC>
