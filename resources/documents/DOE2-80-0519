<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0519 </DOCNO><TEXT>An empirical method developed by the author for predicting thermal expansivitiesfor hard materials to about +- 10%, is extended to relatively softermaterials - phosphides, sulphides, and selenides. To avoid the complexityof different structures, a common structure, the NaCl-type structure,has been maintained in carrying out the study. Thermal expansivity iscorrelated with two parameters: the atomization energy of the solid,which is taken as a measure of bonding strength; and the Knoop microhardness,which is taken as a measure of the steepness of the extension side ofthe potential energy well. An equation for the volume thermal expansivityis given. Included also is an evaluation of the thermodynamic stabilitiesof ThP and UP.</TEXT></DOC>
