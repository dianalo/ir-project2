Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, said he has beenan opponent of the conservative North Carolina Republican since hefirst heard Helms while studying at the University of NorthCarolina in the 1960s.   ``I have detested him since I was 19, and moreover I think hewon against Harvey Gantt on a blatantly racist campaign. Period.It's true,'' Wellstone said at a news conference Thursday. Helmswon re-election last week by narrowly defeating Gantt, a black.   ``I didn't come here to Washington to start talking differentlythan I did in Minnesota.''   Wellstone could be serving on at least one committee with Helms,a possibility that Wellstone acknowledged would be ``interesting.''   One of Wellstone's top priorities is a seat on the AgricultureCommittee. Helms is the panel's former chairman and now its No. 2Republican.   ``I think people in Minnesota expect me to come to the UnitedStates Senate and every single time it's appropriate on the floorof the Senate or wherever to take on Jesse Helms and present a verydifferent kind of vision of politics,'' Wellstone said.   Helms, who has never met Wellstone, responded Thursday: ``I hopethat he will prove to be somewhat more stable. ... Otherwise he'sgoing to have a difficult time in the Senate.''   Helms bristled at Wellstone remarks that Helms had ``minimized''the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. ``He went off thedeep end,'' Helms said of Wellstone.</TEXT></DOC>
