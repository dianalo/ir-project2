The concrete-and-steel maze of New York City contains manycolorful patches tended by people like Ms. Rainey, who garden tosoften the edge of city living.   Urban children who didn't know where tomatoes came from aredazzled by the plots, and tourists from around the world includethem on their itineraries.   A group of gardeners called the Green Guerrillas began themovement to make the city greener in 1972 by cleaning out emptylots piled with trash and planting shrubs and flowers. The citybecame involved in 1979 when it began Operation GreenThumb to helppay for fencing, seeds and tools.   Today, nearly 550 community gardens can be found on lots ownedby the city, and GreenThumb says the value of the fruit andvegetables they yield amounts to $375,000 a year. There also aremany gardens on private lots.   Gardens give people greater pride in their neighborhoods, saidLisa Stephano, a spokeswoman for the American Community GardenAssociation, based in Philadelphia. The national association claims250 community garden programs nationwide as members, but estimatesthere are nearly 1,000.   ``We find that once a garden is developed, it takes overpeople's lives,'' said Jane Weissman, director of OperationGreenThumb. ``What they are really doing is throwing open theirdoors, going down in their streets, meeting their neighbors andcreating an environment of safety with others.''   Three years ago, John English was a jeweler on Wall Street.Today, he owns a construction company he founded to stop a cityplan to pave over what is considered the city's first communitygarden.   English, 47, couldn't understand how developers' plans to widenthe sidewalk and put in shops and low- and middle-income housingwould improve the neighborhood more than the Liz Christy Garden. Hebecame an expert on housing to argue his case that the gardenshould stay and that the homes should be built elsewhere.   English won, and the graceful garden still gives the feel of thebackyard of a country estate. Only it's on Houston Street, a mainthoroughfare pounded day and night by trucks and cabs.   ``A garden is part of the soul. Without the cycles of life, oneloses track of reality,'' he said. ``So to me, this is real in acity which is surreal.''   The noise of clattering trucks fades in the tranquility of thegarden, but the syringes and other trash tossed over the fence area reminder of the mean streets outside.   All of the city-sponsored gardens must be opened to the publicat least once a week, and on a recent evening passers-by strolledamong the peach, apricot and plum trees while some of English'semployees barbecued lobster and corn and drank beer.   ``This is my yard,'' he said.   Teresa Civello, a neighborhood resident, calls the garden ``apiece of heaven.''   ``I walk by every morning and here, in the middle of thisdesolate, miserable neighborhood, there is a little bit of hope,''she said. ``It's always exciting and full of mystery.''   The Green Guerrillas have a paid staff of four and 250volunteers who share their technical expertise to help start newgardens.   The group helped Ms. Rainey landscape her garden in a lot thathad been a neighborhood dumping ground, full of discardedappliances, trash and bricks from crumbled buildings. Now, thereare plots of greens, okra, string beans, cabbage and tomatoes,surounded by zinnias, gladioluses and wild grass.   Ms. Rainey, 61, has lived only in Miami and New York City. Shesaid she had to sit down in the dirt and get acquainted with it.   Her friends see the garden as a neighborhood improvementproject, she said.   ``Even the crackheads haven't bothered me,'' she said. ``Theycome by and say, `Gert, it's looking good.'   ``They sort of protect it. They wouldn't take so much as atomato.''   But plant rustling is on the rise in the city, and many,including GreenThumb's Ms. Weissman, blame addicts who sell flowersand shrubs on the streets for fast cash. Landscapers also aresuspected of stealing plants. Some gardeners have begun chainingbushes and anchoring trees to buried cinder blocks.   Over in the Bronx, Geneva McFadden heard about OperationGreenThumb about four years ago and, in one day, rounded up eightneighbors she had never met and received approval for a garden fromthe community board.   They turned a lot that had been piled with burned-out cars andtrash into an idyllic patch in a noisy neighborhood of apartmentbuildings and mini-markets.   The garden is a mix of meticulous brick-lined flower beds ofroses, geraniums, petunias, marigolds and pink clover, andwood-framed vegetable plots thick with healthy tomato plants,cabbage and corn.   ``People stop and comment _ white, black and Spanish _ so itbrings the neighborhood together,'' said Mrs. McFadden, 75, whogrew up on a farm in South Carolina. ``The kids stand therelooking. A lot of them have never seen flowers grow before.''   Thousands of people walk by Randy Glaser's garden in GreenwichVillage each day to gaze through the chain-link fence at elegantrosebushes, climbing trellises, neat vegetable plots and beds ofJohnny-jump-ups, delphinium and fire lillies.   Many of the admirers are drawn as they leave a supermarket justfeet away.   ``People are constantly stopping, asking questions, saying thankyou for the garden,'' Glaser said. ``They almost become poets _some call it an oasis in a cement desert; some say they've changedstores just to come by here.''   ``It's like I've reunited with the earth, the world,'' Ms.Rainey said recently as she sat under in the shade of a tree,smoking a cigarette.   ``You look out the window and see vacant buildings, homelesspeople on TV, our children destroyed by drugs,'' she said. ``It'sall like a big sore festering and the garden takes your mind offthat.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, Aug. 14</NOTE></DOC>
