In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, when stocks were down generally, Newmont slumped $13, closing at $45.625, on volume of 1.4 million shares.    Thursday, a Delaware Chancery court judge rejected Ivanhoe's effort to block Consolidated Gold Fields PLC's purchase of New York-based Newmont shares last month. The judge also refused to bar Gold Fields from voting the shares. The purchases were intended to thwart the bid for Newmont by Ivanhoe, an investor group led by Texas oil investor T. Boone Pickens Jr.    Ivanhoe, which owns 9.95% of Newmont, contended the purchases, made in &quot;Street sweeps&quot; over two days last month, illegally &quot;locked out&quot; the possibility of an Ivanhoe tender offer.    London-based Gold Fields' recent purchase of 15.8 million Newmont shares in the open market boosted its stake in the mining company to about 49.7%. Newmont has a total of 66 million shares outstanding. Gold Fields owned 26.2% of Newmont prior to the purchase. Newmont amended an earlier standstill agreement with Gold Fields, permitting it to increase its position to 49.9%.    Ivanhoe said that pending its appeal, it will seek an order maintaining a temporary restraining order that prevented Gold Fields from voting the 15.8 million Newmont shares. </TEXT></DOC>
