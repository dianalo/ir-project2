The volatiles are released in a matter of millisecondsand, if allowed to react with background steam over tens of milliseconds,they reach an equilibrium condition with the products consisting primarilyof carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water. Rapid pyrolysisreactions will likely find application in indirect processes. Such processes(e.g., the synthesis of methanol from syngas) generally operate at pressuresof 30 to 35 atmospheres, and it is recognized that operation of the gasificationsection of the plant at elevated pressures would save downstream compressioncosts. High-heating-rate, high-temperature (1600-2400 K) devolatilizationexperiments are carried out in a 10 liter batch reactor which servesto pyrolyze a suspension of pulverized coal in a mixture of steam andnitrogen. The high heating rate of coal particles is achieved by ignitinga stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in nitrogen diluent.A rapid quench sampling system, designed to accept gas and particle samplefrom the reactor interior for a short interval (4 ms), at a prescribedtime after initiation of reaction, is used to obtain transient reactiondata. At 2400 K, steam to carbon molar ratio of 2 and reaction timesgreater than 100 ms, an increase in pressure from 4 bar to 45 bar isfound to have a small positive effect on the coal carbon conversion.The yields of carbon monoxide and hydrogen increase correspondingly.The carbon dioxide yield is independent of pressure. From economic considerationsthese results are of direct importance as an increase in pressure increasesthe yields of desirable products (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), withoutaffecting the yield of the undesirable product (carbon dioxide). 11 refs.,11 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
