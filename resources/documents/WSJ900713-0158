Schlesinger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   NIPNY J.SRP J.FUT JAPAN</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- Personal computer viruses, virtually unheard of afew years ago in Japan, are spreading here, government andindustry officials fear.   NEC Corp., Japan's largest PC maker, announced this weekthat an unspecified number of its flagship 9800-series modelsare infected with a &quot;Christmas&quot; virus that can wipe outcertain large application programs when the computer'scalendar reaches Dec. 25.</LP><TEXT>   In April, Sharp Corp. said a game program compatible withits X-68000 PC was infected with a virus, and press reportssaid about half the 3,000 programs sold were tainted. In May,Fujitsu Ltd. discovered a virus in 20 on-site computers thatwould become active on any Friday the 13th.   &quot;Those three cases may be a warning,&quot; said Shinjuro Ogino,director of the software technology center of thegovernment-affiliated Information-Technology PromotionAgency. &quot;I'm afraid there will be an increase of computerviruses for Japanese personal computers.&quot;   Japan has lagged far behind other developed nations inpersonal computer use, but sales are now taking off, and withthe growing popularity may come growing computer crime.   An agency survey of nearly 400 Japanese companies reportedonly one virus complaint in 1986, two in 1987, and seven in1988. But the survey showed 30 complaints in 1989, and six inthe first three months of 1990. Mr. Ogino said most of thosecases involved machines imported from the U.S., where virusesare far more common. He said he worried that the recentviruses may have targeted Japanese machines specifically.   Fujitsu and NEC said the cases announced this year werethe most serious they had ever found.   In the NEC virus, when the computer's calendar turns toDec. 25, the words &quot;A Merry Christmas to You]&quot; appear on thescreen, and applications larger than 30,720 bytes aredestroyed.   Sharp discovered two similar viruses in programs for thecomputer game Farside Moon for its machines. One strain,designed to turn on once a month beginning this month, issupposed to destroy data on the floppy disk and could alsodamage the machine's components, according to Japanese pressreports.   The Fujitsu virus gradually expands to fill the computer'smemory and prevent the PC's use. On a Friday the 13th, whichoccurs this week, the application program is destroyed.   Spokesmen for Fujitsu and NEC said no damage had beendone. A Sharp spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.   &quot;Software delivered by the software vendors ormanufacuters is okay,&quot; said a Fujitsu spokesman, but&quot;software is becoming more popular to share among colleauges,so there's more possibility that the virus move from one PCto another PC.&quot;   But an official in the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry who is following the issue said the number ofreported cases may be increasing simply because of greaterawareness. &quot;I think in past days, people regarded sometrouble as bugs and not as a virus.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
