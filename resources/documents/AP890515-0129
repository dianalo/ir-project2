The company and scientists that developed the solution say itwill allow more of these organs to be transplanted and give doctorsmore time to find the best match for recipients, ensuring greaterchances the patient will survive.   While previously livers had to be transplanted within 10 hoursand pancreases within eight hours of being removed from a donor,livers preserved in Du Pont's solution can be kept alive for morethan 30 hours and pancreases up to 28 hours, said Dr. FolkertBelzer of the University of Wisconsin.   The solution also can preserve kidneys for up to 40 hours, thesame amount of time as conventional methods, said Belzer, aprofessor of surgery, who led the team of University of Wisconsinresearchers who developed the solution.   The new preservative, tested in clinical trials at hospitals andtransplant centers throughout the country, ``has now allowed us thesame safe preservation time for the liver and the pancreas whichwas previously only available for the kidney,'' Belzer said at anews conference with Du Pont officials.   The result, he said, is that transplantations of these organsdon't require the haste and urgency previously needed. Thisimproves the safety of the transplant surgery since it can bescheduled with a full, well-rested staff, and assures betterfunctioning organs after transplant.   The result is better post-operative recovery, which reduceshospital time for the patient and lowers the overall cost of theoperation, Belzer said.   The average hospital stay previously was six weeks for liver andpancreas transplant patients, but Belzer's solution reduced that toabout 20 days, including one or two days in intensive care, he said.   Also, longer preservation time allows patients to wait at home,sometimes more than 1,000 miles from a transplant center, for adonor to be found, instead of having to relocate temporarily, oftenfar away from their families, to an area near a center.   Though officials say there remains a critical shortage of organsfor transplant, extending the time they can be preserved willensure that fewer are ``wasted,'' said Joseph Mollica, vicepresident of Du Pont Pharmaceuticals.   Last year, 9,123 kidney transplants, 1,680 liver transplants and243 pancreas transplants were performed in the United States,according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, based inRichmond, Va.   However, about 14,850 people are currently waiting for kidneytransplants, 738 are waiting for liver transplants and 223 peopleare waiting pancreas transplants, according to the network.   The preservative was developed with financing by the NationalInstitutes of Health and Du Pont. It will be available on acommercial basis beginning June 1, company officials said.   Researchers also are testing to determine whether the solutionor a modification of it can extend the life of hearts and lungs fortransplant.</TEXT></DOC>
