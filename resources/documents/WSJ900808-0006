In a similar reversal of policy, the president ofVenezuela, after meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle,agreed to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day tohelp make up the four million-barrel shortfall caused by theinterruption of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports.</LP><TEXT>   Petroleum prices, meanwhile, rose sharply again lateyesterday on worries that world supplies may be crimped soonby new developments in the Mideast crisis.   Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmarkcrude, jumped as much as $1.50 a barrel in late tradingfollowing news of a multinational military force, includingU.S. troops, being sent to Saudi Arabia to protect it fromIraq. Prior to the news, which came as most oil markets wereclosing, the rate of price increases had slowed sharply, withsome crudes rising only pennies a barrel after recent $2 to$4 daily jumps.   There was new evidence, meanwhile, that global sanctionsagainst Iraq for invading and occupying Kuwait are beginningto cut deeply into its oil exports. Turkey barred tankersfrom loading from a second Iraqi pipeline to theMediterranean. Earlier, Iraq had closed the other linethrough Turkey because of a lack of customers.   Also, according to oil industry experts, Iraq's use ofanother pipeline, which crosses Saudi Arabia, had beensharply reduced. Apparently, the storage is full at the RedSea export terminal used by Iraq as tankers, operating underthe sanctions, sail away empty.   Until last month, when the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries moved to tighten supplies to boostthen-depressed oil prices, there was much talk of a world oilglut. Although fuel inventories were considered to be aboutat normal levels, those for crude oil were generally thoughtto be much too high.   Only a week ago Energy Security Analysis Inc., whichtracks oil supplies world-wide, had estimated that therestill was a surplus of 100 million barrels in globalinventories of crude oil. But that was before Iraq's invasionof Kuwait last Thursday.   Prior to the disclosures about Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,John Redpath, a market analyst for the Washington-based firm,said, &quot;With four million barrels a day out of the market, itwill take only a month to work that off.&quot;   Contributing to the evidence that the crude oil glut mayalready be drying up was the latest weekly report on U.S.petroleum statistics by the American Petroleum Institute.Released as usual after futures markets had closed yesterday,the latest API report showed that U.S. crude inventories,although still higher than normal at 379.7 million barrels,were drawn down last week by some seven million barrels.   The potential shrinking of petroleum inventories comes ontop of what John Sauer, chief energy economist of ConocoInc., labels the &quot;fairly limited production capability&quot; thatcould be called upon to replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes inworld oil markets. &quot;If we take a look at the requirements,&quot;Mr. Sauer told a small group of reporters yesterday, &quot;wethink the world would like to buy about 23.5 million barrelsa day of OPEC oil.&quot;   But if the Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports are eliminatedcompletely, Mr. Sauer said supplies could total three millionbarrels a day less than desired.   While several countries could produce more oil, much ofthe additional capacity is in the Persian Gulf region and inthe range of Iraq's guns. Most experts consider that all fourmillion barrels a day of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports could besupplanted with added output from other OPEC countries.&quot;There is spare capacity to produce that oil if there weresome form of international consensus to do so,&quot; CambridgeEnergy Research Associates officials reported.   Saudi Arabia, which apparently hadn't yet pledged to aspecific figure for increased production, has been producing5.4 million barrels a day and has a daily output capacity of7.5 million barrels, according to studies by PetroleumFinance Co. The Bush administration has been seeking acommitment for increased output of about two million barrelsa day.   Industry officials noted that the United Arab Emirates hadbeen producing as much as 2.2 million barrels a day before itwas brought back into the OPEC fold with a quota of 1.5million last month. It could produce 600,000 to 700,000barrels a day more. Libya could increase output by 300,000barrels, although it supports Iraq, and Nigeria and otherscould add as much.   Although most OPEC oil ministers continued to maintain inpublic that they are going to stick to the quotas agreed toat their late July meeting, there were reports that theUnited Arab Emirates also might be willing to boost outputwith the protection of the new military forces.   Still, many in the oil industry expect oil prices tocontinue rising -- with some fallbacks -- until the MiddleEast confrontation with Iraq is over, or until demanddeclines. Some now project prices might go as high as $45 abarrel. In U.S. futures trading yesterday, crude forSeptember delivery settled at $28.31 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
