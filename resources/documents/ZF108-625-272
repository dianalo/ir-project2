C.andP;  The program is intended tofacilitate research and development on quality computer applications.andP;  Amajor interest is computing that directly benefits society and social groupswith special needs such as disabilities, addictions or very low income.andP;  Theconference will also address the social impact of computerization in bothwork and nonwork places with particular attention to the risks and benefitsof information systems.andM;Tutorials and workshops will be offered on such topics as: assessing qualityof computing and information systems; software risk assessment;computerization in the workplace; computing in the home and school; computingfor improving human services; computing for national and world problems;computing technology for the physically impaired; prevention of computercrime; evaluation of MIS systems; computer ethics, politics and human values;and quality education and computing.andM;For information and registration forms, call: (202) 994-7238.andM;SIGDA (Design Automation) is sponsoring a scholarship program for Bay Areahigh school seniors from underrepresented groups in engineering (Blacks,Hispanics, American Indians, women and the disabled), who wish to pursuecarreers in computer science or electrical engineering.andP;  Two students will beawarded $4000; renewable scholarships and two recipients will receiveone-time awards of $1000.andM;In addition to the scholarship, SIGDA will pair scolarship recipient with amentor, who will provide encouragement and assistance, where possible, duringthe student's college career and act as a role model for the student and helphim/her understand more about their chosen career.andM;For information on becoming a a mentor, contact: Charlotte Acken, ScholarshipProgram administrator, (415)294-3248;e-mail: cacken@sandia.llnl.gov.andM;SIGFORTH (Forth Programming Languages) is looking for individuals interestedin working with other professionals in developing curricula for the Forthlanguage in a number of disciplines, including computer science, mathematicsand computer engineering.andP;  The group plans on meeting at the CSC conferencenext February.andP;  If interested in the training of future Forth languagestudents, please contact: Tom Hand at (407) 729-5913.andM;SIGGRAPH (Computer Graphics) Video Reviews are being shown as part of a newexhibition at the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.andP;  Theexhibit, called &quot;The Information Age,&quot; examines how people's relationshipswith information and information technology have affected all aspects of ourlives.andM;To order SIGGRAPH Video Reviews, contact SVR Order Department, c/o FirstPriority, P.O.Box576,Itasca,IL601430576; (800) 523-5503; outside the U.S.:andO;(708) 250-0807.andM;SIGPLAN (Programming Languages) has funded a proposal for a new archivalpublication, tentatively called Letters on Programming Languages and Systemsthat is before ACM's Publications Board.andP;  Charlie Fischer of the Universityof Wisconsin has been named editor of this rapid-publication journal.andP;  Hewill be seeking short, pointed papers for the early issues, as well asprompt, incisive referees to assure ACM's high standards.andP;  He can receivecommunications through e-mail: fisher@cs.wise.edu.andM;SIGSAC (Security, Audit and Control) is sponsoring a Student Paper Contest toincrease awareness of security, audit, control and ethics as they apply tothe computing field.andP;  The competition will produce a number of papers forpublication in the ACM SIGSAC Quarterly Review and presentation at SIGSACconferences.andM;Papers my be submitted to: Harold Highland, chairman of the Student PaperCompetition, 562 Croydon Road, Elmont, NY 11003; (516) 775-1313.andM;Winners will be announced at CSC '91, to be held March 5-7, in San Aantonio,TX.andM;SIGSAM (Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) is joining with SIGNUM(NumericalMathematics) in formulating ways to foster cooperation and interchangebetween the two disciplines.andP;  One proposal under consideration is a jointSIGSAM/SIGNUM conference.andM;&quot;It is increasingly important to think of scientific computing asencompassing numeric, symbolic, graphic and other appropriate activities.andO;Advances in hardware, operating environments, and networking demand systemintergration,&quot; according to Paul Wang, chairman of SIGSAM.andM;Any comments and suggestions should be directed to: Paul Wang, Department ofMath and Computer Science, KentState University, Kent, OH 44242-0001; e-mail:pwang@math-cs.kent.edu.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
