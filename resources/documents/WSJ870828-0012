Robert D. Grey of Chatsworth, Calif., was led in handcuffs from the offices of Lion's Gate Studios, the New World unit, after returning from vacation, according to an eyewitness.    Mr. Grey, who was released on bail, was the Lion's Gate comptroller. Harry Evans Sloan, co-chairman of New World, said the company brought concerns about Mr. Grey to the attention of police, and later the 40-year-old executive was dismissed.    Reached by telephone, Mr. Grey declined to comment on the charges.    Larry Diamond, an attorney with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, said Mr. Grey was charged with one count of grand theft by embezzlement for crimes that allegedly occurred between last Nov. 19 and June 10.    Mr. Grey also was charged with five counts of forgery, Mr. Diamond said. The prosecutor said authorities believe Mr. Grey gained about $160,000 by wrongful means.    New World acquired Lion's Gate Studios in May 1986, and uses Lion's Gate for movie and television post-production work. New World also leases the facility to other entertainment companies.    The specific forgery charges against Mr. Grey involve five checks, each for about $9,500, that allegedly were forged between April and August this year. Mr. Grey also was charged with theft by embezzlement exceeding $100,000.    New World, which makes films and TV shows and publishes comic books, is in the midst of a battle to acquire Kenner Parker Toys Inc. Earlier this month, New World sweetened its tender offer to $47 a share, or $493.1 million, for the 91.6% of the Beverly, Mass.-based toy maker that it doesn't already own.    Separately, Kenner Parker said that the U.S. Court of Appeals denied New World's request for an injunction against enforcement of a Massachusetts law under which its tender offer for Kenner Parker has been blocked. Arguments on the state anti-takeover law are expected to be heard next week in state court.    In 1986, New World had net income of $10.7 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of $188.9 million. Yesterday in American Stock Exchange composite trading, New World common closed at $9.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
