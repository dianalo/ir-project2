SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> I BAC WFCTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   First Interstate Bancorp asked the Federal Reserve Board to clear its unsolicited bid to acquire BankAmerica Corp., and threatened to launch a hostile tender offer at slightly lower terms than its latest bid.    The Fed application is considered an unusual effort to further pressure BankAmerica's board into considering First Interstate's previously reported bid. The Los Angeles-based bank holding company is valuing its bid at $22 for each of BankAmerica's 154 million shares outstanding. On two occasions in the past five weeks, directors of the troubled San Francisco banking giant have refused to consider the bid, indicating a resolve to remain independent.    In the application, First Interstate also said it committed itself to raising some $550 million in primary capital before any merger was completed. The capital plan is an apparent effort to alleviate the concerns of some industry analysts and possibly regulators themselves that First Interstate's bid is long on paper but short on actual cash to cover future loan losses.    First Interstate's Fed filing wasn't immediately available, although the company said it would &quot;accommodate either a negotiated or a non-negotiated merger transaction.&quot;    In Washington, a Fed spokesman declined to comment on the filing as a matter of policy. The Fed typically disposes of such filings in 90 days, although the spokesman said the process can extend much longer in &quot;very complex cases,&quot; presumably including First Interstate's four-volume filing.    A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;We very much regret that First Interstate refuses to wait until we complete the comprehensive analysis of our business strategies that is now under way.&quot; He added that &quot;our board has said it will give due consideration to the First Interstate proposal when BankAmerica's new management team has completed its analysis. Despite the pressures being brought by First Interstate to force the issue, that position hasn't changed.&quot;    First Interstate indicated that it still would prefer to strike a friendly accord with BankAmerica. But, for the first time, it openly stated its willingness to appeal directly to BankAmerica's shareholders through a tender offer.    In the next 10 days, the company said it would register with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a package of securities currently valued at about $21 a share, which it would offer to exchange for each of BankAmerica's shares. First Interstate didn't say whether or when it would proceed with the offer, which is $1 less than its earlier bid.    The $21-a-share exchange offer would include 0.23 share of First Interstate common, $4 stated value of First Interstate preferred and $4.45 face amount of First Interstate primary capital debentures, for each BankAmerica common share. First Interstate valued the offer at $3.23 billion, compared with a total $3.39 billion under the $22 bid, which includes 0.22 share of common, a $3 capital debenture and a $7 preferred share for each BankAmerica share.    First Interstate said an exchange offer would be subject to several conditions. These include the tendering of at least a majority of BankAmerica's shares, backing from First Interstate's shareholders, verification of BankAmerica's published financial statements and regulatory approvals.    In the application, First Interstate said the planned $550 million capital infusion for the merged companies would consist of $150 million of common stock, $150 million of perpetual preferred stock and $250 million of primary capital debt securities.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First Interstate closed at $54.25 a share, down 25 cents; BankAmerica closed at $14.625 a share, unchanged.    Separately, BankAmerica agreed as part of a restructuring to sell Bank of America's consumer trust line to the Wells Fargo Bank unit of Wells Fargo andamp; Co., another San Francisco banking concern, for $100 million.    Analysts said the price was a premium, considering the unit's marginal earnings. The unit and related services administer $11.1 billion of consumer assets and 12,400 accounts. Annual fee revenue totals $51 million. Sale of the unit -- which is carried on the books at about $2 million -- is expected to be completed in the first quarter and to result in a $95 million gain. </TEXT></DOC>
