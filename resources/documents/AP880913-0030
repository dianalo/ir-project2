In Wisconsin, Democrat William Proxmire's decision to retireafter 31 years in the Senate enticed four members of his party intothe race, including former Gov. Anthony S. Earl, who lost are-election bid two years ago. Earl appeared to be the front-runneruntil the entry of Milwaukee Bucks basketball team owner HerbertKohl, who spent $2.1 million, much of it his own money, on TV ads.   A poll published by the Milwaukee Journal on Sunday showed Kohlpreferred by 43 percent of the voters, Earl by 40 percent, EdwardR. Garvey, an unsuccessful Senate candidate in 1986, by 8 percent,Secretary of State Douglas J. La Follette 5 percent, and 4 percentundecided. The poll had a margin of error of 6 percent.   The heavy spending by Kohl became a major campaign issue,especially since Proxmire spent just $145.10 in his last race.   La Follette, who reported spending $15,536, ran a radiocommercial that began with the sound of a toilet flushing, his wayof saying that a Wisconsin tradition of personal campaigning wasgoing down the drain.   A Garvey commercial showed a Frankenstein monster with atelevision on its shoulders and a Kohl ad on the screen. In thebackground, film clips from horror movies showed citizens fleeingin terror.   The Republican field was smaller but the fighting was just asintense, with Senate Minority Leader Susan Engeleiter pittedagainst former state party chairman Stephen B. King. Engeleiterlabeled King an ultraconservative, while he condemned her as aliberal and also questioned whether she could campaign for and holdan office like the Senate while also taking care of two smallchildren.   In the Journal poll, Engeleiter held a 61 percent to 30 percentlead.   Motherhood also became an issue in New Hampshire, where formerstate legislator Betty Tamposi and former state Supreme CourtJustice Charles Douglas are the front-runners in a six-way GOP racefor the nomination to succeed Republican Rep. Judd Gregg.   Last week, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a Douglas supporter, saidTamposi should stay home and care for her toddler daughter.Humphrey apologized for his ``dumb'' remark after it was roundlydenounced and deplored by virtually everyone.   Gregg gave up his seat to run for governor after Republicanincumbent John Sununu announced he was retiring. Gregg is heavilyfavored in the GOP primary against Robert Shaw, a former Manchestermayor, and political unknown William Lawrence. The winner will faceDemocratic lawyer Paul McEachern, a staunch opponent of theSeabrook nuclear power plant who narrowly lost Sununu in 1986.   In neighboring Vermont, another longtime Republican congressmanis giving up his seat to run for higher office _ Jim Jeffords, whois seeking the nomination to replace retiring Republican Sen.Robert Stafford.   Jeffords, as popular with Democrats as with Republicans, isfavored in a primary over Michael Griffes, a former Grumman Corp.employee. Griffes has attacked Jeffords' independence _ which in1987 earned him the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record of anyHouse Republican as analyzed by Congressional Quarterly magazine.   Former GOP Gov. Richard Snelling donated $1,000 to the Griffescampaign, but declined to endorse Griffes, saying the 35-year-oldpolitical newcomer had not ``sufficiently established hiscredentials.''   The winner of the race will face Democrat William Gray, a formerU.S. attorney.   In Arizona, the main focus has been on state legislative racesin which a number of GOP candidates are ultraconservative backersof ousted Gov. Evan Mecham. In some cases, they are challengingRepublican lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict Mecham forobstructing justice and misusing funds.   After his removal, Mecham predicted ``a revolution at the ballotbox.'' But he insists that those who keep talking about the Mechamfactor are ``trying to divert the attention of the voters'' fromthe real issue _ record tax and spending increases that were passedafter his departure to bail the state out of a deficit.   The two other states holding primaries today are Minnesota,where voters are expected to nominate Republican Sen. DavidDurenberger for a third term and give Democratic Attorney GeneralHubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III the right to challenge him, andUtah, which has just one contested congressional race.</TEXT></DOC>
