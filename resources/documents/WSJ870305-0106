This was a wonderful gift to the American economy, contributing to a 1986 inflation rate of only 1.1% -- the lowest in a quarter-century. In January, however, inflation was back up near double digits, and the recent rebound in oil prices was largely to blame.    From almost any economic perspective, except that of oil-well owners, $10 oil is better than $25 oil. The U.S. is a net oil importer. The less money we have to send abroad for a barrel of oil, the better off we are. But even if all the oil we used were domestic, a lower price would be better than a higher price.    As explained in the greatest economics treatise ever written by an American -- Henry George's &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1879) -- money diverted to pay for the use of natural resources is like a dead weight or tax on the productive factors in the economy, capital and labor. For those who find Henry George too eccentric, a straightforward capitalist analysis will do: The most efficient price for anything is the price set by competition in the free market. Twenty-five dollars was the price set by a cartel, OPEC; $10 was the market price after the cartel collapsed.    This is all so obvious that it seems hardly worth saying, except that -- incredibly -- it has been the all-but-official policy of the Reagan administration to promote higher oil prices through the revival of OPEC. In December the OPEC nations agreed to a 7% production cut, aimed at &quot;stabilizing&quot; prices at $18 a barrel. It worked for a while, though lately cheating has eroded prices a bit, and whether the attempt will succeed remains uncertain. My colleague Fred Barnes reported recently in The New Republic that the administration has a &quot;target&quot; of oil priced at $20 a barrel. To that end, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has been making speeches around the country about the danger of cheap oil, signaling to OPEC that the administration is on their side.    Suppose the administration meets its &quot;target.&quot; The difference between $10 oil and $20 oil is an added burden of about $60 billion a year on American producers and consumers, a third to a half of which goes abroad. To be sure, some Americans benefit, and some of the money sent abroad comes back through exports. But overall, it's a stiff loss for the economy.    Meanwhile the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer at 4.3 billion barrels a year, suddenly enjoys a $43 billion kick in its gross national product, much of it in the form of badly needed foreign exchange. In the Third World, there is some relief for oil-producing nations that squandered their blessings, but the very poorest nations are driven down even further. Africa's oil bill goes up $6 billion -- about six times our foreign aid to that continent.    And for what? The great bogey-word is &quot;dependency.&quot; It's certainly true that low oil prices will lead to increased imports, since the marginal cost of production is so much lower abroad. But what, exactly, is wrong with &quot;dependency&quot; on foreign oil? The argument has two strands.    First, it's said that dependency, caused by lower prices, will enable OPEC to raise prices again. It's true that the proper goal is low oil prices in the long run, not the short run, and you can't say for sure that today's bargain won't lead to tomorrow's rip-off. What you can say for sure is that the interests of oil users and oil suppliers are directly contradictory on this question. If low prices now will surely lead to higher prices later, why is OPEC trying so hard to raise prices now? They know their own interests better than we do, I suspect.    Second, there's &quot;national security&quot; -- always the last refuge of the protectionist. We need to know we'll have oil when we need it, and can't be blackmailed. But is this insurance policy worth $60 billion a year? For $60 billion, we could buy an extra year's worth of $10 oil every year to save for that rainy day. Indeed, since oil is a finite resource, &quot;national security&quot; would suggest that it makes more sense to use foreign oil today and hoard our own supplies.    The oil industry is just aching for an import fee to raise domestic prices. Trouble is, having spent the 1970s whining about government meddling with oil prices, industry spokesmen are comically unable to say the words. Charles DiBona, head of the American Petroleum Institute, calls for an &quot;immediate national dialogue&quot; in which &quot;no option should be ruled out,&quot; and so on. Oil-state politicians have gotten the point, and are promoting various schemes for minimum oil prices in the $20-and-up range. An oil import fee, like any tariff, would cost consumers more than it benefits domestic producers and would destroy more jobs than it creates. It is, in effect, a tax of which about a third goes to the government and two-thirds to owners of domestic oil -- hardly an impoverished group, even at $10 a barrel.    This doesn't mean we should stand by and do nothing -- let alone give an approving wink -- as OPEC attempts to regroup. The final destruction of the cartel would do more for our prosperity and our national security than almost anything President Reagan might achieve during the remainder of his term. And now is the moment to strike, as the latest revival attempt flounders. Here's what needs to be done:    First, we must send a clear message that cartel market manipulation is against American policy and regarded as an unfriendly act by the U.S. government. No one believes that today. Perhaps OPEC officials should be told they risk arrest if they try to enter the U.S. After all, their behavior is flagrantly criminal under our antitrust laws.    Second, we need a broad-based energy tax -- not an oil-import fee -- to reduce domestic consumption without giving an unjustified windfall to domestic producers.    Third, we need to counter any OPEC production restrictions by dumping oil on the market from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. OPEC's December plan was to cut production to 15.8 million barrels from 18.5 million. Just 2.7 million barrels a day from the SPR, which currently contains 500 million, would defeat this effort. And if our resolve were clear, cheating by OPEC members themselves would do the dirty work for us after a few days.    Why has the Reagan administration done nothing to prevent the renewed oil-price gouge? Partly out of complacency. Oil prices have almost doubled in the past year, but they're still lower than they used to be. Partly as a shameless sacrifice of its own capitalist principles to the political demands of the oil states. And partly, of course, because of the president's no-tax pledge.    The result of this pledge, combined with the administration's semi-official commitment to expensive oil, is truly insane. Rather than allowing extra money to enter the Treasury in Washington, Reagan and company are helping to enrich the treasuries of Riyadh, Tripoli and Moscow.    ---   Mr. Kinsley edits The New Republic. </TEXT></DOC>
