Ventres, Borden's chairman and chiefexecutive officer. He added that he believed banks and investmenthouses would be reluctant to loan money or raise funds for such araider.   Ventres said the New York-based company knew of no takeoverattempt, and that Borden already has a poison pill plan designed tofend off an unwanted suitor.   Instead, he told reporters at a news conference, the new plan wasdevised to ensure that if such an attempt were made, Bordenstockholders would receive what the company considers a fair price.   To determine that price, the company first would calculate itsvalue through traditional methods, such as analyzing cash flow andmarket share. To that figure would be added at least half of the``strategic'' value that a raider could obtain by breaking up thecompany, consolidating production and other efficiencies obtainedafter takeovers, he said.   An alternate way of determining ``fair'' value would be if thetakeover offer would result in the cash purchase of 85 percent ofBorden's ``disinterested'' shares _ those not already held by thepurchaser, Borden's directors or top management.   If a raider failed to meet either one of those tests, the``people plan'' would go into effect. Under that plan, if any one ofthe top 25 Borden managers were dismissed after a takeover withoutcause, all 25 would leave the company.   In other words, if a raider took over Borden at less than the``fair'' price, and then tried to sell off one of Borden'sdivisions, the head of that division would be considered dismissedwithout cause, and the 24 other top executives would tenderresignations. The agreements with the 25 would be in force for threeyears after a takeover.   ``In effect, if (a bidder) refused to pay our shareholders a fairprice under this new standard, it would be difficult for him torestructure or sell off parts of the company for a period of threeyears,'' Ventres said. ``The moment he tried, he would lose the keyoperating management.''   Ventres said the 25 managers agreed to the plan because they haveinvested an average of 21 years in the company and want it to remainindependent. They also received enhancements in their employmentcontracts, he said.   Under their previous contracts, each would have received two tothree years' pay upon termination after a takeover, depending on thenumber of years of service. Under the enhanced contracts, each wouldreceive up to three years' pay. Each also would receive a stockoption equal to his last stock option.   Ventres said the total cost of the employment contracts, shouldthey be terminated upon a hostile takeover and breakup, would rangefrom $35 million in the first year of the three-year period, wheneach would receive three years' pay, to $10 million in the thirdyear, when each would receive a minimum amount.   He rejected characterizing the contracts as ``goldenparachutes.'' He said they were standard employment contracts thatwere enhanced slightly under the new plan.   John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., said the plan was unique, but questioned itseffectiveness.   ``It's not really going to stand in the way of an all-cash bidthat the shareholders view as fair,'' he said. ``I just view it asanother form of a poison pill, that might make Borden a little lessvulnerable to a takevoer, but I stress the word little.''   He added that Borden did not seem a likely takover target for tworeasons: Its management has done a good job boosting its stockprice, and nearly 40 percent of its sales volume is in milk, abusiness in which a company has a hard time controlling themarketplace. Corporate raiders, he said, usually target companiesthat have a firm grip on their markets.   ``It does show one thing about Borden: that there is acamaraderie of top managers,'' he said. ``They do emphasize the wordteam. They all socialize together. It's a real good environment.''   For 1987, Borden had a profit of $267 million on sales of $6.5billion; it estimates its sales last year rose to $7.2 billion. Thecompany is a leader in the dairy, snack food, pasta, groceryproducts, wall covering, forest product resins and packaging-filmsfields.</TEXT></DOC>
