Igor Malashenko, foreign policy adviser to the Communist Party,told reporters at the same news conference that ``this victory ofYeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem for Gorbachev. Yeltsinis also a reformer, although he reflects concepts which aredifferent from Gorbachev.   ``In this respect I believe it can strengthen the cause ofreform in the Soviet Union. Today many people blame Gorbachev forproblems and now they have another person to blame.''
