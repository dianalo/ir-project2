Rates on six-month Treasury bills jumped about a third of a percentage point to more than 7 1/4%. Prices of actively traded 30-year government issues fell about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, as the yield surged to 9 7/8%, the high for the year and the highest since early December 1985.    Fear that rates may rise even further triggered a sell-off in the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 34.44 points to 2516.64. At one point yesterday afternoon, the industrial average was down more than 54 points. In the foreign exchange market, the dollar declined against major currencies.    &quot;People's perception of short-term rates has changed dramatically, and that's affecting&quot; both the bond and stock markets, said William Wallace, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. In the Eurodollar market, where banks arrange the bulk of their short-term financing, &quot;There's been a lot of scrambling to lock in today's rates on the assumption they will be a lot higher months from now.&quot;    At the Chicago-based International Monetary Market, for example, implied rates on three-month Eurodollar deposits rose 0.20 percentage point yesterday to about 9.05%. Prices of the so-called nearby Eurodollar contract fell to 90.95 from 91.16 Wednesday.    &quot;There was widespread talk of (portfolio) liquidations,&quot; said Richard L. Sandor, a senior vice president in charge of the institutional financial futures division at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. In addition, &quot;we hit a lot of sell stops,&quot; or price levels that triggered immediate sell orders from customers, he said. &quot;People are very nervous.&quot;    The Eurodollar market &quot;reflects the perception among traders and investors around the world that the West German and Japanese monetary authorities are tightening credit, driving down the dollar and forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten as well,&quot; said Mickey D. Levy, senior vice president at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia.    &quot;Everything that's going to aggravate&quot; Fed Chairman &quot;Alan Greenspan is happening,&quot; Mr. Levy said. &quot;But the Fed should resist pressures to tighten given the slowdown in money growth in recent months, because such a move might jeopardize the economic expansion.&quot;    Speculation that the Federal Reserve is tightening credit again swept through the markets yesterday. Some economists predict the Fed soon will raise its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions. Fed officials indicated yesterday that a discount rate increase isn't imminent.    Other economists say the Fed will try subtler, less visible credit-tightening maneuvers in the hope that these will eliminate the need for such an overt move as a discount rate increase.    &quot;Everyone thinks the Fed is going to tighten again,&quot; said James R. Caywood, chief executive officer of Caywood-Christian Capital Management in San Diego. &quot;I don't think he (Fed Chairman Greenspan) wants to, but it looks like he will be forced to just to prove we still have an inflation watchdog.    &quot;I don't see inflation coming back strong, and I don't think he (Mr. Greenspan) does either,&quot; Mr. Caywood continued. &quot;But he has to prove to the market that he means business.&quot;    One incentive for the Federal Reserve to tighten credit now is that such a move might eliminate the need for stronger action next year during the presidential election campaign.    &quot;I guess their view is if they act now to arrest inflation fears, they won't have to do as much later,&quot; said Peter Bass, a managing director of S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. The Fed, though, faces a dilemma: &quot;In order to attract capital from abroad, we have to keep our interest rates up -- even though it will hurt our economy,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the box we're in.&quot;    Bond traders yesterday were particularly concerned by another increase in the closely watched interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight. Federal funds averaged 7.53%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). That was up from 7.43% in the week ended Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said.    Some analysts say the higher funds rate could be a sign that the Fed already is tightening. It also has aroused fear of another discount rate increase because the funds rate recently has been nearly 1 1/2 percentage points above the discount rate, an unusually wide spread, some traders contend.    Whatever the case, &quot;We are in a long-term bear market for bonds,&quot; said Sung Won Sohn, a senior vice president at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis. &quot;I'm quite bearish about the value of the dollar and the direction of interest rates.&quot; As a result of huge U.S. foreign debts and &quot;our dependence on foreign capital, we do not have control of our economic destiny,&quot; he said, adding that yields on 30-year government bonds could soar to 12 1/2% in three years as the dollar drops to about 120 yen. Yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 144.33 yen in late New York trading.    &quot;I'm sure Mr. Greenspan would like to avoid a recession,&quot; said Mr. Sohn. &quot;But whether we like it or not, a recession will be forced upon us&quot; within the next three years. Nevertheless, he said the Fed likely will resist market pressures to tighten credit soon. &quot;We could actually have a bond market rally in the months ahead because the market is plain oversold.&quot;    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 7.42 points yesterday to close at 1160.32, its lowest level since Nov. 15, 1985. The index finished just above its lowest level of the day of 1158.26. The high was 1169.74.    The government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 slumped to a price of 90 15/32 from 91 Wednesday. The yield climbed to 9.87%, the highest since Dec. 5, 1985, when it was also 9.87%, according to Shearson Lehman. On Wednesday, the yield was 9.81%.    The issue yesterday traded as low as 90 11/32, to yield 9.88%. As recently as midday Wednesday, it traded as high as about 92 1/8, where the yield was around 9.69%.    At the beginning of this year, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded about 7 1/2%.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell yesterday to a price of 93 from 93 3/8 Wednesday. The yield increased to 9.74% from 9.68%.    Traders attributed part of the market's rout yesterday to swollen inventories of new four-year and seven-year government notes auctioned this week. The yield on the Treasury's new four-year notes, for example, surged yesterday to 9.39% from an average auction rate of 9.24%. The yield on the new seven-year notes climbed to 9.71% from an average auction rate of 9.51%.    Earlier this week, dealers on Wall Street &quot;got excited about the auctions and ran up&quot; prices on the notes, said Mr. Wallace of Morgan Stanley. &quot;But the investment community won't pay up for supply in a bear market.&quot; Dealers &quot;had to find out the hard way this week as the market crumbled.&quot;    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose to 6.68% bid from 6.52% Wednesday. The rate on the latest six-month bill surged to 7.27% bid from 6.95%.
