Lawmakers areconsidering sweeping changes in the makeup of the Soviet Union, includingreforming it as a loose confederation of sovereign states.;   &quot;I hope thesession will have enough wisdom to make the only possible decision in thesecircumstances,&quot; he said.;   Gorbachev, who spoke after Russian President BorisYeltsin harshly criticized him for failing to foresee the coup, said this wasnot the time for divisiveness.;   &quot;I think there should be some understandingof my position . . . We are all one, side by side. We should not spit on oneanother,&quot; Gorbachev told the Congress.;   With two-thirds of the Sovietrepublics expressing determination to go their own way, many of them areworried about possible bullying by the sprawling, wealthy Russian Federation.;  Yeltsin, in a 10-minute address to the lawmakers, pledged that the Russianrepublic would be an &quot;equal among equals.&quot;;   &quot;The Russian state, which haschosen democracy and freedom, will never be an empire or big or littlebrother,&quot; he declared.;   But later, in an interview with Cable News Network,Yeltsin suggested that in light of the Russian republic's size and power --and its role in crushing the coup -- Russians should hold key posts of primeminister, defense minister, KGB chairman and interior minister.;   In theinterview, Yeltsin said Gorbachev had no choice but to go along with the lossof central power in the wake of the coup.;   &quot;Now this is his last chance,&quot; hesaid. &quot;If he continues together with the democratic movement and Russia and herecognizes the independence of all the other republics, yes, his politicallife will be extended,&quot; he said.;   Meanwhile, there were growing indicationstoday that the question of Baltic independence might not be decidedimmediately by the Congress. Gorbachev had said lawmakers would take up thematter, although independence for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia is regarded bymany as a given. At the United Nations today, Western diplomats said Britainand France would present formal requests from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania tobecome members of the world body.;   President Bush on Monday formallyrecognized Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as independent.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  546  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247203,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
