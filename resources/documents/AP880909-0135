While no direct link has been established between smoking andleukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showedthat the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, andfor smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.   ``If the findings in our study represented a direct relationshipbetween smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking isresponsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hithertoestablished causes combined,'' said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of theCancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.   Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veteranswith E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and BloodInstitute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,Maryland.   They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia andsmoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence thatleukemia is a smoking-related disease.''   In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor NicholasWald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that nocause-and-effect relationship had been established.   But he added: ``Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidencesuggests that smoking may cause leukemia.''   It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization'slist of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.   The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veteransbetween 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote. During that period723 died of leukemia. Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 wereex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.   The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rateamong smokers was sharply higher than the average.   Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokersof more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, comparedwith 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death fromlymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10cigarettes, 40 percent higher.   When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, itsuggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk. Thedeath rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and amongex-smokers 39 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
