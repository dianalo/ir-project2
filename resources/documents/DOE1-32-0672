By this study, startedin FY 1981, the construction of the 100 kW pilot plant in Miyake Island,operation test of the plant, and combination test of the plant with thepower distribution systems, were made. In FY 1986, the pilot plant wascannibalized, followed by inspection of each part and the strength testof the blade. Significant degradations in the paint of the blade werefound. Also, holes and grooves in the joint between the upper and thelower surface of the blade were found. The joint method should be improved.The nacelle was more or less rusted. No significant problems on the axes,the bearings, the couplings, and the lubricating oil were found. Thebending test of the blade, and the strength test of the blade membersgave good results. However, the adhesion of the CFRP to the blade surface,and the shape of the internal webs should be further examined. The resultshave revealed that the pilot plant has a sufficient durability.
