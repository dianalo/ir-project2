The parents spent several nights a week searching for theirdaughter's attacker despite police warnings they were putting theirlives in danger and probably wasting their time, The ColumbusDispatch said in a copyright story.   The father, armed with a gun, would wait in a car while his wifeacted as a decoy on the same corner where her daughter was raped inJune 1987, the newspaper said.   Police announced Monday that Robert Biddings, 34, was arrestedThursday and was being held in the Franklin County jail on onecount of rape and two counts of kidnapping in lieu of $750,000bond. They said they would seek to have him charged with up to 60rapes.   Biddings is a suspect in a series of attacks dating back to 1984that had been attributed to the ``handcuff rapist,'' so calledbecause he used handcuffs in early attacks, said police spokeswomanDenise Pangborn.   The Dispatch, quoting police reports, court records andunidentified sources, said the rape victim's parents decided totrack down their 23-year-old daughter's attacker themselves andfind the evidence needed to break the case.   The father said he knew police were understaffed and could notspend as much time on the case as he and his wife wanted. TheDispatch interviewed the father Monday but did not identify him.   The newspaper gave this account of how the trap was sprung:   On the night of Friday, Aug. 5 _ the same day of the week andthe same time of day their daughter was attacked _ the mother wasstanding on the corner just east of downtown, when a man parked hiscar and walked toward her.   The attacker grabbed her, dragged her toward nearby FranklinPark and drew a gun. The woman's husband ran from his car, alsodrew a gun and said: ``Freeze! Police!''   The attacker ran to his car and fled.   The husband wrote down the car's license plate and calledpolice. The license number was traced to a car owned by Biddings,who was arrested after police searched his apartment.   The charges against Biddings relate to the case involving thecouple's daughter.   So far, Biddings has been linked to 19 additional attacks, saidpolice Capt. Antone Lanata.   ``The victims have picked him out of a photo display, or byphysical evidence _ fingerprints,'' Lanata said. Interviews withother victims were continuing, he said.   Evidence against Biddings will be presented to a Franklin Countygrand jury, accompanied by requests for indictments on 60 counts ofrape and more than 100 other miscellaneous felony counts, Ms.Pangborn said.   The attacks occurred throughout the city, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
