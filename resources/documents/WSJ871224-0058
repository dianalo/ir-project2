The dollar avoided coming under immediate pressure mainly because many banks and major institutions are reluctant to take large positions this late in the fourth quarter.    &quot;Liquidity is just nonexistent,&quot; Albert Soria, a vice president for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. &quot;Because of the holidays and year end, activity is winding down to zero.&quot; He and other dealers said many traders were only squaring positions ahead of the new year.    Still, many traders and economists predicted that the dollar will come under new selling pressure, possibly as early as January.    Late Tuesday night, the seven major industrial nations issued a communique saying the dollar had fallen far enough. They said that volatile currency movements, a further decline by the U.S. currency or an excessively sharp rise in its value could damage world economic growth.    The statement also said the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- &quot;agreed to cooperate closely on exchange markets.&quot;    &quot;It was a yawn,&quot; Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said of the statement. &quot;This thing was written a month ago. They hammered out a lot of ambiguous language that satisfied everybody and doesn't say anything very clearly about where currency markets will go.&quot;    Traders and analysts were particularly disappointed that there was no actual meeting of Group of Seven members; the communique's wording was negotiated by telephone. Also causing concern was the fact that there were no hints of what exchange-rate target zones the nations might seek to defend, nor any U.S. commitment to use higher interest rates to support the dollar if needed.    &quot;What seems important was not so much what it said but what it didn't say,&quot; John Lipsky, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., said. &quot;It looks like an effort to buy time so that policy measures already in place can have an impact.&quot; Those measures include legislation passed this week to cut the U.S. budget deficit, recent cuts in European interest rates and a program in Japan to stimulate growth through expansionary fiscal policy.    Mr. Soria said, &quot;There's a strong statement that the dollar has fallen far enough, but no strong fiscal or monetary policy to back that up, so the market's brushing this aside.&quot; Without any such support on the policy side, he said, &quot;The dollar's going to have a tough time going up.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6335 West German marks, up from 1.6275 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. currency also rose marginally to 126.64 Japanese yen from 126.37 a day earlier. The British pound fell to $1.8250 from $1.8335 Tuesday.    Earlier in Europe, the dollar climbed as high as 1.6450 marks and 127.15 yen on some large purchases and covering of short, or oversold, positions after Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the U.S. currency was undervalued. But it soon fell back.    &quot;Most disappointing is that the dollar didn't hold its highs of the day,&quot; Fred Scala, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said.    Mr. Scala also cited news reports that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in Tokyo that there was no need for an immediate Group of Seven meeting.    &quot;It means they've got no hard proposals to lay out on the table,&quot; he said.    He also noted White House economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel's comment that the seven-nation accord doesn't require the U.S. to raise interest rates to support the dollar if it should fall.    &quot;Looking at that, I've got to feel negative on the dollar,&quot; Mr. Scala said.    Because of the scant trading as the year ends, few traders expect the dollar to face enough concerted selling to test the central banks' resolve before next year. But Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs said, &quot;Unless there is a G-7 meeting with a specific agenda, speculative interests in the market will reappear, and the dollar will trade lower.&quot;    Mr. Lipsky said Salomon Brothers predicts the currency will fall to 120 yen and 1.50 marks by mid-1988 and move even lower thereafter.    The first big test of whether the central banks will defend the U.S. currency through intervention or interest-rate moves may well come after the November U.S. trade results are announced Jan. 15, traders said. After the record $17.6 billion October deficit was announced this month, many traders and analysts said the gap would have to narrow to $14 billion or even $13 billion to help the currency.    &quot;If it comes in at $15 billion to $16 billion, it'll be bearish,&quot; Mr. Witten said.    Nonetheless, Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London, said the odds are good that the next three months' trade results will be positive enough to delay a renewed market assault on the dollar. For seasonal reasons, he said, U.S. trade data normally improve in November and December. Moreover, he said, recent declines in oil prices could cut as much as $1.5 billion from the U.S.'s import bill, and he considers October's wide deficit figure an aberration.    Mr. Dennis also said the stock market crash can be expected to cut U.S. consumer spending, especially on durable goods such as electronic products and automobiles, many of which are imported.    &quot;The objective of the (Group of Seven) statement is to tide the market over the tricky year-end period when the dollar can fluctuate wildly in thin markets,&quot; Mr. Dennis said. &quot;They didn't want to go forward without saying anything.&quot;    A few contrarians even say positive trade numbers could cause the dollar to soar. Victor Polce, a vice president at Merrill Lynch International, said he sees the currency topping 1.75 marks in the first quarter of 1988 and &quot;wouldn't be surprised&quot; to see it above 1.90 marks during the year.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery settled at $482.90 an ounce, down $1. Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $483.45 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    In early Tokyo trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 126.55 yen, little changed from the levels it held all day yesterday.    ---                   Late New York Trading                  Wednesday, Dec. 23, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
