It's a telephone inRobert Burkett's office here.   Mr. Burkett, a 46-year-old lawyer turned movie-industryexecutive, is the Nebraska senator's chief money man, theleader of an army he affectionately calls &quot;Kerrey's cashcommandos.&quot; He belongs to an exclusive club of top Democraticfund-raisers, and since Labor Day has spent night and dayprospecting in a golden Rolodex built up through years ofwork in liberal Hollywood.   Mr. Burkett has all the qualifications for a big-timefund-raiser: a thick skin toughened by raising money for theDemocratic National Committee's large-donor program; analmost bottomless capacity for talking on the phone; and alot of resources behind him -- not his own, but those of hisboss, movie producer Frederick (Ted) Field, an heir to theMarshall Field department-store fortune.   Better than anyone else, Mr. Burkett knows that the rulesof campaign fundraising are brutally simple: Money follows awinner. That is why the stakes are almost as high for him intoday's South Dakota primary as they are for his candidate.If Mr. Kerrey wins the state, Mr. Burkett will immediatelybegin dialing for fresh campaign dollars to refill Mr.Kerrey's badly depleted campaign coffers. But a disappointingshowing will almost certainly mean that money will stopflowing through the pipeline Mr. Burkett has so carefullyconstructed these past months.   &quot;For us, South Dakota is a mini-New Hampshire,&quot; Mr.Burkett says from his Westwood office at Interscope Group,Mr. Field's film-production company, where he is vicepresident. A victory, he says, means &quot;we'll have the abilityto raise Super Tuesday money.&quot;   Money has been very tight for Mr. Kerrey these days, sotight that the candidate himself has borrowed funds and ismaking many of the key fund-raising calls in between campaignstops in South Dakota and Colorado. Mr. Burkett issupplementing those calls with entreaties of his own,following the same grueling routine he has had since thefall.   His day begins when he rises at 5 a.m.; by 5:30 he ismaking calls from his home here to potential donors on theEast Coast. He doesn't break until noon, when he gets awayfrom the pressures of money-raising to go running. Then hedrives to his office, where two separate campaign-telephonelines converge on a large desk adorned with a bust of RobertF. Kennedy.   During an interview in his office, one of severalconducted over the course of the campaign, Mr. Burkettreflects on what keeps him going. Mainly, he says, he ismotivated by deep affection for Mr. Kerrey, whom he metseveral years ago. &quot;He's a true friend,&quot; says Mr. Burkett.&quot;It's unusual to get to know a politician without his gameface on.&quot;   Early on, Mr. Burkett's loyalities to the Kerrey campaignwere challenged by illness. Soon after he had signed on asfinance chairman, he was hospitalized with a serious virus(Mr. Burkett thought he was having a heart attack). By thetime his wife allowed him to return to the telephones, Mr.Kerrey was already stumbling in New Hampshire.   Unlike Democratic rival Bill Clinton, whose associationwith the well-funded Democratic Leadership Council gave him abuilt-in network of political contributors, &quot;Bob did not havea natural, national fundraising base,&quot; Mr. Burkett says. SoMr. Burkett had to build one from scratch.   He started with Mr. Kerrey's core group of wealthyNebraskan supporters. Denny Jorgensen, Mr. Kerrey's Nebraskafinance chairman, pledged to raise between $250,000 and $1million by Thanksgiving. (The Nebraskans, Mr. Burkett says,are the real heroes of Kerrey's cash commandos.) AnotherDemocratic heavy hitter, Florida businessman Hugh Westbrook,signed on as the campaign's treasurer at about the same timeMr. Burkett came on board. A number of other wellknownDemocratic fund-raisers, including Elizabeth Bagley ofWashington and Walter Shorenstein of San Francisco, alsojoined Mr. Burkett's finance committee.   Mr. Burkett also won endorsements for Mr. Kerrey fromseveral major figures from the entertainment industry. Anearly infusion of money came from a posh, star-studdedreception at the home of Barry Diller, who until yesterdaywas the chairman of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp. But therewere disappointments too, especially the failure to win thehelp of wealthy investor Warren Buffett, a Nebraskan and pastKerrey supporter.   Winning over a single big giver could take weeks. In thefall, Mr. Burkett began working on Leonard Riggio, chairmanof B. Dalton Bookseller Inc. He arranged for Mr. Riggio tomeet with Mr. Kerrey, then continued calling Mr. Riggio untilhe agreed to come on board the finance committee; Mr. Riggiohas since raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mr.Kerrey in New York.   In January, Mr. Burkett was trying hard to secure thesupport of Marvin Rosen, a Florida lawyer whom Mr. Burkettknew well through other Democratic fundraising efforts. &quot;Itwas a coup,&quot; says Mr. Burkett, when Mr. Rosen finally saidyes six weeks ago after traveling with Mr. Kerrey.   Mr. Burkett's admirers and his rival fund-raisers say itis testimony to his clout in Democratic fund-raising circlesthat he has been able to raise almost $1 million for theKerrey campaign in the past seven weeks. He and the 20-oddmembers of the Kerrey finance team continued to pull incontributions even as their candidate was being dismissed bythe media and failing to engage the imagination of voters.&quot;The amazing thing is that Bob Burkett has continued raisingso much money,&quot; says Phil Angelides, the CaliforniaDemocratic Party chairman who raised millions for MichaelDukakis in 1988.   Mr. Burkett traveled to New Hampshire for the primary andsummoned his finance troops to the state for anorganizational dinner on primary night. He flew with thecandidate the next day to South Dakota to help him make someimportant money calls. He was, he says, pleasantly surprisedwhen almost everyone Mr. Kerrey called agreed to raise moremoney. &quot;The loyalty of our people is amazing,&quot; gushes Mr.Burkett. &quot;It was really magnificent.&quot;   Mr. Burkett tries to minimize his time away from thephones. He is so reluctant to lose precious phone time thathe skipped a cabaret fund-raising party he had planned forMr. Kerrey at New York's Regency Hotel because he preferredto stay in his room making more fund-raising calls.   If Mr. Kerrey drops out of the presidential contest, Mr.Burkett will still have a big role in the election. Whileserving as the Kerrey finance director, he is also in chargeof the Democratic National Committee's large-donor program.(Last year, he helped organize a gathering of major donors atthe Middleburg, Va., estate of party doyenne PamelaHarriman.) Mr. Burkett is now directing a fund-raisingprogram aimed at increasing the number of individual donorswilling to give the party $200,000 each.   In the mid-1980s, Mr. Burkett first drew attention fromnational political circles as producer Norman Lear'spolitical eyes and ears. From Mr. Lear's office, Mr. Burkettwent to his current position with Mr. Field, producer of suchscreen hits as &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; and the nanny thriller,&quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.&quot;   At Interscope, Mr. Field's production company, Mr. Burkettdevotes himself to his boss's passions: movies, chess andDemocratic politics. (He organized the World ChessChampionship program for Mr. Field in 1990 and hopes to writea book about the experience.) &quot;It's a unique situation,&quot; saysDemocratic consultant Anthony Podesta about the relationshipbetween Mr. Burkett and Mr. Field. &quot;Because Ted is soreclusive, Bob's become a big force in his own right. Eventhough he doesn't have his own money, he's used Ted's verydeep pockets and long leash to build his own fund-raisingbase.&quot; In 1987, Mr. Burkett helped raise more than $400,000for Sen. Joseph Biden's presidential campaign at a party atMr. Field's home.   Even if Mr. Kerrey loses tonight, Mr. Burkett says he willcontinue raising money no matter what. &quot;I'm always upbeat,&quot;he says. &quot;I see opportunity in everything.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
