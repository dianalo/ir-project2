Reagan's weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office,coincided with a published report that independent counsel James C.McKay's investigation of the attorney general shows that Meeseinitially indicated he may have had knowledge about possiblyillegal payments to the Israeli Labor Party in connection with a $1billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.   Meese announced his upcoming resignation Tuesday, the dayMcKay's report, which has not been made public, was filed in court.The attorney general said the independent counsel's investigationvindicates him.   ``With the announcement by Ed Meese, now that his name has beencleared, that he will be returning to private life this summer, Iwould like to take a minute to recognize a public servant ofdedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20years,'' the president said.   ``As counselor at the White House and as attorney general, EdMeese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminalsbehind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcementand to fight organized crime,'' Reagan said.   He said Meese also ``led our Justice Department as itaggressively ``achieved more convictions for civil rightsviolations than any previous administration.''   He also praised Meese's anti-terrorism efforts, saying he``worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecutethose who wage war on innocent members of free societies.''</TEXT><HEAD>FOLLOWING MATERIAL EMBARGOED FOR 1:06 p.m. EDT</HEAD><TEXT>   Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, delivering the Democraticresponse to the president's speech, said, ``Mr. President, now thatthe attorney general has finally resigned, I sincerely hope thatyou will take the initiative to appoint someone that can restorethe dignity and the integrity to this great office that itdeserves.''</TEXT><HEAD>END EMBARGOED MATERIAL</HEAD><TEXT>   The New York Times, which obtained portions of the independentcounsel's report, reported today that Meese was asked in November1987 by McKay about his understanding of a memorandum from longtimefriend E. Robert Wallach on the pipeline.   McKay asked whether Meese understood when he received the memoin September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would godirectly to the political party.   McKay asked, ``Was that your understanding in September 1985that was the arrangement?''   Meese replied, ``Again, I can't recall specifically, but thatcertainly would be consistent with my understanding and wouldexplain why Mr. (then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres waspersonally interested.''   However, two months later, Meese submitted a clarification ofhis testimony, saying he didn't recall that part of the memo. Theclarification came a few weeks after the first news accountsreported that the memo from Wallach to Meese mentioned plannedpayments to the Labor Party, constituting a possible violation ofthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, told the Timesthat Meese had been consistent in his statements about hisknowledge of the plan to make payments to the Israeli Labor Party.Lewin said Meese does not recall reading the portion of the memodealing with payments to the political party and that is what Meesemeant to say when he gave the statement to McKay in November 1987.   McKay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of abribery plan and that the available evidence is thereforeinsufficient to conclude Meese's activities on behalf of thepipeline violated the corrupt practices act.   The independent counsel said his pipeline investigation washampered because Israeli officials, including Peres, wereunavailable to be questioned and several American witnesses invokedtheir right not to incriminate themselves.   McKay also said a sensitive Justice Department memo to Meeseabout the pipeline was missing from his department files. Meese hadtestified he had received the memo and might have shared it withWallach, said the report.   The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possibleU.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees for thepipeline, according to the report.   The memo from a department attorney and written at Wallach'surging recommended a possible solution to the legal problem.Department officials were unable to locate it in Meese's files,said the report.   McKay also found that Meese was ``closely involved'' in 1985 indiscussions about building the pipeline. McKay said the project wasof limited interest to the U.S. government until Meese made a``highly unusual'' phone call to the White House in 1985 atWallach's request. Wallach was representing one of the project'spartners, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport. Meese repeatedly hascharacterized his involvement in the project as limited.   The McKay report also said Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burnstold McKay he was ``astonished'' because Meese told him that anoffer of a high Justice Department job to Wallach was still pendingeven after Meese learned that Wallach was the subject of a criminalinvestigation.   The report says Meese learned from his subordinates on April 6,1987, that Wallach, who currently is under indictment onracketeering charges in the Wedtech scandal, was the subject of afederal criminal probe of Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx, N.Y.,defense contractor.   Meese immediately recused himself from all involvement inWedtech matters, but subsequently told Burns he ``had offered Mr.Wallach the position of counselor to the attorney general'' and``that the offer was still open.''   Burns told McKay's office he was ``astonished'' to hear thisfrom Meese but ``maintained a `poker face' and responded by saying,`oh,''' the report said. William Bradford Reynolds, head of thedepartment's civil rights division, eventually got the job insteadof Wallach.</TEXT></DOC>
