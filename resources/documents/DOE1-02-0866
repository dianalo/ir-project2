Beyond 14 days PAM, which alwaysaccounted for over 95% of recovered free cells, appeared larger thannormal and by 100 days included some highly vacuolated 'foamy cells'.The overall incidence of PAM in mitosis was 0.1% in both control andexposed animals. The overall incidence of micronucleated PAM after aninitial alveolar deposition (IAD) of only 20 Bq of {sup 239}PuO{sub 2}-equivalent to a cumulative dose of approx.0.5 Gy {alpha}-radiation at35 days - shows them to be a sensitive indicator of radiation damageto cell nuclei within the lung.</TEXT></DOC>
