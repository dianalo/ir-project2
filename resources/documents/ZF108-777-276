many werefinishing products introduced earlier or rounding out their movement to newtechnology.andP;  There were a few brand-new products--most of which were notquite ready for full introductions.andM;* From Du Pont there was the first public showing of the Omega editorialsystem (now called Whirlwind) using OS/2, but it was not ready for testing.andM;* CText brought a couple of OS/2 products: the completed editorial systeminstalled at the Chicago Tribune and Newport News (Virginia) DailyPress/Times-Herald and a new class-ad system that is several months fromcompletion.andM;* For the third year in a row, CompuText introduced a new system; this timeit rounded out its product line with an editorial system running under Unix.andO;(Last year it introduced a new display ad system, and the year before itentered the market with an impressive classified system.)andM;For others it was a &quot;refinement year.&quot;andM;* System Integrators concentrated on moving its Coyote functionality to PCsand providing a true network to connect them to the Tandem host.andP;  SII alsointroduced Mac/55--a means of connecting a Macintosh to a System/55 Tandemcomputer.andM;* Dewar brought a &quot;now completed&quot; version of its new editorial and classifiedsystems, which were introduced at last year's show.andM;* Cybergraphic showcased the porting of its front-end and display ad softwareto Sun Sparcstations.andM;* Software Consulting Services demonstrated that pagination can be installedtoday with the help of extensions it has written to Quark Xpress.andM;And, as always, there was one exciting new product hidden in a hotel roomnext door.andP;  Andromeda Software demonstrated a powerful &quot;geometry engine,&quot;which could have a significant effect on display ad makeup, catalog work andpossibly pagination itself.andM;Atex features more than IBM dealandM;The biggest story from Atex was the announcement of its joint marketing anddevelopment agreement with IBM, which we covered in depth in our most recentissue.andP;  However, several other topics also deserve mention.andM;News Layout R2.andP;  The new IBM PS/2-based News Layout R2 is a PC version of theexisting GT68-based News Layout package that has been available for manyyears.andP;  Its functionality and interface are similar to those of thehigher-priced GT68 system, which is no longer manufactured.andP;  News Layout R2can link with the Atex Architect system on the Sun 3/50 to take advertisingpage dummies without having to utilize the TPE database.andP;  Architect can alsolink up with the Harris 8300/8900 system.andM;TPE on IBM.andP;  In doubt until the last minute, Atex brought both IBM and DECplatforms to Las Vegas for its Total Publishing Environment, but showed itonly on an IBM RS/4000.andP;  TPE has finally passed from beta status intoshipping status; release 1.0 shipped on the DEC Vax and Sun platforms on July1st.andP;  All six current TPE sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia will be upgradedfor free to the equivalent IBM platform when the software release is ready.andO;Future purchasers of the system on DEC and Sun hardware (if there are any)are advised to lease the hardware until the equivalent IBM hardware andsoftware is ready.andM;J11 integration agreements.andP;  Atex announced an open architecture agreementwith the existing J11 based systems, to integrate other suppliers' productsthrough the TPE database.andP;  Agreements to cooperate on this integration are inplace with companies including Camex and Information International fordisplay ads, Harris for display ads and pagination, Associated Press (Leaf)and Sinclair for picture wire service, Scitex for color, and Lennane forPostScript RIPs.andP;  Other suppliers were more in the newspaper business areas.andM;Color.andP;  In the area of color, Atex displayed the Designmaster 8000 systemlinked with the new Sparcstation-based Stripping Station and Macintosh-basedDesign Station, as shown at Drupa.andP;  Linked into the Design Station was a newlow-cost Kodak scanner, a medium-resolution area array unit that scanned 35mmcolor or monochrome transparencies or negatives with a resolution of 1,035 X1,320 pixels.andP;  It produced a 4.2-MB color file.andP;  This scanner was also shownas part of the Kodak picture scanning and transmission system (see Kodak onpage 25).andM;Atex live at Whittle.andP;  In our last issue, we reported the details of Atex'snew relationship to IBM, but we didn't talk about its small system formagazines.andP;  PC Page Makeup, as it is called, is now running live at WhittleCommunications, doing about half of the Best of Business publication.andP;  It isrunning under Microsoft Windows 2 with a Sun Microsystems file server,although an IBM RS/6000 RISC computer will be substituted later.andP;  Four PCPage Makeup stations are in use--two in the editorial department and two inproduction--with additional PS/2s scattered around several buildings.andM;The delay in getting the system into live production was attributed in partto turnover in personnel at the Whittle site.andM;Atex said it is expecting to install another system soon at a location notyet identified.andP;  It also said it is looking seriously at OS/2 but hasn't madeany commitments to it.andM;Rising Comet from CompuTextandM;CompuText came to its third ANPA show with its third new product--Comet, aneditorial system that mixes DOS and Unix.andP;  Comet rounds out a complete systemsuite for CompuText, which had previously introduced a Unix/PC classifiedsystem and a Mac display ad makeup product.andM;Most of Comet's basic features, including support for Associated Press wireservices, were demonstrable at the show.andP;  Other wires will be accommodatedshortly.andP;  The wire routing has a nice user-definable scheme that may beconfigured at any user terminal.andP;  Users specify their own selection criteriafor wire stories and route appropriate stories to their queues, based ondesignator fields and key words.andM;Because Comet operates in a multitasking operating system (Unix), wires aresupported directly within the file servers.andP;  (Most PC-based systems dedicatea separate PC for capturing wires.)andP;  Up to eight 9,600-baud lines areaccommodated within one server.andM;At the user level, CompuText has chosen DOS with the Desqview extender.andP;  Itconsciously shunned Windows because its first objective was to work with anenvironment that was &quot;well behaved and predictable.&quot;andM;Comet will allow the use of different PC-based editors.andP;  At the show,CompuText demonstrated XyWrite because of its popularity in the newspapermarket.andM;CompuText appears to be following the Dewar philosophy of pure off-the-shelfsoftware wherever possible--including unmodified editors such as XyWrite.andO;And, as with Dewar, a user moving from database access, directories and filemanagement to writing and editing stories, must contend with changes in userinterfaces.andP;  For the most part, CompuText has done a good job of minimizingthis annoyance--for example, by using XyWrite popup windows to leave the userdirectly in the XyWrite editor as much as possible.andP;  Therefore, once you loginto the system, you are immediately presented with a XyWrite screen fromwhich to create new stories or edit older ones.andP;  When finished editing, youare presented with a form to fill in the header, which includes otherinformation about the story (department, page info, etc.).andM;CompuText is using composition software it borrowed from its classifiedsystem.andP;  It is also using its own dictionary, which is resident on the hostfile servers.andP;  Therefore, during handamp;j, when line/word breaks are required, thelocal PC has to access the host for the hyphenation points.andM;CompuText says its centralized approach to composition helps to control thedictionary (because it maintains only one copy), and it doesn't affect systemperformance.andP;  However, based on other vendors trying similar schemes, wewouldn't be surprised to see CompuText switch to a complete, &quot;handamp;j in theterminal&quot; approach.andM;Queue directory and selective directory requests are made withfill-in-the-blank menus.andP;  Relational and wild card searching are supported,as are searches across the entire database.andP;  CompuText has done a nice job indisplaying the results directly within the editing program (in this caseXyWrite).andM;The target for installation of the system is a beta test slated forSeptember.andP;  It will be very interesting to compare this system to Dewar'swhen it is complete.andP;  There are many similarities (like the pureoff-the-shelf philosophy) and several key differences (like the database,multiple servers, and Unix versus DOS at the file server level).andM;Architecture enhancements.andP;  Another new enhancement to the generalarchitecture of CompuText's front-end systems is the addition of multipleservers (currently limited to eight, but this could be expanded asnecessary).andP;  This approach is similar to the multiple-server approaches ofthe third-generation, minicomputer-based systems, in which files are backedup across the network by sending them to another server, which stores aduplicate version of all files on its own disk.andP;  If more than two servers arebeing used, the data will be duplicated on all servers in the network.andO;CompuText points out that this process has a negligible effect on performancewhile keeping all disks in the system identical--and therefore simplifyingthe system management job.andM;Locking of files is handled by a concept of a &quot;master server,&quot; which controlsoverall system access.andP;  This method is in contrast to many of the PC-basedsystems, which simply shadow the database on a second disk tied to a singlefile server.andP;  The full automatic backup and redundancy of this newarchitecture will be available in October.andM;In addition to providing excellent file backup, multiple servers alsodynamically balance the file serving load for all users.andP;  This includes thebalancing of tasks that run in batch mode.andM;CAT display ad system.andP;  CompuText also demonstrated the latest release of itsCAT system for building display ads.andP;  Among the new features are rotation ofelements in 1 [degree] increments, either visually or by specifying a value;an enlarged tool palette; generation of graphics from geometric figures(ovals and polygons, but not starbursts); haloing; automasking based onfinding areas bounded by black pixels; and pixel editing.andM;CompuText also has redone its capabilities for aligning text and geometricobjects with respect to each other.andP;  This feature uses the Macintosh boundingboxes to determine the shape of a text element, thus taking into accountascenders and descenders.andP;  Therefore top-aligning a rectangle with a block oftext that doesn't have ascenders will place the top of the x-height of thetext even with the top of the rectangle.andP;  Grid lines also are available foralignment.andM;Finally, CompuText has revised its method of displaying fonts.andP;  It now startswith PostScript font outlines and generates its own outlines, which arescaled to the exact specifications of the text.andM;Crosfield communications controllerandM;Crosfield had no color products that we hadn't seen a few weeks before atDrupa.andP;  The Crosfield (Camex) developments in newspaper publishing systemswere covered in our last issue.andP;  The only other item that we had not seen indetail before was the new Communicator, a PC running with a Motif-likeinterface to control the link with the Wydnet wide area communicationsnetwork for transferring contone images between remote sites.andP;  This isparticularly applicable in load-sharing environments where images aretransferred for subsequent work at remote sites.andM;CText introduces AdvisionandM;CText's Advision was one of the few new products at the show.andP;  Advision is anan OS/2-based classified system developed to complement CText's OS/2-basededitorial system (installed at Chicago and Newport News).andP;  OS/2 is being usedfor the operating system at the terminal level--which will probably be&quot;well-equipped '386 PCs.&quot;andP;  At the database-file server level will be Sybasedatabase software, also running under OS/2.andP;  This configuration should besufficient to handle between 50 and 70 terminals before performance becomesan issue.andM;Multiple everything.andP;  The goal of Advision is to reach beyond the previousDOS-based system and offer &quot;multiple everything&quot;--from multiple zones tomultiple products, with accompanying schedules that indicate whatpublications a single (or group of ads) can run in.andP;  With newspapers movingto more and more zones and products, CText has been feeling the heat to offera system that could easily handle the scheduling, complex pricing andautomatic sorting/selection and typesetting of these ads.andM;With Advision, CText has coupled OS/2's power of multiple windows withMicrosoft's off-the-shelf spreadsheet Excel.andP;  The scheduler and windowsshowing the multiple product selections have a dynamic link into Excel.andO;Therefore, as an ad is priced, Excel is invoked in the background to pricethe ads and report the results to the application package.andM;This all happens invisibly to the user, but at the same time it gives anadministrator a friendly tool (Excel) for adding and modifying rates.andO;However, we expect that there will be rates with which even Excel might havetrouble.andP;  For these, CText will have to complete some custom programming.andO;But the idea is to make the system &quot;application- and user-customizable&quot;without the need for programmers.andM;The same flexibility offered by the rate table is carried over to the headerfields.andP;  Again, these are user-defined and flexible.andP;  Headers are simplywindows of the system.andP;  Other windows are used as selling tools--likeresolicitation reports, phone search windows and other prompts used duringthe sale of ads.andP;  Windows are also used effectively to show options fordifferent products and groups of products and to show multiple calendarsrelating to complex multiple product/zone ads.andP;  Advision makes judicious useof color for distinguishing what ads are running on what days in complexschedules.andM;Also included is an auto-dialer (again, off-the-shelf software integratedinto the package), which is used for online credit card checking and accountbalancing.andP;  Hypertext help is also included using the full PresentationManager support.andP;  The user even has viewing preferences.andP;  Windows aredisplayed in several different ways in different sizes, tailored to theuser's preference and the task--header, text or composed ads.andP;  It all ads upto more user-friendliness.andM;XyWrite is being used for the editor, coupled with Adobe Type Manager fontswhen they become available for the PC.andP;  A dynamic preview of the ad inWYSIWYG mode (from Deucalion) shows the composed view of the ad, much likeCamex's Whirlwind product being developed for Houston.andM;The concentration of the system is clearly as a &quot;user supportable andconfigurable&quot; sales tool.andP;  It won't be ready until the fourth quarter of thisyear, but what was shown supported that focus.andM;CText will offer both this new system and its DOS product.andP;  Why?andP;  Price.andP;  Thenew system will cost about 40% more than the DOS one, although thatdifference will drop over time.andP;  The majority of that price difference comesfrom OS/2 itself, the hardware and software to support it (8 MB of RAM, forexample, with a color monitor) and the extra integrated programs such asExcel.andM;Editorial, pagination near completion.andP;  On the editorial side, XyWrite forOS/2 finally appears to be stable.andP;  CText is incorporating version IV ofXyWrite without the WYSIWYG presentation.andP;  Optionally, it will use Deucalionsoftware to provide WYSIWYG previews.andP;  CText is pursuing full WYSIWYG editingvia its own composition (Deucalean) software as well.andP;  Chicago is 80%finished writing its macros and formats and will be going live this summer--amilestone when it happens.andM;The next version of the editorial system (Dateline) will add event trackingfor editors.andP;  Dateline will provide management assistance with full databasequeries and tracking of all its elements.andP;  It will add alerting to the systemfor critical deadline events and help automate the newsroom's overall copyflow.andP;  (In other words, it will tell you when the system is out of sync withoptimum schedules.)andM;CText will offer the same class ad pagination product for both the old DOSsystem and Advision.andP;  Its pagination product will be an OS/2 version of theToronto package.andP;  The internals of the package are untouched from theoriginal Toronto software, but CText is modifying the user interface tocomply with OS/2; we expect it to be more intuitive than it is now.andM;The OS/2 version will be available in the fourth quarter of 1990.andP;  Includedwill be a WYSIWYG preview of EPS files of classified display ads created onany other system.andP;  When finished, this will give CText a full classifiedpagination offering--including classified display ads created on any othersystem that can output EPS files.andM;Another product in the CText booth was Ventura Publisher being used foreditorial page makeup.andP;  This is an unreleased Windows 3.0 version of theproduct, which appears to be an interesting alternative to Quark Xpress.andP;  Wehope to learn more about it.andM;Cybergraphic tells its storyandM;Cybergraphic came to the ANPA show with one message: &quot;Pagination workstoday.&quot;andP;  There weren't many new products or features in the booth--just themessage that what it has accomplished at The National (the national sportsdaily) can be duplicated elsewhere.andM;In its quest to become completely platform independent, Cybergraphic recentlyported its software to one more terminal--the Sparcstation from SunMicrosystems.andP;  The porting of its display ad software to the Sparc provedbeneficial in the speed department: it is much faster than on any of theother workstations Cybergraphic offers.andP;  The Sparcstation (SLC) is also beingused for editorial software, which has been running on '386 PCs.andP;  All ofCybergraphic's software also runs on the DEC Station 3100, and much of itruns on Macs and Cybergraphic's own terminals as well.andM;Cybergraphic brought the advertising database from its Annapolis customer andthe editorial database from the National to ANPA to replicate a realnewspaper environment.andP;  Its booth reinforced Cybergraphic's current focus ona steady course toward becoming platform independent rather than addingfeatures.andM;Dewar shows completed systemandM;Dewar, another one of the system independents, came to the show primarilywith refinements, completing the work on the new editorial and classifiedsystems it introduced at ANPA last year.andP;  About 30 to 35 of these systems arenow installed in the field.andP;  Dewar feels that some of the rough edges(particularly in the classified system) that have plagued it the last fewmonths are now worked out, and its systems are now stable.andP;  For example, theclassified system now supports skips and premium day pricing and is muchcleaner in its screen transitions between the class database software and theXyWrite editor.andP;  With fewer popups and a more streamlined integration of thevarious software packages included in the classified product, the userinterface is significantly improved.andP;  Dewar is also being pressured to addmore account receivable functionality to its standard classified product.andM;Dewar's editorial software now runs full reports on the editorialdatabase--similar to the classified product.andP;  Dewar is making better use ofXyWrite forms facilities and has added a third-party electronic mail packageto its arsenal of applications.andM;There was some talk that Dewar might experiment with another off-the-shelfdatabase, but for now it is sticking with Ashton-Tate's dBase IV for botheditorial and classified.andP;  It is working on a full tracking system that willeventually be expanded into a full graphics database, again based on dBase.andO;Although Novell 386 is now the standard network for the new systems, Dewar isstill installing Arcnet, not Ethernet.andP;  It offers an Ethernet option, butthere are no Ethernet installations in the field yet.andM;Windows on the horizon.andP;  Looking back at its decision not to rush intoWindows or OS/2 last year, Dewar is pleased.andP;  It feels that Windows 3.0 nowoffers an ideal move forward.andP;  Dewar would like to move over to Windows by1992, but it feels DOS is still adequate for now.andM;Just to get a feeling for what hardware users are buying these days, wechecked out Dewar's standards.andP;  It is selling all '386sx PCs with VGA, 2 MBof RAM and 40-MB hard drives as standard user workstations.andP;  At the fileserver level, 25-MHz '386 and '486 machines with 4 MB of RAM and anywherefrom 90 to 680 MB of disk space (and in some cases 1.2 GB of storage) arestandard.andP;  Each year we seem to ratchet up to the next level of machine!andM;Dewar has been a complete PC shop ever since it decided to go &quot;standard&quot; andoff-the-shelf.andP;  But we did notice a Mac in the booth for the first time.andP;  Ithas bridged into the Novell Netware 286 LAN, which enables scanned art andlogos to be passed into the system.andP;  Future applications for the Mac could bedisplay ad and pagination--but we got no comment on this front from Dewar.andM;Down a cul-de-sac.andP;  One area Dewar is spending a great deal of time on is thetranslation of PICT and PostScript files into bitmaps in order to driveconventional typesetters with graphics.andP;  On the surface this makes Dewar anice guy in the customers' eyes, allowing newspapers to get more from theirtypesetters than they were designed to do.andP;  But we feel users are going tolose in the long run on this one.andP;  The hundreds of hours Dewar is spending ontrying to get conventional typesetters to output PostScript files could bebetter spent developing new products.andP;  Dewar agrees, but feels it is beingpressured by customers and is now boxed into a corner.andM;If users want to output PostScript files and other graphics that are moresuited to PostScript typesetters, they should buy PostScript typesetters.andO;The industry has a long history of pressuring vendors (and vendors have along history of not saying no).andP;  In almost every instance of significant workto get more out of inappropriate older technology, both the user and thevendor have eventually lost.andP;  Users and vendors alike share in theresponsibility to keep vendors on track, developing products that willbenefit the industry as a whole.andP;  Sometimes vendors hear wants instead ofneeds, and sometimes newspapers must also be aware of this difference.andM;Harris has class pagination, picture deskandM;Harris showed two new products: classified pagination software forthe 8900system, and its new picture desk running on the Sun Sparcstation platform.andO;Classified pagination runs only on the 8900; it will not be available on the8300.andP;  It takes as input the classified dump that would normally go to thetypesetter.andP;  This can be from a Harris system or from any other system thatcan be interfaced.andP;  The picture desk is discussed on page 34.andM;Classified pagination.andP;  The classified pagination software cohabitates withthe editorial pagination software on the 8900.andP;  This means that one terminalcan be used to build both classified and editorial on the same page--a majorbenefit.andP;  The system uses the new color monitor that is now available on the8900; in this application, it is used to show different ad classifications,headers, and special ad positions.andM;This software offers several modes of operation: back fill, where pages arefilled from the end of a section; front fill, from the start of a section;and top or bottom fill on a page.andM;The system allows classification headers to be regenerated (or not) at thehead of columns.andP;  It can also generate column fillers, which can he at thetop or bottom of columns or scattered within the column.andP;  One can bring inbanner ads with graphics and can call in graphics (logos) within an ad.andM;In page assembly, a page or pages are flowed according to the paginationalgorithm, and then one can move elements as required.andP;  One can applyvertical justification between ads and handle squaring off of columns over apage.andP;  Rule generation between columns, and where appropriate between ads,can be automatic, and one can define specific rules according to eachclassification.andP;  The system can have a controllable look forward sequence toskip ahead a definable number of ads in order to find an ad that can fit in aspecific space.andM;Page layouts are shown by the use of boxes that indicate the size of each ad.andO;One can quickly use the 8900's standard WYSIWYG function to view the page infinished form.andP;  The system is currently being used at the Quad City Times inDavenport, Iowa, which has a Harris classified system.andM;PostScript driver for 8300/8900.andP;  Harris has finally announced thelong-awaited PostScript output from the 8300/8900, which was demonstrated atANPA with output to a BirmySetter.andP;  It costs $10,000 for the 8300 and $5,000for the 8900.andM;Hell IPS builds name in U.S.andM;Following last year's decision not to come to ANPA, this year Hell'sInformation and Publishing Systems division returned.andP;  It had a major job todo because the industry consensus was that Hell was no longer a vendor to theU.S.andP;  newspaper market.andP;  Many newspapers we spoke to had bought systems inthe past year, and all indicated that they had not spoken with Hell as theyno longer believed it to be a player in the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  The company's mainobjective was therefore to show that it was a creditable supplier for themarket and had viable products for the U.S.andP;  newspaper industry.andM;Hell showed a number of products we were used to seeing in Europe, includingthe DC 3000 scanner and the Chromacom 2000 system.andP;  We were surprised that itdidn't show the Chromacom 1000, which is more suited for newspapers but notas fully functional as the Chromacom 2000 in areas of image manipulation.andO;Hell said it brought the 2000 to show it had functionality equivalent to orbetter than Scitex's.andP;  PostScript input was from the ScriptMaster using OPIextensions.andM;We also saw the AP Leaf picture desk connected to the Chromacom system via aPC-based interface using ChromaLink.andP;  The BridgIt typesetter was also beingshown for the first time in the U.S.andP;  Also on the relatively small stand wasa Pressfax facsimile system, plus an IP100 RIP.andM;AdOne under Motif.andP;  The product we wanted to look at was the AdOne display adsystem we had seen at Drupa.andP;  It was being shown in its new format mode,where it will have a Motif interface structure.andP;  This interface is notdeliverable yet, but the structure looks well executed and easy to use.andP;  Thetext editor with it is the standard Motif editor.andM;The system now also supports process and spot color images and graphicelements.andP;  It will support all the functions currently available on thenon-Motif system plus some new ones.andM;Attention Xenotron users.andP;  One element that was not shown but was outlined tous was the development of the ad database that was introduced by Xenotron andis used at many old Xenotron sites in the U.S.andP;  The new database is a Unixsystem using the Ingres relational database; it runs on the DEC Vax and onSun hardware.andP;  With a new Motif user interface, this conversion of thefunctionality of the old Xenotron system onto a modern database shouldprovide a much improved operational structure.andP;  The system can be called fromwithin AdOne and can link up with PCs and Macs to manage all the ad elements.andO;The ad database system is still under development, but it should be availableby the end of the year.andM;Triple--I adds TECS/2 modulesandM;Apart from its Concept agreement (see Concept), Triple--I had news on severalother fronts.andP;  It has sold a facsimile system, its first in the U.S., to thedaily sports newspaper The Nationa.andP;  We covered The National's developmentearlier this year (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  11); what we saw at Triple--I implied achange from remote imagesetting to facsimile transmission from a centralsite.andM;Working with Scitex, Cybergraphic.andP;  One of the five largest orders inTriple--I's history, the configuration at The National will be worth morethan $4.2 million, with plans for remote output to 20 printing sitesthroughout the U.S.andP;  The order comprises two 3750/C InfoScan Laser Scannerswith page component scanning into the pagination system and full-pagescanning in facsimile mode, plus 20 3800/F InfoFax Laser Pagesetters withfull color recording.andP;  One Pagesetter will be installed at every productionsite in the country.andP;  The National's central print plant in New York willhave a Triple--I 3810 Laser Pagesetter with its own RIP plus a separate RIPdriving a full-page VideoPrint proofer.andP;  These two RIPs will be used toprovide raster images for the Ricoh Telepress network to the remote sites.andO;The remainder of the order is for two Sun-based Image Network Processors(INPs) for graphic database management and a Graphics Gateway that interfaceswith the existing Cybergraphic, Scitex and Macintosh systems.andM;From what we can see, the Triple-I system will operate in conjunction withthe Scitex and Cybergraphic systems.andP;  For expanding the network beyond thethree sites in operation at present, the Scitex Raystar separation outputwill be scanned into the 3750 InfoScan scanner and sent via the RicohTelepress network to the 3810 InfoFax recorders at the remote sites.andP;  Itappears that monochrome pages will be sent from the Cybergraphic system intothe INPs in Triple-I's PII code for subsequent output on the 3810 Pagesetterfor facsimile scanning, or for rasterizing into the Ricoh network via theTriple-I RIPs.andM;We do not know whether Scitex pages will be rasterized into the network inthe same way or whether the Gateway link to Scitex is just for handling someimages.andP;  We were advised that the InfoFax units had new facilities to providedynamic thresholding in their optics to compensate for dot size and shape togive a true dot structure, and to allow for dot gain on the press.andM;Editor's Page Planner goes beta.andP;  We saw the Editor's Page Planner system forlayout-driven pagination on the TECS/2 system in early stages last year.andO;Finally going into beta in August, it now strikes us as an impressive systemwith a good single-screen user interface.andP;  The program runs under the IBMVM386 operating system, but an MS-DOS machine can run under that system, sothe same terminal can be used for both page layout and tat editing.andP;  VM386was chosen for its speed and transparency in switching between tasks.andM;After the page plan is made up, a page geometry file is created that isaccessed by the TECS/2 editor throughout the network.andP;  The system is dividedinto two separate elements.andP;  The first of these is the Layout Editor, whichsells for $3,000 and is used by all editorial staff working on page planning.andO;The conversion of this layout into story and page geometry requires aseparate $10,000 piece of software; however, only one copy of this program isneeded on a network.andP;  It includes a link to Layout 8000 to take advertisingdummies.andP;  The page geometry is according to Collier Jackson definitions.andM;Editorial Index tracks data.andP;  A further piece of software that has finallyarrived for TECS/2 is Editorial Index, a running index of every file on thenetwork.andP;  In a TECS/2 system, there is no central database; instead, allfiles are duplicated on another PC on the network.andP;  This process is veryfast, but it has been limited by the lack of a database-like facility to findout exactly what is in the system.andM;Editorial Index, which was first defined in our article about the Morrissystem before Triple-I began marketing it (see Vol.andP;  16, No.andP;  2), keepsinformation about every item, but not the actual item.andP;  One can have variousselection criteria, and the index can contain up to 999 characters for quickreference in read-only mode.andP;  One can define exactly what information issaved in the index from each user.andM;Editorial Index resides on a separate PC on the TECS/2 network.andP;  The softwarecosts $3,000.andM;Also new: Publications Archive.andP;  A further new facility for TECS/2 is thePublications Archive.andP;  This self-indexing system produces a full archive ofall words of four or more characters, plus specifically defined three letterwords, for retrieval from any terminal on the network.andP;  A foreign systeminterface enables it to import data from Atex, SII and Camex (Crosfield CSI).andM;The addition of these software modules goes a long way toward completing theTECS/2 system for editorial purposes.andP;  There is still no interactive WYSIWYGpage editor with graphics handling on a PC structure, but we may see one whenConcept's products are incorporated.andM;SCS flush with successandM;Software Consulting Services came to the show, fresh off its successfulinstallation at the Canadian French paper LeDroit, which is doing fullpagination, text, ads, graphics and color with the help of Quark Xtensionswritten by SCS (see our case study of LeDroit in our last issue).andP;  SCScharacterizes itself as a company that is producing newspapers rather thantalking about them.andP;  With its focus exclusively on newspapers, SCS believesit has more modules for newspaper production, billing and circulation thananyone else in the market.andP;  Good or bad, all its eggs are in this singlebasket, which SCS feels is to its advantage.andM;At the show, SCS demonstrated how its modules plug together to form acohesive and productive system.andP;  Its ANPA theme was the attainment of itsgoal to provide &quot;all&quot; the pieces--a target established several years ago.andO;SCS now has four sites with this complete suite of products.andP;  A strength ofits system remains the single user environment and messaging facilities thatmake the system look like a single unit.andM;Stressing its willingness to use outside software, subsystems (such asPongrass for classified pagination, Multi-Ad for display ad makeup and QuarkXpress for page makeup) and system integrators, SCS hosted Systemhouse (anOttawa system integrator) in its booth to show what Systemhouse has done forLeDroit.andM;While we were in the SCS booth, we noticed a lack of DEC hardware; this is abit unusual for a company that has done most of its development on DECequipment.andP;  SCS will still sell DEC gear for anyone demanding it, but it willno longer be tied exclusively to DEC.andP;  It seems that the prior dependency onDEC forced SCS to pass on what it considered &quot;unrealistically high softwarelicense fees&quot; to its customers as DEC arbitrarily raised its prices.andP;  Fromnow on, it will stay with the generic hardware platforms (clone '386 PCs forthe most part) that offer the best price/performance ratio available.andP;  SCSfeels there are no longer any newspaper applications for which DEC can offera more cost-effective solution than a '386 PC or other platform.andP;  One moreloss for DEC.andM;SII completes Mac tie-inandM;For those who thought System Integrators was leaving the business a few yearsago when Lennane chose a small 10X20 booth, ANPA '90 was quite a change.andO;SII's booth looked like a football stadium with 30-foot foot walls andmassive open space--easily enough room to accommodate its partners DTI andPongrass.andP;  In fact, it was awarded a first-place prize in the ANPA boothcontest.andM;Mac 55.andP;  The focus SII's booth was on the completion of the integration ofthe Mac-based DTI display ad system with the Tandem host.andP;  This configurationis now called the Mac 55.andP;  It ties the DTI AdSpeed to the Tandem in a wayseamless to the user.andP;  On her Mac screen the user sees the Tandem as justanother disk--another icon on her desktop.andP;  She can open the Tandem disk,copy files to and from it, and work from it just as if it were an internalMac drive.andM;SII has mapped folders to baskets, so users see SII's traditional basketdirectories as Mac folders as well.andP;  On top of this, SII added the standardSII logon and security checks (complete with user profiles) as well as full&quot;mail messaging&quot; (see photo).andP;  Messages may be sent from the Macs to anyCoyote or PC connected to the system and vice versa.andM;As a storage device, the Tandem allows text files entered via any terminalconnected to the hosts to be temporarily stored and called up on Macs usingAdSpeed for display ad makeup.andP;  Graphics are entered by scanning them intothe Tandems for inclusion within display ads.andP;  Completed ads are stored onthe Tandems and spooled for output to typesetters or proofing devices.andP;  Adsmay also be stored in their native reprocessible format as well as in PICTand TIFF formats to be included and displayed respectively on news pages (aspart of SII's pagination scheme).andM;It appears that the Mac-Tandem integration phase of the project is nowcomplete.andP;  A couple of other tasks have yet to be finished.andP;  First is theability to store ads and convert them into a PostScript format as abackground task.andP;  Currently these are foreground tasks, which means that theMac is tied up for the full time these operations take place.andP;  Second is theneed for a true database.andP;  Today there is nothing in the system toautomatically tie together all the components of an ad (text, scannedgraphics, logos etc.) in a folder, envelope or &quot;job jacket&quot; concept.andP;  Thefollow-up to this is the management of these pieces as individual componentsand as parts of an ad, so, for example, when an ad is deleted or archived,all components of the ad are treated as one entity.andM;Progress was also evident on several other fronts.andP;  SII will offer its ImageBuilder (originating from the DTI alliance) as an all-encompassing imagecapture, manipulation and storage system.andP;  Graphics from scanners, wireservices, still cameras and other sources will be brought into a singlesystem and made available to a single suite of image manipulation software,regardless of their original source.andM;Pagination is one step closer now that SII has integrated its spacereservation software with its INL software.andP;  Santa Rose, its beta site forpagination, is producing about 75 pages per week (currently just text andrules--no graphics).andP;  In a related story, together with DTI, SII has decidednot to continue offering the Hyphen typesetters.andP;  (See our coverage of DTIand Agfa.)andM;Pongrass shows classified pagination.andP;  In the Digital Technology booth (whichwas contained within the gigantic System Integrators booth) was theAustralian vendor Pongrass.andP;  It was showing the latest release of itsClassified Pagination system, which we saw recently at the LeDroit newspaperin Ottawa, Canada (see our last issue for more details).andP;  More features havebeen added to the system, such as filler and house ad menus to facilitate thepagination process.andP;  It can also now import PostScript typeset copy andpaginate the results.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
