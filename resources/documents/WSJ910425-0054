Mr. Chang, a 62-year-old veteran politician who had heldthe cabinet post since June 1989, declined to comment. Heresigned after meeting the Taipei District Court prosecutor,who subpoenaed him -- a first for a cabinet official in threedecades -- to explain his possible involvement in a HualonGroup unit's sale of stock in the unlisted Kuo Hua LifeInsurance Co. for 600 million New Taiwan dollars (US$22.3million). The buyers: Mr. Chang's daughter, a TamkiangUniversity official; and an associate professor at theuniversity, which Mr. Chang owns.   Opposition parties and others complained because the twopaid about NT$120 a share for stock said to be valued atabout NT$1,000 a share.   No charges have been brought in the case. Mr. Chang'sdeparture and the probe that prompted it mark a new stage inTaiwan's effort to come to grips with cozy business-politicalrelationships.                                                                                                          PRESTIGIOUS JAPAN PRIZE AWARDED                                                                                                          A U.S. doctor and a French mathematician each received theJapan Prize, the country's highest award for contributionsbenefiting mankind, and 50 million yen ($363,350) from theScience and Technology Foundation of Japan. Dr. John J. Wild,76, of Minneapolis, was cited for his ultrasound, or echo,imaging applications in medical diagnosis. Jacques-LouisLions of the College de France in Paris, and president ofFrance's National Center of Space Studies, was honored forresearch in applied mathematics.                                                                                                          IS IT BLEAK HOUSE FOR BRITAIN?                                                                                                          Britain's chambers of commerce found woe in short-termeconomic prospects, only a week ahead of local elections thatwill be crucial to the timing of the next general election.Their report based on a poll of more than 7,000 companiespredicts recession will continue to breed job losses andbusiness failures into the summer. In the first quarter, itstates, Britain's service sector followed manufacturing into&quot;serious decline,&quot; with no improvement seen in the currentquarter.                                                                                                          CHINA TO BOOST FOOD PRICES                                                                                                          Chinese consumers, who already spend much of their meagerincomes for food, face big price rises for grains and cookingoil next Wednesday, as part of an official effort to curbwaste. The price increase for products such as wheat andrice, which are heavily subsidized, is the first in 25 years,as Beijing seeks to trim a budget deficit amid climbinginflation. China long has held prices artificially low toprevent social unrest.

KOREAN ATONES FOR POLLUTION                                                                                                          The South Korean conglomerate Doosan Group's chairman,Park Yong Kon, 59 years old, resigned to take responsibilityfor pollution incidents.

Land prices also affect trade, as foreigners complain highrents make doing business in Japan prohibitively expensive.Property prices continued to rise at an annual rate of nearly20% after adoption last year of higher land inheritance taxesand new capital gains taxes that included levies on profitsfrom land transactions.   The new tax, to take effect Jan. 1, will make it moreexpensive to hold land in expectation of future price risesand profits. Land used by the owners for residential purposesor farming, or for hospitals, schools and other publicpurposes, won't be taxed. The new tax is set at 0.3% of theproperty's assessed value.
