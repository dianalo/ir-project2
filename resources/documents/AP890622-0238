(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of a radical group set anAmerican flag afire Thursday, a day after the U.S. Supreme Courtaffirmed their right to do so.   Outside the University of California at Berkeley, members of agroup called the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade called theburning of the national banner ``a celebration'' and referred to theflag and the United States in profane terms.   Elsewhere, however, congressmen and New York's mayor decried thehigh court's ruling that burning the flag was protected by the rightto free speech. In Alabama, military veterans reacted with shock anddismay.   The high court on Wednesday ruled 5-4 in favor of Gregory``Joey'' Johnson, who torched the flag during a protest at the 1984Republican Convention in Dallas. He appealed a one-year sentence anda $2,000 fine.   The decision of the Supreme Court knocked down anti-flagdesecration laws in 48 states.   In Washington, D.C., Sen. Pete Wilson, introduced a jointresolution that proposed a constitutional amendment ``to protect thedignity of the U.S. flag.''   The Bill of Rights, whose first article protects freedom ofspeech, ``should not imply the right to desecrate the flag,'' saidWilson, a Republican from California.   New York's Mayor Edward Koch also said that the Constitutionshould be amended to prohibit such political expression.   ``We were shocked that the law of the country now is that you canburn a flag with impunity,'' he said.   In Montgomery, Ala., Gordon Shewmake, state adjutantquartermaster of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he didn'tunderstand why anyone would want to burn the flag.   ``People have died for that piece of cloth,'' he said. ``If theydon't like our flag, they can go live under another flag and I don'tthink they'd like that at all.''   Shewmake, a 23-year Air Force veteran, said he was proud to seethe American flag while serving overseas during the occupation ofJapan after World War II and in Korea and Vietnam.   But a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabamasaid the decision correctly interpreted the First Amendmentguarantee of free speech.   Martin McCaffrey, vice president of the state Civil LibertiesUnion board of directors, said the decision was not an issue ofpatriotism but of civil rights.   ``The same First Amendment that protects your right to wave theflag protects your right to burn the flag,'' McCaffrey said.</TEXT></DOC>
