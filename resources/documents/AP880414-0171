KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservatives opened a drive against the newU.S.-Soviet arms treaty on Thursday and former Defense SecretaryCaspar W. Weinberger said he had no reason to believe the pact bansfuturistic weapons such as lasers.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., vowed once morenot to call up the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty fordebate on the Senate floor until the futuristic weapons issue iscleared up.   The Senate Armed Services Committee convened a secret session todiscuss the issue, which Byrd has said may represent ``a hole inthe treaty.''   Although there has been pressure on the Senate to complete workon the pact before President Reagan leaves for his Moscow summitmeeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in late May, Byrdtold reporters: ``I'm not driven by a calendar deadline. I wantfirst, last and always to have a good treaty.''   The treaty makes no specific mention of futuristic weapons suchas lasers or particle beam generators that may be used in a U.S.Star Wars defense, but Reagan administration negotiators have saidthe Soviet Union understands the treaty does bar the possession orflight testing of all medium-range weapons, no matter how they arearmed or operate.   Weinberger, in a letter, told Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind.: ``Ican simply state that there was no understanding of any kind that Iknew about that the treaty covered anything related to theseso-called futuristic weapons.''   A similar letter was received from Kenneth Adelman, former headof the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.   Weinberger said: ``Certainly, there was no discussion orevaluation of the military sufficiency questions involved inbanning futuristic weaponry that I ever participated in, and Inever heard any others having such a discussion.''   He said it was his clear understanding U.S. negotiators weretalking only about existing types of medium-range ballistic orcruise missiles.   ``Indeed, had their been any suggestions that `futuristic'weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongestpossible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effecton (the Strategic Defense Initiative) for us to agree to anylimitation on any systems not yet designed or `futuristic'systems,'' Weinberger said.   He said such a ban also would heve enabled the Soviets ``toargue that they have finally succeeded in making our SDI effortsineffective.''   Adelman also said he was never aware of a ban on futuristicweapons ever being discussed in any National Security Councilmeeting he attended or in ``any meeting with Soviet officials withwhich I am familiar.''   Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus,announced the opening of a nationwide campaign to defeat the treatyor to delay Senate consent to its ratification.   Treaty supporters have said they can count only a handful ofsenators firmly committed to vote against the pact. Ratificationrequires a two-thirds vote, 67 senators if all 100 are present.   Phillips told reporters that black umbrellas emblazoned withanti-treaty slogans would be delivered to the offices of all 100senators to symbolize the beginning of a campaign in which he saidorganizers would attempt to rally public opinion against the pact.   In a letter accompanying the umbrellas, Phillips gave thisexplanation:   ``Open, the unbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, formore than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination andintimidation of Europe.   ``Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit ofappeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized (BritishPrime Minister) Neville Chamberlain's dealings with Adolph Hitlerat Munich precisely 50 years ago.''   Phillips said conservative groups would purchase television timeto present a 30-minute film attacking the treaty and were sendingletters to 250,000 conservative activists to begin a grassrootscampaign.   The INF treaty requires the destruction of all U.S. and Sovietmissiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.   The U.S. force of Pershing 2 ballistic missiles andground-launched cruise missiles was deployed several years ago tocounter the Soviet deployment of medium-range SS-20 missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
