The sporangium wall is invariably composed of a singlelayer of thin-walled cells filled with resinite. In better preservedtissues the wall is enveloped by a massive tissue composed of relativelythick-walled cells. The sporangium wall, being highly resistant to decay,has survived in the form of a collapsed ring showing resin globules arrangedlike beads in a chain. At places, the globules are coalesced and forma smooth band or are partially fused along their contacts. The resinglobules have undergone varying degrees of coalification as is indicatedby progressive darkening of their body colour in transmitted light. Withfurther coalification, the resin bodies appear opaque but the chain-likearrangement or the coalescence of the resin globules is still discernible.Such features have been used while identifying fusinized resin bodiesin the Raniganj coals. The origin of the discrete objects and fragmentaryparts of certain tissues has been revealed through microscopic examination.Round to oval or irregularly shaped fusinized resin bodies showing smooth,vesicled and canalled surfaces have been observed still embedded in theirparent tissues. Likewise, the discrete opaque objects and minute fragmentsof tissues have been assigned to their proper parentage. Structures observedin reflected light, comparable to those of the sporangia in transmittedlight, very strongly suggest that they are remnants of highly decomposedsporangium bodies preserved in a fusinized state. Fungal structure ofany type was not noticed during the course of the present microscopicinvestigation. It, therefore, appears that favourable conditions to supportfungal population did probably not exist in areas of coal depositionin the Raniganj coalfield. 30 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
