The Houston oil and gas exploration and production concern said $7.7 million is to be used on costs of the 34 wells, and the remainder may be used to drill additional wells at other locations. Interest rate on the loans is 9% while the loan is outstanding, with royalties to be paid after the loan is repaid, Wainoco said. The loan is secured solely by the wells to be drilled and will be repaid partly by the operating profit of the wells. </TEXT></DOC>
