As chairman of Italy's second-largest clothing maker, Gruppo Finanziaria Tessile S.p.A., he was one of the first to find out. GFT prospered in the past 10 years by making collections for about 60 designers, including Valentino, Christian Dior and Emanuel Ungaro. Their clothes were especially popular in the U.S.; a strong dollar and an appetite for Italian clothes by North Americans brought GFT 25% of its 990 billion lire ($706.2 million) total sales in 1987.    But last year, sales growth slowed substantially to 10% and net profit fell 5%. Hurt by U.S. customers' falling interest in high fashion, by a stronger lira and by cheaper, more efficiently produced German copies of Italian designs, GFT's boom had ended. Things aren't looking much brighter this year, Mr. Rivetti says, predicting sales growth of 16% to 1.15 trillion lire and slightly lower profit margins.    GFT's problems reflect those of other Italian exporters that depend heavily on the U.S.; indeed, it is faring better than average. Last year, the Italian clothing industry association says, exports of Italian clothes to the U.S. dropped 1.2% to 735 billion lire. This comes after a steep 5% drop in 1986, when the dollar was plunging. GFT has little room left to grow in that sector, since its U.S. exports in 1987 were more than a third of Italian industry's total.    In the past year, German exporters surpassed the Italians in sales volume. Meanwhile, demand slowed in the U.S., where Italian clothes have become too expensive, and sometimes too trendy, for a significant part of the market.    GFT, which still accounts for 48% of the European-style men's suits sold in North America, is taking heed of these changes.    GFT has created joint ventures with a series of American designers, including Joan andamp; David, Joseph Abboud and Andrew Fezza. It also is trying to improve logistics and make production more efficient to compete better with German counterparts.    It's setting up manufacturing in local markets with local designers, including some lower-priced lines, instead of concentrating mainly on making clothes in Italy for export. It's trying to reinforce its traditional links with top designers by setting up joint ventures rather than short-term licensing agreements. And it's looking to new markets, such as the Soviet Union and China, where potential is huge but initial investment can be small.    Founded in 1868 as a maker of ready-to-wear clothing, GFT by 1987 made 60 different lines of clothes, including some of its own design, which it distributes in 70 countries. Its 13 plants in Italy are supported by manufacturing in the U.S., Mexico, France and China.    With growth slowing, Mr. Rivetti is investing 30 billion lire over the next two years on a new internal communications system to improve delivery of products and better control order flow. Last year, he formed a joint venture with Benetton S.p.A., Italy's largest clothing maker, to study ways of improving delivery and other logistics of clothes production.    GFT is trying to re-create Italian flexibility at plants around the world and to diversify its products to meet different national tastes.    In addition, GFT has begun putting its logo on ads for the designer clothing it makes, sponsoring art exhibits and shows, and displaying its name more prominently, alongside the designer's, on price tags on the garments themselves.    &quot;Eventually, we'd like to become a kind of guarantee of quality for the consumer,&quot; says Mr. Rivetti. &quot;Whether he was buying Valentino or Joan andamp; David or an unknown brand, he'd know it was a quality garment, because it was made by us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
