The board of the FDIC, which would receive $500 million inthe settlement, had expected to make its decision last week,but after meeting for more than two hours Friday, decided itneeded more information, according to an agency spokesman.Individuals familiar with the meetings said that theregulators don't necessarily feel bound by today's settlementdeadline sought by U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack.</LP><TEXT>   Thomas D. Barr, one of the top lawyers at the New Yorkfirm Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, hired by regulators to handlethe suit, will travel to Washington today to answer questionsabout the proposed settlement.   Mr. Barr, whose law firm stands to earn at least $40million if the deal is approved, may have a tough timeassuaging the agency's concerns. He is expected to tell theboard that, just as in any settlement, each side is getting alittle bit of what it wants. But there may be concerns,because Mr. Milken, after paying his share of the settlement,would remain in control of as much as $500 million, including$125 million of his own, and the remainder in trusts held byhis immediate family.   Under the proposed settlement, the FDIC would receive $500million of the $1.3 billion total to compensate for losses tosavings and loans allegedly caused by manipulation of the thejunk-bond market. Other plaintiffs would get about $700million, and Drexel's fixed creditors would get slightly lessthan $100 million.   &quot;This is a hot political potato,&quot; said William Seidman,former chairman of the FDIC. Mr. Seidman said that althoughhe was disappointed that Mr. Milken would keep severalhundred million dollars, the settlement &quot;is $500 million thatthe taxpayers won't have to pay&quot; for Sandamp;L losses. &quot;If theydon't get it done fast, it could be in danger of fallingapart.&quot;   The FDIC is the last holdout among the government agenciessuing Mr. Milken and others. The Resolution Trust Corp.,which is also suing Mr. Milken, has approved the settlement,contingent upon the FDIC's approval, individuals familiarwith the settlement negotiations said. The Securities andExchange Commission, which allowed $400 million Mr. Milkenalready paid to go into the overall settlement pot, also hasapproved the deal.   A spokesman for the FDIC wouldn't say what information theagency requested, but according to people familiar with thenegotiations, the agency wants its lawyers to explain why theMilken family trusts, which were sued but have been left outof the settlement, wouldn't be required to contribute. Andthe agency is asking for more information about the amountsbeing contributed by each of Mr. Milken's co-defendants,which include his brother Lowell. So far, Mr. Milken's sidehas refused to disclose the specific amounts paid by eachperson to the FDIC.   Bank regulators also are concerned about how thesettlement might influence the Internal Revenue Service indeciding whether Mr. Milken has to pay capital-gains tax onthe securities he sells to raise money for the deal.   Even though the FDIC delayed its decision, Judge Pollack,who has ordered lawyers to keep mum about the negotiations,felt confident enough of the settlement that he allowedDrexel's lawyers to disclose the terms in a public briefinglast week.   Under the settlement, Mr. Milken would contribute $900million, including $400 million from the SEC settlement. Anadditional $300 million would come from the interests ofabout 200 former Drexel employees in partnerships linked tosome of the investment bank's most prominent deals of the1980s. About $100 million would come from Drexel's liabilityinsurance.   In return, the settlement closes lawsuits alleging fraudthat were filed against Mr. Milken and others by Drexelitself, thrift regulators and more than 100 groups ofinvestors. Mr. Milken is serving a 10-year prison sentencefor criminal charges related to securities fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
