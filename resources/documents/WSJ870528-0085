Their diseased hearts haven't become healthier, but many &quot;feel and act much improved,&quot; he says. &quot;More importantly,&quot; he adds, &quot;there is reason to believe some will live longer.&quot;    Dr. Gavras's patients take a new drug that is changing the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, problems that affect about 60 million Americans. It is also turning once-lackluster Squibb Corp. into a Wall Street favorite, vindicating a new approach to drug research and setting new financial and scientific targets for the competition. But it has drawn some criticism for its high cost and for Squibb's aggressive promotional efforts.    The drug is Capoten (generic name: captopril), a product that came out in 1981 but was at first sharply restricted because of serious side effects in some patients. New studies have exonerated it and shown it to be useful, without side effects, against a wider range of heart problems than first believed. In recent months, Capoten has become the first drug to help patients awaiting heart transplants to resume normal activities. In one study to be published soon, Norwegian doctors using a very similar drug prolonged the life of patients whose crippled hearts threatened imminent death.    Capoten is even surprising executives at Squibb, the Princeton, N.J., pharmaceutical company that created and markets it. They expect the drug's world-wide sales to top $700 million this year, up from $522 million last year and $295 million in 1985 -- dizzying growth for any new product. Some industry analysts think sales of Capoten and other drugs that work the same way -- so-called ACE inhibitors -- will double again in three or four years.    The blockbuster performance is transforming Squibb, with only a mediocre financial past, into a drug-industry star. Mostly because of Capoten, the company expects its profit from continuing operations to jump 35% or 40% this year from last year's $4.90 a share. Analysts expect Squibb's net income, which was $7.37 a share last year, to rise an average of 25% annually for four to six years.    The drug's commercial success is enabling Squibb to complete a corporate makeover charted by its chairman and chief executive officer, Richard M. Furlaud, more than 10 years ago. In the past year it has shed less profitable cosmetics and medical-equipment businesses, the final phase of a plan to jettison non-drug units and sculpt Squibb into a small but fast-growing drug maker. Wall Street is rewarding the effort; in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, the company's shares closed at $175, up 87 1/2 cents, about 75% higher than a year ago.    Capoten's rise has been a 23-year rollercoaster ride of brilliant science, followed by deep frustration and then, finally, a marketing coup by managers desperate to see the product triumph. Along the way the drug inspired a scientific spat among eminent cardiovascular researchers over how many patients might benefit. One thing the Capoten story shows is how &quot;medical breakthroughs,&quot; far from coming overnight, may be the product of years of experimentation, along with luck, fortitude and almost Barnum-like promotion.    Despite its success, Capoten is controversial. Costing from $400 to $700 or $800, depending on dosage, for a year's treatment, it is about twice as expensive as most other hypertension drugs and four times more costly than other heart-failure treatments. Along with another expensive new drug family -- the so-called calcium channel blockers -- it is pushing up the cost of treating hypertension.    Moreover, some cardiologists argue that Capoten and other drugs in its family may work in only about 55% of patients with hypertension, but note that Squibb promotes the drug as a first-step therapy in treating all cases of high blood pressure. Squibb concedes the drug doesn't work in all patients.    Some doctors chafe at Squibb's marketing campaigns, which over the past three years have included the promoting of new, still preliminary research about the drug to thousands of doctors at dozens of company-sponsored medical symposiums nationwide. &quot;It's a good drug, but much of its popularity is promotional,&quot; asserts Ray Gifford, the head of the Cleveland Clinic's hypertension unit. &quot;Doctors could be using less expensive medicines just as well.&quot; Says another respected cardiologist: &quot;{Squibb} is pounding heck out of the drug.&quot;    Still, there is much allure for doctors in using a totally new type of medicine. When released, Capoten was the first new drug therapy for hypertension in 15 years, and the first for heart failure in 200 years. The drug works by acting on a body mechanism that, although not fully understood, is believed so important that about a dozen drug makers are racing to produce similar products.    The drug's story goes back to the 1960s and involves the strange intersection of two lines of research, one studying the venom of the Brazilian pit viper and one seeking to understand a form of hypertension whose genesis was unknown. In the latter case, scientists had speculated for years that the kidneys, releasing a chemical called renin, regulated blood pressure, and that the mysterious hypertension might be due to some kidney foul-up.    They began to realize that renin causes blood to produce a second chemical, called angiotensin I, which in turn is converted into angiotensin II. Within seconds of its release, angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels and forcing the heart to pump harder to get fluid through the narrowed openings.    At the same time, researchers in Brazil found that the pit viper's victims die because the venom radically lowers their blood pressure. They also discovered that an extract of the venom blocked conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by interfering with an enzyme produced in the lungs.    A British pharmacologist, John R. Vane, brought these findings to Squibb, whose scientists were on the prowl for new heart medicines. They began searching for the specific chemical in the extract responsible for blocking the enzyme. It might, they figured, become the basis for a new anti-hypertensive drug. (The venom extract itself couldn't be put to use in an oral drug because it was a protein that would be destroyed by the digestive system.)    &quot;It was to be the first rational construction of a drug based on very specific knowledge of how the body works,&quot; says Charles Sanders, Squibb's executive vice president for research. Prior to this, most new drugs were discovered by screening thousands of chemicals until one worked against a disease. Nowadays, almost all drugs are made by this more rational approach.    By 1975 Squibb scientists had built, atom by atom, a molecule that mimicked the action of the viper's venom, blocking the enzyme and lowering blood pressure in animals and human beings. This chemical, called captopril, became the first inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitor.    Soon, securities analysts were predicting sales of $50 million to $200 million a year for the drug. David Paisley, a much heeded Merrill Lynch analyst, saw the figure quickly reaching $500 million.    But before the drug ever came to market, disaster struck. Experimental use in some very sick patients impaired kidney function and lowered white-blood-cell counts. In August 1980, a Food and Drug Administration committee recommended that, because of this effect, the drug be given only to patients for whom all other therapy had failed.    The panel's decision rocked Wall Street. Within two days the company's stock fell 20%, to $29.125.    At Squibb headquarters, then in New York City, the mood was ugly. As it happened, a thunderstorm was raging, the dark sky broken only by lightning flashes. &quot;We called it Black Friday,&quot; recalls one former employee. &quot;People were falling on their swords.&quot;    The news hit Squibb's Mr. Furlaud particularly hard. He had begun running the company in 1968 after engineering the spinoff of Squibb from Olin Corp., and had pumped up what was a puny drug operation with earnings from Squibb's Life Savers candy and other consumer operations. But &quot;it was my hope that one day we wouldn't need the consumer businesses, that we'd be a pure pharmaceutical business,&quot; he says. That future depended on Capoten.    Distraught, he flew to his summer home in East Hampton, N.Y., and invited Lewis Thomas, a board member and respected philosopher-scientist, to discuss the problem. Mr. Furlaud was especially upset because the FDA action meant the drug would be used only by very sick patients who the company knew were at risk of developing side effects. &quot;We were trapped,&quot; he says, because the FDA restriction &quot;forced us to market the product to those very people we felt should avoid the drug. We feared the drug would develop a bad reputation when we knew that for most people it was safer than anything else.&quot;    Dr. Thomas convinced Mr. Furlaud the drug could be salvaged through new tests in less ill patients at much lower doses. Company officials now concede they had initially blundered by testing in huge doses of up to 1,000 milligrams daily. When they later slashed that (the company now recommends about 75 mg. a day), the side effects disappeared.    So Squibb executives met with the FDA. Agency officials, Mr. Furlaud recalls, &quot;believed the drug was safe, but, as regulators, they said they needed the proof. We were in a box, so we decided to fight our way out.&quot; Over the next several years, Squibb spent $4 million testing the drug on 12,000 patients. And based on these tests, the FDA in 1985 approved Capoten against all types of hypertension.    Meanwhile, Squibb's scientists and marketers devised a plan to rehabilitate the drug's reputation by supporting research that the company could promote to physicians. &quot;Squibb was very aggressive, much more aggressive than we'd be if we had the restricted label,&quot; says Jerry T. Jackson, the senior vice president for marketing at Merck andamp; Co., which since last year has been selling a competing ACE inhibitor, Vasotec (known generically as enalapril).    Some of the research Squibb financed was undertaken to compare the drug favorably with rivals. Early studies had shown that patients using Capoten developed fewer annoying side effects, such as impotence and fatigue, than did those on certain other anti-hypertensive drugs. So Squibb financed a University of Connecticut study comparing Capoten with two other drug types.    Capoten appears to work by relaxing the vascular system, thus reducing the heart's workload and letting patients resume normal activities; some other drugs relieve cardiac stress by slowing a range of body functions, sometimes rendering normal activity difficult. The Connecticut study found that patients on Capoten tended to report a greater sense of well-being than those on the two drugs that were compared with it.    The study's findings were first presented several years ago at various medical gatherings Squibb sponsored. When they finally were published last June, in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, they generated much news coverage. Capoten sales exploded. In the following six months -- as Squibb salespeople inundated doctors with the findings -- first-time prescriptions for Capoten in the U.S. rose 54% to 300,000 a month.    Some health officials see these tactics as hype. They note, for one thing, that the Connecticut study didn't compare Capoten with diuretics, a widely used type of antihypertensive drug that has few side effects. &quot;The study was a bit of a setup,&quot; says Marvin Moser, a physician at Yale University Medical School.    The company also is eager to spread news of other findings, especially those showing the drug has attributes beyond lowering blood pressure. One such report hints that the drug may improve memory in the elderly. Another suggests it is less damaging to the fragile kidneys of diabetics who have high blood pressure and may even retard kidney damage for nonhypertensive diabetics. And, most dramatically, some aspect of the drug's chemistry may curb the severity of heart attacks among patients who have taken it.    Under FDA rules, Squibb can't tell doctors of these findings until they have been presented to the agency for approval. But the company is inviting researchers, who are paid honorariums of about $1,000, to present their findings to doctors in a series of meetings across the nation.    Last month, Squibb paid air fare, hotel and food expenses for 400 doctors for a three-day stay in San Diego. There, they heard top cardiovascular scientists present preliminary research suggesting that Capoten can prolong the life of some heart-failure patients. Among the cardiologists who attended was Ian Molk of Highland Park, N.J. &quot;I was tremendously impressed,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm going to use the drug more often.&quot;    Officials at the FDA are monitoring this promotional technique, which they say has become increasingly common. But an FDA official, Kenneth Feather, believes that &quot;the companies know it will backfire unless the drug has some benefit.&quot;    Jan Leschly, executive vice president at Squibb, explains that &quot;these days doctors are much more sophisticated. They don't want to hear a sales pitch. But if you can get respected people in their field talking about the drug, that's where the real sell takes place.&quot;    Officials of Squibb are nearly giddy with Capoten's success. At its annual meeting last month, Mr. Furlaud, who often seems somewhat distant and solemn before shareholders, was buoyant and jocular. Now the company is building a future that would be &quot;impossible without Capoten,&quot; Mr. Leschly says.    In doing so, it hopes to avoid the hazards of being too dependent on one big drug. For instance, earnings of Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. tumbled after its Valium was battered by generic competition. Squibb has some protection from such a fate because it owns the rights, acquired from Japan's Sankyo, to sell a new cholesterol-lowering drug called pravastatin, which is also expected to become a big moneymaker. (Merck has the first drug of this type, lovastatin, which is expected to get final FDA clearance in a matter of months.)    In marketing Capoten, some analysts say, Squibb may be hard-pressed to hold off Merck, whose similar drug, Vasotec, is quickly gaining on it. Vasotec needs to be taken only once daily, whereas Capoten must be taken two or three times a day.    Squibb officials know they must develop new drugs. But &quot;because of Capoten,&quot; says Mr. Leschly, &quot;we are attracting the type of personnel we never could get before, and we finally have the money to back their work.&quot;    ---   U.S. SALES FOR THREE ACE INHIBITOR DRUGS   (In millions of dollars)                      Capoten       Vasotec      Lisinopril                   (from Squibb)  (from Merck)   (to be mar-                                                 keted by                                                 Merck/ICI                                                 Americas)   1982               $ 22           xxx           xxx   1983               $ 39           xxx           xxx   1984               $ 60           xxx           xxx   1985               $105           xxx           xxx   1986               $194          $ 66           xxx   1987*              $300          $265           xxx   1988*              $350          $420          $ 76   1989*              $410          $500          $168   1990*              $445          $580          $240   1991*              $470          $630          $344   *Estimated by Sanford C.
