BEGGS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Oregon squabble over whether theconstitutional right to religious freedom can stretch far enough toallow illegal drug use will be back before the nation's highestcourt Monday.   The case that's making an unusual second trip to the U.S.Supreme Court involves religious traditions substantially olderthan the U.S. Constitution itself.   The battle began after two members of the Native American Churchwere fired as counselors at a Roseburg drug and alcohol treatmentcenter because they had used peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, inreligious ceremonies.   Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer sees unsettling implications inthe idea of giving constitutional protection to drug use. Lawyerson the other side say the existence of an ancient religion could beat stake in the case.   Peyote, also known as mescal, comes from a small cactus thatgrows in Mexico and the southwestern United States. Indians haveused it ceremonially for centuries and attribute spiritualqualities to the substance.   The drug is generally illegal. But the court case is a civil andnot a criminal action because Alfred Smith and Galen Black weredenied unemployment compensation on grounds they were dismissed formisconduct.   The Oregon Supreme Court in 1986 ruled that refusing to pay thejobless benefits violated the men's First Amendment rights to freeexercise of religion.   The state appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court last yearreturned the case to Oregon's top court with directions to addressthe criminal status of the drug under state law.   The state court again held that religious use of peyote isprotected by the Constitution although the drug is illegal by statelaw.   Frohnmayer, who planned to personally argue the state's casebefore the nation's highest tribunal, says the Oregon Supreme Courtand U.S. Supreme Court both overreached in injecting the criminaldrug law vs. religious freedom issue into the case.   As a result, he said in a recent interview, he has little ideaabout what to expect from the justices in Washington.   ``What they have in mind is somewhat baffling to all of us,'' hesaid.   Frohnmayer said he's worried about the court setting acumbersome precedent. If an exception is made for peyote, he asks,what about religions that claim they need to use marijuna or otherdrugs?   ``The concern the state has is the specter of engaging in areligion-by-religion, drug-by-drug examination,'' Frohnmayer said.``Putting the long arm of government into testing people'ssincerity is troubling.''   And Frohnmayer said the Oregon Constitution ``commands absoluteneutrality on religions.''   Smith, a Klamath Indian who lives in Eugene, says the use ofpeyote is a sacrament and that the substance is viewed as medicine.   The years-long court case is unfair, he said recently.   ``It's racism and bigotry. I'm just tired of it all,'' saidSmith, who'll turn 70 the day the case is argued.   More than 20 states and the federal government exempt religioususe of peyote from criminal sanctions. Oregon has no suchexemption, and Frohnmayer doubts if one for a particular religioncould survive the state constitution's language.   Craig Dorsay, a Portland lawyer representing Smith and Black,takes issue with Frohnmayer's reading of the constitution.   The language permits differences ``and certainly allows for anexception for the religious use of peyote,'' Dorsay said.   He said an adverse decision could severely damage and maybedestroy the Native American Church.   ``It cannot exist without the ceremonial, traditional use ofpeyote,'' he said. ``It's a central part of their main ceremony.''</TEXT></DOC>
