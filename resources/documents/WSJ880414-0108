MARTINI andamp; ROSSI.    Remy Martin, the French cognac group, raised its bid to 7,000 francs ($1,222.81) for each Benedictine share, from 6,200 francs, and increased the stake it is seeking to 100% from 60%. The new offer values Benedictine at 980 million francs ($171.2 million) based on the current number of shares, or 1.04 billion francs if Benedictine goes through with plans for a defensive capital increase.    Martini andamp; Rossi, the Swiss-controlled drinks group, is offering 6,550 francs a share for all of Benedictine, for a total value of 917 million francs or 971 million francs. Its bid gained regulatory approval earlier this week.    The Paris Stockbrokers' Association yesterday renewed its suspension of trading in Benedictine's shares. The shares, which had been scheduled to resume trading today, have been suspended since mid-January at a price of 6,100 francs.    If Martini andamp; Rossi chooses to raise its bid, it would be required to offer a price at least 5% above Remy Martin's. That would put its minimum outlay at 7,350 francs a share, for a total value between 1.03 billion francs and 1.09 billion francs. </TEXT></DOC>
