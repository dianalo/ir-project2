Ministers from eight of the 13 nations that make up theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting for talkson bringing order to the chaotic oil market.   ``There is a feeling they have to come up with a new (production)agreement,'' said one OPEC official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``They will work very hard at it because of the consequence offailure...a collapse in prices,'' he said.   The eight ministers are meeting in a joint session of two OPECcommittees, in talks that could run into the weekend. On Monday, all13 ministers are to meet for the cartel's winter meeting.   At issue is the thorny problem of how to address the cartel'srecently skyrocketing output, which has added to an already gluttedworld market. Analysts say most OPEC members have exceeded theirproduction quotas, partly to press for position in advance of theVienna meetings.   As a result, prices have slipped $4 or more below OPEC'sbenchmark price of $18 a barrel. A barrel is equivalent to 42gallons.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell23 cents Wednesday to settle at $13.67 a barrel, after falling 37cents on Tuesday.   The recent declines reflect how dramatically OPEC production hasrisen.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that OPEC production was nearly 21.1 million barrels aday in October, the highest monthly output in more than five years.   OPEC's official total production quota under a December 1986arrangement is about 15 million barrels a day. That excludes Iraq,which has ignored its limit.   Nick Antill, oil analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,estimated next year's demand for OPEC oil at 18.7 million barrels aday.   Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates in Paris, speculated that a new accord might set totaloutput at 19 million to 19.5 million barrels a day.   A key to a new quota agreement is bringing Iraq back into thesystem.   Saudi Arabia _ the world's largest oil exporter and OPEC's mostinfluential member _ and Kuwait have insisted that a fresh accordmust include all members.   Saudi Arabia recently increased its production to more than 6million barrels a day, well above its ceiling of 4.3 millionbarrels, in an attempt to pressure other cartel members to obeytheir quotas.   Iraq has refused to obey its daily ceiling of 1.5 million barrelsbecause it wanted parity with war rival Iran, which has a quota of2.4 million barrels.   The two countries agreed to an August cease-fire in their8-year-old war, and both want to earn more oil revenue to pay forrebuilding their war-ravaged economies.   Analysts estimated Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 millionbarrels a day, and could boost production to 3.7 million barrelsnext year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia tothe Red Sea.   Under a new system, Iran and Iraq might each get a quota of 2.6million barrels, analysts predicted.   OPEC ministers also must deal with the United Arab Emirates'refusal to stick to its quota of 948,000 million barrels a day. Itindependently has boosted its limit to 1.5 million barrels.   OPEC's price evolution committee, meeting Thursday with thelong-term strategy panel, is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela. The strategy committee's membersare Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Venezuela.   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and theUnited Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
