The armed forces press office said in a statement that thecease-fire would begin at midnight Tuesday (1 a.m. Wednesday EST)and run through June 1, when President Jose Napoleon Duarte's termin office ends.   It asked the guerrillas to reciprocate ``to comply with theSalvadoran people's desire to peace.'' It did not say whether thearmed forces would abide by the cease-fire if the guerrillas kept uptheir military attacks.   No immediate response to the announcement came from the rebels'Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN. The governmenthad no comment on the announcement.   Political party leaders said late Tuesday they were stillstudying the move by the armed forces.   The gesture came after the five Farabundo Marti commanders saidin a communique that they were willing to discuss peace with Duartebut rejected the venue and agenda he suggested Sunday night.   It said the FMLN ``sees as positive Duarte's willingness to holdtalks among the government, our front and the political parties.''   But it also lamented Duarte's ``invariable design to obtain oursurrender, which is unrealistic, illogical and impossible.''   ``This design is made very clear by his suggestion of a closedagenda that does not take into account our proposals,'' it said.   It was unclear Tuesday if the conflicting positions could bereconciled. Both stemmed from a Jan. 24 guerrilla peace overturethat called for postponing the presidential election now scheduledfor March 19.   In addition, the executive branch and the opposition-controlledlegislature were at odds over how to respond to the rebels. The FMLNhas said lawmakers should be part of any peace talks.   In a separate development, the insurgents announced they havesuspended the use of car-bombs in heavily populated areas because ofthe danger to civilians.   Duarte had proposed that the government and the rebels eachdeclare a three-month cease-fire beginning Tuesday and that peacetalks start the same day in Guatemala.   The rebels rejected the venue, saying talks should be ``among andin full view of all Salvadorans'' on Saturday and Sunday in SanSalvador.   The insurgents also balked at a long, unilateral cease-fire. Theysaid they were ready for a cease-fire during the talks but a lastingtruce should be part of the negotiations.   Duarte said Sunday the cease-fire should be in place beforenegotiations begin.   He said the talks would cover the definitive end of the war;incorporating of the FMLN into the political mainstream and rebelrecognition of the government armed forces as El Salvador's onlylegitimate military institution.   The guerrilla agenda, reiterated Tuesday, includes reducing thearmed forces from their current level of 56,000 to the pre-warstrength of 12,000.   They also repeated their demand that the three separate policeforces be disbanded and a single, civilian-controlled police forcebe established.   Military officers responsible for gross violations of humanrights must be tried and punished, the guerrillas said.   Despite civilian rule, the army remains the country's mostpowerful institution. The rebel demands regarding the armed forcesare considered major, perhaps insurmountable, stumbling blocks.   A 9-year-old civil war has ravaged this Massachusetts-sizedcountry of 5 million people. An estimated 70,000 people have beenkilled, and between 500,000 and 1 million people displaced.   Washington has provided El Salvador with more than $3.5 billionin economic and military assistance this decade.   The State Department called Duarte's address ``the mostsignificant opportunity ever'' for achieving peace.   But prospects for the main guerrilla demand _ postponing thepresidential election _ remained slim. The rebels say they wouldparticipate in and respect the outcome of the vote if it were putoff several months.   They have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous fivenational elections this decade.   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, whichcontrols the legislature and is favored to win the presidentialelection, has opposed any postponement of the vote.   The legislature has also given no indication it would take partin talks with the rebels.   Duarte's Sunday proposal has the support of the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
