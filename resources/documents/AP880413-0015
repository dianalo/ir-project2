KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wide-open race for the Senate's topDemocratic leadership post is developing in the wake of MajorityLeader Robert C. Byrd's decision to step aside after a decade ashis party's chief Senate strategist.   Three senators immediately announced their intentions tocampaign to succeed the West Virginia Democrat.   Byrd, 70, announced on Tuesday that he will seek election to asixth Senate term and, if he wins and his party retains Senatecontrol, use his seniority to claim the chairmanship of the SenateAppropriations Committee.   ``There is much to accomplish for my state in that capacity,''Byrd said.   Many in the chamber praised the work Byrd has done as Democraticleader since 1977, noting his widely acknowledged mastery of thelegislative process, but a number of Democrats also agreed it wastime for a change. Byrd in recent years has been criticized by someDemocrats for his leadership style and for lacking a slicktelevision image.   With the retirement of other senior Democrats this year, Byrdwill become his party's most senior member and serve as thechamber's president pro tem if Democrats retain majority control.   ``I believe I have been fair, firm and honest, and I have donemy best,'' Byrd told his fellow Democrats. ``Through a decade ofquiet labor I have led my party from the ambivalence of the Carteryears through the extremes of the Reagan administration.''   Announcing their candidacies for the leadership post, to bedecided after the November elections, were Sens. George Mitchell,D-Maine; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; and J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.   Several senators said there is no clear front-runner.   Inouye, who holds the Democrats' No. 3 leadership position, saidhis prospects are ``very good'' despite criticism that whileserving as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra committee last summerhe permitted Lt. Col. Oliver L. North to steal the show.   Johnston, who challenged Byrd in 1986 but dropped out when itbecame clear he could not win, said he is ``very encouraged'' eventhough he does not yet have enough votes to win.   ``No one does,'' Johnston said.   The majority leader of the Senate is the controlling party'schief strategist and spokesman and Johnston called the job ``anopportunity without parallel.''   Despite grumbling about his image, Byrd told reporters he hadgreat confidence he could have won because ``I know where the votesare.''   But according to congressional sources, Byrd had told somesenators in 1986 that if they supported him for the post then, hewould step aside when the two-year term expired.   Byrd said he had agonized over the decision until the lastmoment, not making up his mind until late Monday night.   He told his colleagues he had tried to give the Senate a voiceof ``resonance and power'' in the nation's affairs.   Many senators said they believed he had accomplished that.   But many also said they thought it was time for a change.   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., told reporters the likelihood ofByrd's running again ``seemed to fade over the past year.''   At the moment, Melcher added, there is ``no clear indication ofwho might be first, or second or even last.''   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said: ``The time for change Ithink is appropriate.''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Byrd made himself``the grand master of Senate rules and procedure.''   ``He is one tough ball carrier for his party,'' Dole said.   Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee,said that when Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 1980,Byrd ``helped fashion and execute a legislative strategy thatmoderated the excesses of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and theradical right.''   Since he first entered the Senate 30 years ago, Byrd forged areputation as a courtly master parliamentarian who revered theSenate and its history and gained power inch by inch by attendingto his colleagues' smallest wishes.   He called in those favors in 1971, ousting Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., from the No. 2 party post. Byrd succeeded Sen.Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., as majority leader in 1977.</TEXT></DOC>
