Angrist   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/05/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C12</SO><IN>COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)PETROLEUM (PET)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)</IN><LP>   Gold staged a pre-holiday rally Tuesday, but some analystssaid its move was due to technical conditions.   Gold for August delivery gained $3.30 an ounce to settleat $364.10 in active trading. Don Tierney, a precious metalsanalyst at Stanley B. Bell andamp; Co. in New York, said thestrength was surprising for the day before a holiday. TheU.S. market was closed yesterday for Independence Day.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Tierney said a lot of Tuesday's buying probably wasdone by traders who didn't take profits Friday on shortpositions they had sold in anticipation of price declines.These traders, he said, probably didn't want the profits toshow up in their June or their second-quarter statements.   Mr. Tierney also said gold may have gained strengthbecause traders in many Middle Eastern countries wereobserving a four-day Muslim holiday that will not end untiltoday. &quot;Investors believe that the massive selling in March,May and June came from Middle Eastern interests,&quot; he said.&quot;They {were} taking some comfort from the holiday.&quot;   Mr. Tierney noted that Tuesday was the fifth consecutiveday that gold had closed higher, with the rally lifting theAugust contract by $11.20 an ounce since last Tuesday. Thenext technical resistance point, he said, is $365 an ounce.   Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a NewYork-based metals research consultant, said gold rose becauseit closed above $360 an ounce Monday.   &quot;It was simply follow-through buying,&quot; he said. &quot;That'sthe whole story.&quot;   Other analysts attributed gold's strength to recentweakness in the dollar, but Mr. Christian said that wasn'tmuch of a contributing factor.   The silver market held modest gains for most of Tuesday'ssession. But in the final two minutes of trading, heavyselling drove prices down. September silver settled two centsan ounce lower at $4.99 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Mr. Tierney said it was apparent that traders didn't want tohold any silver positions over the holiday. Earlier, therewas evidence of covering of short positions and fund buying,according to market technicians.   Mr. Tierney also said a smaller-than-expected number ofdelivery notices for silver against the expiring Julycontract indicate some support for silver. &quot;The fact that sofew notices are being delivered tells me that {tradersholding previously purchased contracts} want to acquiresilver bullion at these low prices,&quot; he said.   Platinum traders wondered why strong cash prices forrhodium, another metal in the platinum family, weren'tspilling over into their market. October platinum settled at$494.40 an ounce, down 10 cents. Rhodium was rumored to havetraded at $5,000 an ounce Friday and above $7,000 an ounceTuesday. There is no futures market for rhodium, which isused as a catalyst in emission-control units and in refining.   Mr. Christian of CPM Group said such high prices forrhodium are actually bearish for platinum. Traditionally, hesaid, rhodium is mined as a byproduct of platinum, but thatrelationship can become distorted under special conditionssuch as those now occurring. He said the rhodium-producingunit at the Rustenberg platinum mine in South Africa has beenexperiencing technical problems in recent months and thatthere have been problems lately at several other rhodiumrefineries too.   &quot;That means the market was expecting several thousandounces of rhodium that never appeared,&quot; Mr. Christian said.   Also affecting the relative prices of platinum and rhodiumis the ratio in which the two metals occur in the ore bodyfrom which they are mined. According to Mr. Christian, oneounce of rhodium is found for every 16 ounces of platinum inthe Merensky reef, the main platinum ore body in SouthAfrica. This ratio suggests that rhodium should sell forabout 16 times the price of platinum, he said, and the twometals currently are approaching that price ratio.   However, he said, there is an ore body called UG2 thatyields about one ounce of rhodium for every 4.6 ounces ofplatinum. Therefore, &quot;If platinum from the UG2 ore body is at$500 an ounce, any time rhodium sells for more than $2,300there is a strong incentive to mine rhodium and let platinumbe the byproduct,&quot; Mr. Christian said.   Most platinum still comes from Merensky, he said, butthere is a definite shift toward mining the UG2 ore bodybecause of the higher concentration of rhodium. &quot;Speculatorswho understand the mining economics of these two metals lookat the high price of rhodium and conclude that it is notbullish for platinum,&quot; Mr. Christian said.   Several participants in the European metals trade notedthat the rally in rhodium took place on extremely smallvolume. They said that if only a small amount of metal wereoffered to the market it could cause a sharp sell-off.   In other commodity markets Tuesday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for July and August pork bellyfutures contracts fell their daily limit of two cents a poundon heavier-than-expected deliveries of frozen pork bellies tocontract holders. Many of the deliveries were thought to havebeen made to speculators rather than commercial users,according to Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling ResearchCorp., Arlington Heights, Ill. That means the speculators arelikely to resell the bellies they have been stuck with,further depressing prices, Mr. Morgan said. Pork bellies areused in making bacon. July pork belly futures closed at 57.67cents a pound, and August bellies closed at 55.77 cents apound. Monday was the first day deliveries could have beenmade against holders of the July contract, but no deliverieswere made until Tuesday, analysts said. Support for porkbelly futures prices is likely to come from figures releasedafter the close of trading Tuesday, said Jerry Abbenhaus, afutures analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.He said the report of 3.6 million pounds of frozen belliesmoving out of warehouses last week was far above analysts'estimates of one million to 2.5 million pounds. Withwarehouse supplies dwindling more rapidly than expected,futures prices are likely to rebound somewhat, Mr. Abbenhaussaid.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices finished slightly higher,mostly in reaction to a strike by Norwegian offshore oilworkers. Wildcat strikes in defiance of a back-to-work orderfrom the Norwegian government and the workers' union havekept crude prices from declining in the face of enormousinventories and high output by Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries members. Roald Larsen, a Norwegian unionofficial, was quoted Tuesday as saying strikers were blockinghelicopter landing pads on some platforms to prevent reliefcrews from landing. Norway's normal North Sea oil productionis about 1.6 million barrels a day. North Sea Brent crude forAugust delivery rose 10 cents a barrel Tuesday to settle at$15.97, while the August West Texas Intermediate contractgained eight cents to close at $16.80 a barrel. A prolongedstrike would boost prices for North Sea oil and for othercrudes, especially the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediateand certain North African crudes, Lawrence Goldstein,president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said.News that Saudi Arabia told customers in the Far East thatcontract prices for August will be unchanged from July alsowas viewed as supportive for prices. However, a report by theAmerican Petroleum Institute released after trading endedTuesday unexpectedly showed an increase in U.S. crude oilinventories for last week. This report could overwhelmshort-term bullish sentiment, analysts said.</TEXT></DOC>
