ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis today celebrated a resoundingNew York victory that put him on a fast track toward the Democraticpresidential nomination and a fall showdown with Republican GeorgeBush. Jesse Jackson praised Dukakis for steering clear of attacksin the bitterly divisive primary, saying, ``Good for him and goodfor America.''   Sources said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was ending his presidentialbid after a poor third-place finish behind Dukakis and Jackson. Onesource, commenting on condition he not be named, said the onlyquestion was whether Gore would formally withdraw or merely suspendhis campaign in order to retain his delegates.   The Tennessee senator scheduled an announcement for Thursday inWashington.   Jackson today singled out New York Mayor Edward Koch for blamein a campaign in which Jackson said ``people were driven intohysteria'' by negative campaigning against him. But he said onCBS-TV that Dukakis ``resisted the temptation to take the campaignto the gutter.''   Dukakis, in interviews on NBC-TV and ABC-TV, said, ``I want tobe a unifier. ... I think we can put it back together. I'm somebodywho hates the politics of division.''   Dukakis won 51 percent of the New York vote, Jackson 37 percentand Gore 10 percent.   ``The Democratic Party's going to be unified and we're going tostop George Bush this November,'' Gore said, sounding a unity themethat must have been music to Dukakis' ears after two months ofrough-and-tumble campaigning.   Gore was expected to halt his campaign on Thursday. He hadstaked everything in New York with an expensive television campaignand a sometimes barb-tongued effort to pose himself as analternative to Dukakis and Jackson.   Dukakis ended up handily winning the ethnic white vote, bothJewish and Catholic. Jackson had more than 95 percent of the blackvote and enjoyed a narrow, 411,903 to 405,486 victory over Dukakisin the precincts of New York City. Networks said the black votemade up 22 to 27 percent of the 1.5 million statewide Democraticvote.   Victory brought Dukakis 164 of New York's 255 delegates. He nowhas 1,051 national delegates, just over half the 2,081 he needs toclinch nomination. Jackson had 89 to bring his total to 841.   Vice President George Bush continued his roll toward the GOPnomination and declared Dukakis ``a good bet'' to be his Democraticopponent in the fall. He said he looked forward to the competition,and Dukakis gave him a taste of the battle to come during aPhiladelphia appearance Tuesday evening.   ``This fall George Bush is going to be judged by a legacy of ...pink slips for our workers, golden parachutes for high rollers, andgreenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street,'' said theMassachusetts governor.   ``I want to make that American dream come alive again, not onlyin Trump Towers, not only in fancy apartments all over thiscountry, not only in a few privileged neighborhoods.''   Dukakis flew from Philadelphia to a New York victory rallywithin walking distance of Trump Tower, where he told cheeringsupporters, ``I love New York. Friends, if we can make it here wecan make it anywhere.''   Gore met with Jackson after midnight Tuesday. Jackson aidesdescribed the meeting as a ``courtesy call.'' Earlier, when Jacksonwas asked if he might get the senator's support, he replied, ``Idon't know what he is going to do. But I do respect him very much.''   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote looked thisway:   Dukakis had 783,568 or 51 percent.   Jackson had 573,112 or 37 percent.   Gore had 156,052 or 10 percent.   For the two Democratic survivors, the next battleground isPennsylvania next Tuesday, a state where Dukakis was assured ofwinning a major share of the 178 delegates at stake regardless ofthe outcome of a non-binding presidential preference vote.   ``We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,''lamented Jackson delegate coodinator Steve Cobble. Dukakis has astrong organization in the state, while Jackson lacks candidatesfor about one third of the delegate slots.   Unity was the theme being sounded by Democratic candidates andparty officials after the New York results rolled in.   ``It's a time fo really uniting this party,'' said Democraticchairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.   ``In Iowa we won the bronze,'' Dukakis said, reading from a textat his victory rally. ``In New Hampshire we won the gold. Tonightwe won the Oscar.'' At his side were his wife Kitty and hisOscar-winning cousin, actress Olympia Dukakis.   Dukakis said he expected to the remaining contests with Jacksonto remain free of animosity. ``We have a message of hope andoptimism. Neither of us believes in cutting up the other guy is away to win elections or the presidency,'' he said.   New York offered 96 Republican delegates. Bush won 91, one wasgoing uncommitted and Rep. Jack Kemp, a Buffalo-based campaigndropout, was winning four. Bush is closing in on the 1,139 neededto secure his nomination.   New Yorkers voted while Democratic senators met behind closeddoors in the Capitol to select 43 delegates to the party's nationalconvention. Dukakis won 13 pledges and outdueled Gore, who gainedsix as well as his own. Jackson was shut out, with the majority ofsenators remaining uncommitted.   In Vermont, Dukakis and Jackson fought to a virtual draw with 97percent of the vote counted from Democratic caucuses. Dukakis, whowon a non-binding primary vote March 1, would split with Jacksonthe 14 national convention delegates at stake if Tuesday's resultshold up at the state convention. Bush won going away.   There was widespread agreement that Dukakis would be unwise torelax his campaign pace. And party leaders suggested that Jackson'sfervent supporters in the black community must be persuaded thattheir candidate was in a fair fight to the finish.   During the often raucous New York campaign, New York City MayorEdward Koch had no such inhibitions. He accused Jackson of lyingunder pressure and said Jews and other supporters of Israel would``have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson.   Koch supported Gore.</TEXT></DOC>
