In accordance with thispolicy statement, the NRC will keep Governor-appointed State Liaison Officersroutinely informed on matters of interest to the States, and NRC will respondin a timely manner to State requests for information and State recommendationsconcerning matters within NRC's regulatory jurisdiction. If requested,the NRC will routinely inform State Liaison Officers of public meetingsbetween the NRC and its licensees and applicants, in order that State representativesmay attend as observers, and NRC will allow State observation of NRC inspectionactivities. The NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instrumentsof cooperation for State participation in NRC inspection activities whenthese programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. TheNRC will not consider State proposals for instruments of cooperation toconduct inspection programs of NRC-regulated activities without close cooperationwith, and oversight by, the NRC. This policy statement is intended to providea uniform basis for NRC/State cooperation as it relates to the regulatoryoversight of commercial nuclear power plants and other nuclear productionor utilization facilities. Instruments of cooperation between the NRC andthe States, approved prior to the effective date of this policy statementwill continue to be honored by the NRC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Carlton C.

Background </ITAG>The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the Act) was amended in 1959 to add section274, ``Cooperation With States.'' Section 274 of the Act provides the statutorybasis for NRC/State cooperation in nuclear matters and prescribes the frameworkfor State regulation of certain nuclear materials. The focus of section274 is primarily on protecting the public from radiological hazards ofsource, byproduct, and special nuclear materials below critical mass. Undersection 274, the Federal Government, primarily NRC, is assigned exclusiveauthority and responsibility to regulate the radiological and nationalsecurity aspects of the construction and operation of any nuclear productionor utilization facility, except for certain authority over air emissionslater granted to States by the Clean Air Act.The NRC has had extensive formal and informal interaction with the Statesthroughout its history. The Agreement State Program, under section 274bof the Act, is an example of a formal program where the NRC relinquishesits regulatory authority over certain radioactive materials to the States.There are currently 29 Agreement States regulating approximately 65 percentof those licensees nationwide that use or manufacture those types of radioactivematerial. The Agreement State Program operates under two Commission PolicyStatements, one for entering into section 274b agreements and one for periodicallyreviewing Agreement State radiation control programs for adequacy in protectingpublic health and safety and for compatibility with NRC programs. Thispolicy statement supports continuation of the Agreement State Program andis not meant to affect it.  This policy statement is not intended to affect rights to notice and toparticipate in hearings granted to States by statute or NRC regulations. Under 10 CFR Part 9, Subpart D, the NRC has provided procedures for handlingrequests for an NRC representative to participate or provide informationin judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings conducted by States or othercourts and agencies. This policy statement supports these procedures anddoes not affect them.  Under 10 CFR 50.55a, the NRC has recognized the role of the States withinthe American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Boiler and Pressure VesselCode (ASME Code) System. This policy statement does not affect the Stateand NRC relationship as laid out in the ASME Code.  The State Liaison Officer Program, established in 1976, provides a focalpoint in each of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico forcommunication between NRC and the States. The Governor-appointed StateLiaison Officer is intended to be the principal person in the State tokeep the Governor informed of nuclear regulatory matters of interest tothe Governor, to keep other State officials informed of these matters,and to respond to NRC inquiries.  Other areas in which NRC and States have worked together include environmentalmonitoring around the premises of nuclear power plant facilities and participationin the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc., which addressesradiological health in areas such as diagnostic and therapeutic X-rays,radioactive materials, and other related activities.  Under subsection 274i of the Act, the Commission is authorized, in carryingout its licensing and regulatory responsibilities to enter into a Memorandumof Understanding (MOU) with any State to perform inspections or other functionson a cooperative basis as the NRC deems appropriate. According to the legislativehistory of section 274, subsection 274i clarifies the Commission's existingauthority under subsection 161f which enables the NRC to obtain the servicesof State personnel to perform functions on its behalf as may be desirable. NRC has entered into MOUs with several States under subsection 274i ofthe Act. MOUs have helped to facilitate environmental review during constructionof nuclear power plants. At one point, there was a perceived need to broadenthe basis for formal cooperative instruments with States under subsection274i beyond that of water quality MOUs. As a result, general or ``umbrella''MOUs were negotiated, with subagreements on specific issues such as low-levelwaste package and transport inspections. Two unique agreements were negotiatedwith Oregon; one concerning the sharing of proprietary information regardingthe Trojan facility and the other covering coordination of the State andNRC resident inspector programs at Trojan. Additionally, the NRC has documentedthe protocol that States must follow to be permitted to observe certainNRC activities in ``letter agreements.''  In recent years, States have taken the initiative to monitor more closelycommercial nuclear power plants and other nuclear production or utilizationfacilities within, and adjacent to, their State boundaries by becomingbetter informed and, in some cases, more involved in activities relatedto the regulation and operation of those facilities. It was this increasedinterest by States to become more actively involved in NRC activities thatcaused the NRC to re-examine those agreements previously negotiated withStates and to determine a uniform policy for how further State proposalsshould be handled. In developing this policy statement to be used to respondto future State proposals, the Commission, recognizing that the regulatoryresponsibilities assigned exclusively to the NRC by the Act cannot be delegated,has considered: (1) Those activities it deems appropriate for States toconduct on a cooperative basis and are desirable for State personnel toperform on behalf of the NRC; and (2) its oversight responsibility to ensurethat NRC standards, regulations, and procedures are met where State representativescarry out NRC functions. Further, it is the Commission's intention to provideuniformity in its handling of State requests. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Comments and NRC Response  </ITAG>On June 13, 1988, the Commission's Policy Statement on Cooperation withStates at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants and Other Nuclear Productionor Utilization Facilities was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public comment (53 FR 21981.) The commentperiod expired July 13, 1988. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, the Commission stated that the ``proposedpolicy will be followed in the interim, except for those paragraphs inthe policy statement and Implementation section dealing with State proposalsfor instruments of cooperation for participation in inspections and inspectionentrance and exit meetings. The Commission will not act on these specifictypes of State-proposed instruments of cooperation until the comment periodexpires and the policy statement is published as a final policy statement.'' The NRC received 28 letters of comment; fourteen from members and representativesof the nuclear power industry, including electric utilities and their counsel,thirteen from various State offices and one from a public interest group.State Comments  Most of the State offices expressed support for the NRC's policy ``to cooperatefully with State governments as they seek to respond to the expectationsof their citizens that their health and safety be protected and that therebe minimal impact on the environment as a result of activities licensedby the NRC.'' In the opinion of these States, the NRC policy statementwould, among other things, enable the NRC to maintain uniformity in itsrelations with all the States, strengthen Federal-State cooperation, reduceduplication of effort, encourage the development of a unified NRC/Stateposition on matters of joint concern, avoid the perception of dual regulationand improve nuclear safety. By giving ``host'' States, i.e., States inwhich an NRC licensed facility is located, a greater opportunity to participatewith NRC in matters involving the use of radioactive materials, includingthe use of those materials in nuclear power reactors located within theState, States would become better informed about the day-to-day activitiesof NRC licensees. With the opening of these avenues of communication, NRClicensees would be made more aware of State concerns in related areas.Two States stated that they are prepared to enter into a joint inspectionprogram with NRC at this time. One State expressed no immediate interestbut indicated that it might wish to participate in such a program in thefuture. This State was supportive of the six conditions specified in thePolicy Statement as prerequisites to State participation in NRC inspectionsand inspection entrance and exit meetings in accordance with the provisionsof an instrument of cooperation entered into with NRC. One State indicatedthat it would appreciate routine notification of NRC inspection activitiesand public meetings affecting the State. One State supported, while anotherState opposed, independent State inspections of federally regulated facilities.The stated reasons for opposing such inspections were that they would confusethe regulated sector and would require the expenditure of scarce Stateresources in an area in which there is already adequate Federal enforcement.Noting the possible difficulty of securing needed funds for such inspections,one State recommended that the policy statement include suggested meansof funding State inspections.Noting that State needs for interaction with NRC are especially importantin areas which are substantially affected by NRC actions but for whichthe State has central responsibility (e.g., rate-making,\1\<NOTE/> emergency preparedness, environmental protection) severalStates expressed concern regarding the extent to which their differingneeds and responsibilities would be accommodated under the NRC policy.Some States expressed the view that because of differing nature of Stateresponsibilities, States might find it difficult to qualify for a Federal/Stateinstrument of cooperation. One State suggested that the policy statementaffirmatively recognize ``the value of cooperation between the NRC andthe States in areas where there is mutual interest but differing goalsand responsibilities.'' Another State suggested that State representativesshould be permitted to participate as observers in NRC enforcement, policy,exit or other meetings whenever the matters addressed involve issues ofconcern to the State.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For example, for nine years the New York Public ServiceCommission has had staff located at the Nine Mile Point site and untilrecently at Shoreham for the purpose of construction monitoring in orderto evaluate the reasonableness of construction costs that directly affectbase rates as well as operation and maintenance expenses.Several States objected to that portion of the policy statement which wouldchannel all communication between NRC and a State through the State LiaisonOfficer on the grounds that this procedure is too restrictive. Noting theneeds of various State agencies to maintain a continuing relationship andongoing dialogue with NRC, these States recommended that the policy statementbe modified to allow for more than one State contact.The comments submitted by the Oregon Department of Energy reflect Oregon'sexperience in implementing the provisions of a 1979 State law requiringthe presence of a State inspector at the site of the Trojan Nuclear Facilityin accordance with the provisions of an agreement relating to residentinspectors entered into between NRC and the Oregon Department of Energy(ODOE) in January 1980. Pursuant to these arrangements, ODOE participatesin many of NRC's regulatory activities at Trojan. Based on its experienceover the past eight years, ODOE is of the opinion that ``personal interactionwith plant staff is essential in gaining the information needed to accuratelyassess and influence plant safety.'' According to ODOE, this experiencedemonstrates that State and NRC regulatory programs can be complementarywithout being duplicative and that State-Federal interaction on plant safetyissues has been very productive. In its comments, ODOE also states:<ITAG tagnum="21">There have been no instances where Oregon has misinterpreted NRC safetyrequirements. Oregon regulators have never redirected the licensee's attentionto areas not consistent with NRC safety priorities. And our agreement withthe NRC prevents such problems from occurring. It states:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``If ODOE finds it necessary to direct the operators of Trojan totake action, ODOE shall obtain NRC's prior agreement that such action doesnot have an adverse effect on plant or public safety.''</ITAG>Expressing appreciation of NRC's cooperative approach to Oregon's regulatoryprogram and noting that Oregon has worked hard to build and maintain publicconfidence that State and Federal regulatory programs assure safe operationsat Trojan, ODOE expressed its belief that this relationship has benefitedNRC and that dilution of the State's regulatory role to the level in thedraft policy statement would not be in the best interest of the public.Citing concerns relating to the operation of the Peach Bottom nuclear powerreactor, located in Pennsylvania only three miles north of the Maryland-Pennsylvaniaborder, Maryland expressed the view that the benefits accorded States underthe policy statement should not be limited to ``host'' States, but shouldalso be extended to all States within ten miles of a nuclear power plant.One State expressed general concern with the provision in the policy statementwhich would require States, as a condition of entering into an instrumentof cooperation with NRC for the purpose of State participation in inspectionsand inspection entrance and exit meetings, to recognize ``the Federal Government,primarily NRC, as having the exclusive authority and responsibility toregulate the radiological and national security aspects of the constructionand operation of nuclear production or utilization facilities, except forcertain authority over air emissions granted to States by the Clean AirAct.'' (53 FR 21982, June 13, 1988.) This State declared that it ``willnot concede that the federal government has unqualified and unspecifiedauthority over these matters where public health, safety and environmentalconcerns are at risk.'' Noting that in 1985 it had entered into an agreement\2\<NOTE/> with NRC Region V which established a mutually acceptableprocedure for the exchange of information concerning maintenance, engineering,quality assurance, security, emergency planning and operation of nuclearpower plants located in the State, this State stated that it ``will reviewthe final policy statement adopted by the Commission to propose changesin the existing agreement which may be mutually productive.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In accordance with this agreement, State personnel haveattended NRC inspector's exit meetings, shared information on environmentalmonitoring, participated in significant meetings between plant managementpersonnel and senior representatives of NRC and worked jointly with NRCon emergency response drills and exercises.Several States questioned the need to require State programs carried outunder an instrument of cooperation to specify ``minimum education, experience,training, and qualification requirements for State representatives whichare patterned after those of NRC inspectors.'' In the opinion of some States,the standard of knowledge and training appropriate for State observersneed not be as stringent as that for State inspectors. Other States expressedthe view that the training and educational requirements applicable to Federaland State personnel need not be identical but should instead bear somereasonable relationship to the differing jurisdictional responsibilitiesof the Federal government and the States. One State questioned the provisionsof the policy statement characterizing <T3>qualified</T3> State representatives as those ``knowledgeable in radiologicalhealth and safety matters.'' This State pointed out that ``[i]f the intentof this definition is to exclude persons from disciplines other than radiologicalhealth and safety, it will unreasonably limit state involvement * * * .''and that ``[t]his narrow a definition would contradict the spirit, if notthe intent, of the objective of furthering federal/state cooperation.''In addition, the State commenters recommended that the policy statementbe revised in the following respects:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should recognize the unique and diversecommunication needs of various State agencies and allow for more than oneState contact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should affirmatively recognize the valueof cooperation between NRC and the States in areas where there is mutualinterest but differing goals and responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should be broadened to recognize theStates' needs for interaction with the NRC in areas central to State responsibilities,but substantially affected by NRC actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The second paragraph of the Implementation section shouldbe revised by inserting the following sentence between the fifth and sixthsentences in that paragraph: ``After a positive assessment, State inspectors'inspections may be conducted individually and would be coordinated withthe NRC resident inspector.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should be revised to accord all Stateslocated within ten miles \3\<NOTE/> of a commercial nuclear power reactor the same rights andresponsibilities accorded to the State in which the reactor is sited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ An industry commenter noted that in the case of a particularfacility, the Commission might find it necessary to deal with the concernsof all States located within 50 miles of the ingestion pathway.<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should include suggested means by whicha State could obtain funding for its inspection program.</ITAG>Public Interest Group CommentsThe comments from the public interest group expressed support for the policystatement because if offers some important opportunities for State involvementin the protection of the health and safety of citizens and commended theNRC for taking the initiative in pursuing cooperation with States.Industry CommentsFourteen comments were received from representatives of the nuclear powerindustry, including one from a major industry organization, two from legalcounsel on behalf of fifteen electric utilities holding NRC operating licensesfor nuclear power plants, and eleven from individual electric utilitiesholding NRC operating licenses; three of the latter were also includedin the group of electric utilities represented by legal counsel.For the most part, the industry commenters acknowledged the legitimateconcerns of the States in being kept well-informed of NRC's activitieswith respect to the regulation of commercial nuclear power plants. Theindustry commenters also expressed general support for the Commission'soverall goal of promoting and enhancing NRC/State cooperation. One commenterexpressed the view that ``policies which aid qualified State representativesin improving their understanding of the design and operation of * * * [commercialnuclear power plants] are beneficial to all parties and should be encouraged.''One commenter characterized the policy statement as ``a timely reaffirmationof federal preemption in the area of nuclear safety, which properly focuseson state observation and participation in NRC meetings and inspections.''One commenter expressed affirmation support fot the Commission's statedposition that in those instances in which inspections were conducted byState representatives, ``[a]ll enforcement action will be undertaken bythe NRC.''<ITAG tagnum="20">(53 FR 21983, June 13, 1988)</ITAG>The industry commenters were in substantial disagreement, however, as tohow this goal might best be achieved. Two commenters expressed unqualifiedsupport for the policy statement as published June 13, 1988, one statingthat the policy statement correctly maintains the current balance betweenFederal and State authority in the field of nuclear regulation, the otherurging that the Commission promulgate the policy statement in final formas soon as practicable. Two commenters considered the policy statement'ssix criteria for an acceptable State proposal for entrance into an NRC/Stateinstrument of cooperation relating to nuclear power plant inspections tobe reasonable and appropriate. However, one of these commenters was concernedthat the policy statement does not address how the NRC will enforce itsauthority should a State representative exceed the scope of his/her authorityunder an instrument of cooperation. In order to assure continuing compliance,the commenter recommended that either the policy statement or the instrumentof cooperation provide for some sort of periodic review.  Several commenters expressed contrary views. One commenter did not believea policy of allowing State participation in routine inspection activitiesto be necessary or in the best interest of the NRC or its licensees. Anothercommenter expressed the view that legitimate concerns of States regardingthe safety and operation of nuclear power plants could be addressed inthe currently prescribed licensing process. However, this commenter wasalso of the opinion that the NRC should proceed on a case-by-case basis\4\<NOTE/> if it feels State input is essential. The commenter alsonoted that the policy statement as published for comment is ambiguous andthat ``[t]his ambiguity can lead to a situation where a State, for whateverreason, could hinder the NRC in its regulation of nuclear power.''   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ If the NRC should decide to proceed in this manner, thecommenter recommended that the following guidelines should be followed: <ITAG tagnum="28">The NRC should:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; consider a State's concerns regarding safety of a nuclearpower plant responding, when necessary, with an inspection which wouldinclude State observers;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; provide a State with timely information regarding its concerns,providing the information is not proprietary or does not pertain to securitymatters;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; include State representation in public meetings with thelicensees;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; obtain State assistance when such assistance would be a benefitto the NRC in its regulatory duties; and   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; have complete oversight of State activities regarding nuclearsafety.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The NRC should not:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; permit independent State inspection programs or reviews; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">andbullet; delegate responsibility for performing NRC inspections toState representatives.</ITAG>Most commenters endorsed the second paragraph of the policy statement whichprovides that the NRC will (1) continue to keep Governor-appointed StateLiaison Officers routinely informed on matters of interest to States, (2)respond in a timely manner to a State's requests for information and toits recommendations concerning matters within the NRC's regulatory jurisdiction,(3) upon request, routinely inform State Liaison Officers of public meetingsbetween NRC and its licensees and applicants in order that State representativesmay attend as observers, and (4) upon request, permit State representativesto observe but not to participate actively in specific inspections and/orinspection entrance and exit meetings where State representatives are knowledgeablein radiological health and safety matters. In the opinion of the commenters,these provisions constitute both an appropriate and an adequate basis forachieving the desired communication and cooperation between the Commissionand the States. Two commenters expressed a willingness to have State representativespresent at public meetings with NRC licensees. These same two commentersfavored giving States timely information provided the information in questiondid not relate to proprietary or security matters.  Viewing the observation process as a logical first step to ultimate participationin NRC inspection activities, one commenter expressed concern that Staterepresentatives should be allowed to observe NRC inspections and/or NRCinspection entrance and exit meetings solely on the approval of an NRCRegional Administrator. In the opinion of the commenter, observation byState representatives should be delayed until the State and NRC have signeda formal instrument of cooperation.  Most industry commenters, including the respective legal counsel retainedby electric utilities holding NRC operating licenses, opposed, in wholeor in part, those portions of the policy statement which seek to achievethe goal of NRC/State cooperation by delegating to the States any partof the Commission's authority to conduct inspections at nuclear power plants.In particular, the commenters objected to the provisions of the policystatement which relate to State proposals to enter into instruments ofcooperation for State participation in NRC inspections of commercial nuclearpower plants and in NRC inspection entrance and exit meetings, and thetypes of inspection activities which qualified State representatives maybe permitted to perform. Some of the commenters opposed any type of Stateinspection program, whether conducted independently or under continuingNRC oversight. Other commenters were principally concerned about thosepassages of the policy statement which, in their opinion, carry ``the clearimplication * * * that there will be occasions on which State representativeswill be allowed to conduct their own inspections at nuclear generatingplants `on behalf of' the NRC, unaccompanied by NRC representatives.''\5\<NOTE/> Two commenters who opposed independent State inspection programsindicated a willingness to accept State participation in NRC inspectionsas long as the State representatives were always accompanied by a qualifiedNRC inspector. One of these commenters suggested that the role of Staterepresentatives at an NRC inspection should be the same as that accordedNRC consultants.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ According to one commenter, ``* * * the policy statementcompletely fails to establish the legal authority of State representativesto alone inspect nuclear safety activities_in the words of the policy statement,`on behalf of the NRC.' ''  The commenters who opposed any type of State inspection program, whetherconducted independently or under continuing NRC oversight, strongly urgedthe Commission to provide specifically that no State radiological healthand safety inspections of NRC-licensed commercial nuclear power reactorswill be permitted, independent or otherwise. In their view, the role ofState representatives should be strictly limited to observation of, orparticipation in, entrance and exit meetings. Noting that implementationof this aspect of the policy statement would make the regulatory processunnecessarily complicated and redundant_under the policy NRC staff wouldbe required both to qualify State inspectors and to assume full responsibilityfor the manner in which State inspectors conduct any subsequent activities_thecommenters based their objections on legal, policy and practical grounds.According to these commenters, the Atomic energy Act of 1954, as amended,gives the NRC exclusive responsibility for regulating the radiologicaland national security aspects of the construction and operation of nuclearproduction and utilization facilities. Therefore, under the doctrine ofFederal preemption, States are without legal authority to conduct inspectionsof nuclear power plants for the purpose of protecting the radiologicalhealth and safety of the public. By the same token, NRC is also precludedfrom delegating to other persons, including States, any of its regulatoryresponsibilities respecting such facilities, including, among others, theresponsibility of inspecting commercial nuclear power reactors. The commentersare also of the view that delegation of inspection authority to State representativesas proposed in the policy statement exceeds the scope and intent of section274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. In the opinion of thesecommenters, section 274i of the Act does not provide an independent legalbasis for entering into agreements with States, but must be read in thecontext of section 274 of which it is a part. Under the provisions of section274b, States are only authorized to enter into agreements to regulate materials,specifically, source, byproduct, special nuclear material and low-levelradioactive waste. Section 274c of the Act, which reserves certain authoritiesto the Commission, makes clear that the responsibility for regulating nuclearpower reactors from the standpoint of radiological health and safety remainswith the NRC. In view of these statutory provisions, it is the consideredopinion of the commenters that, under existing law, section 274i ``shouldproperly be read to permit only inspections related to * * * materials''and to allow ``NRC to enter `instruments of cooperation' only with respectto licensed activities other than commercial nuclear power reactors (e.g.,materials licensees) or with respect to matters other than radiologicalhealth and safety (e.g., certain environmental matters.)'' Section 274ishould not be read as authorizing NRC to enter into agreements with Statesunder which States will conduct inspections of commercial nuclear powerplants for NRC.The commenters also viewed the provisions of the policy statement invitingStates to enter into instruments of cooperation with NRC for the purposeof participating in NRC inspections and inspection entrance and exit meetingsas contrary to law because such arrangements constitute dual or concurrentregulation. As the legislative history of section 274 of the Atomic EnergyAct of 1954, as amended, makes clear, it was the intent of section 274that regulatory authority either be exercised by the Federal governmentor by the States, but not by both.The commenters also objected to the provisions of the NRC policy statementrespecting the use of State inspectors at nuclear power plants in accordancewith NRC/State instruments of cooperation on the ground that despite thesearrangements such activities could have negative implications for publichealth and safety. According to the commenters, permitting States to participatein NRC inspections would greatly increase the likelihood of divergent Federaland State interpretations of regulatory requirements which would, in turn,create uncertainty and confusion, inject an unsettling and destabilizingelement into the regulatory process and result in significant delay inthe resolution of specific problems identified during an inspection. Inconnection with this objection, the commenters noted the parallel concernsexpressed by NRC ``that independent State inspection programs could directan applicant's or licensee's attention to areas not consistent with NRCsafety priorities, misinterpret NRC safety requirements, or give the perceptionof dual regulation.'' (53 FR 21981, June 13, 1988.) As an example of thepractical difficulties that might be encountered, the commenters pointedto the Commission's own recent experience with its emergency planning regulationswhich accorded State and local governments a substantial role. Accordingto the commenters, `history has shown that those regulations have resultedin State-imposed delays on reactor operations, and in one case, a finishedpower plant apparently will be torn down before it ever operates.'' Thecommenters also expressed the view that these difficulties could engenderfrictions which if left unresolved could defeat the avowed purpose of theCommission's policy to enhance cooperation with the States.Claiming that the policy statement does not appear to address any clearneed and that its implementation is unlikely to result in any significantbenefits other than greater coordination of Federal/State activities, thecommenters pointed out that arrangements for State participation in NRCinspections under instruments of cooperation would be expensive and wouldlikely result in efficient utilization of rate payer resources. For example,NRC personnel would be required to devote time and resources to training,qualifying, managing and communicating with State personnel and to overseeingthe State's program. In addition to paying for time billed by NRC, NRClicensees would likely be called upon to provide on-site facilities andservices for State personnel participating in nuclear power plant inspectionscomparable to those provided to NRC resident inspectors. States would berequired to bear the direct costs, e.g., hiring expenses, salaries, employmentbenefits, of hiring and maintaining a cadre of individuals qualified toconduct inspections of commercial nuclear power plants. In the opinionof one commenter, it would be less wasteful and more cost effective tohave a few NRC inspectors with appropriate training and expertise thanto have many States acquire these capabilities. In this connection, thecommenter questioned whether NRC would be able, in view of continuing budgetconstraints, to give State inspectors proper training and maintain an appropriatelevel of oversight of State inspectors and State inspection programs.Several commenters criticized the policy statement because it failed toaddress such practical problems as how the NRC will judge the adequacyof a State inspection program and how the NRC will assure the competenceof State inspectors and whether these determinations will be made by theRegions or at NRC Headquarters. In the opinion of the commenter, uniforminterpretation of the policy statement could best be assured by includinga detailed description of an adequate State program and specifying minimumqualifications for State inspectors.One commenter recommended that the policy statement provide for arbitrationas a method of resolving problems in those instances in which a State representativeor State inspector is less than fully qualified. Another commenter requestedthat NRC licensees be informed whenever a State initiatives negotiationswith NRC regarding an instrument of cooperation so that the licensees couldparticipate in the process.One commenter noted that in the case of a particular facility, it mightbe necessary for the Commission to deal with the concerns of several States,for example, States located within 50 miles of the ingestion pathway, insteadof limiting Commission consideration to the concerns of the State withinwhich the facility site is located. Another commenter had no objectionto keeping appropriate representatives of neighboring States apprised ofregulatory activities at a specific facility but urged that the on-sitepresence of State personnel be limited to representatives of the Statein which the facility is located.Three commenters expressed the view that the NRC should closely monitorand periodically evaluate the implementation of whatever policy is finallyadopted and any instruments of cooperation executed thereunder to assurethat the program is effective, that there is no misapplication of authority,and that the best interests of the Nation are being served.In addition, the industry commenters recommended that the policy statementbe revised in the following respects:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should provide specifically that noState radiological health and safety inspections of NRC-licensed commercialnuclear power reactors will be permitted, independent or otherwise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The policy statement should strictly limit the role of Staterepresentatives to observation of, or participation in, NRC entrance andexit meetings.

The commenters also expressed concerns regarding therole, if any, to be accorded applicants for or holders of NRC licensesfor commercial nuclear power reactors and other nuclear production andutilization facilities during ongoing negotiations between NRC and a Stateregarding the terms of a NRC/State instrument of cooperation.<ITAG tagnum="81">Legal Issues</ITAG>We turn first to the commenters' legal concerns that the portions of thepolicy statement which provide for State participation in NRC inspectionsat commercial nuclear power plants and in NRC inspection entrance and exitmeetings in accordance with the provisions of an NRC/State instrument ofcooperation are contrary to law because such activities are precluded bythe doctrine of Federal preemption and beyond the scope of section 274of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.Section 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, sets forth thegeneral powers of the Commission in licensing or regulating any of theactivities authorized by the Act, including the licensing and regulationof utilization and production facilities. Section 161f (42 U.S.C. 2201(f))which is identical to section 12(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 andhas remained unchanged since February 17, 1954 when it was reenacted intopublic law (Pub. L. 703, 68 Stat. 949) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Sec. 161. General Provisions._In the performance of its functionsthe Commission is authorized to_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. with the consent of the agency concerned, utilize or employ theservices or personnel of any Government agency or any State or local government,or voluntary or uncompensated personnel, to perform such functions on itsbehalf as may appear desirable;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>This provision, standing alone, gives the Commission broad discretionaryauthority to enter into arrangments with States respecting inspectionsat nuclear power plants, including arrangements pursuant to instrumentsof cooperation as described in the policy statement.In 1959, at the time of the enactment of the Federal/State Amendment whichadded section 274 to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Congress clarifiedthis authority in section 161f by providing in the first sentence of section274i that<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission <T3>in carrying out its licensing and regulatory responsibilities underthis Act</T3> is authorized to enter into agreements with any State, orgroup of States, to perform inspections or other functions on a cooperativebasis as the Commission deems appropriate. (Emphasis supplied.)</ITAG>The legislative history of section 274\7\<NOTE/> contains no evidence that the first sentence in section 274iwas intended to limit the broad scope of the Commission's authority insection 161f to those matters over which the States were authorized toassume regulatory authority in accordance with the provisions of section274b agreements. The legislative history merely indicates that one permissibleway in which the Commission may exercise its authority under section 161fis ``* * * to enter into agreements with any State, or group of States,to perform inspections or other functions on a cooperative basis as theCommission deems appropriate.'' For the foregoing reasons, the Commissiondisagrees with the conclusion of the commenters that section 274i doesnot provide an independent legal basis for entering into agreements withStates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For an account of the legislative history of section 274,<T3>see</T3> NUREG 0388, Final Task Force Report on the Agremeent StatesProgram, December 1977, Appendix A, especially pp. A-3_A-6.The commenters' objections that the provisions of the policy statementrelating to State participation in NRC inspections at commercial nuclearpower plants pursuant to an NRC/State instrument of cooperation are contraryto law by reason of the doctrine of Federal preemption are equally withoutmerit.Federal preemption, which is based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution,resolves controversies which arise as a result of the conflicting demandsof Federal and State laws. Here there is no conflicting State law. Theonly document of concern is a policy statement prepared by a Federal agencywhich states in the clearest possible terms that it will be implementedat both the State and Federal level in strict accordance with applicablelaw.\8\<NOTE/> Since, as the above analysis shows, the policy statementis within NRC's statutory authority, there is no preemption issue.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For example, the policy statement affirmatively ``[r]ecognizesthe Federal Government, primarily NRC, as having the exclusive authorityand responsibility to regulate the radiological and national security aspectsof the construction and operation of nuclear production or utilizationfacilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted toStates by the Clean Air Act; * * *'' the policy statement also identifiessix elements which must be included in a state proposal for an instrumentof cooperation in order to assure the proposal's consistency with the provisionsof section 274c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Section 274cprovides in part that ``[n]o agreement entered into pursuant to subsectionb. shall provide for discontinuance of any authority and the Commissionshall retain authority and responsibility with respect to regulation of_(1)the construction and operation of any production or utilization facility;* * *''A related concern expressed by a State commenter was that any formal acknowledgementby a state of NRC's legal authority, as recited in the first of the sixconditions enumerated in the policy statement, might be viewed as a relinquishmentby a State of some part of the State's rightful authority to protect thehealth, welfare and environment of its citizens. It is not the purposeof the policy statement to alter the respective responsibilities of theFederal government and the States or to require the States to concede tothe Federal government any areas of the legitimate State responsibility.The only purpose of the policy statement is to describe the ground rulesunder which representatives of States can participate in NRC inspectionsand related meetings, a Federal function. Accordingly, it is both reasonableand appropriate that the Commission should identify in the text of thepolicy statement the legal authority on which its policies and regulatoryactivities are based, and to ask the States to recognize that the inspectionswhich they will be participating in are Federal, not State, inspections.As further evidence of the fact that it is not the purpose of the policystatement to encroach on the lawful exercise of State prerogatives, theCommission will continue its prior practice of including a general provisionin agreements entered into with States under section 274i of the AtomicEnergy Act of 1954, as amended, which states that nothing in the agreementis intended to restrict or expand the statutory authority of either NRCor the State.<ITAG tagnum="81">Implementation of Policy Statement_Effect on NRC Licensees; Costs</ITAG>According to industry commenters, implementation of the provisions of thepolicy statement respecting the use of State inspectors at nuclear powerplants in accordance with NRC/State instruments of cooperation is likelyto have a negative effect on public health and safety. In the opinion ofthese commenters, permitting States to participate in NRC inspections wouldnot only create the appearance of dual regulation but would also greatlyincrease the likelihood of divergent Federal and State interpretationsof regulatory requirements. The resulting uncertainty and confusion wouldinject an unsettling and destabilizing element into the regulatory processand could significantly delay efforts to resolve specific problems identifiedduring an inspection.State commenters expressed contrary views. In the opinion of these commenters,implementation of the NRC policy statement would foster uniformity, strengthenFederal-State cooperation, reduce duplication of effort, encourage thedevelopment of a unified NRC/State position on matters of joint concern,avoid the perception of dual regulation and improve nuclear safety.Based on its experience with State resident inspectors at the Trojan NuclearPower Plant in Oregon, which has demonstrated that complementary State-Federalinteraction on plant safety issues can be productive, the Commission believesthat the concerns expressed by the industry commenters may be unwarranted.The Commission reiterates its commitment, as stated in the Implementationsection of the policy statement, to perform a formal review of a memorandumof understanding (MOU) between NRC and a State relating to State involvementin NRC inspections<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * not less than six months after the effective date [of the MOU]* * * to evaluate implementation of the MOU and resolve any problems identified.Final agreements will be subject to periodic reviews and may be amendedor modified upon written agreement by both parties and may be terminatedupon 30 days written notice by either party.</ITAG>In view of this commitment, as well as the Commission's announced intentthat activities undertaken to implement the policy statement shall be carriedout in close cooperation with and be subject to oversight by the NRC, theCommission has concluded that these provisions in the policy statementaddress the concerns raised by the industry commenters and that at thistime no change in the policy statement is warranted.State and industry commenters also expressed concerns regarding the costsof implementing the policy statement. Noting that States might experiencedifficulty in obtaining needed funds, one State recommended that the policystatement include suggested means of funding State inspections. Industrycommenters were concerned that implementation of the policy statement wouldresult in the assessment of higher regulatory fees.The Commission does not intend to charge licensees additional fees forregulatory activities because those activities are conducted in accordancewith the provisions of the policy statement. Nor does the Commission expector intend any increase in regulatory costs as a result of adopting andpromulgating the policy statement. In view of these circumstances, theconcerns expressed by the industry commenters do not appear to be wellfounded.Although requested to do so, the Commission has declined to revise thepolicy statement in order to address the topic of possible sources of Statefunds. This position is consistent with the underlying policy of the 1959Federal-State amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, whichmakes no provision for the expenditure of Federal funds for the purposeof administering State regulatory programs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Communication through State Liaison Officers</ITAG>Several States objected to that portion of the policy statement which wouldchannel all communication between NRC and a State through the State LiaisonOfficer on the grounds that this procedure is too restrictive. Noting theneeds of various State agencies to maintain a continuing relationship andongoing dialogue with NRC, these States recommended that the policy statementbe modified to allow for more than one State contact.The Commission is well aware of the varying interests of States in theactivities of commercial nuclear power plants and of the number of differentState agencies with direct responsibility for various aspects of thoseactivities. It is precisely because this situation exists that the Commissionhas adopted a policy which requires that all inquiries and requests fromStates respecting observations and inspections at commercial nuclear powerplants and all information from NRC to States respecting these mattersbe channeled through a single point, namely the office of the State LiaisonOfficer. This arrangement not only assures the Commission that NRC informationof interest to the States will be sent forward to those State agenciesthat need to know, it also assures interested State agencies that theirrequests and inquiries will be handled in a uniform and businesslike manner.Since the primary purpose of the policy statement is to articulate themanner in which the Commission plans to conduct its business in this areaand to provide guidance to NRC Regional Offices which will assure thatthese matters are handled uniformly, it is neither necessary nor appropriateto modify the policy statement to elaborate further on the differing natureor wide variety of State responsibilities.For the foregoing reasons, the Commission has made no change in the provisionsof the policy statement which relate to communication through State LiaisonOffices. The Commission has also concluded that the policy statement adequatelyreflects the complementary interests and responsibilities of the Statesand that no changes relating to this matter are needed.<ITAG tagnum="81">State Attendance at and Participation in NRC Inspections</ITAG>Citing the likelihood of increased complexity, confusion and uncertaintyin the regulatory process and the possibility of an attendant reductionin the safety of nuclear power plants, most of the industry commentersopposed allowing State representatives to participate in NRC inspectionsand stated that in no event should State representatives be allowed toperform independent inspections or reviews.As noted earlier, the Commission believes that the concerns of the industrycommenters regarding a possible decrease in nuclear safety may be unwarranted.At the same time, the Commission wishes to make quite clear that the policystatement does not contemplate and should not be interpreted as authorizingStates, using State radiological health and safety standards, to conductindependent health and safety inspections of commercial nuclear power plants.As explained in the policy statement, the NRC inspections and associatedentrance and exit meetings which State representatives will be permittedto attend as observers or as participants, for the purpose of assistingNRC, will be conducted under the close and continuing surveillance of theNRC and in strict accordance with Federal standards and regulations. Thepresence of the NRC is essential not only because all communications withthe licensee must be made through the NRC but also because the NRC is solelyresponsible for taking any needed enforcement action. If information relevantto an NRC enforcement matter is obtained by a State representative duringan inspection and subsequently made available to the NRC, it is expectedthat the State representative would be invited to attend the enforcementconference. Moreover, State assistance, including testimony at any enforcementhearing, may be needed to carry out NRC's enforcement program.A related matter concerns the role to be accorded State representativeswho wish to attend or participate in entrance and exit meetings and inspectionsof nuclear power reactors located in adjacent States. Despite disagreementson the criteria to be used to identify adjacent States, there was a generalconsensus among commenters who addressed this issue that representativesfrom adjacent States should be permitted to attend meetings and inspectionssubject to the same conditions that apply to representatives from the hostState.The Commission believes that interstate cooperation should be encouragedand will endeavor to do so. After the Commission has gained some practicalexperience in implementing the present policy which is limited to cooperationbetween NRC and ``host'' States, i.e., States in which an NRC licensedfacility is located, the Commission may reconsider the question of whetherand to what extent the policy statement should be broadened to encompasscooperative arrangements between NRC and ``adjacent'' States.The policy statement makes clear that State representatives must be properlyqualified to undertake their assigned roles, whether as participants orobservers. Although State representatives who only observe need not beas knowledgeable technically as State representatives who actively participatein inspections, they must have some general understanding of the natureof nuclear power for the observation to be meaningful. Consistent withthose provisions of the policy statement which contemplate that State representativeswill be qualified to perform any tasks they may be assigned, it is theexpectation of the Commission that, subject to specific guidelines containedin the formal instrument of cooperation entered into between NRC and aparticular State, the extent to which State representatives may be permittedto participate in an NRC inspection will be determined in each instanceby the NRC representative authorized to conduct the inspection in lightof the particular qualifications of the State representative accompanyingthe NRC inspection team. While the Commission recognizes the importanceof specifying minimum qualifications for State inspectors, as suggestedby one of the commenters, it is of the opinion that this matter can bestbe dealt with in the context of each NRC/State instrument of cooperationwhen the qualifications of individuals who may be able to perform thisfunction for the State are likely to be better known. In its present form,the policy statement provides adequate general guidance on this matter.For these same reasons, the Commission has also declined to adopt the suggestionof a State commenter to add an additional sentence concerning State inspectorsto the second paragraph of the Implementation section. Accordingly, theCommission has made no changes in the policy statement in response to thesecomments.Several commenters expressed the view that the policy statement shouldprohibit State disclosure of inspection findings after as well as beforethe NRC inspection report is publicly released. Commenters also expressedconcern about the disclosure by State representatives of any underlyingdata obtained or any notes or observations made while attending or participatingin an NRC inspection. The Commission is of the opinion that insofar asState representatives are apprised of this information as a result of theirinvolvement in NRC's regulatory activities, that State representativesshould be required to meet the same standards as their NRC counterpartsregarding information disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="81">Opportunity for Public Comment on NRC-State Instruments of CooperationRelating to Inspections at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants</ITAG>The Commission has given considerable thought to the suggestion of someof the industry commenters that potentially affected applicants for NRClicenses and NRC licensees should be notified that their State is pursuingan instrument of cooperation with NRC and be accorded an opportunity, duringongoing negotiations between NRC and the State, to submit public commentson the draft instrument of cooperation before it is finally agreed to byNRC and the State. The Commission recognizes that the subject matter ofthese instruments of cooperation is of great interest to nuclear powerplant applicants and licensees, who are, of course, the entities that willbe inspected.Consistent with Commission practice respecting other types of Federal/Stateagreements, any proposed agreement negotiated by NRC and a State underthe provisions of this policy statement will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public comment. At that time, licensees andother interested persons will have an opportunity to comment on the proposedMemorandum of Understanding or Subagreement before it is executed by NRCand the State in final form.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conclusion</ITAG>For the foregoing reasons and after careful consideration of the commentssubmitted, the Commission has concluded not to change the text of the policystatement as published for comment on June 13, 1988 (53 FR 21981). Accordingly,the Commission hereby adopts and republishes that policy statement as afinal statement of policy. The Commission further declares that the finalstatement of policy in its entirety is effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statement of Policy</ITAG>It is the NRC's policy to cooperate fully with State governments as theyseek to respond to the expectations of their citizens that their healthand safety be protected and that there be minimal impact on the environmentas a result of activities licensed by the NRC. The NRC and the States havecomplementary responsibilities in protecting public health and safety andthe environment. Furthermore, the NRC is committed to the full and timelydisclosure of matters affecting the public and to the fair and uniformhandling of all agency interactions with the States, the public, and NRClicensees.Accordingly, the NRC will continue to keep Governor-appointed State LiaisonOfficers routinely informed on matters of interest to the States. The NRCwill respond in a timely manner to a State's requests for information andits recommendations concerning matter within the NRC's regulatory jurisdiction.If requested, the NRC will routinely inform State Liaison Officers of publicmeetings between NRC and its licensees and applicants in order that Staterepresentatives may attend as observers. Additionally, at the State's request,State representatives will be able to observe specific inspections and/orinspection entrance and exit meetings where State representatives are knowledgeablein radiological health and safety matters.The Commission recognizes that the involvement of qualified State representativesin NRC radiological health and safety programs has the potential for providingadditional safety benefit. Therefore, the NRC will consider State proposalsto enter into instruments of cooperation for State participation in inspectionsand inspection entrance and exit meetings. State participation in NRC programswould allow qualified State representatives, either individually or asa member of a team, to conduct specific inspection activities in accordancewith NRC standards, regulations, and procedures in close cooperation withthe NRC. State activities will normally be conducted under the oversightof an authorized NRC representative with the degree of oversight dependentupon the activity involved. In the proposal to enter into an instrumentof cooperation, the State must identify those activities for which cooperationwith the NRC is desired. The State must propose a program that: (1) Recognizesthe Federal Government, primarily NRC, as having the exclusive authorityand responsibility to regulate the radiological and national security aspectsof the construction and operation of nuclear production or utilizationfacilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted toStates by the Clean Air Act; (2) is in accordance with Federal standardsand regulations; (3) specifies minimum education, experience, training,and qualifications requirements for State representatives which are patternedafter those of NRC inspectors; (4) contains provisions for the findingsof State representatives to be transmitted to NRC for disposition; (5)would not impose an undue burden on the NRC and its licensees and applicants;and (6) abides by NRC protocol not to publicly disclose inspection findingsprior to the release of the NRC inspection report.Consistent with section 274c of the Act, the NRC will not consider Stateproposals for instruments of cooperation that do not include the elementslisted above, which are designed to ensure close cooperation and consistencywith the NRC inspection program. As a practical matter, the NRC is concernedthat independent State inspection programs could direct an applicant'sor licensee's attention to areas not consistent with NRC safety priorities,misinterpret NRC safety requirements, or give the perception of dual regulation.For purposes of this policy statement, an independent State inspectionprogram is one in which State representatives would conduct inspectionsand assess NRC-regulated activities on a State's own initiative and authoritywithout close cooperation with, and oversight by, an authorized NRC representative.Instruments of cooperation between the NRC and the States, approved priorto the date of this policy statement will continue to be honored by theNRC. The NRC strongly encourages those States holding these agreementsto consider modifying them, if necessary, to bring then into conformancewith the provisions of this policy statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Implementation</ITAG>As provided in the policy statement the NRC will routinely keep State LiaisonOfficers informed on matters of interest to the States. In general, allState requests should come from the State Liaison Officer to the appropriateNRC Regional Office. The NRC will make every effort to respond as fullyas possible to all requests from States for information on matters concerningnuclear production or utilization facility safety within 30 days. The NRCwill work to achieve a timely response to State recommendations relatingto the safe operation of nuclear production or utilization facilities.State representatives are free to attend as observers any public meetingbetween the NRC and its applicant and licensees. The appropriate RegionalOffice will routinely inform State Liaison Officers of the scheduling ofpublic meetings upon request. State requests to observe inspections and/orinspection entrance and exit meetings conducted by the NRC require theapproval of the appropriate Regional Administrator.NRC will consider State participation in inspections and the inspectionentrance and exit meetings, where the State-proposed agreement identifiesthe specific inspections they wish to assist NRC with an provides a programcontaining those elements as described in the policy statement. NRC maydevelop inspection plans along with qualified State representatives usingapplicable procedures in the NRC Inspection Manual. Qualified State representativesmay be permitted to perform inspections in cooperation with, and on behalfof, the NRC under the oversight of an authorized NRC representative. Thedegree of oversight provided would depend on the activity. For instance,State representatives may be accompanied by an NRC representative initially,in order to assess the State inspectors' preparedness to conduct the inspectionindividually. Other activities may be conducted as a team with NRC takingthe lead. All enforcement action will be undertaken by the NRC.  The Commission will decide policy matters related to agreements proposedunder this policy statement. Once the Commission has decided the policyon a specific type of agreement, similar State-proposed agreements maybe approved, consistent with Commission policy, by the Executive Directorfor Operations in coordination with the Office of Governmental and PublicAffairs. A State-proposed instrument of cooperation will be documentedin a formal MOU signed by NRC and the State.  Once the NRC has decided to enter into an MOU for State involvement inNRC inspections, a formal review, not less than six months after the effectivedate, will be performed by the NRC to evaluate implementation of the MOUand resolve any problems identified. Final agreements will be subject toperiodic reviews and may be amended or modified upon written agreementby both parties and may be terminated upon 30 days written notice by eitherparty.  Additionally, once State involvement in NRC activities at a nuclear productionor utilization facility is approved by the NRC, the State is responsiblefor meeting all requirements of an NRC licensee and applicant related topersonal safety and unescorted access of State representatives at the site. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of February 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
