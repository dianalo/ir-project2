The New York department store chain said the gain would be reflected in results after the sale, which is scheduled to be completed by Jan. 31, 1990. The store, which is expected to close by next February, accounts for about 4% of Alexander's annual sales. In the year ended July 25, 1987, the company had revenue of $522.9 million and net income of $1.3 million, or 27 cents a share.    Alexander's said the sale is aimed at &quot;maximizing shareholder value.&quot; Interstate Properties, a Paramus, N.J., real estate development concern, and developer Donald Trump together own 54% of Alexander's. </TEXT></DOC>
