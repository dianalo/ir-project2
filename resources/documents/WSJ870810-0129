The change in the Fed's Regulation E, which oversees electronic funds transfers, will take effect Nov. 15.    The rule change was strongly opposed by retail banks. They argue it will drive up their costs while cutting costs for supermarkets, oil companies and other retailers whose debit-card systems allow customers to make purchases through automated payments from a bank account. Under the new rules, banks will have to list more details about a customers' debit-card purchases on monthly bank statements.    Besides adding computer and mailing costs, complained the Consumer Bankers Association, the rule will lead customers to call the bank, rather than the retailer, about billing errors. However, the Fed said it will require retailers to print their name, address or phone number on debit cards and receipts to cut down on complaints to banks.    By exempting merchants and other non-bank card issuers from sending monthly statements, the rule change is expected to boost use of debit cards. Exxon Corp., for example, has just announced a new debit card for gasoline purchases. There are an estimated 130 million electronic-transfer cards already in circulation, and experts expect the number to balloon.    Specifically, the retail banks object to debit-card systems that use automated clearing houses to process transactions. They prefer dealing with debit-card systems set up by agreement directly with a bank; it gives the bank more control over use and billing, but it is more costly for retailers.    However, some in the banking industry, chiefly those with interests in clearing houses, supported the change.    Banks won't be required to print the exact location of the debit transaction on statements until mid-1990. Small banks, with less than $25 million in assets, won't have to comply with nearly all of the new requirements until July 1, 1990.    The rules also extend the time a customer can report a lost or stolen debit card -- and incur no more than $50 in liability -- to four days from two, and give customers 90 days, instead of 60, to report billing errors. </TEXT></DOC>
