First Nationwide, a $26 billion savings bank whose parent isowned by Ford Motor Co., said the planned March 10 closings are partof ``a more focused strategy'' that has seen the company acquirefailed thrift institutions with billions of dollars in assets inrecent months.   ``We regarded it as an experiment, and it just hasn't met whatour expectations were,'' said Lorna Doubet, a First Nationwidespokeswoman. ``It just hasn't attracted as many customers as we hadthought it would.''   First Nationwide had the 170 convenience branches in Arizona,California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The branchesaccounted for about $200 million in deposits, compared with morethan $17 billion for the company's entire system, which alsoincluded outlets in Hawaii, Illinois and New Jersey.   ``Although we learned much about offering financial services in aretail environment, we have concluded that convenience branches in Kmarts don't fit the company's new strategic focus on its targetmarkets and profitable operations,'' said Robert C. Lackovic,chairman and chief executive officer of the San Francisco-basedsavings bank.   ``K mart has given us strong support and we have an excellentrelationship, but the bank has found it necessary to change itspriorities,'' Lackovic said.   Late in December, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board pledged $1.6billion to assist First Nationwide Financial Corp., the savingsbank's parent, in the purchase of four failed savings and loans inthree states with assets of nearly $8 billion. When merged withFirst Nationwide Bank, the company will have the nation'ssecond-biggest thrift business.   First Nationwide failed in its September bid to acquire AmericanSavings and Loan Association, of Stockton, Calif., the nation'sbiggest insolvent thrift.   Jon Hartman, director of financial services for Troy, Mich.-basedK mart Corp., said the company had known for some time that resultsat the branches were ``not as good as they could have been.'' Healso said the thrift recent acquisitions by First Nationwide hadsignaled the shift in their strategy.   ``I think what probably transpired is that we all thought thiswas a good idea and there are situations where it can and hasworked, but it appears in talking with the bank that it's notsomething that can be rolled out nationwide,'' Hartman said.   First Nationwide accounts in the K mart branches will betransferred to full-service offices, and affected customers will benotified this week by mail.   Ms. Doubet said about 350 employees would be affected by theclosings and First Nationwide was attempting to find new positionswith the company for many of them.</TEXT></DOC>
