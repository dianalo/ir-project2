The applicability of fibres available at presentis considerably restricted by their properties. For instance, only glassand gas-phase-deposited SiC can be usefully and economically strengthenedwith the thermically unstable PCS-SiC fibre. Indeed, in a good numberof cases, the C fibre produces excellent composite properties, but itsoxidation resistance requires a complete coating of the finished componentwith a protective layer which is resistant to oxidation. Silicon-ceramicwhiskers offer a way out of the situation. The fact that their processingin ceramic masses is less complicated opens up future prospects for them.</TEXT></DOC>
