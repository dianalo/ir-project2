Arriving at an elaborate White House welcoming ceremony, Mr. Gorbachev made it clear that he regards the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty as &quot;the first step down the road leading to a nuclear-free world.&quot; But he reiterated his demand that reductions in long-range missiles must be linked to restraints on missile defenses such as those contemplated by Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.    &quot;I have come to Washington with the intention of advancing the next and more important goal of reaching agreement to reduce, by half, strategic offensive arms in the context of a firm guarantee of strategic stability,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev told a gathering of American and Soviet officials, celebrities and school children on the South Lawn of the White House.    Mr. Reagan seemed upbeat about the prospects for further arms reductions, but he sprinkled his public remarks, both when he welcomed Mr. Gorbachev to the White House and after the two leaders signed the INF treaty, with notes of caution about the prospects for a quick thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.    &quot;Let us have the courage to recognize that there are weighty differences between our governments and systems -- differences that will not go away by wishful thinking or expressions of good will, no matter how sincerely delivered,&quot; the president said.    Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev opened the summit by meeting alone for nearly an hour before summoning small groups of aides. According to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, the two leaders immediately turned to substantive issues, including controls on long-range, or strategic, arms and human rights.    The leaders formed a working group of lower-ranking officials to deal with arms control and another to address human rights, regional conflicts and bilateral issues.    Mr. Reagan seemed intent on setting a harmonious tone for the discussions. At the outset of their talks, Mr. Fitzwater said, the president gave Mr. Gorbachev a set of solid gold cuff links that picture the Biblical prophet Isaiah beating swords into plowshares. Mr. Reagan wore an identical set of cuff links to the meeting, Mr. Fitzwater added.    Later, a U.S. official said, the two leaders had another private chat beside a White House fireplace and agreed to refer to each other by their first names, rather than the formal &quot;Mr. President&quot; and &quot;Mr. General Secretary&quot; they had used before.    &quot;On balance, it was a day of positive, productive discussion,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater told reporters. By the end of the day, he said, both leaders felt &quot;the foundation had been laid for substantial progress&quot; on a variety of issues. He said the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile, or ABM, treaty, and Mr. Reagan's missile defense program -- two crucial issues dividing the superpowers -- were &quot;mentioned&quot; in several discussions but weren't specifically discussed.    Although Mr. Gorbachev earlier sought specific restraints on SDI testing and development, he recently has softened his tone and begun insisting only that the U.S. honor a narrow interpretation of the ABM treaty. The Reagan administration has advocated a more liberal interpretation of the 1972 accord.    Experts don't agree about whether accepting Mr. Gorbachev's stricter interpretation would seriously hamper the so-called Star Wars program. Some U.S. officials hope the summit produces a compromise that would pave the way for 50% cuts in strategic arms arsenals, while permitting the bulk of the SDI program to go forward.    Asked whether Mr. Gorbachev had made specific new arms-control proposals, Mr. Fitzwater declined to answer, but he said, &quot;The discussions were specific on points.&quot;    He said human rights issues occupied a major part of the two leaders' first meeting, and that another divisive issue, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, will be on the agenda today.    Mr. Gorbachev, meanwhile, took time out from his meetings with the president to try to convince Americans that the superpowers have an unprecedented opportunity to replace conflict with cooperation and that he is sincere in his desire to reform Soviet society and foreign policy. Late yesterday afternoon, he gave a long, animated talk to a group of American intellectuals, stressing that Soviet and American leaders must heed their peoples' desire for improved relations. The speech was televised.    Speaking at the Soviet Embassy to an audience that included author Norman Mailer, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, evangelist Billy Graham and Yoko Ono, the widow of Beatle John Lennon, Mr. Gorbachev said that both Soviet and U.S. politicians are &quot;lagging behind&quot; the sentiments of their own people.    &quot;We are living in a time of new reality,&quot; he said, and he appealed to his listeners to press American leaders to seize what he described as a historic opportunity to improve East-West relations.    He read a letter he said he had received from a 17-year-old American girl, who wrote: &quot;Many Americans mistrust Russians. Many Russians distrust Americans . . . I feel there is something wrong with this.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev added, &quot;What we need is a policy that can express the mood, the sentiment, of the people. Until now, we have only thought of upholding our own interests.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev described the newly signed INF treaty as &quot;a turning point&quot; marking the beginning of a new chapter in superpower relations. He said he &quot;couldn't understand those who have taken up cudgels against it.&quot;    The treaty, which was made public after it was signed and must be ratified by the Senate, would require the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to destroy a total of 2,611 medium and shorter-range missiles within three years, and it would provide for the most ambitious verification arrangements in history, U.S. officials said. American and Soviet officials would remain on each other's soil for 13 years to make sure neither side is secretly producing missiles banned by the agreement.    &quot;We'll visit every base and every production facility,&quot; U.S. negotiator Maynard Glitman told reporters.    The treaty would create a Special Verification Commission to referee disputes. Unlike the current Standing Consultative Commission, which critics charge has been powerless to correct violations of past arms treaties, the new panel could be convened on short notice, instead of at scheduled intervals, Mr. Glitman said.    Officials didn't release a memorandum of understanding accompanying the treaty, which contains the details of the nuclear forces to be scrapped -- including numbers of missiles, lists of bases where they are deployed, and technical data. U.S. officials didn't say why the memorandum wasn't made public.    Some lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), have said they are waiting to review such details before deciding whether to support ratification of the treaty.    Neither side, however, was eager to highlight such complications. Gennady Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, called it &quot;an historic day.&quot; He said he telephoned his wife and said she reported that it was &quot;almost a celebration in Moscow.&quot; Added the Soviet spokesman: &quot;Everyone was very moved by what happened here.&quot;    ---   Peter Gumbel contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
