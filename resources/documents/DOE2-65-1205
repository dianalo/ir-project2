The most prominent cost factors were energyand work. The conservation of the original quality level demands 0.3-0.8per cent yearly investments measured from replacement value. An efficientenergy use is often prevented by non-technical reasons. The problemsare clutched with organizations, administration, contracts, information,motivation, work orientation and quidance besides education and wages.Energy conservations can be achieved without comfort decrease by automationof operation activities, well planned and drafted activities of operationand service inspection. The achieved energy conservations were about10 per cent. Adaption of new methods and organization reform are in question.The project has applied the idea of measuring maintenance which has beenlended from industry and is based on reliability in running and economicviability. The payback period of control and monitoring systems on residentialareas was about 6 years with 6 per cent interest. In the areas with miscellaneusreal properties the payback periods were 5-8 years. The payback periodsof office and business real properties were 2-5 years. The most profitableobjects of making automatic were time controls, alarms and measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
