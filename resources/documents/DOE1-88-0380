Together these countries accountfor around three-fourths of total energy use in Latin America. LatinAmerican energy use accounts for over 10 percent of the world's total,40 percent of the LDC total, and has grown at an average yearly rateof 4.8 percent since 1973. The analysis is based on energy and economicdata prepared for the Developing Country Data Series developed by theInternational Energy Studies Group of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (IES-LBL).Data were obtained from local sources during visits to government offices,academic research institutions, and from the private sector. We firstdiscuss aggregate trends in energy demand in the 1970--1984 period. Wethen look separately at the four major sectors: industry, transportation,residential/commerical, and power generation. In these sections we focuson change in energy and oil intensity and the structural causes for thosechanges. 6 refs., 3 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
