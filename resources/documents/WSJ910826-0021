The subcommittee is also trying to determine whetherfederal farm loan guarantees were used to finance thepurchase of Kennametal's tools by Iraq for use in its&quot;supergun&quot; project.</LP><TEXT>   Kennametal's involvement first surfaced in an indictmentagainst Banca Nationale del Lavoro of Italy, whose Atlantabranch was closed by federal authorities in connection withthe charges. Among other things, the 347-count indictment,returned by a federal grand jury in Atlanta in February,cites fraudulent BNL letters of credit used by Kennametal tosell alleged military-related hardware to Iraq.   &quot;The Justice Department has failed to adequatelyinvestigate the role Kennametal played in providing partscritical not only to the Iraqi war machine, but also to thebuilding of the so-called supergun,&quot; said Rep. Charles Rose(D., N.C.) and Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D., Conn.), who areleading the subcommittee hearings.   Adds Rep. Rose: &quot;I believe Kennametal was shipping eithermilitary or multiple-use products without getting thenecessary permits and benefiting from agricultural fundsthrough its relationship with BNL.&quot;   For its part, Kennametal, one of the nation's largestmachine tool makers, said that while it had done somebusiness with Iraqi agents prior to Iraq's invasion ofKuwait, it hasn't found any &quot;illegalities, improprieties orquestionable practices&quot; in these transactions, which are saidby investigators to have occurred over a three-year periodbeginning in 1987.   Prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, it was not illegal tosell military hardware to Iraq. However, export declarationswere required; investigators believe that Kennametal may haveeither falsified export declarations or failed to apply forthem.   The Latrobe, Pa., concern is under scrutiny because of thesensitivity of its technology. Its core product, which itpatented 53 years ago, is tungsten carbide, one of just twoknown materials used for piercing armor. When an artilleryshell strikes a tank, for instance, the carbide containedinside is hard enough to remain intact, piercing the armorand allowing the explosive to flow through the hole.   U.S. investigators believe the Iraqis persistently triedto obtain tungsten carbide cutting tools to make munitions,and also the technology to build a tungsten carbide plant ofits own. Kennametal says it got out of the tank-penetratorbusiness in 1986, but still makes tungsten parts for grenadesfor the U.S. Defense Department, and supplies metalworkingproducts to defense contractors.   In sworn testimony Aug. 1 in Washington, a formerKennametal staff attorney alleged that Kennametal hadconducted a deliberate scheme to circumvent U.S. export lawand hide its dealings with Iraq. Among other things, MarianneGasior, the attorney, said the company had illegally arrangedfor the shipment of its products through third countries andhad kept records of certain wire transfers separate fromregular Kennametal books.   &quot;Kennametal had a significant role in the Iraqi armsprocurement network, both in terms of its directsurreptitious relationships with Iraqi agents, as well as itssupply agreements with other companies who, in turn, weresupplying the network,&quot; Ms. Gasior told the subcommittee.   In one instance, Ms. Gasior said, she was asked in January1990 to collect money due Kennametal for the sale of carbidemetalworking products to Iraq. &quot;In this BNL financedtransaction, Kennametal was dealing directly with an Iraqiagent in Atlanta, . . . and Kennametal arranged to have theproduct transshipped through Germany . . . to Iraq,&quot; shesaid.   According to documents obtained by Defense Departmentinvestigators, the products were shipped in July 1989 fromGermany to Iraq's State Machinery Trade Co. in Baghdad.Investigators believe this shipment was part of a much biggerorder. Moreover, the BNL letter of credit that financed thesale is among those cited by the Justice Department in itsindictment of BNL.   In her testimony, Ms. Gasior, who left Kennametal inJanuary 1990 and claims to have been harassed by the companysince then, said she was told by a Kennametal employee of thecompany's involvement in production of the supergun. That gunwas the brainchild of Gerard Bull, a Canadian born artilleryspecialist and Iraqi arms agent who was murdered in Brusselslast year. Kennametal acknowledges that it sold metalworkingproducts to Matrix Churchill Ltd., the British concern ownedby Iraq that built the gun. But the company said it didn'tknow how the products were used.   &quot;It was the responsibility of Matrix to comply with allexport licensing requirements,&quot; Kennametal said in astatement. &quot;Unknown to Kennametal or its U.K. subsidiary, itappears that Matrix was supplying false information to theBritish authorities to obtain an export license.&quot;   Ms. Gasior also claimed that Kennametal's Raleigh, N.C.,office shipped tens of thousands of carbide cutting toolsdirectly to the Iraqi Embassy in Washington from 1987 to1989. Although Kennametal said it hasn't found any record ofthese sales, it has uncovered other direct sales to Iraq.They include the sale in July or August 1989 of $81,917 ofmetalworking tools to Al-Kadesiah State Establishment, anIraqi entity.   Rep. Rose said the subcommittee will reconvene inSeptember and plans to call at least two other formeremployees who have come forth to testify, as well as severalcompany executives.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          The Justice Department in February indicted officers ofBanca Nazionale del Lavoro's Atlanta branch; the bank was notclosed by the department and was not indicted. In the Aug. 12edition, the department's actions were misstated.   (WSJ Aug. 26, 1991)   910812-0125</TEXT></DOC>
