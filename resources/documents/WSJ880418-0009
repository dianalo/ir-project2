Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN REL BNK CON </IN><TEXT>   After months of decline, fixed mortgage rates are on the rise again, but the increase would have to accelerate before it seriously hurt the currently healthy level of new and existing home sales.    According to surveys of about 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates, a Riverdale, N.J., publisher of mortgage information, average fixed 30-year rates paid by home buyers hit a 1988 low of 9.95% early last month, but have risen more than a quarter percentage point since then. The jump in rates in the bond market last week means many lenders will increase fixed mortgage rates further this week. Investors who buy mortgages demand yields at certain spreads above Treasury bond rates.    On Friday, yields required by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the big government buyer of mortgages, rose to a level nearly a half percentage point higher on 30-year loans, and more than a half a percentage point higher on 15-year loans, compared with levels several weeks ago.    &quot;These (fixed mortgage) rates will be a solid quarter point higher (today),&quot; said Richard Plume, a mortgage-loan broker for Bayporte Financial, Foster City, Calif. Paul Havemann, an HSH vice president, says that among lenders, &quot;the general feeling is that rates are due to go up over the next few weeks.&quot;    The upward tick reverses a trend of sharply lower fixed rates that began after the Oct. 19 stock-market crash. As the Federal Reserve Board eased monetary policy to provide liquidity, bond-market yields fell and mortgage rates fell about two percentage points. The lower rates have helped foster a rebound in housing starts and home sales.    The rise in fixed rates hasn't yet significantly dulled the appetite of would-be home buyers, according to lenders, real-estate agents and home builders, who say rates are still below the point at which consumer resistance stiffens.    Indeed, the recent rise, and the prospect of more to come, caused a flurry of inquiries from loan seekers late last week, said Mr. Plume. &quot;When (consumers) hear rates are going up, that's when it gets busy,&quot; he said.    Moreover, savings and loan associations, the main housing lenders, have been flooded with deposits since the stock-market crash. They are competing to put the money out in loans, placing a drag on the rise in fixed rates.    &quot;There's lot of money around,&quot; said Joseph Wahed, chief economist at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a unit of Wells Fargo andamp; Co. &quot;People are hungry to make loans.&quot;    Also, the thrifts and many other lenders offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with initial below-market rates and other terms attractive to home buyers. Lenders predict home buyers will switch to adjustable-rate mortgages in droves if fixed rates jump significantly higher than 10%, as they did in the prior three years.    &quot;On fixed-rate loans, we're gong to hit resistance right away,&quot; says Paul Miller, a senior vice president for Crossland Mortgage Corp., Salt Lake City. &quot;You get more than 10%, and people will go for the ARMs.&quot; Crossland boosted its fixed rates by a quarter percentage point last week.    But most adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to indexes of short-term interest rates, and they too have been rising lately. If that trend continues, market rates for adjustable-rate mortgages will also soon exceed 10%. The outcome for home sales and construction will depend largely on how long and how far interest rates increase.    Fundamental economic pressure means, &quot;We're probably past the bottom of rates for the year,&quot; said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.    But economists warned that the rate spike last week may be a panicky overreaction to misleading balance-of-trade figures, and that mortgage and other rates might settle back later. Most expect an erractic, upward trend in mortgages for the rest of the year, but not one of the magnitude of 1987, when rates rose 2 1/2 percentage points between April and October. </TEXT></DOC>
