Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 20.25 cents a bushel to $5.71. Corn futures followed suit, with the September contract falling 6.25 cents to $2.2775 a bushel.    Traders focused on the weather after the Agriculture Department late last week released its first survey of 1989 crop conditions, which projected smaller-than-expected gains in grain and soybean production. The department predicted a 24% increase in soybean output to 1.91 billion bushels.    The department forecast a corn harvest of 7.35 billion bushels, a 49% jump from last year's harvest, which was devastated by drought.    Although the crop report triggered moderate gains last week, &quot;we probably will see volatile trading {this week} as we try to assess the weather,&quot; said Mickey Luth, a soybean analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.    Some traders concluded that the gains after the crop report weren't warranted, Mr. Luth said. The market was &quot;giving back those gains which weren't economically justified,&quot; he said. Mr. Luth also cited poor demand as a cause of yesterday's declines.    The unexpected rains over the weekend brought timely and beneficial moisture to the soybean crop, which has entered its &quot;maximum water usage time,&quot; said Mario Balletto, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York.    After the futures markets closed yesterday, the National Weather Service issued its closely watched, six-day to 10-day forecast. It predicted above-normal temperatures and normal rainfall in Iowa and Minnesota, and above-normal rainfall in Illinois.    But for the next few days, the service is predicting thunderstorms through much of the Corn Belt, eastern Iowa and northern Indiana and Illinois.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: The rally that started in early July continued. The September contract finished 3 cents higher at $1.20 a pound. Ben Bowdon, vice-president of metals management at the Essex Group Inc. in Fort Wayne, Ind., one of the largest copper consumers in the U.S., noted that this rally has continued without a correction since July 6, when the price of spot copper dropped to 99.60 cents. &quot;If there is going to be a recession we certainly don't see it in our order books,&quot; he said. &quot;The supply of copper on both a spot and contract basis is there, but so is the demand.&quot; He said copper consumption is much higher than he thought possible for this time of the year. He also pointed out that the price at the London Metal Exchange has been running consistently six to seven cents a pound higher than at New York's Commodity Exchange. As a result, he said, copper may be flowing out of the U.S. to those places that base their prices on LME prices. John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp; Associates, a consulting firm to the metals industry, New York, noted that LME stocks dropped 975 metric tons last week, while Comex copper stocks were down 658 tons on a week-to-week basis. In addition to falling stocks and low stock levels Mr. Gross said he believed the current rally was being spurred, in part, by the strike of copper workers in Peru, New Guinea and British Columbia. He noted that on Friday the market broke through technical resistance at $1.14 a pound for the September contract. He said, &quot;Today {yesterday} we saw follow-through buying and more short covering. I think the market looks much more attractive from a speculative point of view.&quot;    SUGAR: Profit-taking snuffed Friday's rally. The October contract fell 0.79 cent to 13.63 cents a pound. Erik Dunlaevy, sugar analyst at Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., New York, said the collapse was no more than liquidation by speculators. He pointed out that there were lots of stop-loss orders just under the 13.75-cents-a-pound level, last week's low price, and the market reached it just before the close. The market collapsed, he said, because &quot;too many people got too long, too early.&quot; He said he thinks the market will continue to work higher but declined to predict just how high it would go. &quot;In any bull market the final peak is determined by the {speculators}. They are the ones who will carry it the last one cent or the last 10 cents.&quot; Judith Ganes, soft-commodity specialist at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said the market ran up last week partly on rumors that India had bought 250,000 tons of sugar, but Monday, those rumors were proven false. &quot;Third-World countries cannot afford to buy much sugar at these prices, but any pullback will provide them an opportunity to do some purchasing,&quot; she said. Ms. Ganes said that the bull market isn't over, but that the investors who have taken long positions won't have an easy time achieving the higher prices. Ms. Ganes also said there is some technical support for the market at the 13-cent level. &quot;The more pullback we get,&quot; she said, the more physical sugar will be purchased &quot;and the higher the rally will ultimately go.&quot;    COTTON: The selloff that started on Friday continued. The December contract fell 1.46 cents a pound to 73.74. The heavy selling was prompted by rain in West Texas. Judith Ganes, soft-commodity specialist at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said that while the weather in Texas was looking good, the Delta appears to be both too dry and too cool for development of the crop. December had set a life-of-contract high price of 76.95 cents a pound on Friday before a weather report around midday forecast rains over the weekend. But Ms. Ganes said this decline could prompt export sales of U.S. cotton. She also said that, initially, the selloff was prompted by profit-taking but that as the decline continued, some holders of long positions were forced to leave the market. </TEXT></DOC>
