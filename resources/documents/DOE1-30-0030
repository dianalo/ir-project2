As follows:1) test operation study, 2) operation study and 3) improvement studyare summerized; 1) Test operation study---The following works were carriedout; a) Technical assessment of the process concerned; Wafer handling,confirmation of manufacturing conditions and cell experiments using CZwafers, and experiment of assessing connectability of leads. b) Assessmentof cast cell; Handling of cast wafers, confirmation of manufacturingconditions and cell experiments using cast wafers. c) Assessment of ribboncell, and d) Establishment of life-time measuring standard, etc.. 2)Operation study. a) Stabilization of the conditions concerning productionline using SOG cast cells; It was confirmed that control of exact temperatureand the inner atmosphere during the heat treatment process, and controlof film thickness during the antireflection film forming process arethe important items. b) SOB ribbon cell; Automatic operation became feasible,however it was confirmed that improvement of the surface condition ofribbon base plates and improvement of the facilities are necessary. 3)Examination of possible improvement of process; Improvement of cell characteristics,reduction of the number of unit process, increase of production speedand improvement of ion inputting device etc. were examined.</TEXT></DOC>
