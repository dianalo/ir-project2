In September 1938, Czechoslovakia's allies Britain and Francebowed to German pressure and agreed to Hitler's annexation ofCzechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland region, nearlyone-third of the nation's territory.   Any Western hopes that appeasement would dissuade Hitler fromall-out war on eastern Europe ended Germany invaded the rest ofCzechoslovakia on March 15, 1939.   Less than half a year later, Hitler's army rolled across Polishborders, and World War II began.   The Czechoslovak invasion was inevitable, independent historianMilos Hajek said in an interview.   ``Hitler's intentions were quite clear'' after the annexation, hesaid. ``The strategy of (the Czech) government was to make maximumconcessions to Hitler, but even that didn't pay off.''   Another Czech, a 25-year-old left-wing student at the time, said:``The greatest mistake was that they (Prague leaders) believed inthe West, which proved to be so weak.''   When Germany swallowed Austria on March 12, 1938, hundreds ofthousands feted the arriving troops.   In Prague and other Czech towns, none cheered.   Witnesses in Prague recalled that citizens retreated to sidestreets to hide their shame and disgust. Others confronted theinvaders with clenched fists and shouted abuse.   ``I remember the weather was awful _ sleet and rain _ and I canstill see the German bombers hovering above Prague, which was quitea feat in those days with that kind of weather,'' said the formerstudent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``I said to myself, what would it be like if there was war today.This must perhaps be better,'' he added.   The last meeting of the Czechoslovak government in Prague washeld on March 9, 1939. State President Emil Hacha ordered the ousterof the Slovak government after its dissident leaders negotiated withGerman and Austrian Nazis.   A day later, Hitler decided to invade, and German troops wereordered to take up positions by the evening of March 12.   After the Czechoslovak government received word of Hitler's plan,Hacha and Foreign Minister Frantisek Chvalkovsky traveled to Berlinlate on March 14. They met with Hitler, who told them their homelandwould be invaded.   Hacha suffered a fainting attack after the meeting. A short timelater, he and Chvalkovsky signed a document imposed on them byHitler.   ``The Czechoslovak state president has declared that he .... laysthe fate of the Czech people and country trustfully into the handsof the Fuehrer of the German Reich,'' it said.   When Nazi troops had taken over Czechoslovakia, an ecstaticHitler ordered his two secretaries: ``Now, you kids give me a kisshere and here,'' pointing to his cheeks, one of the women laterrecalled.</TEXT></DOC>
