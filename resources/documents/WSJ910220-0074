Phelan Jr. received a retirementpackage of about $10 million when he stepped down last monthas chairman and chief executive officer of the New York StockExchange, people close to the exchange said yesterday.   The size of the pension award, first reported in industrytrade publications such as Investment Dealers' Digest,surprised some Wall Street securities executives, because theBig Board is in the midst of a major cost-cutting drive. BigBoard officials stressed that the chairman's retirement awardis not specifically a &quot;bonus&quot; voted on by the exchange'sboard, but part of a retirement package determined by a setformula used for all employees who contract with theexchange. The formula, they said, is based on length ofservice and annual compensation, among other factors.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Phelan, 59 years old, was vice chairman of the BigBoard from 1975 to 1980; president and chief operatingofficer from 1980 to 1984; and chairman and chief executivestarting in May 1984. By the end of his six years aschairman, he was earning an annual salary of about $1million. Mr. Phelan, who couldn't be reached for commentyesterday, has been in the securities industry for 35 years,starting as a Big Board floor trader.   &quot;There is no such thing as a retirement bonus,&quot; saidRichard A. Grasso, president of the Big Board, who declinedto confirm the amount of Mr. Phelan's pension package.&quot;Whatever he got was pursuant to the formula that applies toall employees in the exchange benefit programs,&quot; Mr. Grassosaid.   Securities executives say the $10 million pension packageis comparable to what the chief executive of a major WallStreet brokerage firm might receive. Still, the $10 millionretirement package has produced grumbling among some tradersand board members at the exchange. It comes at a time whenthe Big Board is cutting 350 jobs, or about 18% of all staff,through early retirement and dismissals. The Big Board alsoimposed a freeze on officer salaries late last year, at whichtime Mr. Phelan called for &quot;careful management of costs andthe most efficient use of resources&quot; at the exchange.   Mr. Phelan was widely praised for improving the exchange'stechnology and deftly handling various crises, including the1987 stock-market crash. Since retiring, Mr. Phelan hasjoined Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s board as an outside director.   After announcing his retirement last year, Mr. Phelandenied persistent rumors he was considering a government jobin Washington. He said his interest after leaving theexchange were in the areas of &quot;charity, education andbusiness.&quot; He was succeeded as Big Board chairman and chiefexecutive by William H. Donaldson, one of the co-founders ofthe securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette SecuritiesCorp.</TEXT></DOC>
