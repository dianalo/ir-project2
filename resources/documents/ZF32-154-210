 Most clip-art libraries include a map or two.andP;  These are finefor decoration, but if you want to show sales territories, distributionnetworks or office locations in detail, you'll need a more comprehensiveselection.andM;Fortunately, a number of vendors sell libraries made up solely of maps.andO;These range from the generic to the ultraspecific.andP;  U.S.andP;  state maps are easyto come by, and two of four packages we reviewed also offer internationalmaps.andP;  But counties, highways, ZIP codes, and other more detailed regionsthat you might need are less common.andM;While there's much to be said for having the world at your disposal, it's notmuch of a world if you can't change it.andP;  All these maps come in editablevector formats, so once you pull them into your graphics package you canrecolor and resize the regions to your heart's content.andP;  But not all of themare grouped in the same way, and most come in only a single format.andM;COMPREHENSIVE APPROACHandM;The winner for the widest array of maps is Lotus Freelance Maps.andP;  This $395package includes a large selection of U.S.andP;  maps, which show an unusualamount of information-not just counties, but cities, area codes, ZIP codes,major highways.andP;  and three kinds of statistical areas  MetropolitanStatistical Areas, Nielsen's Designated Market Area, and Arbitron's Areas ofDominant Influence).andP;  The international series includes three perspectives ofworld maps, as well as continents and countries with boundaries and highlydetailed maps of Canada.andM;All the maps are highly detailed, and since they work as a series ofoverlays, you can have as much detail on a single map as you desire.andP;  Maps ofthe same area are not always drawn at the same size, though; for example, thenational area code map is not the same size as the national state outlinemap, making it difficult to overlay one with the other.andP;  You can arrangeitems in regional groups or combine them with data-driven or text charts.andO;The maps come in black and white, so you must recolor the regions to suityourself.andM;The main drawback to this otherwise fine package is that it comes only inFreelance Plus's native DRW format, which isn't widely supported.andP;  If youhave Freelance Plus, though, you can take advantage of its exportcapabilities to get the maps into something more widely useful.andM;GEOGRAPHIC LAYERS MicroGrafx U.S.andP;  Maps Special Edition ($149.95) takes asimilar layered approach to map organization.andP;  These maps, which are providedin Micrografx's proprietary DRW format for use with its Designer.andP;  Charisma,and Draw Plus graphics packages, arrange the various elements in layers, allof which are visible when you open a file.andP;  For example, when you first openthe map of the United States, you see the overall border, state divisions,state and city names, the map key, and all bodies of water, each of whichconstitutes a layer.andP;  You then use Designer's layer manager to select onlythe elements that you want to display onscreen.andM;This package includes a map of the continental U.S.andP;  plus Alaska, Hawaii, andPuerto Rico in insets (none of the other packages consider Puerto Rico partof the United States); state maps with cities and counties; region maps; andan outline map with a superimposed American flag.andP;  The maps are attractiveand easy to manipulate, though some states (for example, New Hampshire andVermont) share one map.andP;  You can remove the unwanted state from your map, butyou'll have to select each of its various layers to do so.andM;Micrografx's map collection falls down in the documentation department aswell.andP;  You must discover what maps are included by looking at them one byone.andP;  There's no paper catalog of the, maps, only a utility called Portfoliothat lets you copy or save maps to the Windows clipboard or print uneditedmaps.andM;A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE You won't have that problem with Kinetic's U.S.andO;Maps-3D  $195).andP;  This package includes 50 individual state maps and 44 imagesof the United States in CGM format, drawn with an interestingthree-dimensional effect.andP;  They come in a variety of perspectives, tilts, androtations; you could even display them in sequence to create a limited slideanimation of the map turning.andP;  The downside is that they're intended for useas images; they lack even labels.andM;As you'd expect, these maps are designed for use with Kinetic Words, Graphs andamp;Art, a fact made clear through the extensive tutorial.andP;  A well-kept secret,revealed on the last page of the manual, is that you can import the maps intoFreelance Plus as well.andP;  If you do so, however, you lose some of thecapabilities available under Kinetic Words.andP;  Graphs andamp; Art, such as theability to alter the shapes of the states.andP;  It's also a bit difficult to seewhat's selected under Freelance, complicating the recoloring process.andM;Ostensibly, the individual 3-D state maps snap together like puzzle pieces toform regions.andP;  In practice this proved more thud than snap.andP;  The pieces neverseemed to fit without overlapping or leaving gaps and protruding bits of dropshadow.andP;  THE WORLD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS MicroMaps' MapArt ($179) puts itsemphasis on the world.andP;  It includes two projections of world maps, plusregional maps and detailed country maps, all drawn in editable EPS formatthat can be used with almost any drawing or desktop publishing package.andO;There are also bitmapped versions of the maps in.PCX format.andM;The maps are beautiful, and easy to work with since each type of objectwithin a map (country borders, state borders, country names, and so forth) isorganized as a group.andP;  The downside is that the maps are very complex anddetailed, and you could wait an eternity for files to be read into yourdrawing package.andP;  You can spend the waiting time reading the documentation,which fortunately is very thorough and makes it easy to find what you need.andM;Once you've finished importing, you'll need to start ungrouping the objects.andO;This can be a time-consuming task since the objects are arrangedhierarchically.andP;  For example, to delete city names from the map of Australia,you'll first have to ungroup the country from the initial groups-countryborders and name-into the additional groups of territory borders and names,then ungroup the territories to get to the city location points and names.andO;You can then either delete all the city names as a group or break down thisgroup even further to delete only a particular city.andM;Freelance Maps, Version 3.0andM;Lotus Development Corp., 55andM;Cambridge Pkwy., Cambridge, MAandM;02142;
