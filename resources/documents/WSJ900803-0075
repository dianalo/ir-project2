Over the past 30 years, tiny Kuwait has poured its oilwealth into an investment portfolio spread around the world.Yesterday, the U.S., Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assetsin their respective countries to prevent their seizure byIraq. And Switzerland moved in that direction by orderingSwiss banks to reject any withdrawals of Kuwaiti assets thatseem suspicious.</LP><TEXT>   Much of Kuwait's global portfolio is controlled by theLondon-based Kuwait Investment Office, renowned as much forits secrecy as for its wealth. The investment office hasnever disclosed finances, but analysts peg the value of itsassets at about $100 billion.   They range from major stakes in big German industrialcompanies to Malaysian plantations to smaller positions inU.S. concerns. In an uncharacteristically bold move, theinvestment office rocked British political and businesscircles in 1987 when it began amassing a stake of almost 22%in British Petroleum Co., since cut to 9.8%. The Kuwaitisalso have been the most prominent foreign investors in Spain.   &quot;They've been one of the largest single, identifiableinvestors in world markets,&quot; says Richard O'Brien, chiefeconomist at American Express Bank in London. Aside from theBP foray, he adds, the Kuwaitis generally have been passive,long-term investors. &quot;They're not just a short-term,hot-money speculator.&quot;   Kuwait established the investment office in London in the1950s, with a mission to invest oil profits for the benefitof future generations when the oil runs out. The office grewinto a heavyweight in the 1970s, as then-booming oil pricespoured billions into its coffers. In recent years, investmentincome has contributed more to national revenue than has oil.   The fund's growth was masterminded from nondescriptoffices in the City, London's financial district. Nothing onthe outside of the Kuwait Investment Office's headquartersbuilding facing St. Paul's Cathedral indicates it is home foranything other than a tuxedo-rental shop. The entrance to thelavishly furnished offices above the shop is marked only withthe building's address.   Yesterday, a heavyset security guard stood in front of theentrance, turning away visitors. He refused to say whetheranyone was inside. The curtains at every window in theseven-story structure were drawn.   The office's most visible investment was the BP stake,amassed in late 1987 and early 1988. The Kuwaitis snapped upshares in Britain's biggest company after the U.K.government's disastrous public offering of its 31.7% BP stakein late 1987. Although the Kuwaiti office initially insistedit was a long-term investor in BP, British officials frettedthat the oil-rich Arab country eventually might try tocontrol the U.K.'s main oil producer.   The row threatened the two nations' historically closediplomatic and trading relations. Eventually, the Britishgovernment ordered a partial divestiture of the stake, adecision the Kuwaiti spokesmen greeted with &quot;extreme regretand astonishment.&quot; Shortly afterward, in January 1989, BPagreed to buy most of the stake back from the Kuwaitis for#2.41 billion (valued at $4.37 billion at the time). TheKuwaitis retain 9.8% of BP.   The BP imbroglio may well account for the Kuwaiti office'srecent management shake-up, its biggest in years. InFebruary, longtime London-based director Fouad Jaffar -- anurbane, Western-educated Kuwaiti who had masterminded thefund's growth -- was succeeded by Sheikh Fahd Mohammedal-Sabah, a member of the royal family. Under Mr. Jaffar'sleadership, the investment office had become more aggressive,moving in and out of stocks quickly.   In the U.S., the Kuwait Investment Office has tended tohold its investments below disclosure thresholds. But reportsfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicatethat, as of February 1989, the investment office had a 5.8%stake in Knogo Corp., a Hauppauge, N.Y., maker of securitydevices. Santa Fe International Corp., a San Francisco-basedoil and gas concern, is a subsidiary of state-owned KuwaitPetroleum Corp. Santa Fe officials said operations werenormal yesterday.   Among other assets in Britain, the Kuwaiti office owns11.3% of travel and financial-services concern Hogg RobinsonPLC, 10.5% of Midland Bank PLC and 10% of hoteliers MountCharlotte Investments PLC. The office also owns St. MartinsProperty Corp., builders of London Bridge City -- a hugeriverfront office complex across the Thames from thecapital's financial district.   Elsewhere in Europe, the Kuwaitis own major stakes in someof West Germany's biggest companies. They own roughly 20% ofmetals concern Metallgesellschaft AG, and just under 20% ofchemicals giant Hoechst AG. They also have about 14% ofDaimler-Benz AG. These German investments have been generallypassive.   The Kuwait Investment Office has moved more aggressivelyin Spain, a hotbed of investment since its 1986 entry intothe European Community. In that year, the Kuwaitis took onailing paper concern Torras SA, since then building it intoone of Spain's largest industrial holding companies. TheKuwaitis own 72% of Torras, with the remaining 28% held bymanagement and Javier de la Rosa, the company's vicechairman.   Torras has direct and indirect interests in some 170companies in the chemical, food, paper and financial servicessectors. Its chemical concern, Ercros S.A., is Spain'slargest. Torras also owns 24.9% of property concern PrimaS.A.   The Kuwaitis also have extensive holdings in southeastAsia. Singapore's G.K. Goh Securities estimates the KuwaitInvestment Office's biggest investment in the Singapore andMalaysian stock markets is Malaysian plantation, property andmanufacturing conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd. Sime says theKuwaiti office's holding is 5.4%.   Among other assets, analysts say the Kuwaiti office alsoholds 49% of Singapore-based brokers J.M. Sassoon; 19% ofSingapore's Cycle andamp; Carriage Ltd., an automobile-industryconcern; and one-third of Singapore's OUB Centre, the city'stallest office block.   In Hong Kong, the Kuwaiti office owns about 37% of DaoHeng Holdings Ltd., holding company for Dao Heng Bank. DaoHeng Holdings is capitalized at US$312 million on Hong Kong'sstock exchange. Dao Heng Bank is among the six biggest of theterritory's 30 or so local banks. Kuwait also has about US$8billion invested in Japan, according to the Japan-KuwaitFriendship Society.   The Kuwaitis have kept a lower profile in North America.In Canada, the Kuwait Investment Office has a stake in thepartnership led by Gordon Investment Corp. that plans to buyColumbia Savings andamp; Loan's $3-billion junk-bond portfolio.   ---   Craig Forman in Prague and Carlta Vitzthum in Madridcontributed to this article.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE KUWAIT INVESTMENT OFFICE sold its 5.8% stake in KnogoCorp. in August 1989, according to Knogo officials. InFriday's edition, it was reported that the Kuwaiti officeowned the stake as of February 1989, according to reportsfiled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As apassive investor, the Kuwaiti office is only required to filenotification of the sale to the SEC annually.   (WSJ Aug. 6, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
