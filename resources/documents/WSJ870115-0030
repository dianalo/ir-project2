The maker of construction machinery and diesel engines said that despite the charge it still expects to report a profit for the year. It wouldn't comment on fourth-quarter results, which it expects to release next week. After Caterpillar's announcement, several analysts said they expect the company to post a fourth-quarter loss of $120 million to $150 million.    The closings, which aren't planned until sometime in 1988, could reduce Caterpillar's work force by as much as 2,900 people, or 5.4%. A company spokesman said Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., doesn't have exact figures on the reduction because the company may hire some people as it will be shifting production.    The spokesman said the planned closings are the result of a &quot;massive&quot; internal study that examined the company's manufacturing capacity. &quot;We had too much manufacturing space. Something had to be eliminated,&quot; the spokesman said. The closings are expected to increase the company's capacity utilization, the spokesman said.    Scheduled for closing are plants in Davenport, Iowa; Dallas, Ore.; and Glasgow, Scotland. The Glasgow and Davenport plants both produce the D6H track-type tractor; the Dallas plant makes lift trucks. Until its closing, the Davenport plant will also make Caterpillar's new agriculture tractor. Manufacture of these products will be shifted to other plants, the spokesman said.    The planned closings would appear to be partly in response to the company's admission last September that it was behind in its extensive cost-cutting efforts. At that time, Caterpillar said it was incurring &quot;significant&quot; modernization costs without all the expected benefits.    As previously reported, the company has embarked on a $1 billion, five-year modernization program. Caterpillar has said that because of the cost savings, the automation program should pay for itself over the five-year period. Also, in the 1984 fourth quarter, the company took a $212 million pre-tax charge for consolidating operations at five plants and halting construction of a parts warehouse facility.    Yesterday's move wasn't a response to weakening demand, the spokesman said. But Frank Manfredi, who publishes an industry newsletter, said he expects industrywide construction machinery demand to be about flat or drop 5% to 10% in 1987 from 1986. Also, the construction machinery industry has been plagued by severe price discounting.    Analysts praised Caterpillar's plans to close the three plants. &quot;You have to give the company credit for continuing to adjust its capacity and efficiency,&quot; said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.    Caterpillar shares rose 62.5 cents, to $43, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    In the fourth quarter of 1985, the company had net income of $87 million, or 88 cents a share, on sales of $1.81 billion. In all 1985, Caterpillar earned $198 million, or $2.02 a share, on sales of $6.73 billion.    The company says it doesn't plan further plant closings or consolidations. </TEXT></DOC>
