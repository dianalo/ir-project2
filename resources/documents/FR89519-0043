The delineation of suchrights is necessary in order to protect the contractor's rights to notdisclose proprietary data, and to insure that data developed with publicfunds is available to the public. The information collection burdens andrecordkeeping requirements included in this regulation fall into four categories.a. A provision which is to be included in solicitations where the proposerwould identify any proprietary data he would use during contract performancein order that the contracting officer might ascertain if such proprietarydata should be delivered.b. Contract provisions which, in unusual circumstances, would be includedin a contract and require a contractor to deliver proprietary data to theGovernment for use in evaluation of work results, or if software, to beused in a Government computer. These situations would arise only when thevery nature of the contractor's work is comprised of limited rights dataor restricted computer software, and given, that the Government would needto see that data in order to determine the extent of the work.c. A technical data certification for major systems, which requires thecontractor to certify that the data delivered under the contract are complete,accurate and comply with the requirements of the contract. As this provisionis for major systems only, and few civilian agencies have such major systems,only about 30 contracts will involve this certification.d. The Additional Data Requirements clause, which is to be included inall contracts for experimental, developmental, research or demonstrationwork (other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by auniversity or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or less).This clause requires that the contractor keep all data first produced inthe performance of the contract for a period of three years from the finalacceptance of all items delivered under the contract. Much of this datawill be in the form of the deliverables provided to the Government underthe contract (final report, drawings, specifications, etc.). Some data,however, will be in the form of computations, preliminary data, recordsof experiments, etc., and these will be the data that will be requiredto be kept over and above the deliverables. The purpose of such recordkeepingrequirements if to insure that the Government can fully evaluate the researchin order to ascertain future activities, and to insure that the researchwas completed and fully reported, as well as to give the public on opportunityto assess the research results and secure any additional information. Alldata covered by this clause is unlimited rights data, for which the Governmentpaid.e. Paragraph (d) of the Rights in Data-General clause outlines a procedurewhereby a contracting officer can challenge restrictive markings on datadelivered under civilian agency contracts, limited rights data or restrictedcomputer software is rarely if ever delivered to the Government. Therefore,there will rarely be any challenges. Thus, there is no burden on the public.Under the procedures established for development of the FAR, agency andpublic comments were solicited and each comment was addressed before finalizationof the text. The comments which were received were for the most part fromeducational institutions, which stated that requiring their investigatorsto keep records of unlimited rights data for three years after acceptanceof deliverables was unresonable, in that such investigators in realitydo not segregate their research by contract, but rather combine it withother data in order to continue their research. In light of this, the proposedrule was changed to state that the Additional Data Requirements clausewould not be placed in contracts for basic or applied research with educationalinstitutions_where the value was $500,000 or less. The $500,00 thresholdwas adopted after surveying the major civilian Randamp;D agencies, whosedata suggested that an average Randamp;D contract was $250,000_$300,000;in order to be commensurate with other clause thresholds, (e.g., smallbusiness subcontracting) the $500,000 was chosen. Thus, for most Randamp;Dcontracts with universities, no recordkeeping is required.b. <T3>Annual reporting burden: </T3>The annual reporting burden is estimatedas follows: Respondents, 1,100; responses per respondent, 1; total annualresponses, 1,100; hours per response, 2.7; and total response burden hours,2,970.<T3>Obtaining Copies of Proposals: </T3>Requester may obtain copies fromGeneral Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), Room 4041, Washington,DC 20405, telephone (202) 523-4755.
