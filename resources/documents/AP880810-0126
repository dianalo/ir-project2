A first contingent of five observers arrived in Tehran today,Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today saidPersian Gulf nations would be urged to donate a substantial portionof the peacekeeping effort's cost.   ``We'll be giving the same message to other countries like Japanand others who have an interest in the gulf,'' Fitzwater said.   Japan, which imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region,already has donated $20 million this year to U.N. peacekeepingefforts, earmarking half of the amount for the Iran-Iraq peaceeffort.   Those funds are being used as the seed money to begin thecease-fire monitoring effort, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani saidtoday.   The Security Council met today in informal consultations toapprove the secretary-general's list of the 24 nations sendingofficers to monitor the cease-fire.   The nations are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India,Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.   Next week, the General Assembly will reconvene in specialsession to approve funding for the Iran-Iraq cease-fire monitoringgroup, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. The special sessionbegins Tuesday and is expected to last two days.   The U.N., financially ailing mainly because America has beenwithholding a large part of its assessed contribution for severalyears, is due to run out of funds in October, ``or even earlier ifwe continue at this rate,'' Giuliani said.   The Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday to authorize the350-member U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, a day afterSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced a cease-fireeffective Aug. 20.   Direct peace talks between Iran and Iraq are scheduled to beginfive days later in Geneva.   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian mission to the United Nationsin Geneva, said in Tehran today that lasting peace will result onlyif Iraq is branded the aggressor in the war and Iran receivescompensation.   Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranian airspace inthe southwest. No bombing was reported, and the official Iraqi NewsAgency carried no reports of fighting.   More than 24 hours after receiving word of a truce in the8-year-old war, Iraqis continued to celebrate, honking horns andjumping out of cars to dance in Baghdad's traffic-clogged streets.   Iran, which had suffered a recent string of battlefield defeats,had a more subdued reaction. The nation's acting commander-in-chiefand parliament spearker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said soldiers shouldremain vigilant in the face of Iraqi ``mischief.''   In a statement read over Tehran Radio, he said Iran would notinitiate ``any kind of military and armed moves. But just likealways, (Iran) will be ready to give an appropriate response to themischiefs of the enemy.''   Marrick Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general in charge ofpeacekeeping operations, told The Associated Press all 350observers are expected at the 730-mile front in a week.   In a report to the 15-member Security Council, Perez de Cuellarestimated the force's cost at $74 million.   ``I simply do not have the money for this,'' he said. He lookedat one American reporter and added: ``You should advise yourgovernment to participate fully in these efforts for peace.''   The United States, which is assessed more than $200 million ayear _ a quarter of the annual U.N. budget _ is $467 million inarrears. The total of unpaid contributions to the U.N. budget bymember nations is $602 million.   The United States has said it was holding back funding to demandreform in the budget-making process, personnel cuts and changes inpractices that allow Soviet U.N. employees to remain under theirgovernment's control.   ``I think the United States will meet its obligations and makeits payments,'' said U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters.   ``This (U.N. peace effort) proves definitively that the UnitedNations has a purpose, that it is useful to all peace-lovingcountries, including the United States of America,'' he said. ``Ithas stopped the biggest war since World War II.''   Perez de Cuellar announced the cease-fire date after Iraq gaveup its demand for face-to-face talks with Iran as a precondition toa truce.   Iraq had demanded the talks as a test of Iran's sincerity inaccepting the cease-fire resolution July 18, a full year after theSecurity Council passed it.   Resolution 598 calls for a cease-fire; withdrawal tointernationally recognized borders; exchange of prisoners; peacetalks; and establishment of an impartial commission to judgeresponsibility for the conflict.   Iran repeatedly has said it wants Iraq branded the aggressor inthe war. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after borderskirmishes.</TEXT></DOC>
