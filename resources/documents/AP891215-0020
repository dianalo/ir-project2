Bush, with an assist from his 3-year-old granddaughter Marshall,threw a switch to light the National Christmas Tree on Thursdaynight, carrying on a tradition that Calvin Coolidge started in 1923.   He used the ceremony before about 12,000 people opening thePageant of Peace on the Ellipse both to celebrate ``the bells offreedom'' ringing across Europe and to nudge Americans once againto aid the less fortunate.   Bush even got into the shopping spirit earlier Thursday, makinga personal expedition to a local Sears store to buy presents _clothing, not toys _ for his 11 grandchildren. He came preparedwith a list and paid cash.   Unlike his predecessor Ronald Reagan, who used to light theNational Christmas Tree from the White House, Bush went to theEllipse to light the 35-foot living blue spruce, decorated thiswinter to symbolize Bush's ``thousand points of light.''   Describing the dramatic strides toward democracy that haveunfolded in Eastern Europe, Bush declared, ``This is the Christmasthat we've awaited for 50 years.''   Now, he said, ``1989 is ending bright with the prospect of a farbetter Christmas time than Europe has ever known; a far betterfuture the world dared to imagine.''   With the Berlin wall tumbling down and ``spring'' returned toPrague, he said, ``The glad sound you hear is not only the bells ofChristmas, but also the bells of freedom.''   Turning his thoughts toward home, Bush said:   ``We've worked hard this year, all of us, all of you, to helpbuild a better America, to help make this a kinder and gentlernation.''   But ``there remains a world of need all around us. In thisholiday season, reach out to someone right where you live,'' hesaid.   ``From now on in America, `there's no room at the inn,' that'ssimply not an acceptable answer,'' said the president.   The National Christmas Tree is a living blue spruce transplantedto its permanent spot on the Ellipse in 1978.   The ceremony, which kicked off the 1989 Pageant of Peace on theEllipse, took place despite some star-crossed microphones.   When singer Loretta Lynn tried to belt out ``A Good Old CountryChristmas,'' her cordless microphone flickered on and off. Astagehand gave her another mike. It was dead.   Lynn corralled master of ceremonies Willard Scott, dressed in aSanta Claus suit, and began singing into the mike beneath his beard.   ``I'm glad I had one beard to give for my country,'' quipped thejocular weatherman.   Later, singer Marilyn McCoo found herself without amplification,and pageant president Joseph H. Riley couldn't be heard introducingBush.   Some speakers cut off in mid-ceremony for the president.   Before retreating to the White House, Bush leaned over andintoned into Scott's beard _ site of the only reliable microphone _``Santa, you did a fine job.''</TEXT></DOC>
