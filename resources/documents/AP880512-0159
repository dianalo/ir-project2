WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, under Republicanattack for lacking foreign policy experience, exchanged warm wordswith Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa on Thursday andcriticized reported White House dealing to drop drug chargesagainst Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega.   Dukakis, before heading west to campaign for primaries in Oregonand California, also made the rounds among Democrats on CapitolHill, winning the endorsement of Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrdand praise from other leaders.   On Noriega, he said, ``I think before we start talking aboutdropping indictments and making deals, the American people deservea full explanation of what kind of relationship this administrationhas had with Noriega. ... Just exactly what has been going on forthe past 7{ years?   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drugrunners and murderers,'' he said at the Capitol.   Dukakis began his day by meeting with Tutu in private, focusingnews media coverage on foreign policy, an area that Vice PresidentGeorge Bush has portrayed as a Dukakis weakness.   A spokesman for the Massachusetts governor said Dukakis and Tutudiscussed House legislation that would toughen trade sanctionsagainst South Africa, including a requirement that U.S. companiesget rid of investments in South Africa. Dukakis later toldreporters he supports the legislation ``very strongly.''   Tutu told reporters he and Dukakis had no points of disagreement.   ``I don't think we need to give an endorsement, but we know wewould be amongst friends and we would have very, very powerfulfriends in the White House if we had a Democrat occupying the WhiteHouse,'' Tutu said. ``I know that our people back home would bevery delighted to have a change in the White House.''   Dukakis praised Tutu for showing courage and leadership, andsaid, ``It's time to change our policy and I assure you if all goeswell ... there will be a fundamental change in policy. This countryhas got to lead in human rights.''   Tutu said, ``God bless you.''   Dukakis, with a big lead in delegates, talked with congressionalDemocrats in meetings that were in keeping with his role as theparty's expected presidential nominee.   While he won warm words from those who appeared with him aftertheir meetings, the get-acquainted sessions underscored thatDukakis, as a three-term governor of Massachusetts, is something ofa stranger on Capitol Hill.   Besides Byrd, he won the endorsement of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,D-Ill., the House Ways and Means chairman, who called Dukakis ``thecandidate best able to lead our nation.''   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., who had backed RichardGephardt before he dropped out of the presidential race, praisedDukakis for signaling he values cooperation with Congress. ButFoley said he wasn't endorsing Dukakis over Jesse Jackson, citinghis role as parliamentarian of the Democratic National Conventionand saying he wished to remain neutral.   Byrd emerged from a private meeting with Dukakis and offered hisendorsement to the candidate who just two days earlier wonoverwhelmingly in the primary in Byrd's home state, West Virginia.   ``I do it without any reservations because I'm confident, basedon our conversation, we're going to have a president who will workwith the Congress,'' Byrd said.   ``I feel in the interest of party unity and with the progressGov. Dukakis has shown ... we need now to begin to close ranks, andthat's what we're doing today,'' Byrd said.</TEXT></DOC>
