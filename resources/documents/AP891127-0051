Gorbachev has endorsed a ``humane'' socialismthat he insists might even have to adopt traits of moderncapitalism to stay relevant.   ``In the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation withcapitalism, we clearly underestimate the importance of much thathas been done by humanity over the centuries,'' the Sovietpresident said in remarks published Sunday.   ``The new face of socialism is its human face, this fullycorresponds to the thought of Marx,'' Gorbachev said in theCommunist Party daily Pravda. ``Because its creation is the chiefgoal of restructuring, we can with full justification say we arebuilding humanitarian socialism.''   He said achievements attained under capitalism, like ``equalityof all before the law'' and general prosperity, should not bedismissed because of ideology.   Gorbachev also seemed to defend his reforms from charges theylack a clear blueprint, citing the precedent of Soviet founderVladimir Lenin.   ``There is a deep-seated belief that Lenin supposedly had acompleted program for the development of socialism in our country.But in fact he had no such completed program,'' he said.   In Czechoslovakia, the latest East bloc country in politicalupheaval, Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the 1968 ``PragueSpring'' reform movement that was crushed by Soviet tanks, readGorbachev's remarks as proof of the Kremlin leader's support forchange in East Europe.   For Communists, the wording ``socialism with a human face'' isinseparably linked with Dubcek and the Prague Spring.   Gorbachev has declared his support before for economic andsocial change in Eastern Europe, but by appropriating Dubcek'swords, he made his point dramatically.   Some in Prague took Gorbachev's comments as a public admissionthat the 1968 invasion, which led to Dubcek's overthrow, was amistake. The Soviet Union has not yet renounced the invasion as ithas the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.   As recently as last year, the Kremlin was vigorously defendingthe intervention in Czechoslovakia as necessary to block``anti-socialist forces.'' Soviets also avoided any comparisonsbetween what Dubcek tried to do and Gorbachev's reforms. ``Thedifference is 20 years,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.Gerasimov once said laconically.   Pravda said the 2{-page article was a synthesis of Gorbachev'srecent thoughts on the future of socialism and his own program for``perestroika,'' or reconstruction of the economy and society.   The Soviet leader's major theme seemed to be that socialism mustmodernize _ even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary _ or riskbecoming irrelevant. He offered no quick answers but said theprocess would take years, ``into the 21st century.''   He defended the 1917 revolution that brought the Communists topower in the former Russian Empire as a ``world-historicalbreakthrough to the future,'' but said socialism has often beenperverted since.   ``For the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism, humanindividuality was ignored, the development of the personality wasslowed,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
