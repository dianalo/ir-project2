The 27-count indictment was handed up against Ronald Semler and Monte Barry Semler, two brothers who partly own Associated Industries Inc., a North Hollywood, Calif., company dealing in military equipment. The indictment capped a two-year investigation of one of the largest alleged illegal diversions of U.S. aircraft ever attempted.    U.S. and South Korean defense officials earlier confirmed that 87 helicopters made by Hughes Helicopter Inc., which was acquired in 1984 by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and renamed McDonnell Douglas Helicopters Inc., are now in North Korean hands. Theodore Wu, deputy assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, said federal authorities prevented the Semlers' company from shipping 15 of the helicopters.    Mr. Wu said the unauthorized shipments occurred in 1983 and 1984. He said they pose a &quot;serious threat to the security of the U.S. and its staunch ally, South Korea.&quot;    The helicopters obtained by North Korea were civilian models of the military Hughes craft used by the South Korean forces. Many of the helicopters diverted to North Korea are believed to have been converted for military use. &quot;In an emergency the presence of those North Korean helicopters could cause havoc all along the 38th parallel,&quot; Mr. Wu said.    The indictment alleged that the two brothers worked through a representative of the North Korean Embassy in East Berlin, and that they created a West German company called Delta-Avia Fluggerate G.m.b.H. to handle the shipments. The Semlers were also charged with conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service, and with falsifying tax declarations.    Vincent Marella, an attorney for the Semlers, said Associated Industries cooperated with the government investigation. He said the Semlers are &quot;obviously disappointed that the government chose to file criminal charges against them.&quot; But he said the brothers are &quot;confident they will eventually be vindicated.&quot;    In Mesa, Ariz., a spokesman for the McDonnell Douglas unit said the company has &quot;established strict control procedures&quot; to ensure that spare parts and manuals don't end up in North Korea. The McDonnell Douglas unit, which claimed to have broken off its ties with Delta-Avia two years ago, wasn't charged with any violation. </TEXT></DOC>
