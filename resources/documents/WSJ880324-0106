While the drop wasn't severe, it signaled a slowdown from the stronger-than-expected annual sales pace of 7.5 million domestic cars in January and February, and a shift toward the consensus 1988 forecast of 6.8 million to 7.1 million domestic cars.    &quot;We were due for a correction,&quot; said L. Raymond Windecker, a market analyst at Ford Motor Co. He pinned the fall-off in domestic car sales at Ford, which took the biggest drop among the Big Three, to the company's late announcement that it would extend buyer incentives.    David Sinclair, new car sales manager at a St. Louis Ford dealership, said, &quot;Ford made a mistake&quot; by waiting to announce the renewal of its incentives until after they ended. As a result, Mr. Sinclair said, mid-March sales were &quot;a little bit soft.&quot;    Car sales in the March 11-20 period dropped to 189,245 from 217,939 in the year-earlier period, when there were nine selling days compared with eight in the just-ended period. The decrease works out to 2.3% when taking into account the shorter sales period.    The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, according to a U.S. Commerce Department formula, was 6.9 million cars, up from 6.7 million a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted sales rate may increase even while total sales decrease because of quirks in the formula.    Meanwhile, sales of light trucks in mid-March increased 7% to 111,380. Sales of all vehicles reported for the March 11-20 period -- including some imports and light trucks -- grew to 310,440, up 1.7% from a year ago.    Ford's domestic car sales fell 9.9% to 54,186 vehicles from 67,672 last year. Ford's light truck sales dropped 15.8%, which is somewhat surprising since minivans, pickups and other light trucks generally fare better than cars.    At Chrysler Corp., on the other hand, car sales rose 9.3% to 30,801 from 31,699 in the year-earlier period. The percentage decline is based on the daily selling rate, not total volume. Chrysler has been especially aggressive with buyer incentives, and has cut the base prices of some of its cars as well.    In addition, boosted by strong minivan and Jeep sales, the No. 3 auto maker's domestic truck sales surged 32.4% to 24,691 vehicles.    General Motors Corp. sold 92,173 domestic cars in mid-March, down 1.7%, its second consecutive 10-day period decline.    But heavy incentives pushed GM's imported car sales up 45.7% to 4,838 vehicles. GM's light truck sales totaled 45,376 vehicles, up 17.3%.    ---           RETAIL U.S. CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES-a                                   1988       1987      x-%                                Mar 11-20   Mar 11-20   Chg.
