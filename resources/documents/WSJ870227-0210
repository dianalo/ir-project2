People applying for firefighter and pharmacist jobs are more likely -- as a group -- to steal from their employers than are those seeking keypunch positions. Sales-clerk applicants score higher on honesty than do those who want a bank teller's job. Women are a little more honest than men; race and education don't make much difference, but age does.    Mr. Ash is vice president for research of Reid Psychological Systems, a Chicago company that developed written honesty tests in the early 1960s. With the polygraph, or &quot;lie detector,&quot; increasingly under seige as unreliable or invasive -- its use in screening job applicants is banned or restricted in 22 states -- more employers are turning to written tests to avoid hiring thieves. Today, Reid is one of three testing companies that dominate the field.    The tests typically pose 80 to 90 questions or statements with which the applicant is asked to agree or disagree. They give almost-instant assessments, and, at around $7 to $12 per applicant, are much cheaper than polygraph tests, which usually cost at least $40 apiece. The companies say employers, mostly retailers, gave about 2.5 million tests last year; they say they expect a 30% increase this year.    The tests aren't perfect. Testing companies defend their general validity but concede that they reject &quot;a small number&quot; of honest individuals who would make fine employees and that they let a few crooks slip by. But honesty tests have attracted little attention from civil libertarians, perhaps because a test booklet is much less intimidating than an electronic box with sensors and wires. Too, a polygraph examination is an interrogation; a written honesty test can seem like just more red tape in the job-application process.    That's the way some employers like to present the test. James Schmidt, loss-prevention director at Best Products Co., in Richmond, Va., tells job applicants the test is an &quot;attitude survey.&quot; Nobody gets a sales job at the catalog-showroom chain without passing the test, he says.    The tests strive to ferret out potential thieves with a combination of subtle and not-so-subtle questions. Some questions simply ask: How much have you stolen from past employers?    &quot;You ask, 'Who in their right mind would admit to stealing?'&quot; says Mr. Ash. &quot;The answer is: lots of people.&quot; From a thief's point of view, he explains, he isn't confessing but merely describing behavior that is normal from his frame of reference. Psychologists say that's because people who routinely steal usually associate with other thieves. They tell themselves they're just going along in a world full of dishonest behavior.    Thieves also often assume, wrongly, that they won't be believed if they don't admit to theft on a test. But they tend to understate their pilfering: If they stole $500, they may admit to what they perceive to be a more acceptable $50.    Admissions come more easily when an applicant can rationalize his attitude, says James Walls, a vice president of Stanton Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., another honesty-testing firm. One of Stanton's &quot;agree/disagree&quot; statements, for instance, is: Switching price tags is OK because most customers are cheated.    Miscreants who don't confess outright may trip on the tests' probing of attitudes about theft. Consider these statements: Stealing from an employer is different from stealing from friends. People usually steal without thinking about what they are doing. Dishonesty is OK as long as you are truthful.    Mr. Walls concedes that honest people may differ in their responses to those statements. Nonetheless, he says studies show that honest people usually disagree with them. An honest person might lose a point or two on the close calls, he says, but his true attitude will emerge over the course of the full test.    Outwitting the tests isn't easy. In one study, college students were given the test and told to try to appear honest. They scored lower than similarly educated people who took the tests as job applicants. Most people who try to &quot;fake good,&quot; as psychologists call it, are weeded out by questions designed to spot inconsistency.    But there's such a thing as being too consistent. The companies say that if an individual gives the &quot;right&quot; answer to every question, that's a good indication he's faking, since there's a little larceny in everyone. What the test taker doesn't know is how much is normal.    While such methods hardly seem arcane, the test-makers insist few people can circumvent the safeguards. In one study, prison inmates were given honesty tests and told that appearing honest would increase their chances of parole. All failed.    If people are getting wise to the tests, it hasn't shown up in test scores. In the early 1960s, 11% of those who took the Stanton test were rejected as &quot;high risk.&quot; Today, about 25% are rejected.    About 56% of those tested by Stanton score as &quot;low risk.&quot; The remaining 19% are classified as &quot;marginal risks,&quot; meaning they would steal only if presented with high opportunity and low risk.    Other findings: Attitude about theft doesn't change as people get older but they do steal less as they become &quot;less adventuresome.&quot; Past age 40, thieves &quot;burn out,&quot; says Mr. Walls.    People who use illicit drugs -- in any amount -- are more likely to steal. The tests don't probe deeply into drug use, but a surprising number of people volunteer that they use or have used drugs, says Mr. Walls. Again, all you have to do is ask.    The third major firm in the field, Chicago-based London House, also measures accident-proneness, tendencies toward violence, work values and industriousness. In general, testers say honest employees are better workers by most other measures. Their attendance is better and their turnover lower; they tend to have a &quot;ready, willing and able&quot; attitude.    Paul Sackett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has studied the tests, says the jury is still out on how well tests can cull the accident- and violence-prone. But he says studies leave no doubt that testing can help an employer screen out more dishonest people. The data is &quot;quite compelling.&quot; Still, he has some concerns.    The problem is that while the tests are statistically accurate, they may give false indications on any given individual. Even the testing companies concede this. So, the efficacy of the tests &quot;depends on whose perspective you take,&quot; says Mr. Sackett. &quot;Can it reduce theft? The answer is yes. Can we be confident about how individual people will behave? The answer is no.&quot;    Michael Tiner, director of government relations for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, worries that today's honesty tests will be tomorrow's tests on attitudes about unions and political persuasion. &quot;Essentially, all of these tests are psychological rubber-hose treatments by employers to intimidate people,&quot; he charges.    Mr. Walls says the tests aren't meant to intimidate. But since most of his retail clients have to accept many &quot;marginal-risk&quot; job applicants -- unresourceful types who steal only if they're certain they won't be caught -- he hopes the test does send a message. &quot;They're telling them, we don't tolerate dishonesty here,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
