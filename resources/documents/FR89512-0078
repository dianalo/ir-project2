The Act provides that in the sale and exchangeof Navajo Surplus, the Secretary of the Interior shall adopt the plan deemedmost acceptable, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Governorof Arizona, and Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD) (orits successor) for the purposes of optimizing the availability of NavajoSurplus and providing financial assistance in the timely construction andrepayment of construction costs of the authorized features of the CAP.The Act also provides that rates for Navajo Surplus shall not exceed levelsthat allow for an appropriate saving for the contractor.On December 1, 1987, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)adopted the Navajo Power Marketing Plan (Plan) on behalf of the Secretaryof the Interior. The Plan was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 21, 1987 (52 FR 48328). The Plan,a cooperative effort among Federal, State, and local entities, providesthe criteria to be used in the sale and exchange of Navajo Surplus afterthe date of initial operation of the New Waddell Dam. The New Waddell Damis the regulatory storage feature of the CAP on the Agua Fria River whichwill allow for operating flexibility to increase winter season pumpingand reduce summer season pumping, thereby providing an enhanced power resourceduring the peakload season of the Southwest.The date of initial operation of the New Waddell Dam, as defined in thePlan (section III (I)), is scheduled to occur on or before October 15,1992, as determined by Reclamation.By <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 17102) published May 13, 1988,Western requested applications for Navajo Surplus that will be availablefor sale and exchange after the date of initial operation of New WaddellDam through September 30, 2011. The applications for long-term Navajo Surpluswere to include the applicant profile data described in the notice andalso include the amount(s) of power and type(s) of service (sale or exchange)requested.The Western Area Power Administration (Western) has reviewed all of theapplications received pursuant to its May 13, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and has developed the proposed allocationscontained herein. Western believes that the proposed allocations best meetthe intent of the Plan. Western will not conduct formal public meetingsrelative to this proposed allocation but will consider all written commentsin making the final determination of Navajo Surplus allocations, whichwill be published in a future <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The comment period will begin with publication of thisnotice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and will end 30 days thereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Written comments may be sent to: Mr. Thomas A.

Box 200, Boulder City, NV 89005, (702) 477-3255.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 107 of the Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984 required the Secretaryof the Interior to adopt the plan deemed most acceptable for the purposesof optimizing the availability of Navajo Surplus and providing financialassistance in the timely construction and repayment of construction costsof the authorized features of the CAP. The Act provides that electricalcapacity and energy associated with the United States interest in Navajo,which is in excess of the pumping requirements of the CAP and certain needsfor desalting and protective pumping facilities, shall be marketed andexchanged by the Secretary of Energy in a manner consistent with the Planadopted by the Secretary of the Interior.Navajo Surplus, which is primarily a capacity resource, is being marketedin accordance with the Plan wherein capacity and energy will be availablefor sale and exchange on a long-term basis. Capacity and energy will beavailable for delivery throughout the year, onpeak and offpeak during thelong-term contract period. Capacity available for sale will be 400 megawatts(MW), less the capacity used for exchange purposes. A maximum of 150 MWof the 400 MW available may be used for exchanges on a long-term basis.There will be up to 760 kilowatthours (kWh) of energy per year for eachkilowatt (kW) of contract capacity available for sale or exchange, whichequates to a load factor of approximately 9 percent.The capacity rate will be fixed for the term of the contract at $72 perkW per year ($6 per kW per month). This equates to 94.7 mills per kWh basedon the associated energy of 760 kWh per kW. The energy rate will be basedon the annual operating costs associated with the United States Navajoentitlement plus a charge for Westen's costs associated with Navajo. Exchangeswill be made at a one-kWh-for-one-kWh exchange rate plus the above-notedcapacity rate and the charge for Western's costs associated with Navajo.Any capacity or energy not sold or exchanged in accordance with the foregoingmay, as determined by Western in cooperation with CAWCD and Reclamation,be sold under appropriate long-term or short-term arrangements or integratedwith the Federal system and sold by Western under arrangements developedin cooperation with CAWCD and Reclamation. The Plan further provides thatup to 30 MW of Navajo Surplus not sold or exchanged in accordance withthe above will be made available first to Reclamation for the purposesof the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act. The Plan provides thatdelivery of capacity and energy for sale or exchange is subject to theprovisions of section V of the Plan.The long-term contracts will become effective upon their execution. Deliveryof capacity and energy will begin after the date of initial operation ofthe New Waddell Dam. The long-term contracts will terminate on September30, 2011.Prior to termination of the initial long-term contracts, the long-termcontractors of the Navajo Surplus shall be given the first opportunityfor new long-term sales contracts and new long-term exchange contractsfor approximately the same amounts of power contained in the then existingcontracts with available capacity and energy distributed pro rata amongcontractors. Such new contracts shall be entered into prior to October1, 2007.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Allocation</ITAG>Navajo Surplus is being allocated for sale in accordance with the priorityrequirements of section VI of the Plan as set out below:1. Federal preference entities within Arizona,2. Federal preference entities within the Boulder City marketing area,3. Federal preference entities in adjacent Federal marketing areas, and4. Nonpreference entities in the Boulder City marketing area.In the event that a potential contractor fails to execute a contract withinthe period specified by Western and in accordance with the terms and conditionsoffered by Western, or if a contract is terminated in accordance with theterms of the contract, the allocation to that entity will be withdrawn.Any capacity and associated energy withdrawn or returned to Western maybe reallocated without further public process and reoffered by Westernin accordance with the order of priority specified above. In reallocatingthe power, Western will use the same methodology used in the initial allocations.The power being reallocated may be offered first to the remaining allotteesor contractors up to their initial requested amounts. The CAWCD has determinedthat all long-term contracts must be executed no later than August 14,1989, in order to accommodate CAWCD's contribution toward the cost of constructionof the New Waddell Dam. An extension of time will only be granted if suchextension will not affect the initiation of the CAWCD bonding, as determinedby CAWCD. Western is preparing prototype contracts for the long-term salesand exchange of Navajo Surplus. Such prototype contracts will be made availableto the proposed allottees and other interested parties upon request, whenWestern has determined that such prototype is developed sufficiently torelease for review.The Act also provides that Arizona entities, regardless of preference status,shall have first opportunity for electrical capacity and energy exchangerights as necessary to implement the Plan. Western, in consultation withCAWCD and Reclamation, may determine that any capacity and energy not contractedfor by Arizona entities for exchange may be offered for long-term salein the order of priority stated above or may be offered to non-Arizonaentities for exchange.Contract entitlements will be measured or calculated at the 500-kV busof the Navajo Generating Station. Capacity and energy, less losses, willbe scheduled and delivered at a voltage of 500 kilovolts to contractorsat either Westwing Switchyard, McCullough Switchyard, or at such otherpoints and voltages on the Navajo transmission systems as agreed upon byWestern and the contractor. Any necessary transmission service beyond theagreed-upon points of delivery will be the responsibility of the contractor.Western received 59 applications for sale and/or exchange of Navajo Surplusfrom entities located in the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, andUtah. Western received applications for purchase from 12 Arizona entities,2 Nevada entities, 9 California entities, and 35 Utah entities. Three applicationsfor exchange power were received from Arizona, one from Nevada, two fromCalifornia, and none from Utah. Western has analyzed all applications received,and each of the applicants were categorized in accordance with the prioritiesset forth in section VI of the Plan. Appendices A, B, and C provide a listingof all applicants, their priority category, and their requested amountsof capacity.Pursuant to the Act and the priority criteria of the Plan, the benefitsof Navajo Surplus go first to the entities in the State of Arizona. Sincethere are more than sufficient applications from first-priority entitieswithin the State of Arizona, Western has pro rated all available NavajoSurplus for sale and exchange to Arizona applicants in the amounts shownin tables 1 and 2. Because of this, the applicants described below werenot granted an alllocation.Although Chandler Heights Citrus Irrigation District (CHCID) is locatedin Arizona, CHCID was not granted an allocation. CHCID's application andapplicant profile data did not specify any requested amount of capacityallocation, so Western reviewed CHCID's load data for 1985, 1986, and 1987in an attempt to determine an appropriate amount to allocate. Western notedthat the maximum historic power usage for CHCID for 1985-87 never exceeded1.088 MW. Further, Western noted that CHCID has an allocation of Federalresources from the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLA/IP), plusa suballocation of the Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) Federal resource. Thesum of the BCP and the SLCA/IP Federal allocations is in excess of 1 MW.Western has determined that Navajo Surplus will not be allocated in unitsless than 1 MW. To grant CHCID a minimum allocation of 1 MW of Navajo Surpluspower would give CHCID a total Federal allocation of power greater thantheir 3-year historic peakload requirement. Therefore, in order to assurethem no entity receives an allocation greater than its load, no allocationis made to CHCID of Navajo Surplus.The following applicants qualify as second-priority applicants for saleof Navajo Surplus because they are Federal-preference entities within theBoulder City marketing area but not within the State of Arizona: EdwardsAir Force Base, California; March Air Force Base, California; City of Anaheim,California; city of Burbank, California; city of Glendale, California;city of Pasadena, California; and city of Riverside, California.The 36 Utah entities which filed jointly as the Intermountain ConsumerPower Association (ICPA) qualify for sale of Navajo Surplus as third-priorityapplicants because these entities' central headquarters and service areasare located outside of the State of Arizona in an adjacent Federal marketingarea (with the two exceptions of Dixie-Escalante Rural Electric Association,Inc., Utah (Dixie-Escalante) and Garkane Power Association, Inc., Utah(Garkane)).Dixie-Escalante's and Garkane's central headquarters are located outsidethe State of Arizona; however, Dixie-Escalante and Garkane serve loadswithin the State boundaries of Arizona. One of the expressed purposes ofthe Plan is to maximize the Navajo Surplus sales and exchange benefitsfor Arizona. Western is not assured that an allocation of Navajo Surplusto Dixie-Escalante and Garkane will be used exclusively for supplying theirloads located within Arizona. Therefore, the ultimate benefits of a NavajoSurplus allocation cannot be guaranteed to be directly beneficial to Arizona.Therefore, Western has determined that Dixie-Escalante and Garkane qualifyas preference entities located in an adjacent marketing area even thoughboth entities provide electric service to loads within the State of Arizona.However, because Dixie-Escalante and Garkane serve loads within Arizona,Western has determined that Dixie-Escalante and Garkane should receiveconsideration for an allocation before the other applicants in the third-priorityapplicant group if the third-priority group is considered for a reallocation.In addition to their application as a member of the ICPA, Page ElectricUtility, Page, Arizona (Page), applied on their own behalf. Page is consideredto be a first-priority applicant for the sale of Navajo Surplus and willreceive an allocation.The following entities are investor-owned utilities, do not own and operatetheir own electric utility system, or have not demonstrated electric utilityresponsibility. For these reasons, these entities qualify as priority-fourapplicants for sale of Navajo Surplus: Tucson Electric Power Company, Arizona;Nevada Power Company, Nevada; Southern California Edison Company, California;Las Vegas Valley Water District, Nevada; Kern County Water Agency, California;and San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District, Arizona.The following applicants did not qualify as first-priority applicants forthe exchange of Navajo Surplus because they are not located within theState of Arizona: Nevada Power Company, Nevada; Southern California EdisonCompany, California; and the city of Pasadena, California.Western proposes to allocate a total of 250 MW of Navajo Surplus for saleto the following entities that qualify as first-priority applicants forsale of Navajo Surplus:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s100,8.1 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Proposed Allocation for Sale of Navajo Surplus</T4><H1>Entity </H1><H1>Proposed allocation in MW</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arizona Power Pooling Association, Arizona<D>38.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona<D>2.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Luke Air Force Base, Arizona<D>2.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Department of the Army, Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona<D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Papago Tribal Utility Authority, Arizona<D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bureau of Indian Affairs, San Carlos Irrigation Project, Arizona<D>5.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Salt River Project, Arizona<D>200.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Page Electric Utility, Arizona<D>1.0</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total<D>250.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>Western, in developing the proposed allocations, determined that it wasimpractical to allocate the available 250 MW of Navajo Surplus for deliveryin units less than 1 MW; therefore, no allocation is proposed for lessthan 1 MW. The basis for this allocation reflects the direct relationshipof the individual applicant's load to the total load served by all applicants,with consideration given for the relationship of the individual applicant'sload being served by Federal resources. The load data used to develop theallocations were the individual applicant's average annual load for theyears 1985-1987, as provided in their applicant profile data.Based on the above rationale, Western utilized the following formula tomaximize the available Navajo Surplus to the qualified applicants:<ITAG tagnum="25">(Individual Applicant's 3-Year Average Annual Load ^ Individual Applicant'sAnnual Allocation of Federal Resources)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andCx.1; (Total All Applicant's 3-year Average Annual Load ^ Total AllApplicant's Annual Allocation of Federal Resources)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andmultiply; 250.0 MW (Rounded to the Nearest 1 MW)</ITAG>Western did not allocate more to an individual applicant than the amountthat was requested. The derivation of the allocation is shown in appendixD.Western proposes to allocate a total of 150 MW of Navajo Surplus for exchangeto the following entities qualified as first-priority applicants for exchangeof Navajo Surplus:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,8.1 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Proposed Allocation for Exchange of Navajo Surplus</T4><H1>Entity </H1><H1>Proposed allocation in MW</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arizona Public Service Company, Arizona<D>102.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arizona Power Pooling Association, Arizona<D>11.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tucson Electric Power Company, Arizona<D>37.0</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total<D>150.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>The basis for the allocation of Navajo Surplus for exchange was to proratethe total 150 MW of Navajo Surplus available for exchange on a percentagebasis of average annual load served by the individual qualified Arizonaapplicants, compared to the sum of the average annual load served by thosesame individual qualified Arizona applicants. The load data used to developthe allocations were the individual applicant's loads for the years 1985-1987,as provided in their applicant profile data. Based on the above rationale,the following formula was used by Western to allocate the exchange of NavajoSurplus:<ITAG tagnum="25">  (Individual Applicant 3-Year Average Annual Load</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andCx.1; Total of all Individual Applicant's 3-Year Average Annual Load</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andmultiply; 150 MW (Rounded to the Nearest MW)</ITAG>Western did not allocate more to an individual applicant than its requestedamount. The derivation of the allocation is shown in appendix E.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under the provisions of section 3 of Executive Order 12291, dated February19, 1981, a regulatory impact analysis must be made prior to the publicationof a major rule. This proposal is of a technical nature and consideredto be a nonmajor rule within the meaning of the Executive order. Westernhas an exemption from sections 3, 4, and 7 of Executive Order 12291; accordingly,no clearance of this procedure by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA),the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, and the Department ofEnergy guidelines for compliance with NEPA, republished and amended inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 15, 1987 (52 FR 47662), Western preparedan environmental assessment of the potential impacts of the marketing oflong-term Navajo Surplus. The Department of Energy has determined thatWestern's proposed actions as described in the environmental assessmentwill not lead to any significant environmental impacts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>), each agency, when required to publish a general noticeof proposed rule, shall prepare for public comment an initial regulatoryflexibility analysis to describe the impact of the proposed rule on smallentities. In this instance, this proposal relates to particular electricservices and rates provided by Western. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), such rulesand practices relating to services are not considered ``rules'' withinthe meaning of this Act.
