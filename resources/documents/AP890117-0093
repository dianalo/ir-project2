Three days before Bush will be sworn in as the 41st president,hotels were filling up with early arrivals from the 300,000 peopleexpected to watch or take part in the five-day extravaganza.   ``The mood is very upbeat,'' said Ed Cassidy, a spokesman for theinaugural committee. ``Rehearsals are taking place all over town.Decorations are going up. Thousands of media people from all overthe world are picking up their credentials'' to cover theinauguration.   On Capitol Hill, James A. Baker III, picked by Bush to be hissecretary of state, went before the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee to testify about his nomination. Demonstrating bipartisanpride in a native son, Texas Sens. Phil Gramm, a Republican, andDemocrat Lloyd Bentsen, sat alongside Baker at the witness table andurged that he be confirmed.   Baker testified that the first order of business for Congress andthe new administration is a ``meeting of our minds on how to proceedwith a changing Soviet Union.'' He said, ``Our task is to arrangeaffairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a moreresponsible, constructive Soviet policy will remain in Moscow'sinterest.''   Baker also said the United States cannot abandon the Contraresistance force opposing Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   Baker's confirmation hearing, expected to run two days, is thefirst for any member of Bush's Cabinet. The next round beginsThursday when the Senate Labor Committee meets on the nomination ofElizabeth Dole as labor secretary, and the Governmental OperationsCommittee hears testimony from Richard G. Darman, chosen as Bush'sbudget director.   Other hearings will follow in quick order. None of the Cabinetnominees is expected to encounter much difficulty winningconfirmation.   ``They are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, andwe won't have the rigid ideology of the first Reagan term,'' saidSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``I am trying veryhard to establish from our side an atmosphere of cooperation andbipartisanship.''   Bush had no public appearances on his schedule today but wasexpected to announce his choices for some top jobs in hisadministration. Among those expected to be named was Donald AtwoodJr., vice chairman of General Motors Corp., to be deputy secretaryof defense, the No. 2 post at the Pentagon.   Bush and speechwriter Peggy Noonan worked on his inaugural speechMonday but ``she had to go back to the drawing boards. They'retrying to shorten it, edit it,'' said Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.   ``He wants it short,'' Ms. Tate said, ``Something in the range of15 minutes or less.'' Bush worked more on the speech again today andplanned a dress reheasal on Thursday using a TelePrompTer.   Noonan, considered one of GOP's most talented speechwriters,wrote Bush's convention speech and also worked on the farewelltelevision address delivered by President Reagan last week.   The inaugural festivities officially open on Wednesday with aceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, featuring fireworks and 21 NavyF14 fighter planes flying wingtip to wingtip. Tiny flashlights willbe distributed to te first 40,000 people at the event, and they willbe asked to flick them on to underscore Bush's campaign theme of ``athousand points of light.''   A dress rehearsal of the opening pageant will be held today,complete with the flyover of jets.   Bush began his inauguration week Monday by paying tribute to theRev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a breakfast for black supporters.   ``We must not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his lifefor. I understand that five days before becoming president of theUnited States of America,'' Bush said. Federal offices were closedfor the national holiday commemorating King's birthday.   As Bush prepared to step into the limelight, President Reagan wasspending a low-key week. His only event on today's schedule was theacceptance of an award from the Touchdown Club, a sports boosterorganization.</TEXT></DOC>
