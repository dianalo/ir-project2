The radiationenergy absorbed by the film (X) can be approximated by the simple equation;X=EoSmut, where, S, mu and t are the surface area, the extinction coefficientand the thickness of film, respectively and Eo is the density of light-energyflow which can be obtained from the measured value of pyranometer (E)and the solar altitude. For diffuse radiation, energy absorbed by thefilm (X') can be presented by the equation; X'=(8/pi)(S/Sm)mutE, where,Sm is the measuring surface area of the pyranometer. Conecerning thesolar altitude, a new calculation process is derived to obtain solaraltitude at anytime where it is necessary to know only the altitude ofthe observing location.
