From a Japanese viewpoint,however, the attack on Pearl Harbor proved to be thebeginning of the end of Japanese militarism and imperialism.   Within two years of the surrender on Aug. 14, 1945, Japanhad a new democratic Constitution. Drafted by young lawyerson the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, that Constitutionstill governs our country. In it, Japan renounced the rightto wage war, the Emperor gave up his divinity and ademocratic parliament was established.   Devastated by a war that had left two million dead anddestroyed nearly half our urban area, Japan faced a longstruggle to recover. Japan has recovered, perhaps too well inthe eyes of some of our economic competitors. Still, in mypersonal life and business dealings, I've never encounteredany anti-Japanese attitudes in this country. But as weobserve the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, it's impossiblenot to detect a note of hostility toward Japan.   My hope is that some balance might be achieved by Americanrecognition of the importance of Aug. 14. I remember PearlHarbor with sorrow, but I view Aug. 14 as the beginning of anew world order, a world order that has seen democracy andthe free market economy vindicated by the collapse ofcommunism.                                                                                                          Motoo Kaji   Professor of Economics, University of the Air, Tokyo                                                                                                          In the first half of the past 40 years, hostile sentimentstoward the U.S. were strong on the Japanese side as seen, forinstance, in the protests against the Security Treaty in1960. In Japan, the usage of the term &quot;ally&quot; was avoided evenby the government. Since the 1970s and beyond, particularlysince Yasuhiro Nakasone's term as prime minister, the U.S.has come to be perceived as an ally. In recent years,however, it is regrettable to note that the perception ofJapan as an allied nation seems to be receding on theAmerican side.                                                                                                          Kenzo   Fashion designer, Paris                                                                                                          I have never encountered such hostility, be it personallyor in my work.                                                                                                          Saburo Okita   Foreign minister, 1979-80, and chairman, Institute forDomestic and International Policy Studies                                                                                                          I have been to the U.S. more than 150 times and have yetto encounter hostility over Pearl Harbor. But this does notmean that Pearl Harbor has been lost from the Americanconsciousness. While we must never forget Pearl Harbor, weshould not allow an obsession with a bitter yesterday toobscure our very real cooperation for a better tomorrow.                                                                                                          Toshihiro Tomabechi   Former president, Mitsubishi International Corp.                                                                                                          It is sad, indeed, that so many Americans still have suchsentiments 50 years after Pearl Harbor. Many Japanese feelashamed of their country's behavior before and during thewar. Many also feel sincere gratitude for the tremendous helpgiven to us by the U.S. after the war, without which Japancould not have recovered.   As for the U.S.-Japan trade frictions, I would not pretendthat the Japanese side is blameless. However, I cannot helpthinking that most problems are caused by domestic politicscombined with the selfish behavior of interested parties inboth countries.                                                                                                          Yusuke Kashiwagi   Chairman of the Board of Directors, Bank of Tokyo                                                                                                          I have not encountered intense hostility toward Japanpersonally or in my work. I do not think this is unusual.Responsible mass media, I believe, should not be misledmerely by a vocal small minority.                                                                                                          Wataru Hiraizumi   Member of the Diet and chairman, Kajima Institute ofInternational Peace                                                                                                          Fortunately, I have not personally encountered or felt any&quot;intense hostility&quot; toward Japan. At the same time, I am alsoaware that among important segments of American opinion therestill is an undercurrent of mistrust about the very nature ofour country. My view is that it would not be wholly accurateto relate that feeling entirely to the last war or to PearlHarbor.   The U.S. has played a major role in the transformation ofJapan from feudal society to modern advanced society. As thesymbol of the most salient values of modern West that Japanhas been determined to emulate, America has been one of ourmajor preoccupations for the past 150 years. Unfortunately,the more Americans felt that Japanese were trying hard toemulate them, the less genuine interest they seemed to havein understanding the Japanese. The human mind often works inthat way. The emergence of Japan as a major economic power inthe '80s, although long foreseeable, has therefore come tosome Americans as a shock.                                                                                                          Hosai Hyuga   Honorary Chairman, Sumitomo Metal Industries                                                                                                          Japan's postwar prosperity is owed mainly to her strongrelationship with the U.S. Japan was given access toAmerica's market for her manufactured products. Americatransferred high technology to Japan. Above all, Americaguaranteed Japan's security. Despite receiving such benefitsfrom America, Japan has not played a proper role as an ally-- which in fact seems to be the source of America'sfrustration with and hostility to Japan.   In order for Japan to build a genuine partnership withAmerica, we should open our market broader than any othernation in the world, because it was exactly this free-tradesystem that helped to boost our economy. Therefore we shouldpromote the liberalization of agricultural products andparticularly rice.                                                                                                          Tetsundo Iwakuni   Mayor, Izumo City                                                                                                          My first encounter with the ill feelings that still lingerafter World War II occurred in 1970 in Scotland's GlasgowStation. A man approached me, asking whether I was Japaneseand what I thought of the things that the Japanese Army didduring World War II. When I pointed out that atrocities hadbeen committed by the German Army as well, the man said,&quot;Yes, but that was different. They were Christians.&quot; Ithought, &quot;Are such things excusable for Christians only? Canwe never see eye-to-eye until all 120 million Japanese becomeChristians?&quot;   My second encounter occurred in the late 1980s, when Ioverheard a comment as I passed by a meeting room in the NewYork head office of a major financial organization. Anexecutive had been selected to become the new branch managerof the Tokyo office. In his thank-you address to hiscolleagues in the firm, he shouted, &quot;I am going to Japan toavenge Pearl Harbor]&quot; I was doubly shocked, both by hisremark and by the applause that it received.                                                                                                          Tetsuya Kataoka   Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University                                                                                                          I believe that U.S.-Japan problems stem in large measurefrom the fact that the two countries have developed in polaropposite directions -- America stressing its military mightand Japan its economic competitiveness. This has in turndictated excessive commingling and interdependence during theCold War.   The solution is for them to grow more like each other, andput some reasonable distance between them.                                                                                                          Atsushi Kuse   Vice President, Dentsu Burson-Marsteller                                                                                                          There's a link between the rise in economic pessimism anddislike of Japan. Both Japanese and Americans have torealize, first of all, that blaming each other iscounterproductive. Japan has to change the &quot;economy isalmighty&quot; mentality that dominates postwar politics.Americans, meanwhile, must realize that most of the economicproblems they face are their own fault, and can only be curedby their own actions.                                                                                                          Makoto Utsumi   Special Adviser to the Minister of Finance                                                                                                          I was a fourth-grade student when the Japanse Navyattacked Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor and the following PacificWar occurred at a time when the generations now directingJapan were unable to exert any influence or to make anychoice. In my view, the most important thing now is to focuson the future. It would be in no way constructive to stick tounhappy events in the past.                                                                                                          Akira Yeiri   President, Bridgestone Corp., Tokyo                                                                                                          To decry the Japanese of today for the actions taken byits leaders of yesterday is not only insulting, it'sdangerous. The Japanese of today gravely remember theatrocities of the war, both those inflicted by Japan andthose inflicted upon us. As the U.S. and Japanese economiesbecome increasingly intertwined we must all exercise greatcaution in making comments that may damage a relationshipupon which we both depend.   Occasionally I see statements suggesting that Japan'seconomic success is some sort of &quot;pay back&quot; for the outcomeof World War II. Comments like these trouble me, because Ipersonally know from Bridgestone's experience with theacquisition of Firestone Tire Co. that nothing could befurther from the truth. Our decision to acquire Firestone wasbased on one thing only -- to become one of the world'sleading tire and rubber companies. We have learned thingsfrom our Firestone colleagues, and we have also introducedthem to some of our techniques. We have shared our knowledge,our cultures, and we have built a new, better company.Perhaps the Bridgestone-Firestone relationship is a microcosmof the Japan-U.S. relationship.                                                                                                          Toshiaki Ogasawara   Publisher, The Japan Times                                                                                                          Recently, I was asked to make a speaking tour of the U.S.I was surprised by the warmth and friendliness of thegrass-roots Americans towards Japan. Indeed, I was surprisedthat I never came across anyone with a hostile attitudetoward Japan, although there were a few who were critical.Nevertheless, I can appreciate that those who personallysuffered or lost loved ones through the war might still bebitter. At that time, I was just 10 years old and our housewas burnt down in an air-raid.   On the other hand, one abiding impression that was leftfrom my tour was that many Americans hold hard feelingstowards the yearly ceremonies at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.These seem to be ill-understood by many Americans but theyare held with the intention of reminding us that suchmassacres should not be permitted to occur again.                                                                                                          Ariyoshi Okumura   President, IBJ Capital Management                                                                                                          Americans remember Pearl Harbor so as to never besurprised again. This has resulted in a strong defense for 50years and a world prospering largely in peace. Yet today, somany good friends of the U.S. lament the situation they seein America.   U.S. leadership suddenly started to descend in the 1980s.It would be descending still without institutionalizedsupport from the OECD countries, Germany and Japan inparticular. The U.S., however, is a lucky country, for theOECD group is unanimously willing to support her.   I have never encountered any hostility either personallyor in my work. I feel, however, a sense of estrangement thatcould grow further.                                                                                                          Minoru Nagaoka   President, Tokyo Stock Exchange                                                                                                          While I have met many Americans in my official andbusiness career, I have never encountered intense hostilityfrom Americans, implicitly or explicitly.                                                                                                          Ryoki Sugita   Managing Editor, Nihon Keizai Shimbun                                                                                                          Not hostility but hospitality -- that is what I haveencountered from Americans. However, I could well imaginesuch unpleasant cases as you suggest, so I would like topoint out the following: First, Americans had better makemore efforts to know Japan. Second, Japan should pay moreattention to international rules and customs and notemphasize our own uniquenesses too much.                                                                                                          Etsuya Washio   President, Federation of Steelworkers' Unions                                                                                                          Fortunately I have never personally encountered Americanhostility toward Japan. On the contrary I have been gratefulto America for the aid you gave us in my childhood after thewar. The American TV program &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; showed usAmerican democracy and the American way of life, and it movedme deeply. I think it is still a brilliant model for Japanesesociety.   The watchword &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor,&quot; like &quot;Remember theAlamo&quot; and &quot;Remember the Maine,&quot; made America awaken to thecrisis. You should make use of it now to re-build Americansociety and industries after the Cold War.                                                                                                          Leo Esaki   Nobel laureate and IBM Fellow                                                                                                          Perhaps because of the international nature of thescientific community, and the spirit of cooperation that isso important to it, I have not been exposed to a sense ofanger; in fact I can say that I have been warmly received andtreated with respect everywhere.   Regarding my views on Pearl Harbor, you may be interestedin some lines from an article I wrote recently for theYomiuri Shimbun: &quot;Fewer than one-third of all Japanese andAmericans have first-hand knowledge of the Pacific War. Thisgeneration will soon fade away, and with them both Japan'sinferiority complex toward the victors and America'ssuperiority complex toward the losers.&quot;                                                                                                          Rinjiro Sodei   Professor of Politics and History, Hosei University                                                                                                          American hostility caused by Pearl Harbor is complicatedby Hiroshima. In the fall of 1970, I was in New York Cityhelping to promote an exhibition of murals that depictedvictims of the atomic bombings.   One day a lady came in to see the exhibition andimmediately her anger erupted. She exclaimed something to theeffect that &quot;the Japanese have no right to exhibit this kindof pictures on Hiroshima. My brother was killed at PearlHarbor and the bombing of Hiroshima was a just response tothat sneak attack.&quot; It seems that even Hiroshima was notenough of a retaliation to put the memory of Pearl Harborbehind the American people.   Another incident that took place on the same occasionseems to verify this. I paid a courtesy call to adistinguished professor of Japanese politics and history.When I told him why I was in New York, he scolded me. &quot;It wasa war and in war death is inevitable. You forget aboutHiroshima, then I'll forget about Pearl Harbor.&quot;   To this I responded, &quot;I will not. I admit that PearlHarbor was a treacherous attack, and I apologize for that.But Hiroshima was the first shot of a nuclear war, quitepossibly the beginning of the end of human beings. So weshould not forget Hiroshima lest we be doomed.&quot;   What these two episodes show, I believe, is that Americanshold on to their anger regarding Pearl Harbor at least partlyin order to justify the atomic bombings. This is unfortunate.The Japanese government should have enough courage to lookback and apologize for Pearl Harbor. Americans should havethe calmness to understand the significance of Hiroshima.                                                                                                          Shinkichi Eto   President, Asia University, Tokyo                                                                                                          I am aware that strong feelings of hostility toward Japanexist among some Americans. From my observations, thishostility is not caused directly by memories of Pearl Harbor,but rather by economic disputes and cultural conflicts.   As a concrete step toward alleviating hostile feelings,disputes and conflicts, long-term efforts of exchange at thelocal level should be strongly pursued. It is educational andcultural exchanges, especially of youth, that will increasemutual understanding first between individuals and thenbetween countries.                                                                                                          Michio Wada   Special Adviser, Pacific Hawaiian Tours                                                                                                          The only uneasiness I have felt occurred when I visitedPearl Harbor itself. Some of the visitors from the mainlandglared at Japanese tourists but not a word was uttered.   I have a high regard for Americans who have such atremendous restraint toward Japanese, though they havesuffered personal loss themselves. I came to believeAmericans have a big heart not found anywhere else and alsothat time has erased some of the bitterness they have hadtoward Japanese.</TEXT></DOC>
