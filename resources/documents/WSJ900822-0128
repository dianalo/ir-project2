Farrell arrived at his officeone Monday morning three years ago, he noticed a single sheetof paper on his facsimile machine.   In three sentences of broken English, Elecompack Co.'sowner Han Ichiro Naito conveyed the alarming news: It hadgone out of business. Mr. Farrell's company, which counted onthe Japanese firm as the sole supplier of the storage systemsit sold, never heard from Mr. Naito again. &quot;We were dead,&quot;Mr. Farrell says.   Over the next nine months, Mr. Farrell and his associatesscrambled to save their company. They secured a temporaryalternative supplier and persuaded customers to accept thenew brand. Then they ventured into Japan's legal system,bought Elecompack's patents from a court receiver and movedmanufacturing to the U.S.   Mr. Farrell, 50 years old, wound up saving his company,Automated Storage andamp; Retrieval Systems of America Inc. But hisexperience is a warning to entrepreneurs who think joiningforces with Japan guarantees success. Growing numbers ofAmerican small businesses are indeed profiting handsomelyfrom their associations with prospering Japanese investorsand business partners. But when a Japanese concern runs intofinancial problems, the resulting mess can mean endlesstrouble for the U.S. partner.   &quot;There are countless business failures in Japan,especially among medium-sized and small companies,&quot; saysCarol Lyttle, a partner at Whitman andamp; Ransom, a law firm herethat represents foreign companies, including now-defunctElecompack.   If the Japanese firm folds, the risk is greater thatprincipals such as Mr. Naito won't be around to help theirAmerican partners deal with the fallout, Mr. Lyttle says. &quot;Adeclaration of bankruptcy in Japan is a far more seriousdisgrace than it is in this country, not only in the businesscommunity, but socially also,&quot; Mr. Lyttle says. &quot;You're morelikely to find that a person will become as inconspicuous aspossible for a long time.&quot;   Tamotsu Hatasawa, a partner at Miyake, Hatasawa andamp;Yamazaki, a Tokyo law firm that represented AutomatedStorage, adds, &quot;In general terms, if the president is aguarantor of its obligations when a Japanese company goesbankrupt, it is not unusual for him to disappear.&quot; Mr. Naitocouldn't be reached for comment.   Elecompack seemed sound enough when Mr. Farrell startedAutomated Storage. He already had been selling Elecompack'sspace-saving storage systems for two different U.S.distributors for more than a decade. When his employerdropped Elecompack in the early 1980s to make its own storagesystem, Mr. Farrell decided to pick up the product line anddistribute it independently. &quot;I was nobody,&quot; Mr. Farrellsays, &quot;but I'd spent too many years selling this, and it wastoo good a product.&quot; After months of talks, Mr. Naito namedMr. Farrell's new company his exclusive distributor in NorthAmerica.   In its first year, Automated Storage sold $1.3 million ofElecompack storage systems -- basically rows of shelving,with no aisles in between, that part at the push of a buttonwhen files are needed. As sales doubled annually for the nexttwo years, Mr. Farrell occasionally flew to Japan to solidifyrelations. When Mr. Naito came to New York, he and his wifewent sailing on Long Island Sound in Mr. Farrell's boat.&quot;Everything was going along beautifully,&quot; Mr. Farrell says.   By 1986, however, problems were developing at Elecompack.For one thing, to save money, some Elecompack distributorshad started buying directly from the company's subcontractorsand completing the assembly themselves. Consequently, eventhough his systems were selling well, Mr. Naito profited lessfrom them.   At the same time, Mr. Naito had begun spending on thedevelopment of a new fully automated storage system forwarehouses instead of offices. Mr. Naito pursued the projecteven after a potential financial partner declined to help himraise money.   Nonetheless, Mr. Farrell says, he had hardly expected Mr.Naito's alarming fax three years ago. He picked it up andread: &quot;Dear Gentlemen, please excuse this sudden notice.Unfortunately, Elecompack Co. Ltd. every activity {c}easedtoday on April 13, 1987. We are all so thankfull for longyears friendship of all of yours. Best regards. Finally, HankNaito.&quot;   Says Mr. Farrell: &quot;I was dumbfounded. I had struggled foryears, gone to Japan, created a dealer network. My life waspassing before me.&quot; Mr. Lyttle, who had known Mr. Naito for10 years, but also received nothing more than the sameone-page notice, adds, &quot;It completely surprised me.&quot;   With only one supplier, Mr. Farrell knew that his companywould have to scramble to stay in business. When Mr. Farrellfailed to locate Mr. Naito, his partner, Robert Gum, flew toTokyo. After confirming Elecompack's failure, Mr. Gumarranged for one of its competitors to serve as a temporarysupplier until a permanent one was found.   Next, Mr. Gum visited a Japanese freight forwarder thatwas holding about a half-dozen shipments until it collectedoverdue bills. &quot;They attempted to get me to pay for them,&quot;says Mr. Gum. He refused and threatened to abandon the goods.In the end, he says, he freed the machines at a priceslightly less than what Automated Storage normally paid.   Meanwhile, Mr. Farrell began approaching the 25 customerswho had ordered Elecompack machines that he couldn't deliver.Even though the equipment from the new supplier cost 10% to15% more than Elecompack's, Mr. Farrell agreed to sell it forthe same price and take a loss. Twenty customers accepted theoffer.   Lastly, Mr. Farrell set out to move manufacturing to theU.S. With the help of Mr. Hatasawa, the Tokyo lawyer, hedecided to buy Elecompack's patent from the court trustee.&quot;At the outset, I was not optimistic at all,&quot; Mr. Hatasawarecalls of Mr. Farrell's plan. &quot;It's very difficult tonegotiate with a receiver.&quot; But several months of bargaininglater, Automated Storage was able to purchase the patents forabout $18,000.   With the patents in hand, Mr. Farrell found a U.S.company, Patz Sales Inc., to make his storage systems toElecompack's specifications. Mr. Farrell spent the next eightmonths with Patz, a maker of agricultural machinery, helpingprepare its Wisconsin factory for the task. In the process,Mr. Farrell's company sank $250,000 into machine tools forthe venture.   By now, Automated Storage has recovered from the Japanesedisaster, Mr. Farrell says. The company is making a profitand should sell about $6 million of systems in the U.S.,Canada and the U.K. in its fiscal year ended June 30, 1991,he adds. Earlier this year, the company beat a dozencompetitors to supply Paramount Pictures Corp. with more than$1 million worth of storage systems to hold master copies ofthe studio's films, Mr. Farrell says.   &quot;We were talking about some fairly big numbers for acouple of guys who had just about gone out of business,&quot; hesays.</TEXT></DOC>
