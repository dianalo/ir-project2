Brown IIIStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HLYTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)FOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><TEXT>   In the fast-paced world of mergers and acquisitions, it seems that practically any company can be bought -- any company except Holly Sugar Corp.    The Colorado Springs, Colo., concern has been trying to go private since January 1982, when its then-chairman, Michael Buchsbaum, unveiled a plan to purchase Holly in a leveraged buy-out. But after five years and a string of maneuvers, Holly is still publicly held. And, as of last week, Mr. Buchsbaum is no longer chairman.    &quot;Leveraged buy-outs don't take five years,&quot; says Joseph Rice III, a partner with Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York-based buy-out specialist. &quot;Maybe five months, but never five years.&quot;    So what happened?    The saga of Holly has been &quot;one series of unforeseen dramatic events after another,&quot; says a Wall Street arbitrager who, in anticipation of a buy-out, has invested in and lost thousands of dollars -- on Holly. &quot;Something always seems to happen at the eleventh hour to screw things up.&quot;    The latest problem was a &quot;series of death threats&quot; that Mr. Buchsbaum says he received, threatening his life if he completed his proposed $134 million buy-out of the company. The bizarre announcement met with skepticism from certain members of Holly's board, which had already granted Mr. Buchsbaum's buy-out group, Arcanum I Partners, several extensions to complete the transaction since approving the proposal last month.    Then after an all-day board meeting last Thursday in New York, Mr. Buchsbaum was forced to step down as chairman, according to some directors, after he wasn't able to convince the board he had the necessary financing for the buy-out.    Mr. Buchsbaum, who remains a director, says he resigned out of &quot;concern for his family.&quot;    It wasn't the first time that a planned buy-out had collapsed. In 1982, two potential lenders, including General Electric Credit Corp. and Republic Bank of Dallas, backed off from Mr. Buchsbaum's buy-out plan. Persons familiar with the General Electric financing say the lenders dropped out because Mr. Buchsbaum prematurely announced that the financing was in place. The Republic Bank effort stalled because it required the company to come up with its own sizable contribution to the plan. After those sources of financing collapsed, Mr. Buchsbaum then said he was seeking funds from &quot;nontraditional&quot; foreign lending sources, but still no loan materialized.    Through his lawyer, Mr. Buchsbaum declined to be interviewed for this article. Holly and several directors who are company officers also declined to comment.    Dissident shareholders, including New York investor Jeffrey Picower and Houston investor Charles Hurwitz, have threatened to do their own buy-outs in the past. Holly fended off Mr. Picower in 1983 and Mr. Hurwitz in 1984, buying their stock at premiums to market prices.    The events of the past five years have left Wall Street professionals, investors and Holly directors perplexed that the company has managed to remain in play for so long, with its stock continuing to trade at a relatively high level.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Holly shares closed at $86.50, down $1.    Many on Wall Street wonder whether two former Holly suitors will step back into the picture now that Mr. Buchsbaum's bid has collapsed. Brookehill Equities Inc., a New York money management firm, and two affiliates hold 12.7% of Holly, and Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., a Burbank investment firm, owns 9%.    A spokesman for Shamrock, controlled by the Roy E. Disney family, said, &quot;The whole situation is so bizarre that we just don't know what we're going to do.&quot; He adds, &quot;We don't quite know what to believe or who to believe. We're kind of wondering who's in charge even.&quot;    Brookehill officials haven't returned phone calls since Holly announced the end of its agreement with Mr. Buchsbaum.    Mr. Buchsbaum, who gave up a 16-year career as a Wall Street trader to become Holly's chairman in 1981, has been praised by some analysts for streamlining Holly and turning it around. He upgraded refining equipment, closed down inefficient refineries and boosted cash flow.    But Mr. Buchsbaum has had his share of critics. Some believe he ran Holly as his own personal fief. &quot;I don't think he comprehended the difference between this being his company and a public company,&quot; says Stephen Elmore, a sugar beet grower and former Holly director.    Even Mr. Buchsbaum's supporters have said the company's earnings have been hurt by his preoccupation with taking the company private and fighting off competing bidders. &quot;We're not talking about pennies a share,&quot; says Donald Cassidy, an analyst with Denver-based Boettcher andamp; Co., a securities firm. &quot;We're talking about dollars.&quot;    Many buy-out specialists blame Holly's inability to go private largely on Mr. Buchsbaum. A sugar refiner's cash flow is uncertain and prices are propped up by government supports, making loans somewhat difficult to secure. But despite those risks, several other sugar companies, including Amalgamated Sugar Co. and Amstar have managed to go private in leveraged buy-outs in the past five years.    According to directors, at an Aug. 6 board meeting Mr. Buchsbaum was asked to prove that he had the equity to complete the transaction. That equity included $10.5 million of cash and the 94,600 shares, or 8.4%, of Holly common stock outstanding that Mr. Buchsbaum already owned. The board required that Mr. Buchsbaum deposit the shares and money in a bank account by 4 p.m. that day.    The deposit was never made, directors say. The board also learned that day that about $2 million of the Holly stock was used as collateral for margin loans for other trades Mr. Buchsbaum had done.    And, directors add, several times that day, when board members asked when the deposit would be made, Mr. Buchsbaum avoided answering by saying he had to place a or take a call from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the death threats. An FBI official in San Rafael, Calif., confirmed that he spoke with Mr. Buchsbaum that day, but says that the agency didn't place &quot;several calls&quot; to Mr. Buchsbaum.    So strange is the situation that one Holly director has proposed changing the company's name to Fantasy Sugar Co. He says that could entice Shamrock, because of its Disney connection, to buy the company. &quot;Just think of how much they could make on the movie rights,&quot; he adds. </TEXT></DOC>
