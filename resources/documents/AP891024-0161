The 45-year-old Gandhi, who pledged to uphold the constitutionafter paying a $30 election filing fee, was then driven throughSultanpur, a town of 100,000 in the northern state of UttarPradesh. He was greeted by about 2,000 spectators.   Political analysts say next month's parliamentary election couldbe the closest in India's 42 years of independence.   Gandhi, appearing in public for the first time since newelections were announced a week ago, professed confidence his partywould return to power in the balloting for the lower house ofparliament set for Nov. 22, 24 and 26.   ``The people are going to help us win the election,'' saidGandhi, who was filing in the Amethi constituency that he hasrepresented since 1981.   So far, there has been no indication of who the opposition willchose to oppose Gandhi in this constituency. There has beenspeculation the prime minister might face Vishwanath Pratap Singh,a former ally now leading the National Front opposition coalition.   ``I would welcome this,'' Gandhi told reporters, ``but he wouldlose.''   A month ago, a unified opposition seemed possible as Hinduactivists joined communists in anti-government protests.   But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violence around India haveled the communists and some centrists to question the viability ofa broad opposition alliance. At least 79 people have died inHindu-Moslem clashes since August, including 23 last month in UttarPradesh.   The prospects of Gandhi's party are uncertain. The primeminister has been haunted for more than two years by charges ofhigh level corruption in his government.   Singh, often perceived as wishy-washy in his efforts to uniteopposition parties, is campaigning as ``Mr. Clean,'' just as Gandhihimself did five years ago.   The 58-year-old Singh, who once served as defense and financeministers in Gandhi's Cabinet, has seized on Indian newspaperreports that Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid up to $50million in kickbacks to secure a 1986 contract to deliver $1.4billion worth of artillery guns to India.   Gandhi has repeatedly denied the reports.   Waiting for Gandhi on Tuesday, a score of men chanted that theywould vote for Congress Party.   However, Bahadur Singh, a university student, interrupted thechorus. ``We are free to cast our vote _ not necessarily for RajivGandhi,'' he said.   Other spectators said they would vote for the National Front.   ``We like V.P. Singh because he is an honest person,'' said20-year-old Girish Kumar, another spectator.   With more than 79 million eligible voters, Uttar Pradeshcontrols 85 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower policy-making houseof parliament, more than any of the other 24 states.   This year, under a constitutional amendment initiated by Gandhi,18- to 20-year-olds can vote in the national election for the firsttime. They comprise 7 percent of the electorate of 500 million.Indians will vote in 542 constituencies.</TEXT></DOC>
