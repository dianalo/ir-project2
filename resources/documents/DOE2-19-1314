We will discuss the possible typesof critical behaviour (depending on the dimension D of the embeddingspace) and the exact solutions obtained for D=0 and D=-2. The latterare important as a check of the Monte Carlo simulations applyed to studythe model in more physical dimensions. They give also some general insightof its critical properties.</TEXT></DOC>
