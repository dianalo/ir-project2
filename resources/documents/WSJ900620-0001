The final 355-59 roll call last night capped a day ofdefeats for the Republican leadership, which saw many of itsown rank and file repeatedly join Democrats to oppose effortsfor across-the-board spending cuts.</LP><TEXT>   More than 40 Republicans opposed a final bipartisan effortto impose a reduction of 2%, or $400 million, in the bill,and the debate underscored the immense difficulties that willface budget negotiators if and when they bring back adeficit-reduction package from their budget summit talks withthe Bush administration.   &quot;I am really depressed,&quot; said Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel,the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. &quot;Theythink the deals are being made in the summit and someone elsecan be a hero for them.&quot;   The support summoned for the bill reflects the strength ofthe energy and water coalition, which still can win supportamong traditionally conservative Southern and Westerndelegations even as it now champions more liberalenvironmental and scientific initiatives.   The measure funds an estimated 33 Army Corps of Engineersconstruction projects that weren't included in PresidentBush's budget, and the total of nearly $3.28 billion forcleaning up nuclear plants represents an increase of $488million from the administration's request and more than $1billion from fiscal 1990, which ends Sept. 30.   The opposition began at a disadvantage, but theRepublicans also appeared hurt by their failure to frameclearer choices. The GOP leadership has yet to offer analternative budget of its own this year, and in a bill ladenwith funding for parochial interests, the one Republicanamendment targeted at a specific account was offered by aMidwestern lawmaker, who conceded he knew little about theCalifornia power provision that a taxpayers' lobby had askedhim to oppose.   By contrast, the Democratic leadership appears determinedto use the appropriations process aggressively, both to putpressure on the summit talks and to spell out the party'sdomestic priorities going into the fall elections. Onback-to-back procedural votes, Democrats overrode Republicanobjections to taking up spending bills without a final budgetresolution, and by a 276-136 margin, the chamber approved aresolution making the House budget the guide for dividingdiscretionary spending between domestic and militaryaccounts.   Among major science accounts, the bill provides the full$318 million sought by the administration for thesuperconducting supercollider. While spending on magneticfusion would be frozen near current levels, high-energyphysics programs would grow almost 6% to $621.2 million.   Reflecting the pressure of Midwestern Republicans on theHouse Appropriations Committee, funding for biofuels energyprograms would rise to $36 million, more than double currentlevels and 28% above the administration request. Similarly insolar-energy accounts, where Mr. Bush asked for largeincreases, the bill bids up the president and reflects thepolitical ties of companies in photovoltaic research.   Despite its financial troubles, Lawrenceville, N.J.-basedChronar Corp. is a major force here, for example, with itsstrong financial ties to the Sheet Metal Workers pension fundas well as investors or projects in the home districts ofAppropriations Committee members from California and Alabama.</TEXT></DOC>
