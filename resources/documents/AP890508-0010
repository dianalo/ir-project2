WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just about everybody in the Democratic Partyseems pleased at the prospect that Jesse Jackson might run formayor of Washington in 1990 _ and not for president of the UnitedStates in 1992.   ``It's a great idea from a Democratic point of view, a strategicpoint of view, and for Jesse and the city,'' said Donna Brazile, apolitical consultant who has worked for Jackson and otherDemocratic presidential candidates.   After two groundbreaking presidential campaigns that alteredDemocratic politics, Jackson is tantalizing party leaders withhints he might forego a third campaign and run instead for mayor ofWashington. He has said he would consider the race only if hisfriend Marion Barry does not seek re-election.   ``It's a win-win-win situation, for everybody except MayorBarry,'' said Al From, executive director of the DemocraticLeadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats, many of themSoutherners.   The idea has won enthusiastic if tentative support from nearlyall parts of the Democratic Party, and carries appeal for bothJackson's backers as well as his detractors.   By taking himself out of the presidential race, Jackson wouldrelease his monopoly on black votes in the primaries, open up theparty to other potential contenders and, some believe, make iteasier for Democrats to unite in the fall and win back the WhiteHouse.   ``It would incredibly change the dynamics of the nominatingprocess in 1992,'' said From.   Jackson could provide a high-visibility replacement for thescandal-plagued administration of Barry _ who is viewed by some asbecoming a national embarrassment to the Democratic Party. Jacksoncould direct his motivational abilities to help stem thedrugs-and-death epidemic in the majority-black city, should he win.   Barry has been plagued by repeated embarrassments andsuggestions of personal impropriety. He is currently underinvestigation for visits to the hotel room of a friend laterindicted on cocaine-dealing charges, and has seen top appointeesconvicted of criminal wrongdoing in office.   Such a change would require a lowering of political sights forJackson. But some argue it would make sense for him, as he couldescape a likely third presidential defeat and gain a reliable localbase _ something he doesn't have in Chicago, where he has backedtwo losing mayoral candidates.   And in the process Jackson could pick up some governmentexperience which, if successful, could help him in a futurenational race.   In keeping with Jackson's style, however, his intentions remainunclear and are shrouded in carefully worded answers and crypticsignals.   Jackson told interviewers from the Washington Post and New YorkTimes that he has ``not yet made a determination to run'' when theWashington mayoral seat is up in 1990, and that he would not opposeBarry, an old friend from the civil rights movement.   If Barry stepped aside, however, Jackson said ``that's adifferent situation.'' And he said he has speeded up plannedremodeling of a vacant house he owns in Washington, and may movefrom Chicago when it is ready.   Jackson has until November, a year ahead of the mayoralelection, to shift his legal residence to the District if he is tobe a candidate.   Several political activists who are close to Jackson said thepreacher and civil rights leader is seriously considering themayoral race and has held lengthy discussions on the subject.   ``It has become a lot more real possibility in the last couplemonths,'' said Ann Lewis, an adviser in his 1988 campaign.   ``He clearly has been getting advice and to some extent isseeking it,'' said another adviser who wants him to make the raceand who spoke on condition of anonymity.   But it is the impact on the national political scene that makesthe D.C. mayoral race such a subject of intense interest.   ``You really haven't had any other candidates compete with JesseJackson for the black vote, so that would be a big change,'' saidOhio state Democratic chairman James Ruvolo.   Frank Greer, a consultant to Democratic candidates, saidJackson's exit would trigger ``a collective sigh of relief'' amongDemocrats, eliminating what many see as a polarizing influence.   By running for mayor, Jackson would not necessarily eliminatehimself from the presidential race two years later. But mostobservers assume he would, and there is debate over whether thatwould help liberal or more moderate or conservative candidates.   While creating an opening on the party's left, Jackson's exitmight also allow room for another candidate to put together abiracial coalition, such as Jimmy Carter did in 1976.   Mark Mellman, a pollster who worked for Tennessee Sen. AlbertGore Jr. in the 1988 primaries, argues that Gore was the secondchoice of many Southern black political leaders and could have wonsome of the Southern and other states won by Jackson without him inthe race.   ``I don't think it automatically pulls the debate to the left inan ideological way,'' Mellman said.   From said potential 1992 candidates such as Gore, Sen. Sam Nunnof Georgia, Sen. Chuck Robb of Virginia and Gov. Bill Clinton ofArkansas have demonstrated an ability to appeal to black voters andmight be given an opening by Jackson's exit.   And, From argues, all the Democratic candidates might have thechance to gain more attention and escape the ``seven dwarfs'' imagethat dogged the party in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
