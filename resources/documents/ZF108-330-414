 The goal--a market without national borders orbarriers to the movement of goods, services, capital, and people--was firstoutlined over 30 years ago by the 12 countries which became members of theCommon Market.andP;  In the mid 1980s, the effort was renewed when these samecountries approved an ambitious plan outlining hundreds of legislativedirectives and policies that would harmonize and re-regulate those of themember states.andP;  These measures are drafted by the European Commission, votedon by the Council of Ministers, amended if necessary, and then assignedbudgets by the Parliament.andP;  They include competition law, labor law, productregulation and standardization, taxation and subsidies, and quota and tariffguidelines.andP;  In 1987, the Single European Act created a timetable for thepassage of legislation with a formal deadline for the removal of barriers byDecember 31, 1992, hence the term Europe '92 (EC '92).andP;  But many havedescribed EC '92 as a process that will continue throughout the 1990s.andP;  Theouster of communist leaderships throughout Eastern Europe, however, hasraised unexpected questions about the participation of the Eastern countries,and this could alter or delay the process.andM;Nevertheless, the changes have begun and are taking place during theInformation Revolution.andP;  It is therefore natural to ask what impact EC '92will have on the computer industry.andP;  Inevitably, several of the directivesand policies relate primarily, and many secondarily, to informationtechnology.andP;  Table 2 lists the policies in effect and those being proposed.andO;In the following pages, Communications presents several points of viewregarding the impact of EC '92 on the information technology market inEurope.andM;As of July 1988, the European information systems market was estimated at $90billion by Datamation magazine and is expected by many to be the fastestgrowing market this decade.andP;  But during the last ten years, European-basedcomputer companies have had difficulty keeping pace with American andJapanese firms.andP;  In 1988, European companies managed only a 20 percent marketshare on their own turf, according to market researcher International DataCorporation.andP;  Not much had changed since 1982 when their market share was 21percent.andP;  As reported in the Wall Street Journal last January, Europeancomputer companies have been hindered by lack of economies of scale, narrowfocus on national markets, and difficulty in keeping pace with Japanese andU.S.andP;  product innovations.andP;  But the occasion for the Journal article was thenews that Germany's Siemens AG was merging with the ailing Nixdorf ComputerAG.andP;  The result would possibly be the largest computer company based inEurope, and the sixth or seventh largest in the world.andP;  And in October of1989, France's Groupe Bull announced the purchase of Zenith ElectronicsCorporation's personal computer unit.andP;  Bull claimed that it would become thesixth largest information service company in the world.andP;  Such restructuringshave been predicted with the approach of EC '92, as corporate strategieswould begin to take into account directives and trade rules regarding thecomputer and telecommunications industries.andP;  Smaller European and Americancomputer companies are anticipating battle with giants like IBM and DEC,which have long-established European divisions or subsidiaries.andP;  IBM has beenthe leader in mainframes, minicomputers, and personal computers, but it isexpected that all computer companies, European-based or not, will facegreater competition in Europe.andM;The Netherlands' NV Philips, the largest European semiconductor and consumerelectronics company, says it has been preparing for EC '92 since the 1970s.andO;And North American Philips Chairman Gerrit Jeelof has claimed company creditfor initiating the 1987 European Act.andP;  In a speech delivered at a BusinessWeek and Foreign Policy Association Seminar last May, Jeelof said that whileAmerican companies had forsaken consumer electronics, Philips and France'sThompson have held their own against the Japanese.andP;  But he indicated thatAmerican dominance of the European semiconductor market was a major impetusfor EC '92.andP;  Jeelof said:andM;...because of the lack of European strength in the field of computers, theintegrated circuits business in Europe is dominated by Americans.andP;  Europeconsumes about 34 percent of all ICs in the world and only 18 percent aremade in Europe by European companies.andP;  The rest are made by Americancompanies or are imported.andM;It is not a surprise then that in 1984 we at Philips took the initiative tostimulate a more unified European market.andP;  At the time, we called it Europe1990.andP;  Brussels thought that 1990 was a bit too early and made it 1992.andP;  Butit has been the electronics industry in Europe, together with other majorcompanies, that have been pushing for Europe 1992.andP;  Why did we want it?andP;  Wewanted a more homogeneous total market in Europe and, based on that, wewanted to become more competitive.andP;  The process is on its way and obviouslywe see some reactions.andP;  If you take action, you get reaction.andM;One reaction has been concern on the part of non-European companies and theirgovernments that the EC is creating a protectionist environment, a &quot;FortressEurope.&quot;andP;  As walls between nations are coming down, some fear that other moreimpenetrable ones are going up on the Continent's edges.andP;  Jeelof arguesagainst this perception in another speech, &quot;Europe 1992--Fraternity orFortress,&quot; reprinted in this issue in its entirety.andM;Communications also presents an analysis of several trade rules relating tosemi-conductors in &quot;The Semi-conductor Market in the European Community:Implications of Recent Rules and Regulations,&quot; by Roger Chiarodo and JudeeMussehl, both analysts in the Department of Commerce Office ofMicroelectronics and Instruments.andP;  The authors outline the consequences ofEurope's Rules of Origin, anti-dumping measures that are supposed to preventcompanies from using assembly operations in an importing country tocircumvent duty on imported products.andP;  In the United States, if thedifference between the value of parts or components from the dumping countryand the value of the final product is small, then duty will be placed onthose parts or components used in U.S.andP;  assembly operations.andP;  By contrast,the EC rule says that if the value of parts or components exceeds 60 percentof the value of all parts and materials, then duty will be placed on thoseparts and materials upon assembly in Europe.andP;  Since 1968, origin was alsodetermined according to &quot;the last substantial process or operation&quot; resultingin the manufacture of a new product.andP;  In the case of printed circuit boards,some countries interpreted this as assembly and testing, while others thoughtit meant diffusion.andP;  In 1982, the EC began harmonizing these interpretations,and as of 1989, the last substantial operation was considered diffusion: theselective introduction of chemical dopants on a semiconductor substrate.andP;  Asa result, American and Japanese semi-conductor manufacturers have spentmillions building foundries on European soil.andP;  To reveal the Japaneseinterpretation of such changes, Japanese Commerce Minister Eiichi Ono, withthe Japanese Embassy in Washington, DC, expresses his country's impressionsof EC '92 in this issue.andP;  In his speech, &quot;Japan's View of EC '92,&quot; deliveredat an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA)conference on Europe '92, Ono states that while the EC's intentions might notbe protectionist, they could become so upon implementation.andP;  His discussionfocuses on semi-conductors and technology transfer issues.andM;Although not a formal directive, in July 1988, the European Council decidedto promote an internal information services market (the last &quot;L&quot; document inTable 2).andP;  To present the reasoning and objectives behind this initiative, wereprint the Communication from the Commission to the Council of Ministers,&quot;The Establishment at Community Level of a Policy and a Plan of PriorityActions for the Development of an Information Services Market,&quot; and theresulting July 1988 &quot;Council Decision&quot; itself.andP;  Funds allocated for 1989 and1990 are approximately $36 million, $23 million of which was slated for apilot/demonstration program called IMPACT, for information Market PolicyActions.andP;  This may seem a pittance in comparison to the programs of othergovernments, but this Decision and other EC legislation are the first stepstoward an EC industrial policy.andP;  Recognizing that Europe's non-profitorganizations and the public sector play a very important role in providingdatabase services, in contrast to the U.S.andP;  wher the private sector is nowseeding the production of such database services, IMPACT has preparedguidelines to help the public sector cooperate with the private sector inmarketing information.andP;  These guidelines would also allow private informationproviders to use public data and add value to it to create commercialproducts.andP;  IMPACT is providing incentives to accelerate innovative servicesfor users by paying 25 percent of a project's cost.andP;  After the first call forproposals, 16 of 167 projects proposed by teams composed of 300 organizationswere funded.andP;  American-based companies can apply for funds if they areregistered in Europe.andP;  Unlike the U.S., the EC allows registration regardlessof who owns a company's capital.andP;  Projects funded are to develop databasesthat would be accessible to all members of the Community either on CD-ROM oreventually on a digital network, an ISDN for all Europe, as planned by thefifth recommendation listed in Table 2.andP;  One project in the works is alibrary of pharmaceutical patents on CD-ROM that will enable users to locatedigitized documents.andP;  Users will also have direct access to on-line hosts forall kinds of patents.andP;  A tourism information database and a multi-media imagebank of atlases are other pilot projects chosen, and another project willprovide information on standards.andP;  Eventually, audiotext might be used toretrieve data by telephone instead of a computer terminal.andP;  When the initialprojects have been completed, the Commission will inform the market placeabout the results of the implementation.andP;  Plans for a five-year follow-upprogram, IMPACT-2 are also under discussion.andM;These projects depend to some extent on the implementation and passage ofdirectives or the success of larger and better funded projects.andP;  On-lineaccess to databases depends on the recommendation for an ISDN as well as onthe standardization directive for information technology andtelecommunications.andP;  The certification, quality assurance, and conformityassessment issues involved in that directive are too numerous and importantto just touch on here and will be covered in a later issue of Communications.andO;To make these databases accessible not only technically, but alsolinguistically, the EC has funded two automatic language translation projectscalled Systran and Eurotra.andP;  Systran is also the name of the American companyin La Jolla, CA, known for its pioneering work in translation.andP;  Inconjunction with the EC, Systran Translation Systems, Inc., has completed atranslation system for 24 language pairs (English--French, French--English,for example, are two language pairs) for the translation of IMPACT-fundeddatabases.andP;  The system resides on an EC mainframe; there will be on-lineaccess by subscription; and it will also be available on IBM PS/2s modifiedto run VMS DOS.andP;  It is already on France's widespread Minitel videotextnetwork.andM;As this practical, market-oriented approach to technology implementation isbeginning, Europe's cooperative research effort, ESPRIT, is also starting totransfer its results.andP;  Last year, the second phase, ESPRIT II, set up aspecial office for technology transfer.andP;  Its mission is to ensure theexploitation, for the benefit of European industry, of the fruits of the $1.5billion ESPRIT I program that began in 1984, as well as the current $3.2billion program (funding through 1992).andP;  The EC contributes half of the totalcost, which is matched by consortia comprised of university and industryresearchers from more than one country.andP;  About 40 percent of ESPRIT II'sfunds will be devoted to computer related-technologies.andM;Every November, ESPRIT holds a week-long conference.andP;  Last year for the firsttime it devoted a day to technology transfer.andP;  Several successful technologytransfers have occurred either from one member of the program to another orout of the program to a member of industry that had not participated in theresearch.andP;  An electronic scanner that detects and eradicates faults on chips,for example, was developed by a consortium and the patents licensed by asmall company.andP;  This automatic design validation scanner was co-developed byCSELT, Italy, British Telecom, CNET, another telecom company in France, IMAG,France, and Trinity College, Dublin.andP;  The company that will bring it tomarket is ICT, Gmgh, a relatively small German company.andP;  It seems that inEurope, as in the United States, small companies and spin-offs like thosefound in the Silicon Valley here, are better at running quickly withinnovative ideas, says an EC administrator.andM;Another technology transfer success is the Supernode computer.andP;  This hardwareand software parallel processing project resulted in an unexpected productfrom transputer research.andP;  The Royal Signal Radar Establishment, Inmos,Telmat, and Thorn EMI, all of the UK, APTOR of France, and South HamptonUniversity and the University of Grenoble, all participated in the researchand now Inmos has put the product on the market.andM;Three companies and two universities participated in developing the DragonProject (for Distribution and Reusability of ADA Real-time Applicationsthrough Graceful On-line Operations).andP;  This was an effort to provideeffective support for software reuse in real-time for distributed anddynamically reconfigurable systems.andP;  The researchers say they have resolvedthe problems of distribution in real-time performance and are developing alibrary and classification scheme now.andP;  One of the companies, TXT, in Milan,will bring it to market.andM;Several other software projects are also ready for market.andP;  One is Meteor,which is aimed at integrating a formal approach to industrial softwaredevelopment, particularly in telecommunications.andP;  The participants havedefined several languages, called ASF, COLD, ERAE, PLUSS, and PSF forrequirements engineering and algebraic methods.andP;  Another project is QUICK,the design and experimentation of a knowledge-based system development toolkit for real-time process control applications.andP;  The tool kit consists of ageneral system architecture, a set of building modules, support tools forconstruction, and knowledge-based system analysis of design methodology.andP;  Thetool kit will also contain a rule-based component based on fuzzy logic.andO;During the next two years, more attention and funds will be indirectlydevoted to technology transfer, and the intention to transfer is also likelyto be one of the guides in evaluating project proposals.andM;Some industry experts maintain that high technology and the flow ofinformation made the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitable.andP;  Leonard R.andO;Sussman, author of Power, the Press, and the Technology of Freedom: TheComing Age of ISDN (Freedom House, 1990), predicted that technology andglobally linked networks would result in the breakdown of censorious andsuppressive political systems.andP;  He says the massive underground informationflow due to books, copiers, software, hardware, and fax machines, in Polandfor example, indicates that technology can mobilize society.andP;  Knowing thatcomputers are essential to an industrial society, he says, Gorbachev-faced adilemma as decentralized computers loosened the government's control over thepeople running them.andP;  Glasnost evolved out of that dilemma, says Sussman.andM;Last fall, a general draft trade and economic cooperation accord was signedby the European Commission and the Soviet Union.andP;  And both American andWestern European business interests are calling for the CoordinatingCommittee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to relax high technologyexport rules to the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union.andP;  The passage of thatproposal could allow huge computer and telecommunications markets to open up.andO;And perhaps the Revolutions of 1989 will reveal themselves to have beenrevolutions in communication and the flow of information due in part to hightechnology and the hunger for it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
