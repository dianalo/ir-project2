 In the current implementation of ISDN, thebasic channel available to all users has a bandwidth of 64K bits per second,although bandwidths available with fiber optics are considerably larger.andM;As copper wires in the telephone network are progressively replaced withfiber-optic cables, bandwidths available to each subscriber will dramaticallyincrease from 64K bps to 150M bps.andP;  To the network operator, the increasedcapacity of a network means that more traffic and greater diversity ofservices can be put into operation -- both of which will improve revenue.andM;Data CommunicationsandM;Another aspect of bandwidth and services relates to the increasing demand forcomputer data communications.andP;  Sending data over an analog telephone linerequires the use of a modem.andP;  With a digital circuit, all the user needs toconnect a computer to the telephone network is a standard telephone plug andthe appropriate communications hardware and software in the computer.andM;While data communications still accounts for only a fraction of the totalnetwork traffic (voice is, by far, the largest proportion), the demand fordata communications is rising rapidly.andP;  To fulfill this demand both now andin the future, networks must be available that facilitate rapid growth indata communications at the lowest possible cost.andP;  The best way to do this isthrough the use of digital switching and high-bandwidth transmissionnetworks.andM;The growing availability of high-bandwidth circuits is having a tremendousimpact on users.andP;  Corporations that previously used voice-grade analogcircuits for computer-to-computer communications were frequently restrictedto a communications speed of 1,200 to 9,600 bps.andP;  These links were oftenunreliable and prone to errors because of noise and distortion.andP;  As digitalcircuits became available, line speed immediately increased to 64K bps(equivalent to about 8,000 characters per second).andM;Thanks to technologies such as fiber optics, it is possible to transmitinformation at very high bit rates (currently in the region of billions ofbits per second).andP;  Bit rates of a trillion bits per second will be possiblein the near future.andP;  At present, most installations of fiber-optic systems incorporate networks operate at speeds between 100M and 565M bps.andM;While 64K bps is the transmission rate for a standard digital communicationcircuit, higher-bandwidth circuits are needed to handle traffic as it passesthrough the network.andP;  Using the techniques of Pulse Code Modulation andtime-division multiplexing, different multiples of 64K-bps channels arecombined to create higher-bandwidth circuits.andM;In North America, the various multiplexed 64K-bps circuits are known as Tcarriers.andP;  The most common is T-1.andP;  This carrier uses paired wires withdigital signal repeaters spaced every 6,000 feet and has a capacity of 1.544Mbps.andP;  Each T-1 carrier has the capacity to transmit 24 separate 64K-bpschannels.andM;Although the T carriers were originally designed to carry traffic within thepublic network, demand for high-bandwidth circuits from corporations resultedfirst in T-1 and then T-3 circuits being made available to them to lease aspart of their private networks.andP;  (In North America, T-3 circuits operate at44.736M bps.)andM;Both T-1 and T-3 circuits are used extensively in private networks,interlinking offices and factories across the country, carrying a variety ofvoice, data and video traffic.andM;T carriers form the backbone of a digital network.andP;  Initially, thevery-high-capacity, optical-fiber circuits with a transmission capacity ofbillions of bits per second are being used on long-distance routes to carrycalls between high traffic centers such as the large cities on the east andwest coasts of America.andM;As the cost of optical-fiber technology continues to fall, more of theexisting T carriers are being converted to fiber, thus boosting theirtransmission capacity.andM;One great advantage of high-capacity fiber-optic transmission systems is thatmany different channels can be accommodated within a single circuit, and thevarious channels supported by the circuit can be configured in a wide varietyof ways.andM;The circuit can be configured to carry only voice traffic with, in somecases, many thousands of 64K-bps voice channels operating over a singlefiber.andP;  Alternatively, the type of traffic could be mixed; that is, some64K-bps circuits for voice, 1.544M-bps circuits for data, other higher-speedchannels for video or television, and so on.andM;The design constraints of analog networks (which resulted in the developmentof separate networks for voice, data and telex traffic) do not apply todigital networks.andP;  A common information highway can be developed usinghigh-capacity, fiber-optic circuits to carry all types of traffic at speedsfrom a few bits per second to millions of bits per second.andM;The ''information highway'' is a single common network to which users haveaccess for all voice, data, text and video communications requirements.andO;Eventually, a single ISDN network will replace all existing networks, givingusers access to a universal information highway for all domestic andcorporate communications.andM;The concept of a common, single-transmission ''pipe'' is fundamental to ISDN,as this is the essence of an integrated digital network.andP;  As ISDN isconstructed at present, the information highway is limited to a transmissionspeed of 1.544M bps in North America and Japan, and 2.048M bps in Europe,thereby limiting the number of 64K-bps channels available to either 23 or 30.andM;The Next GenerationandM;The next generation of broadband ISDN will use fiber-optic transmissionsystems to link users with the network.andP;  These fiber-optic networks willprovide a huge increase in the amount of bandwidth available to users.andP;  Itwill be common for corporations to have access to circuits operating atspeeds from 50M to 500M bps.andP;  When circuits such as these are available, theconcept of a common digital information highway will be the building block offuture networks.andM;Future broadband ISDN networks operating at speeds in excess of 500M bps willbe constructed of multiple numbers of 64K-bps circuits, creating networksthat provide bandwidth ''on demand.''andM;For example, an ordinary telephone call requires a single 64K-bps circuit.andO;The transfer of a large file (containing, perhaps, a mixture of text,high-resolution graphics and video) requires a much higher bandwidth --perhaps as much as 50M bps.andP;  A common information highway can easilyaccommodate both requirements.andP;  Both high- and low-speed data can travel overthe same network, leaving it up to the user or the application itself todetermine how much bandwidth is required.andM;One of the most important aspects of ISDN as presently configured is that itsets a precedent for future network development.andP;  However, a major problem isits limited bandwidth.andP;  The significance of the current implementation isthat it has promoted the creation of a base set of standards upon whichfuture broadband networks will be developed.andM;Next week, we will look at the specific ISDN services and applications thatyou can expect to be using in the future.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
