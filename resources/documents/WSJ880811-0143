GEC Plessey said the agreement centers on a four-year phased transfer of the technology behind its integrated-services digital-exchange business-communications system to the new Shanghai Digital Telephone Equipment Co.    The technology-transfer accord is included as part of a 15-year agreement creating Shanghai Digital to make, sell and distribute the digital exchange in China.    GEC Plessey joined China International Trust andamp; Investment Corp., the Shanghai Telephone Equipment Factory and Singapore's Lityan Development as near-equal partners in the new company. The capitalization of the new company and other details of its finances weren't disclosed.    GEC Plessey was formed earlier this year from the telecommunications equipment-making units of Britain's General Electric Co. and Plessey Co. General Electric isn't related to the U.S. company of the same name.    Production is expected to reach 100,000 digital-exchange lines a year, with the first units assembled from kits shipped from Britain. </TEXT></DOC>
