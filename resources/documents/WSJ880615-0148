Your statements regarding the handling of exposure of new cancer treatments to the public are long overdue.    The manner in which the National Cancer Institute handled IL-2/LAK treatment publicity could have been better controlled. Local press conferences on IL-2/LAK were aired here in Washington, which I found to be disgusting. They resulted in giving false hope to cancer patients. It was all premature and now the treatment in the form announced so often is not even being used.    It is one thing having the press inquire about new findings obtained from a medical journal and another thing to have a scientist call a press conference. I see that manner of behavior as a publicity stunt for the program while the cancer patient ends up the victim who already is suffering enough.    I know what it is like to be a biomedical researcher as I have been supported by NIH research funds for many years. I also know what it is like to understand what happens in disease states as I teach basic science to medical students. However, I now speak as a cancer patient with metastatic malignant melanoma who believes that premature release of information on new treatments for terminal diseases must be better guarded.    It may become even more critical for the press to exert more discretion in what it publishes if increased publicity is sought by firms more interested in the stock exchange than in human beings. Officials speaking for any organizations that are cavalier in their attitude obviously have no idea what it feels like to have a body in which cancer cells are attempting to conquer their environment.
