Electronics. The letter was issued under the authority of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401-2420), as amended (the``Act''), and under the authority of the Export Administration Regulations(the ``Regulations''), promulgated pursuant to the Act.\1\<NOTE/> The letter charged that, on four occasions from December1986 through May 1987, Respondents exported, caused to be exported, orattempted to export microprocessors from the United States to Sweden withoutthe required U.S. export license, in violation of andSection;andSection;787.3(a)and 787.6 of the Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988).</ITAG>Respondents filed an answer denying the charges. Neither party requesteda hearing, and accordingly this case is decided on the record without ahearing. The record for decision June 7, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Agency's essential argument was that Respondent Cieslak has previouslybeen found guilty in a criminal proceeding of the unlawful export activityalleged in the charging letter, and hence in this administrative proceedingis now collaterally estopped from denying that he engaged in such activity.Thus the Agency showed that Respondent Cieslak, in October 1987 in a federaldistrict court in California, pleaded guilty to four counts of a criminalindictment that were essentially the same as the four instances of unalwfulexport activity alleged in the charging letter.What happened in these four instances emerges generally from the submissionsby both the Agency and Respondents. Apparently on or about each of thefirst three dates cited in the indictment and in the charging letter_December15, 1986, January 26, 1987, and February 2, 1987_Respondents ordered microprocessorswere shipped from the United States to Respondents in Sweden. These shipmentswere made without the U.S. licenses that were required for national securityreasons for the exports, and the charge for each shipment was making anunlawful export. According to the Agency's submissions, Respondents forseveral years made lawful exports of this type both by understating thevalue of the shipment in the invoices so as to avoid arousing suspicionand also by smuggling the goods out of the United States by hand.As to the fourth date cited in the indictment and in the charging letter,evidently on or about February 2, 1987 Respondent Cieslak was in the UnitedStates with microprocessors purchased from this same distributor, and hewas arrested while still in the country. Again the U.S. license requiredfor national security reasons for an export had not been obtained, andthe charge was attempting an unlawful export.For each of three counts in the criminal indictment based on the firstthree instances described above, Respondent Cieslak was sentenced to animprisonment of two years and three months, such terms to run concurrently;and on the fourth count he was given a five-year suspended sentence, andfive years' probation commencing upon his release from prison, on conditionthat he not reenter the United States without the written permission ofthe Probation Officer. For a sanction in this administrative proceeding,the Agency proposed a twenty-year denial of U.S. export privileges. Respondents argued that the criminal conviction should not be controllingin this administrative proceeding because Respondent Cieslak's guilty pleahad been based on the mistaken belief that he would be sentenced only totime served. Respondents also challenged the Agency's assertion that thesemicrocomputers are controlled for national security reasons, noting thatthe destination of the shipments was Sweden, a friendly country. Respondents further claimed that the Agency's case is defective for failureto identify the actual exporter of the microprocessors in the three instancesof an export, and for failure to make that exporter a party to this proceeding.Respondents argued additionally that imposition of any sanction in thisadministrative proceeding would be unconstitutional double jeopardy. Respondents contended also that the Agency should be barred from bringingthis administrative action because it knew of this possible action forover two years, but waited to serve Respondents until the day before RespondentCieslak's deportation from the United States. That situation, claimed Respondents,left Respondent Cieslak unable to defend himself, since he cannot automaticallyreenter this country for five years. Respondents claimed both laches andthe statute of limitations. Finally, Respondents asserted that a denial of U.S. export privileges wouldbe an undeservedly severe sanction because the criminal conviction wasnot for a willful violation, because Respondent Cieslak has been a reputablebusinessman in Sweden, and because he voluntarily opened his books to theU.S. Embassy there. Further on the magnitude of the sanction, Respondentsasserted that they had made some attempts to obtain U.S. export licenses,and that the U.S. supplier from whom they purchased the microcomputersreally should be the one held responsible for obtaining the licenses. Respondentsalso introduced evidence suggesting that microprocessors of this type aresold to Poland by a large American company and that they are sold on theopen market in Poland. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>As contended by the Agency, Respondents are collaterally estopped in thisproceeding from contesting their violations of the Act and Regulationsas established by the criminal conviction. This application of collateralestoppel is not avoided by Respondents' claim that the guilty plea in thatcriminal case was based on a mistken belief. If Respondents should succeedin obtaining a reversal of the criminal conviction, that reversal wouldjustify a reconsideration of this application of collateral estoppel; but,in the present state of the record of this proceeding, that convictionestablishes Respondents' commission of the alleged violations. See, e.g.,<T3>Spawr Optical Research, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Baldrige, </T3>649 F. Supp. 1366, 1369 (D.D.C. 1986). As to Respondents' challenge to the national security basis for controllingthe export of the microcomputers at issue here, Respondents have suppliedno evidence to support their challenge (see generally Section 770.1(b)of the Regulations). As for the absence from this case of the exporteror any identification of it, Respondents have not shown any attempt toobtain the identification through discovery or any convincing reason whytheir appearing alone in the case leaves them unable fairly to defend themselves.Respondents also argued double jeopardy, but supplied no reason why itshould apply to an administrative proceeding like this one. Respondents' argument based on the statute of limitations also fails. Theapplicable statute is five years (28 U.S.C. 2462), and the oldest violationcharged here is dated December 15, 1986. The Agency commenced this proceedingin January 1989, well within the five-year period, and the Agency's positionis that this commencement tolls the statute. Past rulings of this Departmenthave held that cases such as this one lack grounds for dismissal in thisTribunal based on the statute of limitations. See, e.g., <T3>In the Matter of Linotype Company, a Subsidiary of Allied Corporationand a Successor-in-Interest of Bunker Ramo-Eltra, </T3>ITA-AB-6-84, April10, 1987 Decision and Order 20. As for Respondents' argument of laches, they have failed to support itwith any showing of how the passage of time has disadvantaged them, otherthan a reference to Respondent Cieslak's needing permission to reenterthis country. But they have shown neither any effort to obtain that permission,nor how their defense has suffered from his remaining abroad. As to an approprite sanction, the twenty-year denial of U.S. export privilegesproposed by the Agency is severe. But Respondents' actions, which resultedin a multiple count criminal conviction, constituted a serious transgression.Respondents' arguments aimed at lessening the severity of any sanctioncarry only modest weight. That they expended some efforts to obtain U.S.export licenses is commendable, but still substantially short of the actualobtaining of the licenses that they law required. Their efforts indicatealso their awareness of the licensing requirements. Respondents' argument that their U.S. supplier should be held to some responsibilityfor obtaining the export licenses fails to undo the point that their criminalconviction establishes their having violated the Act and the Regulations.It is their violations thereby established_including the fact that theirtransgressions were serious enough to support a criminal conviction_thatsupplies the basis, in this administrative proceeding, for finding thatthey committed the charged violations and for determining the appropriatesanction.Respondents argued additionally, citing evidence they introduced, thatmicroprocessors of the type with which they were involved are being soldto Poland and on the open market in Poland. Even if Respondents' evidencewere accepted as establishing the sales postulated by Respondents_an issuethat is inconclusive in the record_it leaves unaddressed the basic pointthat such sales to Poland could lawfully be made only pursuant to U.S.validated licenses. It leaves unaddressed also such questions as whethersuch licenses would actually be issued and, if so, to what sort of endusers and for what sort of end uses, and subject to what conditions. Thewhole effectiveness of this export control is obviously undercut by effortssuch as Respondents to export without the required licenses.In sum as to the sanction, Respondents' violations were significant, andas such merit the significant twenty-year denial period proposed by theAgency. Accordingly, it shall be so ordered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>I.
