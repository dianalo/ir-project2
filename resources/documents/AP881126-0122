WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ship finally unloaded its toxic ash fromPhiladelphia after wandering the world's seas for more than twoyears in search of a place to dump its unwanted cargo, a portofficial said Saturday.   No one disclosed where the Pelicano, a 19-year-old freighter,left the poisonous waste. The environmental group Greenpeace earliercharged that it had been dropped somewhere in the Indian Ocean.   The ship remained anchored Saturday in international waters offSingapore, police here and in neighboring Malaysia said. It arrivedin the area earlier this week.   A spokesman for the Port of Singapore Authority said on conditionof anonymity that the vessel had unloaded its cargo but would not beallowed to enter port anyway. The Immigration Department says itwants to change crews.   Reporters who visited the ship Thursday confirmed that its fourholds looked empty.   While many ships are involved in carrying poisonous wastes, theepic voyage of the Pelicano has come to symbolize the problems oftoxic dumping, particularly in the Third World.   The ship, formerly called the Khian Sea, left Philadelphia onAug. 31, 1986, with 14,000 tons of the city's municipal andindustrial incinerator ash. It was renamed the Felicia last July andrecast as the Pelicano last week, according to published reports andshipping sources.   At least 11 countries on four continents have spurned the toxicwaste. The boat initially wandered the Caribbean for 18 months,reportedly leaving up to 4,500 tons of ash in Haiti before making anunsuccessful attempt to enter Delaware Bay. Its later travels tookit across the Atlantic to West Africa, the Mediterranean, and theIndian Ocean.   It is said to have been registered in Liberia, Bahama andHonduras at various times.   A report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said thecargo contained aluminum, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury,nickel, zinc and toxic dioxins contained in ash from a Philadelphiacity incinerator.   Greenpeace spokeswoman Uta Bellion has said her group learnedfrom shipping sources that the vessel dropped its remaining ash intothe Indian Ocean. She gave no details.   A man who identified himself as Capt. Arturo Fuentes denied thatthe ash, which he said was non-toxic, was dumped at sea. He toldreporters who visited the ship Thursday that the Pelican unloaded itin port but refused to say in what country.   ``I do not know what they did with the ash,'' said Fuentes.   Greenpeace estimates that at least 11 developing countries haveaccepted waste from the United States and Europe since 1986. The EPAsays about 2.2 million tons of toxic garbage cross internationalborders each year.</TEXT></DOC>
