Col. William Higgins by pro-Iranian kidnappers,Monday night called on ``all parties'' holding hostages in theMiddle East to release them ``to begin to reverse the cycle ofviolence.''   In a statement telephoned to news organizations, Bush pointedlyrenewed his criticism of Israel, whose kidnapping on Friday of aMoslem Shiite cleric led Higgins' kidnappers to release a tapewhich they said showed his execution by hanging.   ``On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was nothelpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragicevents of today have underscored the validity of that statement,''Bush said.   ``Tonight I wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent callto all, all parties, who hold hostages in the Middle East torelease them forthwith, as an humanitarian gesture, to begin toreverse the cycle of violence in that region.''   In his conference call to news agencies, presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said it was ``impossible to tell'' what thereaction to the president's statement would be.   Asked if the U.S. government had contacted Israeli in an attemptto persuade it to release its hostage, Fitzwater replied that ``Wehave had contacts with Israel, but not in the past day.'' He didnot elaborate on the nature of the contacts.   ``We face a very difficult situation,'' Fitzwater said. ``Wehave threats of two other possible deaths. We have hostages beingheld by a number of countries or factions or groups.   ``The president feels his plea, with real attention focused onthe situation, could give everyone a chance to release theirhostages.''   Fitzwater referred to threats made during the day by groups inthe Middle East against two hostages, Joseph James Cicippio, anofficial of the American University of Beirut, and Anglican churchenvoy Terry Waite.   Earlier, referring to ``this brutal murder'' of the Marineofficer, Bush said: ``It is a most troubling and disturbing matterthat has shocked the American people right to the core. There is noway that I can properly express the outrage that I feel.''   While Bush cautioned publicly that he had no confirmationHiggins had in fact been hanged, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan., said the president told congressional leaders Monday nightthat ``it's about a 98 percent probability that it happened.''   In the first reaction to Bush's call, Ehud Olmert, ministerwithout portfolio in the Israeli government, said on the ABC``Nightline'' program he did not believe the president wantedIsrael to give up its hostage without a ``good chance'' ofobtaining the release of others thereby.   ``I just don't believe that the president wanted to just draw acomparison between Israel and these organizations _ to say, `Youdid something wrong,' and `You did something wrong' and justrelease all the hostages.   ``I think the logic of what the president said is that Hezbollahshould release all the hostages, the American and Israeli hostages,and in that case it is also wise to release (Sheik Abdul Karim)Obeid,'' the Hezbollah leader kidnapped by Israeli commandos,Olmert said.   He defended the decision to kidnap Obeid on the grounds that``We have tried all other ways. There came a time when we had todecide whether we do something or just sit still'' againstterrorism.   Bush monitored reports through the afternoon after returningfrom Chicago, then met into the evening in the Cabinet room withtop advisers, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, DeputySecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and other Cabinet members,before briefing the congressional leaders.   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,said after that meeting that Bush was considering several optionsbut he declined to identify them.   ``I don't think anything has been ruled out at this point,''Boren said.   During his earlier meeting with advisers, Bush ``received abriefing on the status of our knowledge of the situation. This wasprimarily an informational meeting at which all aspects of the caseinvolving Col. Higgins and the other hostages were discussed,''Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.   Higgins' reported killing triggered an instant debate inCongress over Israel's role in the events. Israeli commandoskidnapped a Shiite Moslem cleric last week, and the announcement ofHiggins' hanging said he was killed in retaliation.   ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on behalf of the Israeliswould be refreshing,'' Dole said. But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,countered that blaming Israel would be ``turning the world on itshead.''   At the White House, officials carefully avoided direct criticismof Israel, but Fitzwater said, ``It is fair to say that many peopledo share the senator's concerns.'' He would not elaborate.   An Israeli official in Washington, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said, ``It's ridiculous to say that Israel isresponsible for Higgins' death. We don't even know if it's him, andif it is, when he was killed.''   A member of Congress who attended the leadership meeting withBush, speaking on condition of no further identification, said thelawmakers were told repeatedly the United States was given nonotice of Israeli's intent to kidnap the cleric, and ``There was noconsultation between Israel and the United States.''   After meeting with Bush, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, said the president ``strongly reaffirmed his belief in theappropriate policy of not negotiating with terorrists in anycircumstances.''   He, like others at the meeting, declined to discuss whichpossible responses _ including military options _ might be underconsideration.   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said after the White House meeting: ``Thepresident made it very clear, until the facts are known, at leastmore facts than we have now, there's no way you can make adefinitive decision'' on what to do.   There are nine Americans in captivity in the Middle East,including Terry Anderson, Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press.   ``Somehow there has got to be a return to decency and honor,even in matters of this nature,'' Bush said on the White House lawnafter returning from Chicago, where he had addressed the NationalGovernors' Association.   He also said he had spoken by telephone with Higgins' wife, ``awonderfully stoic individual who is going through sheer hell.''   Bush cancelled appearances in Las Vegas and Oklahoma City.   He learned of reports of the execution as he landed in Chicago.   Higgins, 44, was serving as part of an internationalpeacekeeping force in Lebanon when he was taken captive in February1988. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said they hanged him Mondayin retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric. Thegroup released a videotape purporting to show the execution.   Israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric, SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, and other Shiite Moslem captives for allcaptured Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by Shiitegroups in Lebanon.   Secretary of State James A. Baker, leaving Paris for Washingtonafter a weekend of meetings focusing on U.S.-Soviet relations andthe future of Cambodia., called the execution report ``outrageousand uncivilized.''   Dole said in Washington, ``I would hope the Israelis would takeanother look at some of their actions that they must know inadvance would endanger American lives.''   But Rep. Schumer said, ``Israel is among the few countriesseeking to fight terrorism. The blame has to fall on the terroriststhemselves.''   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., was circulating a letter askingcolleagues to support a resolution calling for the extradition ofSheik Obeid to stand trial in the United States for the kidnappingof Higgins.</TEXT></DOC>
