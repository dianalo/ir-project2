(c) Its provisions are not mandatory for CAs staffed solely with DoD civilianpersonnel paid by nonappropriated funds, such as military exchanges. However,this part is mandatory for CAs when they are staffed partially with DoDcivilian personnel paid by or reimbursed from appropriated funds, suchas libraries, open messes, and other morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR)activities. When related installation support functions are being cost-comparedunder a single solicitation, a DoD Component may decide that it is practicalto include activities staffed solely with DoD civilian personnel paid bynonappropriated funds. (d) Does not apply to DoD governmental functions as defined in andSection;169a.3.(e) Does not apply when contrary to law, Executive orders, or any treatyor international agreement. (f) Does not apply in times of a declared war or military mobilization.(g) Does not provide authority to enter into contracts. (h) Does not apply to the conduct of research and development, except forseverable in-house CAs that support research and development, such as thoselisted in Appendix A. (i) Does not justify conversion to contract solely to avoid personnel ceilingsor salary limitations. (j) Does not authorize contracts that establish an employer-employee relationshipbetween the Department of Defense and contractor employees, as describedin FAR 37.104. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 169a.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Definitions.</ITAG><T3>Commercial activity review. </T3>The process of evaluating CAs fordetermining whether or not a cost comparison shall be conducted.<T3>Commercial source. </T3>A business and/or other non-Federal activitylocated in the United States, its territories and possessions, the Districtof Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that provides a commercialproduct or service. <T3>Conversion to contract. </T3>The changeover of a CA from performanceof DoD personnel to performance under contract by a commercial source.<T3>Conversion to in-house. </T3>The changeover of a CA from performanceunder contract by a commercial source to performance by DoD personnel.<T3>Core logistics. </T3>Those functions identified as Core logistics activitiespursuant to section 307 of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 1231 of Pub. L. 99-145,codified at section 2464, Title 10 that are necessary to maintain a logisticscapability (including personnel, equipment, and facilities) to ensure aready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessaryto ensure effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defensecontingency situation, and other emergency requirements.<T3>Cost comparison. </T3>The process of developing an estimate of thecost of performance of a CA by DoD employees and comparing it to the costof performance by contract. <T3>Direct conversion.</T3> Conversions to contract performance of an in-housecommercial activity involving 45 or fewer DoD civilian employees or theconversion of an in-house commercial activity performed exclusively bymilitary personnel or the conversion of 10 or fewer DoD civilian employeeswithout a cost comparison. <T3>Directly affected parties. </T3>DoD employees and their representativeorganizations and offerors to the solicitation. <T3>Displaced DoD employee. </T3>Any DoD employee affected by conversionto contract operation (including such actions as job elimination or gradereduction). It includes both employees in the function converted to contractand to employees outside the function who are affected adversely by conversionthrough reassignment or the exercise of bumping or retreat rights. <T3>DoD commercial activity (CA). </T3>An activity that provides a productor service obtainable (or obtained) from a commercial source. A DoD CAmay be the mission of an organization or a function within the organization.It must be a type of work that is separable from other functions or activitiesso that it is suitable for performance by contract. A representative listof the functions performed by such activities is provided in Appendix A.A DoD CA falls into one of two categories: (a)<T3> Contract CA. </T3>A DoD CA managed by a DoD Component, but operatedwith contractor personnel. (b)<T3> In-house CA. </T3>A DoD CA operated by a DoD Component with DoD personnel.<T3>DoD employee. </T3>Civilian personnel, both permanent and temporary,of the Department of Defense. <T3>DoD governmental function.</T3> A function that is related so intimatelyto the public interest as to mandate performance by DoD personnel. Thesefunctions include those that require either the exercise of discretionin applying Government authority or the use of value judgment in makingdecisions for the Department of Defense. Services or products in supportof governmental functions, such as those listed in Appendix A, are CAsand are subject to 32 CFR Part 169 and this implementing part. Governmentalfunctions normally fall into two categories: (a) <T3>Act of governing.</T3> The discretionary exercise of government authority.Examples include criminal investigations, prosecutions, and other judicialfunctions; management of Government programs requiring value judgments,as in direction of the national defense; management and direction of theArmed Services; activities performed exclusively by military personnelwho are subject to deployment in a combat, combat support, or combat servicesupport role; conduct of foreign relations; selection of program priorities;direction of Federal employees; regulation of the use of space, oceans,navigable rivers, and other natural resources; management of natural resourceson Federal property; direction of intelligence and counterintelligenceoperations; and regulation of industry and commerce, including food anddrugs. (b) <T3>Monetary transactions and entitlements. </T3>Refers to such actionsas tax collection and revenue disbursements, control of treasury accountsand the money supply, and the administration of public trusts. <T3>DoD personnel. </T3>Military and civilian personnel of the Departmentof Defense. <T3>Expansion.</T3> The modernization, replacement, upgrading, or enlargementof a DoD CA involving a cost increase exceeding either 30 percent of thetotal capital investment or 30 percent of the annual personnel and materialcosts. A consolidation of two or more CAs is not an expansion, unless theproposed total capital investment or annual personnel and material costsof the consolidation exceeds the total of the individual CAs by 30 percentor more. <T3>Installation.</T3> An installation is the grouping of facilities, collocatedin the same vicinity, that supports particular functions. Activities collocatedand supported by an installation are considered to be tenants. <T3>Installation commander.</T3> The commanding officer or head of an installationor tenent activity, who has budget and supervisory control over resourcesand personnel. <T3>Mission-essential materiel.</T3> All materiel that is authorized andavailable to combat support, combat service support, and combat readinesstraining forces to accomplish their assigned mission. <T3>New requirement. </T3>A recently established need for a commercialproduct or service. A new requirement does not include interim in-houseoperation of essential services pending reacquisition of the services promptedby such action as the termination of an existing contract operation. <T3>Preferential procurement programs.</T3> Preferential procurement programsinclude mandatory source programs such as Federal Prison Industries (FPI)and the workshops administered by the Committee for Purchase from the Blindand Other Severely Handicapped under Pub. L. 92-98. Small, minority anddisadvantaged businesses; and labor surplus area set-asides and awardsmade under Pub. L. 85-536, section 8(a); and Pub. L. 95-507 are includedunder preferential procurement programs. <T3>Right of first refusal of employment.</T3> Contractors provide Governmentemployees, displaced as a result of the conversion to contract performance,the right of first refusal for employment openings under the contract inpositions for which they are qualified, if the employment is consistentwith post-Government employment conflict of interest standards. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 169a.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Ensure DoD mission accomplishment.</T3> When complying with this partand its policy Directive, DoD Components shall consider the overall DoDmission and the defense objective of maintaining readiness and sustainabilityto ensure a capability for mobilizing the defense and support structure.(b) <T3>Achieve economy and quality through competition. </T3>Encourage competitionwith the objective of enhancing quality, economy, and performance. Whenperformance by a commercial source is permissible, a comparison of thecost of contracting and the cost of in-house performance shall be performedto determine who shall provide the best value for the Government, consideringprice and other factors included in the solicitation. The restriction ofa solicitation to a preferential procurement program does not negate therequirement to perform a cost comparison. Performance history will be consideredin the source selection process and high quality performance should berewarded. (c) <T3>Retain governmental functions in-house. </T3>Certain functions thatare inherently governmental in nature, and intimately related to the publicinterest, mandate performance by DoD personnel only. These functions arenot in competition with commercial sources; therefore, these functionsshall be performed by DoD personnel.(d) <T3>Rely on the commercial sector.</T3> DoD Components shall rely on commerciallyavailable sources to provide commercial products and services except whenrequired for national defense, when no satisfactory commercial source isavailable, or when in the best interest of direct patient care. DoD Componentsshall not consider an in-house new requirement, an expansion of an in-houserequirement, conversion to in-house, or otherwise carry on any CAs to providecommercial products or services if the products or services can be procuredmore economically from commercial sources. (e) <T3>Delegate decision authority and responsibility.</T3> DoD Componentsshall delegate decision authority and responsibility to lower organizationlevels, giving more authority to the doers, and linking responsibilitywith that authority. This shall facilitate the work that installation commandersmust perform without limiting their freedom to do their jobs. When possible,the installation commanders should have the freedom to make intelligentuse of their resources, while preserving the essential wartime capabilitiesof U.S. support organizations in accordance with DoD Directive 4001.1.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the U.S. NavalPublications and Forms Center, Attn: Code 1053, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia,PA 19120. (f) <T3>Share resources saved.</T3> When possible, make available to the installa-tioncommander a share of any resources saved or earned so that the commandercan improve operations or working and living conditions on the installation.(g) <T3>Provide placement assistance.</T3> Provide a variety of placement assistanceto employees whose Federal jobs are eliminated through CA competitions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 169a.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Inventory and five year review schedule (Report Control Symbol DO-Pandamp;L(A)1540)</T3>.(1) Each installation commander shall have the authority and responsibilityto carry out the following: (i) Prepare an inventory each fiscal year of commercial activities carriedout by government personnel. (ii) Decide which commercial activities shall be reviewed under the proceduresand requirements of OMB Circular No. A-76 or any successor administrativeregulation or policy. (2) Each installation commander will exercise the above authority and responsibilitiesin accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in 32 CFR Part169, this part, and the DoD Component's implementing directives. (3) DoD Components shall annually compile the installation's inventoryand their review schedules. The inventory shall be updated at least annuallyto reflect changes to review schedules, the results of reviews, cost comparisons,and direct conversions. (4) Updated inventories for all DoD Components except National SecurityAgency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) and the Defense lntelligenceAgency (DIA) shall be submitted to the Office of the Assistant Secretaryof Defense (Production and Logistics) (OASD (Pandamp;L)) within 90 days afterthe end of each fiscal year. Inventory data pertaining to NSA/CSS and DIAshall be held at the specific Agency concerned for subsequent review byproperly cleared personnel. Appendix A provides the codes and explanationsfor functional areas and Appendix B provides procedures for submittingthe inventory. (5) Commerical activities approved for retention in-house, for any reason,shall be reviewed at least once every 5 years. (6) Review schedules should be coordinated with the DoD Component's EfficiencyReview Program and the Defense Regional Interservice Support (DRIS) Programto preclude duplication of efforts and to make use of information alreadyavailable. (7) Reviews of CAs that provide interservice support shall be scheduledby the supplying organization. Subsequent cost comparisons, when appropriate,shall be executed by the same organization. All affected DoD Componentsshall be notified of the intent to perform a review. (8) lnformation in the inventory may be used to assess DoD Components implementationof OMB Circular A-76 and for other purposes. (b) <T3>Reviews_(1) </T3><T3>Existing in-house CAs.</T3> Reviews shall be conducted in accordancewith established review schedules. Existing in-house CAs, once reviewed,shall be retained in-house without a cost comparison only when certainconditions are satisfied. (Detailed documentation will be maintained tosupport the decision to continue in-house performance. OASD (Pandamp;L) shallbe notified within 30 days of any such decision.) These conditions areas follows: (i) <T3>National defense</T3>. In most cases, application of this criterionshall be made considering the wartime and peacetime duties of the specificpositions involved rather than in terms of broad functions. (A) <T3>Military staffing</T3>. A CA, staffed with military personnel who areassigned to the activity, may be retained in-house for national defensereasons when the following apply: (<T3>1</T3>) The CA is essential for training or experience in requiredmilitary skills; or (<T3>2</T3>) The CA is needed to provide appropriate work assignments fora rotation base for overseas or sea-to-shore assignments; or (<T3>3</T3>) The CA is necessary to provide career progression to neededmilitary skill levels. (B) <T3>Core logistics activities.</T3> Section 2464 of Title 10, United StatesCode currently identifies as core logistics those functions performingdepot-level maintenance of mission-essential material at the activitieslisted in section 1231 of Pub. L. 99-145. These functions will not be consideredfor conversion to contract unless the Secretary of Defense grants a waiver.(<T3>1</T3>) The Secretary of Defense will consider a waiver using the followingcriteria: (<T3>i</T3>) Private sector performance will not result in adverse impactupon mobilization requirements or other readiness considerations; (<T3>ii</T3>) The private sector is capable of providing the technical competenceand resources necessary to perform the activity; (<T3>iii</T3>) The private sector is capable of performing if surges occur;(<T3>iv</T3>) The activity is separable from those core logistics activitiesthat do require performance by DoD civilian employees; (<T3>v</T3>) Essential management responsibility is retained by DoD civilianemployees; and (<T3>vi</T3>) Essential government facilities and equipment are retainedby the government. (<T3>2</T3>) If an activity meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B)(1)of this section, the DoD Component may submit a request for a waiver tothe Director. Maintenance Policy, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretaryof Defense (Logistics). The waiver request must include a written certificationthat in-house performance of the activity is no longer required for nationaldefense reasons. Waiver requests should contain quantitative informationas well as a brief narrative keyed to each of the above criteria.(<T3>3</T3>) A waiver under paragraph (b)(1)(B)(<T3>2</T3>) of this section may not take effect until:(<T3>i</T3>) The DoD Component has submitted a report on the waiver to theCommittees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives.(<T3>ii</T3>) A period of 20 days of continuous session of Congress or 40calendar days has passed after the receipt of the report by those committees.(<T3>4</T3>) DoD Components may propose additional logistics capabilityfor inclusions in the list of core logistics activities to the Director,Maintenance Policy OASD (Pandamp;L)L/MD with a copy to the Chief, InstallationsSupport Division, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations).(C) <T3>Consolidation of essential military personnel. </T3>If the DoD Componenthas a large number of similar CAs with a small number of essential militarypersonnel in each CA, action shall be taken, when appropriate, to consolidatethe military positions consistent with military requirements so that economicalperformance by either DoD civilian employees or by contract can be exploredfor accomplishing a portion of the work.(D) <T3>New criteria. </T3>The DoD Components may propose to the OASD (Pandamp;L)other criteria for exempting CAs for national defense reasons.(ii) <T3>No satisfactory commercial source available.</T3> A DoD CA may be performedby DoD personnel when it can be demonstrated that: (A) There is no satisfactory commercial source capable of providing theproduct or service that is needed. Before concluding that there is no satisfactorycommercial source available, all reasonable efforts, shall be made to identifyavailable sources. (<T3>1</T3>) Efforts to find satisfactory commercial sources shall be carriedout in accordance with the FAR and DFARS and include review of bidderslists and inventories of contractors, consideration of preferential procurementprograms, and requests for help from government agencies such as the SmallBusiness Administration. (<T3>2</T3>) Where the availability of commercial sources is uncertain,at least three notices of the requirement will be placed in the CBD overa 90 calendar-day period. (Notices shall be in the format specified inthe FAR, Chapter 1, Part 5. When a bona fide urgent requirement occurs,the publication period in the CBD may be reduced to two notices over a30 calendarday period. Specifications and requirements in the notice shallnot be unduly restrictive and shall not exceed those required of Governmentpersonnel or operations. (B) Use of a commercial source would cause an unacceptable delay or disruptionof an essential program. In-house operation of a CA on the basis that useof a commercial source would cause an unacceptable delay or disrupt anessential DoD program requires documentation. (<T3>1</T3>) The delay or disruption must be specific as to cost, time,and performance measures. (<T3>2</T3>) The disruption must be shown to be of a lasting or unacceptablenature. Temporary disruption caused by conversion to contract is not sufficientsupport for the use of this criterion. (<T3>3</T3>) The fact that a DoD CA involves a classified program, or ispart of a DoD Component's basic mission, or that there is the possibilityof a strike by contract employees is not adequate reason for Governmentperformance of that activity. Further, urgency alone is not an adequatereason to continue Government operation of a CA. It must be shown thatcommercial sources are not able, and the Government is able, to providethe product or service when needed. (<T3>4</T3>) Use of an exemption due to an unacceptable delay or disruptionof an essential program shall be approved by the DoD Component. (iii) <T3>Patient care.</T3> Commercial activities at DoD hospitals may be performedby DoD civilian personnel when it is determined by the head of the DoDComponent or a designee, in consultation with the DoD Component's chiefmedical director, that performance by DoD personnel would be in the bestinterest of direct patient care. (iv) <T3>Public laws.</T3> Commercial activities may continue to be performedby DoD Civilian personnel when higher authority exempts contracting outDoD in-house performance such as, fire fighter, guard service and specifiedinstallations. (v) <T3>Military construction.</T3> An economic analyses required by Pub. L.97-214 eliminates the need for a cost comparison of a CA. (2) <T3>Contracts. </T3>(i) When contract costs become unreasonable, performancebecomes unsatisfactory, or a contractor defaults, a cost comparison ofthe contracted CA shall be performed in accordance with Parts II, III,and IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 \2\<NOTE/> if the following apply:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies may be obtained from the Executive Office of thePresident, Publications Services, New Executive Office Building, Room 2200,725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503.(A) Interim in-house operation may he established on a temporary basisshould a contractor default;(B) Re-competition with other satisfactory commercial sources does notresult in reasonable prices; and(C) In-house performance is feasible.(ii) Contracted CAs that are justified for conversion to in-house performancebased on cost comparisons, national defense, or in the best interest ofdirect patient care will be allowed to expire (options will not be exercised)once in-house capability is established. If the required resources cannotbe accommodated within the DoD Component's budget, a request for adjustmentshall be submitted to OSD.(3) <T3>Expansions. </T3>In cases where expansion of an in-house CA is anticipated,a review of the entire CA, including the proposed expansion, shall be conductedto determine if performance by DoD personnel is authorized for nationaldefense reasons, because no commercial source is available, or becauseit is in the best interest of direct patient care. lf performance by DoDpersonnel is not justified under these criteria, a cost comparison of theentire activity shall be performed. Government facilities and equipmentnormally will not be expanded to accommodate expansions if adequate andcost effective contractor facilities are available.(4) <T3>New Requirements</T3> (i) In cases where a new requirement for a commercialproduct or service is anticipated, a review shall be conducted to determineif performance by DoD personnel is authorized for national defense reasons,because no commercial source is available, or because it is in the bestinterest of direct patient care. If performance by DoD personnel is notjustified under these criteria, then the new requirement normally shallbe performed by contract.(ii) If there is reason to believe that commercial prices may be unreasonable,an informal preliminary cost analysis shall be conducted to determine whetherit is likely that the work can be performed in-house at a cost that isless than anticipated for contract performance. lf in-house performanceappears to be more economical, a cost comparison shall be scheduled. Theappropriate conversion differentials will be added to the preliminary in-housecost before it is determined that in-house performance is likely to bemore economical.(iii) Government facilities and equipment normally will not be expandedto accommodate new requirements if adequate and cost-effective contractorfacilities are available. The requirement for Government ownership of facilitiesdoes not obviate the possibility of contract operation. If justificationfor in-house operation is dependent on relative cost, the cost comparisonmay be delayed to accommodate the lead time necessary for acquiring thefacilities.(iv) Approval to budget for a major capital investment associated witha new requirement will not constitute OSD approval to perform the new requirementwith DoD personnel. Government performance shall be determined as statedin this Instruction.(5) <T3>CAs involving 45 or fewer DoD civilian employees. </T3>(i) When adequatelyjustified under the criteria required in Appendix C, CAs involving 45 orfewer DoD civilian employees may be converteddirectly to contract basedon simplified cost comparison procedures. Such conversions shall be approvedby the DoD Component CA central point of contact office. This approvalauthority may be redelegated. Part IV of the Supplement to OMR CircularA-76 shall be used to define the specific elements of cost to be estimatedin the simplified cost comparison.(ii) A full cost comparison shall be performed when a simplified cost comparisonfails to clearly support direct conversion to contract.(iii) If the activity involves 11 to 45 DoD civilian employees, the simplifiedcost comparison shall indicate that an analysis of the most efficient andcost-effective organization has been completed and that the in-house costestimate is based on this analysis.(iv) In no case shall any CA involving more than 45 DoD civilian employeesbe modified, reorganized, divided, or in any way changed for the purposeof circumventing the requirement to perform a full cost comparison.(v) Upon approval of a direct conversion, approval notification and (forconversions involving 11 to 45 DoD civilian employees) a copy of the simplifiedcost comparison fact sheet, with back-up data, shall be provided to theCommittee on Appropriations, U.S. House of Representatives, H-218, TheCapital, Washington, D.C. 20515. Also the same shall be provided to theCommittee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,D.C. 20515 and to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Productionand Logistics) Installations OASD (Pandamp;L)I, Room 3E787, The Pentagon,Washington, D.C. 20301.(vi) The decision to directly convert a CA involving military personnelreflects a management decision that the work need not be performed by militarypersonnel. Therefore, all direct personnel costs will be estimated in thesimplified cost comparison on the basis of civilian performance.(vii) Those activities involving more than 45 DoD civilian employees shallundergo full cost comparisons and be reported to Congress as required bythis part before conversion to contract performance.(6) <T3>CAs lnvolving 10 or Fewer DoD Civilian Employees. </T3>Commercial activitiesperformed by 10 or fewer civilian employees may be converted to contractwithout a simplified cost comparison provided that:(i) Before any such conversion takes place, the installation commandermust certify that all affected civilian employees will be offered jobsat that installation or within the local area, commensurate (equal payscales and grade levels) with their current skills and pay grades. If nosuch vacancies exist, the employees will be offered retraining opportunitiesfor existing or projected vacancies at that installation or within thelocal area. The employees potential right-of-first-refusal with civiliancontractors does not satisfy this requirement.(ii) This provision, subject to the previously mentioned conditions, willbe an option available to each DoD Component. This authority may be delegateddown to the installation commander.(7) <T3>Military Personnel CAs. </T3>Commercial activities performed exclusivelyby military personnel may be converted to contract without a cost comparison,when adequate competition is available and reasonable prices can be obtainedfrom qualified commercial sources.(8) <T3>Special Considerations</T3>_(i) <T3>Signals lntelligence and Telecommunications and Automated lnformationSystems Security. </T3>Before making a determination that an activity involvingSignals lntelligence (SIGINT), as prescribed by E.0. 12333 and Telecommunicationsand Automated lnformation Systems Security, as prescribed by National SecurityDecision Directive (NSDD) 145, should be subjected to a cost comparison,the DoD Component must specifically identify the risk to national securityby using commercial sources. The DoD Component shall provide its assessmentof the risk to national security by using commercial sources to the Director,National Security Agency (NSA), who shall determine if the risk to nationalsecurity is unacceptable. NSA shall notify the OASD (Pandamp;L) within 30days of action taken by the Director, NSA, to grant or deny a request fora waiver of the provisions to this part.(ii) <T3>National intelligence. </T3>Before making a determination that an activityinvolving the collections, processings, productions, or dissemination ofnational intelligence as prescribed in E.O. 12333 should be subjected toa cost comparison, the DoD Component must specifically identify the riskto national intelligence by using commercial sources. Except as noted inparagraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the DoD Component shall provide itsassessment of the risk to national intelligence by using commercial sourcesto the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), who shall make thedetermination if the risk to national intelligence is unacceptable. DIAshall consult with other organizations as deemed necessary and shall providethe decision to the DoD Component. DIA shall notify OASD (Pandamp;L.) within30 days of action taken by the Director, DIA, to grant or deny a requestfor a waiver to this part. (iii)<T3> Accountable officer.</T3> (A) The functions and responsibilities ofthe Accountable Officer are defined by DoD 7200.10-M. Those functions ofthe Accountable Officer that involve the exercise of substantive discretionaryauthority in determining the Government's requirements and controllingGovernment assets cannot be performed by a contractor and must be retainedin-house. The responsibilities of the Accountable Officer as an individualand the position of the Accountable Officer are not contractible. (B) Contractors can perform functions to support the Accountable Officerand functions where they are performing in accordance with criteria definedby the Government. For instance, contractors can process requisitions,maintain stock control records, perform storage and warehousing, and makelocal procurements of items specified as deliverables in the contract.(C) The responsibility for administrative fund control must be retainedin-house. The contractor can process all required paperwork up to fundsobligation that must be done by the Goverment employee designated as responsiblefor funds control. The contractor can also process such documents as reportsof survey and adjustments to stockage levels, but approval must rest withthe Accountable Officer. In all cases the administrative control of fundsmust be retained by the Government since a contractor or contractor employeescannot be held responsible for violations of former section 3679 of therevised statutes (now codified at sections 1341, 1342, and 1517 of Title31, United States Code). (c) <T3>Cost comparison process. </T3>If performance of a CA by DoD personnelcannot be justified under national defense, nonavailability of commercialsource, or patient care criteria, then a full cost comparison shall beconducted in accordance with Parts II, III, and IV of the Supplement toOMB Circular A-76, to determine if performance by DoD employees is justifiedon the basis of lower cost (unless the criteria of paragraphs (b) (5),(6) and (7) of this section are met). The conclusion that a CA does notrequire in-house performance reflects a management decision that the workneed not be accomplished by military personnel. Therefore, all direct personnelcosts shall be estimated on the basis of civilian performance. Funds shallbe budgeted to cover either the cost of the appropriate in-house operationrequired to accomplish the work or the estimated cost of the contract.(1) <T3>Notification </T3>(i) <T3>Congressional notification. </T3>DoD Components shall notify Congressof the intention to do a full cost comparison for each CA, only when Congressis in session and in sufficient time to allow review, as required by section502(a)(2)(A). DoD Components shall annotate the notification when a costcomparison is planned at an activity listed in the report to Congress oncore logistics (see paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section). DoD Componentswho do not have Legislative Affairs (LA) and Public Affairs (PA) officesshall notify the OASD (Pandamp;L) of any such intent at least 5 working daysbefore the Congressional notification. DoD Components that clear theirCongressional notifications with their LA and PA offices shall providea copy of the CA decision on the day of announcement to: OASD (LA) Room3D918 Pentagon; OASD (PA) Room 2E757 Pentagon, Office of Economic Adjustment,Room 4C767 Pentagon and DASD (i) Room 3E787 Pentagon. The cost comparisonprocess begins on the date of Congressional notification. (ii) <T3>Commerce Business Daily (CBD)/</T3><T4>Federal Register</T4> <T3>(FR) notification. </T3>Schedules for cost comparisons not requiringCongressional notification and decisions to convert CAs directly to contractalso shall be published in the CBD/FR as soon as practicable after thedecision. The cost comparison decision schedule shall include for eachactivity, the name, location, and date the cost comparison began or theestimated date the direct conversion will occur. (iii) <T3>Local notification. </T3>(A) It is suggested that upon Congressionalnotification the installation make an announcement of the cost comparison,including a brief explanation of the cost comparison process to the employeesof the activity and the community.(B) DoD Components shall, in accordance with Pub. L. 100-456, at leastmonthly during the development and preparation of the performance workstatement (PWS) and management study, consult with DoD civilian employeeswho will be affected by the cost comparison and consider the views of suchemployees on the development and preparation of the PWS and managementstudy. DoD Components may consult with such employees on other mattersrelating to the cost comparison. In the case of DoD employees representedby a labor organization accorded exclusive recognition under section 7111of Title 5, United States Code, consultation with representatives of thatlabor organization satisfies the consultation requirement. Consultationwith non-union DoD civilian employees may be through such means as groupmeetings. Alternatively, DoD civilian employees may be invited to designateone or more representatives to speak for them. Other methods may be implemented,as long as adequate notice is provided to the non-union DoD civilian employeesand the right to be represented during the consultations is ensured. (C) Local Interservice Support Coordinators (ISCs) and the Chair of theappropriate Joint Interservice Resources Study Group (JIRSG) also shouldbe notified of a pending cost comparison. (2) <T3>Performance work statement (PWS).</T3> (i) The PWS and its QualityAssurance Plan shall be prepared in accordance with Part ii of the Supplementto OMB Circular A-76 for full cost comparisons, simplified cost comparisons,and direct conversions. The PWS shall include reasonable performance standards,allowing for continuous quality improvement, that can be used to ensurea comparable level of performance for both Government and contractor anda common basis for evaluation. Employees and/or their bargaining unit representativesshould be encouraged to participate in preparing or reviewing the PWS.(ii) Each DoD Component shall: (A) Prepare PWSs where needed. (B) Monitor the development and use of prototype PWSs. There are over 300 prototype PWSs and 500 CA studies available throughthe Defense Logistics Studies Information Exchange (DLSIE). Inquiries areencouraged from all DoD Components. Call Autovon 687-4255 or Commercial(804) 734-4255 or write to: USA Logistics Management College, ATTN: DLSIE,Bldg. T-12112, Fort Lee, VA. 23801-6048. (C) Review and initiate action to correct disagreements on PWS discrepancies.(D) Approve prototype PWSs for Component-wide use. (E) Coordinate these efforts with the other DoD Components to avoid duplicationand to provide mutual assistance. (iii) Guidance on Government Property: (A) For the purposes of this Instruction, Government property is definedin accordance with the FAR, Part 45. (B) The decision to offer or not to offer Government property to a contractorshall be determined by an informal cost analysis. This decision must besupported by current, accurate, complete information and be readily availablefor the independent reviewing activity. The design of this analysis shallnot give a decided advantage/disadvantage to either in-house or contractcompetitors. The management of Government property offered to the contractorshall also be in compliance with the FAR, Part 45. (iv) If a CA provides critical or sensitive services, the PWS shall includesufficient data for the in-house organization and commercial sources toprepare a plan for expansion in emergency situations. (v) DoD Components that provide interservice support to other DoD Componentsor Federal agencies through interservice support agreements or other arrangements,shall ensure that the PWS includes this workload and is coordinated withall affected components and agencies. (vi) If there is a requirement for the commercial source to have accessto classified information in order to provide the product or service, thecommercial source shall be processed for a facility security clearanceunder the Defense Industrial Security Program in accordance with DoD Directive5220.223 \3\<NOTE/> and DoD 5220.22-R. However, if no <T3>bona fide </T3>requirement for access to classified information exists,no action shall be taken to obtain security clearance for the commercialsource. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 169a.4(e) (vii) Employees of commercial sources who do not require access to classifiedinformation for work performance, but require entry into restricted areasof the installation, may be authorized unescorted entry only when the provisionsof 32 CFR Part 154 apply. (3) <T3>Management study. </T3>A management study shall be performed to completelyanalyze the method of operation necessary to establish the most efficientand cost-effective in-house organization (MEO) needed to accomplish therequirements in the PWS. The MEO must reflect only those resources whichhave been authorized for the CA. As a part of the management study, installationsshould determine if specific requirements can be met through an Inter/IntraserviceSupport Agreement (ISA) with other activities or Government Agencies whichhave excess capacity or capability.(i) The CA management study is mandatory. Part III of the supplement toOMB Circular A-76 provides guidance on how to conduct the management study.The study shall identify essential functions to be performed, determineperformance factors, organization structure, staffing, and operating proceduresfor the most efficient and cost effective in-house performance of the CA.The MEO becomes the basis of the Government estimate for the cost comparisonwith potential contractors. In this context, ``efficient'' (or cost-effective)means that the required level of workload (output, as described in theperformance work statement) is accomplished with as little resource consumption(input) as possible without degradation in the required quality level ofproducts or services. (ii) DoD Components have formal programs and training for the performanceof management studies, and those programs are appropriate for teachinghow to conduct CA management studies. Part III of the Supplement to OMBCircular A-76 does not purport to replace the DoD Component's own managementtechniques, but merely to establish the basic criteria and the interrelationshipbetween the management study and the PWS. (iii) If a CA provides critical or sensitive services, the management studyshall include a plan for expansion in emergency situations. (iv) Early in the management study, management will solicit the views ofthe employees in the CA under review, and/or their representatives fortheir recommendations as to the MEO or ways to improve the method of operation.(v) The management study will be the basis on which the DoD Component certifiesthat the in-house cost estimate is based on the most efficient and costeffective organization practicable.(vi) Implementation of the MEO shall be initiated no later than l monthafter cancellation of the solicitation and completed within 6 months. DoDComponents shall take action, within l month, to schedule and conduct asubsequent cost comparison when the MEO is not initiated and completedas previously prescribed. Subsequent cost comparisons may be delayed bythe DoD Component's central point of contact office, when situations outsidethe control of the DoD Component may prevent timely or full implementationof the MEO. This authority may not be redelegated.(vii) DoD Components shall establish procedures to ensure that the in-houseoperation, as specified in the MEO, is capable of performing in accordancewith the requirements of the PWS. The procedures also shall ensure thatthe resources (facilities, equipment, and personnel) specified in the MEOare available to the in-house operation and that in-house performance remainswithin the requirements and resources specified in the PWS and MEO forthe period of the cost comparison, unless documentation to support changesin workload/scope is available. (viii) A management study is not required for CAs involving 10 or fewerDoD civilian employees or direct conversions of military personnel. (4) <T3>Cost Comparisons.</T3> Cost comparisons shall include all significantcosts of both Government and contract performance. Common costs; that is,costs that would be the same for either in-house or contract operation,need not be computed, but the basis of those common costs must be identifiedand included in the cost comparison documentation. Part IV of the Supplementto OMB Circular A-76 provides the basic guidance for conducting full costcomparisons. Appendix C provides guidance for conducting simplified costcomparisons. The supplemental guidance contained below is intended to establishuniformity and to ensure all factors are considered when making cost comparisons.Deviation from the guidance contained in Part IV of the supplement to OMBCircular A-76 will not be allowed, except as provided in the followingparagraphs. (i) <T3>In-house cost estimate.</T3> (A) The in-house cost estimate shall bebased on the most efficient and cost-effective in-house organization neededto accomplish the requirements in the PWS. (B) Heads of DoD Components or their designees shall certify that the in-housecost estimate is based on the most efficient and cost-effective operationpracticable. Such certification shall be made prior to the date for receiptof offers. (C) The Comptroller of the Department of Defense (C, DoD) shall provideannual inflation factors for adjusting costs for the first and subsequentperformance periods. Alternative economic assumptions may also be usedif they are separately identified and the effect of the C, DoD rates arealso shown for comparison. Inflation factors for outyear (second and subsequent)performance periods will not be applied to portions of the in-house estimatethat are comparable with those portions of the contract estimate subjectto economic price adjustment clauses. These factors apply to all cost comparisonswhere bid opening or receipt of best and final offer has not occurred.If the in-house cost estimate has been sealed, adjustment should be madeat the time adjustments are made to the contractor portion of the costcomparison form. The new factor(s) should be applied to the cost elementat the largest aggregate level. (D) Military positions in the organization under cost comparison shallbe converted to civilian positions for costing purposes. Civilian gradesand series shall be based on the work described in the PWS and reflectedin the MEO that is determined by the management study rather than on thecurrent organization structure. (E) All DoD Components shall use the Wholesale Stock Fund Rate of 19.1percent and the Direct Delivery Rate of 13.6 percent for supplies and materialsacquired from the DoD Component supply systems. (F) DoD Components shall assume for the purpose of depreciation computationsthat residual value is equal to the disposal values listed in AppendixC of Part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76, if more precise figuresare not available from the property disposal officer or other knowledgeableauthority. Therefore, the basis for depreciation shall be the originalcost plus the cost of capital improvements (if any) less the residual value.The original cost plus the cost of capital improvements less the residualvalue shall be divided by the useful life (as projected for the CA costcomparison) to determine the annual depreciation. (G) Purchased services which augment the current in-house work effort andthat are included in the PWS should be included in line 3 (other specificallyattributable costs). The purchased service price used must reflect an actualcontract price; not an estimated price based in past experience. When thesepurchased services are long-term and contain labor costs subject to economicprice adjustment clauses, then the applicable labor portion will not beescalated by outyear inflation factors. In addition, purchased servicesshall be offset for potential Federal income tax revenue by applying theappropriate rate in Appendix D of Part IV of the Supplement to OMB CircularA-76 to the total cost of purchased services. (H) Overhead costs shall be computed only when such costs will not continuein the event of contract performance. This includes the cost of any position(full time, part time, or intermittent) that is dedicated to providingsupport to the activity(ies) under cost comparison regardless of the supportorganization's location. Military positions providing overhead supportshall be costed using current military composite standard rates. Theserates are issued on a fiscal year basis by each Military Service. (I) The following guidance pertains to the Davis-Bacon Act and ServiceContract Act: (<T3>1</T3>) Normally, construction and major repair projects will be contractedfor separately. However, requirements in a contract (subject to the ServiceContract Act) calling for construction, alteration, renovation, painting,and repair work performed in response to a service call or work order inexcess of $2,000 shall be subject to the Davis-Bacon Act. (<T3>2</T3>) Maintenance work and other installation support work, suchas plant operations and installation services (custodial, snow removal,entomology, etc.), shall be subject to the Service Contract Act. (<T3>3</T3>) All requirements not subject to the Davis-Bacon Act, as previouslydescribed, shall be subject to the Service Contract Act. (<T3>4</T3>) Under no circumstances will an attempt be made to evade thecoverage of the Davis-Bacon Act by breaking tasks in excess of $2,000 intosmaller tasks to accomplish requirements in the contract for repair, construction,alteration, renovation, or painting. (<T3>5</T3>) Service call or work order estimates to be used in determiningthe applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act shall be based on the least costalternative. (J) Medicare factors will be used in the calculation of civilian personnelcosts using the computation shown. Medicare factors are only applied upto the current annual salary limitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">[(Basic pay x fringe benefit factor) + (Other Pay x Medicare Factor)]= Personnel Cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> The fringe benefit factor includes cost factors for standardretirement, employee insurance benefits (life and health), medicare, andmiscellaneous fringe benefits.</ITAG>(K) The C, DoD shall provide guidance to DoD Components on procedures andsystems for obtaining cost data for use in preparing cost estimates, whenrequested. (ii) <T3>Cost of Contract Performance. </T3> (A) The contract cost estimateshall be based on offers competitively obtained and solicited in accordancewith the FAR and the DFARS for full cost comparisons. Existing contractprices (such as those from GSA Supply Schedules) will not be used in acost comparison. For simplified cost comparisons, the guidance in AppendixC applies. (B) Standby costs are costs incurred for the upkeep of property in standbystatus. Such costs neither add to the value of the property nor prolongits life, but keep it in efficient operating condition or available foruse. When an in-house activity is converted to contract performance andan agency elects to hold Government equipment and facilities on standbysolely to maintain performance capability, this is a management decision,and such standby costs will not be charged to the cost of contracting.(C) A specific waiver is required to use contract administration factorsthat exceed the limits established in table 3-1 of Part IV of the Supplementto OMB Circular A-76. The reason for the deviation from the limits, thesupporting alternative computation, and documentation supporting the alternativemethod, shall be provided to the DoD Component's central point of contactoffice for advance approval on a case-by-case basis. This authority maynot be redelegated. OASD (Pandamp;L) shall be notified within 30 days ofany such decisions. (D) The following guidance pertains to one-time conversion costs: (<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Material Related Costs.</T3> The cost factors below shall be used,if more precise costs are not known, to estimate the cost associated withdisposal/transfer of excess government material which result from a conversionto contract performance: <ITAG tagnum="81">Percentage of Current Replacement Cost </ITAG>Packing, Crating, andamp; Handling (PCH)_3.5 percent. Transportation_3.75 percent. (<T3>2</T3>) <T3>Labor-Related Costs.</T3> If unique circumstances prevail when a strictapplication of the 2 percent factor for computation of severance pay resultsin a substantial overstatement or understatement of this cost, an alternativemethodology may be employed. The reason for the deviation from this standard,the alternative computation, and documentation supporting the alternativemethod shall be provided to the appropriate DoD Component's central pointof contact office for advance approval on a case-by-case basis. This authoritymay not be redelegated. OASD (Pandamp;L) shall he notified within 30 daysof any such decision. (<T3>3</T3>) <T3>Other Transition Costs.</T3> Normally, Government personnel assistanceafter the contract start date (to assist in transition from in-house performanceto contract performance) should not be necessary. When transition assistancewill not be made available, this condition should be stated clearly inthe solicitation so that contractors will be informed that they will beexpected to meet full performance requirements from the first date of thecontract. Also, when circumstances require full performance on the contractstart date, the solicitation shall state that time will be made availablefor contractor indoctrination prior to the start date of the contract.The inclusion of personnel transition costs in a cost comparison requiresadvance approval of the DoD Component's central point of contact office.This authority may not be redelegated. OASD (Pandamp;L) shall be notifiedwithin 30 days of any such decision. (E) <T3>Gain or Loss on Disposal/Transfer of Assets.</T3> If more precise costsare not available from the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office or appropriateauthority, then: (<T3>1</T3>) The same factors for PCH and transportation costs as prescribedin paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section for the costs associated withdisposal/transfer of materials may be used. (<T3>2</T3>) The estimated disposal value may be calculated from the netbook value as derived from the table in Appendix C of Part IV of the Supplementto OMB Circular A-76 minus the disposal/transfer costs. This figure shallbe entered as a gain or loss on line 11 or line 13 of the cost comparisonform as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> If a cost-benefit analysis, as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)of this section indicates that the retention of Government-owned facilities,equipment, or real property for use elsewhere in the Government is costadvantageous to the Government, then the cost comparison form shall reflecta gain to the Government and therefore a decrease to the cost of contractingon line 11 or line 13 of the cost comparison form as appropriate </ITAG>(5) <T3>Independent review. </T3>(i) The estimates of in-house and contractcosts that can be computed before the cost comparison shall be reviewedby a qualified activity, independent of the Task Group preparing the costcomparison. This review shall be completed far enough in advance of theinitial proposal opening date to allow correction of any discrepanciesfound prior to submitting the in-house proposal to the contracting officer.(ii) The independent review shall substantiate the currency, reason-ableness,accuracy, and completeness of the cost comparison. The review shall ensurethat the in-house cost estimate is based on the same required services,performance standards, and workload contained in the solicitation. Thereviewer shall scrutinize and attest to the adequacy and authenticity ofthe supporting documentation. Supporting documentation shall be sufficientto require no additional interpretation. (iii) The purpose of the independent review is to ensure costs have beenestimated and supported in accordance with provisions of this part. Ifno (or only minor) discrepancies are noted during this review, the reviewerindicates the minor discrepancies, signs, dates, and returns the CCF tothe preparer. If significant discrepancies are noted during the review,the discrepancies shall be reported to the preparer for recommended correctionand resubmission. (iv) An independent review is not required for CAs involving 45 or fewerDoD civilian employees. (v) Independent review evaluations and certification shall be affixed tothe CCF.(6) <T3>Solicitation Considerations</T3>. (i) lnstallation commanders havethe authority and responsibility to solicit contracts for those activitiesselected for possible conversion to contract in accordance with the FARand the DFARS. The solicitation will not be canceled even if there aresignificant changes, omissions, or defects in the Government's in-housecost estimate. Such corrections shall be made before the expiration and/orextension of offers from contractors. (ii) Offerors shall be informed that an in-house cost estimate is beingdeveloped and that a contract may or may not result. (iii) Offers from contractors shall be on at least a 3-year multi-yearbasis (where appropriate) or shall include prepriced renewal options tocover 2 years after the initial period. Offers longer then 3 years areencouraged in order to receive cost efficient offers from quality contractors.Currently, there are no statutory limitations on option provisions, sincethey are unilateral in nature, unfunded and not contractually binding,however a deviation from the FAR, section 17.204, paragraph e is requiredfor basic and option periods exceeding 5 years. (iv) All contracts awarded as a result of a conversion (whether or nota cost comparison was performed) shall: (A) Comply with all requirements of the FAR. (B) When determined to be necessary in accordance with FAR 22.101-1(e),include the clause at FAR 52.222-1, Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes,requiring the contractor to provide notice of actual and impending labordisputes. (C) Include in contracts for critical or sensitive services a requirementfor the contractor to develop a contingency plan explaining how the contractorwill expand operations in emergency situations and ensure there will beno significant interruption of routine contract services due to labor disputes.(D) Include all applicable clauses and provisions related to the rightof first refusal for employment by displaced DoD employees, equal employmentopportunities, veterans preference, and minimum wages and fringe benefits.Installation commanders have the authority and responsibility to assist,to the maximum extent practicable, in finding suitable employment for anyemployee of the Department of Defense who is displaced because of a contractentered into with a contractor for performance of a commercial activity.(E) As a general rule, requirements (for other than construction relatedservices) above the levels established for bonds and insurance in the FARand DFARS should not be included in acquisitions. (v) Solicitations shall be restricted for preferential procurement whenthe requirements applicable to such programs (such as Small Business Set-Asidesor other required sources of supplies and services) are met, in accordancewith the FAR. Solicitations will not be restricted for preferential procurementunless the contracting officer determines that there is not a reasonableexpectation that the commercial prices will be fair and reasonable. (vi) Contract defaults may result in temporary performance by Governmentpersonnel or other suitable means; such as, an interim contract source.Personnel detailed to such a temporary assignment should be clearly informedthat they will return to their permanent assignment when a new contractis awarded. If the default occurs within the first year of contract performance,the following procedures apply: (A) If, after consultation with the Department of Labor, (DoL) it is determinedthat the contract wage rates are still valid, the contracting officer willreview the availability among the next lowest responsible and responsiveofferors for a successor contract in accordance with established contractingpractice. lf the next low offeror is willing to accept the balance of thecontract work at the price offered, adjusted on an appropriate pro ratabasis for the remainder of the contract term, the contracting officer mayaward to that offeror. If the Government is the next lowest offeror, thefunction may be returned to in-house performance, as offered, if stillfeasible. If performance by DoD employees is no longer feasible, the contractingofficer may elect either to award to the next lowest responsive and responsiblecommercial offeror, if that firm is willing to perform at its offered priceand adjust appropriately for the remainder of the term, or to resolicitas specified in the next paragraph. A return to in-house performance underthe previously mentioned criteria shall be approved by the DoD Component'scentral point of contact office. This authority may not be redelegated.OASD (Pandamp;L) shall be notified within 30 days of any such decision. (B) If the contract wage rates are no longer valid or if the contractingofficer, after a review of the availability of the next lowest responsibleand responsive offerors, determines that resolicitation is appropriate,the Government may submit a cost estimate for comparison with other offersfrom the private sector. Submission of a Government cost estimate requiresa determination by the DoD Component that performance by Government personnelis still feasible and that a likelihood exists that in-house performancemay be more economical than performance by contract. In such cost comparisons,the conversion differentials will not be applied to the costs of eitherin-house or contract performance. (vii) If contract default occurs during the second or subsequent year ofcontract performance, the procedures of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this sectionapply. (viii) Grouping of commercial activities (CAs): (A) The installation commandershall determine carefully which CAs should be grouped in a single solicitation.The installation commander should keep in mind that the grouping of CAscan influence the amount of competition (number of commercial firms thatwill submit offers) and the eventual cost to the Government. (B) The installation commander shall consider the adverse impacts thatthe grouping of CAs into a single solicitation may have on small and smalldisadvantaged business concerns. CAs being performed wholly by small orsmall disadvantaged businesses will not be incorporated into a cost comparisonunless consolidation is necessary to meet mission requirements. Also caremust be taken to ensure that such contractors are not displaced merelyto accomplish consolidation. Similarly, care must be taken so that nonincumbentsmall and small disadvantaged business contractors are not handicappedor prejudiced unduly from competing effectively at the prime contractorlevel. (C) In developing solicitations for CAs, the installation commander'sprocurement plan should reflect an analysis of the advantages and disadvantagesto the Government that might result from making more than one award. Theinstallation commander's decision to group CAs should reflect an analysisof all relevant factors including the following: (<T3>1</T3>) The effect on competition.(<T3>2</T3>) The duplicative management functions and costs to be eliminatedthrough grouping. (<T3>3</T3>) The economies of administering multifunction versus single-functioncontracts, including cost risks associated with the pricing structure ofeach. (<T3>4</T3>) The feasibility of separating unrelated functional tasks orgroupings. (<T3>5</T3>) The effect grouping will have on the performance of the functions.(D) When the solicitation package includes totally independent functionswhich are clearly divisible, severable, limited in number, and not priceinterrelated, they shall be solicited on the basis of an ``any or all''offer. Commercial offerors shall be permitted to submit offers on one orany combination of the functions being solicited. These offers shall beevaluated to determine the lowest aggregate contract cost to the Government.This lowest aggregate contract cost then will be compared to the in-housecost estimate based on the MEO for performance of the functions in thesingle solicitation. The procedures in Part IV of the Supplement to OMBCircular A-76 apply.(E) There are instances when this approach to contracting for CAs may notapply; such as, situations when physical limitations of site (where theactivities are to be performed) preclude allowing more than one contractorto perform, when the function cannot be divided for purposes of performanceaccountability, or for other national security considerations. However,if an ``all or none'' solicitation is issued, the decision to do so mustinclude a cost analysis to reflect that the ``all or none'' solicitationis less costly to the Government or an analysis indicating it is otherwisein the best interest of the Government, all factors considered. (F) It is recognized that in some cases, decisions will result in the eliminationof prime contracting opportunities for small business. In such cases specialmeasures shall be taken. At a minimum, small and small disadvantaged businessconcerns shall be given preferential consideration by all competing primecontractors in the award of subcontracts. For negotiated procurements thedegree to which this is accomplished will be a weighted factor in the evaluationand source selection process leading to contract award. (G) The contract files shall be documented fully to demonstrate compliancewith these procedures. (ix) If no offers, or no responsive or responsible offers are receivedin response to a solicitation, the in-house cost estimate shall remainunopened. The contracting officer shall examine the solicitation to ascertainwhy no responses were received. Depending on the results of this review,the contracting officer shall consider restructuring the requirement, iffeasible, and reissue it under restricted or unrestricted solicitationprocedures, as appropriate. (x) Continuation of an in-house CA for lack of a satisfactory commercialsource will not be based upon lack of response to a restricted solicitation.(xi) 32 CFR Part 285 shall be considered in responding to requests fordisclosure of contractor-supplied information obtained in the course ofprocurements. (7) <T3>Administrative appeal procedures_</T3>(i) <T3>Appeals of full cost comparison decisions. </T3>(A) Each DoD Componentshall establish an administrative appeals procedure to resolve questionsfrom directly affected parties relating to determinations resulting fromfull cost comparisons (involving 46 or more DoD civilian employees) performedin compliance with this part. The appeal procedure shall not apply to questionsconcerning: (<T3>1</T3>) Award to one contractor in preference to another. (<T3>2</T3>) DoD management decisions. (B) The appeals procedure is established to provide an administrative safeguardto ensure that DoD Component decisions are fair, equitable, and done accordingto the procedures in this part. The procedure does not authorize an appealoutside the DoD Component or a judicial review. (C) The appeals procedure shall be independent, objective, and providefor a decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of theappeal. The decision shall be made by an impartial official at a levelorganizationally higher than the official who approved the cost comparisondecision. The appeal decision shall be final, unless the DoD Componentprocedures provide for further discretionary review within the DoD Component.(D) All detailed documentation supporting the initial cost comparison decisionto directly affected parties shall be made available upon request whenthe initial decision is announced. The detailed documentation shall include,at a minimum: the in-house cost estimate with detailed supporting documentation(see paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this part), completed CCF, name of the tentativewinning contractor (if the decision is to contract), or price of the offerorwhose offer would have been most advantageous to the Government (if thedecision is to perform in-house). If the documentation is not availablewhen the initial decision is announced, the time allotted for submissionof appeals shall be extended the number of days equal to the delay. (E) To be considered eligible for review under the DoD Component appealsprocedures, appeals shall: (<T3>1</T3>) Be received by the DoD Component in writing within 15 workingdays after the date the supporting documentation is made available to directlyaffected parties. (<T3>2</T3>) Address specific line items on the CCF and the rationale forquestioning those items. (<T3>3</T3>) Demonstrate that the result of the appeal may change the decision.(ii) <T3>Appeals of direct conversions. </T3>(A) Each DoD Component shall establishan administrative appeals procedure to resolve questions from directlyaffected parties regarding decisions to convert directly to contract. Theappeal must address reasons why fair and reasonable prices will not beobtainable. (B) Directly affected parties shall file appeals within 30 calendar daysof the date of CBD and FR notification of a decision to convert a CA directlyto contract. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section applies.(C) The appeals procedure shall be independent and objective and providefor a decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of theappeal. The decision shall be made by an impartial official at a levelorganizationally higher than the official who approved the direct conversiondecision. The appeal decision shall be final, unless the DoD Componentprocedures provide for further discretionary review within the DoD Component.(D) The installation commander shall make available, on request, all detaileddocumentation supporting the initial decision to directly convert to contracta CA being performed by 45 or fewer civilian personnel when announced.If the documentation is not available when the initial decision is announced,the time allotted for submission of appeals shall be extended the numberof days equal to the delay. (iii) Since the appeal procedure is intended to protect the rights of alldirectly affected parties, the DoD Component's procedures, as well as thedecision upon appeal, will not be subject to negotiation, arbitration,or agreement. (iv) DoD Components shall include administrative appeal procedures as partof their implementing guidance. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 169a.6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reporting requirements. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Inventory and Review Schedule (Report Control Symbol DD-Pandamp;L(A)1540). </T3>See andSection; 169a.5(a). (b) <T3>Commercial Activities Management Information System (CAMIS) (ReportControl Symbol DD-Pandamp;L(Q) 1542). </T3>(1) The purpose of CAMIS is tomaintain an accurate DoD data base of CAs that undergo an OMB CircularNo. A-76 cost comparison and CAs that are converted directly to contractThe CAMIS is used to provide information to the Congress, OMB, GeneralAccounting Office (GAO), DoD, and others. The CAMIS is divided into twoparts. Part I contains data on CAs that undergo a full cost comparison.Part II contains data on CAs converted to contract without a full costcomparison. Each DoD Component shall submit an automated data report (tapeor diskett) of all cost comparisons and direct conversions to DMDC no laterthan 30 days following the end of each fiscal quarter, DoD Components mayopt to submit an annotated printout of records in lieu of the automatedsubmission.
