(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government dropped its seditionand racketeering case against three leading militants of the 1970safter three years and more than $2 million in trial costs.   U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said Friday he will not retry the case.Prosecutors claimed the radicals conspired to overthrow thegovernment by force through a series of bombings and bank robberies.   ``Given the amount of effort already expended in theinvestigation and prosecution, and the effort that would be neededfor a new trial, I have decided that the best course is not to seeka retrial,'' he said.   The federal jury cleared the three of sedition charges with apartial verdict Monday, then deadlocked on whether alleged bombingexploits constituted racketeering. A mistrial on the racketeeringcharges was declared Wednesday.   Defendants Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams will not gofree because they are serving 45-year sentences on convictions in aNew York federal court on some of the bombings.   But the third defendant, Patricia Levasseur, has been releasedfrom prison after serving 3{ years of a five-year federal term forharboring a fugitive, her husband Raymond.   ``I am grateful for my new life,'' Mrs. Levasseur said. ``Ithink it was a very reasonable thing that the government is doingby not retrying this case and I want to thank the jury and thecommunity that they come from here for having belief in myinnocence.''   Defense attorneys were delighted.   ``I'm speechless. After 2{ years or whatever it's been on thiscase, it's the right result and I'm a little bit overwhelmed thatthe government did the right thing in this case at this juncture,''said attorney Kenneth King.   Estimates of the trial costs ranged from $2 million to $10million, much of it for the crew of U.S. marshals brought in tomaintain security.   The case began in May 1986 with an indictment against eightpeople on charges of seditious conspiracy, racketeering andracketeering conspiracy. Each count carries a maximum term of 20years and $20,000 in fines.   During the course of the case, charges were dropped against twoof the defendants who were already serving long prison terms. Twoothers pleaded guilty and charges were dropped against a fifthperson after a judge suppressed evidence seized at her house.   By the start of trial in January, only three defendants remained.   Prosecutors claimed the three were members of an undergroundgroup which bombed courthouses and other facilities from 1976 to1984 in a plot to overthrow the U.S. government. They claimed thegroup robbed banks to finance their actions.   But the defense hailed the jury's rejection of the seditiousconspiracy charges as vindication of their argument that theindictment in effect was for ``thought crimes'' and should neverhave been lodged.   The government has used the sedition statute only a few timessince it was first invoked to punish Confederates during the CivilWar, according to Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western NewEngland College in Springfield.   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft duringWorld War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused inan assassination attempt against then President Harry Truman. LastApril, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditiousconspiracy charges in Arkansas.</TEXT></DOC>
