<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0977 </DOCNO><TEXT>Fluid motion in a horizontal channel at very high temperatures is studiedwhen the radiative heat flux is expressible in general differential form.On the assumption that the fluid is chemically reacting while the temperaturesof the channel walls vary linearly with axial distance, the problem isreduced to a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary integro-differential equationswhen only linear terms in the axial distance are retained. An iterativesequence is established in which the eventual linear equations are discretizedby employing finite differences for derivatives and trapazium rule forintegrals. The effect of the chemical rate constant and the radiativeparameters on the flow are discussed. (author). 5 refs, 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
