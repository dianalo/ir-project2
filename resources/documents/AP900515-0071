WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate voted overhwelmingly today to limitdebate and proceed with a bipartisan bill providing $600 million tostates and cities hit hard by AIDS.   The Senate's 95-3 vote to limit debate was necessary to beginconsidering amendments after an opponent, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,erected procedural roadblocks in the way of the bill.   Helms had acknowledged that his lonely objection was futile andthat the Senate would ultimately approve the two-year spendingauthorization.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, responded todayto Helms' assertion that money was being spent on a disease spreadthrough ``immorality.''   Mitchell said the government provides money through Medicare totreat people whose smoking caused lung cancer or heart disease, orwhose reckless driving caused injury _ and should do no less forpeople with AIDS.   ``The Congress doesn't refuse to care for these people becauseit is their behavior which led to the disease,'' Mitchell said.   ``As is the case of smoking and lung cancer, we can do no lessfor those American men, women and children with AIDS,'' he said.``We must act now to provide emergency support to our nation'scities and towns who continue to struggle to meet the overwhelmingneeds of AIDS patients.''   Helms said Monday that the bill was a result of AIDS``hysteria'' and neglects the ``role immorality has played in thiscrisis.''   ``I've never heard once in this chamber anybody say to thehomosexuals, `Stop what you're doing,''' Helms said. ``If theywould stop what they're doing there would not be one additionalcase of AIDS in the United States.''   The only senators joining Helms in voting against the debatelimitation were Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Steven Symms,R-Idaho.   The bill has 65 Senate cosponsors, more than enough for passage,said one of the sponsors, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.   A bipartisan group of supporters described the measure asemergency relief for communities and public health systemsoverburdened by people suffering from AIDS, or acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   ``The time has come to recognize AIDS as a national disasterthat is disproportionately affecting certain areas of thecountry,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``They cannot beexpected to cope with this crisis alone.''   Under the bill, 13 metropolitan areas would qualify for $300million: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Houston; Los Angeles;Miami; New York; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; San Francisco; SanJuan, Puerto Rico; and Washington, D.C.   Those areas have reported 60 percent of the nation's AIDS cases,sponsors said. The money would be used to care for AIDS patientsand to bolster support programs.   Another $300 million would go to states to develop comprehensiveAIDS care programs, especially services to small cities and ruralareas.   Opening debate Monday pitted Helms against a fellow conservativeRepublican, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.   Hatch disputed Helms' assertion that ending homosexual behaviorwould halt the disease, saying the AIDS-causing virus continues tobe transmitted through other means.   ``It is foolish to say it just all comes because of high-riskhomosexual conduct,'' he said.   Hatch said the lifestyles of AIDS sufferers shouldn't matter andcited federal estimates that as many as 1 million to 1.5 millionpeople may be infected with the virus, including as many as 25,000children.   ``Are we going to hold it against these children because theirmothers are (intravenous) drug users?'' Hatch asked.   ``This is a bill to try to alleviate pain and suffering,'' hesaid.   In a speech and an exchange with Hatch on the Senate floor,Helms charged that homosexual activity was to blame for the diseaseand called the bill ``another legislative flagship for the militanthomosexual'' lobby. He said money for research into cancer andother diseases was ``drying up'' while spending increased for AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
