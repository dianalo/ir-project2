The Soviet news agency Tass, meanwhile, said guerrillas launchedanother attack on Jalalabad during the weekend with rockets andartillery, killing 10 people and injuring 16. It said ``considerabledamage was done to the city'' and that the cities of Herat andGardiz also were under fire.   Insurgents, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic Holy Warriors,ambushed three government convoys on Wednesday and Thursday along a40-mile stretch of the road linking Jalalabad and Kabul, the rebelAfghan News Agency said.   The agency said 10 soldiers were killed, including a colonel, and27 were wounded. One officer deserted to the mujahedeen, the agencysaid.   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, head of the news agency, said he did notknow the colonel's identity. There was no independent confirmationof the attack.   The mujahedeen, backed principally by Pakistan and the UnitedStates, have besieged Jalalabad since March 6, three weeks afterSoviet troops ended nine years of intervention on behalf of thecommunist regime.   The guerrillas have rendered the communist-held airport unsafebut supplies have been dropped by air to government forces. A fewarmored convoys have fought their way through from the west.   The guerrilla news agency said 51 communist soldiers have diedand 54 have been wounded in fighting around Afghanistan since June 7.   The Tass report said that the Afghan air force attacked enemypositions outside Jalalabad, killing 270 guerrillas. It claimed 12were Pakistani military personnel.   The Soviet Union has accused Pakistan of aiding the rebels andviolating the accord that resulted in the withdrawal of Soviettroops from the country. Pakistan has denied that its troops haveaided the guerrillas.   Meanwhile, two of the most powerful mujahedeen groups, theJamiat-i-Islami of Burhanuddin Rabbani and the Hezb-i-Islami ofGulbaddin Hekmatyar, both based in Pakistan, denied claims by theKabul government that guerrilla commanders approached the communistsfor a truce.   ``The regime's claims that the mujahedeen commanders havecontacted them is based on fabrication and falsehood ... ,'' theysaid in a joint statement.   They said it was a ploy by Afghan President Najib to sow discordamong rebel groups.   ``The writing on the wall is clear _ the puppet regime's days arenumbered,'' the statement said.   Guerrilla leaders predicted the ruling People's Democratic Partyof Afghanistan would fall quickly after the Soviet troop withdrawal.But Najib has cited his forces' tenacious defense of Jalalabad asproof that his government has the power to survive.   He has offered repeated deals to the rebels to end the fightingand recently launched a propaganda campaign indicating theinsurgents were pressing for peace.   But guerrilla leaders, who want to establish an Islamic republicin Afghanistan, have rejected overtures from Kabul.   Afghanistan's ruling party seized power in a 1978 military coup,sparking the Moslem insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
