Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional Democrats' effort to boost the minimum wage for the first time in seven years died, the victim of a Republican filibuster in the Senate.    The failure of the measure deals yet another blow to organized labor's legislative agenda in this Democratically controlled Congress. However, Democrats hope it will give them an issue to use against Republicans in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign.    Conceding that Democrats wouldn't soon be able to muster the 60 votes needed to shut off the Republicans' delaying tactics, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) yesterday pulled the bill from consideration. With lawmakers eager to get home in order to campaign for the elections only six weeks away, the move dooms the bill's prospects for this year.    &quot;There is no point in continuing to pound on their door,&quot; Mr. Byrd said of the Senate Republicans. &quot;Simple economic justice will be delayed for millions of workers on the bottom rung of the economic ladder.&quot;    Republicans argued that they weren't given an opportunity to put their own imprint on the bill. &quot;It's not an opposition to an increase in the minimum wage,&quot; said Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas. &quot;It's an opposition to taking it or leaving it.&quot;    The Senate spent five days on the bill, but Republicans blocked any progress, twice rebuffed Democrats' attempts to limit debate, and were prepared to offer as many as 160 amendments in order to bog down the measure.    Many Senate Republicans complained that the controlling Democrats were using the final days of the session to boost their election-year agenda at the expense of legislation sought by Republicans. Mr. Dole said the entire question of raising the minimum wage should be part of the presidential campaign.    &quot;None of these issues is so urgent that it shouldn't be part of the national debate,&quot; he said, noting that the issue wasn't raised during Sunday night's debate between Vice President George Bush, the GOP nominee, and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis. &quot;We'll have plenty time to talk about them next year,&quot; Mr. Dole said.    The bill would have raised the federally mandated minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 an hour over three years.    In the campaigns' closing weeks, Republicans and Democrats can be expected to trade charges over who is responsible for the bill's failure. Senate Republicans are blaming the Democrats' adamant opposition to a &quot;training wage.&quot; As proposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), that wage would have been set at 80% of the minimum wage and would have been paid for 90 days to new entrants into the work force.    Republicans said this lower wage, which has been pushed by the Reagan administration and business groups, was necessary to encourage companies to hire inexperienced workers. Democrats complained that the training wage would allow employers to hire a worker for three months, then replace that person with a new employee for another three months.    Senate Democrats noted that while President Reagan, Mr. Bush and Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee, have all said they favor an unspecified increase in the minimum wage, they did nothing to bring the filibuster to an end. &quot;Perhaps it is not enough that the vice president. . .has called for an increase in the minimum wage,&quot; Sen. Byrd said.    &quot;Effectively the Republicans have said, 'We're opposed to a living wage for working Americans,'&quot; declared the bill's sponsor, Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.).    The bill's failure is another setback for organized labor's legislative efforts. When the Democrats regained control of the Senate last year, labor unveiled an ambitious agenda of legislation. But with only a few weeks left in the current congressional session, little of it has become law.    After the minimum-wage bill was taken down, the Senate turned to another item on labor's list -- and another likely target of a Republican filibuster: a measure that would mandate that employers give unpaid leave to workers to care for newborn infants and sick children.    As the Senate began considering the parental leave measure, Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D., Conn.), the bill's chief sponsor, indicated that a revised version will be offered that would exempt 95% of all U.S. employers. The 5% of employers the legislation would cover, primarily big businesses, is down from the 12% it is currently estimated to cover.    The weakened measure would effectively eliminate small business, which had been a potent critic of the bill. But some small business officials remained opposed, saying the bill represents &quot;a foot in the door&quot; that could expand in the future. </TEXT></DOC>
