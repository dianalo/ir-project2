The company is among a score of Western and Japaneseconcerns that have made proposals or are considering them.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the recent political turmoil there, Mobil said ithas a team currently in the Soviet Union talking withrepresentatives of the island, the Russian republic and thecentral government. &quot;We are fully expecting to pursue withall vigor oil and gas opportunities&quot; in the region, a Mobilspokesman said.   The company, based in Fairfax, Va., said it submitted a250-page proposal Aug. 10 to develop two areas offshoreSakhalin Island, which is located north of Japan, in theeastern part of the Russian Republic. It was over that islandthat a Soviet jet fighter shot down a Korean Air Linespassenger plane, killing all 269 people aboard in September1983. The proposal was in response to a June invitation bySoviet and local authorities.   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer andis believed to hold vast, untapped reserves. But output hasbeen sagging because of aging fields and outdated equipmentand techniques. Salomon Brothers Inc. estimates thatproduction will fall to 10.5 million barrels a day this yearfrom 12.5 million barrels a day in 1988. The Soviets had beendesperately looking for Western help to stem the decline, andmany companies have expressed increasing interest inopportunities there.   &quot;Prior to the coup attempt if you said what part of theworld are companies most excited about from a geologicalpoint of view, the answer was the Soviet Union,&quot; said DanielYergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.&quot;In the aftermath it's still the same region even if thecountry doesn't have the same name.&quot;   Mr. Yergin said that after several years of study, Westerncompanies find the geological prospects even better thanexpected. &quot;The politics they find baffling,&quot; he said. Mr.Yergin believes, however, that current events point toreduced barriers of entry, though it will still be a slow,difficult process.   In Paris a spokesman for Societe Nationale Elf Aquitainesaid the company would proceed with a project to develop oilin both Russia and Kazakhstan. &quot;We haven't changed any plansfor our projects,&quot; he said.   Exxon Corp., based in Irving, Texas, said it submitted aproposal for the development of Sakhalin on Aug. 18 with aJapanese group that included Japan National Oil Co., OverseasPetroleum Corp., Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. and C. Itohandamp; Co.   In Chicago, a spokesman for Amoco Corp. said the companyalso bid to develop Sakhalin Island's oil reserves in apartnership with BHP Petroleum Co. and Hyundai HeavyIndustries.   The Mobil spokesman said the company has been visiting theSoviet Union since 1989, with a strategy of dealing with asmany levels of government as it could. &quot;We understood societywas in transitionthat was quite apparent or we wouldn't bethere,&quot; he said.   Mobil's development plan, if approved, would require manypartners as well as financing that hasn't yet been discussed.Oil officials in Sakhalin have estimated that the islandcontains 1.46 billion barrels of oil reserves and 17.65trillion cubic feet of gas.   Mobil's proposal is for the development of two fields inthe Sea of Okhotsk. The bidders expect to learn in October adecision on the proposals, which will probably lead tofurther negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
