This pivoting movement of the      upper shaft part (16) when the ski boot is closed is transmitted to      transmission members (86), which are displaceable in the longitudinal      direction of the boot, by means of actuating levers (82). The movement of      the transmission members (86) toward a heel element (98) is converted into      a pushing forward of a tensioning member (90) by means of toothed wheels      (94). Thereupon, the effective part loops (106,108) of the tensioning      element (102), which are guided around the tensioning member (90), are      shortened. When the upper shaft part (16) is in the rest position, the      foot is consequently retained by the retaining element (96) and the heel      cap (100). When the upper shaft part (16) is pivoted back into the      standing position, the foot is free inside the ski boot. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a ski boot provided with a sole and a      shaft, a lower shaft part enclosing the foot, a front shaft part      surrounding the lower tibia area, and a rear shaft part provided in the      area of the heel and the lower fibula pivotable about an axis which runs      approximately parallel to the sole and transversely to a longitudinal      direction of the boot. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  A ski boot of this type is known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No.      4,160,332. This boot has a lower shaft part which surrounds the foot and      on which a front shaft part, which surrounds the lower tibia area, is      formed in one piece. A rear shaft part, which is provided in the heel and      lower fibula area, is pivotably articulated on the lower shaft part in the      area of the ankle about an axis which runs parallel to the sole and at      right angles to the longitudinal direction of the boot. Inside the ski      boot, a foot retaining element is provided with a band-shaped tensioning      element which runs over the instep. The latter element is connected to a      tensioning cable which is guided through under the articulation of the      rear shaft part on the lower shaft part and which is suspended      alternatively on one of a number of teeth on the rear shaft part which are      arranged above one another. To open the ski boot, the rear shaft part is      pivoted backwards, as a result of which the tensioning cable, and      consequently the foot retaining element, is released. Upon closing the ski      boot, the rear shaft part is pivoted in a forward direction, the      tensioning cable being tensioned and the foot retaining element      consequently being pulled in a direction towards the heel as a result of      this pivoting movement. With the ski boot closed, the foot retaining      element is consequently always tensioned and a release of the foot      retaining element is only possible by means of opening the ski boot. An      open ski boot, however, is extremely undesirable for traveling by means of      a lift or when walking. In order to make possible a relaxation of the foot      with the ski boot closed, the ski boot must be opened and the tensioning      cable released from the relevant tooth and suspended on a tooth arranged      lower down. Subsequently, the ski boot is to be closed again by means of      forward pivoting of the rear shaft part, as a result of which the foot      retaining element is then less tensioned. In a similar manner, for the      next descent, the foot retaining element is then to be tensioned more      strongly again by means of renewed suspension of the tensioning cable on a      tooth arranged higher up. This procedure is extremely elaborate and      complicated. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a ski boot of      the generic type, which, with the ski boot closed, permits the foot      retaining element to be tensioned and released. </PAR><PAR>  This aim is achieved by means of a foot retaining device arranged inside      the ski boot and being connected to a tensioning device which can be      activated by means of pivoting of the rear shaft part. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, with the ski boot closed, the front and rear      shaft part can be pivoted jointly from a standing position, which runs      approximately perpendicularly to the sole, into a rest position which is      inclined forwards. Upon the joint pivoting movement of the front and rear      shaft part into the rest position, the foot retaining element is      tensioned. The rest position corresponds in this connection to the usual      position of the front and rear shaft part upon descent. To open the ski      boot, the front and rear shaft parts are consequently pivoted back into      the standing position and, after the ski boot has been put on and closed,      these two shaft parts are pivoted jointly forward into the rest position      for the descent, which at the same time leads to a tensioning of the foot      retaining element. The present invention consequently allows standing      upright without the lower leg being held in a position which is inclined      forward. At the same time, the foot retaining element is also released,      which makes possible a relaxation of the foot with the ski boot closed. As      the front and rear shaft part can be pivoted backwards and forwards      between the standing position and the rest position with the boot closed,      problem-free walking is moreover possible with the ski boot according to      the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  A more complete understanding of the invention can be made by reference to      the accompanying drawings, wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 1 to 3 show in a perspective representation a ski boot with a catch      device for the releasable holding of the upper shaft part in a rest      position which is inclined forward; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows, likewise in a perspective representation, a tensioning device      for tensioning a foot retaining element which is arranged inside the ski      boot which is represented in a transparent manner; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows a part of the tensioning device in an exploded representation;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6 to 9 show in a top view and elevation view respectively the      tensioning device in two different positions. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The shaft 10, which is made of, for example, synthetic material, of the ski      boot represented in FIGS. 1 to 3, has a lower shaft part 12, with a sole      14 formed thereon, which surrounds the foot. On the lower shaft part 12,      in the area of the ankle, an upper shaft part 16 is pivotably articulated      about an axis 20, which runs essentially parallel to the sole 14 and at      right angles to the longitudinal direction A of the boot, by means of      schematically indicated joints 18, of which only one is visible in the      figures. The upper shaft part 16 has a front shaft part 22, which encloses      the lower tibia area, and a rear shaft part 24 which encloses the heel and      lower fibula area. These two shaft parts 22 and 24 are mounted on the      joints 18 and, by means of a known, schematically indicated closure 26,      can be tensioned against one another in order to surround the lower leg      area of the skier. To open the ski boot, the closure 26 is opened and the      rear shaft part 24 is pivoted backwards about the axis 20. </PAR><PAR>  In FIGS. 1 and 3, the upper shaft part 16 is presented pivoted into a rest      position which, in relation to a perpendicular 28 to the sole 14, is      inclined in a forward direction about the axis 20 in arrow direction B.      The rest position corresponds to the usual position when skiing. In FIG.      2, this rest position is indicated in broken lines and designated as 16.      In solid lines, the upper shaft part is represented in its standing      position which is indicated by 16, and in which it is pivoted out of the      rest position 16 in a direction towards the perpendicular 28 counter to      arrow direction B. </PAR><PAR>  In the instep area, a retaining device 30 with a catch device 23 is      provided for the releasable retention of the upper shaft part 16 in its      forwardly inclined rest position. The catch device 32 has a slide 34 which      is displaceably mounted on the lower shaft part 12 approximately in the      longitudinal direction A of the boot. The slide 34 is displaceably mounted      in the lower shaft part 12, by means of a dovetail or keyway guide, for      example. In the rear end area, seen in the longitudinal direction A of the      boot, the slide 34 has an upwardly projecting nose 36 with a stop surface      38. A catch tongue 40, which projects into the area of the slide 34, is      formed on the front shaft part 22. This tongue has a passage 42 which is      rectangular in cross-section and the front limit of which, seen in the      longitudinal direction A of the boot, forms a counterstop surface 44. In      the central area of the slide 34, a fork-shaped double-armed lever 46 is      pivotably mounted thereon about an axis 46' which runs parallel to the      sole 14 and at right angles to the longitudinal direction A of the boot.      The lever arms 48, which run alongside the slide 34 and are directed      backwards from the axis 46', engage with their free end areas under the      catch tongue 40. The lever arms 50, which in relation to the axis 46'      project forward in the longitudinal direction A of the boot, are connected      to one another by means of a plate-shaped connecting part 52 which is      arranged above and approximately parallel to the slide 34. Between the      connecting part 52 and the slide 34, a pressure spring 54 is provided,      which holds the double-armed lever 46 in a counter-clockwise direction in      the position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In FIG. 1, the counterstop surface 44      of the catch tongue 40 bears against the stop surface 38 of the nose 36,      as a result of which the upper shaft part 16 is held in its rest position      which is inclined in a forward direction. In FIG. 2, the stop and      counterstop surfaces 38, 44 have been brought out of overlap and the catch      tongue 40 lies with its connecting web 56, which is provided on the front      end area and limits the passage 42 towards the front, on a sliding surface      36' of the nose 36. </PAR><PAR>  The slide 34 is adjustably retained in its position in relation to the      longitudinal direction A of the boot by means of a spindle drive 58. In      the toe area, the lower shaft part 12 has two upwardly projecting bearing      bosses 60, 60', on which a spindle 62 of the spindle drive 58 is mounted      in a freely rotatable but, seen in the longitudinal direction A of the      boot, stationary manner. The axis of rotation of the spindle 62 runs in      the central longitudinal plane of the boot and essentially parallel to the      surface of the lower shaft part 12. In the area which projects in a      backward direction from the rear bearing boss 60, the spindle 62 has a      thread (not shown in the Figures), in which the slide 34 runs as a running      nut. In the area between the two bearing bosses 60, 60', the spindle 62 is      designed as a thickened operating roller 64. </PAR><PAR>  Laterally below the catch tongue 40, two pressure spring elements 66 are      provided, which rest at one end on the lower and at the other end on the      front shaft part 12, 22 (FIGS. 1 and 2). As shown in FIG. 3, the retaining      device 30 with the catch device 32 according to FIGS. 1 and 2 is covered      by a shell-shaped cover element 68 in order to prevent the penetration of      snow and ice. The cover element 68 has recesses on its upper side for the      connecting part 52 and the operating roller 64. The cover element 68      extends from the toe area as far as the area of the nose 36 and catch      tongue 40. Between the cover element 68 and the front shaft part 22, an      elastic bellows 74 is provided, which covers the pressure spring elements      66 and the catch tongue 40 and permits a relative displacement between the      cover element 68 and the front shaft part 22. </PAR><PAR>  For skiing, the upper shaft part 16 is pivoted forward in arrow direction B      into the rest position shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, in which the counterstop      surface 44 bears against the stop surface 38. The rest position 16      consequently corresponds to the usual skiing position. A further forward      pivoting, in arrow direction B in relation to the rest position 16, of the      upper shaft part 16 by means of forward bending of the lower leg against      the force of the pressure spring elements 66, is made possible by the      catch device 32. In this connection, the stop and counterstop surfaces 38,      44 lift off from one another and the connecting web 56, as a result of the      pretension of the catch tongue 40, slides on the slide 34 in a direction      towards the sole 14, in the area between the nose 36 and the axis 46'. A      return pivoting counter to arrow direction B beyond the rest position 16      is prevented, however, by the nose 36 and the connecting web 56. </PAR><PAR>  In order to remove the ski boot, for standing upright, traveling by means      of the lift or walking, pressure is then applied to the connecting part 52      by means of the ski pole. Thereupon, the double-armed lever 46 pivots in a      clockwise direction against the force of the pressure springs 54 and the      lever arms 48 raise the front area of the catch tongue 40, against its      pretension in the engagement direction, over the nose 36. In this      connection, the stop and counterstop surfaces 38, 44 come out of      engagement and the upper shaft part 16 can then be pivoted counter to      arrow direction B out of the rest position. Upon the lifting off of the      ski pole from the connecting part 52, the double-armed lever 46 pivots in      an anti-clockwise direction back into the position shown in the figures,      as a result of which the connecting web 56 then comes to lie on the nose      36 (cf. FIG. 2). With the catch device 32 released, standing upright and      comfortable putting on and removing of the ski boot is consequently      possible. Furthermore, when walking, pivoting of the upper shaft part 16      in and counter to arrow direction B between the standing position 16' and      the rest position 16 is possible, the connecting web 56 sliding on the      sliding surface 36'. Comfortable walking is consequently possible with the      ski boot closed. For skiing, the upper shaft part 16 is pivoted into the      rest position 16 by means of forward bending of the lower leg in arrow      direction B. Thereupon, the connecting web 56 runs off of the catch nose      36, as a result of which, because of the pretension of the catch tongue 40      in the engagement direction, the counterstop surface 44 comes into      engagement with the stop surface 38 (FIG. 1). The upper shaft part 16 is      then held in the rest position for skiing. </PAR><PAR>  By means of rotating the spindle 62, the position of the slide 34 can be      modified approximately in the longitudinal direction (A) of the boot, that      is to say in the direction of the relative movement between the catch      tongue 40 and the slide 34 upon pivoting of the upper shaft part 16. As a      result of this, the desired rest position for the descent can be adjusted. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 4, the ski boot shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 is simplified and represented      as if assumed to be transparent. For the sake of greater clarity, the      retaining device 30 with the catch device 32 is not shown in this FIG. 4.      On the lower shaft part 12 with the sole 14, in the area of the ankle, the      upper shaft part 16 is pivotably articulated with the front shaft part 22      and the rear shaft part 24 about the axis 20. Inside the ski boot, a      tensioning device 76 for a foot retaining device 78 is provided. </PAR><PAR>  The joints 18 each have a pivot pin 80 which is mounted freely rotatably in      the lower shaft part 12 and which is connected in a rotationally fixed      manner on the one hand to the front shaft part 22 and on the other to a      one-armed actuating lever 82 which is provided inside the ski boot and      projects in a direction towards the sole 14 from the pivot pin 80. On the      two pivot pins 80, the rear shaft part 24 is also pivotably mounted. The      two actuating levers 82 are connected to one another at their free ends by      means of a cylindrical shaft 84, the longitudinal axis of which runs      parallel to the axis 20. </PAR><PAR>  In the area of the sole 14, two profiled transmission members 86, which are      at a distance from one another in the direction of the shaft 84, are      mounted displaceably in the longitudinal direction A of the boot. Seen in      the longitudinal direction A of the boot, the two transmission members 86      each have in their central area a groove 88 which is upwardly open and      runs at right angles to the longitudinal direction A of the boot. The      shaft 84 runs through the groove 88, the width of the groove 88 only      slightly exceeding the diameter of the shaft 84. </PAR><PAR>  Between the two transmission members 86, a slide-shaped tensioning member      90 is arranged, which is slidingly guided in the longitudinal direction A      of the boot likewise. On the sides which face one another, the two      transmission members 86 and the tensioning member 90 have rack-shaped      toothings 92 which run in the longitudinal direction A of the boot and      which engage with two toothed wheels 94 which are provided between the      tensioning member 90 and the transmission members 86. The toothed wheels      94 are mounted rotatably (cf. FIG. 5) about axes of rotation 94', which      run at right angles to the sole 14, on pins which are not shown. The pins      can be arranged on the sole 14, on an inner sole, which is not shown but      generally known, or on a bearing part for the tensioning device 76. The      toothings 92 and toothed wheels 94 bring about a reversal of the direction      of movement of the tensioning member 90 in relation to the transmission      members 86. When the transmission members 86 are displaced backwards in      the longitudinal direction A of the boot, the tensioning member 90 is      moved forward in the longitudinal direction A of the boot and vice-versa. </PAR><PAR>  The foot retaining device 78 is designed in the same manner as is described      in full in EP-A 0 321 714 and in the corresponding U.S. Pat. No.      4,922,634. This foot retaining device 78 has a retaining element 96,      arranged between the shaft 10 and a generally known padded inner boot (not      shown in the Figures), is indicated in broken lines and covers the foot in      the instep and tibia area in the form of a saddle, and a heel cap 100      which is pivotably articulated in the heel area on a heel element 98. A      cable-shaped tensioning element 102 connects the retaining element 96 and      the heel cap 100 to the tensioning device 76. The tensioning member 90 has      two guide grooves 104 for the tensioning element 102 (cf. FIG. 5 also).      The two guide grooves 104 run parallel to one another and, seen in a      direction parallel to the sole 14 and at right angles to the longitudinal      direction A of the boot, next to one another forward in the longitudinal      direction A of the boot from the upper rear end of the tensioning member      90, around the rounded front end of the tensioning member 90 to the      underside which faces the sole 14 and, on this side, back to the rear end      of the tensioning member 90, around the rounded front end of the      tensioning member 90 to the underside which faces the sole 14 and, on this      side, back to the rear end of the tensioning member 90. The cable-shaped      tensioning element 102, which forms an endless loop, is guided around the      tensioning member 90 once, coming from the heel element 98, in each guide      groove 104 and is divided into two part loops 106 and 108 by this member. </PAR><PAR>  In the front part loop 106, the tensioning element 102, starting from one      guide groove 104 on the upper side of the tensioning member 90, runs from      the latter to the heel element 98 and in this, in a guide channel 110 or      around a corresponding deflection roller, is deflected in an outward      direction by approximately 180.degree.. Subsequently, the tensioning      element 102 crosses the retaining element 96 in the instep area and is      guided from there to a deflection eye 112 which is provided on the sole      14. Coming from the deflection eye 112, the tensioning element 102 crosses      the retaining element 96 in the front end area and is guided to a further      deflection eye 112 which, in relation to the central longitudinal plane of      the boot, is symmetrical to the deflection eye 112, and from which further      deflection eye 112 of the tensioning element 102 again runs over the      retaining element 96 in the instep area to the other side of the ski boot      and backwards to the heel element 98, where it is again deflected by      approximately 180.degree. in a guide channel 110 and is conducted to the      other guide groove 104 in the tensioning member 90. </PAR><PAR>  In the rear part loop 108, the cable-shaped tensioning element 102,      starting from a guide groove 104 on the underside of the tensioning member      90, runs backward to the heel element 98, where it is guided in a further      guide channel 114 to its rear end. From there, the tensioning element 102      runs around the heel cap 100 to the other side of the ski boot, where it      is guided by means of a guide projection 116 which is formed on the heel      cap 100. Coming from there, the tensioning element 102 crosses the      retaining element 96 in its upper end area and runs to a corresponding      guide projection 116 on the heel cap 100 on the other side of the ski      boot. From there, the tensioning element 102 is guided around the heel cap      100 to the other side of the ski boot, from where it is guided, in a      further guide channel 114, to the other guide groove 104. 118 indicates an      adjustment element which is arranged on one side of the ski boot above the      corresponding joint 18 and by means of which the length of the endless      loop of the tensioning element 102 can be adjusted. On the heel element      98, two damping springs 120 are arranged, against which the transmission      members 86 run up upon moving in a direction toward the heel element 98. </PAR><PAR>  In FIGS. 6 to 9, the tensioning device 76 is represented in a simplified      manner in a top view and elevation view respectively In FIGS. 6 and 8,      seen in the longitudinal direction A of the boot, the tensioning member 90      is in its backward release position and in FIGS. 7 and 9, seen in the      longitudinal direction A of the boot, it is shown in its forward      tensioning position 90'. The shaft 84, which connects the two actuating      levers 82 to one another, passes through the two transmission members 86      in the grooves 88. The pivoting movement of the actuating levers 82 about      the axis 20 and the movement connected to it of the transmission members      86 is converted into an opposing movement of the tensioning member 90 by      means of the toothed wheels 94 and the toothings 92 on the transmission      members 86 and on the tensioning member 90. If the actuating levers 82 are      in the pivoting position shown in FIGS. 6 and 8 with the longitudinal      extension of the actuating lever 82 running forward at an angle, then the      tensioning member 90 is displaced backwards into the release position. If,      on the other hand, the actuating levers 82 are pivoted into the position      shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, in which the longitudinal extension of the      actuating levers 82 runs in a backward direction at an angle, the      tensioning member 90 is in its forward tensioning position 90'. The guide      grooves for the cable-shaped tensioning element 102 in the tensioning      member 90 are indicated by 104. In the heel element 98, only the further      guide channels 114 for the tensioning element 102 of the rear part loop      108 are indicated in broken lines (cf. FIG. 4). The damping springs 120      are held with their rear end area in blind holes 122 in the heel element      98. The front part area of each damping spring 120 projects forward in the      longitudinal direction A of the boot beyond the heel element 98. Upon the      displacement of the transmission members 86 out of their forward position      shown in FIGS. 6 and 8 into the backward position represented in FIGS. 7      and 9, these each run up against a damping spring 120 after approximately      half the displacement path. These damping springs 120 replace or      complement the pressure spring elements 66 according to FIGS. 1 and 2. </PAR><PAR>  In FIGS. 6 to 9, the lower shaft part 12 and the sole 14 are only      schematically indicated. 124 indicates the foot bed which covers the      tensioning device 76. </PAR><PAR>  Upon displacing the tensioning member 90 into the tensioning position 90',      the effective loop lengths of the two part loops 106 and 108 are shortened      and the tensioning element 102 tensioned. Thereupon, the retaining element      96 is pulled by the front part loop 106 in a direction towards the sole 14      and by the rear part loop 108 in a direction towards the heel. At the same      time, the heel cap 100 is pivoted in a forward direction. This provides      the skier with secure retention in the ski boot. If, on the other hand,      the tensioning member 90 is transferred into the release position shown in      FIGS. 6 and 8, the effective loop lengths of the two part loops 106 and      108 are increased, as a result of which the tensioning element 102 is      freed and the retaining element 96 as well as the heel cap 100 is      released. </PAR><PAR>  In order to put the ski boot on, the catch device 32 (cf. FIGS. 1 to 3) is      disengaged and the upper shaft part 16 is pivoted out of the rest      position, which is inclined forward in relation to the perpendicular 28 to      the sole 14, counter to arrow direction B into the standing position 16'.      This pivoting movement of the upper shaft part 16 is transmitted to the      actuating levers 82 by means of the pivot pins 80. These levers are      consequently pivoted into the position shown in FIGS. 6 and 8 which      results in a displacement of the tensioning member 90 into the backward      release position. The closure 26 is then opened and the rear shaft part 24      is pivoted backwards about the pivot pins 80. After the ski boot has been      put on, the rear shaft part 24 is closed again and secured to the front      shaft part 22 by means of the closure 26. In this connection, the      tensioning member 90 remains in its release position and the foot can move      relatively freely inside the ski boot. For the descent, the lower leg is      then bent forwards, as a result of which the upper shaft part 16, that is      to say the front shaft part 22 together with the rear shaft part 24, is      pivoted forward in arrow direction B. As soon as the rest position 16 is      reached, the catch tongue 40 engages on the nose 36. This pivoting      movement of the upper shaft part 16 then results in the actuating levers      being pivoted into the position shown in FIGS. 7 and 9. The tensioning      member 90 is thus transferred forward in the longitudinal direction A of      the boot into the tensioning position 90', which then results in the      effective loop lengths of the two part loops 106, 108 being shortened and      the tensioning element 102 being tensioned. By these means, the foot of      the skier is securely retained in the ski boot. After the descent, the      catch device 32 is released by means of pressure on the connecting part 52      of the double-armed lever 46. The upper shaft part 16 can thus be pivoted      out of the rest position in to the standing position shown in FIG. 2 by      16'. This pivoting movement then results in the tensioning member 90 then      being transferred into the release position shown in FIGS. 8 and 10. The      retaining element 96 and the heel cap 100 are freed, as a result of which      the foot can move relatively freely again inside the boot and relax.      Moreover, problem-free walking is made possible with the ski boot. Upon      the respective forward bending of the lower leg, the foot, according to      the forward lean of the lower leg, is surrounded more firmly by the      retaining element 96 and the heel cap 100 or the surrounding action is      relaxed again. With the upper shaft part 16 in the standing position 16',      and the tensioning element 102 thus automatically released, the ski boot      can be put on or taken off easily when the rear shaft part 24 is folded      back </PAR><PAR>  It is quite conceivable that a ski boot has a catch device according to      FIGS. 1 to 3, in order to make possible a pivoting of the upper shaft part      into the standing position, without the tensioning device for the foot      retaining device being connected to this pivoting movement. It is of      course also conceivable, to design a front-entry ski boot with a catch      device. Advantageously, the latter is in this case arranged between the      lower shaft part and the rear shaft part. For such a ski boot, the      tensioning device for the foot retaining device can correspondingly be      connected to the rear shaft part. </PAR><PAR>  The catch device for the releasable holding of the upper shaft part in the      rest position which is pivoted forward can also be designed other than      shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. It is thus conceivable to arrange the catch nose      on a catch lever mounted pivotably on the slide. By means of pivoting the      catch lever, the catch nose is pulled out of engagement with the passage      in the catch tongue. The catch lever is pretensioned in such a manner that      it automatically engages again as soon as the upper shaft part 16 is      pivoted into the rest position. </PAR><PAR>  With the ski boot according to FIGS. 1 to 3, the rest position of the upper      shaft part 16 can be adjusted in relation to the perpendicular 28 by means      of rotation of the spindle 62. If such an adjustment is not desired, the      catch nose can be formed rigidly on the lower shaft part and the lever      mounted pivotably on the lower shaft part. </PAR><PAR>  It is also possible that the tensioning device has its own releasable      retaining device which is independent of the pivoting position of the      upper shaft part. Thus, for example, a retaining lever can be provided,      which is mounted pivotably on the heel element and which, when the      tensioning member is in a tensioning position, prevents this tensioning      member receding in a backward direction, even when the catch device for      the upper shaft part is released. The tensioning member can then be freed      by means of pivoting of the retaining lever from outside. In this case,      the upper shaft part is only connected to the tensioning device via an      entrainment device which is effective upon the forward pivoting of the      upper shaft part. Such an embodiment is particularly suitable for skiing      with a snow-board. The foot is securely retained in the lower shaft part      by means of the foot retaining device, while the upper shaft part remains      pivotable in relation to the lower shaft part. </PAR><PAR>  It is of course also possible to mount the front and the rear shaft part on      joints on the lower shaft part which are independent of one another. The      foot retaining device can also be designed otherwise than is shown in FIG.      4. </PAR><PAR>  While the invention has been described with reference to particular      preferred embodiments, the invention is not limited to the specific      examples given, and other embodiments and modifications can be made by      those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of      the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
