(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Navy experts were examining radiotelemetry data today in an effort to learn why a Trident 2submarine missile went off course and had to be destroyed 60seconds after it lifted off on a test flight.   The failure was only the second for the Trident 2 in 13 testlaunchings from a land pad here. The weapon, able to carry 10nuclear warheads, will be the most powerful in the Navy's arsenalwhen it becomes operational late next year.   The $23.7 million three-stage missile vaulted skyward Thursdayevening and darted quickly into a heavy cloud layer.   The Navy reported 20 minutes after liftoff that there had been amalfunction. A statement later said the Trident 2 had developed aproblem during first stage flight and that the range safety officersent a radio signal that ignited explosive packages in the missile.   Debris from the shattered rocket fell harmlessly into the oceanseveral miles down the Atlantic tracking range to the southeast ofhere.   The Navy said the cause of the problem could not be determinedimmediately and that an investigation was underway.   The 44-foot Trident 2 was to have hurled a dummy warhead packageto an ocean target several thousand miles to the southeast. Theweapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles, but the intended rangeThursday night was not disclosed.   The test was the 13th of 20 land-pad launches planned here, tobe followed by at least five submarine firings. The missile isscheduled to become operational late in 1989 and will be deployedinitially aboard the new submarine USS Tennessee, the first of nineTrident subs planned by the Navy.   Each submarine will hold 24 Trident 2s, each of which will beable to deliver up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.   The Trident 2 test launch program began here in January 1987 andlogged nine straight successes before suffering its first failurelast January. Two more successes followed prior to Thursday night'sfailure.</TEXT></DOC>
