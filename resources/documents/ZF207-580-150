Or do I merely shrug in the general direction of mymuse and decide that what I have already typed will do? (Muses treated inthis offhand way have been known to take extended vacations.)andM;So what, you might well ask, is all this in aid of? Well, I'll tell you what- just after I go fix a couple of sentences up there at the to .andM;No matter what you do for a living, if you use a computer, yourword-processing program is - if not your life's blood one of the two or threemost important and most frequently used applications you have.andP;  Softwarepublishers recognize this; hence the new iterations of Microsoft Word andWriteNow, upgrades, and th&quot;hybrid&quot; programs such as Nisus and FullWriteProfessional.andP;  Word processors are big business: More than 280,000 unitsshipped in the Macintosh segment of that market in 1988.andP;  (For comparison'ssake, more than 380,000 graphics-software units and about 140,000 spreadsheetpackages shipped in the same period.andP;  And those are all the hard,quantitative facts you're going to get from me on this go-round.)andM;While Microsoft is a clear leader in the word-processing market (with a56-percent share of the pie) as well as in the spreadsheet arena (84percent), word processing is a more fluid and varied arena; there are morecompanies and products that can reasonably be designated as major players.andO;Once you've set up an Excel spreadsheet and worked in it for a while, itwould all but take an act of God to persuade you to try some new, evenpossibly improved product, especially one that had no direct Excel-importfeature.andP;  But people who do a lot of any kind of writing are always on thelookout for new and improved word-processing packages.andP;  While there are justso many acceptable ways to keep track of numbers, there are manyidiosyncratic and deeply personal ways of stringing words together.andP;  Wordprocessors are a clear case of one man's meat being another man's poison;there is no word processor so obscure that it doesn't have ardent adherentsand none so popular than it doesn't have detractors.andM;We don't want much, you understand; we just want the absolutely perfectword-processing program for what we have to do.andP;  go in the interest ofspurring the industry on to greater heights of creativity and bringing closerthe day of the bugless, featureperfect word processor, here's what perfectionmeans to me.andM;But before we slip into the Platonic realm of ideals, there's a classicdichotomy to be reckoned with: The Ideal versus The Get Real.andP;  In the Idealarea, what I really want is a DWIM (Do What I Mean) application - preferablyone with a cultured Jeeves-like voice.andP;  When I write something such as thefirst sentence in this paragraph, it would say, &quot;Pardon me, madam, but I dofeel that the vacuous jargon of the professional philosopher is inappropriatein this context.&quot; It would clean up my quotations and references, evensubstituting more pointed examples; it would replace my common orgarden-variety mot with le mot juste.andP;  It would, in short, not only read mymind, but it would read only the good parts.andP;  So much for science fiction.andM;I could settle for much less.andP;  My first word processor ran on the originalCommodore 64 (presently residing in my closet and making up part of the vastinstalled Commodore user base).andP;  Compared with any Macintosh word processor,it was just barely better than a typewriter.andP;  It was to the original MacWritewhat hand copied manuscripts were to the Gutenberg press.andP;  It did, howeverhave at least one feature I'd like to see in a Mac word processor.andP;  What ithad - and I realize the risk I'm running here - was three intelligentlyplanned function keys: On took you immediately (and without scrolling) to thetop of the document, one took you to the bottom, and one went straight to thelast active cursor position.andP;  If you've ever edited on-screen, you mayappreciate these features.andM;In my present life, I use Word.andP;  This is not the result of endless comparisonof products nor the culmination of a search for my personal favorite.andP;  It'sthe style sheets.andP;  MacUser is desktop-published in PageMaker, and those stylesheets are amazingly handy (or so the production folks assure me).andP;  From mystandpoint, however, the style sheets are also one of Word's drawback.andP;  Iwant MacUser style sheets resident in my application, not in individualdocuments.andP;  A nice toggle button allowing me to use our styles as my defaultwould be much appreciated.andM;And how about a modified Scrapbook that saves all your cuts in order withoutyour having to paste them into a separate document? And any Mac applicationwould be improved by some tinkering with the dialog boxes.andP;  At this stage ofthe game, it's a little primitive to be typing along and have to go to themouse when you want one of the nonhighlighted options.andP;  Why no standard,single-letter keyboard commands? Surely that's not too much to ask?andM;These features will seem trivial to a lot of you - and probably many of thefeatures in your perfect program would seem irrelevant to me.andP;  (And I lookforward to your letting me know.) The answer to the never-ending search forthe word-processing Grail is an application with a &quot;construction set.&quot; Itwould have a soli&quot;typing&quot; base and a set of easy procedures to let users addwhatever their little hearts desire.andP;  Permanently.andM;I'm holding my breath.andM;LOW TO ELIMINATE HOLES IN YOUR HARD DISK FOREVERandM;DiskExpress II features ALSoft's revolutionary new Disk Optimatic(TM)technology designed to optimize hard disk performance forever.andP;  It's Menewest fastest sa fest way to optimize.andP;  * Disk Express II automaticallyoptimizes whenever you stop working on your M&quot; and lay down your mouse.andO;Bemuse it's fully transparent, DiskExpress II inntuitively works around yourbusy schedule without tying up your computer.andP;  DiskExpress II constantlyprioritizes and groups your frequently used files for maximum performance.andP;  *andO;DiskExpress II also continually optimizes your disks one file at a time, soit can be interrupted at anytime without scrambling any of your information.andO;In fact, DiskExpress II can optimize even if Mere's virtually no free spaceleft on your disk.andP;  DiskExpress II is also completely compatible withAppleShare(TM) and TOPS? and ft will dramatically speed up your network fileserver.andP;  * To reserve your FREE DiskExpress II (retailing for $89.95 whenreleased in September) including a FREE bonus of ALSoft's MultiPartition(TM)disk partitioner for even better performance, simply order DiskExpress 1.5today (suggested retail $69.95).andP;  You'll not only start optimizing right nowand son at hot $20, you'll be the first to receive your new FREE DiskExpressII to keep you optimized forever.andM;ALSoft, Inc.andM;P.O.andP;  Box 927, Spring, TX 77383-0927andM;713/353-4090</TEXT></DOC>
