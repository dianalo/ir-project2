Many industry officials and economists expect that oil prices will continue to drop, giving a slight lift to the U.S. economy but probably not falling far enough or staying there long enough to have a lasting effect.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, January-delivery crude-oil contracts fell 81 cents a barrel to $16.63, just above the low of the day, for a two-day loss of $1.68. It was the first time since March that the crude price was under $17.    &quot;OPEC has spoken and so has the market -- negatively,&quot; said Richard Donovan, head of the international energy department for E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.    The volume of crude-oil trading was estimated at an all-time high of 152,846 contracts, topping the old mark of 127,386 contracts set last Wednesday, an exchange spokeswoman said.    In the spot, or non-contract market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, dropped 80 cents a barrel to $16.65.    Heating oil for January delivery fell 2.36 cents a gallon to 51 cents; January gasoline was off 1.98 cents to 43.07 cents a gallon.    Additionally, numerous refiners cut to the low-to-mid-$17 range the price they are willing to pay for crude, and other major oil companies are expected to follow suit.    Separately, OPEC ministers, shaken by the near collapse of their Vienna conference, headed home vowing to cheat no more on prices or production quotas, and expressing hope prices won't drop significantly.    OPEC's agreement preserves its widely flouted benchmark price of $18 a barrel. Current official production quotas totaling 16.6 million barrels a day would remain unchanged for the next six months, except that Iraq, which bowed out of the agreement, won't have a quota. That leaves the ceiling for the remaining 12 members at 15.1 million barrels a day, compared with actual OPEC output, including Iraq's, of about 18.5 million barrels daily.    While forecasts vary, many analysts see an ultimate decline of $2 to $3 a barrel in early 1988, with prices moving back up by the second half of the year. George Mitchell, chairman and president of Mitchell Energy andamp; Development Corp. in Houston, predicted prices will fall to $16 a barrel, but will only be that low for about three months.    Chris McCormack, a broker at E.F.andamp; F. Man, said that a drop to $16 is a reasonable expectation &quot;but I can't believe some of the numbers I'm hearing&quot; -- as low as $12.    The effect on the economy is &quot;all very much a question of whether this is a temporary drop of 30 to 60 or 90 days,&quot; said John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York.    Economists generally expect the temporary drop in oil prices to cause some decline in the U.S. trade deficit, but not much. For October, the deficit hit a record $17.63 billion, with energy imports totaling $4.3 billion. Figuring a $2-a-barrel drop in the price of oil, Jeffrey Shott of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, said the value of imports would fall about $500 million if import levels remained the same.    &quot;Five-hundred million dollars out of a deficit that's been averaging almost $14.6 billion a month this year isn't much,&quot; Mr. Shott said. He and other economists noted that there is a good chance oil imports will increase because of the drop in prices, partly offsetting any expected gains. &quot;Every little bit helps,&quot; said James Cochrane, chief economist for Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, &quot;but it's no big deal.&quot;    Mr. Cochrane also expects that a price drop will help to curb growth in inflation and maintain some downward pressure on interest rates; most economists see both of these rising modestly in coming months. Bond markets yesterday had their biggest rally in seven weeks, driven by the oil price decline, which also has partly helped this week's stock upturn.    Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc., Ashland, Ky., is more bearish than most on the oil price outlook, predciting a drop of $4 to $5 a barrel. He estimated such a drop could cut inflation one percentage point.    Consumers at the pump also would benefit, but again the question is how much and for how long. Every $2 decline in the price of crude, Mr. Tahmassebi figures, shaves about a nickel off the retail price of a gallon of gasoline if the savings are passed directly to consumers. But in the past there has almost always been a lag, and in this case it could be two to three months -- by which time prices could start edging back up.    Heating oil inventories are fairly high, so there wouldn't be an immediate retail price decline there either, oil company officials said.    Exploration for oil and gas in the U.S., which has begun to increase in recent months, could suffer. But activity is normally slow in the first quarter, which gives oil companies more time to assess the price outlook.    &quot;The critical period would be where prices are when oil companies start to implement drilling plans on the first of April,&quot; said Ike Kerridge, vice president of Baker Hughes Inc., a major oil-service company based in Houston. &quot;If prices turn up by then, (the current drop) probably will have very little effect.&quot;    Amoco Corp., Chicago, said that it will raise its capital and exploration budget 17% next year to $3.8 billion but added that &quot;because of uncertainties that still face the industry,&quot; the company may change those plans.    Most major oil companies have already budgeted for 1988 spending, and these budgets generally are based on long-term price forecasts. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, where lead times are long, probably won't be affected by any short-term price decline. Land drilling, with shorter lead times, could be hurt fairly quickly.    Earnings of major integrated oil companies would be hurt by a sustained price drop. Ted Eck, Amoco's chief economist, said nothing fundamental has changed to alter the price outlook after OPEC's meeting, but added that psychological factors could drive prices down for a while.    Under that scenario, Mr. Eck said companies' refining operations will become more profitable, but &quot;a lower crude price structure takes dollars away from the industry&quot; because of earnings declines in the production segment of the business.    Independents such as Mitchell Energy don't have refining operations to fall back on, but Mr. Mitchell said recent increases in the price of natural gas could offset crude-price declines. Many independents have high concentrations of gas, compared with oil; Mitchell's wells produce 85% gas, for example.    But much smaller producers, which have already restructured but still have large debts, could be hurt. &quot;If you have to write down the value of your reserves one more time, it hurts,&quot; said Kerry Thornhill-Cummings, a vice president at the investment banking firm Strevig andamp; Associates Inc. in Houston. Even a $1 price drop could wipe out profit margins for tiny operators, she said.    In addition, the already reeling banking industry in such oil-producing states as Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma could wind up having to take over more energy assets, Ms. Thornhill-Cummings said. </TEXT></DOC>
