<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-68-0062 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some of the reagents employed in the decontamination of reactor coolantsystems are potentially hazardous. Potential exposure to decontaminationagents by operating personnel, or members of the general population,could occur during use, processing, transportation to, or disposal ata low-level waste site. Federal and state agencies have promulgated regulationsrelevant to the disposal of decontamination solution waste to preventacute or chronic exposures. In particular, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation(DOT), Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), State of South Carolina, State of Nevada, and the State of Washingtonhave such regulations. These regulations may impact on the choice ofdecontamination solutions, operations procedures, processing methods,or disposal methods. Laws and regulations relate to both chemically hazardous,or toxic materials and to radioactive hazards. Laws which regulate theexposure of workers and the general public to effluents and emissionsduring processing, disposal and transport have been abstracted. As aresult of these regulations, utilities are required to obtain permitsto perform monitoring and sampling of personnel and the on-site and off-siteenvironment, provide proper protective clothing and ventilation, makecertain the solutions are properly contained during use, storage andprocessing, and destroy and/or properly immobilize the residues for disposal.Waste treatment processes such as neutralization, ion exchange, evaporation,incineration, etc., must not produce, nor result in hazardous emissions,effluents, residues, or hazards to workers. The laws also stipulate recordkeeping and documentation.</TEXT></DOC>
