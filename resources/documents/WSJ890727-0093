On Oct. 18, 1988, Delta Air Lines reported finding a similar problem on a Boeing 757, according to the FAA.    The FAA contends that in both cases, &quot;Boeing failed to transmit to FAA a report of these miswirings in an acceptable form until Jan. 4, 1989. It appears Boeing violated federal aviation regulations by not reporting to the agency within 24 hours after determining defects existed.&quot;    Boeing said the FAA's allegation is &quot;unmerited and the threatened enforcement action is unfortunate and unnecessary.&quot; It added that it will &quot;decline to offer the suggested $200,000 levy.&quot;    Boeing has 15 days to respond to the FAA's settlement offer or provide additional information concerning the alleged violations.    The aerospace concern asserts that it properly reported the problems to the FAA in a timely manner, and that Boeing was &quot;responsive to the situation and acted aggressively in cooperation with the FAA to assure that any miswiring was found and corrected.&quot;    Boeing said that although there haven't been any failures of the fire-extinguishing systems in service, it has redesigned them at the suggestion of the FAA.    Boeing has been doing extra tests on the systems since first learning about numerous cases of faulty wiring and plumbing on its entire family of aircraft built after 1980.    As of this spring, 94 separate instances of flawed fire-control systems had come to light. Of these, 15 were identified in the engines or cargo compartments of the more than 200 757s in service. </TEXT></DOC>
