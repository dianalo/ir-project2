Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. Chairman John F. Akers saw his cash compensation rise 18% to $840,896 in 1987, a year in which the world's largest computer company turned in a lackluster performance.    The Armonk, N.Y., giant disappointed many in the computer industry and on Wall Street last year as it continued to have trouble selling midrange computers and desktop machines. Its profit rose 9.8%, or 12% on a per-share basis, in 1987. But without special items earnings would have fallen for the third year in a row, and IBM's stock lagged the Standard andamp; Poor's 400 about 10%. The company has been going through a massive contraction in which thousands of employees have taken early retirement and thousands more have taken new jobs within the company.    IBM took pains yesterday to downplay the magnitude of Mr. Akers's raise. A spokeswoman said the comparison ought to include restricted stock IBM executives receive, which would put his pay increase at 11%: $1,290,000 compared to $1,160,000 in 1986.    The spokeswoman also cited a survey showing that in 1986, even though IBM was the nation's most profitable company, Mr. Akers ranked 124th among highest-paid chief executives. She called Mr. Akers's 1987 compensation &quot;reasonable, appropriate, and competitive with other companies.&quot;    IBM gives its executives restricted stock, which can't be sold until retirement, as bonuses for their previous year's performance. Thus the restricted stock Mr. Akers received in 1987 was pegged to the job he did in 1986. IBM values the restricted stock based on when it was awarded. The company says about two-thirds of its top executives' total compensation depends on the company's results or stock market value.    IBM's proxy statement, released yesterday, also indicates the average cash compensation of all its officers rose only about 4% in 1987 to $304,999. IBM had 70 officers in 1987 and 72 in 1986.    A year ago, Mr. Akers drew attention for taking a 3% cut in his 1986 cash compensation compared with 1985. But counting the restricted stock he received in those years, his compensation actually rose about 7%.    Still, Mr. Akers characterized his 1986 compensation as a cut in an unusual discussion about his pay this month -- on the witness stand in a trial about a late IBM employee's estate.    &quot;In 1986, IBM's earnings declined from 1985, and therefore my compensation didn't grow,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, it declined a little bit, because we want to have our people compensated on the performance of the business. The better the performance of the business, the better the stockholder is rewarded, the better the individual is rewarded. And that's the way it works.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
