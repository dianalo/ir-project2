Terms weren't disclosed.    The company's products perform 3-D graphics for workstations, primarily used in the manufacturing, scientific and engineering markets. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., will most likely use the technology in its IBM PC-RT line of technical workstations.    &quot;The primary benefit of this is strategic,&quot; said Edward McCracken, Silicon Graphics' president and chief executive officer. &quot;It's important for us and our customers to have IBM endorse this new way of computing. This hasn't been a 'safe' technology. We've been out there by ourselves.&quot;    He said the agreement should encourage software developers to write new programs to be used in IBM and Silicon Graphics products. He to declined to comment on the worth of the agreement, but said it won't represent more than 10% of Silicon Graphics' revenues. The company's stock tumbled this summer when the company reported lower-than-expected earnings. Its stock rose late last week on rumors of the pact, but closed Friday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $16, down 25 cents.    The market for technical workstations grew 63% last year, according to Dataquest, a market research concern. In 1987, that market was $2.5 billion, compared with $1.5 billion the year earlier. The market is led by Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Though Silicon Graphics grew rapidly last year, Dataquest estimates the company held only about 4% of the market for technical workstations.    For the year ended June 30, Silicon Graphics posted net income of $12.5 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenues of $152.6 million, from year-earlier net income of $10.3 million, or 82 cents a share, on revenues of $86.3 million. As reported, Silicon Graphics has indicated it will post a net income of between $1.5 million, or nine cents a share, and $1.8 million or 11 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, ending Sept. 30. In the year-earlier period the company posted net income of $3 million, or 22 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
