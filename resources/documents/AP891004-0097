(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state panel set up last year under afirst-in-the-nation gun control law aimed at ridding Maryland ofSaturday Night specials has banned only two weapons and approved627.   An additional 34 pistols, including several small, two-shotDerringers, have been tentatively rejected for sale or manufacturein Maryland by the Handgun Roster Board.   The approved list includes a semi-automatic Uzi pistol fromIsrael and the Glock 17 from Austria that has some plastic partsthat don't show up on airport X-rays.   Among other weapons approved are all handguns made by majormanufacturers such as Colt and Smith andamp; Wesson, as well as handgunsapproved for importation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms.   ``The people who were advocates of the law may be disappointedthat more guns weren't excluded from the list,'' said Simon Atlas,a member of the board. ``But that's the way the law is written.Certainly, the worst fears the National Rifle Association had havebeen laid to rest.''   The NRA vigorously opposed the law last year when it was beforethe Legislature. Among those who campaigned for the law were SarahBrady, wife of presidential press secretary James Brady, who wasshot and wounded along with President Reagan in 1981.   The law makes it illegal beginning in 1990 to sell ormanufacture handguns in Maryland not approved by the nine-memberboard of gubernatorial appointees. Guns made prior to 1985 areexcluded from the ban.   Under law, the panel must consider nine criteria in weighing aparticular weapon, including concealibility, accuracy and quality,to weed out Saturday Night specials _ the small, cheap, low-caliberhandguns often used in street crimes.   Sanford Abrams, president of the Maryland Licensed FirearmsDealers Association, said the criteria used by the board areinexact, but he added, ``I think they're doing a good as job as canbe expected under the circumstances.''   The only two weapons formally banned are .25-caliber and.32-caliber guns made by the L.W. Seecamp Co. of New Haven, Conn.The company no longer makes the .25-caliber model. The .32-calibergun, only 4[ inches long, was not considered safe enough to meetthe requirements of the handgun law.   Larry W. Seecamp, owner of the company, called the board'saction ridiculous. He said the guns cost about $350, are well-madeand are favored by women because they are light. The company alsosells to judges, he said.   Board member Matthew Fenton, who was shot with a handgun severalyears ago, said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the board toban some handguns with ``assault-type features,'' such as the Uzi9mm semi-automatic.   ``I asked why couldn't we just allow those for law enforcementagencies?'' Fenton said.</TEXT></DOC>
