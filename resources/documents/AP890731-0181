(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kindergartners at Parkin Elementary Schoolhave a favorite song:   ``Do you know about scarcity?   ``Yes we do!   ``It means you can't have everything you want.''   This jingle was meant to be a jolly economics lesson for the6-and-under set. But it also summarizes some sober realities forthe 350-pupil school in a poor, isolated farming community innortheastern Arkansas.   The song also aptly describes the fix many rural schools findthemselves in around the country _ at a time when the nation isclamoring for costly education reforms.   In recent years, many states have mandated lower class sizes,tougher teaching standards, additional counselors and expandedcurricula.   Small districts everywhere, especially in farm states where landvalues have declined in the 1980s, say they are being pressed tothe wall to meet such reform demands.   Furthermore, rural communities like Parkin put the lie to thelong-cherished myth that small schools don't have such socialproblems as high dropout and pregnancy rates, drugs and suicides.   ``Our whole school could be called `at risk,''' said JeannetteBennett, principal of Parkin Elementary.   ``Rural schools across the country have an explosion of `atrisk' kids,'' said Doris Helge, executive director of the NationalRural Small Schools Consortium, which is completing a first-evernational survey of the social and economic problems rural childrenare facing.   ``In rural communities, you have wonderful, creative people withwholesome values to help kids. But you don't have the services. Youdon't have the community agencies,'' Helge said.   In one of the few statewide studies ever conducted, Wyoming'sdepartment of education reported in 1987 that up to half thechildren in that predominantly rural state could be considered atrisk in terms of dropping out, teen pregnancy, illiteracy, suicideor crime.   Bennett said motivating her pupils is her biggest challenge.   The eventual choices for most of her youngsters _ three-fourthsof whom are black and 90 percent of whom are poor enough to qualifyfor free school lunches _ will be whether to continue school or toleave and eventually go on welfare.   Life for many of Parkin Elementary's youngsters is so proscribedthat many barely know of Interstate 40, just 11 miles south oftown. Many have never been to Memphis, Tenn., just an hour's driveaway.   Starting in 1983, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton enacted a series ofeducation reforms. In a state ranking last, or nearly so, by mosteducational measures, Clinton and the Legislature agreed to costlyreforms that mandated, among other things, higher teacher salariesand many more course requirements.   All 329 Arkansas districts now teach advanced science, math andforeign language. Barely half did six years ago. The number ofstudents taking foreign languages has more than doubled. Thecollege-going rate increased from 38 percent to 44 percent from1983 to '87.   But the clamor for reform placed many small Arkansas districtslike Parkin in a bind.   Either they must tax their impoverished residents to the limitto pay for new teachers and tougher standards. Or the state canforce districts unable to meet the standards to merge orconsolidate _ a dreaded step to many rural educators who feel theirsmaller schools have priceless virtues.   Compounding the money woes of such districts, the value offarmland has declined in recent years. In Parkin, property valueson which school taxes are based declined from $16.3 million in 1986to $13.9 million in 1988-89. In that period, Parkin raised taxestwice, but school revenues from all sources still remainedvirtually flat: $1.79 million in 1986-87, and a projected $1.72million in 1989-90.   Like many isolated districts, Parkin has little or no industryto bolster the tax base. Townspeople here hope a planned state parkfeaturing an Indian mound will attract tourist dollars.   Making matters worse, the Parkin district has been losingstudents, a common rural phenomenon as families look for betteropportunities. Average kindergarten-through-12th grade enrollmentin 1984-85 was 928. It declined to 785 in 1988-89. Each loststudent cost the district $1,785 in state aid.   ``I'm just sitting here,'' said Parkin Superintendent Joseph``Pete'' Whitby to a visitor, ``figuring out how much money I'mlosing.''   Still, under Bennett's leadership, Parkin Elementary seems to bebeating the economic odds.   Among her accomplishments: 94 percent of the school'sthird-graders passed the state's basic skills test this year,compared to 29 percent four years ago.   One of her teachers, Eda Claire Rucker, has won two nationalawards for developing an economics curriculum for third-graders. Itfeatured lessons about apples, a local commodity.   ``We planted a tree. We went to an apple orchard. We learnedabout taxes. We weighed the apples. We didn't use textbooks. Andthat's what the children like,'' she said.   ``In years gone by, there was no acountability. I think weshould be accountable,'' Bennett said. ``Teachers are made to feelmore a part of a set of goals. We're all in this together. I have awonderful staff. It wasn't always so.''   Teacher salaries top at $19,800, meager even by northeasternArkansas standards. But the starting salary of $16,890 is above thestate minimum.   Thus when Bennett took her post four years ago, she was able toattract a younger, eager staff of teachers, most of them recentgraduates, whom she could mold into a corps with few bad habits tobreak.   With them, she developed a theme of economics education that nowpermeates the curriculum.   Louise Webb's third-graders, for example, took their shoes offto see which countries they were made in. The class then graphedthe results _ a lesson that mixed social studies, math andeconomics.   Bennett's philosophy is that economics education is ``even morebasic than reading, writing and arithmetic'' because it teachesyoungsters values, choice and, above all, motivation.   The school brings in guests to help break down the isolation andinspire youngsters to achieve.   Rodney Slater, a black state highway official, addressed anassembly in the school's cafeteria recently, and was asked by afifth-grader if it was possible to advance in his field withoutgraduating from high school or college.   Slater, who holds advanced degrees, replied: ``Let me say thatthere is no field where you can advance without a degree. Educationis like food. It cannot help you unless you take it in.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, Aug. 8</NOTE></DOC>
