The question is where does he go next? If Tsongas wins orcomes close, he moves on to Maine and Maryland, but partyleaders fear his candidacy would be a disaster outside of NewEngland, especially in the South. Meantime, Clinton could bebadly damaged. &quot;It's a nightmare,&quot; says former party ChairmanJohn White.</LP><TEXT>   Clinton is the only Democrat raising enough money to keepup momentum after New Hampshire. His $821,000 in federalmatching funds for January exceeded all his rivals combined.He has fund-raisers slated in New York, Boston and LosAngeles. Anyone who finishes below second in New Hampshirewill have money trouble. Chances could grow for a late entry,such as Gephardt or Cuomo.   What must worry Republicans &quot;is that the Democrats mightactually have a real exciting convention, and no one knowswhat that might produce,&quot; says GOP theorist Kevin Phillips.                                                                                                          BUSH AIMS to seal a deal with Russia on deeper nucleararms cuts.   Baker plans talks next week in Moscow to close gapsbetween the Yeltsin and Bush plans. Bush's proposals wouldleave about 4,700 strategic warheads in the U.S. arsenal andabout 4,500 in Russia's, while Yeltsin's would cut both sidesto 2,500.   The administration hopes to have agreements in hand whenYeltsin pays a state visit in late spring or early summer.One uncertainty has been whether the Russian leader cannegotiate for all former Soviet republics. U.S. officials nowthink he can succeed by July in pulling all tactical nuclearweapons out of other republics and consolidating them onRussian soil.                                                                                                          BATTLES ERUPT within the White House, Congress overeconomic strategies.   Some top Bush political advisers argue he would gain morefrom a clash with Congress than a compromise. They accusebudget chief Darman and Treasury secretary Brady of being tooconciliatory. Though Bush cuts some Congress-bashing linesfrom speeches, he fingers lawmakers for inaction on theeconomy.   Congressional Democrats move fast on the Bush plan whilesniping at it. &quot;The Democrats are playing this pretty smart,&quot;a White House official concedes. House leaders are inclinedtoward compromise. But Senate Leader Mitchell itches to sendBush a bill he'll veto because of tax increases on the rich,reviving the &quot;fairness&quot; issue.   The time for compromise will end soon. &quot;When partisanshiptakes hold, the opportunity for actually getting things donedecreases,&quot; Darman warns.                                                                                                          CALLING CUOMO: An unauthorized write-in campaign for theNew York governor takes off in New Hampshire where backershope to win 15% of the vote to qualify Cuomo for delegates.&quot;If he gets more than 10% of the vote,&quot; says pollster LeeMiringoff, &quot;he starts passing people who are on the ballot.&quot;                                                                                                          JAPAN BASHING by some Democrats didn't keep thefund-raising arm of congressional Democrats from taking a$10,000 donation from Toyota Motor Sales USA. Meantime, thelobbying firm of Bush campaign strategist Charles Black signsthe U.S. unit of Japanese electronic giant NEC. Black says hewon't work for the new client.                                                                                                          MONEY MEN: Bush advisers defend a campaign financecommittee that includes Wall Street takeover king HenryKravis and Florida sugar grower Jose Fanjul, whose relianceon import quotas runs against Bush's free-trade views. &quot;Whatare you going to do-get schoolteachers to be yourfund-raising people?&quot; asks a top campaign official.                                                                                                          DIPLOMATIC SHAKE-UP: A big reshuffling of U.S. ambassadorsis in the works as many end their scheduled three-year tours.One change being discussed: Assistant Secretary of StateRichard Solomon could become ambassador to the Philippines,replacing Frank Wisner who would get a senior StateDepartment job.                                                                                                          GROWING DOMINANCE of three U.S. airlines raises calls forre-regulation.   GOP Arizona Sen. McCain calls the hold of American, Unitedand Delta on airline markets &quot;a deregulated monopoly.&quot;Minnesota Rep. Oberstar, a Democrat, pushes a bill to tightenrules for airline reservation systems and give smallerairlines more access to major airports. Germany and Francewant to protect home carriers against increased competitionfrom the U.S. airlines.   But the Bush administration and the airline industrydismiss monopoly concerns. The Transportation Department'sPatrick Murphy notes that lower interest rates and fuelprices have lifted prospects for the less healthy airlines.The Air Transport Association cites a study showing airfares, adjusted for inflation, have fallen 20% since 1978.   Even Sen. McCain concedes it may be too late to boostcompetition: &quot;So many airlines have disappeared, it makes itmore and more difficult.&quot;                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Hoping to reach its kind of voters in NewHampshire, the Libertarian Party's presidential candidateruns TV ads during re-runs of &quot;Star Trek.&quot; . . .
