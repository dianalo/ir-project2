The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, investigating improprieties in the generic drug industry, made the allegation against Par President Perry Levine and his son, Jeffrey M. Levine, executive vice president, in a letter to a Baltimore federal judge. The judge will sentence Par and its Quad Pharmaceuticals subsidiary on Wednesday on one count of paying an illegal gratuity to a Food and Drug Administration official. Two other top officers of the Spring Valley, N.Y., generic drug maker have pleaded guilty to providing illegal gratuities to FDA employees and are awaiting sentencing.    Perry Levine has said he would retire once a successor has been found. Jeffrey Levine is on leave from the board. Neither has been charged with any crime.    Par officials didn't return phone calls.    Par will be the subject of a subcommittee hearing today.    The panel has been looking into payments of cash and gifts to FDA employees to speed the drug approval process of some companies while disadvantaging others.    In a briefing memorandum attached to the letter to federal Judge John R. Hargrove, the subcommittee said Par's FDA applications to make generic drugs &quot;are rife with problems such as material false statements, systematic destruction of unfavorable test results concerning both products under development and those already marketed, and material alterations in chemical formulations between bioequivalance tested and marketed products.&quot;    Such revelations raise serious questions about the chemical makeup, safety and efficacy of generic drugs. Both the FDA and the generic industry trade association have said they aren't aware of any unsafe generic drugs sold to consumers.    Part of the panel hearing will focus on the FDA's role. Top compliance officials at the FDA's generic division said in a recent interview they didn't begin to investigate Par's manufacturing facilities until April. However, the company had disclosed in October 1988 that it was the target of a federal grand jury probe led by the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore. That year-old investigation was triggered by evidence gathered by Mylan Laboratories Inc., a Pittsburgh generic drug maker.    Also a chemist in the FDA's antibiotic drug review branch noted in an October 1985 memo to Dr. Marvin Seife, then director of the generic drug review division, that batches of two injectable drugs produced by Par's Quad unit &quot;weren't produced according to the manufacturing instructions in the applications.    &quot;Since Quad Pharmaceuticals has submitted almost 60 applications . . . in a very short time period, it is possible that drug product may have been prepared for other applications in a similar manner,&quot; the chemist wrote. His memo was an exhibit in an earlier subcommittee hearing.    Some analysts have long voiced suspicions about Quad because in only its second year of existence it received approvals for more products than any other company in the history of the FDA.    In addition, Dr. Seife recently testified that he suspected in 1986 that Par and Quad were among a handful of companies that got favorable treatment from review chemists. Specifically, Dr. Seife noted a &quot;close relationship&quot; between Dilip Shah, a former FDA employee who became president and chief executive officer of Quad and an FDA generic supervisor, Charles Chang, who has resigned from the agency after pleading guilty to two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with another generic drug maker. Dr. Seife, who has declined to be interviewed, testified that he tried to steer drug applications from suspect companies away from the reviewer Mr. Chang.    Mr. Shah pleaded guilty to providing about $1,000 to Mr. Chang. Walter Kletch, an ex-FDA review chemist, pleaded guilty to accepting two $500 gift certificates from Mr. Shah.    Ashok Patel, a former senior vice president at Par, also pleaded guilty to giving Mr. Chang about $500. David Brancato, another former FDA chemist, also pleaded guilty to receiving cash gratuities from Messrs. Shah and Patel.    Messrs. Shah and Patel each face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $250,000 fine. And Par and its Quad unit each face as much as $500,000 in fines.    The panel's focus on the safety of drugs may hinge on FDA inspections of Quad this past January and November 1988 that disclosed a host of problems at the maker of injectable products. A synopsis of the inspections was made an exhibit at an earlier panel hearing. Some highlights:    --Six children complained of abdominal toxicity after using Quad's vincristine sulfate, used in cancer chemotherapy. Five of the children previously were treated with a similar medication from another manufacturer and didn't suffer any adverse effects. Quad failed to report the complaint as required by the FDA.    --In May 11, 1987, Quad's sales director wrote a misleading letter to as many as 4,000 doctors &quot;in an attempt to capitalize on the shortage&quot; of a tuberculosis vaccine produced by a competitor. The letter didn't distinguish between the two products. Patients could have been harmed if doctors didn't realize the difference.    --An FDA compliance official advised the Veterans Administration marketing center on June 30, 1986, that the agency couldn't recommend purchase of a drug called metoclopramide hcl, used to relieve severe heartburn. The official said Quad had marketed the product before the patent on the brand-name product expired.    --The same FDA official on June 10, 1986, recommended to Veterans Administration that it reject a cancer drug called methotrexate sodium because Quad failed to obtain either new drug approval or generic drug approval to sell the medicine.    --Several other Quad employees provided false statements during inspections. </TEXT></DOC>
