 Storage options will include 40-, 80- and 160-Mbyte harddrives.andP;  Pricing is expected to begin at somewhat less than $10,000.andP;  Unitswith parity checking and a logic-board upgrade for Mac II/IIx owners are duein May or June.andM;According to Apple documents reviewed by MacWEEK, Apple also is preparing thenext generation of A/UX, its version of Unix; a new keyboard called theExtended Keyboard II; and three display boards.andM;Most notable among the cards is the Macintosh Display Card 8*24 CG, whichcombines QuickDraw acceleration with 24-bit color display.andP;  In addition,Apple will roll out the 4*8, which displays either 16 or 256 shades of coloror gray levels, and the 8*24, which when fully configured can display up to16.8 million colors.andP;  The new cards drive all Apple monitors and replace thecompany's current color and gray-scale video cards.andM;With the new hardware Apple will release System 6.0.5.andP;  The rollout  willalso include a demonstration and status report on System 7.0, which will gointo beta in April and is now slated for release by early fall.andM;The company also is expected to set the ship date, probably late in thesecond quarter, for MacX, its implementation of the X Window Display Serverunder both the Finder and A/UX.andP;  X Window is a widely used device-independentwindowing system developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology inCambridge.andM;The rollout campaign for the Mac IIfx and other products will reportedly getunder way March 6, when AppleTV will broadcast a preview of the launch toApple employees and resellers.andM;The public introduction will take place at the San Jose Convention Center,although Apple will also stage regional introductions elsewhere, including atthe Federal Office Systems Exposition in Washington, D.C., and at theNational Computer Graphics Show in Anaheim, Calif.andM;The European premiere is set for the CeBIT show in Hannover, West Germany,later this month.andP;  Instead of the usual six-week to six-month lag betweenU.S.andP;  and international releases of new CPUs, Apple plans to ship French,German and International (English) versions of the IIfx, includingdocumentation and software, within a week of the U.S.andP;  introduction,according to Apple documents.andM;Like previous additions to the Mac family, the new IIfx was designed formaximum compatibility with its older siblings, and compatibility listsincluded in Apple documents reviewed by MacWEEK show that most majorapplications should work normally.andM;A number of hardware changes, however, could trip up some software:andM;andgt;Any program that directly addresses the serial communications controller orApple Desktop Bus circuitry will bomb, the documents warn.andP;  Since I/O ishandled in the Mac IIfx by custom processors, the hardware is no longeraccessible to applications; developers must instead call the appropriatesoftware managers and drivers.andM;Apple, however, may bail out at least some third-party developers whoseproducts access the serial controller directly.andP;  Company engineers haveproduced a &quot;compatibility cdev&quot; (Control Panel device) that makes it possiblefor programs to bypass the serial IOP (I/O Processor) chip and directlyaccess the hardware.andP;  &quot;Selected third-party developers&quot; will be authorized todistribute the cdev with their applications.andM;andgt;In particular, the documents say, programs that use floppy disk-based copyprotection will not work on the new machine.andP;  Such schemes, although mostlylimited to games in the U.S.andP;  market, are still prevalent in Europe.andP;  Applewill offer technical advice to help developers come up with alternativeapproaches to copy protection.andM;Managers and technicians fitting out the new machines will also have to bewary of several misleading and potentially dangerous similarities betweenelements of the IIfx and previous models.andM;andgt;The IIfx's processor-direct slot looks like that of the Mac IIci, but if aIIci cache card is installed in the newer model, the logic board as well asthe cache card itself could be damaged.andM;andgt;The 64-pin SIMMs (single in-line memory modules) used in the IIfx resemblethose in the LaserWriter IINTX.andP;  Installing NTX SIMMs in the IIfx, however,could cause system errors and even data corruption, the documents say,because the LaserWriter requires only 150-nanosecond memory, while the IIfxneeds chips that are almost twice as fast.andP;
