Selected solar plants are controlled by measurements, in orderto obtain information on: degree of use of solar plants, solar coveringrate, ability of components to work, operating behaviour of plant andcomponents, effectiveness of different control strategies, proposalsfor improving the dimensions, installation and operation of systems,costs and economy of solar plants. Technical data of such a collectorplant and an absorber heat pump plant and its special structural featuresare given. It is found that these installed solar plants are able tomake a considerable contribution to saving conventional energy sources.The preconditions for this are expert planning, installation and operation.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
