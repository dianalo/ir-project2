He said the inquiry covering all 1984-89 Broncos will try todetermine if the vehicle, the types of drivers who use it, or theenvironment in which it is driven contributed to the fatal accidents.   Ford Motor Co. said it believes the record of its 590,000 BroncoIIs is not significantly different from that of other sport utilityvehicles.   ``The Bronco II is a well-designed, safe utility vehicle, andFord believes that the accident statistics do not reflect anysafety-related defect,'' the company said in a statement fromDetroit. It added that accidents in all such vehicles are ``stronglyinfluenced by adverse driver or environmental factors.''   Ford spokeswoman Barbara Mansfield in Washington said the companyhas done extensive testing on the Bronco II to verify it has``reasonable and appropriate handling and stabilitycharacteristics.''   According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included inlast year's report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehiclerollovers resulted in fatalities in 1987, or 19 for every 100,000vehicles on the road. There were eight fatal Samurai rollovers, orsix per 100,000 vehicles; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazer orGMC Jimmy, also six per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokeerollovers, for 2.5 per 100,000.   The study gives no breakdown of which rollovers occurred inoff-road conditions or other details about the accidents.   The traffic safety administration will conduct an ``engineeringanalysis'' of the Bronco II, which is the second of three levels ofinvestigation.   In the Samurai investigation, which was completed last Aug. 25,the agency concluded that critics of the vehicle failed todemonstrate that it has an excessive tendency to roll over. Theagency's Office of Defects Investigation denied a recall petitionfiled by the Center for Auto Safety, a public interest group oftenat odds with the industry and its regulators.   Consumer Reports magazine, in a July 1988 issue, called for a banof the Samurai, saying ``it literally trips over its own feet.'' Themagazine's publisher, Consumer Union, also petitioned for standardscovering all vehicles to prevent rollovers.   Safety administration spokesman Hurd said that although thedecision to conduct an engineering analysis of the Bronco II wasformally based on complaints to the safety administration, it alsois the result of the statistics that turned up in the Samuraiinvestigation.   In the Samurai inquiry, the agency described rollovers as``complicated dynamic events'' and acknowledged that their causesare not entirely understood by automotive experts.   It cited factors such as inexperienced drivers, lack of seat beltuse, alcohol use, driver error, and poor weather as contributing tomost of the Samurai rollover deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
