Davis said he didn't know what wouldhappen to Smith, and Siegel said he believed Smith would remain in thesecurity department for the time being and report to the Oakland policecommander brought in to run the operation.;    Six Oakland Housing Authorityofficers have been convicted on a variety of charges in federal court,including beating people they arrested and conspiring to deny suspects theircivil rights. The OHA force is responsible for patrolling the city's 10,000low-income housing units.;    Before the vote, several friends of Smith andprominent members of Oakland's black community rose to his defense, suggestingthat the attack on him was racially motivated. Among them was the Rev. J.Alfred Smith Sr. of the Allen Temple Baptist Church, who charged that theOakland Police Department itself has a history of abusing minorities.;   Three of the four commissioners who voted to remove Smith are black.;   Smith's defenders also spoke on Davis' behalf, intimating that the newcommissioners might next go after the powerful executive director, who has runthe housing authority since 1972.;    But Siegel said after the meeting hedidn't believe Davis was close enough to the security department to havedirect accountability for its problems.;    Davis &quot;has nothing to fear from meat this time,&quot; Siegel said.;    The timing of the transfer of power to anOakland police commander hasn't been settled yet. The city council Tuesdaynight postponed for one week action on authorizing the police department tosend a lieutenant to the housing authority.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARRY WITT, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910606  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  410  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 6, 199100158092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
