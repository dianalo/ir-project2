From strictly design basis transientsand the determination of margins and setpoints, emphasis continues toshift to risk-dominant sequences and the importance of equipment reliabilityand operator actions. The importance simulation in training, proceduredevelopment and accident management follows form these developments.The increase is computer power per dollar places the issue of how bestto utilize large mainframe codes in sharper focus.</TEXT></DOC>
