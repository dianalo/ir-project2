North and three otherIran-Contra criminal defendants say they won't be ready for trialuntil March 1989, after President Reagan leaves office.   In the first pre-trial hearing in the case, the defense team'sproposed schedule was sharply at odds with that of independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who said he would be prepared for trialthis July.   The dispute Tuesday left the matter to U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell, who demanded a tight pre-trial schedule, butwarned there may be no case at all unless thousands of governmentdocuments are declassified _ and made available to the defense.   The nearly four hours of courtroom arguments were devotedentirely to legal questions that were crucial to the case, but farremoved from the web of covert operations and multimillion-dollarfinancial transactions detailed in the 23-count indictment.   Gone was the drama of the March 24 arraignment, when formerNational Security Council staffer North; ex-National SecurityAdviser John M. Poindexter; retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord, and his business partner, Albert Hakim, pleaded innocent tothe charges.   The masterminds of the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran andassistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during congressionalprohibitions are charged with running those operations as a broadcriminal conspiracy.   A federal grand jury charged them with defrauding the governmentand then trying to cover up their alleged crimes. North, Secord andHakim were accused of personally enriching themselves from theIran-Contra affair.   The next step in the case is an April 25 hearing that will givean indication of whether Walsh's evidence is fully admissible.   All the defendants except Secord were given congressionalimmunity to testify before the Iran-Contra committees last summer.   The law prohibits Walsh from using the compelled congressionaltestimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.   Gesell, who said the hearing would not be the final word on``tainted'' evidence, invited the defense team to present onewitness in an effort to prove its contention that much of Walsh'sevidence is inadmissible.   Barry Simon, a lawyer for North, accepted the challenge,commenting, ``We think we can draw blood very quickly'' bypresenting a grand jury witness who would testify he was influencedby immunized testimony.   ``Unless I'm satisfied steps were taken (to avoid taint), I'mnot going to try this case,'' Gesell said.   J. Herbert Stern, a former federal judge who is handling thequestion for Walsh, told Gesell the independent counsel wouldlikely testify at the hearing on the extensive procedures heundertook to avoid reading or listening to the congressionaltestimony.   In addition to the immunity question, the judge said a majorobstacle to a trial is the stack of 300,000 classified documentsthat must be submitted to an inter-agency task force to see if theycan be declassified _ and given to the defense.   ``We can't try a classified documents case. It will neverwork,'' the judge said.   Walsh estimated that only some 50,000 of the documents wererelevant to the case, but Gesell said the defense team must haveaccess to all the records, and make its own decisions.   Gesell raised the question of a July trial date. Walsh said hecould be ready by then, although he said September would be ``morerealistic.''   Without elaboration, Gesell said he did not want ``the trialunderway when the ballots are being counted'' for the Novemberpresidential election. He also ruled out a trial that would runinto the Christmas vacation, because it would be too great a burdenon jurors, who likely would be sequestered.   Poindexter lawyer Richard W. Beckler told Gesell, ``I don'treally see a trial actually starting before March of next year.''   Beckler said numerous defense motions would be filed, includingone to dismiss the case on grounds the defendants were ``carryingout the foreign policy of the president of the United States. We'redealing with a political question rather than a question ofcriminality,'' Beckler said.   ``Don't spend a great deal of time on that one,'' Gesell said.   When the question of pre-trial publicity was raised, Gesell, whopresided at some of the Watergate trials, said that experiencetaught him not to worry about the problem because ``a lot of peopledon't read or pay any attention to the publicity.''</TEXT></DOC>
