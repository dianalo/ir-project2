(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A brake shoe manufacturer will not have topay a record $2.7 million fine for asbestos exposure violationsunder terms of a settlement with the federal government.   U.S. District Judge Garrett Brown on Monday approved a pactbetween the Labor Department and Friction Division Products Inc. Theagreement requires the Trenton factory to provide respirators,protective clothing and other safety measures for its 125 workers.   If a safety monitor certifies the company's compliance, FrictionDivision will avoid paying what would amount to the heftiest fineever levied by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fora safety violation, officials said.   The agreement requires no admission of wrongdoing by the factory.   Company President Robert Carney had not immediate comment on theagreement, his secretary said.   Federal officials, when they announced the fine a month ago,described flagrant violations of worker protection standards at theplant.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole displayed photographs of asbestosdust coating tables, stairs and railings and of workers eating in alunchroom while wearing contaminated work clothes.   Federal officials also said the workers could bring the asbestoshome on their contaminated clothing, exposing their families.   The agreement, in addition to requiring respirators, orders thecompany to supply soap and towels for mandatory end-of-shift showersand to make sure employees' clothes are vacuumed before workersenter the lunchroom.   Asbestos, a fire- and heat-resisting material once commonly usedas insulation, has been linked to lung cancer and asbestosis, a lungdisease.   If the company does not follow through on the agreement, OSHAwill revert to the fine and other remedies, said Randy Wilson, alabor department public affairs officer in New York.   The head of a union local representing the plant's employees saidhe was pleased by the agreement.   However, Ivey Williams, president of International ChemicalWorkers Local 155, said the union was still considering a lawsuit tohelp the workers win compensation for whatever health damage theymay have suffered.   The workers _ about half of whom have stayed off the job sincedisclosure of the safety violations _ are undergoing healthscreenings, he said.   Mrs. Dole said last month that investigators had found a handfulof cases of lung cancer and asbestosis among the workers.</TEXT></DOC>
