Themagnitude of systematic effects on these measurements is found to belarger than previously suspected; the abundances subsequently derivedare lower than those previously reported. The largest He-3/H abundanceratio is more than 10 times greater than the smallest present limit,furnishing strong support for source-to-source variations. Attentionis given to the usefulness of He-3(+) as a probe of the chemical evolutionof the Milky Way. 16 references.</TEXT></DOC>
