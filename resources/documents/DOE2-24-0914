<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0914 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two reconstruction methods that recognize smoothness to be a priori informationand use numerically space-limited basis functions have been developed.The first method is a modification of the well-known convolution methodand uses such basis functions for the projections. The second methodis a continuous algebraic reconstruction technique that employs consistentbasis functions for the projections as well as the distribution and makesuse of other a priori information like the constraints on the domainas well as the range of the distribution in a rigorous way. The efficacyof these methods has been demonstrated using a limited number of projectionssynthetically generated from a distribution phantom.</TEXT></DOC>
