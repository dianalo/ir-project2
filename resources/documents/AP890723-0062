(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The lanky strike leader smiled inthe gloom of the west Siberian hotel room, puffed deeply on astrong Russian cigarette, smiled and said: ``I never thought Iwould have this conversation.''   ``They used to tell us that foreign corresondents wanted to comehere to mark our factories on their maps so they could drop nuclearbombs on them,'' said Vyacheslav G. Akulov.   ``Now you come here to cover our strike.''   Akulov, 38, one of 26 members of the Strike Committee in theKuznetsk Coal Basin of western Siberia, is amazed at the changestaking place in his country.   Like other strike leaders interviewed Thursday and Friday inProkopyevsk, he expressed more hope than anger in explaining theminers' demands, and he radiated confidence at governmentconcessions that sent the miners back to work on Friday.   Hundreds of thousands of miners elsewhere in the country remainon strike in the largest industrial job action in the Soviet Unionin 60 years.   The miners, like nearly everyone else in the Soviet Union, havebeen watching nationally televised sessions of the new Congress ofPeople's Deputies, which met in May and June, and the reconstitutedSupreme Soviet, the standing parliament.   The lawmakers have inspired the nation with step afterunprecedented step, rejecting Cabinet nominees and criticizing thearmed Forces, the KGB and other former sacred cows of Sovietcommunism.   On July 11, coal miners in Mezhdurechensk, near Prokopyevsk and1,200 miles east of Moscow, decided it was their turn to speak outand began a strike that at its height involved half the nation's 1million coal miners and stretched from the Arctic to Central Asiaand the Ukraine.   The miners want better benefits and higher wages so they can buyWestern-style goods; they also want the right to strike and morerepresentative trade unions.   Among the lawmakers that Akulov admires most is Andrei D.Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who was sent into externalexile in 1980 for his dissident views but who has since beenrehabilitated.   ``Before, we were told that Sakharov was anti-Soviet. And webelieved them. Now we find out that he was the conscience of thenation, one of the few people who had the courage to stand up andspeak the truth when it was dangerous. That's what we all need todo now,'' said Akulov.   Akulov, from the city of Anzhero-Sudzhensk at the northern endof the Kuznetz Basin or Kuzbass, is an engineer who installs steelsupports in the deep mines of the region. He has the sinewy armsand gaunt face of many Siberian miners.   Akulov, who has rarely left the Kuznetz Basin and never beforemet a Westerner, says he has no trouble envisioning the demise ofthe one-party Communist system and the development of severalparties contending for popular support.   ``That's like you have in the United States, isn't it? Severalparties present their ideas in the legislature, debate them andfind a compromise. That how it should be. That's what we need,'' hesaid, bringing his fists together.   Akulov grinned, showing several gold teeth.   ``If I had said these things even five years ago, I would havebeen asking for a trip even deeper into Siberia,'' he said. ``Butit's good that we're tearing down the Iron Curtain and now canlearn what goes on abroad.''   Besides their demands for higher living standards and politicalreforms, the miners want a greater voice in managing their industry_ a demand they won in the agreement that sent them back to work onFriday.   Coal mines in the Kuzbass will remain under the Coal MiningIndustry, but starting Jan. 1 they may form regional associationswith the right to market coal they produce above and beyond thegovernment quota.   The miners hope to eliminate the state quota ``step by step,''said Akulov, and to achieve what the Soviets call regional economicautonomy.   ``It is hard to say exactly where this idea came from, but itwas not born all at once,'' he said. ``It had been building for along time.''   Government leaders say the idea needs to be worked out by thelegislature, but the fact they have agreed to it at all marks amajor step in the decentralization of economic decision-makingpower, which has been concentrated in Moscow since the 1917Bolshevik Revolution.</TEXT></DOC>
