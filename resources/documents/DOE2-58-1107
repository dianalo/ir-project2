<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1107 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report surveys the application of biotechnology (including in vitrocloning and genetic engineering) in addressing some of the major problemsencountered in growing and utilizing plants for energy production. Thescope is restricted to the problems that occur in the production of theraw material (the growing of the plant) and not in the actual processingof the biomass (energy conversion). The focus is limited to the fourherbaceous plants (sorghum, switchgrass, weeping lovegrass, and sericealespedeza) and the seven woody plants (popular, black locust, sycamore,sweetgum, silver maple, alder and eucalyptus) that are currently targetedby the DOE Biomass Production Program. The first part of the report definesthe problems with each species that are or may be approachable by biotechnology.The second part gives recommendations on the research emphases incorporatingbiotechnological approaches for three funding scenarios: (1) fundingcontinued at the levels currently experienced by the Biomass ProductionProgram, (2) earmarking $500,000 additional each year for biotechnologyfor three years, and (3) earmarking $500,000 additional each year forbiotechnology for five years. 68 refs., 1 fig., 22 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
