Variousmethods for surveying and testing from surface ground were carried outat the site of Experimental Fast Reactor 'JOYO' which is deeply embeddedin compacted sand and granular quaternary ground. The following methodswere mainly carried out. (1) Penetration test: Standard penetration test,Large scale penetration test, Static corn penetration test (2) Surfaceelastic wave exploration: P.S wave exploration in boring hole, Shallowseismio reflection method, Sonic wave exploration (3) Boring wall pressuretest (4) Boring wall shear test (5) Undisturbance core sampling (6) Laboratorydynamic triaxial tests. The reliance of above surveying and testing methodswere studied and the improvement in future were clarified.</TEXT></DOC>
