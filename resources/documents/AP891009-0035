The biennial review of the 1959 Antarctica Treaty, which openstoday, will also consider issues such as the disposal of hazardouswastes and controlling the wave of tourists visiting the continent.   But the question of whether to allow mining on the frozencontinent is expected to be the most vigorously debated.   Australia and France, whose policies have changed to reflectgrowing public concern for the environment, are pitted in thedispute against countries such as the United States and Japan thatgenerally favor regulated exploitation.   In the past 15 months, Australia and France have reversed theirpositions on an international convention reached in Wellington, NewZealand, that would open Antarctica to carefully regulated mining.Thirty-three of the 39 nations adhering to the Antarctica Treatyinitialed the accord in June 1988.   ``Mining in Antarctica is not compatible with protection of thefragile Antarctic environment,'' Premier Michel Rocard of Franceand Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in a joint statementissued Aug. 18.   Because the Wellington Convention required unanimous agreement,their decision torpedoed the accord for the foreseeable future.   The decision by France, a country not known for itsenvironmental policies, was a surprise to many diplomats. But,French officials said, President Francois Mitterrand has realizedthat environmental problems such as global warming and the thinningof the earth's ozone shield require a global response.   ``The mounting concern about the environment is indisputable,''one Foreign Ministry official said in a background briefing. ``Wefeel it here in France and our partners undoubtedly feel it aswell.''   Some countries, such as the United States, fear the collapse ofthe Wellington Convention will weaken the good will among nationsthat has kept the continent at the foot of the world a place ofpeace and scientific cooperation.   A voluntary moratorium on mineral exploitation remains in place,and few diplomats said they were worried about a rush to dig anddrill in the absence of the convention.   To fill the legal void, Australia and France have proposed thatAntarctica be declared a ``wilderness park'' where mining would beprohibited and other human activity carefully controlled.   This ambitious proposal, which was to be debated in thecorridors during the 10-day Paris meeting, has the support ofBelgium and India, Australian diplomats said. Italy also has votedto not sign the minerals convention.   The U.S. position is shared by New Zealand, Chile and Japan,which is heavily dependent on foreign oil imports. These countriessay the stringent controls in the mining convention assure theprotection of wildlife, habitat and marine resources.   ``This agreement establishes environmental principles which arevery important,'' said the State Department's Tucker Scully, headof the U.S. delegation.   Besides, he said, ``The U.S. is not a single-interestconstituency. There are economic interests who say, `We are notinterested in mining now, but we cannot exclude the possibility.'These interests are politically significant.''   Scully said that deciding Antarctica's future ``on the basis ofemotions rather than facts is a bad precedent.''   But, environmentalists say, the U.S. position may be in flux.They point to a resolution introduced last week by Sen. AlbertGore, D-Tenn., to prevent ratification of the minerals accord.   ``Congress is responding to a shift in American attitudes'' onthe environment, said James Barnes, director of the Antarctic andSouthern Oceans Coalition. ``I'd say the administration is out oftouch.''   The U.S. attitude toward development in the Antarctic may beinfluenced by the recent oil spill in Alaska that fouled thestate's pristine coastline. Nearly 11 million gallons of oilspilled from the Exxon Valdez after it ran aground on a reef March24 shortly after the tanker pulled out of the harbor at Valdez,Alaska, the southern terminal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.   The United States hopes Australia and France will change theirposition on mining in Antarctica. But the two countries have theirown plans.   ``We will go slowly,'' Rocard told the French news magazineL'Express in August. ``These ideas have to incubate a little whilefor there to be a meeting of the minds.''</TEXT></DOC>
