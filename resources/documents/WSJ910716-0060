The decision, handed down by the Second Circuit Court ofAppeals in New York, significantly clarifies a key area oflegal conflict in the workplace: whether employers who layoff highly paid employees are discriminating on the basis ofage. Courts have held that such terminations violate thefederal Age Discrimination Employment Act where salaryincreases are pegged specifically to years of experience, asin the teaching profession.</LP><TEXT>   In a suit brought against Times Mirror Magazines Inc.,Eugene A. Bay, used that theory to allege he wasdiscriminated against because of his age when he wasdowngraded from his $150,000-a-year position as publisher ofField and Stream magazine in 1987 and then replaced by ayounger, less well-paid executive. New York employment lawspecialist Leonard M. Flamm, who represented Mr. Bay,maintained that his salary was &quot;a direct function of hislongevity, experience, seniority {and} periodic salaryincreases.&quot; Hence, the lawyer argued, Mr. Bay's demotion andsubsequent dismissal at age 54 constituted a form of agediscrimination.   But in a unanimous decision, the appeals court ruled thatemployers are entitled to cut costs by eliminating morehighly paid positions so long as each decision is handledindividually on the merits, no blanket policies are put inplace that work unfairly against older employees and thedecisions &quot;are based solely on financial considerations.&quot;   The decision comes at a time when companies hit hard bythe recession are laying off older, more highly paidexecutives. While the ruling is only binding in New York,Connecticut and Vermont, other states can be expected to payclose attention to it, said M. Chinta Gaston, a lawyer atGibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher in New York, who helped representTimes Mirror Magazines, a unit of Times Mirror Co.   The opinion also clarified another aspect of employmentlaw that has recently been in question: whether firing orrefusing to hire employees because they are &quot;overqualified&quot;can be ground for an age discrimination suit.   Last January, the Second Circuit ruled that in somecircumstances &quot;overqualification&quot; can serve as a pretext forage discrimination. But in Mr. Bay's case, the appeals courtruled that employers can deny positions to overqualifiedapplicants if there is evidence that giving them the job will&quot;affect performance negatively.&quot; The issue came up in Mr.Bay's case because he was dismissed after complaining abouthis demotion.   &quot;Dissatisfaction in a downgraded position is a legitimatereason for an employer to replace an employee with someonenot distracted by such dissatisfaction,&quot; the court ruled.   ---   OUT-OF-WEDLOCK CHILD, adopted at birth, seeks share ofparents' fortune.   In a quirky case that pits a 130-year-old New Hampshirestatute against the dictionary definition of &quot;legitimate,&quot;Elizabeth Ann Charney is fighting to be named a beneficiaryof a multimillion dollar trust that her biologicalgrandfather established in 1920.   Adopted immediately after her birth in 1956, Ms. Charneybegan searching for her biological parents about 15 yearsago. She discovered that she had been born out of wedlock toPierre Dumaine and Evelyn Humphreys -- and that the couplehad later married, five years after conceiving their child.She also learned that Pierre Dumaine's father, Frederic, hadamassed a fortune in textile mills and railroads and hadcreated a trust for his children and their offspring.   Ms. Charney's attorneys, Mark Langan and Dort Biggs ofWiggin andamp; Nourie in Manchester, N.H., estimate the value ofthe privately held Dumaine trust at $150 million and say Ms.Charney's share could be about $300,000 a year. The Dumainetrust beneficiaries own about 60% of Amoskeag Co., a Bostonholding company, said Joseph A. Millimet, an attorney for thetrustees.   New Hampshire law stipulates that a child born out ofwedlock automatically becomes legitimate if the parentssubsequently marry one another. Ms. Charney, a Floridaschoolteacher, believes she falls in this category;furthermore, she says, her biological parents publiclyacknowledged her as their daughter in 1978.   But Frederic Dumaine's heirs say their patriarch didn'thave this legal definition in mind when he drew up the trustand named as beneficiaries his seven &quot;legitimate&quot; childrenand their &quot;legitimate&quot; issue. The New Hampshire SuperiorCourt upheld the heirs' interpretation last March, rulingthat despite the state's law -- on the books since 1860 --Ms. Charney doesn't qualify as legitimate.   The state Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on thequestion of legitimacy. In addition, the court must decidewhether Ms. Charney's early adoption nullifies her claim tothe Dumaine fortune regardless of her legal status.   Courts in several other states, most notably Pennsylvania,have upheld the legitimacy of out-of-wedlock children whoseparents subsequently marry. But the adoption issue presents anew wrinkle and moves the case into uncharted ground,attorneys said.   &quot;It's a fascinating problem and a very intriguing case,&quot;said William Schwartz, a New York attorney representing Ms.Charney. &quot;It's the kind of case we would pose as ahypothetical for our students in law school. But this time,truth is stranger than fiction.&quot;   ---   PRODUCT LIABILITY SUIT can't be brought against publisher,court says.   An attempt by two mushroom lovers to hold a publisherliable for severe illnesses they endured after eating wildmushrooms deemed safe by The Encyclopedia of Mushrooms wasrejected by the federal appeals court in San Francisco.   In the case, Winter v. G.P. Putnam's Sons, the lawyers forthe mushroom connoisseurs used a rarely used productliability theory, contending that an encyclopedia publisherimplicitly warrants to its readers that information withinits publication is accurate. Bruce E. Krell, one of theplaintiffs' lawyers, said they went after the U.S. publisher,Putnam, because the law barred them from bringing the Britishpublisher and British authors to court.   Judge Joseph T. Sneed, ruling for a three-judge panel ofthe Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected theargument on First Amendment grounds before the case had achance to go to a jury. &quot;We place a high priority on theunfettered exchange of ideas,&quot; Judge Sneed wrote. &quot;We acceptthe risk that words and ideas have wings we cannot clip andwhich carry them we know not where.&quot;   Maxwell Lillienstein, an attorney for the AmericanBooksellers Association, said any other ruling would havediscouraged encyclopedia publishers from publishing. Mr.Lillienstein said that the ruling does not cover cookbookauthors and others who purport to be experts.   ---   NOTED: Miller andamp; Chevalier, a 90-attorney firm based inWashington and specializing in tax and federal regulatorypractices, has established a new practice group devoted toSupreme Court and appellate litigation.
