Too many thrift managers have run up big losses grabbing for the golden ring; too many took the high-risk route.    But my friend Mr. Mayer missed his target in one crucial respect: his failure to recognize that the survival of thrift institutions depends on their ability to invest in their communities, in housing and other real estate. Mortgages now are sold in secondary markets, often in the form of mortgage-backed securities, where rates are pushed down by the market. The cost of funds is soaring because of those few &quot;high fliers&quot; who will pay anything to attract funding. As a result, the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; lender has a narrow spread between cost and rate of return. He has to generate income elsewhere; he has to use and trust his expertise to make some investments. As vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board I advocated 5% of assets of commercial banks; as a member of President Reagan's National Commission on Housing I tried to push the limit beyond 3% of assets. I still would.    To lay an Sandamp;L scandal at the feet of deregulation is a fairy tale of cause and effect. Mr. Mayer is ignoring the desperate need for expanding thrift powers. He is entangling the abuses of a few with the legitimate, compelling, continuing need for income for survival and growing net worth to protect depositors.    Brian Smith, on the other hand, in an article of the same day (&quot;Meanwhile, the Great Nonissue Is Nonbanks&quot;) hits that nail on the head by concluding, &quot;. . . the real issue is restructuring federal banking laws to enable banks to compete in a quickly changing financial marketplace.&quot; Add Sandamp;Ls. That has been my motivation in my various government capacities and it is my crusade today. I'm for vigorous examination and assets marked to market. I would, in fact, have added another culprit to Mr. Mayer's list: David Stockman, whose budgetary shortsightedness repeatedly prevented Chairman Edwin Gray from adequately expanding the examiner force of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Mr. Stockman hamstrung the surveillance of the go-go operators and the inept risk underwriters.    Let's not blame an entire industry or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for the sins and excesses of a small group or for poor management decisions. Rather, let's get on with the business of finding a rational, reformed financial-services structure for the 21st century and the system of depositor protections that must be structured in tandem.

San Francisco   ---   Federal law already exists to prohibit political contributions by federally chartered associations (Federal Election Campaign Act 1971, as amended, 2 U.S.C. Section 441b). Mr. Mayer's call for such a law calls into question his grasp of the issue.    Steven F. Rosenbaum   Executive Vice President   Prospect Federal Savings Bank   Lombard, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
