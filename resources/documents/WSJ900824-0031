The FDA study, being published today in the journalScience, should help dispel consumer concerns about thegenetically engineered product, bovine growth hormone, whichis injected into cows to boost milk production.</LP><TEXT>   FDA officials are intent on explaining why they authorizedthe sale of milk from BGH-treated cows in 1985 when theyapproved field tests of the hormone. BGH has yet to beapproved for commercial use.   The authors of the report say that analysis of more than120 studies has led the agency to conclude that use of BGHpresents &quot;no increased health risk to consumers.&quot;   In their report, Judith Juskevich, a former FDAtoxicologist and pharmacologist, and C. Greg Guyer, a chemistin the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, also citepreviously unpublished data from 16 studies underwritten bybiotechnology companies seeking FDA approval to beginmarketing BGH.   These data, among other things, show that BGH is harmlessbecause it breaks down into inactive fragments in thegastrointestinal tract while being digested, and thatpasteurization destroys 90% of the BGH in milk, according tothe scientists.   While the findings aren't surprising, the new study isunusual in several respects. &quot;It's unprecedented for the FDAto publish such an assessment of scientific data on a drugbefore it is approved,&quot; said Jeffrey Nesbit, chief spokesmanfor the FDA. Submitting data to peer review by a panel ofexperts -- in this instance, appointed by the editors ofScience -- is also unprecedented for the agency, he said.   BGH is one of the most promising products of recombinantDNA technology. Commercial batches can be produced bygenetically engineered bacteria for injection in cows twice amonth. In farm trials, milk yields have jumped 10% to 25%.BGH, also called bovine somatotropin, is biologicallyidentical to the natural growth hormone produced by the cow'spituitary gland.   Some consumer advocates and medical experts havequestioned the validity of the safety studies. As a result,some of the nation's largest milk processors and distributorshave backed away from BGH, refusing to handle milk fromBGH-treated herds. Nonetheless, Monsanto Co. and otherdevelopers of the synthetic hormone are still counting on a$500 million-a-year global market for BGH. Publication of theFDA study in a journal as prestigious as Science lendscredibility to their claims regarding the product's safety.   But the new study &quot;won't speed up or deter the approval ofBGH,&quot; Mr. Nesbit said. FDA clearance for commercial use isexpected sometime next year.</TEXT></DOC>
