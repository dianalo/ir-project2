All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-179-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthinessauthority of France, in accordance with existing provisions of a bilateralairworthiness agreement, has notified the FAA of an unsafe condition whichmay exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes. Therehave been reports of false electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM)warnings at Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) shutdown due to the susceptibilityof the standby transformer/rectifier (TR) to transitory electronic conditions.This condition, if not corrected, could result in unnecessary emergencyaction, such as an aborted takeoff.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A320-24-1028, dated July 7,1989, which describes procedures to replace the standby TR with a TR identicalto the main TR which is not susceptible to these conditions, and to relocateit to a position with improved ventilation. The relocation of the standbyTR is to provide the best environment for the proper operation of the standbyTR. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as mandatory.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require replacement and relocation of the TR in accordancewith the service bulletin previously described.It is estimated that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 5.5 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost wouldbe $40 per manhour. The required parts will be supplied by the manufacturerat no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impactof the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,760.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
