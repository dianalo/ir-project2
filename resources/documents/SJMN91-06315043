The city is considering a contribution of labor andmaterials to help pay the rest.;   There will be no way to keep non-residenthikers on the trail. In effect, the park will be open to anyone who can walk,bike or ride a horse. There has been little objection from the community;hikers are unlikely to bring coolers and boom boxes.;   But once the trail isdone, the discriminatory nature of the city's policy will become obvious. Thepark will be closed only to family picnickers, the handicapped, the elderlyand other non-hikers.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  204  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 10, 199100315043,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
