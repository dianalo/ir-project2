New York Telephone Co.'s bills, like those of the other operating companies, became so messy after deregulation that cartoonists got laughs by lampooning them. But it was no laughing matter to the company, a division of Nynex, whose research indicated that customers were confused and annoyed by bills that sometimes ran to more than 10 pages.    New York Telephone turned to Siegel andamp; Gale, a New York-based subsidiary of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, for a complete overhaul of the bill. Siegel andamp; Gale's staff includes linguists, systems analysts and writers -- in addition to designers.    The project took three years to complete, including research and discussions with state and local regulatory authorities. The result, now being phased in, is a shorter bill with the most important information -- how much is due and when -- at the top of the first page in large type.    The bill's organization has been improved. For instance, there's a new category, called &quot;Convenience Calls&quot;, for operator-assisted calls; these calls used to be spread throughout the bill.    Telephone jargon has been replaced with plain English. &quot;FCC line charge&quot; has become &quot;Charge for access to long-distance lines.&quot; And &quot;PSC funding per resolution M-4735&quot; becomes &quot;Funding to support Public Service Commission.&quot; (Clearer language isn't necessarily shorter.)    The bill also is designed in modules and printed electronically, by laser. This makes it easy to include each month only the modules that apply to each customer. For instance, if a customer adds a phone line, the next month's bill would include the charge in a module headed &quot;Added or Changed Service.&quot;    According to Siegel andamp; Gale chairman Alan Siegel, the new bill also should help New York Telephone. &quot;There will be significant reductions in paper, production and postage costs, plus fewer complaints and quicker payment,&quot; he predicts.    New Labs Are Designed   With User in Mind   RESEARCH LABS are undergoing a construction boom, with a new focus on the people who work in them.    New notions about how research fits into a corporation are influencing the design of laboratory facilities. Michael Landau, principal architectural designer at CUH2A, a Princeton, N.J., architecture and engineering firm, says, &quot;We're no longer looking at the lab as merely a place full of equipment, but at how people function there.&quot; He says clients want to consolidate research under one roof with marketing and engineering staffs. That should promote a team approach to developing new products.    Above all, he says, clients want laboratory spaces that will attract and retain talented researchers. So, he says more labs include small lounges and other informal meeting places because &quot;ideas can strike at any time, even during casual encounters with colleagues.&quot; And some labs now provide cubicles where scientists can write their reports, so they don't have to sit on a lab stool at a high counter.    Designers that specialize in Randamp;D facilities are finding plenty of work. Stuart Willson Jr., a partner in CUH2A, says, &quot;If a company is building anything today, it's likely to be Randamp;D space.&quot;    Electronic Figure Aids   Design for Elderly   ELDERLY RESIDENTS of St. Catherine's Village, a retirement facility under construction in Jackson, Miss., should find the kitchen cabinets easy to reach, thanks to a computerized manikin.    Older people present special challenges to designers who are building environments for them. The elderly tend to be smaller than the general population, and they often lack mobility. That means standard kitchen cabinetry, for example, shouldn't be used in a retirement community. But how do cabinet makers know the appropriate dimensions?    That's where E-Mann (for electronic manikin) comes in. Developed by Advanced Living Systems, a division of the Institute for Technology Development Inc., in Jackson, E-Mann is a human figure that simulates whatever human characteristics -- height, reach, joint flexibility and so on -- are fed into the computer.    For the St. Catherine's Village project, for example, designers plugged in data for the elderly. Then, working with computerized plans in the same scale as E-Mann, they could verify that all shelves, door pulls, faucets and other features would be operable.    Art Nelson, director of business development at Advanced Living Systems, says E-Mann was developed to help collect data on human movement under a grant from the National Institute on Disabled Rehabilitation Research. But he sees many other applications for the program -- for example, to design equipment that fully suited astronauts would use in space.    Odds andamp; Ends   THE BOBSLED designed by Ohio State University students for the U.S. two-man Olympic team and mentioned in this column last month, was disqualified after 10 preliminary runs. OSU officials say the judges ruled that the sled's rear bumper was too angular and might damage the track. . . . How the design process differs in the U.S., Europe and Japan is the subject of the Triad Design Project, a research effort being undertaken by the Design Management Institute and Harvard University's Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts and Business School. The first phase culminates next spring with identical exhibitions in Cambridge, Mass., and cities in Japan and West Germany. </TEXT></DOC>
