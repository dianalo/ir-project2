 Even the most highly customized orspecialized publishing systems are increasingly based on standard systemcomponents.andM;This trend shows no sign of abating.andP;  Over time, the foundation hardware andsoftware is getting better and better as the system developers build in moreand more of the functions and capabilities we need for publishingapplications.andM;Equally important, the move toward increasing use of standard componentsdoesn't stop at the system level.andP;  Mass-market, shrink-wrapped applicationsoftware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, increasingly capable andincreasingly able to cooperate with other shrink-wrapped applicationpackages.andP;  Even developers who want (or need) to put together more customizedtools have better and better budding blocks available.andP;  Softwarecompanies-from Deucalion Resources Group (the Tomahawk composition engine) toXyquest  (Xy-Write)-offer functional modules that can be incorporated intoother programs or systems.andM;Until recently, the one area that hasn't been adequately addressed either bystandard computer operating environments or by off-the-shelf applicationsoftware has been the very thing that stands at the heart of everyreasonable-sized multiuser publishing system: document and workflowmanagement.andP;  More than anything else, managing the publishing process is whata real, &quot;industrial strength' publishing system is aU about.andM;We were therefore very enthusiastic when we first began talking with Odestaabout its Odesta Document Management System (ODMS) software almost two yearsago.andP;  Not only was Odesta focusing on this all-important area, it was doingso from a fresh perspective that promised facilities and functionality we hadwanted for years, but had never gotten from dedicated multiuser publishingsystems.andM;We have watched the product from its introduction at the Seybold Conferencein September 1988 through more than a year of debugging, refinement andimplementation as Odesta worked to put it to practical use in an impressivevariety of real user applications.andP;  It is now far enough along that we cantake a closer look at what ODMS is, what it does and where it may fit in thepublishing system market.andM;What it is.andP;  In its current implementation, ODMS provides a databaseenvironment within which Macintosh-based publishing tasks can take place.andO;The package includes &quot;client&quot; software that runs in user Macintoshes anddocument management &quot;server&quot; software that runs in a host Macintosh or DECVMS Vax computer.andM;The database provides the &quot;glue&quot; to hold a multiuser publishing processtogether, and it brings with it the possibility of integrating a number oferstwhile standalone software packages into a coherent whole.andM;The question that ODMS forces us to confront is: can software from a varietyof vendors work together well enough to challenge the single-vendor approach?andO;Here, we provide the surprising answer: though there are areas in which theODMS approach is weak, there are also situations where it is likely to bebetter than any of the available single-vendor solutions.andM;ODMS has only a handful of users now.andP;  But there is sufficient seriouspublishing happening with it that customers of the traditional vendors can nolonger ignore Odesta's approach.andP;  The publishing world is changing, and ODMSrepresents the direction of the future.andM;How ODMS worksandM;The easiest way to begin a discussion of ODMS is by describing an actualapplication.andP;  A good application to start with is the Image Filer, theprototype of an ODMS product that will be sold as an OEM product by a scannermanufacturer.andP;  This is the first of what will probably be many ODMSapplications provided by Odesta on an OEM basis to other companies.andM;Image Filer, like other ODMS applications, is at heart a database-in thiscase, a database of pictures.andP;  Its basic function is to keep track of a largenumber of scanned images.andM;The fields.andP;  The database is a set of records describing a collection ofimages.andP;  There is a record for each image.andP;  As a default, each recordcontains the following fields: a unique record number, a department name, anowner name, a date of last use, a project name, a subject category, and an&quot;alert&quot; field (the name of the person who needs to be alerted when scanningis finished).andP;  AU these fields are indexed, meaning that data can beretrieved based on their contents without waiting for a sequential searchthrough all the records.andM;There are six more fields, which are not indexed: a description field, a filename, a creation date, a date of last modification, a field for the size ofthe image file, and a field indicating image type, such as PICT, Paint orTIFF.andM;Searching and reporting.andP;  As images are scanned, the image files themselvesand data about them are entered into the database.andP;  This allows a variety ofdatabase functions to be performed.andP;  Individual records can be retrievedbased on their contents.andP;  (For example,  Find the picture I scanned onTuesday for the 'annual report' project.&quot;) Standard reports of various kindscan be generated.andP;  (You could, for example, set up a monthly report showingthe number of scans and disk space used, by project.) And lists can begenerated based on ad hoc queries.andP;  (&quot;Show me a list of all images over 50KB.&quot;) The user can also add new fields and reports with great flexibility.andM;But these are standard database features.andP;  If this type of storage andretrieval were aU ODMS could do, it would be helpful but not remarkable.andP;  ButODMS does go farther.andP;  To this core of database software, it adds a set ofimportant tools.andP;  Launching other applications from the database.andP;  A keyaddition is the ability to start up other programs.andP;  Suppose, for example, ascanned image is brought into a retouching program such as ColorStudio.andP;  Thenext time the record for that image is brought onto the ODMS screen, therewill be a window showing the file with the ColorStudio icon, just as it wouldappear on the Mac desktop.andP;  Double-clicking on the icon will launchColorStudio and allow further retouching.andM;When the retouching work is done, the user exits ColorStudio in the normalway and ODMS resumes at the point where it had left off, reclaiming thechanged file as a new version.andP;  No switching from program to program isapparent.andP;  ODMS can work in this way with any Mac application.andM;Launching other applications from ODMS has a couple of virtues.andP;  It makes iteasy to combine the database work and the other application: the operatorfamiliar with the Mac works in a familiar way, without special concessions tothe database.andP;  It also lets some database fields get filled in automatically.andO;In the Image Filer application, all of the following are filled inautomatically: time of creation, time of last modification, size, type anddate of last use.andM;Most of these fields get their initial values automatically when a file isimported from the desktop, which is a primary way of bringing a file intoODMS.andM;When the user double-cheks to launch a file in ODMS, the process is not thesame as when an individual Mac user launches a local process.andP;  The differenceis that, in the ODMS case, the file involved is not a file at aU as far asthe Mac is concerned: it is a field in a database residing in a serverelsewhere on the network.andP;  The field must be retrieved from the server andturned into a local file in order for the application to run.andP;  Thisdistinction is not apparent to the user, however.andP;  Image file in a field.andO;The file created by the scanning process can itself be stored as a in theODMS record.andP;  Since ODMS does not place restrictions on the type or length ofdata in a database field, the image file can be copied out of the Macintoshfiling system and into the database.andP;  Scanned images are stored in this wayin the Image Filer package.andM;Alternatively, for some applications it makes sense just to store the data inan external file on the server.andP;  ODMS can work that way too.andM;Thumbnail images.andP;  ODMS can create screen-resolution display files fromstored graphics.andP;  At this writing, PICT1, PICT2, PAINT, and EPS files aresupported.andP;  TIFF support is due soon.) The result is that quick browsingthrough thumbnail images is supported without launching another application.andO;Without this feature, the database would give you information about thepictures, but wouldn't let you see them.andP;  This is important because it letsyou make sure you have the right picture before you launch acolor-separation, paint or publishing program.andM;(Though not important in this image-filing application, ODMS can also previewthe first page of a text file without invoking a word processing or desktoppublishing program.)andM;As a network application.andP;  A final, critical feature is that ODMS works overnetworks.andP;  (The details of this are covered later, but basically there mustbe a Mac II or Vax computer acting as a server.) In the network environment,ODMS can coordinate the work of many different people.andP;  In the Image Filerapplication, it could be that the person who will use the image is not theperson doing the scanning.andP;  These two people could be working at differentMacintoshes on the network.andP;  The Image Filer application would enable theimage user to see what images were ready for his or her attention.andM;Other applications.andP;  Among ODMS's initial base of a dozen or so users, theproduct is being used in a wide variety of ways.andP;  It is being used as ashop-management system by a specialty calendar printer.andP;  A large colorprinter is using it for in-house job tracking and is providing it tocustomers using desktop programs as well.andP;  The New York Daily News ismanaging the pagination of its weekly Travel section with ODMS.andP;  DigitalReview is also using it to manage workflow.andP;  Two defense contractors areusing it to manage their proposal-writing processes.andP;  Another is using it tomanage procurement.andP;  An airline is managing the maintenance of its fleet viaODMS.andP;  An accounting firm uses it to manage die production of reports, and alegal firm manages legal documents with it.andP;  NASA is using it for a technicaldocumentation application.andM;These applications, several of which will be discussed later, show the rangeof tasks for which ODMS may be employed.andP;  And these are surely just thebeginning.andP;  We expect that there would be a role for ODMS or an equivalentcapability in most applications involving ten or more people in a processwhose major thrust is the production of documents or other printed products.andM;Helix: the core technology of ODMS The core of ODMS is a database.andP;  Indeed,one way of looking at ODMS is as an extension of Odesta's Helix databaseproducts (Double Helix III for the Mac and Helix VMX for the Vax).andM;How good a foundation is the Helix database capability? After spending sometime with Double Helix on the Mac, we give it high marks as a tool forpublishing applications.andP;  It is as easy to use as any Mac database package(and easier, we would say, than most PC packages), and it has a lot of power.andM;The mouse-and-icon interface hides a database approach that is very much inline with standard relational database concepts.andP;  You have sets of records,each composed of fields.andP;  A set of records of identical layout is called arelation.' (This corresponds with formal database terminology, but users ofPC database products may be used to thinking of it as a  file.&quot;) Severalrelations can be linked via fields they have in common (formally, arelational &quot;join&quot;).andP;  Together, they form a database, or, in Odesta'sterminology, a  collection.'andM;Setting up a collection is very easy and highly visual.andP;  It involves workingwith icons that represent various tools.andP;  The primary ones are the relationicon (for laying out records), the field icon (for creating fields), thetemplate icon (for establishing the format of data-entry forms and reports),the abacus icon (for calculations on fields), and the query icon (forretrieving selected records).andM;We like the way the tools are implemented, with the exception of the abacusicon.andP;  The abacus's pictorial approach to specifying computations has littleadvantage, we think, and it has the major disadvantage that complicatedexpressions take up vast amounts of screen space for what might otherwise bea single line of alphanumerics.andP;  But Odesta tens us many of its users areenthusiastic supporters of the approach.andM;It is certainly easy to set up a database in Double Helix.andP;  We note, though,that a lot of disciplined thought still must go into the design of thedatabase.andP;  For it is just as easy in Double Helix to set up a databasestructure that will turn out to be a mismatch for the application as it is toset up the correct structure.andP;  In other words, the execution may be easy, butthere is always some hard mental work to do.andM;Double Helix has a particularly strong implementation of custom menus,submenus and menu shortcuts.andP;  The menus can be tailored to individual users,and they can provide selective access to only those functions that a specificuser needs.andM;One of the attractive features of Double Helix is the variable length of itsfields.andP;  While you can specify what part of a field is displayed on thescreen or in reports, there is no actual restriction on the field lengthexcept an overall maximum of 32 KB per field.andP;  The program allocates only asmuch disk space as there is data.andP;  This variability is important for storingtext files and image files, which are typically variable in length.andP;  Thereare some applications in which the maximum of 32 KB per field could proveburdensome.andP;  But in the world of ordinary database products, 32 KB per fieldis as near infinite as you need.andP;  (Not so in publishing, though, so ODMS doesnot have this limit-see below.)andM;A key feature for some environments is the multiuser, client/server-basednetworking approach.andP;  In small networks, a Macintosh can act as server.andP;  Inlarge ones, the server would be a Vax.andM;We note with disappointment that Double Helix doesn't automatically handlethe printing of labels (or other database output) in &quot;3-up&quot; or &quot;4-up&quot; format.andO;In printing, each record's data will normally be formatted below thepreceding one.andP;  A special routine must be written to handle label printing.andO;But this is of little consequence for publishing applications.andP;  Beyond Helix:what else is there in ODMS? The Helix technology is the base for ODMS, butODMS extends it in several ways.andP;  These extensions provide ODMS with some ofits key features.andM;For dealing with large files  these may be of any kind, including image data)there is a facility for handling files of unlimited length in a databasefield (unlike the Helix limit of 32 KB per field).andP;  There is also a mechanismfor previewing images and text without opening an application program.andM;Special tools for setting up logons and passwords can be used to controlaccess to various processes and parts of the database.andP;  People with relatedjob functions can be grouped together and the groups can be given names.andO;Then, access rights can be granted on a group as well as an individual basis.andM;Automation of workflow is also based on logon names.andP;  The steps through whicha given type of document or project must flow are entered into a list ofstages.andP;  Each stage gets an identification number, and then a table is set upthat tells which step is next under a given set of circumstances.andP;  Forexample, a project could go on to the next step if it had been approved, butback to a previous one if it had not.andM;Sublaunching an application via an icon in a window within ODMS is a key tomaking it easy to use.andP;  Odesta wants ODMS to be built into the way peoplework-otherwise, they might have to key things twice, or they might not takethe time to update the database after each step they finish.andM;ODMS has special tools for keeping track of file names and versions.andP;  This isimportant in applications that need an audit trail.andP;  It also helps avoid theproblem, so common in multicomputer environments, of deciding which versionof a document is 'current.&quot; Related software for archiving can remove filesfrom active storage (transferring them perhaps to tape) after auser-specified period of inactivity.andP;  But their locations on tape are stilltracked in case they are needed again.andM;ODMS has the ability to  time-stamp&quot; documents when they are saved to thedatabase, which is important for collecting productivity and billinginformation.andP;  A trail of comments, each carrying the time and die logon nameof the source, can also be stored in the document's record.andM;Finally, Odesta has added to ODMS an outlining capability.andP;  This will beimportant for highly structured applications, such as documentation.andP;  Theoutline facilities can help to manage the document creation process, and theycan be used to assemble the document for formatting and output at any stagein its development.andM;These enhancements, modest though some of them seem individually, make ODMSfar more than  just another database package.&quot; They move ODMS into a categoryby itself as a publishing tool.andM;The hardware and software platformsandM;ODMS will work with a limited range of hardware and software, but new itemsare gradually being added to the list.andP;  Here is how it stands at the moment.andM;Server: Vax, maybe Mac.andP;  ODMS is a network application.andP;  But it won't work onevery type of network.andP;  If you already have a network in place  especiallyone that is not all Macintoshes), you may not be able to use much of what youalready have.andM;The network must use Ethernet or LocalTalk cabling.andP;  (Relatively few networksdesigned around IBM-compatible computers would have either of these.) Youmust use either a Mac II or a DEC Vax running VMS as a server.andP;  Most ODMSsites so far use a Vax.andM;These restrictions mean that PC-oriented sites considering ODMS frequentlywill not be able to use their existing networks, even after Odesta introducesPC support.andP;  In particular, networks built around products from companieslike Novell, 3Com and Banyan will need a new server at the very least.andO;Unless Ethernet cabling has been used, it is likely that the network willneed to be rewired and new interface boards provided for the workstations.andO;These changes alone could cost $1,000 per PC-a signicant impediment to theadoption of ODMS.andM;By contrast, sites that have standardized on networked Macs or Vaxes for mostof their work will probably be able to use ODMS with little or no additionalhardware.andM;Workstations.andP;  The workstation of choice for ODMS is the Macintosh.andP;  If youwant to launch other applications (and most ODMS sites need this capability),you have to run Multi-Finder.andP;  This requirement, plus the needs of ODMSitself, suggest the use of a machine with 2-4 MB of memory.andM;Though Vax sites can use their VT-100 terminals with ODMS, there arelimitations.andP;  Only with die Mac do you get the full power of the integrationbetween ODMS and die Macintosh interface (icons, mouse clicks and so on).andM;Odesta is also committed to developing a way to support IBM-compatible PCs inODMS.andP;  There is no specific delivery date for this, however, and many of thespecifics have yet to be decided.andP;  Because of the uncertainties surroundingPC support, we suggest that potential customers think of ODMS as a Mac-onlyproduct for the time being.andP;  Once Odesta announces the timing and features ofthe PC interface, it will be possible to consider the value of ODMS in aPC-oriented environment.andM;Interfaces to Unix workstations will be developed, but here also thespecifics have yet to be announced.andM;User feedbackandM;The ODMS user base is at about 30 sites now, although many of these are veryrecent installations.andP;  Some of the early ODMS users were unwilling to benamed or quoted publicly.andP;  But four key sites were willing to share theirexperiences with us.andP;  They are probably representative of the collectiveexperience so far.andM;Quad/Graphics.andP;  Quad/Graphics, a large color printer in Pewaukee, Wisconsin,was one of the firms that prompted Odesta to develop ODMS.andP;  One wing of thecompany, Quad/Text, was developing ways for clients to submit files of textand graphics electronically.andP;  Alan Darling, general manager of Quad/Text, sawa need for electronic file management and production control.andP;  The need wasnot just within Quad/Text, but also within the clientorganizations-magazines, catalog publishers and others-that Quad/Text served.andM;Darling had tried a Vax-based Macintosh file-sharing scheme, but he wanteddatabase characteristics as well.andP;  He looked at Helix VMX and saw itspromise, but he also saw that something would have to be done about the 32 KBlimit on field length.andP;  He asked Odesta what could be done to change things,and that was a major impetus for the development of ODMS.andM;Quad/Text has been in the thick of ODMS development ever since.andP;  Quad/Texthas a fill-time person working on ODMS development, and every month or so,Odesta receives for testing the latest version of the Quad/Text system.andM;Though the system has not yet been installed at client sites, Darling feelsthat the software is just about ready for that.andP;  Clients will receive asystem for the handling of &quot;electronic job envelopes,&quot; which they can workwith internally and eventually pass on to Quad/Text for final production.andO;The system can be tailored to the work flow of the particular client.andM;Each site will have a network of Macintoshes and a file server (usually a Vax3300).andP;  Pages will be made up in Visionary, the Scitex version of QuarkXpress.andP;  Quad/Text provides the Visionary software and the fill Bitstreamfont library as part of the system, which is called ADEPT.andM;Many of the clients already have the Macs and the Visionary software, andsome already have the Vax as well (at present, for use as a simple fileserver).andP;  Some of them are quite anxious, Darling says, to get the ODMSproduction control software too.andP;  But he is holding off until he isabsolutely certain the software will not encounter problems in the field.andM;New York Daily News.andP;  The New York Daily News is another of the ODMSpioneers.andP;  The paper had looked around for its next system (to replace anaging Atex) and had not found what it wanted.andP;  Mike Pearson, director oftechnical services at the Daily News, told us that the available solutionsfrom the traditional vendors didn't do all the Daily News wanted, and theywere fearfully expensive.andP;  The paper didn't want to make an enormousfinancial commitment to a single vendor based on promises of futurefunctionality.andM;On the other hand, Pearson said, the new crop of composition packages runningon small machines, intriguing though they were, didn't have the filemanagement and multiuser tools that the paper needed.andP;  But Odesta seemed tohave an answer.andP;  The Daily News decided to try ODMS, using Quark Xpress forcomposition.andP;  It was risky, but so was the single-vendor alternative.andM;Based on the paper's requirements, Odesta put together a complex system.andP;  Itis being tested on the paper's weekly &quot;Travel&quot; section.andP;  The page takes shapeinitially in Layout 8000, the automatic ad layout program from SoftwareConsulting Services.andP;  The page layouts are passed to ODMS by a piece ofsoftware developed by SCS (a Quark Xtension).andP;  Ads are placed on the pagefrom within ODMS, using Quark.andP;  Camera-ready ads are scanned; other ads aremade up with Multi-Ad Creator.andM;A separate workflow controls the editorial portion of the page.andP;  Stories,heads and captions are written on the Atex system.andP;  (Atex composition,though, is not used except as a depth-estimation tool.) The text materialsare then transferred to ODMS either by a program supplied by SCS or by onedeveloped in-house.andP;  (There is still software work to be done, Pearson says,to get all the data about the story over to ODMS.) Stories are assigned tospecific editions or are kept as fillers for use when needed.andM;A budget listing of available stories and photos is produced.andP;  At aneditorial budget meeting, all the stories and photos for a given edition areassigned pages.andP;  Then, a  design editor' places them on the page using Quarkvia ODMS.andP;  The completed page is then ready for output.andM;So far, the system is not in five use.andP;  It is only being used to producecopies of sections that have already been published in the usual way.andP;  ButPearson tells us that virtually aU the technical problems have been workedout, and now it is a matter of working out the new job-related issues thatsurface with the new approach.andM;If the system can be successfully used with the Travel section, it win beexpanded to other nondeadline sections.andP;  Eventually, it will be used fordeadline news as well.andP;  Some.andP;  parts of the paper (a notable example issports agate) are difficult to do with Quark, so they will continue to bedone conventionally until better tools come along.andM;The Daily News gave up some potential integration (such as the ability towrite to fit) when it went with ODMS instead of a single-vendor solution.andO;But Pearson is happy with the trade-off.andP;  The flexibility of ODMS and itsability to make use of whatever new technology becomes available are wellworth some loss of integration.andM;Pearson is enthusiastic about ODMS.andP;  He said he was surprised at the speedwith which the Daily News application was developed, once the paper hadsettled on the specifications.andP;  He also noted that he had expected softwarebugs because of the newness of ODMS, but few actually materialized.andM;Advertising Unlimited, Inc. Advertising Unlimited, Inc. (AUI) is located inthe out-of-the-way hamlet of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota.andP;  Nevertheless, it is thecountry's largest producer of specialty calendars.andP;  If you have gottencalendars from your insurance agent or broker, you know the type of product.andM;The nature of the business means that AUI has a major peak in its workloadeach fall.andP;  During peak season, the company works three shifts handling 4,000orders a week.andP;  ODMS is used in the part of the operation that handles thecreation of the ads and personalizations that appear on the calendars.andM;Until the summer of 1989, this work had been handled by a Quadex systemdriving a Compugraphic 9600.andP;  But die Quadex had trouble coping with thepeaks and didn't deal well with the need to store a database of jobs fromyear to year.andP;  Nor did it seem likely to be able to handle the large volumesof electronic graphics AUI was planning to use.andM;ODMS was selected as a successor to the Quadex system.andP;  AUI now has 15Macintoshes and a Vax file server in its network.andP;  Quark is being used forcomposition, and Multi-Ad Creator is also being tested.andM;Line art is incorporated directly into the page.andP;  Art submitted by thecustomer is scanned on one of two Travel scanners.andP;  It is run through AdobeStreamline (to convert it into outline format) and then cleaned up inIllustrator '88 or FreeHand.andP;  After use, it is stored electronically.andP;  Thisprocess is gradually replacing a manual procedure involving a huge film-fileroom where art was stored, and a process involving keylining and eitherpaste-up or film stripping to combine the art and type.andM;The tracking and job-management functions have been a great boon, accordingto Julie Hermanson, who manages the operation.andP;  It's easy to check the jobstatus when a customer calls, and to generate reports on almost any aspect ofthe operation.andP;  These were real problems under the old system.andM;Hermanson got her job at almost the same time as die ODMS system wasinstalled.andP;  The decision to purchase it was made by her predecessor.andP;  Partlyas a consequence of this change in personnel, AUI had less of a hand in theimplementation of the system than most ODMS users.andP;  It let Odesta analyze itsoperation and come up with a solution.andM;But Hermanson recommends that people installing ODMS learn to customize it,and AUI is currently going through training to be able to do that.andP;  So far,though, the system is running exactly as it was delivered by Odesta.andM;AUI encountered performance problems with ODMS (as have some other users) andlooked to Odesta for help.andP;  The problems were corrected by software changes(and Odesta is continuing to improve the performance of its software,especially (the Vax portion of it) and by learning how to avoid databasequeries that would tie up the system unnecessarily.andM;Hermanson is pleased with the ODMS system now.andP;  She made it through the peakseason successfully, and it was a season of record volume for AUI because ithad acquired another calendar company.andP;  She recommends ODMS to other users,especially those that, like AUI, need a standing database of jobs that mayrepeat year after year.andM;General Dynamics.andP;  The Convair division of General Dynamics is a largegovernment contractor.andP;  A key part of its business is the production ofproposals that describe the products it proposes to build.andP;  Each proposal isdeveloped in response to a governmental Request for Proposal (RFP).andP;  Eachelement of the RFP must the addressed somewhere in the proposal, andproposals are often developed by groups of people working in parallel on veryshort deadlines.andP;  It is a demanding type of publishing, and one with littlemargin for error.andM;ODMS is a good match for this type of environment.andP;  We talked with Dr.andO;Richard Brusch about the &quot;Proposal Communication System' his group developedbased on ODMS.andP;  The key tasks are keeping things on schedule and making sureall the requirements of the RFP are met.andP;  The latter task is handled througha &quot;requirements allocation&quot; process, which divides the requirements listed inthe RFP among the various sections and authors of the proposal.andP;  The formertask is handled by setting up a schedule using MacProject and transferringthe schedule to ODMS, where it becomes the basis for finding out whether eachpart of the proposal is on time.andM;Each time a file is saved in ODMS, the author is asked to estimate thepercentage of completion.andP;  When the author responds with &quot;100%,&quot; the file(which corresponds to one piece of the proposal) is passed on to a reviewer.andO;This results in a continuous review process, with different parts of theproposal getting reviewed as soon as they are ready.andM;This contrasts with the previous method, which involved reviews of the entireproposal at specific  epochs,&quot; a less satisfactory approach.andP;  Also, trackingin ODMS replaces a cumbersome paper tracking system and a &quot;sneaker net,method of carrying files from one participant in the process to another.andM;Dr.andP;  Brusch is very pleased with ODMS, but he also has a wish list ofenhancements.andP;  Like some other users, he has encountered Vax-relatedbottlenecks, and he is looking forward to speed improvements that are comingin the next ODMS release.andP;  Most of his people work on Macs, and they are wellsupported, but he also needs PC support and in the future will need supportfor Unix workstations from various vendors.andM;He also laments the fact that only one workstation can design or enhance anODMS application at a time.andP;  He had three full-time developers during theearly stages of ODMS work, and two of them could not work directly on the&quot;live&quot; version of ODMS.andP;  They had to develop their enhancements on dummyversions of the software, check them out, and then carefully implement themagain on the five copy.andM;On the other hand, Brusch and several other users are quick to praise thespeed with which ODMS applications can be developed.andP;  General Dynamics wasable to develop its system-which contains 600 different screen layouts-infour months with just three people.andP;  Brusch believes it would have takenthree times as long with most other database pacandM;ODMS vs.andP;  traditional publishing systemsandM;It is difficult to find a slot for ODMS in the usual categories of publishingsystems.andP;  Its closest relatives are the job-tracking systems used incommercial printing and  Wetting operations and the classified-ad systemsused in newspapers.andP;  But it is not very similar to these special-purposesystems.andP;  We are forced to conclude that ODMS is the first of a new category.andO;Odesta's own phrase, Document Management System, is an apt description ofthis new class of software.andP;  We would propose going one step farther andcalling a system of this type a 'publishing management system' sincepublishing activities, as well as the documents themselves, are subject tomanagement.andM;Since there are no other obvious candidates for  publishing managementsystem&quot; software, it is difficult to compare ODMS with other approaches topublishing.andP;  (There may be other competitors quite soon-see the next articlein this issue.) We think most ODMS prospects have already concluded thatstandalone copies of several different software packages will not solve theirpublishing problems.andP;  They are organizations that are too large or complexfor that type of solution.andP;  Instead, they would be likely to compare ODMS,combined with two or three standalone programs, with a single-vendorsolution.andP;  What are the virtues and failings of each approach?andM;ODMS advantages.andP;  ODMS has several advantages.andP;  One is freedom of softwareselection.andP;  If you buy document management from Odesta, you can buycomposition from someone else, editing from a third party, and so on.andP;  Youare not stuck with the tools offered by a single vendor, and you don't haveto wait for your vendor to incorporate new technologies or new approachesbefore you can take advantage of them.andM;Another advantage is customizability.andP;  ODMS is designed to be tailored to theenvironment.andP;  You don't need to run your business in a certain way to have itwork well with ODMS.andP;  You can control how your operation is set up.andP;  It isalso easy to modify ODMS as the need arises.andM;Cost could be another advantage, although, since you do not buy documentmanagement separately in a single-vendor system, it is hard to specify whatthe cost savings really are.andP;  Advantages of single-vendor solutions.andO;Single-vendor solutions have advantages too, of course.andP;  Primary among theseis having a single point of responsibility for integration and support.andO;Identifying the source of a problem in a system composed of several vendors'software and hardware can be a frustrating experience, especially for peoplewithout strong computer backgrounds.andM;And once the source of the problem is identified, it still may not be easy toget it fixed.andP;  Odesta and its VARs (value-added resellers) may provide thisservice to some extent, but they will not be in a position to do much aboutproblems in composition software and other non-Odesta elements of a system.andM;Single-vendor solutions may have better integration than a multivendorODMS-based system.andP;  For example, you might have editors using Microsoft Wordunder ODMS.andP;  It is not possible to have editors writing precisely to fit inWord if Quark will be used for final composition.andP;  The line endings willinevitably be different.andP;  But there are a number of single-vendor systemsthat let editors get precise line endings without having to work withcomposition software.andM;Sometimes a single-vendor system needs less on-site expertise.andP;  If yourpublishing activities are a good match for the way the system was designed,chances are you can get a system installed and running without a great dealof in-house computer know-how.andP;  In particular, working out the details of thestructure of the database, required for ODMS, would not be necessary.andP;  (Inthe future, Odesta VARs may help with this process.)andM;Odesta and its strategyandM;Odesta is a company in the throes of change.andP;  It built its success so far onstandalone applications for the Macintosh, but it is betting its future ongroup-oriented software for networks.andM;The company was founded in 1982 by Daniel Cheifetz.andP;  One of the earliestdevelopers for the Macintosh, Odesta introduced its first product, Helix, inFebruary 1984.andP;  Helix evolved into a family of database products.andP;  These nowinclude Double Helix III, the current Mac product, and Helix VMX for the Vax(announced in October 1986).andP;  Odesta and DEC announced a cooperativeagreement in 1987 involving the development and promotion of Helix VMX.andM;The year 1988 was full of important announcements.andP;  Odesta obtained marketingrights to DataDesk and GeoQuery in the spring of that year (both weredeveloped elsewhere).andP;  And in September, at the Seybold Conference, ODMS wasannounced.andM;Over the year and a half since the announcement of ODMS, Odesta has focusedincreasingly on that product.andP;  Working closely with the initial sites, it hasironed out bugs and improved features.andP;  Odesta has also spent a lot of timejust understanding the needs of the customers.andP;  The company is working with alimited number of initial ODMS installations, and devoting considerableattention to them, in order to prepare for the marketing and support problemsthat offering a product as complex as ODMS broadly will raise.andM;On the business side of the house, Odesta is also laying the groundwork forthe future.andP;  Founder Cheifetz recently turned the financial reins over to anew CEO, David Rubin.andP;  Rubin is strong in financial management, having at onetime been vice president and coo of the Midwest Stock Exchange.andP;  Odesta willnot discuss its future financial plans, but we note that a person with astrong financial background is often brought in when a company is preparingto raise venture capital or to offer stock.andM;Daniel Cheifetz likes to emphasize the point that, while otherpublishing-oriented products have mostly grown out of very specificapplications, ODMS has been developed based on careful but generalconsideration of how people and organizations function.andP;  In manyorganizations, Cheifetz says, &quot;people's work now consists of digitaldocuments.andP;  Basically, managing the process is an information managementissue.&quot; It is not unlike managing data for any other application, except thatthe data is not &quot;Number of items sold&quot; but text files, image files andpage-layout files.andP;  For many environments, just moving data from one folderor directory to another-the only management method available in manyelectronic publishing applications-is not an adequate management tool.andM;In Cheifetz's view, Odesta is in business to help people answer threequestions: What's going on? What does it mean? What should we do about it?andM;A database product like Helix can provide the facts that describe what'sgoing on.andP;  An analysis program like GeoQuery or DataDesk can help provide anunderstanding of what the data means.andP;  But the third question (what should bedone about it) generally requires thought and often group decision-making.andO;For this, Odesta can provide only facilities for sharing information (throughnetworking) and communicating decisions (through message-handling).andP;  ODMSprovides the &quot;transport mechanism&quot; for the information sharing and messaging.andM;While Cheifetz wants to continue to develop and support all the Odestaproducts, he believes the company's future lies with ODMS.andP;  StandaloneMacintosh programs can address a certain set of applications in companies ofa certain size.andP;  Beyond these limits, multiuser software is needed.andP;  This hasbeen the traditional territory of minicomputers and mainframes, but Cheifetzsees it opening up to networks that integrate microcomputers, and he wantsOdesta to be at the forefront of this movement, with ODMS as the key product.andM;Marketing ODMSandM;With ODMS, Odesta faces some major marketing hurdles.andP;  Most sales of Odesta'sother products have been through normal Macintosh retail channels.andP;  Thatwon't work for ODMS; it isn't reasonable to ask large numbers of end users tohandle the networking and integration issues that ODMS entails.andM;Odesta's first cut at addressing this problem is to focus on the developmentof a network of VARs from whom end users would purchase ODMS.andP;  Odesta beganmeeting with prospective VARs in September.andP;  Until the VAR organization is inplace, Odesta will install and support users directly.andP;  This direct contactwill also give the company enough field experience to put together a good VARtraining program.andP;  (Within the last few weeks, Odesta began holding the firstround of training sessions for VARs.)andM;Many VARs are expected to focus on specific vertical markets fields theyalready know well.andP;  This will allow them to provide versions of ODMS thathave already been tailored to an industry, with the opportunity for moretailoring to fit the needs of the specific site.andM;The lack of application-specific tailoring in &quot;plain&quot; ODMS is both a strength(in that nothing is prejudged) and a weakness in that each new applicationhas to be set up from scratch).andP;  Through the VAR channel, Odesta hopes to addthe industry-specific knowledge that is not built into ODMS.andM;Another marketing channel Odesta has already begun to use is the OEM channel.andO;Specialized versions of ODMS will be sold bundled with other vendors'products.andP;  The Image Filer image-management system mentioned earlier in thisarticle is the first example of this: it will be offered by a scanner vendorlater this spring.andM;Will any of the current crop of system vendors that populate the high end ofthe publishing market incorporate ODMS as part of their system offerings? Theonly vendor doing anything along those lines so far is DEC. DEC is activelyinvolved with ODMS, demonstrating it at trade shows and incorporating it inits advertising, and this relationship has already resulted in joint selling.andM;Eventually, Odesta may also offer &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; versions of ODMS tailoredfor very specific applications.andP;  These would be set up to meet the needs of amajority of users in a given type of publishing or document-handlingenvironment.andP;  Some customization would also be possible, though not as muchas with full ODMS.andP;  Also, a retail version of &quot;generic&quot; ODMS is beingplanned.andM;SupportandM;Odesta's decision to focus on VAR and OEM channels will simplify support.andO;Aside from the small number of early direct customers, ODMS users will lookto the VAR or OEM for support.andP;  Odesta's support task then becomes primarilytraining and supporting the VARs and OEMs-a much easier task than supportinglarge numbers of end users.andM;Documentation for ODMS is a challenge, since the system that the end userwill see may be unique to a particular site.andP;  Odesta has begun to tackle theproblem by writing manuals that relate to a particular industry.andP;  The manualfor newspapers and magazines, which is almost in final form, is a case inpoint.andP;  It is well written and clear (as are the manuals of Odesta's otherproducts), but it is so closely tied to the newspaper workflow and job titlesof the New York Daily News that it will need substantial revision before itcan be used elsewhere.andP;  We expect that the VAR network will have to play asignificant role in developing documentation tailored to specific industries.andM;Development and futuresandM;Odesta is geared to add staff as ODMS evolves.andP;  When we visited Odesta'ssuburban Chicago offices Oust before Christmas, with a wind chill of  50[degrees] F), we saw a large new area that had just been opened up foroffices for Randamp;D staff.andP;  The staff will have plenty to do.andM;Interfacing.andP;  Earlier in the article, we mentioned porting the serversoftware to Unix, and the eventual support of PCs.andP;  Also in the works isimproved communication with mainframes, on which data needed by ODMS mightreside.andM;ODMS will eventually interface with databases on a variety of platforms,including database packages that compete with Helix.andP;  Why? Odesta must beable to sell ODMS to customers who already have a deep commitment to otherdatabase approaches.andM;In fact, Daniel Cheifetz tells us, Odesta does not view itself as a vendor ofa database product but as a vendor of data management tools.andP;  The Helixproducts were developed because that was the only way to get the rightdatabase for the tasks Odesta wanted to support.andP;  But other products areavailable now and Odesta will interface to them.andM;Odesta also sees the need for mixed systems, where some data is handledwithin ODMS and some is extracted from (or posted to) outside databases ofvarious kinds.andP;  For example, Odesta is building an interface to DEC's RDBdatabase facility.andP;  And RDB, in turn, has the ability to interface to avariety of other database environments (IBM's DB/2, for example).andP;  So throughthis mechanism, ODMS could interact with data that was managed on an IBMmainframe in DB/2.andM;PC support.andP;  Odesta is pledged to support DOS-compatible PCs under ODMS.andO;Indeed, without such support, many organizations would dismiss ODMS out ofhand, so great is their existing installed base of PCs.andP;  But the date ofavailability of PC support is unknown, and quite a few other issues remain tobe settled.andP;  Will the product work with any PC running DOS, or will Windowsbe required? Or even perhaps os/2? What limitations on functionality(compared with the Mac version) will there be? There are no answers yet.andM;Unix.andP;  The Vax server that supports most ODMS networks runs VMS, DECsproprietary operating system for the Vax.andP;  But Odesta has encounteredinterest from people whose networks are Unix-based, so a Unix version isbeing developed.andP;  Besides reducing ODMS's reliance on proprietary DECsoftware, the Unix version would make it possible to consider server hardwarefrom a wide variety of vendors.andM;A Unix version of ODMS would have another benefit: synergy with other Unixapplications.andP;  The kinds of file and application integration that occur inthe Mac world could also occur in the Unix world, with equally beneficialresults.andM;Workstations.andP;  Odesta plans to support Unix workstations such as those fromDigital and Sun.andP;  The company is basing that development on the X Windowwindowing standard, and will soon make a program announcement with Digital todeliver a DECwindows ODMS  client&quot; for VMS and Unix/Ultrix workstations.andM;Mail.andP;  While the ODMS database itself can be used to set up a basicelectronic messaging system (as some ODMS sites have already done), thisfacility is of no use in an organization where messages must be exchangedwith people who are not ODMS users.andP;  This need has prompted Odesta to beginwork on a link to electronic mail systems.andM;ODMS will link to systems that use the X-400 standard for electronic mailmessages.andP;  ODMS itself will be able to generate such messages when specificconditions are met.andP;  For example, notification of the completion of a taskcould be automatically sent to a user outside of the ODMS domain.andM;Full-text search.andP;  ODMS does not really support full-text search (also knownas &quot;content-based retrieval&quot;).andP;  For some applications, it must be possible tomake a request like &quot;show me all the paragraphs that contain both  drugs' andCIA'.' That kind of query is not appropriate for ODMS, which does not keep anindex of aU the words in the text files it is managing.andM;The solution is to integrate full-text searching software from other vendorsinto ODMS.andP;  Though this has not yet been done, Odesta plans to do it.andP;  And,as with other types of application software, it will be done in such a waythat the ODMS user can select any of several different packages fromdifferent vendors.andM;PricingandM;ODMS pricing is based on the size of the server and the number of usersinvolved.andP;  The server cost ranges from $25,000 to $150,000 depending onconfiguration, and the cost per workstation is between $500 and $1,500.andP;  Ontop of this must be added the cost of having Odesta or a VAP, customize ODMSto fit the application (except in relatively rare cases where the end-userwill take on this task).andP;  This cost varies widely, but would typically be inthe range of $15,000 to $100,000.andM;ConclusionsandM;ODMS is a unique and powerful piece of software.andP;  It solves the dilemma facedby those who want the flexibility of selecting among various programs andpieces of hardware but who still want an integrated, coordinated solution totheir publishing problems.andP;  And it provides the last major piece of thepuzzle for those who want a multivendor, &quot;fourth-wave&quot; solution tolarge-scale publishing: it provides a flexible mechanism for controllingworkflow and tracking job status.andM;ODMS can (and will) be used in a variety of ways:andM;* Sophisticated end users can employ the tools to develop their own documentmanagement system.andP;  To facilitate this process, Odesta intends to sellversions of ODMS preconfigured to provide the base functionality forparticular kinds of applications.andP;  It has deliberately chosen to work with awide variety of early users and plans to incorporate the lessons learned fromthe early users in specific versions of the product.andM;* People who have a good understanding of a particular application willprobably develop ODMS implementations to sell to end users.andP;  There is a wholeindustry of people who develop and market customer-specific orvertical-market dbase applications running on PCs.andP;  The same sort of thingcould happen here.andM;* System integrators may decide to base the file management portions of theirapplication solutions on ODMS.andM;* Computer systems vendors could offer ODMS or ODMS like capabilities as partof their system software.andP;  Ultimately, this is probably where really goodgeneral-purpose document management facilities really belong.)andM;No matter which approach you take, the emergence of software like ODMS willalmost certainly affect the thinking of a lot of people in a lot ofpublishing applications.andM;Strengths and weaknesses.andP;  Overall, we are very impressed with ODMS.andP;  It tiestogether several types of computers in a simple but clever and powerful way.andO;It provides workflow, tracking and reporting tools on a par with (and in manysituations better than) those provided with even the top-of-the-linesingle-vendor solutions.andP;  It is also highly customizable, to an extent manysingle-vendor approaches can't match.andP;  (We'd like to see some of thesevendors incorporate ODMS-or something very like it-into their productofferings.)andM;But ODMS has its limitations as well.andP;  Many of them are temporary, but it isnot clear how long it will be until they are removed.andP;  Here are the ones weconsider significant.andM;For the moment, ODMS is best thought of as a program that uses onlyMacintoshes as workstations.andP;  If die installation is based on a Vax server(as most are), then VT-100 terminals can be used.andP;  But many ODMS features arespecific to the Mac interface, so the VT-100s end up being second-classworkstations.andP;  PCs will eventually be supported, and so will Unixworkstations such as those from Digital and Sun.andP;  But no timetable for thissupport has been announced.andM;Existing networks and servers may not be supported.andP;  Indeed, unless you havean Ethernet or Appletalk network with a Vax  running VMS) or a Mac as aserver, you cannot run ODMS.andP;  File-servers running Unix will eventually besupported.andM;Some software modules have not yet been incorporated, such as an electronicmail interface and an interface to file-text retrieval.andM;While many Mac applications can be invoked from within ODMS, some functionsthat you might like to keep track of cannot be handled this way.andP;  imagescanning software is an example of the sort of software that must be startedfrom outside ODMS.andM;For certain applications, ODMS cannot provide the integration of processesthat a single-vendor solution can.andP;  A notable example is editing to fit: withODMS, an editor working in one application cannot know whether a piece oftext will precisely fit the space provided for it in another application.andO;But several of the single-vendor systems provide this type of functionality.andM;Some early users have experienced performance bottlenecks at the databaseserver.andP;  New software has been developed to overcome these bottlenecks, butit is not yet clear whether it will be enough to make the problem disappear.andM;ODMS can be developed and enhanced on only one workstation at a time.andP;  Thismakes it difficult for teams to develop ODMS applications.andP;  For complexapplications, serious development bottlenecks could result.andM;Finally, the flexibility of ODMS is a double-edged sword.andP;  Little is builtin, so the application becomes a reflection of the developer's vision.andP;  Ifthat vision is shrewd and accurate, an appropriate and powerful applicationcan result.andP;  But without the vision, a crude and crippled system can be builtwith equal ease.andP;  This is no fault of ODMS, of course.andP;  But compare it withsingle-vendor systems, which generally have some publishing-orientedfeatures.andP;  With such a system, there may not be as much opportunity fortailoring in the system setup, but there win also not be as much chance of abotched job.andP;  This is where Odesta's VARs, or a site's resident guru, willmake a dramatic difference in the quality of the final system.andM;Potential ODMS customers will do well to examine this list of limitationscarefully.andP;  But every product has its shortcomings.andP;  We would not want to letthese limitations obscure the strongly positive opinion we have formed ofODMS.andM;ODMS is a remarkable product and the first of its type.andP;  What surprises usmost is not the things that are missing, but rather how many things Odestahas done right on the first attempt.andP;  Odesta took on a very ambitious projectwhen it embarked on ODMS-indeed, we can't imagine that the company recognizedall the implications of what it was doing when it set off down this path.andO;But it has done well.andP;  ODMS sets a new standard for how publishing activitiescan be tied together, and it will be a tough standard for others to measureup to.andM;George AlexanderandM;Odesta's Other ProductsandM;In addition to the Helix family of products, Odesta has three other softwarelines.andP;  All are intended for users who need to extract information out oflarge amounts of data.andM;DataDesk.andP;  DataDesk is an engaging package for exploring statistical data onthe Macintosh.andP;  The traditional way of dealing with statisticalquestions-proposing a hypothesis and then testing it statistically-does notwork well when you have a mass of statistics that you don't know much about.andO;DataDesk takes a different tack.andP;  It lets you plot and chart and combine andexamine data in a variety of ways until you have uncovered the relationshipsthat lie within it.andP;  We tried out the program on some census data about agroup of neighboring communities and found it enjoyable.andP;  The graph or chartproduced in response to each question brought up new questions that begged tobe asked.andM;The program is particularly good at providing ways of getting at the dataunderlying its displays.andP;  in a graph showing the relationship between twovariables, if you see a point that seems way out of line, you can click onthe point and get information about it.andP;  Usually, there is an interestingreason for the exception (though it may also be that data was mistyped whenit was input).andM;DataDesk can import data from and export data to a variety of database andspreadsheet formats.andP;  GeoQuery.andP;  Just as DataDesk is about numericalrelationships, GeoQuery is about distances.andP;  GeoQuery is a program thatallows you to deal with locations and their characteristics.andP;  If you havedata about the location of people with sewing machines, GeoQuery can targetlikely sites for a fabric store.andP;  If you have data about north-facing slopes,snowfall amounts, and transportation routes, GeoQuery can help you locateyour new ski resort.andP;  it will also help plan efficient routes for salespeople and delivery vehicles.andM;The data you put into GeoQuery is displayed on a map.andP;  Some maps are providedwith the package, and you may modify them or create your own.andP;  Though itseems more specialized (and therefore of more limited application) thanDataDesk, there are nevertheless lots of uses for GeoQuery.andP;  Anyone who workswith maps full of push-pins will find that GeoQuery makes life a lot easier.andO;And it is likely that anyone with data that is tied to specific geographiclocations will put this product to good use.andP;  Adaptive Pattern Recognition.andO;Last summer Odesta DEC announced a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; for productsinvolving a set of Odesta-developed techniques called &quot;adaptive patternrecognition.&quot; The Odesta technology is a method of searching for patterns inlarge databases.andP;  Potential applications include targeted marketing, riskassessment, and machine diagnostics.andM;The first implementation of the technology is a program, as yet unnamed, thatwill sift through large collections of data about people's demographics andbuying habits.andP;  It can answer questions about how people's consumer choicesare related to their other characteristics.andP;  For example, the program wasgiven a sample database and was asked to find the consumer behavior that wasthe best indicator of high income level.andP;  The unexpected answer: ownership ofa 35mm camera.andP;  The program, which is currently installed at test sites, runson DEC workstations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
