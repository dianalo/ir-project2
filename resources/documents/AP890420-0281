In a case that started with a $250,000 loan, the courtunanimously denied a hearing on an appeal by ComputerLand and itsfounder, William Millard, from a lower-court ruling upholding thestock award.   During the lawsuit, Millard was driven from control of theOakland-based company.   Herbert Hafif, lawyer for the investor group, called Micro-Vest,estimated the worth of ComputerLand at $500 million. He saidMicro-Vest would own 28.5 percent of Computerland, including anadditional 8.5 percent under terms of an earlier settlement.   The $250,000 loan was made to Millard more than 12 years ago, inthe early stages of his venture. It gave the lender the right toexchange the note for 20 percent of the stock in Millard'sbusiness. Micro-Vest later bought the note and sued Millard afterhe refused to transfer the stock in 1981.   An Alameda County Superior Court jury awarded Micro-Vest 20percent of ComputerLand and $141 million in damages. The damageswere dropped in December 1985 in a partial settlement that includedadditional stock as well as Millard's resignation from thecompany's board.   Computerland now operates under new management.   In appealing the jury verdict, Millard argued that thestock-conversion feature of the original $250,000 loan applied onlyto his original computer company, called IMS. He said the companywent out of existence after a merger.   He also said he had agreed orally with one of the originallenders that the note and stock option would not be transferredwithout Millard's consent.   The 1st District Court of Appeal rejected those arguments in aruling Dec. 29.</TEXT></DOC>
