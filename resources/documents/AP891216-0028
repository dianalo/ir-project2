(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA hopes the pre-Christmas launchof space shuttle Columbia on a satellite rescue mission will takeplace Thursday.   ``There's still a lot of work to do between now and then, but weare reasonably confident of launch on the 21st,'' Robert L.Crippen, director of the space shuttle program, said Friday inannouncing the change.   The one-day postponement followed an announcement on Wednesdayof a two-day postponement. If the shuttle is not launched by Dec.23, liftoff would be delayed until at least Dec. 27 to free workersfor the Christmas holiday.   The delays have been prompted mainly by unfinished work onlaunch pad 39A, which hasn't been used for a shuttle launch innearly four years. The complex recently completed a two-year, $50million refurbishment, and it has taken technicians longer thanexpected to validate fuel lines and other systems.   Some tiny fuel leaks and other minor problems have turned up,slowing work.   During 10 days in space, Columbia's five astronauts are torelease a communications satellite for the Navy and then track downand retrieve a large science payload before it falls to Earth. Thepayload has been orbiting for six years and is scheduled to reenterthe atmosphere in March.   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein is the crew commander. The others arepilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, MarshaIvins and David Low.</TEXT></DOC>
