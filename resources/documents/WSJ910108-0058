It depends on which part of the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration you ask.</LP><TEXT>   NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in chilly NewYork plans to announce this week that 1990 was the hottestyear ever recorded. No way, replies NASA's Marshall SpaceFlight Center in steamy Huntsville, Ala. By Marshall'smeasurements, 1990 was only the fourth-hottest year since1979.   Who's right? Who knows. It depends on whether you believesatellites, which broadly measure atmospheric temperatureworld-wide, or ground-based thermometers, which giveaccurate, but isolated, readings of surface heat.   The space-agency spat, apart from making NASA lookdisorganized once again, can have political consequences. Thehotter it is outside, the more political heat the Bushadministration feels to actually do something about climatechange, instead of just study it. White House officialslatched on to the Marshall research last year to give a coldshoulder to proposals to combat global warming.   To understand the scientific part of this dispute, let'sstart with the ground. Andrew Lacis, a climate modeler atGoddard, says his institute has analyzed temperatures fromabout 1,000 ground stations spread over the globe andcompared it with past data. The conclusion: 1990 was thehottest year ever, continuing a disturbing trend towardglobal warming.   James Hansen, Goddard's director, has predicted that the1990s would show ever hotter temperatures, bearing out hismuch-publicized warnings that the man-made production ofso-called greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphereis leading to an ecological disaster.   But John Christy, a research scientist at the Universityof Alabama at Huntsville who has an office at Marshall andcollaborates with NASA scientists there, says the Goddardestimates just show the problems of ground-basedmeasurements. He and Roy Spencer, a Marshall scientist, havedeveloped a way to use satellite data to measure temperatureworld-wide. The Goddard data, on the other hand, don'tinclude any temperatures taken over the oceans, which coverstwo-thirds of the globe.   According to satellite data of the past 12 years, Mr.Christy says, there is no definite warming trend. The warmestyears were 1987, followed by 1988, 1983, and then 1990.   Mr. Lacis, the ground-thermometer man, counters thatsatellite scientists can goof by measuring too broad a swatchof the atmosphere, including cool higher altitudes. But headds: &quot;All of us must get together and work this out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
