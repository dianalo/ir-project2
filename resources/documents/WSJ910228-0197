The company, previously known as Activision, had a loss of$13.3 million, or $3.13 a share in the first nine months of1990, because of a legal judgment for patent infringement andwaning demand for some of its videogames. BHK TechnologiesCorp., Mediagenic's largest shareholder, said in January thatit would try to secure additional financing, including a $2.5million line of credit, provided management changes weremade. Although BHK is still negotiating the credit line withthe company's senior lender, Mediagenic decided it &quot;wouldn'tbe in the best interest&quot; of shareholders to further delay themanagement changes.</LP><TEXT>   Robert Kotick, a principal of BHK, was named chairman andchief executive officer, succeeding Bruce L.
