We will look atSoutheast Asia, too, {but} India is our top priority.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   When the government of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Raolast year announced its new industrial policy providing for51% foreign equity holding and promising speedy decisions oninvestment applications, GE &quot;brought forward projects in thepipeline and was encouraged to look at new projects,&quot; saysStephen J. Brandon, head of GE in India.   One project that has materialized sooner than planned as aresult of the reforms is a joint venture with $46 million ofequity divided equally between GE and Godrej andamp; BoyceManufacturing Co., India's leading manufacturer ofrefrigerators, office furniture and other products. Theventure will incorporate and expand Godrej's existingrefrigerator business and add a new factory at Malanpur, 155miles south of New Delhi, to produce washing machines,refrigerators and compressors.   The government's recent sales of shares in public-sectorconcerns has sparked GE's interest in the possibility ofbuying equity in such companies, with some of which it haslicensing or other ties. &quot;We are examining how we mightparticipate in this process,&quot; Mr. Brandon says.   Though he declines to name any enterprise as a potentialcandidate, GE has a licensing relationship for gas turbineswith Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., a manufacturer ofelectricity-generating equipment. In India's recent sale ofpublic-sector shares to mutual funds, Bharat did well, withthe entire 20% of paid-up capital on offer being taken up.The company reported net income of about $46 million for theyear ended March 31, 1990, the latest figure available. (Thecompany doesn't indicate sales totals.)   GE's first Indian venture dates from 1930, whenInternational General Electric, or IGE, was set up in Bombayinitially as a distributor for GE products. This was followedin 1962 with Elpro International Ltd., set up in Pune,southeast of Bombay, to make components for medical X-ray andpower-distribution equipment.   In 1989, GE took advantage of the easing of U.S. controlson exports of defense equipment to India to win orders forengines for a prototype light-combat aircraft being developedby state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., as well as gasturbines for the Indian Navy's frigate-manufacturing program.Some technology transfer was involved in both arrangements.   GE got Indian government clearance in February 1991 fortwo ventures aimed at expanding its manufacturing base. Thefirst is a plastics venture with the public-sector IndianPetrochemicals Corp., or IPCL, a leader in petrochemicals. Inthe recent sale of public-sector equity, mutual funds bought20% of the equity of IPCL, which in fiscal 1990 reported netincome of about $31.5 million on sales of $390 million. Knownas GE Plastics India Ltd., the joint venture shares $14million equity equally between the two partners, and willprovide engineering plastics.   The second is a joint venture, Wipro-GE Medical Systems,at Bangalore, which will begin making medical diagnosticequipment this year. The venture has initial equity of $4million shared equally between GE and Wipro Ltd., abroad-spectrum company with sales in fiscal 1990 of $70million.   Another joint venture is scheduled to be announced duringthe visit next week of S. Inaba, president of Fanuc Ltd. ofJapan. Geared to making industrial control equipment, theventure involves Fanuc, a manufacturer of machine tools, IGEand Voltas Ltd., which produces a wide range of engineeringequipment. The total equity in this is $1.55 million, with50% from Fanuc, 15% from IGE and 35% from Voltas.   &quot;Relative to the potential, this is seed investment,&quot; saysMr. Fresco, referring to the current range of investments.   Although exports are a high priority, GE has declined tomake export commitments because, Mr. Fresco says, &quot;we firstneed to achieve quality.&quot; But each GE project is geared toexporting. The Godrej venture, for example, will &quot;developexports through the GE global distribution network,&quot; whichincludes Southeast Asia, he says.   With a recent Indian government announcement that theprivate sector can move into production of defense equipment,GE says it is interested in licensing or equity relationshipsin this field. At the moment, GE is talking to state-ownedenterprises about technology transfer for the manufacture oftank turret drives for locally made Arjun and Vijayantatanks, tank gunnery simulators, and radar products forHindustan Aeronautics's lightcombat aircraft and anadvance-light-helicopter project.</TEXT></DOC>
