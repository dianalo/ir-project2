The project wascompleted in March, 1985. The analysis showed that the wood-burning furnaceis adequate to supply all the heat required in the heated area of about15m x 30m x 5.5 high, except on exremely cold days. In an average year,the savings in electricity should be approximately $2,700, based on 3.886cents/kWh. The main disadvantage of a wood-burning furnace is its labourintensive operation. This project has demonstrated that wood-burningfurnaces are viable, especially in rural areas where, a plentiful supplyof wood is available at little or no cost, manpower is available, atno cost, to operate and maintain the furnace and that the building isat a remote location where the cost of electricity or oil is high.</TEXT></DOC>
