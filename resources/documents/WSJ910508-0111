With the two countries moving toward resuming fulldiplomatic relations, perhaps by this weekend, officials andtechnical experts have held a series of meetings about apossible sale of a Soviet electric-power generating reactor.The Israelis say they might use the reactor for electricityand water desalination.</LP><TEXT>   The potential deal comes just as the U.S. is trying topersuade Israel and its Arab allies to set the groundwork fora &quot;nuclear weapons free zone&quot; in the Middle East. TheAmerican idea is to permit the spread of nuclear technologyonly to nations that allow full inspection of all theirnuclear facilities.   One U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidthat unless the Soviets get Israel to agree to open all ofits secret nuclear facilities to international inspectors,the U.S. would oppose such a sale.   Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the SovietUnion must insist on international inspection for any nuclearreactor it sells, but it isn't obliged to require that suchsafeguards apply to other facilities. Nuclear power reactorscreate tons of plutonium, some of which could be divertedinto nuclear weapons programs unless it is fully accountedfor.   There appears to be considerable interest among Israelisin a possible sale. &quot;We have to study the Sovietpossibilities,&quot; explained Ilya Zemtsov, political adviser toIsrael's minister of science and energy, Yuval Neeman. Mr.Zemtsov said Mr. Neeman, a physicist, plans to visit theSoviet Union later this month for further talks. &quot;We want tostudy the reactor the Soviets operate in Finland,&quot; he said.   The prospects for a reactor sale initially were stimulatedby Yaacov Nimrodi, an Israeli arms trader who funneledweapons to Iran for the Reagan administration during theIran-Contra affair.   The Israelis appear to be most interested in a type ofpower reactor known by western nuclear experts as&quot;Eastinghouse.&quot; There currently are two such reactors.Designed in the Soviet Union, they were exported to Finlandand were heavily modified to include safety and controlequipment from such western companies as Westinghouse andSiemens. The Finnish reactors, which are credited with havinga good operating record, use ordinary water as a coolant andare of a different design than the Soviet reactor involved inthe catastrophic accident at Chernobyl.   Two other Soviet reactors being studied by the Israelis,according to experts familiar with the talks, are a breederreactor used by the Soviets to desalinate seawater on theCaspian Sea and a smaller reactor used to power Russianicebreakers in the Arctic.   Gary Milhollin, head of the Washington-based WisconsinProject, which monitors nuclear trade, says a Soviet sale toIsrael would make it politically much tougher for the U.S. toprevent the Chinese from selling a nuclear research reactorto Algeria. &quot;It might also stimulate the Germans to completethe sale of two power reactors to Iran,&quot; he said, referringto a deal that Germany terminated after partial constructionin 1979.   Paul Leventhal, who heads the Nuclear Control Institute,another private Washington research organization, says hesuspects that the sudden Israeli interest in acquiring newreactors stems, at least in part, from the fact that Israel'ssecret reactor at Dimona in the Negev Desert is sufferingfrom increasing safety and environmental problems.   The French-built Dimona reactor, which the U.S. CentralIntelligence Agency has identified as being used to supplyplutonium for Israel's nuclear weapons program, was startedin 1957. Plutonium-producing reactors of a similar age at theU.S. Savannah River complex and at Kyshtym in the SovietUnion have had serious safety problems. Mr. Leventhal says hehopes the U.S. and the Soviets can persuade Israel to shutDimona down and open it for inspections.   A key Russian participant in the Soviet-Israeli talks isYevgeny P. Velikhov, director of the Kurchatov Institute ofAtomic Energy and vice-president of the Soviet Academy ofSciences. He spent this week talking with a number of Israeliofficials, including electric company executives. A spokesmanfor the Israeli Energy Ministry said Mr. Velikhov held&quot;general talks in the area of nuclear energy.&quot;   Mr. Velikhov's host, Mr. Neeman, is leader of Israel'sultra-hawkish Tahiya Party, as well as head of the Israeligovernment's science and energy ministries. His party hasthreatened to leave the ruling coalition if the governmentaccedes to U.S. demands concerning Israeli-Arab peace. SomeIsraeli observers think conservatives here see strengtheningties with Moscow as a way to shield the Jewish state againstpressures from the U.S.   &quot;Anybody who would be interested in Soviet nucleartechnology simply has to be delirious,&quot; says Mikhail Agursky,a Hebrew University Sovietologist. &quot;But I'm not surprised byanything connected to Minister Neeman.&quot;   Mr. Zemtsov responds that not everyone dismissed Sovietnuclear technology after Chernobyl. &quot;Look at Finland, forexample.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
