His company, Manville Corp., has been transformed by six years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy into something unique. Assuming that it clears one last legal hurdle, as it probably will in the next few days, Manville will emerge from bankruptcy under a reorganization plan that awards an initial 50% of its common stock to the &quot;Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.&quot; The MPIST is up and running in Washington, with its own board of trustees, to settle claims brought by anyone who suffered physical injury from a product Manville once produced, asbestos. The reorganization plan dilutes the holdings of former common shareholders to 6.4% and Manville could end up turning $2.5 billion of its capital and earnings over to the MPIST over the next 20 to 25 years.    &quot;The trust already has settled 5,000 claims,&quot; says Mr. Stephens. &quot;It's our job to go out and earn the money. When Manville earns a dollar, the trust earns 20 cents. They could eventually own up to 80% of our stock.&quot;    He believes there is a story that should be mandatory reading for all business managers in the mistakes Manville made by not paying sufficient attention years ago to the health risks associated with asbestos. &quot;As I look back,&quot; says Mr. Stephens, &quot;we're talking about a problem that started back in the 1930s and I have to ask myself, 'Was this unique? Was Manville an evil company that was out of synch with the rest of society?' The conclusion I come to is that Manville was probably no different from the rest of industry.    &quot;But that's not an excuse. The actions in the '30s and '40s certainly don't stand the scrutiny we would put them to today. Society has made some decisions. The lesson is you'd better listen to society very carefully and don't sit back and hide behind today's law. A businessman has to worry about tomorrow's law. In this case, society says we don't want to be exposed to a product and not be informed as to the risk of that product, and that's pretty fundamental.&quot;    No doubt that is all true but it is by no means clear that the Manville experience offers the last word on how the American legal system itself should deal with the &quot;liability crisis.&quot; English common law holds that anyone is entitled to sue for damages when he has been injured by someone else's negligence. But that perfectly reasonable and fair principle has been distorted by what has come to be called the &quot;piranha syndrome,&quot; in which plaintiff lawyers scout for products that have been found harmful by courts and juries and then organize other claimants to bring suits against the maker of that product.    These suits are what someone has described as a &quot;crapshoot,&quot; with outcomes varying widely by state, by the particular outlook of judges and juries, the skill of lawyers and, to some degree, the merits of the claim. In one court a claimant might hit the jackpot; in another he might get nothing. But one thing is fairly constant, judging from a 1982 Rand Corp. study: On average, the claimants themselves get only about half of the damages awarded, with the rest going for lawyers' fees and costs.    In economic terms, this means that the &quot;transaction&quot; costs for settling damage claims are very high. Manville, for example, has spent over $100 million on legal and professional fees during its six years of bankruptcy. Mr. Stephens, who became Manville's president and CEO midway in the bankruptcy proceedings, believes there surely must be some fairer way, from the point of view of both companies and claimants, for dealing with mass injury cases.    &quot;I get a little hot under the collar when people say that Manville entered bankruptcy to evade its legal responsibilities,&quot; he says. &quot;Giving up $2.5 billion, 20% of your profits and 80% of your stock is not exactly walking away from the right solution.&quot;    Of course, Manville directors didn't know the eventual outcome when they entered Chapter 11. All they knew was that a 1974 Texas court case had started a wave of asbestos suits and they were piling up against Manville, the nation's largest asbestos producer. Its insurers stopped paying claims and were sued by Manville in what itself became a huge legal proceeding in San Francisco. By 1981, juries had begun to make punitive-damage awards, sharply raising the cost of claims. By 1982, a special committee of the Manville board concluded that the company was facing 50,000 claims at an average cost of $40,000, for a total of $2 billion. That was more than the company's net worth. So the company entered voluntary bankruptcy.    Mr. Stephens doesn't think there was any real choice. The company could have liquidated itself, putting the proceeds in escrow to settle claims, but he believes that would merely have created a large honey pot for lawyers to fight over. That could drag on for many years, with claimants ending up with nothing. Moreover, 19,000 Manville employees would have been out of a job.    Manville no longer debates its own culpability, although there were some mitigating circumstances. It was known early in this century that breathing asbestos dust could cause a lung disease called asbestosis and some precautions were taken in asbestos factories. But other diseases, such as lung cancer, were possible as well after a long latency period, perhaps as much as 40 years.    It was during World War II, when millions of workers were urgently building Navy ships, that precautions lapsed. Workers cutting and fitting asbestos to protect ships from fire were heavily exposed. When claims started coming in, both the asbestos manufacturers and the Navy were accused of not warning workers of the hazards. But suing companies is easier than suing Uncle Sam, so it was the companies that faced the lawsuits.    Obviously, the courts have only provided a very messy and uncertain way for workers who were injured to obtain recompense. There also is another question worthy of serious public debate, the effects on innovation.    Manville of course no longer makes asbestos products but it is a profitable company specializing heavily in forest products and glass fiber. Recently its laboratories came up with something that Mr. Stephens calls &quot;the most promising business opportunity I've come across in my career.&quot; It is a biological product for use in detoxifying ground water, something that could be quite helpful in cleaning up seepage from garbage landfills.    &quot;It is phenomenal what you can do,&quot; he says. &quot;But my biggest decision is whether to kill it, because we can't buy insurance. Should we go naked, go out there and try to clean up these contaminated areas around the country without insurance? I find that very frustrating. Society needs it. My shareholders need the future earnings. I need to create jobs in this country. But we run into a blank wall. We're working on it. We're not going to give up. But we can't really drive the project at the rate I would like to see it driven.&quot;    So now there is liability risk in doing good, as well as doing harm. Manville learned to listen to society. But maybe that works both ways and society also should listen to the Manvilles of the world. </TEXT></DOC>
