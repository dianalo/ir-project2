(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's lush and lovely, and delightfulto behold, but the enchantment of purple loosestrife is fast growingold.   The bushy garden flower is invading delicate wetlands from coastto coast, choking out native plants and driving away the birds andanimals that lived among them.   Although loosestrife has been on the loose since the 1800s,biologists haven't recognized the damage until the past five years.   ``It's a very pretty plant, until you realize what it's done,''said Howard Wandell with Michigan's Department of Natural Resourcesin Lansing. ``In some of our game areas, it is creating habitatproblems.''   At this time of year, the hardy European marsh plant is in peakpurple bloom across the northern United States.   ``It's so beautiful, it's hard to be angry with it,'' saidStephen Hight, a U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher inBeltsville, Va. ``In New York, you just see fields of purple haze.It's just gorgeous.''   Although product researchers at Dow Chemical Co. areexperimenting with a selective herbicide called Garlon that couldkill loosestrife, Hight and other USDA researchers hope to importpredators for the imported pest.   The study centers on three European beetles that eat nothing butloosestrife.   Hight said the USDA will be ready within two years to release theinsects in test fields in seven states: New York, Iowa, Nebraska,Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois.   It would take five to 10 years for the bugs to breed in enoughnumbers to take on the whole continent. If they thrive and eatright, the beetles could cut the purple fields of loosestrife to afourth of their current density and hold it there, Hight saidWednesday.   ``We find that in invaded areas, the native plants, some of themendangered species, are just barely hanging on. This could allowsome of these native plants to come back in,'' he said.   Until then, fighting loosestrife is a state-by-state battle.   Minnesota and Washington have outlawed the plant, banning it evenin home gardens. Still, it has claimed more than 1 percent ofMinnesota's 2.5 million acres of wetland, said Jay Rendall of theMinnesota Department of Natural Resources.   ``I personally have witnessed how fast it spreads,'' Rendallsaid. ``I watched one 50-by-100-foot patch spread to cover a 20-acremarch in about three years.''   Loosestrife replaces cattails and rushes in which waterfowl nest.When the plant moves in, ducks move out, followed by muskrats andother animals, Rendall said.   Wisconsin prohibits the sale of all species of loosestrife, andIndiana, Ohio and Illinois place restrictions on the plant's sale.   Some states, including New York and Michigan, have enacted noanti-loosestrife laws, Rendall said. In both states, the infestationis so severe it would cost too much to even begin battling the weed,he said.   Yet loosestrife holds a peculiar attraction in Michigan, whereRendall estimates it has taken over more than 30,000 acres of marshand swamp, about the same as in Minnesota.   ``It is a very pretty plant so a lot of people here werepromoting its growth,'' Wandell said. ``Garden clubs even had somecities name their city flower the purple loosestrife.'' </TEXT></DOC>
