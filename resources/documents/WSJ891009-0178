Smith Expects@  Third-Quarter Loss@  Of Up to $10 Million </HL><DD> 10/09/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> SMCA </CO><DATELINE> MILWAUKEE  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A.O. Smith Corp., citing the effects of a lengthy strike and an unfavorable judgment in a court case in addition to softening markets, said it expects to report a third-quarter loss between $9 million and $10 million.    In the year-ago period, the company had net income of $997,000, or one cent a primary share after payment of preferred dividends, on sales of $236.6 million.    The maker of automotive equipment and other systems said a recently settled 53-day strike at a major plant in Kentucky hurt earnings, as did a $5.8 million judgment against a former subsidiary. Smith had appealed unfavorable rulings on the litigation, which dates back to 1983, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but its petition for a High Court review was recently rejected. An official said the company hadn't taken any reserve to cover the litigation.    In addition to those &quot;one-time events,&quot; Smith said, earnings were pressured by &quot;sharply lower orders for automotive, light truck and heavy truck structural products&quot; in the third quarter; the company said that with inventories of passenger cars and light trucks remaining at high levels, it anticipates lower volumes to continue into the fourth period. &quot;It's difficult at this point to be optimistic about the balance of 1989,&quot; said Robert J. O'Toole, president and chief executive officer.    For the six months, ended June 30,Smith had net income of $13.2 million, or $1.42 a share, on sales of $542.6. million. </TEXT></DOC>
