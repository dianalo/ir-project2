It is observed that Zr is a very effective strengthener,more so below Tp than above it, while a combination of Cr and Zr is capableof shifting Tp to a higher temperature. The combination results in aneffective improvement of the rupture strength of Ni{sub 3}Al. The strengtheningmechanisms of each element are discussed in this paper. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
