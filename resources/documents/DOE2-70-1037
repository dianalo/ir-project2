In order to identify the harmfulsubstances to which laborers are exposed and to take the measures forremoving them, it is necessary to investigate in detail into many factorsrelated to the effect of aerosol on human bodies, such as the compositionof elements, chemical condition, concentration, the particle size ofdust and temporal and spatial distributions. For the purpose, samplingand analysis must be carried out so that information can be extractedas much as possible from a minute amount of sample. The particle inducedx-ray emission (PIXE) analysis is very effective for this application.In this paper, the development of a PIXE analysis system and the knowledgeobtained by the sampling and measurement of aerosol in indoor labor environmentare reported. The labor environment selected is that of the workshopof Department of Liberal Arts, University of Tokyo. Sampling, the experimentalapparatus, the method of data analysis and the results of analysis aredescribed. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
