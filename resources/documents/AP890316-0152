While Bostonians were preparing green beer and green bagels, theU.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service raided four businessessuspected of employing illegal aliens. Ten Irish natives werearrested on charges of being illegal immigrants.   INS officials said Tuesday's arrests of four men at aconstruction site in Hanover, N.H., and six women in a raid on asuburban Quincy restaurant were purely coincidental and not part ofa coordinated sweep.   ``We don't enforce the law by holiday or nationality,'' said INSDistrict Director Charles T. Cobb. ``It just happened.''   But several Irish immigrants and Irish-Americans said the INS'timing showed bad taste.   ``It doesn't show a whole lot of sensitivity,'' said DorisCadigan, who emigrated from County Cork to Natick in 1971. ``Nobodywants to be illegal... It brings out an attitude that these peoplehave done something wrong.''   ``It could be interpreted as a calculated insult to the Irishcommunity, but I'm sure it wasn't intended that way,'' PatrickHurley, a founder of the IIRM, said in a telephone interview fromthe group's New York office, one of 16 pushing for relaxingimmigration restrictions concerning the Irish.   Cobb said that about 50 to 60 Irish natives were charged withimmigration law violations last year. Estimates, from the INS andother sources, put the population of illegal immigrants in Boston atbetween 15,000 and 25,000 people. U.S. Reps. Brian Donnelly,D-Mass., and Howard Berman, D-Calif., have sponsored visa programsthat will permit 60,000 new immigrants by 1991 from 37 countries,including Ireland, that have been under-represented in the past,Cobb said.   Of the 10,000 visas issued since 1986 under Donnelly's bill,about 4,700 went to people from Ireland, he said.   But the lawyer representing the women arrested at the Quincyrestaurant said U.S. immigration policy still favors Asians andCentral and South Americans who can claim political persecution,while penalizing the Irish and other Europeans.   ``The immigration laws in this country are such that the Irishimmigrants do not have an equal chance of achieving legal status,''said George McMahon, who said his clients would aggressively fightdeportation. ``It's out-and-out discrimination.''   Hurley called it ``hypocritical for America to be celebrating theIrish contribution while excluding people who are continuing thatvery same tradition.''   Still, Doris Cadigan notes, that tradition and the hoopla itinspires can be a bit bewildering to Irish natives.   In Ireland, celebrations are quieter and less commercial, withpeople wearing fresh shamrock sprigs and attending church ratherthan parading and displaying plastic leprechauns, Cadigan said.   ``When I came over first I was a little offended by it becauseSt. Patrick is very dear to us, because he brought us the (Catholic)faith,'' Cadigan said. ``Now I have learned even to drink green beerif it is offered to me.''</TEXT></DOC>
