Under the two-year-old Immigration Reform and Control Act, the U.S. government through August sent 387 notices of &quot;intent to fine&quot; to employers accused of knowingly hiring illegal immigrants or failing to keep required paper work on new hires. In Texas, enforcement has been especially aggressive. Though the state, by a 1980 Census estimate, has 9% of the nation's illegal immigrants, 30% of the appealable notices have been filed there.    A quarter of the notices have gone to employers in California, which has about half of the illegal-immigrant population. Florida and New York also have been hit. But only two notices have been issued in Illinois, though Chicago had the nation's third-highest concentration of undocumented aliens.    Heavy enforcement areas include Los Angeles and San Diego in California and Harlingen and San Antonio in Texas.    PHONY DOCUMENTS soar in price in the wake of the immigration law.    Four people are accused in Houston of selling forged birth certificates and birth registration cards for as much as $2,000 each. Before the act, recalls Dennis Smith of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, &quot;we would arrest people with documents costing $300 to $500.&quot; To him, &quot;there is no doubt&quot; the immigration act has bloated the demand and price.    In California, INS officials recently smashed a ring that charged $35 to $60 for packages of fraudulent alien registration receipts and Social Security cards. That's also up from what had been the going street price. &quot;It's whatever the market will bear,&quot; declares John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations in Los Angeles.    AMNESTY FOR FARMHANDS exceeds expectations. And it may yet grow.    Some 850,000 illegal immigrants have applied to remain in the U.S. under a special amnesty provision covering field workers in perishable commodities. That's twice as many as the INS had anticipated, and the program remains open through Nov. 30. The general amnesty program, which was open to illegals who could prove they were here since Jan. 1, 1982, ran out on May 4, with 1.8 million applicants, mostly from Mexico.    Now a federal judge in Rockford, Ill., has ordered that the farm amnesty be extended to sod-grass workers, over the objections of the Agriculture Department. About 10,000 workers would be affected, a growers' attorney says. Similar suits forced the INS to accept applications from cotton and sugar-cane workers. But federal officials worry the program could be rife with fraud.    &quot;Some of these people have never even seen a farm,&quot; contends Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the INS.    WHAT SHORTAGE? Last year's cries that the immigration act would brake the flow of farm laborers has yielded this year to reports of an oversupply. Western growers say they had more than enough hands during the peak spring and summer months.    JUSTICE DEPARTMENT attorneys, invoking the immigration act, have filed civil complaints accusing more than 20 companies of discriminating against workers because of their national origin or citizenship. In all, the agency has heard some 250 protests from workers; 29 have been settled with back pay and offers of reinstatement.    LEGAL STRATEGY: The Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Services in San Francisco puts together a pamphlet suggesting alternative employment strategies for illegal immigrants in a tightening job market. The alternatives don't require proof of legal residence, the group says.    INS COMMISSIONER Alan Nelson bristles at the prospect that Kitty Dukakis, long interested in refugee and immigration policies, could become First Lady. If Michael Dukakis wins the presidency, his wife could become the INS's &quot;de facto commissioner,&quot; Mr. Nelson tells an INS conference.    NEXT ON THE AGENDA: a push to revamp who's allowed to immigrate.    The U.S. currently admits about 600,000 immigrants a year under a system on the books since 1965 that favors applicants sponsored by relatives or American employers. Relatives now outnumber the skilled immigrants 9 to 1, but a Senate-passed bill would expand the preference for candidates with education and talents considered in short supply. The measure, though, eventually would impose a ceiling of 590,000 on the total admitted each year.    A proposal in the House also would favor immigrants with needed skills. But that version wouldn't put any numerical cap on the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, among other more-generous provisions. This is designed to answer complaints that restrictions on family-reunification could damage the family structure of immigrants here.    The House isn't likely to act this session. Still, changes in admission procedures are expected eventually.    THE CHECKOFF: Los Tigres Del Norte, a California band that chronicles immigrant woes, sings of &quot;Tres Veces Mojado,&quot; or &quot;Three Times Wet,&quot; the travails of a Salvadoran crossing three borders to the U.S. . . . In Laredo, Texas, the U.S. Border Patrol introduces 200 teen-age Explorer Scouts to such outdoor skills as how to track illegal immigrants with camera surveillance. </TEXT></DOC>
