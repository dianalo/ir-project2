 Clarity is a program which bucks the trendtowards WYSIWYG packages while at the same time offering strong hooks intoone of the most popular visual environments used professionally today --Ventura Publisher.andP;  ThoughtSupportSystems (TSS), the company that wrote thesystem, argues that software has become too complex and sophisticated foraverage users and that you can genuinely increase productivity by'protecting' people from these baffling features.andM;In support of this, the company has produced Clarity, a text-based wordprocessing program that allows you to produce fully tagged files which canthen be dumped into Ventura Publisher.andP;  The relevant styles are initiallycreated by a DTP professional and then attached to Clarity documents.andP;  Inthis way, argues TSS, non-DTP types can hammer out docuemtns on modestlyequipped PCs and then send them to the main DTP machine for final editing andoutputting.andM;This, of course, is a highly attractive proposition.andP;  To run VenturaPublisher properly you need a reasonably powered 386 -- a very fast 286 willjust about do -- good VGA graphics (though a large screen is even better) anda largish hard disk.andP;  That's likely to cost above 3,500 pounds for a 'name'machine.andP;  With prices like that, PC managers are inclined to keep a watchfuleye on the number of users they encourage to get involved in DTP.andP;  Contrastthat with a small network of cheap XT-clones (average price under 1,000pounds) preparing and editing long documents with Clarity and then passingthem to a central Ventura installation for a final wash and brush up.andP;  Youcan see the attraction.andM;As far as network support goes, Clarity is actually not that sophisticated.andO;It supports IBM's NETBIOS which means it'll work with all the popular localarea networks, but TSS has eschewed further sophistication in order to offerClarity across as broad a range of products as possible.andP;  To this end, theprogram locks the files currently in use so that they can't be changedinadvertently by anyone else.andM;There's no special network version of Clarity, just as there's no specialnetwork price.andP;  The more you want, the more you pay.andP;  Big customers can arguethe toss on discounts on an individual basis.andM;Setting up goes something like this.andP;  You get a designer to create your stylesheets in Ventura and store them in the Typeset sub-directory that Venturacreates.andP;  Then, you create equivalent Clarity files (with the extension .CLF)for each style -- either from within the program or (and this is far easier)by doing a first run on Ventura and then exporting the resulting ASCII text,including the Ventura tags, to Clarity.andP;  Once this is done, you ned only makesure the Ventura .STY files and the Clarity .CLF files have the same name,and you can switch the tagged text between the two different programs.andM;What's important is that as you update the tags, you make sure their namesare carried through to the Clarity style file or the Ventura style filedepending on which program you're working with.andP;  Also, it's important tounderstand that if you create a new tag name in Clarity, you still need toset the font and format attributes in Ventura.andP;  Future releases will enableyou to take the same Clarity documents and use them with other DTP packageslike Interleaf and PageMaker.andM;For publications of a just few pages, there's probably little advantage tousing Clarity over an ordinary word processing program, where a professionalcould set up macros to insert the relevant Ventura style tags.andO;Alternatively, and for short flyers, it's easy enough to tart up plain textonce it's in Ventura.andP;  For medium to large documents, though, Clarity couldbe invaluable, because once a style has been set, users don't need to knowabout all the clever stuff Clarity does in the background--you simply whackin the text.andM;In use, Clarity is something of an oddity -- it's a kind of cross between anoutliner and a database, with the emphasis on the former.andP;  That said, it doeshave a number of relatively advanced word processing features includingautomatic save, macros, search and replace, thesaurus and spelling checker.andO;But at heart, it's still an outliner, which means that you'll find it unusualat first because of the way it uses headings and sub-headings to organizetext.andM;Otuliners work by 'attaching' text to headings and sub-headings and by givingyou the facility for moving those headings easily around a document.andP;  As theheadings move, so does the attached text.andP;  By using special editing keys youcan promote sub-headings to main headings and vice versa, promote and demotewhole sections of headings (and their text) and move headings around theplace.andP;  It's also possible to collapse text up into its heading so you canhave an entire report summarized on half a dozen lines by just viewing theheadings.andP;  This makes it easier to follow the thread of a complicated report.andO;When you want to see the associated text you simply move to that heading anduncollapse the text.andM;This outlining technology is central to the way Clarity attaches styles toits documents for use in Ventura Publisher.andP;  It works like this.andM;Clarity creates two kinds of files which are associated with the samedocument.andP;  The first contains text in its outline/database format.andP;  Thesecond contains all the style instructions that go to create a Clarity layoutfile -- think of it as a Ventura style file.andM;The idea is that though you'll be creating large numbers of documents, you'llprobably only have a handful of house styles that apply to them: one formanuals, another for progress reports, another for annual reports, and so on.andO;(Frankly, these file 'combinations' caused much head scratching and furrowingof brows, until, with the help of Peter Gloster from PC User Enterprises, Iwas able to fathom what Clarity was doing.andP;  As you shunt text to and fromVentura/Clarity, it takes the relevant tags along and automatically updatesthe attached Ventura/Clarity style sheets with any new tag names.andO;Difficulties are also compounded for the unwary by the complex way Venturamakes up chapter files.)andM;To simplify matters you should think of a working document or publication asbeing made up of four distinct components: a Clarity file, a Clarity stylefile, a Ventura chapter file and a Ventura style file.andP;  Some schematics inthe manual help explain what's going on.andM;The program comes equipped with a number of ready-to-run styles for thingslike books, brochures, reports and manuals, which correspond to the examplesyou get with Ventura.andP;  The quickest way to get started is to set up a blankpage and then apply a style to it.andP;  That means as you type in your text,Clarity will automatically attach the necessary tags as you move from sectionto section.andP;  Let's say it's a contents page with half a dozen main headingswith attached explanatory text under each heading.andP;  The Clarity style sheetwill attach the relevant style (say, Contents.CLF) to the main heading (forthe sake of argument let's call it 'heading') and a different one to theassociated text ('body text').andP;  If, at a later date, you insert additions inthe explanatory text, or move stuff around, they'll be styled in the correctway because the outline technology makes sure all the sections stay togetheras discrete units.andM;Alternatively, Clarity will also allow you to create styles 'on the fly'.andO;This is more difficult and I doubt that many Clarity users will get tooheavily involved in this kind of detail.andP;  Anyway, when it comes to typestylesand real DTP formatting, you'l have to use Ventura anyway.andM;The program has a few quirks.andP;  In the version I reviewed, the filer waspretty well useless.andP;  Clarity makes it hard to move between directoriesbecause when it lists the currently available files, it doesn't display anyof the other directories on the disk.andP;  So to switch to a different directoryyou have to come out of the filing list, backspace and then manually type inthe new directory path.andP;  After some discussion with TSS, the company hasconfirmed that the released version will incorporate more extensive filingfacilities, though of course I haven't seen them.andP;  Second, the programsometimes makes it difficult to back out of an operation and will continue toprompt for, say, a file name, even if you keep pressing Esc.andP;  It's alsopossible to begin loading a file in the wrong format and then get stuck in aloop from which your only escape is the big red switch.andM;The documentation also needs pepping up.andP;  There's a reasonable index andreference guide at the back, but it needs more tutorial material to explainhow the relationship between Clarity and Ventura actually works.andP;  But asthings stand, the combination of a middling manual and a grotty filer makethe program harder to understand than it need be.andP;  Neither can Clarity offerthe fine tuning you'd expect from a proper DTP system -- all it will give youis a rough approximation.andM;On the other hand, Clarity's help functions are generally good, andincorporate one neat feature I haven't seen outside the Macintosh which oftenuses Hypercard screens for help.andP;  It's context sensitive (most of the time)but interestingly, some screens contain flags to other relevant help screens.andO;Thus, when you're setting up a style for the first time and you pull up theauthor's notes help screen, you'll notice that two other commands, View andColours, are highlighted.andP;  That means they're 'active' and you can access anyhelp relating to them by moving the cursor over the one you're interested inand pressing Return.andM;If you produce mainly simple, short documents you're better off suing aconventional WP program and inserting the tags manually, with pre-definedmacros.andP;  However, for long mainly text-based reports or other structuredmaterial, Clarity is worth a look.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
