Resins are forced into the formations by high      pressures instantaneously applied when perforations are formed in casing      in wells or when pressures are released from tubing in wells. Perforating,      explosives or gas generators may be used in addition to the high pressures      for driving resins into formations. The resins are polymerized to form      permeable consolidated zones around wells. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a method of chemical sand control in wells      drilled through subterranean formations. More specifically, the method      comprises instantaneous application of pressure to drive a resin from a      wellbore into the formation, the pressure being greater than a selected      value, and subsequently driving the resin into the formation. Perforating      means or explosives in the wellbore may subsequently be used to assist in      driving the resin into the formation. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Hydrocarbons are often found in unconsolidated rocks. These rocks are      usually relatively young in geologic age, and are unconsolidated because      natural processes have not cemented the rock grains together by mineral      deposition. Vast amounts of oil and gas are produced from these      unconsolidated rocks, the most notable production being along the Gulf      Coast of the United States, in the Gulf of Mexico, in the North Sea and in      several other areas of the world. </PAR><PAR>  To produce oil and gas from these reservoirs, it is necessary to employ      &quot;sand control&quot; methods in the wells. There are two types of sand control      methods--mechanical and chemical. Mechanical methods employ filter-type      devices which are placed in the well opposite the unconsolidated sand and      which prevent movement of rock grains into the wellbore. Such methods are      sometimes successful, but the filter materials often plug or erode.      Chemical methods employ a liquid resin which is injected from a wellbore      into the unconsolidated rock surrounding the well. The resin is      catalytically polymerized to form a porous, permeable rock mass. With most      resins, it is necessary to inject a displacement fluid, which is a fluid      following the resin which is not miscible with the resin. The purpose of      this displacement fluid is to reduce the saturation of the resin in the      rock to a lower value, which increases permeability to flow through the      consolidated mass. The catalyst for the polymerization may be included in      the resin or it may be injected in the displacement fluid. Several types      of resins are presently used in the sand control art. These include furan,      epoxy, phenolic, phenolic-furfuryl, and phenol-formaldehyde resins. </PAR><PAR>  Chemical methods have several important advantages over mechanical methods,      but the high cost of the resins and the difficulties in obtaining      sufficiently uniform injection of chemicals have limited application to      relatively short intervals of perforations. In some unconsolidated      reservoirs where production is marginal, the high cost of chemical sand      control has prevented recovery of the oil or gas. The paper &quot;Sand Control,      Part 7, Consolidating Formation Sand by Chemical Methods Requires Precise      Application and Careful Fluid Handling,&quot; World Oil, May, 1975, pp. 47-53,      is a summary of the many factors that must be considered in chemical sand      control. </PAR><PAR>  In conventional oil field practices, soon after a well is drilled, casing      is placed in the well and cemented in place through the zone of interest.      The casing must be perforated to allow production of fluids from the well.      Sometimes perforating means, usually a perforating gun, which may be      shaped charge or bullet gun, is used inside casing with no other pipe in      the well. More often, tubing is run into the well to the desired depth,      the drilling fluid is displaced by another fluid, a packer on the tubing      is activated to seal the annulus outside the tubing and above the packer      to pressure, and a perforating gun is lowered into the well to the desired      depth to perforate the casing. The fluid in the wellbore at the depth to      be perforated when the perforating gun is fired is called the &quot;perforating      fluid&quot; or &quot;completion fluid.&quot; When the casing is perforated without tubing      in the well, the pressure in the casing is usually raised to a value      greater than fluid pressure in the formation before perforating. This is      called &quot;overbalanced perforating.&quot; Perforating fluids that do not contain      solid particles which plug perforations are normally recommended as      perforating fluids. </PAR><PAR>  When tubing is in the well, pressures in the well are often adjusted to      make pressure inside the wellbore less than the formation fluid pressure      when the well is perforated. This is called &quot;underbalanced perforating.&quot; A      &quot;through-tubing&quot; perforating gun is used. The technique is used to      minimize plugging of the perforations from solids in the wellbore fluid      and to assist in clearing perforations of debris. (See Production      Operations, Vol. 1, Chap. 7, by Allen, T. O. and Roberts, A. P., Oil and      Gas Consultants International, Inc., Tulsa, 1978.) If underbalanced      perforating is not used, special back flow and surging techniques have      often been recommended to clean the perforations of solids before      chemicals are injected for sand control. A sand control resin has not      heretofore been considered as a perforating fluid. The effect of producing      a well before sand control is practiced is often that sand will be      produced and the formation around the well can then collapse or move      toward the wellbore. This disturbance of the near wellbore region may have      long term detrimental effects resulting from increased flow of solids      toward the well. </PAR><PAR>  Prior art methods of injecting sand control chemicals into formations have      required pumping large amounts of fluids. Common practice has been to      treat a well for sand control soon after perforating, sometimes after a      short production time to help clean the perforations. Large volumes of      chemical resins are generally necessary to insure that resin enters every      perforation. If every perforation is not treated, sand particles may flow      from even a single perforation in sufficient quantity to cause the well to      cease production. Experts often suggest that resin be injected into the      formation in amounts of about 100 gallons per foot of perforations in an      effort to treat the formation. The resins cost as much as $40 to $50 per      gallon, so the cost of chemicals for the prior art sand control methods is      quite high. High costs have prevented economic production of some      unconsolidated zones. Also, it is sometimes necessary to control sand      production even before a new well can be tested. The high cost of prior      art methods of sand control, either mechanical or chemical, can discourage      testing of some zones. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,693,856 discloses use of clean fluids (those which will not      plug perforations) to replace drilling fluid in wellbores before the      casing in the well is perforated. Controlled density fluids such as gelled      oils, acid and other gelled liquids are described. The well pressure is      controlled by having fluid densities in the wellbore to produce      hydrostatic pressures greater than the pressure in the formation to be      perforated. After perforating, the clean fluids enter the formation around      the well. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,718,264 discloses a method of firing a perforating gun when      the gun is surrounded by cement in the cased wellbore. The gun is placed      opposite a zone that is to be sealed or isolated from a separate producing      interval in the well. The cement is said to be forced practically      simultaneously through the newly formed perforations and into fractures in      the formation by the force of the perforating process. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,689,008 discloses a method of forcing cement or      cementitious material through preexisting perforations by igniting a high      explosive in the wellbore above the perforations. A shaped charge directed      downward and placed above the perforations is preferred. The purpose of      the cementitious material is to permanently plug the preexisting      perforations. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,009,757 discloses a method of completing an unconsolidated      production zone by perforating into the zone with a polymeric material in      the wellbore which sets to form a porous mass in the perforations and the      wellbore. </PAR><PAR>  There is a significant need for a method of sand control which provides      perforations free of plugging material, places resin for sand control      effectively through all perforations and into the formation, and allows      the use of smaller amounts of resin and less equipment at a well to      decrease costs. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In one embodiment of this invention, resin or a resin solution for sand      consolidation is placed in a cased well before the casing is perforated. A      higher density pre-flush liquid may be placed below the resin and a lower      density displacement fluid may be placed above the resin in the wellbore.      The pressure in the wellbore fluid at the depth to be perforated is      increased to a value at least higher than the fluid pressure in the      formation before perforating, but may be increased to a value higher than      the formation fracturing pressure at the depth of the perforations. The      casing is perforated with through-tubing or tubing-conveyed perforating      means. After perforating, explosives or gas generators may be activated in      the wellbore and fluid may be injected at the surface to force additional      fluid through the perforations. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment, tubing is present in a well in which the casing has      previously been perforated, the tubing having means to contain high      pressure, resin is placed in the tubing and pressured such that when      pressure is instantaneously released from the tubing the pressure in the      wellbore is at least greater than the fluid pressure in the formation and      may be above the fracturing pressure of the formation to be treated and      pressure is released from the tubing. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic sketch of a wellbore containing unperforated      casing with resin surrounding perforating means in the wellbore, along      with surface equipment. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic sketch of a wellbore containing tubing having a      means on the lower end of the tubing for containing high pressure, along      with surface equipment. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1, a well 10 is drilled through an unconsolidated      formation 50. The wellbore contains casing 12 and tubing 14. The annulus      between the tubing 14 and casing 12 is sealed with the packer 16. A means      for perforating 21 has been placed opposite the formation 50 by use of the      wireline 23. The wireline passes over the sheave 62 to a reel mechanism 64      and is connected to control center 66, from which the perforating means 21      is activated. Pressure inside the tubing is sealed by lubricator apparatus      60. Pumps 44 and 48 are connected through valves 42 and 46, respectively,      to wellhead 40. Resin solution 30 has been pumped into the lower part of      the wellbore opposite the formation 50 which is to be consolidated.      Displacement fluid 32 has been placed in the wellbore immediately above      the resin solution 30. Displacement fluid 32 maintains its position above      the resin because of a lower density of the displacement fluid 32 than the      resin solution 30. A rathole fluid (not shown) more dense than the resin      solution may be placed in the wellbore below the depth where perforations      are to be formed. The fluids in the wellbore may be placed by pumping them      down the well before the packer is set or sealed, using surface pumps 44      and 48, connected through valves 42 and 46, or the fluids may be placed by      use of a wireline bailer or by coil tubing. The fluids other than the      resin solution 30 may be water-based or oil-based, depending on the type      of resin being injected. The density of the water-based fluids is      controlled by addition of salts, water-miscible solvents or other methods      well-known in the art. The density of oil-based fluids is controlled by      mixtures of solvents of different densities or other methods well-known in      the art. The difference in density of fluids in contact in the wellbore to      obtain stable positions of the fluids by gravity force is preferably at      least about 0.2 pounds per gallon of fluid. </PAR><PAR>  Perforating means 21 has been lowered on wireline 23 running over sheave 62      using reel mechanism 64. Perforating means 21 is placed at a depth      opposite at least a part of the formation 50. The perforating means may be      any of several types of perforating guns well-known in the art, including      shaped charge and bullet guns or high-pressure fluid streams. </PAR><PAR>  The casing is pressured by injecting a lower density fluid, preferably a      gas phase or a liquid-gas mixture (not shown), or by increasing the height      of the column of displacement fluid 32. The pressure in the tubing is      increased to a selected value such that the pressure in the resin solution      30 at the depth of the top of the perforating means is at least higher      than the fluid pressure in the formation 50. The pressure in the formation      50 is determined by pressures in nearby wells, by measurements made before      the casing 12 was placed in the well 10, or from other geologic      information available and well-known in the art. Perforating of the casing      will then be &quot;overbalanced perforating,&quot; and the resin solution will serve      as the &quot;perforating fluid,&quot; as these terms were herein defined. </PAR><PAR>  The pressure in resin solution 30 should be at least greater than the      formation pore pressure before perforating, to cause resin around the      perforating means to flow into each of the new perforation tunnels. The      use of resin solution as a perforating fluid improves the efficiency of      resin placement in each perforation. Displacement fluid 32 will serve to      reduce the saturation of resin in the formation and thereby to enhance the      permeability of the consolidated formation. Surfactants, coupling agents      and diluents in the resin solution may further enhance this retained      permeability and improve the consolidated sand strength. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the pressure in the resin 30 at the depth of the top of the      perforating means is increased to a value greater than the minimum      fracturing pressure of the formation 50. This pressure is determined by      minimum fracturing pressures in nearby wells or by other geologic      information. If no such data are available, it can be assumed that the      minimum fracturing pressure in formation 50 is 0.7 psi per foot of depth,      which is an average value for many formations. More preferably, the      pressure in the resin 30 at the depth of the top of the perforating means      is increased to a value higher than the fracturing pressure to overcome      the overburden stress in the earth, which has a value of about 1.0 psi per      foot of depth for many formations. This higher pressure can cause a more      even distribution of the resin to all perforations formed and can allow      more debris to be flushed into the fracture from the perforations after      they are formed. </PAR><PAR>  Although I have discovered that unconsolidated or loosely consolidated      sands can be treated with resin under pressures exceeding fracturing      pressures of the formation treated, the treating with resins under      fracturing conditions has not been recommended by experts in the past.      See, for example, &quot;Sand Control, Part 7--Consolidating Formation Sand by      Chemical Methods Requires Precise Application and Careful Fluid Handling,&quot;      World Oil, May, 1975, pp. 51-52. </PAR><PAR>  After the selected pressure has been reached in the resin surrounding the      perforating means, perforating means 21 is activated by the control 66.      Resin enters the formation 5 and is displaced by displacement fluid 32.      Displacement fluid 32 is lower in density than the resin 30 and may      contain a catalyst for polymerization of the resin 30. The difference in      density is preferably at least 0.2 pounds per gallon of fluid.      Displacement fluid 32 decreases the saturation of resin solution 30 in the      formation 50 such that permeability to fluid flow through the formation      after consolidation will be increased. A fluid (not shown) having a lower      density than displacement fluid 32 by at least 0.2 pounds per gallon of      fluid is used to drive the lower fluids from the wellbore and into the      formation 50. This lower density fluid may be a liquid pumped from the      surface by pump 44 or pump 48. Preferably, the lower density fluid      contains a gaseous phase. This fluid may be nitrogen, which may be used to      gasify a liquid which is pumped into the well. The compressibility of the      gaseous phase allows more continuous injection of fluid through the      perforations immediately after activation of the perforating means 21.      Injection of the lower density fluid after activation of the perforating      means 21 may continue to drive the resin solution 30 and displacement      fluid 32 into the formation 50. </PAR><PAR>  After the initial perforations in the casing are formed, additional devices      are useful for driving the resin or displacing fluid into the formation.      One such device is a perforating gun, such as may be used for forming the      initial perforations. Activation of a perforating gun to form additional      perforations in the casing in the same interval as the initial      perforations is useful to divert fluids to all perforations. Activation of      explosives such as RDX, HMX, and PIX inside the casing in proximity to the      perforations is useful to drive the fluids through all perforations.      Activation of propellants such as M-5 and HXP-100 or other modified      nitrocellulose propellants or propellants of the modified or unmodified      nitroamine class is also useful to divert the fluids to all perforations      and drive the fluids through the perforations more uniformly. These      propellants are used in commercial devices called &quot;gas generators,&quot; which      are available from Servo-Dynamics, Inc. of Santa Barbara, Calif. All such      perforating guns, explosives, propellants or gas generators can be placed      by lowering on a wire line such as the wire line 23 of FIG. 1 and      activating through a control such as 66 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  If more than one zone is to be consolidated by the method of this      invention, it is necessary to prevent flow of the resin or other fluids      into the zone previously consolidated. This is normally accomplished by      mechanical devices such as bridge plugs and retrievable packers which are      placed at appropriate depths in the well using well-known techniques.      Existing perforations may also be temporarily plugged using particulate      materials and other sealers known in industry. Any diverting method which      prevents fluid flow into perforated zones in the wellbore while the      additional zone is treated is suitable. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment of this invention, a pre-flush fluid is placed in the      casing at the depth where perforations are to be formed. The resin is then      placed in the wellbore above the pre-flush fluid. The pre-flush fluid has      higher density than the resin, preferably at least 0.2 pounds per gallon      higher. The pressure in the pre-flush liquid when the perforating means is      activated is selected to be greater than formation fluid pressure and      preferably higher than formation fracturing pressure, as described above.      Procedures as described previously for injecting the fluids are applied. </PAR><PAR>  Although the perforating means of FIG. 1 is shown attached to wireline 23,      it is possible to place the perforating means in a well attached to the      tubing. Such tubing-conveyed perforating means are well-known in industry.      The tubing can be placed in the well when sealed on the bottom and resin      and other fluids such as a displacement fluid and nitrogen can be used to      pressure the tubing. Alternatively, resin can be placed in the casing      before the tubing-conveyed perforating gun is run into the well.      Additional resin can then be placed in the tubing along with displacement      fluid and nitrogen. Various means, such as dropping of a bar down the      tubing or a pressure-activated device, are available for opening the      bottom of the tubing and firing the perforating gun. After the perforating      gun is fired, additional fluid can be injected from the surface to      displace the resin solution into the formation or to catalyze the      polymerization of the resin. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 2, illustrating yet another embodiment of this invention,      a well 10 contains casing 12 and tubing 14. Perforations 28 exist in the      casing 12 opposite the formation 50 to be consolidated. The tubing 14 in      the well has a device 80 near the lower end of the tubing to contain      pressure inside the tubing until it can be instantaneously released and      applied to the formation to be consolidated. The device 80 may be a valve      which can be opened and closed by manipulation of pressure in the annulus      above the packer 16. Such a device is sold commercially under the names      LPRN and APR valves by Halliburton Services of Duncan, OK. Alternatively,      the device 80 may be a diaphragm which is selected to burst at a      pre-selected pressure differential. As yet another alternative, the device      80 may be a diaphragm which is ruptured at the selected time by a bar 82      which is released through valve 24 in a pressure head 84. The device 80      may be placed at any location in the lower portion of the tubing, but      preferably is placed near the lower end of the tubing. </PAR><PAR>  Fluid 31 is placed in the well before the packer 16 is set or is fluid      previously produced from the formation. Packer 16 is not necessary if the      casing 12 will safely retain the pressure to be applied to the      perforations 28, but normally packer 16 is used. Pressure is increased in      the tubing by pumping in fluids. Fluid 30 may be a pre-flush fluid or may      be resin solution. Fluid 32 may be resin solution or a displacement fluid.      Fluid 34 may be displacement fluid or may be a fluid having a gaseous      phase. The order in which fluids enter the formation is pre-flush fluid,      resin solution, displacement fluid and gaseous phase, if pre-flush fluid      is utilized. A density difference of at least about 0.2 pounds per gallon      of fluid is maintained to achieve gravity stabilization of the position of      the fluids in the wellbore. The fluids are pumped into the tubing by pumps      44 or 48 through control valves 42 or 46, respectively, and wellhead 40. </PAR><PAR>  Pressure inside the tubing is preferably increased until release of the      tubing pressure will cause the pressure at the perforations 28 to be      higher than the fracturing pressure of the formation 50. Alternatively,      the pressure may be increased such that the pressure will be higher than      0.7 psi per foot of vertical depth of the top of the perforations 28. More      preferably, pressure inside the tubing is increased such that the pressure      will be higher than 1.0 psi per foot of vertical depth of the top of the      perforations 28 immediately after pressure inside the tubing is released.      The device 80 is then opened. Fluid 34 may be injected from the surface to      maintain fracturing pressures at the perforations 28 for a selected time.      Preferably, a gaseous phase is present in the tubing such that pressure is      maintained more uniformly and under fracturing conditions such that the      consolidating fluids are diverted more evenly to all perforations and      debris is swept from the perforations into the fractures created. </PAR><PAR>  Resins used in the various embodiments of this invention, including those      illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, may be selected from commercial resins      used for sand consolidation. These include furan, epoxy, phenolic,      phenolic-furfuryl and phenol-formaldehyde resins. A preferred resin is an      acid-curable furan resin. In preferred embodiments of the present      invention, resin solution 30 is comprised of one of the resins described      above with a diluent additive such as furfuryl alcohol, butyl lactate, and      esters of phthalic, oxalic, maleic and succinic acids. The resin diluent      can comprise substantially any of the known diluent compounds. Such resin      diluents can serve to induce a variety of desirable properties to the      resin solution. Lower viscosity of the resin solution, improved      dispersibility and improved sand grain coating, resulting in improved      compressive strength and higher retained permeability of the consolidated      sand are examples of improvements resulting from diluents. </PAR><PAR>  The resin solution 30 may also include a coupling agent to promote strong      resin-to-sand grain bonding. Organosilicon compounds are commonly used as      coupling agents. A preferred compound is      N-beta-(aminoethyl)-gamma-amino-propyltrimethoxy silane. </PAR><PAR>  The catalyst for polymerization of the resins may be added to the resin      solution 30 or may be included in the displacement fluid 32. The      displacement fluid may be aqueous or hydrocarbon. The preferred      displacement fluid will depend on the resin used. For example, with furan      resin, the displacement fluid is aqueous and an acid such hydrochloric      acid added to the aqueous fluid serves as the polymerization catalyst. For      epoxy resins, the displacement fluid is normally hydrocarbon and the resin      may be internally catalyzed by a catalyst in the resin solution or      externally catalyzed by a catalyst in the displacement fluid. Surfactants      added to the resin or the displacement fluid may be used. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described invention will be further described and illustrated by      the following examples, offered for the purpose of illustration and not      limitation. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A furan resin, such as the product sold by OTIS Sand Control under the      trade name &quot;HYDROFIX,&quot; is used. The resin solution has a density of 9.4      ppg (pounds per gallon) and contains surfactant, diluent and coupling      agents with the resin. The displacement fluid is field salt water, having      a density of 9.1 ppg. A rat-hole fluid is placed below the resin and below      the depth at which perforations will be formed. This fluid is field salt      water with added salt to increase the density to 10.5 ppg. The fluids are      placed in the wellbore using a string of tubing open at the bottom which      can be lowered to any desired depth, using procedures well-known in the      art. The volume of treating resin is selected such that the perforations      to be formed will receive an effective amount of resin, selected to be 15      gallons per foot of the productive zone to be treated. The volume of      displacement fluid is selected to insure that pressure in the casing when      it is perforated will be higher than reservoir pressure. </PAR><PAR>  After the fluids are in place, a perforating gun is lowered on wire line to      the depth to be perforated. The perforating gun is designed for deep      penetration perforations. The perforating gun is fired and the fluid level      in the tubing drops. The tubing is refilled with field salt water and an      additional 20 barrels of water is pumped to displace resin into the      perforations. The perforating gun is pulled from the well. Sixty gallons      of 15 per cent hydrochloric acid per foot of productive zone is pumped      into the tubing and displaced with an additional 20 barrels of field salt      water. The acid causes the furan resin to polymerize and form a      consolidated volume of sand in the formation. The well produces oil and      water without sand in the produced fluids. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  In another embodiment of this invention well conditions are similar to      those in Example 1, but the resin is EPOSAND 112, which is an epoxy resin      mixture available from Shell Company. First, 100 gallons of a mixture of      an oil and carbon tetrachloride is placed in the well. This liquid has a      density higher than the 9.1 ppg of the resin solution. Then 212 gallons of      the resin solution is placed and the tubing is filled with diesel oil      having a density of 6.5 ppg. A perforating gun previously lowered into the      well is fired, the tubing is filled with diesel oil and 20 barrels      additional oil is pumped. The well is left undisturbed for 8 hours to      allow the resin to cure. The well is then produced without sand      production. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  A well in South Texas was to be recompleted in an unconsolidated or loosely      consolidated oil-containing sand above lower depleted sands. A bridge plug      was set in the 51/2 inch casing above the depleted sands. Tubing having      gas lift valves and a packer was run into the well and 212 gallons of      HYDROFIX furan resin solution was spotted above the bridge plug in the      casing. The resin solution contained 0.5 per cent surfactant, 50 per cent      diluent, and 0.5 per cent coupling agent by volume with the resin. The      resin was followed with field salt water pumped through the 27/8 inch      tubing. The packer was pulled up to a depth of 5000 feet and set. A 21/8      inch JUMBO JET perforating gun was run through the tubing to a depth of      5415 to 5421 feet, opposite the target sand. Nitrogen gas was injected      down the tubing until surface pressure in the tubing was 4000 psi. The      perforating gun was then fired to form four perforations per foot over a 6      foot interval. Pumping of nitrogen was commenced to pump 30 MCF of      nitrogen. The perforating gun was raised to 5200 feet and a mixture of      field salt water and nitrogen was injected with each phase at      approximately 0.5 barrels per minute. The field salt water was replaced      with 15 per cent hydrochloric acid and total rate increased to 1.5 barrels      per minute until 1,000 gallons of acid was injected. This acid-nitrogen      mixture was followed by field salt water to displace the nitrogen and kill      the well. The packer was then released and lowered to 5250 feet. The well      was placed on production with gas lift and tested. Production was free of      sand. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 4 </PAC><PAR>  A well located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico is completed in what is      expected to be an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated gas-bearing sand.      It is desired to test the well to determine its flow capacity. Therefore,      a sand consolidation treatment is needed which at least will temporarily      prevent flow of sand into the well when it is produced for testing. Also,      a small sand consolidation treatment when the well is perforated is      expected to improve the lifetime of a gravel pack in the well if      gravel-packing is needed later. The production casing is run from 11,000      feet to surface. Tubing is run into the well and 316 gallons of HYDROFIX      furan resin solution is spotted in the casing across the prospective      producing interval. Tubing is tripped out and back in to attach a VANN      tubing-conveyed perforating system and packer. The packer is positioned      and set to place the perforating guns with resin surrounding them across      the desired interval to be tested. The setting of the packer is tested and      the tubing is loaded with an additional 212 gallons of HYDROFIX furan      resin. Tubing is pressured with nitrogen to a pressure at the surface of      9,000 psi, resulting in a bottom-hole pressure of about 10,000 psi. A      delayed pressure-firing mechanism triggers the detonation of the guns and      the sand is perforated. Surface pressure drops to about 8,000 psi very      rapidly after perforating. Pumping of nitrogen begins at 10,000 cubic feet      per minute along with 3 barrels per minute of filtered brine. After 12      barrels of brine is pumped, 88 barrels of 10 per cent acetic acid is      pumped along with nitrogen. After the acid is pumped, nitrogen is      discontinued and tubing is flushed with filtered brine at 8 barrels per      minute. The well is placed on production and tested without sand. </PAR><PAR>  The methods of the present invention and its advantages will be understood      from the foregoing description and it will be apparent that many changes      may be made in the procedures thereof without departing from the spirit      and scope of the invention, the forms herein described being merely      preferred or exemplary embodiments. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
