But numerous obstacles remain, and a quick release of all the hostages doesn't seem to be in the cards, though some analysts note that Iran is unpredictable and that few had anticipated Tehran's dramatic decision to join U.N.-sponsored cease-fire talks.    Iranian officials have encouraged hopes about the hostages, suggesting last week that the Americans being held might be freed if the U.S. released Iranian assets that were frozen after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.    But the Reagan administration, still stinging from the revelation that it secretly sold missiles and other arms to Iran in hopes of releasing the hostages, seems uninterested in another round of &quot;secret&quot; negotiations, which officials say probably wouldn't remain secret very long, should they start. And Secretary of State George Shultz said this week that while the U.S. was interested in discussing the hostages with Iran, it would refuse to link the return of Iranian assets to any hostage release.    More important, unlike the Americans held captive in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the hostages in Lebanon aren't being held by Iranians. Their captor is a Lebanese Shiite terrorist named Imad Mugniyah, who isn't interested in Iran's frozen assets. What he wants for his hostages is the release of his wife's brother and two other Lebanese terrorists, who are under sentence of death in Kuwait for their 1984 bombing attack against the U.S. and French embassies.    In 1985 and 1986, three Americans were freed in exchange for arms secretly sold to Iran by Israel and the U.S., clearly indicating Iran's influence over the hostage holders -- influence it might be willing to use in its new good-will campaign.    But U.S. intelligence officials doubt that Tehran can simply order Mr. Mugniyah to give back all his pawns while his brother-in-law and two colleagues -- one of whom is a cousin of another Lebanese Shiite terrorist leader -- remain in a Kuwaiti prison. Even the terrorists' Lebanese spiritual mentor, Sheik Hussein Fadlallah, concedes that he hasn't been able to convince members of his flock to free American journalist Terry Anderson, a captive since March 16, 1985.    It isn't clear how a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq would motivate the Kuwaitis to free Mr. Mugniyah's brother-in-law now. The Kuwaitis have taken a hard line on the issue since another group of Shiite terrorists tried to assassinate their ruler in 1985. To make matters worse, U.S. officials say Mr. Mugniyah, who allegedly was involved in the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847, was behind the hijacking of a Kuwaiti jetliner earlier this year, in which two Kuwaiti security guards were murdered.    Still, if Iran and Iraq do stop the shooting, an opening of sorts could present itself in February. At that time, five-year prison sentences will expire for some members of the Iraqi Shiite terror group that helped carry out the 1984 bombings in Kuwait. But Mr. Mugniyah's in-law and his two Lebanese comrades aren't among those scheduled to be released.    Finally, the Iranian officials who have forced the radical shift in their country's war policy, led by parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, may have less influence over their country's terrorist allies than do more-radical politicians. Sorting out who controls what in the Iranian terror apparatus isn't easy: One chart drawn up by the Defense Intelligence Agency puts &quot;God&quot; in the top box, just above the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with several separate terror networks all reporting separately to Mr. Khomeini.    Mr. Mugniyah's patrons in Tehran, intelligence officials say, are all radicals, including Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi-Pur, Revolutionary Guard Minister Mohsen Rafiq-Dust, and Deputy Foreign Minister Hosein Sheikholislam, a California-educated veteran of the U.S. Embassy seizure. So far, intelligence officials say, there isn't any sign that the overlapping world-wide terror networks these officials direct are slowing down, much less going out of business. </TEXT></DOC>
