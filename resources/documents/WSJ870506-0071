It remains to be seen, though, whether illegal immigrants and the Immigration and Naturalization Service will successfully negotiate a thicket of emotional legal issues. It was apparent as the new law took effect that many immigrant families may be wrenchingly divided by the new law, and that suspicion remains great among the immigrants whom the law is intended to benefit.    In Los Angeles, Houston and elsewhere, INS officials yesterday began distributing and processing applications for temporary legal-resident status to thousands of the estimated 3.9 million illegal immigrants thought by the INS to be eligible for amnesty under the new law.    The law, signed by President Reagan Nov. 6, offers the chance to obtain legal status if an immigrant who illegally entered the U.S. can prove he or she has resided here with few absences since Jan. 1, 1982. A second phase of the law, penalizing employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, begins taking effect in two stages on June 1.    &quot;This is a new beginning for several million people in this country who seek to share in the American way of life and the American dream,&quot; proclaimed Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, the nation's leading immigrant mecca.    But for many of the illegals themselves, it was still a day of tension. &quot;I might qualify. I might not,&quot; said Salvador Garcia, holding three envelopes brimming with paycheck stubs and W-2 forms that he had never filed -- all intended to show that he lived continuously in the U.S. for the last five years. &quot;If I don't qualify, I'll go to &quot;mi tierra&quot; -- his homeland, in Mexico.    But not nearly as many immigrants showed up the first day as had been expected. The wait-and-see attitude among wary illegal immigrants was typified by Rudolfo Aspara Contreras, a native of Michoacan, Mexico, who spent the morning observing a line of applicants outside a Houston processing center. &quot;I'll come with my papers another day,&quot; he said sarcastically. &quot;They can deceive me.&quot;    The distribution of applications, and the processing of the few turned in yesterday, appeared to go smoothly in most locations. The INS had braced for a crush of applicants; in Houston, for instance, when long lines began forming a day early, officials passed out applications to about 1,000 before the law actually took effect. And in Los Angeles, the downtown INS center ran out of required fingerprint forms for 3 1/2 hours.    But nearly everyone -- from officials of the INS to the activists who feel the law is too restrictive -- was also ready to create theater from the occasion. To mollify immigrant distrust of the enforcement-minded &quot;la migra,&quot; the INS adorned processing centers nationwide with foot-tall replicas of Lady Liberty.    The first immigrants to complete applications and receive a much valued red work-authorization card were trotted before platoons of press people. In Houston, Romelia Salazar de Ortiz spent more than an hour with INS officials -- and then as much time fielding a barrage of bilingual questions from reporters.    &quot;You are our victim,&quot; joked one reporter in Spanish.    &quot;Or your star,&quot; she quipped in Spanish.    Some activists yesterday were far less upbeat. Antonio Rodriguez, a well-known immigration-rights advocate, chained himself to the gates of a federal deportation center in Los Angeles to protest &quot;the inhumane manner&quot; in which the law potentially can separate families. He and 12 others were quickly arrested.    Although the protesters' methods were dramatic, their concern is widely shared. Some immigration experts estimate that as many as 25% of prospective applicants are from families in which only one parent may qualify for amnesty. The possibility of widespread forced separation is already causing grave concern from the barrios of East Los Angeles to the Latin American consulate offices in Houston, which yesterday held a joint news conference to draw attention to the issue.    Three bills now pending in Congress would keep families united even if not all members qualify for amnesty. INS district directors now have some discretion about deporting spouses or parents of illegals who may qualify. &quot;What we need is something quick,&quot; said Isaias Torres, a Houston immigration attorney, &quot;so that district directors do use their discretion favorably.&quot;    Latino leaders aired other anxieties. For example, the application forms distributed by the INS are printed entirely in English. &quot;The immigrants are startled,&quot; said Antonia Hernandez, general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. In addition, applicants are required to list the names and addresses of all next of kin, including those who may reside illegally in the U.S. but who couldn't qualify for amnesty.    Some academics are again predicting that the loss of cheap labor resulting from the departure of immigrants unable to remain under the new law will lead to rising consumer costs and a slowdown in the economic growth of Southern California. In certain industries, fast-food chains, hotels and tourism, &quot;there is a possibility we could see economic stagnation and more severe implications,&quot; said Leo Chavez, a research associate at the Center of U.S.-Mexican Studies in San Diego.    Although nearly three-quarters of prospective applicants are Latino -- the majority of them from Mexico -- the law stirred hopes for legal residency among immigrants from a multiplicity of ethnic origins: Irish in New York, Polish in Chicago and Filipinos in the San Joaquin Valley of California, among many others.    A Nigerian awaiting an application in Houston said he legally entered the U.S. on a three-week visitors' visa seven years ago, but has been afraid even to &quot;step out of here&quot; and risk not regaining entry. He hopes eventually to relocate his children to the U.S. &quot;I have only seen my kids by photos,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
