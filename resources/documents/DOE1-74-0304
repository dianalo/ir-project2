Two isozymic alanine racemases,encoded by the dadB gene and the alr gene, from the Gram-negative mesophilicSalmonella typhimurium and one from the Gram-positive thermophilic Bacillusstearothermophilus have been examined for the racemization mechanism.Substrate deuterium isotope effects and solvent deuterium isotope effectshave been measured in both L {yields} D and D{yields} L directions forall three enzymes to assess the degree to which abstraction of the {alpha}-protonor protonation of substrate PLP carbanion is limiting in catalysis. Additionally,experiments measuring internal return of {alpha}-{sup 3}H from substrateto product and solvent exchange/substrate conversion experiments in {sup3}H{sub 2}O have been used with each enzyme to examine the partitioningof substrate PLP carbanion intermediates and to obtain the relative heightsof kinetically significant energy barriers in alanine racemase catalysis.</TEXT></DOC>
