Mr. Jackson's sudden financial success injects a new element into the campaign, giving him the ability to buy competitive amounts of broadcast advertising for the first time. A Jackson spokesman said the campaign is banking funds to buy television commercials for the April 19 New York primary. The campaign has spent only about $400,000 for commercials until now, while his Democratic rivals have spent several million each.    Donations to Mr. Jackson in March, which were double his take in February, included $1 million in small gifts raised through direct-mail and telephone solicitations. Mal Warwick, a consultant to Mr. Jackson, said small-donor income rose 150% from February, increasing as the public absorbed Mr. Jackson's string of electoral successes starting March 8, Super Tuesday. &quot;The response is overwhelming,&quot; Mr. Warwick said.    Total contributions collected by the Jackson campaign in March exceeded those collected by Sen. Albert Gore, the third man in the race. His campaign took in about $1.2 million in March, as well as borrowing nearly $1.5 million from banks around Super Tuesday, a spokesman said. The campaign is willing to borrow even more but hasn't done so, he added.    Before March, the Jackson campaign had raised a total of $3.4 million in donations, compared with $12.2 million raised by Mr. Dukakis and $4.8 million by Mr. Gore. Counting federal matching-fund subsidies, total receipts through Feb. 29 were $5.2 million for Mr. Jackson, $18 million for Mr. Dukakis and $7.5 million for Mr. Gore. </TEXT></DOC>
