The Bush administration plans to ask Congress next year to givePeru, Bolivia and Colombia more money to counter economic lossescaused by their efforts to stem the drug trade that is thelifeblood for many farmers.   The proposal was outlined Wednesday in a document released byBernard Aronson, deputy secretary of state for Latin Americanaffairs.   Aronson was in Lima to discuss with Garcia the agenda for a Feb.15 drug summit involving Garcia, President Bush, and presidentsVirgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia. Thesummit is to be held in Cartagena, Colombia.   Garcia hailed the proposal as a ``change in perspective'' by theUnited States. He said it marks a ``new epoch'' in economic andanti-drug collaboration between the countries.   The document, a preliminary agenda for the summit, outlinedother themes to be discussed, including:   _ Military and police aid to fight drug smugglers.   _ Leftist guerrillas' ties to the narcotics trade.   _ Crop eradication and substitution programs.   _ Cooperation in extraditing drug suspects and stopping thelaundering of drug money.   The document did not specify how much aid would be involved andexactly what form it would take.   ``The United States is open to considering support in thebalance of payments, such as subsidizing imports and contributingto debt service with international financial institutions,'' thedocument said.   It also left open the possibility of financing alternative cropprograms through research assistance and credits to establishmarkets for new products.   Bolivia and Peru produce 90 percent of the world's coca leaf.Most is transformed into paste and shipped to Colombia, where it isrefined into cocaine. The drug trade brings billions of dollarsinto the three countries each year, and regional leaders have saidthey need the aid to help them find substitute sources of income.   Bush's earlier had proposed $2.2 billion during the next fiveyears for the three Andean nations, including $261 million thefirst year, mostly in military and police aid.   Garcia criticized that proposal, saying Bush was trying to turna social and economic problem into a military one. Garcia said itwas necessary to open markets and find ways to help peasant cocagrowers earn a living from other crops.   Peru, the source of 60 percent to 70 percent of the world's cocaleaf, was designated to receive only $73 million of the $261million in the first year of the program, compared to $90 millionfor Colombia and $98 million for Bolivia.   The proposal included only $3 million in aid for Peru the firstyear. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the amount for Peru was lowbecause of its unstable economy. The spokesman said officials wereworried economic assistance would not be spent efficiently.   Inflation the last 12 months in Peru was 2,950 percent.   However, an agreement was recently signed opening a new line ofcredit with the International Monetary Fund and committing Peru tomake payments on its $1 billion debt with the fund. The fund cutoff credit in 1986 after Garcia declared a moratorium on interestpayments.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler said the rapprochementindicated Peru's desire to stabilize its economy. He described itas an essential step in opening the door to U.S. economic aid.</TEXT></DOC>
