In the first instance, the operatortook stock of the technical problems which could have affected the safetyof the plant or restricted availability in the short and medium term.The analysis did not point to any serious problems for the five yearsahead. The periodic economic review of electricity generating capacitycarried out in 1983 the Direction de la Production et du Transport d'Electricitede France showed that the optimal date for decommissioning Chinon A2was July 1985. The fact that this coincided exactly with the transferdate for personnel in this neighbouring units B3 and B4 (2x900 MWe -PWR) was the additional deciding factor for decommissioning in 1985.Taking the decision early enough enabled the operator to optimise theuse both of fuel and of reactor staff. The authors then discuss the disposaloptions for the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
