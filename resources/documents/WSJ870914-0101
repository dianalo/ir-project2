The exact number of jobs that will be eliminated couldn't be learned. However, one Chemical Bank source said the number could be as high as 2,000 jobs. The jobs would be eliminated through a combination of normal attrition, early retirements and layoffs.    Chemical Bank has about 21,000 employees. The cutbacks reportedly won't effect the 7,000 employees at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., which Chemical acquired earlier this year.    A Chemical spokesman yesterday declined to confirm or deny that layoffs will occur as part of a reorganization. However, Chemical employees said that rumors have been circulating for several weeks that the cutbacks were coming.    The cutback comes as major banks face mounting pressures to cut expenses and raise their equity levels. The most recent example of this pressure came during the second quarter, when most major banks posted their biggest losses ever. The banks reported the losses after having boosted their loan-loss reserves to cover the doubtful repayment of debt by Latin American countries.    For the second quarter, Chemical had a $1.1 billion loss after announcing in June that it was increasing its loan-loss reserve by $1.1 billion. In the second quarter of 1986 Chemical earned $98.3 million.    These reserve additions have cut deeply into banks' financial cushions -- their common equity levels. Now they are searching for ways to rebuild their equity to pre-reserve levels.    Some banks, including Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., have announced new offerings of common stock totaling $1.5 billion to replenish their equity bases.    For now, Chemical, which has an acquisition pending for Horizon Bancorp., New Jersey's fifth-largest bank holding company, has chosen not to issue new stock but to cut expenses. Other big New York banks, notably Manufacturers Hanover, have been paring back their work forces in recent months and selling assets to reduce expenses and replenish their equity levels. </TEXT></DOC>
