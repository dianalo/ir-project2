The authors evaluated 39 patients with biopsy-provedesophageal carcinoma to determine whether sensitivity would change iflateral views were used. Tumor location and size, number of lesions,and extension were determined at surgery (n = 19), endoscopy, and CTimaging of the chest (n = 38). They found that lateral images of thethorax are most sensitive in the detection of esophageal carcinoma. Thelow sensitivities for Ga-67 imaging reported in the literature are probablydue to the exclusive utilization of anterior and posterior projections.</TEXT></DOC>
