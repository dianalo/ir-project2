An outline is given of the typesof coal found in Australia, their location, amount and use. It is shownthat bituminous coals produce ashes which are mainly refractory, anddo not cause extensive problems in power plants: rather the efficientcollection and effective disposal of these ashes requires the most attention.On the other hand brown coals have low ash yields, but their ashes havesignificant potential for fouling and corroding boiler surfaces: hencemost control effort is directed to the reduction of these problems. Pastand present research in Australia has been, and is being, successfulin developing suitable strategies for ash control in power plant operation,and in giving adequate characterization of the behaviour of ash producedfrom export coals. Examples are given of the way research has solvedfull-scale problems, and the way current research and development areensuring satisfactory control of ash behaviour. The paper concludes byshowing how present research is helping towards the development of advancedenergy conversion cycles, to give improved efficiency, economy and environmentalcontrol. 38 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
