The diplomat said the 2nd Army's commanding general, a leader ofthe military revolt that began Tuesday, had been killed in thefactional fighting.   The 2nd Army had been considered in full opposition to Mengistu,and the fighting with loyalists inside the 2nd Army representedwhat the diplomat, based in Addis Ababa, called ``a dramatic turn.''   Mengistu said in a broadcast Thursday night that ``a few of theconspiracy's collaborators attempted to continue the betrayal,''but the 2nd Army ``has today crushed the traitors ... and hasbrought the situation under full control.''   In his first public comment since since returning Wednesday froman abbreviated trip to East Germany, Mengistu said his``revolutionary forces will liquidate'' the mutineers.   He blamed the uprising ``on a few generals'' who placed their``greed and hunger for power'' above the natonal interest. Therevolt is the most serious challenge to Mengistu's 15-year-old rulein Ethiopia, the Soviet Union's closest ally in Africa.   The diplomat said loyal soldiers at least temporarily recapturedthe radio station in Asmara, capital of the northern province, andbroadcast a statement declaring loyalty to the Marxist government.   ``The radio station then went dead,'' he said, which suggestedcontinued fighting between loyalists and mutineers in Ethiopia'ssecond largest city. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.   A few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd Army,the Eritrean People's Liberation Front declared it was suspendingits 28-year-old war of secession to support the mutineers.   The diplomat said the factional fighting ``may be a backlashagainst the rapprochement with the EPLF.''   Voice of the Masses of Eritrea, the rebel radio, announced aunilateral, two-week cease-fire ``to facilitate the successfuloutcome'' of the military revolt. The clandestine station reportedearlier that rebel leaders had met with 2nd Army commanders and``discussed the best way to intensify the struggle.''   Mutineers have not stated an ideology or political goals beyondousting Mengistu. The government and Eritrean rebels both espouseMarxism.   On Thursday night, the radio reported fighting ``among Ethiopianarmy units in and around Asmara'' and reiterated rebel ``readinessto give any kind of support and cooperation'' to the mutineers.   It offered ``the entire area under the control of the EPLF as afallback zone'' for the mutinous troops. The radio also reportedrenewed fighting in Addis Ababa, but the diplomat said there hadbeen no shooting in Addis Ababa.   Any alliance between the Eritrean rebels and a fully rebellious2nd Army would remove all government control from Ethiopia'snorthernmost province, its only avenue to the Red Sea, andpresumably force Mengistu to negotiate.   The rebels control three-fourths of the countryside in Eritrea,and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities,including Asmara.   The diplomat said the counterrevolt within the 2nd Army, whichnumbers about 150,000 men, was led by a tank brigade and aparatrooper unit. He identified the slain commander as DenissieBulto, a ``key ringleader'' in the plot against Mengistu.   State radio said Thursday that Industry Ministry Fanta Belai hadbeen arrested as one of the plotters. He formerly commanded the airforce.   Mengistu's defense minister, Maj. Gen. Haile Giorgis HabteMariam, and at least two rebellious generals have been killed.   Unconfirmed reports said a fourth coup leader, Maj. Gen.Kumalafchew Dejene, the deputy commander of armed forces inEritrea, was hunted down Wednesday and killed by loyalist soldiers.   Government troops have been completely forced out of neighboringTigre Province by rebels of the Tigre People's Liberation Front,who want more autonomy in their area.   Although their aims are different, the rebel groups occasionallycombine forces and in the past year dealt the government severalhumiliating defeats. Tigrean rebels also have voiced support forthe dissident soldiers.   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studiesputs the strength of the Ethiopian army at 315,000, that ofEritrean rebels at 30,000 men and Tigrean rebels at 20,000. All theforces have tanks and artillery.   In addition, air force units assigned to the north had abouthalf the government's estimated 140 MiG fighter jets and bombers.   It is not known which side the air force units took, but thedissident soldiers were reported in control of Asmara's airport,and the government has warned civilian pilots not to fly over thecity.   Mengistu inherited the 28-year-old northern civil war when heand a clique of army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie onSept. 12, 1974.   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated withEthiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. HaileSelassie annexed the territory in 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
