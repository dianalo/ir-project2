Iran claimed it had shot down the helicopter during a sea battlethat raged Monday over much of the southern gulf.   Iran fired five land-based missiles at U.S. warships duringMonday's fighting, in which American forces destroyed two Iranianoil platforms and blasted six Iranian vessels.   Navy officers identified the missiles as Chinese-made Silkwormsbut the Pentagon said it had yet to confirm what kind of missileswhistled past the warships.   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toldPresident Reagan and Republican Congressional leaders that therewas no evidence Iran had fired any Silkworms, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said.   In avoiding the missiles, the three-ship convoy led by the USSJack Williams took evasive action and fired chaff into the air,which confused the rockets' radar guidance system and caused themissiles to miss the convoy in the southern gulf.   Monday's confrontation was the most serious between U.S. andIranian forces since the U.S. Navy sent its task force to the gulflast year.   Reagan today said the gulf ``seems to be quieting down.''   Gulf-based maritime salvage experts reported the Iraniansattacked two tankers in the Strait of Hormuz today. Monday theyfired on three neutral ships.   The salvage experts said one of the two tankers put out adistress signal at midmorning and gave its name as Meltem. Theycould not secure additional details.   The other tanker, the 12,125-ton Fal-5 from the United ArabEmirates, was set ablaze but Omani coastguard patrol boats rescuedthe crew.   Mines were spoted by a passing vessel in a central gulf areawhere no explosives had earlier been noted, and shipping executivespredicted commercial vessels would be discouraged from sailing inthe region.   Sources close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said the convoys of11 U.S. reflagged Kuwaiti tankers sailing under U.S. Navyprotection were discontinued until a major shipping channel furthernorth was cleared.   However, the Pentagon denied that the convoys had been suspended.   The Pentagon said Monday that U.S raids on the Iranian oilplatforms came in retaliation for a mine strike last Thursdayagainst the USS Samuel B. Roberts, which injured 10 crewmen.   Iran said several people were killed or injured in the raids onthe two oil platforms but gave no further details. It has denyingplanting the mines.   No American casualties were reported in Monday's fighting.However, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said in Washington theNavy was searching for a Cobra attack helicopter with two crewmenthat had not returned to a cruiser.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inCyprus, said Monday night that Iranian warships ``in a heroic clashwith the aggressor American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shotdown one of them Monday afternoon.''   Pentagon officials said the helicopter did not return to the USSWainwright Monday after a ``routine reconnaissance mission.''   The Pentagon identified the helicopter crew as Capt. Stephen C.Leslie, of New Bern, N.C., and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, ofThomasville, N.C. They were assigned to the Marine Corps AirStation in New River, N.C.   In its latest report on Monday's fighting, Iran claimed Iraniangunboats sank a U.S. ship Monday in the southern gulf.   ``Iranian speedboats spotted and scored direct hits on anAmerican naval logistical ship sailing in the region, sinking thevessel with all its crew aboard,'' the agency said today.   The Pentagon reiterated today that there were no confirmedcasualties Monday.   Asked about the Iranian report of an American ship being sunk,Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said: ``No report has reached us fromour forces in the gulf of any hostile acts today.''   The missile attack Monday represented the first reported firingof the Silkworm batteries along Iran's coast at ships in thesouthern gulf or the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway's narrowentrance.   The attack was witnessed by Associated Press correspondentRichard Pyle who was aboard the Williams with a Pentagon news mediapool.   Fighting began early Monday when the U.S. Navy blasted twoIranian oil platforms as a ``measured response'' to mining of theRoberts.   U.S. forces then sank an Iranian gunboat defending theplatforms. Later Monday, two Iranian navy frigates fired on U.S.jets, which then bombed the ships, setting them afire near theStrait of Hormuz.   U.S. warships also sank one and damaged two other patrol boatsattacking neutral shipping near the Mubarak oil field, off theemirate of Sharjah in the southern gulf.   During the raid at Mubarak, Iranian forces attacked American,British and Cypriot merchant vessels and a press helicopter.   About an hour after midnight Sunday, two groups of U.S. Navywarships struck the Iranian oil platforms Sassan and Sirri-D, 100miles apart in the southern gulf.   One platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other byexplosives placed on it by Marines, according to statements inWashington.   Carlucci said a Navy helicopter was fired upon during the raidon the platforms but not hit. Iranians shot at a press helicoptercarrying an NBC-TV crew and Associated Press photographer NorbertSchiller, but missed.   Schiller reported today that the Sassan and Sirri-D platformshad been reduced to charred ruins and appeared abandoned after theU.S. attack.   After the platform attack, an Iranian patrol boat fired at theU.S. cruiser Wainwright, one of the attacking ships, but missed.The frigate Simpson sank the Iranian boat, the Pentagon said.   In late afternoon, the Iranian frigates, the Sahand and theSabalan, were hit by American bombs and missiles after they firedon U.S. jets.</TEXT></DOC>
