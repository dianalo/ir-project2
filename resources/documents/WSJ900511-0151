Trachtenberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><CO>   KM DH MA LTD CHH GPS</CO><IN>BROADLINE RETAILERS, DEPARTMENT STORES (RTB)SPECIALTY APPAREL RETAILERS (SAP)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- Some of the nation's top specialty retailersreported strong April sales gains, but comparable-store salesincreases for the combined March and April selling periodsaveraged only 5.6%.   April sales this year were inflated by the addition ofEaster-related revenue. Last year Easter occurred in March.Still, Gap Inc. showed sales increases of 25% for stores openat least one year, while Limited Inc. reportedcomparable-store gains of 16%. For the 13 weeks endedSaturday, Gap's comparable-store sales rose 18%, whileLimited showed 11% gains.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Many department stores have undergone financialrestructuring, and they've become much less willing to takechances on fashion merchandise,&quot; said Barry Bryant, analystat Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;The result is thatstores like Gap and Limited, which are clearly focused, aredoing well.&quot;   Meanwhile, at K mart Corp., comparable-store sales,including foreign, rose 6.3% for the four weeks ended May 2and 3% for the 13 weeks ended May 2.   &quot;Sales were strong in April, aided by the later date forEaster in 1990 and by favorable weather conditions throughoutmuch of the East and Midwest,&quot; said K mart's chairman andchief executive officer, Joseph E. Antonini. &quot;Seasonalmerchandise in both hardline {appliances} and appareldepartments sold well during the April period.&quot;   Robert Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc.,Baltimore, said the company's performance was in line withits plan.   &quot;Markdowns weren't significantly higher than last year,&quot;said Mr. Buchanan. &quot;If you add March and April, however,comparable-store sales were up about 2.5%, far behindWal-Mart Stores Inc., which is up about 9.5% for the twomonths. It's safe to say that K mart continues to lose marketshare to some of its better-focused competitors.&quot;   Mr. Buchanan noted that K mart's expense ratio -- selling,general and administrative expenses in relation to sales --is 23% for its discount stores, compared with only 15% forWal-Mart's discount stores and 16% for the Target discountdivision of Dayton Hudson Corp. &quot;This makes it tougher for Kmart to price competitively across the board, and still earna high return on sales.&quot;   Mr. Buchanan noted that specialty retailers continue totake market share because of superior execution. &quot;It'spossible some of the big department stores are playing it toosafe,&quot; said Mr. Buchanan. &quot;The Limited in particular isenjoying strong sales. Its Express division was up 28% on acomparable-store basis in April, and Victoria's Secret was up41% on a comparable-store basis. Even Lane Bryant rose 18% ona same-store basis. Overall Limited is aggressive, fullystocked, and their visual presentation is better than thecompetition.&quot;   Business at Dayton Hudson, which recently agreed toacquire Marshall Field's, continued to be good.Comparable-store sales rose 5.5% for the four weeks endedSaturday and 6.8% for the 13 weeks ended Saturday.   &quot;Given the Easter shift this year, it's meaningful to lookat the results for March and April combined,&quot; said Kenneth A.Macke, chairman and chief executive. &quot;Total sales for thetwo-month period were up 13.5%, and comparable-store saleswere up 7%.&quot;   ---                Four-week period ended May 5                                                                                                                                a-'90 sales   '89 sales      b-%                         millions      millions     change                                                                                                         c-K mart ...........   2,312.2       1,993.3      16.0  d-Dayton Hudson ....     947.0         847.0      11.7  e-May Dept.
