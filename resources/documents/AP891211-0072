Between 1,600 and 4,000 National Guard soldiers in the state areabsent without leave and should be dismissed, the New York Postsaid.   No-shows are not paid, but the Pentagon sets minimum manpowerrequirements and provides funds for equipment and training based onthose numbers.   The newspaper said its investigation concluded that the phantomforce was created in 1984 by Vito Castellano, commander of the NewYork state guard from 1975 to 1986 who became ensnared in theWedtech scandal.   Castellano was released from prison in July after serving oneyear for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for Wedtech,the defunct defense contractor.   Castellano could not be reached today for comment on the Postreport. Calls this morning to a telephone listed in his name in aNew York suburb went unanswered.   Lt. Col. James O'Toole, the state Guard's personnel director,said ``probably'' about 1,600 Guard members should be dischargedfor absenteeism. But reports indicated the figure may be muchhigher. Federal regulations say soldiers with nine unexcusedabsences must be dismissed.   A congressional report said that in the 1988 New York Guardtraining session, absenteeism was 32 percent, the Post said.   And a confidential Guard report, a military personnel profilefor its New York City division, the 42nd, showed that 3,367guardsmen have been absent from drills and training sessions atleast nine times, the newspaper said.   Maj. Gen. Lawrence P. Flynn, commander of the state Guard, saidhe was keeping no-shows on the roster, despite the rules, in hopesthey could be restored to active duty. It is cheaper thanrecruiting new soldiers, he said.   He could not provide figures on how many absentee guardsmen hadreturned to duty.   If the absentees are dismissed, the Pentagon will have toclassify New York as unprepared for combat, according to the report.   The New York National Guard already has the second worstattendance records in the nation, but its budget has tripled since1975 to $390 million, the newspaper said.   The newspaper quoted an unidentified former top Castellano aideas saying that Castellano ordered absentee guardsmen kept on theroster.</TEXT></DOC>
