Issued in West German marks, Swiss francs and U.S. dollars, the bonds carry warrants to buy shares of parent company Continental AG of Hanover, West Germany. They were designed by Deutsche Bank AG so that the warrants can be stripped from the bonds and traded separately.    In addition, the company announced it will raise about 700 million marks ($388 million) through two new share issues that will be completed in the next two months.    The tire manufacturer will be using the proceeds of the bond and share issues to finance the acquisition of the General Tire unit of GenCorp Inc. of the U.S. for $650 million.    Speaking above the noise of popping champagne corks late yesterday, one Deutsche Bank manager said he was pleased with the investor response to all three issues. Deutsche Bank was the lead manager for the mark and dollar issues. Union Bank of Switzerland led the Swiss franc portion.    One Deutsche Bank official said, &quot;We were pleasantly surprised,&quot; and attributed the response to the long-term bullish view of the market on Continental's shares. &quot;People are positive about Conti and the stock market in West Germany over a longer term,&quot; he said.    Traders bid 10 points over the 134 issue price of the 190 million mark portion, which carries a coupon of 6 3/4% and is due 1997.    The $75 million portion of 9 3/4% bonds traded as high as 148, before dropping back to end the day at 143, some 13 points above its issue price.    Performing similarly was the 100 million Swiss franc ($67 million) portion of 4 3/4% bonds due 2002.    Managers studying the issues attribute the strong market response to the lack of new issues seen in the mark sector and to investor preference for equity-related deals in all three markets at a time of rising interest rates.    The exercise price on the warrants, set at 360 marks for all three bonds, can be lowered if the share placement price for Continental is lower, officials said.    For trading purposes, the warrants can be stripped from the bonds immediately on the payment date, Oct. 6. The warrants can begin to be exercised four weeks later.    Meanwhile, Eurodollar bond prices fell sharply along with U.S. Treasury bonds, but several major borrowers managed successful launches of bonds with equity conversion features or non-dollar denominations.    In secondary markets, dealers marked fixed-coupon Eurodollar bonds down from 3/8 to one point during what some characterized as a &quot;gloomy day.&quot;    &quot;At some point, the markets will get into an oversold state and we'll have a technical rally,&quot; said Peter Getsinger, an executive director at Shearson Lehman Brothers International.    But at present, he added, the outlook for the Eurodollar bond market isn't positive, with yields seemingly edging up about 10 to 15 basis points a day.    A new-issues specialist at a U.S. house characterized the dollar-denominated bond market as &quot;pretty sick.&quot; Still, several borrowers were said to be watching for opportunities to launch fixed-coupon issues. Among them reportedly is Sweden, which is believed to be considering a five-year issue as big as $200 million.    Despite a significant decline in Japanese equities, dealers reported strong interest in Matsushita Electric Works Ltd.'s $300 million of five-year Eurobonds with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 3% coupon at par.    The borrower is a Japanese maker of electronic materials and controls, not the consumer electronics giant, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The similarity in names may have been confusing to some participants.    An official at Yamaichi International (Europe) Ltd., which led the Matsushita Electric Works bonds, noted that the recent volatility in equities markets had made launch conditions difficult to gauge. But, he said, &quot;The bonds should perform very well.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
