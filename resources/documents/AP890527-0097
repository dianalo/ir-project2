Baker III on Saturday and pledged anewto end white domination of blacks in his country.   Baker and Botha also discussed a planned visit to Washington byF.W. DeKlerk, the leader of South Africa's governing National Partyand the man expected to become the country's president later thisyear.   Baker, in a brief exchange with reporters after the meeting,ssid Botha had ``indicated to us it is the intention of the SouthAfrican government to abolish the system of apartheid and we werepleased to hear that.''   Botha concurred. ``We are in the process of reform, and we aredismantling apartheid, and we accept that white domination mustend,'' Both said.   He said the decision was taken by the South African governmentfor its own policy reasons and not in response to outside pressures.   ``It's going to be done in consultation with black leaders,''Botha said.   Later, the White House issued a statement saying Botha had toldBaker his party would campaign for the South African presidencywith the view that ``the days of white domination are over.''   The statement said Baker raised questions about denial of humanand civil rights of black South Africans, individual cases ofdetention and restrictions on freedom of travel.   ``The secretary said that the U.S. government intended to engagewith a full range of black and white South Africans in an effort towork towards the goal of producing peaceful abolition ofapartheid,'' the statement added.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that in view of thegovernment changes coming up in South Africa, Baker had taken``this opportunity to explore any possible changes that might betaking place in the policies of that government at this time.''   The invitation to De Klerk, who would be the first top SouthAfrican leader to visit Washington in 30 years, and a meeting Bushhad earlier this month with anti-apartheid leaders, are part of aU.S. initiative to increase contacts with South Africa.   The United States also appears to be seeking to keep up with theSoviet Union, which has been meeting with South African activistsacross the political spectrum.   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen was scheduled to meetin Rome with his Soviet counterpart this weekend to discuss theSouth African changes and other developments.</TEXT></DOC>
