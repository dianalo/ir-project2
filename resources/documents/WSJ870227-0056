As Mr. Johns is one of the most closely watched artists in America, the exhibition of these four encaustic panels has aroused great interest; the crowds at the gallery this past weekend were about as thick as they ever get, and abuzz with chatter about the complex symbolism of the pictures, which are at the same time both a summation of much of Mr. Johns's earlier imagery and a radical departure from it.    That the pictures were meant to be highly symbolical and to constitute a kind of artistic autobiography is unquestionable. They are jam packed with diverse art historical references -- to Picasso, to Duchamp, to Japanese prints, and to Mr. Johns's own earlier work, among others, and also allude to literature and philosophy. In &quot;Spring&quot; a decoy duck is meant to refer to a passage in Wittgenstein. In &quot;Summer&quot; a reproduction of the Mona Lisa is set cheek by jowl with images of Mr. Johns's own 48-star American flags. In &quot;Autumn&quot; a broken mirror with a skull and crossbones on it refers to Marcel Duchamp's famous &quot;Large Glass,&quot; which so influenced Mr. Johns over the years.    What is infinitely more interesting than the deciphering of complicated symbolic codes in &quot;The Seasons&quot; is the recognition that in them Mr. Johns has radically changed the structure of his picture making. These paintings embody a notion of time and happening that is quite different from Mr. Johns's earlier pictures, and they also signal a more directly expressed relationship between his art and his life. Taken together, the four paintings not only evoke the traditional allegory of the Ages of Man, but also personalize that abstract allegory with surprising intensity, and with tragic overtones.    The &quot;Seasons&quot; paintings, made in reaction to a move to a new house and studio, specifically refer to parts of Mr. Johns's various houses and studios. They seem to be his first works to evoke a fairly tangible environment, and his first attempts at something like actual narrative. Mr. Johns's earlier work was usually limited to deadpan renderings of common objects, removed from a specific space or time-emblematic images of American flags, maps, and targets, for example. Such common, signlike, and impersonal imagery gave Mr. Johns automatic emotional distance from his subjects, and that distancing was one of the hallmarks of his art.    The &quot;Seasons&quot; paintings, on the other hand, are specifically autobiographical. And as if to drive that point home, Mr. Johns has gone so far as to include himself in them, as a looming shadow. The gray, ghostlike image of the artist (based on an actual tracing of Mr. Johns's shadow by a friend) moves through these pictures like a disconsolate double. In &quot;Spring&quot; it hovers in a passageway at the center of the picture, in the midst of a driving rain. In &quot;Summer&quot; it is set in front of a stone wall, leaning against the left side of the picture, as if about to slide out of our sight. In &quot;Autumn&quot; the figure is split in two, and seems to stand sentinel to the motley array of broken household objects that are flanked by its divided halves. In &quot;Winter&quot; the wraithlike figure stands in the midst of softly falling snow, ironically juxtaposed with a childlike rendering of a snowman. Here the figure of the artist is nearly transparent and seems to be disappearing before our very eyes, evoking melancholy and loss.    This last, I think, is the most successful painting in the set, and one of the most affecting paintings that Mr. Johns has ever done. While the first three &quot;Seasons&quot; paintings tend, for all their iconographic complexity, to be a bit lifeless, the &quot;Winter&quot; panel is deeply resonant. It is very beautifully painted, there is a wonderful balance between image, color and surface, and it magically captures some of the sadness and mystery of time itself.    The Johns exhibition is coordinated with the 30th anniversary of the Castelli gallery, which has been setting trends and determining a good deal of contemporary taste for about as long as most people can remember. The gallery's anniversary is also being celebrated by a group show at 142 Greene St. (also until March 7), which brings together the works of 15 artists who were associated with the gallery during its first 15 years. One of the most striking things about this show, which includes major works by Mr. Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and the late Andy Warhol, is how profound and varied Marcel Duchamp's influence was on all of them.    One thinks of this particularly because this is the centenary of Duchamp's birth. And although his influence increases constantly with time, no major museum show will mark this anniversary. A very good exhibition of Duchamp's work, &quot;Remembering Marcel,&quot; was recently seen at the Luhring, Augustine andamp; Hodes Gallery, but it was up for only a month and included only a few of Duchamp's major works.    Duchamp's spirit also could be felt, in curious and absorbing combination with primitivism at Elaine Reichek's recent exhibition, &quot;Transfigurations,&quot; at the Carlo Lamagna Gallery. Ms. Reichek started with turn-of-the-century photographs of Tierra del Fuego Indians dressed in ceremonial garb, which she blew up to life size and placed next to full-scale knitted versions of the Indians' costumes. These have the uncanny effect of making the figures in the photographs seem almost as if they have come back to life; and conversely, of making the knitted costumes seem themselves to be nearly alive. </TEXT></DOC>
