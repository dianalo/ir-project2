But WisconsinState Rep. Polly Williams says she's surprised at thecontroversy stirred up by her experimental plan to let 1,000low-income Milwaukee children use vouchers to attend aprivate school of their choice. &quot;You'd think I dropped a bombnear the teachers' unions,&quot; she chuckles. &quot;Well, maybe thatwouldn't be so bad.&quot;   The teachers' unions have joined with officials of theNAACP in a lawsuit challenging the Williams voucher plan.They contend that the plan, under which students selected bylottery are given up to $2,500 in tuition to attend a privatenonsectarian school, is unconstitutional. The crux of theirlawsuit is that the private schools involved &quot;are designed tooperate as a type of surrogate Milwaukee public school butwithout any state control over the type or quality ofinstruction in exchange for those public funds.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Lawyers for the unions' lawsuit also have written uscontending that our support for the Williams plan is at oddswith Brookings Institution scholar John Chubb's choice plan,which he described on this page last week. Mr. Chubb wouldconvert education money into universal public &quot;scholarships&quot;and let parents choose their own schools so long as they meetminimum standards of safety, nondiscrimination and the like.   We called up Mr. Chubb and asked if he agreed that theWilliams voucher plan lacked sufficient taxpayeraccountability. &quot;That's a laughable position,&quot; he told us.&quot;Milwaukee officials have been holding their public schools`accountable' for years with disastrous results. It's quitecomical to say that private schools whose diplomas arerecognized by state universities can't be held accountable bythe parents who send their kids there.&quot;   If anything, it is the Milwaukee public schoolteachers whoare unaccountable to taxpayers. Even Milwaukee NAACP directorFelmers Chaney, a party in the lawsuit against the plan, hasraised this issue. Mr. Chaney opposes vouchers because, ifexpanded, they could lead to wholesale flight from theMilwaukee public schools. However, he points out that anaverage of only two public schoolteachers are fired eachyear. &quot;There's more incompetent teachers out there thanthat,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to take the union to task. And wemay have to take to the streets.&quot;   While the Milwaukee Sentinel and the Milwaukee Journalhave come out against her inner-city school reform, PollyWilliams does have some press support. Mikel Holt, editor ofthe largest black newspaper in Wisconsin, says the Williamschoice plan &quot;is the only way the public schools can be forcedto do a better job.&quot; His paper, the Milwaukee CommunityJournal, has reported extensively on the private schools thatwill start accepting vouchers in September.   One school, the Harambee Community School, has been ownedby black parents since its founding in 1970. Some 98% of itsstudents graduate from high school and 89% go on to college.Another, Urban Day School, uses donations to charge only $950a year and cuts the tuition further if parents volunteer 20hours of work. All of the half-dozen schools involved plan toexpand with the voucher students.   Despite all this, opponents are trying to paint Mrs.Williams as a tool of white private schools that want tohijack money destined for the needy public schools; thenearby Milwaukee Journal editorial cartoon is an example.This attitude is at first glance puzzling. The $2,500 maximumvalue of the voucher is less than half the cost of educatinga child in Milwaukee public schools. The schools shouldn'tlose any money overall for a child who transfers to a privateschool. But Mr. Chubb points out that those transfers wouldso expose the poor job the public schools are doing thattheir entire budgets would be called into question. That isthe real threat that Mrs. Williams poses to the establishmentand its status quo.   Of her mostly liberal opponents, Mrs. Williams says: &quot;Itwould be different if they worried more about their 42%drop-out rate than they did about busing African-Americankids across town like pawns.&quot; She says, &quot;My constituents wanta quality education and if public schools can provide itthat's fine. They just need some competition to get themmotivated.&quot;   Mrs. Williams did pick up one political supporter lastFriday in Milwaukee. President George Bush was in town onbehalf of Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a Williams ally.Mr. Bush called the Williams choice plan &quot;one of the mostinteresting experiments in education reform. I think we allwill see that when schools compete to attract students, thatcan't help but raise the overall level of education.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
