With the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf looming,business and leisure travel to the Middle East has become&quot;infinitesimal,&quot; claims one travel agent. Others reportsecurity concerns are prompting fliers to rethink Europeantrips. And a growing number of travelers, fearing terroristattacks, apparently are steering clear of U.S. carriers onoverseas flights.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's affected so many places, like Greece, that didn'thave a particularly good reputation {for security} to beginwith,&quot; says Beth Pazienza, co-owner of Uniglobe Full ServiceTravel Inc., a Washington travel agency.   Excursions to the Middle East dropped sharply almostimmediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, buttravelers' fears have intensified as Iraq has shown littlepromise of meeting the U.S. demand that it withdraw itstroops from Kuwait by next Tuesday or be ejected by force.   Fliers who do venture into the Middle East in the next fewweeks could find it difficult just securing a flight thereand back. Several carriers -- including Swissair,Scandinavian Airlines System, Alitalia, Cathay PacificAirlines, and Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways --have announced plans to suspend flights into certain citiesin the Gulf region. The carriers cite the rising cost ofinsurance premiums, which have increased twentyfold becauseof the additional security risks.   Still, some flights will remain available. &quot;If you want togo to Jordan tomorrow, you can get there, even though itmight not be on Swissair,&quot; says Robert Levaro, vice presidentfor multinational clients at American Express Co.   An Air Transport Association spokesman says travelers inthe region will have to depend largely on airlines fromcountries such as Iran, Israel and Egypt, whose carrierscould be targets.   Advance bookings for European travel, meanwhile, havedropped 25% to 50% in recent weeks, says Roger Ballou,president of American Express's Travel Related ServicesGroup. He cites security concerns, as well as the economicslowdown and higher fares. Bookings to Middle East countrieshave been limited to &quot;purely essential business flights,&quot; Mr.Ballou notes, while leisure travel in the region is &quot;almostnonexistent.&quot;   School groups were among the first to curtail sharplyMiddle East and European travel. Uniglobe says its businesswith high school groups has been halved. &quot;The schools don'twant the liability,&quot; says Doris Davidoff, vice president ofBelair Travel in Bowie, Md.   When Uniglobe booked a Washington-area high school groupon a trip to Russia recently, the school opted for a tourpackage on British Airways, rather than on Pan Am. Eventhough Pan Am's tickets were $500 cheaper, parents voicedconcern about the security of U.S. carriers.   Business, church and professional groups have expressedsimilar fears. The American Society of Newspaper Editorsrecently canceled a trip to the Middle East, planned forMarch, according to Evelyn Koe, owner of Globe Travel Servicein Washington. A spokeswoman for the editors' group confirmsthat the fact-finding tour was canceled when only ninemembers signed up for it. She says the trip would have beencanceled automatically if hostilities broke out in the area.   Travel Escape, another large Washington travel agency,says it didn't book a single winter cruise down the Nile,normally a popular trip this time of year, and it didn't sendanyone to the Holy Land for the Christmas holidays.   Some businesses have made travel to the Middle Eastofficially off limits. FMC Corp., a diversified machinery,chemical and defense concern in Chicago, is keeping employeesout of 15 Middle East countries and Greece, Turkey andPakistan, &quot;at least until after Jan. 15, when we see what'sgoing on,&quot; a spokeswoman says. The company says &quot;to somedegree&quot; it has encouraged its employees to stay off U.S.carriers when traveling abroad.   American Express, meanwhile, says it's beefing up securityat its travel-service offices throughout Europe for bothclients and employees as the prospect of war grows closer.&quot;We're extremely visible because of the word American in ourname,&quot; says Mr. Levaro, the American Express vice president.   There's a bright side, though, for those travelers whoventure to the Middle East in the near future: sharplydiscounted tour packages. Even El Al Israel Airlines, whichhas shunned discounting in the past, is offering packagetours at about a third of last year's price, to stir upbusiness.   However, travel agents say the price of tickets and tourpackages to Europe probably will remain high -- even thoughtravel is expected to drop off in the event of war -- becauseof recent fare increases and the weakness of the dollar.   ---   Laurie McGinley contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
