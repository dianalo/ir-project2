The FDA said in today's Federal Register that no manufacturer hasbeen able to show that such a product works.   The ban applies to products available without a prescription thatare used externally. These products are usually sold by mail orthrough barbers or beauticians.   The ban will become effective in six months, the FDA said.   The FDA also said there is no evidence that vitamins, foodsupplements or other products taken orally retard baldness or growhair. The agency said it will remove these products from the marketon a case-by-case basis if their distributors continue to make suchclaims.   The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growthon the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percentsolution of minoxidil, which is applied externally. The drug ismanufactured by The Upjohn Co. and sold under the name Rogaine.   The FDA's ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panelthat evaluated a number of ingredients, including lanolin, oliveoil, wheat germ oil and vitamins. The panel found none of theseprevented baldness or promoted hair growth.   The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of anynon-prescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair willhave to provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effectivebefore it can be put on the market.</TEXT></DOC>
