Theamendment contains actions that are expected to improve the effectivenessof several of the existing FMP measures in relation to two major factors:(1) The promotion of regulatory compliance, and (2) the long-term achievementof management objectives. This amendment also adopts a management measurethat had previously been implemented in February 1988 (53 FR 5773, February26, 1988) as an emergency action. Amendment 2 contains nine specific changes and additions to the managementsystem. These are as follows: 1. An increase in the minimum fish size (total length, TL) for yellowtailflounder from 12 inches to 13 inches and for American plaice (dab) from12 inches to 14 inches. 2. An indefinite postponement of the scheduled increase in regulated mesh(to 6 inches) in the Georges Bank portion of the Regulated Mesh Area. Alternatively,vessels operating in the Regulated Mesh Area will only be permitted touse nets with mesh no smaller than the regulated size throughout the net,effective January 1, 1990. 3. A modification to the language that allows nets of smaller than theregulated mesh aboard but not in use in the Regulated Mesh Area, by removingfrom andSection;651.20(f) paragraphs (3) and (4) and replacing them with``nets which are secured in a manner approved by the Regional Director''.4. Adopt regulatory language to facilitate non-reissuance of Exempted FisheryProgram permits when participants have not complied with reporting requirements.5. Establish a trip bycatch limit of 25 percent regulated species for vesselsoperating in the Exempted Fishery Program. 6. A prohibition on trawl vessels from entering Closed Area II during theperiod of seasonal closure. 7. The establishment of a minimum size of 9 inches (TL) for redfish. 8. Minimum fish sizes shall apply to both commercial and recreational fishermen.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Species</H1><H1>Recreational minimum size (inches)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic cod <D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Haddock <D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pollock <D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Witch flounder (gray sole) <D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Yellowtail flounder <D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">American plaice (dab) <D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Winter flounder (blackback) <D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Redfish <D>9</D></ITAG></ITAG>9. A Regulated Mesh area will be implemented for the months of Decemberthrough March in an area designated as Nantucket Shoals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses</ITAG>Written comments were submitted by the U.S. Coast Guard, Department ofthe Interior, Portland Fish Exchange, New England Fishery Management Counciland one individual. Several commenters supported approval of the Amendment.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Portland Fish Exchange objected to the 25 percentbycatch by weight of regulated species allowed per trip in the ExemptedFisheries Program when shrimp is declared as the target species. They askedthat shrimp landing slips be used rather than the actual amount on boardthe vessel upon landing to allow for the practice of holding over the regulatedspecies for sale later. They asked for clarification of the measure andhow it would be enforced.<T3>Response: </T3>The measure was developed to respond to concerns thatdirected effort on regulated groundfish while in the exempted fisheriesprogram would result in discard mortality of juvenile fish, and that thebycatch amount over the entire period of participation in the program wasbeing used as an allocation rather than as true bycatch. Enforcement washampered by the inability to enforce the bycatch provision at docksidewhere it applied to the entire time period. It was determined that a 25percent bycatch of regulated species on a trip basis was necessary to protectjuvenile regulated species and to insure attainment of Council intent.The determination of 25 percent was based on actual landing practices andwas found to have a minimal impact. Exceptions to the measure could provideloopholes which would undermine effective enforcement and jeopardize thejuvenile regulated species. The measure is implemented as proposed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the increased minimum sizeswithout a corresponding increase in mesh size which will result in discards.The commenter also requested a minimum mesh size of 3 inches for whiting.<T3>Response: </T3>The minimum fish sizes specified agree more closelywith the target retention levels of the other regulated species for a 5\1/2\inch mesh net. The measures contained in the amendment are intended toinsure the effective mesh in use is 5\1/2\ inches. A minimum mesh sizein the Exempted Fishery Program has not been addressed in this amendment.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Council commented that the preamble should note theneed for early implementation of the regulated mesh area on Nantucket Shoalsto protect large concentrations of juvenile Atlantic cod.<T3>Response: </T3>Due to the large concentrations of juvenile cod presentlyoccurring in the Nantucket Shoals area and the high mortality that willresult from their discard, the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere,NOAA, (Under Secretary) has determined that it is in the best interestof the resource and the public to waive the Administrative Procedure Actdelayed effectiveness period for this part of the Amendment.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Council commented that the proposed rule failed tospecify the implementation date of January 1, 1990 for the measure requiringthe minimum mesh size throughout the net.<T3>Response: </T3>The implementation date was stated in the preamble ofthe proposed rule and has been added as andSection; 651.20(b)(1)(ii) of thefinal rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>The Council made several comments of a minor technicalor editorial nature.<T3>Response: </T3>These comments are addressed in the body of the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) determined thatthis Amendment is necessary for the conservation and management of theNortheast multispecies fishery and that it is consistent with the MagnusonFishery Conservation and Management Act and other applicable law.The Council prepared an EA for the Amendment and concluded that there willbe no significant impact on the environment as a result of this rule. Youmay obtain a copy of the assessment from the Council at the address listedabove (see ADDRESSES). The Under Secretary determined that this rule is not a ``major rule'' requiringa regulatory impact analysis under E.O. 12291.The Under Secretary also finds that, due to the possibility of high mortalityof juvenile Atlantic cod in the Nantucket Shoals area and the high mortalitythat will result from their discards, there is good cause to make the measureestablishing a seasonal regulated mesh area for this area immediately effectiveunder section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a regulatoryflexibility analysis was not prepared.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the approved coastalzone management programs of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, RhodeIsland, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,Virginia, and North Carolina.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes to the Proposed Rule</ITAG>1.
