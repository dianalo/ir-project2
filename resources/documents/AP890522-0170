Ramsay said Mann and all other foreign hostages held in Lebanonshould be freed unconditionally. Besides Mann, 17 others aremissing _ nine Americans, three other Britons, two West Germans, anIrishman, an Italian and a Belgian.

Pope John Paul II meanwhile appealed in a letter to 16 heads ofstate and the U.N. secretary-general for steps ``to prevent thedestruction that threatens Lebanon,'' the Vatican said Monday.
