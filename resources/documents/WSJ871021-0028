The reversal of the conditions of a year earlier caused major integrated oil companies to have flat operating profits in the third quarter, analysts said.    One conspicuous exception was Chicago-based Amoco Corp., the first big oil company to report third-quarter earnings. Amoco's relatively large exploration and production operations helped lead it to report net income of $412 million, or $1.60 a share, compared with net of $13 million, or five cents a share, which had included a one-time charge of $162 million. Revenue rose to $5.72 billion from $4.48 billion a year earlier.    For most companies, higher production earnings washed out sharp declines in refining and marketing results, analysts said. That represents a marked reversal of the 1986 third quarter, in which refining and marketing profits rose as much as 200% while low oil prices hurt production profits.    While the earnings picture was mixed among big oil companies, analysts said the robustness of their exploration-and-production operations had a decidedly favorable effect on another segment of the industry: the long-beleaguered oil-service companies. Although drilling costs remain low -- benefiting oil company earnings -- the 35% increase in drilling activity caused by stable oil prices at long last put some oil-service concerns in the black, and sharply reduced operating losses for others.    Yesterday, for instance, Schlumberger Ltd., based in New York, squeaked into the black for the third quarter with net of $1.7 million, or less than one cent a share, compared with a net loss of $41.9 million a year earlier. Third-quarter profit from continuing operations totaled $151.6 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with a loss of $58.7 million a year earlier. In the 1987 quarter, the company had a loss from discontinued operations of $220 million related to the divestiture of its Fairchild Semiconductor business and gains totaling $139.1 million.    Revenue rose 10% to $1.22 billion from $1.11 billion a year earlier.    The oil-service recovery is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, but with an important caveat: the massacre in the stock market. &quot;A lot of these companies needed equity, and their balance sheets are overburdened with debt,&quot; says James D. Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;They were hoping for continued improvement in the equity market becaue they were looking for further money from the public.&quot;    But among oil companies and their service contractors alike, the most vital influence on earnings is the price of oil -- and it has been up and stayed there. The price for Brent crude oil, an industry bellwether, averaged $18.70 a barrel last quarter, up significantly from $12.45 a barrel last year. This week, several refiners have increased the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, by 50 cents a barrel to $19.    The recovering oil price is a big plus for companies more heavily involved in production than in refining and marketing, which besides Amoco include Atlantic Richfield Corp. and Unocal Corp. Arco, for instance, should report third-quarter profit of $1.50 a share, nearly triple the 56 cents of a year earlier, while Unocal's earnings should about double from a year earlier to 40 cents a share from 19 cents, according to Salomon Brothers.    On the other hand, companies with more evenly balanced operations -- which include most of the biggest oil companies -- won't fare so well. Chevron Corp., for instance, could post third-quarter operating profit of $120 million in its exploration and production operations, compared with a loss a year earlier, said George Friesen, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. But the highly competitive retail market for gasoline probably resulted in sharply lower refining and marketing profit, he said.    Pressure on these so-called downstream operations will restrain Exxon's net to about 80 cents a share, compared with 73 cents a year earlier, according to Salomon Brothers. Lingering excess refining capacity and increasingly fierce marketing programs account for much of the pricing pressure faced by refining operations.    Third-quarter earnings would have been even worse for several major oil companies except for strong demand for petrochemicals during the quarter, analysts said. That will give a boost to Exxon, Mobil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- as it did to Amoco. However, for oil companies with small chemical operations, such as Texaco Inc., the rewards won't be so great.    The combination of higher crude costs and more competitive product prices will last through the year, which could result in lower full-year earnings for such major integrated oil companies as Exxon, Mobil and Chevron, said Barry Good, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    By the same token, companies with smaller downstream operations could have sharp full-year earnings gains. Arco's earnings for all of 1987 will climb to $6.40 a share from $5.29 in 1986, predicts Mr. Good, while Unocal full-year earnings will jump to $2.20 a share from 57 cents, he figures.    In addition to Schlumberger, some of the other larger oil-service companies, particularly those that provide manufactured goods, had sizable jumps in operating profit, said Earl Stolz, analyst at Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc. Those companies include Halliburton Co. and Dresser Industries Inc. Mr. Stolz said Baker-Hughes Inc. sharply cut its loss.    Companies heavily involved in offshore drilling, such as Rowan Cos. and Ocean Drilling andamp; Exploration Co., also had narrower operating losses, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
