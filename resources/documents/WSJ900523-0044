The alliance will include Sierra Ventures, the venturecapital firm, the Institute of Protein Research, a Sovietbiotechnology research institute near Moscow, and closelyheld RiboGene Inc., a California biotech company. SierraVentures called the arrangement &quot;the first Soviet-Americanbiotech start-up.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The aim is to develop a technique for producing proteinswithout using living cells. Current techniques involveinserting genes into bacterial or mammalian cells.Identifying single proteins from hundreds or thousands ofother proteins in such cells can be tedious andtime-consuming.   Sierra Ventures said the Soviet institute is swappingtechnology for a 15% stake in RiboGene and is also obtaininga 49% stake in a related joint venture. Sierra Ventures saidit plans to invest as much as $2 million in RiboGene and thejoint firm.   The venture arises out of separate research by scientistsat RiboGene and at the Soviet institute. The Soviet researchwas somewhat more advanced than that of the U.S. firm. &quot;Theyhad also been skillful in patenting their discoveriesworld-wide,&quot; said Petri Vainio, a Sierra Ventures principal.</TEXT></DOC>
