The reason: a sharp increase in the number of residents moving out. In the early 1980s, a healthy influx of newcomers, plus the highest natural population increase of any state (about six babies are born in Alaska for every person that dies), kept population moving up briskly. Between 1980 and 1986, Alaska's population rose 32%, by far the fastest rate of increase of any state.    But as the state's oil-based economy softened, the traditional migration pattern reversed. Gregory Williams, Alaska's state demographer, estimates that in the 12 months ended in July 1987, up to 15,000 more people left Alaska than moved into the state. That was more than enough to offset the natural population increase of about 10,000 for the same period.    With Alaska's unemployment rate close to 10%, a lot of out-migrants have headed for California and the Pacific Northwest, where the job market is healthier. There is a plus side to this outflow: Sluicing out excess workers should bring the local labor supply into better balance and help stanch the state's population loss. &quot;We're seeing signs that this (population drain) has begun to bottom out,&quot; says Mr. Williams.    Ten states either lost population or had no population gain in the 12 months ended in July 1986, the most recent estimates published by the Census Bureau. They are: Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming.    ---   PHILLY MEETS THE JOB SQUEEZE: First Pennsylvania Bank's quarterly survey of executives in Philadelphia-area companies picks up some of the same labor shortage complaints that New England executives have been making the past couple of years.    Nearly 70% of the metro Philadelphia companies questioned said they planned to add employees next year, from managers to production workers, and all but a few said finding these workers would be tough. Higher pay doesn't seem to help much. The companies are already paying an average $6.58 an hour for entry-level workers. Only 11% said they had anyone on the payroll making the $3.35 an hour minimum wage.    Despite the labor crunch, only 7% of the companies said they'd consider moving operations to an area with more abundant labor.    ---   LITTLE PHNOM PENH: Long Beach, Calif., is now reputed to have the largest concentration of ethnic Cambodians outside Southeast Asia. No one has yet done a full-fledged head count, but California's education department says there are 3,325 &quot;English impaired&quot; students in Long Beach schools whose first language is Khmer (the Cambodian national language), double the number of the next-highest school district.    Add to this figure Cambodian students fluent in English, factor in parents, toddlers and in-laws at home, plus other adults, and the Cambodian population in Long Beach could fall in the 25,000 to 40,000 range.    ---   NORTH DAKOTANS TRADITIONALLY VOTE in large numbers, but in the November 1986 congressional elections, they beat every state in both registration (an amazing 95% of the voting age population) and turnout at the polls (73%). A fiercely contested U.S. Senate race, in which Democrat Kent Conrad nosed out Republican incumbent Mark Andrews, helped fire the voters enthusiasm.    Idaho, Montana, Oregon and South Dakota all had turnouts of more than 60% of the voting-age populace in 1986, according to a new voting behavior analysis from the Census Bureau. The worst performer: Kentucky, where only one-third of potentially eligible voters cast ballots.    ---   ARIZONA PURCHASING MANAGERS see signs of prosperity mixed with looming inflation. Average delivery time on incoming shipments is now the longest since mid-1984. Inventory levels continue to grow, and new orders in August and September were unusually strong. Meanwhile, price increases in the last two months were at the fastest rate in more than three years. The indicators are from the Purchasing Management Association of Arizona's September survey.    ---   EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS to high-cost areas aren't going down well, says relocation consultant Runzheimer International, of Rochester, Wis. Three-fourths of 143 corporate relocation administrators questioned said employees reassigned to the New York metropolitan area either resisted the move or refused to go. Other areas where Runzheimer says above-average cost-of-living is a significant barrier to relocation: Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco.    ---   BRIEFS: Ornamental plants and flowers passed citrus products last year as Florida's No. 1 cash crop, says the University of Florida. . . .
