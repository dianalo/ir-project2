Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler told Reuter that the request, made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was relayed to the Swiss government Monday night.    F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., based in Basel, Switzerland, bid $72 a share, or a total of $4.2 billion, for Sterling. Government sources in Washington said Monday that the SEC was investigating the possibility of insider trading after Sterling's stock price rose $1.75 to $56.875 just before the bid was announced Jan. 4. Sterling filed suit Monday alleging that two finance companies owned by Hoffmann-La Roche had traded illegally in Sterling stock and options.    In Washington, a Sterling spokesman said the U.S. request for assistance from the Swiss &quot;is an indication that our complaint has merit.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sterling shares closed at $72.875, down 87.5 cents.    A Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman said that the allegations were under investigation and that the SEC request for legal assistance had been expected. He declined to comment further.    Legal sources said the SEC sought records from three banks in Basel, but Mr. Kistler declined to give further information. &quot;We sent the request immediately to the Swiss Bankers' Association,&quot; he said.    Mr. Kistler said the SEC's request was made under Convention 16 of the Bankers' Association. The measure was adopted under pressure from the U.S. to allow examination of bank records in cases of alleged violations of U.S. securities law.    The convention allows for an independent commission to review the request and the related bank records to see whether the allegations are substantiated.    Anyone opening a bank account in Switzerland is asked to agree to let bank records be inspected under the convention. Banks are supposed to refuse to conduct transactions in U.S. securities for anyone who hasn't signed the waiver.    Jean-Paul Chapuis, managing director of the Bankers' Association, said he couldn't comment on the case immediately.    The American Stock Exchange is also reviewing trading in Sterling stock options. The review was automatically triggered by market surveillance computers, which detected unusually high volume -- 50 to 100 times the normal level -- just before the tender offer was announced.    In New York, a spokesman for the American Stock Exchange said the exchange &quot;automatically reviews any trades that are unusual, and the Sterling Drug trades fell in that category.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
