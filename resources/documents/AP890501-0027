The weapons originally were intended to provide a nucleardeterrent against attacks on surface ships by Soviet warships andsubmarines. But Navy strategists now believe they can protect U.S.ships by other means.   So, by 1991 the Navy will retire the ASROC nuclear depth charge,the SUBROC missile and the Terrier missile, a total of 1,100warheads, according to Navy officers and documents released underthe Freedom of Information Act.   The decision to discard the weapons unilaterally was containedin documents obtained by an independent analyst, William Arkin, andfirst reported in Sunday editions of The New York Times. It wasconfirmed Sunday by Navy officers who spoke on condition they notbe further identified.   It was not clear why the Bush administration chose to take thestep without public announcement and apparently without seeking toinclude the weapons in negotiations with the Soviet Union.   The decision was prompted by the realization that the UnitedStates has more aircraft carriers and large surface vessels thanthe Soviet Union, and that such ships are vulnerable to nuclearattack, said Navy officers.   ``There is a recognition that if there is a nuclear war at sea,we have got more to lose than the Russians,'' the Times quoted ViceAdmiral Henry C. Mustin, who retired last year after serving asdeputy chief of Naval Operations.   ``The concept of a nuclear war at sea is a concept whose time aspassed. It is in the interest of the country to persuade that thetime has passed,'' Mustin said in the published report.   Arkin said another reason for the decision appears to be a shiftin emphasis by the Navy from short-range weapons to nuclear-tippedTomahawk cruise missiles. The Tomahawk can fly below enemy radarand strike targets, such as bomber airfields on the Sovietmainland, at ranges up to 1,300 miles.   The Soviet Union has been insisting that the United States agreeto limit or ban submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, butunder the Reagan administration the Navy balked. The issue is beingconsidered as part of a strategic review being conducted by theBush Administration, to be completed by May 10.   The decision to retire the short-range nuclear weapons will notaffect strategic ballistic missiles stationed aboard Navy nuclearsubmarines that form a key part of the U.S. nuclear triad, land,air and sea-based weapons intended to deter a large-scale attack,said Navy officers.   The weapons that are being retired constitute part of theAmerican nuclear arsenal that has received little public attentionin the media or on Capitol Hill, compared to the extensivediscussions that have occurred on the cruise and ballistic systems.   The ASROC nuclear depth charge, carried aboard U.S. destroyers,cruisers and frigates involved in anti-submarine warfare, has arange of up 6.2 miles.   The SUBROC missile is carried by attack submarines, and isdesigned to fly at supersonic speeds, then drop a nuclear chargeagainst enemy submarines.   The Terrier anti-aircraft missile, which entered service in1962, is fired from surface warships and has a range of up to 21.7miles, according to Janes Fighting Ships, an independentlypublished military handbook.   Arkin said in a telephone interview that the strategy behind thedecision was outlined in the Theater Nuclear Warfare UtilitiesStudy, conducted in January 1988, and supplied to him withsignificant portions blacked out.   As a result of the decision, said Arkin, ``scores'' of Navydestroyers, frigates and attack submarines that had beennuclear-armed will no longer carry nuclear weapons.   It was not clear whether or how much money the DefenseDepartment will save by retiring the short-range weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
