The new futures contract, under study for several years,begins trading at 9:20 a.m. EDT tomorrow on the New YorkMercantile Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   The contract unit will be 10 billion British thermal units-- about 10 million cubic feet. Prices will be in dollars permillion BTUs, or about 1,000 cubic feet. The delivery pointwill be Louisiana's Henry Hub gas interchange operated byTexaco Inc.'s Sabine Pipe Line subsidiary. Dedicationceremonies tomorrow at the interchange near Erath, La., willcoincide with the opening of trading.   The New York Merc already offers futures trading in crudeoil, heating oil, gasoline, propane and residual fuel. But onthe eve of the gas futures' debut, there still are some whoobject to it. These include some smaller producers worriedabout the impact on pricing of actions by speculators andother outsiders not familiar with the industry's risks.   But similar objections were voiced before the start oftrading in petroleum futures, which have since reshaped worldoil markets. Proponents of the new fuel contract predict asimilar restructuring of the ways natural gas is bought andsold.   &quot;It will have a snowball effect on the business,&quot; saysJohn E. Olson, a leading proponent of gas futures trading.   Mr. Olson, a Houston-based natural gas analyst for FirstBoston Corp., calls the contract an idea whose time isoverdue. &quot;This will provide a transparent pricing mechanismfor gas and will allow arbitrage against residual fuel,&quot; hesaid.   Gas's main competitor, residual fuel, has drawn littleinterest on the Nymex. But total trading in the crude oilcontract, which has made West Texas Intermediate something ofa household term in much of the country, routinely exceedsthe volume of all the oil the world actually produces.   Few are willing to make predictions of trading volume inthe untried gas futures market. Some oil futures traderssuggest it could eventually match that of crude oil on a BTUor dollar basis. They see a big potential for gas becausearound 80% of the 18.8 trillion cubic feet used last year inthe U.S. was sold on the spot market or through short-termcontracts, leaving only 20% for long-term contracts.   &quot;The gas market is huge, there is increased emphasis ongas because of the Clean Air Act and environmental concerns,and the number of players is larger than for oil,&quot; says LanceSchneier, chairman of Access Energy Corp., a leading gasmarketer.   Gas prices -- currently around $1.50 per 1,000 cubic feetat the well-head in Texas -- have been relatively flat forthe past three years even as oil prices bounced back fromtheir 1986 collapse. But demand for gas has been growing, andthe renewed interest in the clean-burning fuel already mayhave eliminated the surplus that has plagued the industry forseveral years.   Still, there are tests for gas to pass before its positionin futures markets can be assured. Not the least is theindustry's &quot;ability to fulfill a contract with the physicaldelivery of the commodity at a specified location at aspecified price&quot; at all times, says Nicholas Bush, presidentof the Natural Gas Supply Association.   Contracts will be traded for 12 consecutive months, anddelivery is to be made over the course of the delivery month.But some others also question sellers' abilities to deliverduring periods such as last December's cold wave, whenpipelines were operating at maximum.   If oil futures are any guide, actual deliveries of gas arelikely to be minimal. A Nymex spokeswoman says less than 1%of the oil traded is actually delivered. Nevertheless, suchoperational considerations will remain a concern until gas'sfutures system is thoroughly tested.   &quot;Gas is not like soybeans or corn,&quot; says Alan Anderson,president of Energy Planning Inc., a gas market researchfirm. &quot;We are waiting to see how well it will workphysically.&quot;   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                                                 Copper                                                                                                          The copper market usually slows down in April as demandtapers off, but it should start this month roaring.   On Friday, the May futures contract rose to a freshlife-of-contract high of $1.227 a pound before easingslightly to end at $1.224, up 4.50 cents.   Driving prices higher were a wildcat walkout by workers atthe Highland Valley copper mine in British Columbia, whichwas out for 3 1/2 months last year in a similar dispute overusing outside workers, and a second mine strike in Peru.Highland Valley annually produces 160,000 tons ofconcentrates containing about 30% copper.   An injunction was expected to end the Highland Valleywalkout, but workers at the Tintaya mine in Peru went out onan indefinite strike over wages Friday, analysts said.   Tintaya produces just over 11% of Peru's copper. SouthernPeru Copper Corp., whose miners and smelter workers have beenon strike since March 12, produces about 64% of thatcountry's copper, meaning slightly more than 75% of Peru'scopper capacity is currently shut down. Peru is the world'ssixth largest copper producer.   There were reports that workers at the Ok Tedi mine inPapua New Guinea had gone out on strike, but they couldn't beconfirmed, analysts said. The mine produces 230,000 tons ofconcentrates. Papua New Guinea is also the site of theBougainville copper mine, with a capacity of about 600,000tons of concentrates annually, which has been idled sincelast May because of attacks by native landowners.   Supplies may shrink even further. London Metal Exchangecopper inventory data today are expected to show a drop ofseveral thousand tons.   Copper's resurgence has nothing to do with the worldeconomy but is being caused by factors within the industry,one analyst said.   &quot;That means if the current problems are solved and demandslumps because of slower economic conditions, prices couldstill turn lower later in the year, in line with mostpredictions,&quot; he said.                                                                                                                                 Cotton                                                                                                          While greater export sales and shipments of cotton buoyedprices late last week, a plantings report released Friday maytemper the bullish trend.   The May contract Friday ended with a gain of 0.58 cent to72.70 cents a pound.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said after tradingended Friday that about 12.4 million acres will be plantedwith cotton in the U.S. for harvest in the season beginningAug. 1, up from 10.6 million in the current season.   Based on average yields, this acreage could produce 14.5million to 15.7 million bales of cotton, compared with 12.2million bales this season.   However, an analyst said the report might not affectfutures much, because the increase had been expected. He alsosaid contracts for later months that would be directlyaffected by the size of the next season's acreage are alreadypriced at significant discounts to the earlier contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
