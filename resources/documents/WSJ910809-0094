But the rally ran into stiff resistance at 1.7240 marks,the intraday high, as participants unloaded dollars to takeprofits and to establish new short, or oversold, positions,foreign exchange traders said.</LP><TEXT>   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7150 marks,up from 1.7102 marks late Wednesday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 136.25 yen, up from135.90 yen. Sterling fetched $1.7063, down from $1.7130.   The dollar tested new lows against the yen as well, butrebounded after it failed to break below 135.33 yen.   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 136.15yen, up from Tokyo's Thursday close of 135.45 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7165 marks, up from 1.7036marks at Thursday's close.   Technical charts took the spotlight away from concernsabout the differential between German and U.S. interestrates. The market already has factored in the easing of U.S.monetary policy and the potential for a tightening in Germanynext Thursday, traders said.   The charts, which use history to predict currencymovements, flashed conflicting signals and produced a choppymarket, dealers said.   Some charts, for example, told traders to buy dollars at1.7205 marks but to sell them at 1.7245 marks, said a traderat Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in New York.   The Federal Reserve executed $2 billion of customerrepurchase agreements, adding reserves to the banking systemwhen the federal funds interest rate stood at about 5 5/8%,above the perceived 5 1/2% target rate. Federal funds is therate banks charge each other for overnight loans.   The move proved confusing to some players because thecentral bank had executed more powerful system repurchaseagreements over the last two days, pushing the federal fundsrate to 5 1/2% from the previously perceived target of 53/4%.   A federal funds specialist at the New York office of aEuropean bank said the move might mean the Fed ishalf-hearted about its recent easing of monetary policy.Other traders thought the Fed intended only to fine-tune thelevel of reserves.   They said the Fed didn't appear to be backing away fromits new target interest rate. But late in the North Americanday, federal funds were trading at 5 3/4%, up from 5 5/8% atthe opening.   The dollar picked up momentum for its test of 1.7000 marksduring Asian trading. The U.S. unit shed about a pfennig inAsia, and hovered just above the 1.7000-mark level asEuropean dealings opened. It dipped to 1.6995 marks early inthe European day, a level not seen since May 29, when thedollar hit an intraday low at 1.6910 marks.   The dip gave speculators a chance to take profits onoversold dollar positions, and allowed corporations in Europeand Asia to satisfy some of their appetite for dollars atbargain prices, traders said.   There has been &quot;a lot of pent-up demand for dollars,&quot; saidMarc Chandler, a New York currency analyst at IDEA, aLondon-based analytic firm.   The dollar rally strengthened as North American traderscame on line. U.S. corporations, investment funds andinterbank speculators joined the buying spree, carrying thedollar to 1.7240 marks, its intraday high.   Traders believe the market is widely short dollars andlong marks in anticipation that German interest rates will beratcheted higher when the Bundesbank's central bank councilmeets next Thursday.   Traders expect a half to a full-percentage point boost inGermany's 6.5% discount rate, the central bank's leastexpensive form of refinancing. They also expect a half-pointrise in the 9% Lombard rate, the lending facility of lastresort.   Traders believe the dollar's downside potential is limitedto about 1.6850 marks, so few traders will want to establishlarge short positions around current levels.   Some traders said the dollar appears still to be in aminor downtrend, but it could be consolidating for a movehigher soon. But others said the dollar's failure to break1.7000 marks suggests that its downtrend from 1.8400 marks onJuly 12 might be near an end.   &quot;The word `overdone' does pop into mind,&quot; said one NewYork trader.   In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was trading at $356.75 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
