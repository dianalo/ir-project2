IBM has been hired to runKodak's data centers and System Network Architecture (SNA) networks.andM;Digital will manage the film maker's other voice and data video areanetworks.andP;  And Businessland will handle its personal computers and local areanetworks.andM;Critical NetworksandM;Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. considered turning over the operation of part of itsvoice and data networking to a team from IBM and MCI, but concluded that thenetwork was too mission critical to allow someone else to operate.andP;  AvonProducts Inc. also considered outsourcing and, while deciding not to, foundthe evaluation process to be useful for appraising the effectiveness of itsown operation.andP;  Responding to this new market opportunity among the vendorswere not only Digital, IBM and mci, but such varied companies as ATandamp;T, theBell operating companies, Electronic Data Systems Corp. Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;and Westinghouse Electric CorpandM;Integrated backbone networks carrying voice and data became the standard atmany corporations by 1989.andP;  The biggest reason, of course, was reductions inthe cost of 1.44 megabit per second T1 circuits, the greater availability of2.04Mbps E-1 lines in Europe and the introduction of fractional T I service,which made such networks affordable for more organizations.andM;Network Equipment Technologies Inc. continued its dramatic sales growth andremained dominant in the large-backbone switch market while expanding intosmaller, entry-level switches and X.25 concentrators.andM;Sophisticated RoutingandM;StrataCom Inc. introduced the industry's first frame relay interface, whichprovides sophisticated routing capabilities and lays the groundwork for suchemerging packet services as the IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).andM;ATandamp;T, with the delivery of AccuMaster Integrator, and IBM, with extensions toNetView, positioned themselves as vendors with the tools required to manageintegrated networks.andP;  And, as IBM was forming alliances to expand its networkmanagement capabilities to encompass LANs and private branch exchanges(PBXs), it concluded the sale of Rolm to Siemens AG.andP;  Under the terms of thesale, IBM is continuing to sell Rolm PBXS, but Siemens is controllingdevelopment.andM;Swift BackbonesandM;High-speed corporate networks and the overall lowering of bandwidth costsalso promoted the resurgence of videoconferencing.andP;  Compression Labs Inc. andPicture Tel Corp. together control more than 90% of the U.S.andO;videoconferencing equipment market for sales of systems under $50,000.andP;  Ascorporate networks evolve and the bandwidth of their T1-based facilities areconsumed by voice, videoconferencing and LAN connectivity, users' need foreven higher speed backbones is evident.andP;  Network Equipment Technologies andInfotron brought 45Mbps T3 multiplexers to market in response to thesegrowing requirements.andP;  The trend also prompted both ATandamp;T and Northern TelecomLtd. to announce support for the SONET multiplexing standard in their centraloffice switching equipment.andP;  Their mo,,, encouraged others to support thescheme, which is based on fiber optic transmission operating at speeds inmultiples of 30Mbps up to 1 gigabit in both long-haul and campus networking.andM;The LAN market as a whole showed signs of moderating in 1989.andP;  Despitecontinued growth in the sales of LAN operating systems and adapter boards,both leading independent LAN companies, Novell Inc. and 3Com Corp., had lowerthan anticipated sales.andP;  Although Novell's sales increased by more than 20%,many analysts expected its growth in 1989 to be higher.andP;  SynopticsCommunications Inc. was able to take advantage of an explosion in the marketfor 10Mbps Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair wiring by capturing about70% of sales and forcing others, like 3Com, to respond quickly.andM;What's HotandM;The hottest sellers were LAN/WAN bridges, routers and gateways, asorganizations struggled to connect their islands of technology.andP;  Despite mostvendors' concerns over diverting resources from their longer term developmentefforts in connection with the Open Systems Interconnection protocol,acceptance continued of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) standard as the multivendor connectivity protocol set.andP;  Among thoseenhancing their TCP/IP support was IBM with software for its  os/2 PCoperating system, thereby offering a TCP/IP implementation for each of itsmajor operating systems.andM;Significant activity also occurred among the value-added network providersduring 1989.andP;  British Telecommunications PLC purchased McDonnell DouglasCorp.'s Network System Group, including Tymnet, and announced plans to mergeTymnet and Dialcom services.andP;  ATandamp;T moved into the value-added market in theUnited Kingdom by acquiring Istel, a networking spinoff of the Rover Group.andO;mci strengthened it; position both internationally and in data communicationsby acquiring Computer Sciences Corp.'s remaining 25% holding in Infonet, theother equity partners in Infonet being the Post, Telephone and Telegraphservices  (PTTS) from Europe and Asia.andP;  All of the value-added networkproviders announced X.400-based electronic mail services and the intention ofsupporting EDIFACT, the international standard for exchanging EDI messages.andM;David M.
