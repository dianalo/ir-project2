Now, the elusive terrorist suspects are sitting in EastGerman jails awaiting extradition to West Germany for trial.Their story adds a footnote to the Cold War annals of adivided Germany.</LP><TEXT>   Millions of West German marks and untold hours were spenttrying to find the two women, among the 20 or so members ofthe Red Army Faction terror group who have been at the top ofWest Germany's most-wanted lists since the 1970s.   West German police last arrested a top RAF member in 1982;the other suspects vanished. But the killing of publicofficials and industry leaders kept up through the 1980s. Themost recent was the murder in November of Deutsche Bank AGChairman Alfred Herrhausen, whose car was blown up by aroadside bomb.   Police were embarrassed for years by their inability totrack down prime suspects. Now they have some reason to knowwhy: At least some disappeared into East Germany with thecooperation of the East German Ministry for State Security,or Stasi. East German authorities now say they suspect Stasigranted haven -- and possibly new identities -- to fugitiveWest German terrorists.   The disclosures triggered outrage in Bonn. West Germany'sopposition Social Democratic Party spoke bitterly of&quot;veritable terror nests&quot; in East Germany and demanded aparliamentary investigation.   Many West German authorities aren't particularlysurprised. &quot;We relayed our first indications that RAF memberscould be living in East Germany to East Berlin in 1986, butdidn't get any response,&quot; said Hartmut Jaufmann, spokesmanfor West Germany's Federal Criminal Office. &quot;Since thechanges of last year, they've become much more cooperative.&quot;   With German unification looming, East German authoritiesare throwing out the dragnet. East German Interior MinisterPeter-Michael Diestel sharply criticized the old Communistregime and pledged his full support in rooting out anyterrorists hiding in East Germany.   &quot;I also will clear up as much as possible this diabolicalconnection between the Ministry for State Security and theterror scene,&quot; Mr. Diestel declared during a visit to Bonnthis week.   Speaking yesterday at a news conference in East Berlin,Mr. Diestel said East Germany's top Communist leaders knew ofthe Stasi program for fugitive terrorists. He saidquestioning of Ms. Albrecht disclosed that RAF ringleaders in1980 urged her to flee because she had become a securityrisk. He said that on arriving in East Germany, Ms. Albrechtsaid she was told that East Germany disapproves of the RAF'smethods, but supports the gang's &quot;anti-imperialistorientation.&quot;   Ms. Albrecht's shadowy existence ended June 6, when EastGerman police, working with West German counterterrorofficials, arrested the 39-year-old in her East Berlinapartment, where she lived under a new name.   Ms. Albrecht, the daughter of a prosperous Hamburgattorney, is suspected of complicity in the 1977 murder ofDresdner Bank AG Chairman Hans-Juergen Ponto, who was a closefriend of the Albrecht family. The banker reportedly admittedMs. Albrecht and her accomplices into his home afterrecognizing Ms. Albrecht. He was shot five times, apparentlyby one of Ms. Albrecht's associates.   After assuming her new East German identity in 1980, sheapparently broke ties with the RAF, married an East Germanand gave birth to a daughter. Authorities say she wasidentified in her solid middle-class hideaway after screeningEast German immigration records. But there also isspeculation that Ms. Albrecht was identified by a formerStasi official.   The second coup came Tuesday night, when East Germanpolice arrested Ms. Viett in her apartment in the city ofMagdeburg after being tipped off by a neighbor. The46-year-old former kindergarten teacher was on themost-wanted list for a series of terror attacks, includingthe 1974 murder of a West Berlin judge and the 1981 shootingof a French policeman while escaping arrest in Paris.   Both Ms. Albrecht and Ms. Viett are believed to havebroken years ago with the RAF's bloody campaign against whatthey call the military-industrial complex. Mr. Diestel saidthat Ms. Albrecht kept in touch with the Stasi until thecollapse of the Communist regime late last year.   Other leads on terrorists are beginning to surface. ADresden newspaper reported that another RAF suspect, SilkeMaier-Witt, had lived in that East German city. Ms.Maier-Witt is wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnappingand murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer, a West German industryleader. There also are reports that Sigrid Sternebeck, soughtin connection with an attempted bazooka attack on the WestGerman Attorney General's Office in 1977, could be in EastGermany.</TEXT></DOC>
