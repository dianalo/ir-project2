But because the commissions and fees charged on different types of products vary and aren't always clearly identified, it can be difficult to calculate the actual cost of an investment. &quot;If people really understood what they were paying sometimes, they wouldn't pay it,&quot; says Jay Goldinger, a Beverly Hills, Calif., broker with Cantor, Fitzgerald andamp; Co.    Moreover, some financial advisers warn, the relatively unregulated commissions and other sales charges are often so hefty -- and differ so greatly among products -- that they can present a substantial conflict of interest for the investment professional.    Making recommendations based on compensation &quot;isn't a dubious practice occurring at only second-rate firms,&quot; says Mary Calhoun, a former broker who has written a book on how individuals can protect their investments. Commissions provide &quot;a temptation so great it represents a whole new level of investment risk.&quot;    The people who earn their living selling stocks, bonds and other investments are under heavy pressure these days to produce commission revenue because business is off sharply. Last November, the average number of transactions being processed daily by the securities industry was down 22% from September, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a New York research firm.    Commissions generated by retail brokers in 1986, the last year for which figures are available, averaged $245,843, according to the Securities Industry Association. Brokers don't keep 100% of the commissions their sales earn, however. Depending upon their seniority and productivity as well as the type of investment and their firm's policies, they may receive only 25% to 50%.    Similar percentages apply for financial planners employed by financial services companies. Most planners who run their own businesses, however, retain 100% of the commissions and fees they earn. Planners say there's nothing wrong with that -- as long as they disclose the fact to investors.    But James Edmunds Wilson, chairman of the National Association of Professional Financial Advisors, a nationwide group that eschews commissions in favor of flat fees, charges that too many planners are &quot;fancy product purveyors&quot; whose investment advice is influenced by the income they can make from it.    As for disclosure, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that all mutual fund and limited partnership prospectuses disclose commissions and that all securities firms list commissions on the investor's confirmation statement.    But those statements don't always tell the whole story. Often the seller's compensation is factored into the price of a security or simply buried in the prospectus and termed a marketing fee, markup, load or levy. For example, if a brokerage house bought an over-the-counter stock traded on the national market system at $15 a share and is selling it to other dealers at $17, the firm can sell it to the individual at $18, listing the commission, or a markup, as $1 a share.    While the SEC doesn't set ceilings on commissions, &quot;we have held, in a number of cases, that dealer markups were so high that they were fraudulent,&quot; typically in the case of over-the-counter stocks and municipal bond transactions, says Robert Colby, chief counsel for the SEC's office of market regulation.    On the investor's part, &quot;We could use a little paranoia in this area,&quot; he says.    Ideally, the commission is disclosed at the time of the transaction, says Mary McCue, spokeswoman for the SEC. But whether out of embarrassment, ignorance or misplaced courtesy, brokers and planners say clients almost never inquire about the compensation they receive from investment recommendations.    Of course, the commission is only one factor in the investment decision, says Wallace Head, director of the fee-only personal financial planning service at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. &quot;You're not trying to find the transaction that costs you the least,&quot; he says, &quot;but the one that makes you the most money.&quot;    Still, the riskiest, most complicated or least liquid investments usually offer salespeople and their firms the greatest compensation. That's because those products are the hardest to sell. Real-estate limited partnerships, for example, typically pay a commission to salespeople of 4% to 8%. But some offer more, including a variety of other management fees that are rebated to the securities firm if it is acting as a material participant in the partnership. By contrast, Treasury bills offer brokers a commission of $50 or less regardless of the size of the purchase.    What follows is a rundown of various financial products -- and the commissions investors should expect to pay for them.    STOCKS   Commissions on stock purchases hinge on the size of the order and the price of the stock. On a 100-share order, for example, the typical commission might range from $30 to $80. But compensation is out in the open for purchases of stocks traded on major exchanges, since quotes are available on these shares and most firms post their rates.    Commissions built into the price of some of the more thinly traded over-the-counter stocks and on penny stocks, however, can average more than 10% of the investment. In hundreds of these stocks, the spread between a dealer firm's selling price and the price at which it will buy shares back is so substantial -- running up to $10 for a $30 to $40 stock -- that investors who buy a stock and immediately resell it would suffer a significant loss.    The National Association of Securities Dealers sets a 5% guideline on the markups its member firms can charge investors above the price dealers pay for securities. But brokers say this limit is often exceeded, particularly in the case of thinly traded stocks, options and municipal bonds. Markups are higher on products such as municipals and over-the-counter stocks because they are stockpiled by brokerage firms, which accept the inventory risk.    In addition, at some brokerage firms, brokers retain a higher percentage of the commissions they generate on over-the-counter stock sales than on stocks traded on major exchanges.    The equity products that generate among the heftiest commissions are fully margined stock accounts. These accounts allow an investor to buy stock valued at twice as much as the amount of money deposited in the account, using money lent by the brokerage firm. Not only does twice as much stock mean twice the commissions, but some firms pay brokers a percentage of the loan interest earned on the margin debt.    In general, commissions on equity transactions are highly negotiable. Senior brokers are often able to slash as much as 50% for favored and frequent customers.    MUTUAL FUNDS   Load mutual funds typically charge investors 1% to 8% of their initial investment, all paid as commission to the broker-dealer. The NASD sets a top limit of 8.5%. The percentage declines with the size of the investment.    Commissions are generally higher for new mutual funds, as an incentive to the salesperson to help get it off the ground. And at some funds, such as the Franklin Resources Inc.'s family of funds, brokers or planners also receive a commission if investors deposit additional money into existing accounts or even if they simply opt to reinvest dividends. And some funds offer luxurious prizes or trips on top of the commission to the broker who sells the most in a given period. Although those incentives don't increase the investor's costs, they may prejudice the salesperson.    In addition, some mutual funds, called 12B-1 funds, allow fund managers to deduct a percentage -- usually ranging from 1/10% to 1% of the fund's total assets -- to cover marketing and distribution expenses annually. As of last June, 925 of the 2,161 funds tracked by Lipper Analytical, including some no-load funds, had provisions allowing them to kick back part of this money to brokers and planners -- often on top of sales commissions already paid.    LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS   Bill Turchyn, national director of direct investment programs for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., says 4% to 8% is now the normal commission range for limited partnerships. Oil and gas drilling partnerships offer slightly more to the salesperson than the standard real-estate syndication.    For master limited partnerships, which are publicly traded on stock exchanges, outright commissions are generally smaller -- 2% to 4% -- but underwriting fees can bring them up to the total of the standard limited partnership.    Partnership commissions are generally not negotiable, says Mr. Turchyn, but volume discounts are sometimes available for purchases of $50,000 or more.    BONDS   Investors can purchase Treasury bonds and bills directly from the Federal Reserve without paying any commissions. Commissions on Treasury bond sales through brokerage houses typically run $25 to $50 for a $5,000 bond, says Mr. Goldinger of Cantor Fitzgerald.    However, the markup a brokerage house charges on the sale of a $5,000 municipal bond can go up to $250, according to Robert Lamb, New York University professor of finance and co-author of a 1984 study on bond commissions.    In Treasuries, says Mr. Goldinger, there are &quot;many more players, dealers and brokers. There's more competition&quot; for the investor's money.    INSURANCE PRODUCTS   Investment-oriented insurance products such as annuities and single-premium life-insurance products typically pay the salesperson 3% to 8% of the investment. This compensation is paid by the insurance company, not by the investor, but will be recaptured by the company out of the assets over a period of years or through a surrender charge in the case of early withdrawal.    In the case of universal-life insurance products, which are hybrids of a life-insurance policy and a savings account, overall compensation could average 8.5% of the annual premiums. Standard whole-life insurance policies, which are usually not sold by brokers but can be sold by planners, pay the salesperson 50% to 100% of the first or second annual premium.    ---                    Pyramid of Temptation    Commissions a financial adviser earns on a $10,000 investment    $600-$1,000+    Limited partnership     $500-$1,000    Common stock -- &quot;spot secondary&quot;                    offering       $400-$850    Mutual funds (front- or rear-end load)            $600    New mutual fund in offering period       $400-$600    Options -- buy puts or calls       $400-$600    Annuities, life insurance policies       $300-$600    Common stock -- public offering       $100-$600    Municipal or corporate long-term bonds       $400-$500    Common stock -- fully margined       $300-$490    Unit investment trust       $200-$250    Common stock -- traded on NYSE        $50-$100    Municipal or corporate short-term bonds;                    U.S. Government bills, notes, bonds              $0    No-load mutual funds</TEXT></DOC>
