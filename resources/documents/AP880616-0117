Eban, 73, fell victim a new selection system in which for thefirst time the rank-and-file, not party bosses, chose the slate forthe elections to Israel's parliament, the Knesset.   Half the candidates elected Wednesday were political newcomers,and Labor's general secretary, Uzi Baram, called the outcome a``revolution'' and ``feast for Israel's democracy.''   ``It's clearly a disappointment,'' Eban told Israel army radio.``During the years I have accumulated valuable knowledge andexperience. I told party members I'm ready to offer this, but ifyou don't want it, I won't.''   During his 40-year political career, Eban served as deputy primeminister, foreign minister and Israel's ambassador to the UnitedStates and the United Nations.   Samuel Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said Eban'souster was a ``real tragedy, not for him, but for the country.''   ``I've never known anyone else who I thought had made a greatercontribution to his country,'' Lewis told Israel radio fromWashington.   Political analyst Yitzhak Galnoor said Eban might have retainedhis position had the party bosses formed the slate, but the newselection process showed he ``doesn't have a following in Israel.''   ``Eban is not connected to any influential groups. He's just abright guy with a terrific sense of humor. Unfortunately, thesethings are not very admired in Israeli politics,'' said Galnoor, apolitical scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.   Party members did not choose Eban in the Labor Party's rankedlist of candidates for Israel's 120-member Knesset. The number ofparliament seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote inthe elections.   Based on previous election results, Labor candidates in the top40 to 45 slots are expected to be re-elected.   Eleven slots, including the top seven reserved for partyleaders, were filled by appointment, not popular vote. Twenty-oneof the remaining 34 slots considered ``safe'' were given tonewcomers.   Four of the newcomers were Sephardic Jews from North Africannations, a group that has traditionally voted for Labor's politicalrival, the right-wing Likud bloc.   Galnoor said the selection might improve Labor's chances in theelection, but also said such gains could be offset if Labor doesn'tdeliver a clear message on how it will solve the Arab-Israeliconflict.   Polls have indicated that the Labor Party might lose theelection to Likud because many voters have moved to the right inresponse to the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   Likud leaders say Israel will never withdraw from the occupiedterritories. Labor advocates the return of some land in exchangefor peace, but opposes formation of a Palestinian state or thedismantling of Jewish settlements.</TEXT></DOC>
