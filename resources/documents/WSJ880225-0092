Falwell --- Ruling Extends Protection Of the First Amendment To Cover Satire, Parody </HL><AUTHOR> Stephen Wermiel (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PUB REL </IN><G> SUP </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protects satire and parody, even when they cause emotional distress to public figures, just as libelous statements about such persons receive special treatment under the Constitution.    Voting 8-0, the justices threw out a $200,000 verdict a jury awarded the Rev. Jerry Falwell for emotional distress caused by a 1983 parody in Hustler magazine.    In an opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the high court said a public figure or public official who sues for damages for emotional distress caused by publication of cartoons, parodies or satires must prove two things. First, the public figure must prove that the parody could be read as stating facts, rather than a point of view, and second, that it was published with &quot;actual malice,&quot; which means either with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth.    Without this First Amendment protection, the chief justice wrote, &quot;there can be little doubt that political cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damage awards without any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject.&quot;    Since 1964, the Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment protects the news media in libel cases involving allegations by public figures of false statements of fact that damaged their reputations. The decision yesterday extends the same protection to the news media in a relatively new type of complaint by public figures claiming that parodies that aren't based on fact and don't harm their reputations nevertheless inflict emotional distress.    Lawsuits for intentionally causing emotional distress have succeeded for decades in other contexts, originating with jury awards of damages for those who were insulted with abusive language by railroad and hotel personnel.    Recently, use of such lawsuits against the news media has been increasing. One reason is that before yesterday's Supreme Court decision, a public figure could file a lawsuit for emotional distress without having to satisfy the high standard of proving the media acted with reckless disregard.    The latest ruling is likely to stop the trend, according to lawyers who defend the news media against suits. &quot;This decision will broadly discourage lawsuits that try to make an end-run around the libel laws,&quot; said Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer and First Amendment expert.    Some lawyers were surprised that the decision was written by Justice Rehnquist, who has never been a defender of the media's First Amendment rights, and that the ruling so strongly endorsed freedom of the press and political satire, when many conservatives say there should be less protection for the media in libel cases. &quot;I can't think of a decision in the last 15 years that has had such a ringing affirmation of First Amendment principles,&quot; said Lee Levine, a news media lawyer in Washington.    Mr. Falwell sued for libel and emotional distress, but a federal jury rejected the former and awarded damages only for distress. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., upheld the award.    The Hustler parody was modeled on a series of advertisements for Campari that showed celebrities talking about their &quot;first time&quot; drinking the liquor. The parody described Mr. Falwell's &quot;first time&quot; as his first sexual experience, a fictitious drunken encounter with his mother.    Justice Byron White, in a brief separate statement, agreed the First Amendment bars the award to Mr. Falwell, although he didn't say why. However, he said he disagrees with the court's extension to this case of the 1964 libel ruling, because that decision is limited to situations involving alleged false statements of fact.    Justice Anthony Kennedy didn't participate in yesterday's decisions, because the cases were argued before he joined the court.    By a 6-2 vote, the high court rejected a challenge by landlords to a San Jose, Calif., rent control law. The law, apparently unique in the U.S., says that before the city grants a landlord a rent increase, it should consider &quot;hardship&quot; to the tenant. Landlords argued that the mere existence of the 1979 law, regardless of how it is applied, violates several constitutional provisions, including the prohibition on governments taking private property &quot;without just compensation.&quot;    In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the court said the law doesn't violate the Constitution by its mere existence. In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Sandra O'Connor, said the law causes an unconstitutional taking of property. </TEXT></DOC>
