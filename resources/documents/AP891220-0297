Faces Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD><DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Walter Corp.'s parent company saidWednesday it was prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection in what would be a first among large firms taken privateby buyout specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co.   Kohlberg Kravis formed Hillsborough Holdings Corp. as part ofits $2.4 billion takeover of the building materials company lastyear. A bankruptcy court filing by the company could inject freshjitters into the junk-bond market that has financed such takeovers.   Hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expectedto be made Dec. 27 if an exchange offer for $624 million worth ofthe company's bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of thecompany's bondholders.   Kohlberg Kravis has apparently failed to persuade a group ofHillsborough's senior bondholders to accept a proposed financialrestructuring of the company.   ``If the pending exchange offers are not consummated on theircurrent terms and conditions, Hillsborough and certain of itssubsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntarypetitions for reorganization under Chapter 11,'' saidHillsborough's spokesman David Townsend.   If the offer is not accepted, Hillsborough faces the prospect ofhaving to repay its notes in full, which it told bondholders at ameeting Tuesday that it could not do.   A Chapter 11 filing would blemish the record of Kohlberg Kravis,considered the dean of the leveraged buyout artists with the $25billion RJR Nabisco deal to its credit. But the Hillsborough firmhas some peculiar problems, which are not necessarily symptomaticof widespread weakness among LBOs, experts said.   ``It's not going to be that devastating,'' said James Grant,publisher of a New York interest rate newsletter and a critic ofleveraged buyouts. ``Hillsborough Holdings had problems of its ownthat had nothing to do with the takeover.''   The biggest problem, Grant said, came last summer when JimWalter was hit with a $3 billion asbestos-related lawsuit. Becauseof the class-action suit, Kohlberg Kravis has been unable to selloff Jim Walter's assets. And without the proceeds from the sales,the company cannot meet its upcoming debt payments.   Hillsborough is the third company owned by Kohlberg Kravis toencounter financial difficulties in recent months.   In August, Kohlberg Kravis confirmed that Seaman Furniture Co.,a leading furniture retailer, could not meet its debt payments andmight not be able to continue operating. The company's debtpayments were later rescheduled successfully.   SCI Television Inc., of which Kohlberg Kravis owns 45 percent,is also involved in an exchange offer that is facing resistancefrom bondholders.   But neither of those Kohlberg Kravis holdings is as large asHillsborough.</TEXT></DOC>
