Analysts say Digital's acquisition of a 5 percent stake in MipsComputer Systems Inc. marks a move to accept and implementtechnological advances occurring outside the company.   Digital announced plans Wednesday to develop computer workstations based on the California company's technology.   Work stations are expensive desktop computers that typically areused for work that requires extensive manipulation of numbers orsophisticated graphics, such as science, engineering, design andfinancial modeling.   ``This is an acceptance on DEC's part that the computer user'sdollar is being spent on work stations and small systems,'' saidBruce Watts, an analyst with Needham andamp; Co.   ``I think they feel that internally they've got enough on theirhands in terms of keeping their own product line up to date andcompetitive, and if they want to tap other segments of the marketthey have to look outside,'' he said.   Digital said it is lining up with Mips, based in Sunnyvale,Calif., to speed new work station products to the marketplace. TheMaynard-based computer giant is second to Sun Microsystems Inc. inthe fast-growing work station field.   Under the agreement, Digital will used Mips-designedmicroprocessors that use reduced instruction set computing, orRisc, a way to speed up computing by simplifying the steps aprocessor has to carry out. The faster Risc microprocessors areused increasingly in work stations.   ``With the addition of Risc technology, Digital will offercustomers even more versatility in computer performance to matchspecific application demands,'' said William Strecker, a Digitalvice president.   Digital stock closed at $92.62{ in composite New York StockExhange trading Wednesday, up 12{ cents.   Analysts said they expect Digital to unveil a work station usingMips chip technology by the end of the year. They said the decisionby Digital marks the first time it has strayed from its reliance onits own Vax computer design.   Analysts also said the Mips deal marks a concession to industrystandards because Risc-based systems work well with Unix, thestandard operating software made by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph.   Digital also acquired the right to use future Mips technology.In the past, Digital has designed all its computer componentsitself.</TEXT></DOC>
