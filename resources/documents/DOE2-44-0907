<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0907 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effect of thin ({similar_to}1 monolayer) overlayers of low electronegativitymetals (Cs and K) on the RT oxidation behaviour of GaAs(110) cleavagesurface is studied. This study was with Auger and Photoemission spectroscopies.Attention has been focused on the core-valence-valence and Auger lineshapeson the Ga and As 3d peaks. Presence of the alkali metal enhances theGaAs (110) oxidation rate several orders of magnitude above the cleansurface value has been found. The range 0-100 Langmuir is investigatedin detail. The oxidation process of the GaAs(110) surface in the presenceof both K and Cs overlayer follows a multi-step kinetic and reaches asaturation at exposure lower than 100 Langmuir. Both Ga and As atomsare involved in the oxygen bonding. The metal enhanced semiconductoroxidation is generally reported to be a process involving predominantlythe semiconductor surface atoms. However in the Cs - and K - GaAs case,an involvement of the alkali metal atoms too, reflected in the shapemodification of their Auger line has been found. The promotion effectof K and Cs is discussed in terms of their low electronegativity andin comparison with the results recently reported in the literature forthe other low electronegativity metals. 21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
