He clears his throat.   &quot;A lot of these investment opportunities,&quot; he says evenly,&quot;have some...impaired traits.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   With that little bit of understatement, he and hisoverworked assistant burst into laughter.   As the official in charge of the Resolution Trust Corp.'smountain of foreclosed properties, Mr. Kelly can be forgivena moment of gallows humor. His government agency faces animpossibly daunting task: It's handling the biggestreal-estate sale of the century, and it's happening at theworst possible time. Real-estate financing has dried up.Interest rates show no sign of falling soon. Most of thecountry is either charging headlong into a real-estate slumpor clawing its way back from one.   &quot;Frankly, right now, the principal factors are movingagainst us,&quot; says William Seidman, the soon-to-exit chieftainof the government's savings and loan rescue.   Nevertheless, the one-year-old RTC is trying to persuadepension funds, insurance companies, private investors,foreigners and bottom fishers to buy its repossessed realestate, more than 35,000 properties worth about $14 billionnow. The amount of unloaded property is expected to reach$100 billion by the time it's all over. If it ever is.   Mr. Kelly, who gets his drawl from his Alabama boyhood,can point to few Southern mansions on his books. It's easierto point to properties with those &quot;impaired traits.&quot; Theseinclude a Quality Inn in Phoenix whose absurdly highoperating costs would, in two years' time, make it cheaper togive away than to continue operating. Then there's the marinain Louisiana that is only a marina at high tide.   There is Estrella, the infamous 8,890-acre city in theArizona desert, meticulously planned but never built byCharles Keating, former head of the failed Lincoln Savings andamp;Loan Association. And there is a New Jersey housingdevelopment with not one but two entirely different types oftoxic waste.   Who will see ivory in this herd of white elephants? TheRTC wonders, too. &quot;There's no new Donald Trump out theregetting geared up for the '90s,&quot; sighs Mr. Kelly, director ofthe agency's asset and real-estate management division.   Most of the property is too dicey for blue-chip investorsseeking only institutional-quality real estate. Most pensionfunds, for example, have glanced at the holdings and don'tplan to look further. Roger Franz of the State of CaliforniaPublic Retirement System Fund, which has $5 billion inreal-estate holdings, sums it up succinctly: &quot;We haven'tbought anything from the RTC, nor do we anticipate acquiringRTC property.&quot;   Here's how tough sales are. At a June congressionalhearing, the question of fraudulent sales arose. An iratecongressman asked Mr. Kelly whether it wasn't possible forborrowers from an Sandamp;L to default on a real-estate loans, letthe RTC take over their properties and then come back to buythem from the RTC for 10 cents on the dollar. &quot;If they wereoffering a cash deal, I'm not sure we should turn them away,&quot;Mr. Kelly said matter-of-factly. No one on the stunnedcommittee dared argue.   Even if a buyer has the inclination, bankers aren't in themood to make real-estate loans. Borrowers across the countryare streaming into Washington to complain that theironce-friendly bankers have deserted them. &quot;Until the RTCprovides a track record {of completing real-estate sales andproviding some financing itself}, the normal financingchannels won't perform and come to the table,&quot; says NormFlynn, head of the National Association of Realtors. &quot;Everypiece of property they have is tainted, because they are theseller.&quot;   Much of the $2 billion of RTC real estate sold by the endof June went to foreign investors, who were skimming off thecream, thanks in part to a greater availability of financingoutside the U.S. Canadian investors, also taking advantage oftax benefits, are particularly on the hunt. Aaron Mills, aToronto investor, recently bought a large apartment complexin Dallas. And a 140-room hotel in Pompano Beach, Fla., wassnatched up by Raymond Malenfant, a Quebec hotel developer.   Japanese investors have been busy, too. Yukio Kitano, aninvestor from Osaka, purchased Stonebridge Ranch, a6,000-acre development with three golf courses in Dallas.   But the RTC's sheer size, and the fact that it's abrand-new bureaucracy, hampers its sales efforts. To meet acongressional deadline, for example, it rushed to compile itscatalog of real estate, and it is rife with errata. In Texas,its list of property requiring appraisals is backed up 60days. &quot;The size of the problem is a problem all by itself,&quot;says John Aldrich, an Atlanta real-estate consultant.   Watching the RTC price its inventory has been a virtualhow-not-to-market lesson. Originally, the agency reliedsolely on appraisals and wouldn't sell at anything below 95%of appraised value in depressed areas. Offers barely trickledin, but plenty of meaningless appraisals were conducted. Theagency abandoned that plan. Now, if a property doesn't sellin six months, the RTC may mark down the price 15%.&quot;Aggressive pricing,&quot; says Mr. Kelly.   But that reversal, some say, did nothing but set back theRTC clock six months. &quot;It's like playing a $50 billion pokerhand and showing the buyer your hand,&quot; says Larry Herman, aDallas real-estate agent who has sold several RTC properties.&quot;It's insanity. Who is going to buy now if they know theprice will drop in six months?&quot;   Government financing is just as sticky. Adopting a sternposture toward the kind of real-estate speculation thathelped fuel the Sandamp;L crisis, the RTC at first refused toprovide any financing. Later, it relented and agreed tofinance some sales provided there was a 25% down payment.Finally, it quietly dropped that to 15%, but the loan must beof sufficient quality for sale into the secondary market. Ofthe $2 billion in sales so far, less than $100 million haveused government financing.   It will take plenty of creative government to grease theskids, real-estate pros say. The RTC has begun tinkering withmuch bigger and more aggressive financing schemes, but theyhaven't been through the rigorous review process yet. It isconsidering, for example, pooling discounted notes onproperties where it provides financing. It is also looking atways of selling portions of loan pools that don't meet therequirements for secondary-market sale.   As the enormity of the problem sinks in, the RTC mustslash prices more aggressively even as it devises still morecreative financing schemes. The trick is doing it in such away that it steps up sales without also increasing the heatfrom a scandal-sensitive Congress and White House. &quot;You haveto try every trick that's conceivable to man to move it,&quot;says Mr. Kelly, &quot;and do it one bite at a time.&quot;   Ultimately, the RTC will rely more on the private sectorfor its heavy lifting. As more property moves through the RTCreceiverships, it is put in the hands of asset managers, whomaintain the property and market it aggressively -- cookingup the transformation of a shopping center, say, into aschool. It is also relying on such tried-and-true marketersas the Multiple Listing Service. &quot;Lots of people are lookingat our property and don't even know they are looking at ourproperty,&quot; says an RTC spokesman.   The RTC, however, does have one small advantage workingfor it: It has plenty of property from which to carry on itsown business. It is opening sales centers across the countrywhere customers can browse through property lists, loanportfolios and everything else it's purveying. The salesoffices are in repossessed property it holds. Its office inCosta Mesa, Calif., was the opulent Pacific Savings Plaza,seized this year. Its Phoenix sales office was theheadquarters of Sun State Savings andamp; Loan. In Baton Rouge, theRTC office camped in a glassed-in section in the middle of arepossessed shopping center.   &quot;We're no different from anyone else selling real estateright now,&quot; says Mr. Kelly. &quot;You have to get out there andmarket.&quot;   ---   Ms. Thomas is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
