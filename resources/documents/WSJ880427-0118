The panel also took what many industry observers said was an extraordinary step by recommending that the drug's availability to doctors be curtailed, although it left the details of such a restriction to the FDA staff to determine.    The recommendations followed the FDA panel's daylong public hearing of evidence that the drug continues to pose high risks despite numerous efforts by its manufacturer, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., to warn doctors and patients of the drug's potential problems.    The panel also recommended that the FDA implement a number of the company's proposals to intensify the warnings. These include language that would limit the drug's use to patients with only the most severe, &quot;disfiguring&quot; form of acne and new packaging that would clearly state the risk of birth defects each time a patient took an Accutane pill.    Hoffmann-La Roche, the U.S. unit of the Swiss company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., indicated it was pleased that the panel went along with its recommendations on labeling, packaging and education, and would await the details on implementing distribution restrictions before commenting.    Among the ways the FDA might curtail the drug's availability are to restrict prescribing of the drug to certain specialists, to limit its availability to certain patients, or to require a second medical opinion, perhaps in writing, before the drug can be administered.    Should the agency accept the recommendation to tighten the drug's availability, it would be the first time for it to take such action against a drug already approved and on the market, though companies on occasion have taken similar action on their own to restrict drug use. FDA staff members at the meeting weren't certain what power the agency had to implement such restrictive measures.    The agency may have to &quot;change the law, or change regulations or ask the company to voluntarily&quot; implement the restrictions, said FDA Commissioner Frank Young, noting that the agency would have its legal counsel explore the issue.    The panel's action came after lengthy testimony describing the drug's potential for producing spectacular benefits as well as terribly tragic results. Many times during the course of the day, panel members and other speakers discussed the especially difficult task of weighing the drug's usefulness versus its toxicity.    The action by the committee was the result of an intense debate that is ususally carried out by the FDA staffers behind the scenes and involves the analysis of conflicting data and the weighing of a drug's relative benefits versus its risks.    Several dermatologists described Accutane's unique ability to treat a type of scarring acne resistant to other therapies. Several showed gruesome slides of patients with disfigured faces whose problems practically disappeared after a four or five-month course of Accutane.    But several birth-defect specialists also presented instances of the drug's action on fetuses, also presenting slides and describing how even a brief exposure can produce severe physical and mental disabilities.    The panel also heard wide discrepancies in the number of birth defects, miscarriages and abortions that have resulted from the drug's use. David Graham, an FDA staffer, reported that although only 66 birth defect cases have been reported to the FDA, perhaps another 500 or so cases may have gone unreported since the drug was first marketed in 1982.    Dr. Graham, whose internal study earlier this year triggered the latest controversy surrounding the drug, also argued that the drug was being heavily overused. He said he believed the drug should be prescribed to only about 4,300 new female patients of child-bearing age each year.    Representatives of the company strongly disputed Dr. Graham's findings, saying their studies found the drug should be prescribed to about 78,000 such women a year.    But several witnesses argued along with Dr. Edward Lemmer, an expert on birth defects at the University of California, Berkeley, that &quot;this shouldn't be a body count.&quot; He added that &quot;even one birth defect case is too many.&quot;    In the end, the advisory panel members decided that they couldn't determine the degree of overuse, nor exactly how many defects may have resulted, but it was clear that more of an effort was needed to prevent the drug's exposure in pregnancies. And short of banning the drug, &quot;no matter what we do there will be some failure&quot; to prevent exposing fetuses to the drug, said panel member Paul Bergstrasser, professor of dermatology at University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas.    Accutane, generically known as isotretinoin, is part of a family of chemicals closely related to vitamin A and appears to work by shutting down production of excess oils under the skin. But like vitamin A, high doses are known to cause severe mental and physical deformities in fetuses exposed to the drug.    Among the recommendations the FDA may consider is a requirement that doctors who prescribe the drug undergo special education programs and certify they have done so. Philip Del Vecchio, a Hoffmann-La Roche official, said the company would go along with that restrictive measure and others if &quot;there was a practical way to do that.&quot; He said he was concerned that doctors would rebel against such restrictions on their practice.    &quot;Some of the distribution restrictions may require law changes that will take years to work out,&quot; said Mr. Del Vecchio. &quot;We think the FDA will go along with our program now because we can do it immediately.&quot;    Hoffmann-La Roche's U.S. sales of Accutane amount to $40 million to $50 million annually. Several witnesses said the advisory panel's recommendations would sharply reduce the drug's use. </TEXT></DOC>
