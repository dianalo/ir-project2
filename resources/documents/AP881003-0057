On specific cases, a plurality in the national poll said formerAttorney General Edwin Meese III should have been charged withcrimes, and half opposed a presidential pardon for the highestofficial charged in the Iran-Contra case, former National SecurityAdviser John M. Poindexter.   Respondents were evenly split on a pardon for Poindexter'sassistant, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.   More fundamentally, the poll of 1,125 adults found deepskepticism of the federal government's integrity. Just 40 percentthought of the government as honest overall, while 50 percent saidnot. The rest didn't know.   An even greater share, 69 percent, said the federal governmentwas poorly managed _ and more still, 82 percent, said they were notsurprised to learn of recent allegations of payoffs in the awardingof Pentagon contracts.   But the poll's most critical finding was the broad belief thatcorruption pervades the federal government: Seventy percent saidthey thought that taking illegal payoffs for special favors waswidespread.   That belief carried for majorities of all demographic groups _from a low of 60 percent of Republicans to a high of 82 percent ofliberals. Overall, just 20 percent of respondents did not believepayoffs were widespread.   The Reagan administration, however, did not carry heavy blamefor the concern over ethics. While 43 percent said theadministration had done a bad job of enforcing ethical standards ingovernment, 40 percent said it had done a good job. That was withinthe poll's three-point margin of error.   There were other signs of good will toward the Reaganadministration. Fifty-one percent said it had done a good job ofmanaging the government, even though most said the government waspoorly managed overall. And 55 percent did not blame theadministration for the Pentagon scandal.   In the Iran-Contra case, Vice President George Bush has said hehopes for an acquittal of North, who with Poindexter is accused ofconspiring to sell arms to Iran in exchange for American hostages,and to divert the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The trial willnot take place before the Nov. 8 election.   Fifty percent of the poll's respondents said Poindexter shouldhave been charged; 30 percent said not and the rest didn't know.There was a greater division on North, who gained support throughhis defense of his actions at congressional hearings last year:Forty-three percent said he should have been charged and 42 percentsaid not.   The breakdown was the same on whether President Reagan shouldpardon the men, which he has not ruled out. On Poindexter, halfopposed a pardon and 30 percent favored it; on North, 41 percentwere in favor, 44 percent opposed.   Meese, attorney general since 1985, resigned this summer, sayinghe had been vindicated of corruption allegations by a specialprosecutor's decision not to seek charges against him. Theprosecutor said Meese probably violated tax laws and conflict ofinterest laws, but did not file charges because he had no evidenceMeese sought personal gain.   In the survey, however, 46 percent said Meese should have beencharged with crimes, to 30 percent who agreed with the decision notto charge him. The remainder, 23 percent, had no opinion.   Republicans were the strongest supporters of North, Poindexterand Meese, with Democrats the greatest critics and independentsmore divided. On ethics and management as well, Republicansstrongly supported the administration and most Democrats rated itpoorly. Most independents said the administration had done well onmanagement, but they were split on ethical enforcement.
