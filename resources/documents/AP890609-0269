The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.88 per 42-gallon barrel onthe New York Mercantile Exchange, down 12 cents from Thursday, whenthe contract gained 33 cents.   Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices also fell.   Unleaded gasoline slipped 0.28 cent to 63.72 cents a gallon whilehome heating oil was off 1.63 cents to 47.03 cents a gallon. Thedrop in heating oil was attributed in part to sluggish demandtypical for this time of year.   ``Traders were feeling a lot of post-OPEC meeting depression,''said James Fiedler, an oil market analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc.   Fiedler called such a reaction by the market normal following ameeting by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   OPEC ministers agreed late Wednesday to boost the cartel'soverall production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day during theJuly-December period. The new ceiling is 1 million barrels a dayhigher than the current level but below the estimated daily outputin recent weeks of about 21 million barrels.   ``People just wanted to catch their breath and go home for theweekend and try to figure out what it means,'' Fiedler said.   He described trading as quiet.   The OPEC ministers, who reached the agreement at theirsemi-annual meeting in Vienna _ agreed to divide the extraproduction proportionately among all members.   Analysts said this means some countries will have to curtail somepumping to keep within their self-imposed quotas.</TEXT></DOC>
