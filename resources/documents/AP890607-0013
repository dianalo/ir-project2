Bennett organizing thetroops for a full-scale war, calls for decriminalization of drug useare like cries in the dark.   But the cries are getting louder and have drawn together peoplefrom disparate sides of the political spectrum _ from conservativeWilliam F. Buckley to Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, a formerprosecutor.   Advocates of such a stance point to a drop in crime ratesfollowing the 1933 end of Prohibition that had outlawed liquor salessince 1920. Today, huge drug profits and artificially high drugprices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout thecountry, they say.   Removing the profits would remove the criminals, the argumentgoes, and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessfulenforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and educationprograms.   But the Bush administration maintains the need for ``zerotolerance'' of illicit drug use, and fighting the war on drugs _even if it requires scarce federal financial resources _ is apriority on Capitol Hill. In March, Bush told one group of highschool students that legalizing drugs would be ``180 degrees wrong.''   A recent forum featuring advocates of decriminalization _organized by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and featuringpresentations by Schmoke, Princeton University Professor EthanNadelmann and attorney James Ostrowksi _ drew attendees fromBennett's Office of National Drug Control Policy, the JusticeDepartment and the Health and Human Services Department.   The three who spoke to the forum emphasized that they weren'tadvocating use of now-illicit drugs.   ``The available evidence indicates that legalization would notlead to an explosion in drug use. The repeal of alcohol prohibitiondid not,'' said Ostrowski. ``The decriminalization of marijuana inAlaska and the Netherlands did not. The cheap and ready access tococaine and narcotics in the 19th century did not.   ``The fact is, most people in our society are capable of actingresponsibly when it comes to drugs,'' he said. ``Users of nicotineare declining. Alcohol abusers are only a small percentage of thepopulation.''   The panel members differed, however, on how muchdecriminalization they want.   Schmoke stressed that although he believes marijuana use andsales should not have criminal penalties, he was not advocating thatsales of cocaine, heroin and other dangerous drugs be allowed in thesame manner that alcoholic beverages are now sold.   ``The model that I think makes the most sense is the model inHolland, in which the government treats addicts as patients and saysthat you can obtain these substances from certified healthprofessionals,'' Schmoke said. ``But if you obtain these substancesoutside the public health system, you're subject to criminalsanctions.''   Such a plan lowers the crime rate, because ``you don't have torob and steal and break into people's houses to obtain enough goodsto buy drugs,'' and it restricts the spread of AIDS that otherwisewould be transmitted through the sharing of needles, he said.   Nadelmann said that from a strict cost-benefit analysis _including money spent for enforcement of drug laws as well as thecost of violence, corruption and the need for ever-expanding prisons_ the prohibition on drugs makes no sense.   He acknowledged that while the illegality of some drugs may makesome people, particularly those in higher socioeconomic groups, stayaway from the substances, the nation can't ignore the violenceplaguing inner cities, much of it caused by the illegality of thedrug-dealers' trade.   Ever-increasing spending on unsuccessful enforcement makes nosense, Nadelmann argued.   ``Everything we've been doing in the past or that we're talkingabout doing now and that people are talking about doing in thefuture in terms of criminal justice approaches is doomed tofailure,'' he said. ``Twenty years of experience has shown that.   ``And it has nothing to do with corruption in Latin America orturf squabbles between law enforcement agencies or with whether ornot we have a drug czar or whether or not his name is WilliamBennett,'' Nadelmann said. ``What it has to do with is the nature ofthe market, the nature of the commodity and how lucrative the wholething is.''   It's impossible to wipe out all the opium fields in the world, hesaid, and it's impossible to intercept all the cocaine imported tothe United States without virtually closing down foreign trade andsealing the borders.   Former Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota said after the forumthat he remained undecided on the issue.   ``I think the strongest argument is getting the criminal elementout of the drug business,'' said McGovern, who ran unsuccessfullyfor president in 1972 and is now on the lecture circuit.   But McGovern said he doubted Congress is ready to hear thedecriminalization arguments.   ``Maybe five to 10 years down the road, you'll be getting moreserious evaluation of this side of the argument,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
