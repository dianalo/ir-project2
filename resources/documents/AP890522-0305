To cartoon buffs, that saysit all. These are the great ones, the Warner Bros. LooneyTunes-Merrie Melodies classics that will keep you in stitches withclever lines, biting satire and unrivaled cartoon artwork.   Like Trix, they are definitely not just for kids.   Of the three collections, top honors go to ``Bugs BunnyClassics.'' It includes ``Racketeer Rabbit,'' which parodies movietough guys Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre. ``Hare Trigger,'' anearly Bugs-Yosemite Sam duel, is high on the hilarity list, as is``Haredevil Hare,'' in which Bugs defends the honor of Earthagainst a little Martian with high-top sneakers named Commander X-2.   The title ``The Best of Bugs Bunny andamp; Friends,'' is aconsiderable exaggeration. It includes the wonderful ``TweetiePie,'' a 1947 incarnation of that not-so-innocent ``wittle bird.''But two of the seven cartoons contain racial stereotypes of anAfrican hunter and American Indian that were offensive then andremain so today.   As the name implies, ``Wabbit Twouble'' is 54 minutes worth ofBugs outwitting Elmer Fudd. Especially funny is ``The Old GrayHare,'' in which an aging Bugs (``dern this lumbago!'') is stilltoo much for hapless Elmer.   But ``Wabbit Twouble'' also illustrates the built-in problemBugs' creators had: creating a comic foil smart enough to spar withthe Wascally Wabbit. Over time, Elmer was just too stupid to remaininteresting or funny. Others, such as Yosemite Sam came along, butin his recent autobiography, voice impressionist Mel Blanc saidYosemite was pretty tough on his vocal chords.   _ By Lee Mitgang, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Memories of Me'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. RatedPG-13)      ``Memories of Me'' is almost a completely forgettable movieuntil its final third, when there's _ finally _ some action to thedrama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years ofestrangement.   ``Memories'' is Henry Winkler's first outing as a director andit shows in the movie's pacing. Much of the beginning is ploddingand self-consciously slow. Poignant moments when young Dr. AbbiePolin (Billy Crystal) reflects on his callous father hangrelentlessly on dead air.   Crystal co-wrote the film and created a girlfriend (JoBethWilliams) for himself, whose role in the melodrama-comedy is vague.At times, her only purpose seems to be to admire Crystal's rear endor his sexual prowess!   The plot finally gets going when Crystal, after suffering a mildheart attack, treks from New York to Los Angeles to resolve thedecades of paternal indifference. Once he's there, Abbie learns hisdad, Abe the King of Hollywood Extras (Alan King), has a terminalillness.   They try to win Abe a speaking part in a movie and validate hisoft-repeated claim, ``I am an actor.'' In the process, Abbie comesto love his curmudgeonly dad, who returns the favor by softeningenough to tell Abbie he loves him, too, and that in his role asfather he was simply miscast.   It gets a bit cornball after this, but the ending is far morecompelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slowstart.   _ By Patricia Bibby, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:   G _ General audiences.
