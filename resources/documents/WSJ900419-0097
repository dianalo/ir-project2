Donald Phillips, chairman, president and chief executiveofficer, told the annual meeting, &quot;Substantial capitalinvestments and further improvements in productivity will berequired to remain a low-cost nickel producer.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Unit production costs at Inco, the Western world's largestnickel producer, increased about 24% in 1989. Mr. Phillipssaid costs are likely to increase between 5% and 10% thisyear. He said the increase is mostly a result of lower oregrades and continued strength of the Canadian dollar againstother currencies.   Inco posted a 76% decline in first-quarter earnings to$67.7 million, or 64 cents a share, from $276.3 million, or$2.60 a share, a year earlier.   Sales fell 34% to $734.5 million from $1.12 billion.   The company said its realized price for nickel in thequarter was $3.69 a pound, down from $6.59 a year earlier.Mr. Phillips said the company's realized price now runs about10 to 20 cents above the trading price of nickel on theLondon Metal Exchange, where it is currently quoted at about$3.85 a pound.   Industry analysts are divided on the near-term directionof the metal, but most see a slip below $3 a pound as adistinct possibility before year end.   &quot;I think the rally in January and February has fizzled,&quot;said Julian Baldry, senior mining analyst with NesbittThomson Deacon Inc. He said the price of nickel depends to alarge degree on auto sales, housing starts and durable goodsorders, all of which have bearish outlooks. He said heexpects the metal to decline below $3 a pound this year.   &quot;I see a fabulous time for the company in the longer term,but I think we have a valley to travel through first,&quot; Mr.Baldry said.   Analysts also are concerned about Inco's debt level andreduced cash flow, which is earnings plus depreciationallowances. The company has about $1 billion in debt, largelya result of a $1 billion special dividend paid in early 1989.   In a recent report, John Lydall, an analyst with FirstMarathon Securities Ltd., said Inco's debt level isn'tunusual for a company of its size, &quot;but when combined with ashortage of liquid assets, reduced cash flows and a highcapital expenditure program, it's not a comfortablesituation.&quot;   Mr. Phillips, the chief executive, disagrees. &quot;I thinkwe're in a very, very strong financial position,&quot; he said.   Alan Ferry, an analyst with Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., agreed that the company is in good shape. He said hedoesn't see any financial problems for Inco, as long asnickel stays in the range of $3 to $4 a pound.   About $155 million of the company's capital spendingbudget will go to a $400 million sulfur dioxideemission-reduction program, Inco said. It said a &quot;significantportion&quot; will go to the development of existing and newnickel mines in Ontario and Manitoba, as well as to theexpansion of nickel production capacity in Indonesia.   Mr. Phillips said that while 1990 probably won't beanother record earnings year for the company, it &quot;could stillbe a very good year.&quot; But he said, &quot;How we will fare duringthe balance of this year cannot be predicted with any greatcertainty.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Inco sharesclosed at $24.875, unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
