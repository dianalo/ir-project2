Reporters traveling withSecretary of State James Baker, who will attend a NATO meeting in Copenhagen,Denmark, were told that President Bush met Wednesday morning with Baker; thenational security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; the chairman of the Joint Chiefsof Staff, Gen. Colin Powell; and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney in an effortto get them to hammer out a common American position on the remaining issuesin the strategic arms reduction treaty. Scowcroft has tended to be the mostdubious about the benefits and verifiability of a strategic-arms treaty --known as START -- while Baker has been the official most in favor of tying itup quickly. If the American officials can sort out their differences, and theSoviets can do the same, Baker and Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykhwould meet somewhere in Europe on Friday or Saturday to see how much of thetreaty they can tie up.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  U.S., SOVIETS WORK HASTILY FOR ARMS PACT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Foreign News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910606  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  187  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 6, 199100158209,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
