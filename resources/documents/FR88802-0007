Ass'n v. Mathews, 543 F.2d 284, 286-287 (D.C.Cir. 1976), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit explained the purpose of this legislation:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Color Additive Amendments of 1960 reflect a Congressional andadministrative response to the need in contemporary society for a scientificallyand administratively sound basis for determining the safety of artificialcolor additives, widely used for coloring food, drugs, and cosmetics. TheAmendments reflect a general unwillingness to allow widespread use of suchproducts in the absence of scientific information on the effect of theseproducts on the human body. The previously used system had some glaringdeficiencies, and the 1960 Amendments were designed to overcome them. ** *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Footnotes omitted.)</ITAG>As amended, section 706(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 376(a)) provides that a color additive will be deemedunsafe for use in food, drugs, cosmetics, and some medical devices unlessFDA has issued a regulation permanently listing that color additive forits intended use. FDA will issue such a regulation only if it has beenpresented with data that establish with reasonable certainty that no harmwill result from the use of the color additive. The burden of presentingsuch data is on the person who is seeking approval of the use of the additive.In passing the amendments, Congress provided for the provisional listingof the color additives in use at that time, pending completion of the scientificinvestigations needed for a determination about the safety of these additives(section 203(b) of the transitional provisions of the amendments, TitleII, Pub. L. 86-618, 74 Stat. 404-407 (21 U.S.C. 376, note)). Section 81.1(21 CFR 81.1) of the agency's color additive regulations enumerates thosecolor additives that are still provisionally listed. Among them is Dandamp;CRed No. 36 for use in drugs and cosmetics.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Regulatory History</ITAG>A. The Color AdditiveDandamp;C Red No. 36, a reddish orange dye of the monoazo class, is identifiedin <T3>Chemical Abstracts </T3>as 1-[(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol(CAS Reg. No. 2814-77-9). It is identified in andSection; 82.1336 (21 CFR82.1336) as 1-(<T3>o</T3>-chloro-<T3>p</T3>-nitrophenylazo)-2-naphthol. Other names include Colour IndexPigment Red 4 (C.I. No. 12085), Permanent red R, and Permaton red.The color additive is manufactured by diazotization of 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzenaminein acid medium and coupling with 2-naphthalenol in acid medium. Dandamp;CRed No. 36 is insoluble in water and alcohols.Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is used in a few ingested drug preparations and a fewexternally applied drugs. It is used in cosmetics such as lipstick, skincare, and makeup preparations.The color additive Dandamp;C Red No. 36 has been in use for many years. BecauseDandamp;C Red No. 36 was in use at the time the Color Additive Amendmentsof 1960 were enacted, it was provisionally listed for drug and cosmeticuse in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 12, 1960 (25 FR 9759).In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 12, 1960 (25 FR 9759), the agencyestablished temporary tolerances for the provisional listing of certaincolor additives for use in lipsticks, ingested drugs, and other productssubject to ingestion, such as mouthwashes and dentifrices. These temporarytolerances, based on preliminary usage information and toxicity data availableat that time, were intended to limit use of the color additive to safelevels until all required toxicity tests were completed. A publicationon April 14, 1970 (35 FR 6045) added Dandamp;C Red No. 36 to the temporarytolerances list. The agency has revised the temporary tolerances over theyears as additional data became available, the latest revision being onAugust 21, 1979 (44 FR 48964). Dandamp;C Red No. 36 usage is limited underthe temporary tolerances in 21 CFR 81.25 to 3.0 percent by weight in lipcosmetics, to 1.70 milligrams (mg) per daily dose of drugs, and to amountsconsistent with good manufacturing practice in mouthwashes and dentifrices.Between 1960 and February 4, 1977, FDA postponed the closing date for theprovisional listing of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 several times. The agency grantedthese postponements in response to requests for additional time to completethe scientific investigations necessary for listing the color additiveunder section 706 of the act.B. The Color Additive PetitionIn the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 6, 1973 (38 FR 21199), FDA announcedthat a petition (CAP 9C0089) for the permanent listing of Dandamp;C Red No.36 as a color additive for use in drugs and cosmetics had been filed bythe Toilet Goods Association, Inc. (now the Cosmetic, Toiletry and FragranceAssociation (CTFA)), c/o Hazleton Laboratories, Inc., P.O. Box 30, FallsChurch, VA 22046 (now 9200 Leesburg Turnpike, Vienna, VA 22180).The petition was filed under section 706 of the act (21 U.S.C. 376). Alater notice (41 FR 9584; March 5, 1976) amended the notice of filing ofthe petition to include the additional use of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in cosmeticsintended for use in the area of the eye.FDA notified the petitioner by letters dated May 14, 1976, August 15, 1977,and August 4, 1978, of the need for data to support the use of Dandamp;CRed No. 36 in cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. In a fourthletter, dated October 24, 1978, FDA advised the petitioner to considerwithdrawing the portion of the petition that sought approval of the useof Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in cosmetics intended for use in the area of theeye because it appeared that the required data from eye-area studies werenot readily available.The petitioner has not submitted the required data on eye-area use. Therefore,FDA considers that portion of the petition that relates to the listingof Dandamp;C Red No. 36 for eye-area use to be withdrawn without prejudicein accordance with the provisions of andSection; 71.4 (21 CFR 71.4). Useof Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in the area of the eye has never been covered bythe provisional listing of this color additive.The petitioner for CAP 9C0089 requested a regulation permitting up to 1.7mg of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 per daily dose in ingested drugs, up to 3 percentof the color additive in cosmetics subject to ingestion, and use in amountsconsistent with current good manufacturing practice in other cosmeticsand topically applied drugs. These uses and limitations are the same asthe current uses and limitations under the provisional listing.The petitioner has provided data concerning current use of the color additivein cosmetics which show a wide range of use levels within the limitationof three percent in lip cosmetics.The petitioner has not provided information, however, on use levels indrugs. The agency searched its new drug application files for data on currentuse levels of the color additive and found three products, all tablets,that contain the color additive. The largest amount used in any productis 18 micrograms (andCx.18;g) per tablet.Section 706(b)(7)(B) states that if a tolerance limitation is necessaryto assure that a proposed use of a color additive is safe, the Secretaryof Health and Human Services (the Secretary) shall not fix a tolerancelimitation at a level higher that he finds to be reasonably required toaccomplish the intended physical or other technical effect. Based on currentuse in ingested drugs, the agency believes that an intended coloring effectcan be accomplished in any future product at a level below that requestedby the petitioner. The agency concludes that a limitation of 1.0 mg ofDandamp;C Red No. 36 per daily dose of an ingested drug is sufficient andmore appropriate than the 1.7 mg originally requested by the petitioner.The agency is willing to reconsider this limitation if further informationis presented in a petition to amend the regulation.C. Toxicological Testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 36In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 4, 1977 (42 FR 6992), FDA publishedrevised regulations that required new chronic toxicity studies on 31 coloradditives, including Dandamp;C Red No. 36, as a condition for continued provisionallisting for ingested uses. FDA required the new toxicity studies becausethe earlier toxicity studies that the petitioners had submitted to supportthe safe use of these color additives were deficient in several respects.FDA described these deficiencies in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 23, 1976 (41 FR 41860):<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Many of the studies were conducted using groups of animals, i.e.,control and those fed the color additive, that are too small to permitconclusions to be drawn today on the chronic toxicity or carcinogenic potentialof the color. The small number of animals used does not, in and of itself,cause this result, but when considered together with the other deficienciesin this listing, does do so. By and large, the studies used 25 animalsin each group; today FDA recommends using at least 50 animals per group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In a number of the studies, the number of animals surviving toand meaningful age was inadequate to permit conclusions to be drawn todayon the chronic toxicity or carcinogenic potential of the color additivestested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In a number of the studies, an insufficient number of animals wasreviewed histologically.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. In a number of the studies, and insufficient number of tissueswas examined in those animals selected for pathology.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. In a number of the studies, lesions or tumors detected under grossexamination were not examined microscopically.</ITAG>In the February 4, 1977, rule, FDA postponed the closing date for the provisionallisting of the color additives until January 31, 1981, for the completionof required toxicity studies.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 27, 1981 (46 FR 18954), FDA establishedthe closing date of September 30, 1984, for the completion of the evaluationof Dandamp;C Red No. 36. Because its review of the data and of the scientificand legal issues raised on this color additive took longer than the agencyanticipated, FDA had to extend the provisional listing of the color additiveon a number of occasions. On June 26, 1985 (50 FR 26377), FDA proposeda longer extension of the provisional listing for several color additives,including Dandamp;C Red No. 36, to provide for the submission of additionalinformation.On September 4, 1985 (50 FR 35783), the agency published a final rule extendingthe provisional listing for Dandamp;C Red No. 36 until March 3, 1987. OnJuly 30, 1986, CTFA submitted additional information, which is discussedbelow. To provide time for the completion of its review and preparationof the appropriate documents, the agency further extended the closing dateby publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and established the current closing date of August30, 1988, on July 1, 1988 (53 FR 25127).D. Citizen Petition Filed by Public Citizen Health Research GroupOn December 17, 1984, the Public Citizen Health Research Group (PublicCitizen) petitioned FDA to ban the use of the color additives that remainedprovisionally listed. On January 22, 1985, Public Citizen filed a complaintin the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking the same relief.Public Citizen alleged that, by continuing to provisionally list the coloradditives, including Dandamp;C Red No. 36, FDA had violated the Color AdditiveAmendments to the act, as well as those provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 706(1)) that pertain to unreasonable delay of agencyaction. Public Citizen sought to enjoin FDA from using the provisionallist or any other means to allow the marketing of the provisionally listedcolor additives.On June 21, 1985, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs sent a detailed responseto the petition to Public Citizen. In his response, the Commissioner carefullyreviewed and discussed the arguments and information submitted in supportof the petition. The Commissioner concluded that the public health wouldnot be endangered by the continued marketing of the color additives whilescientific, legal, and policy issues were addressed and, therefore, theCommissioner denied the petition.On February 13, 1986, Judge Stanley S. Harris granted FDA's motion forsummary judgment and dismissed Public Citizen's complaint. <T3>Public Citizen, et al. </T3>v.<T3> DHHS, </T3>et al., No. 85-1573 (D.D.C. February 13, 1986). PublicCitizen's appeal of this decision was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals,No. 86-5150 (October 23, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Evaluation of Toxicological Tests With Dandamp;C Red No. 36</ITAG>A.Statutory Safety RequirementsUnder section 706(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 376(b)(4)), the so-called``general safety clause'' for color additives, a color additive cannotbe listed for a particular use unless the data presented to FDA establishthat it is safe for that use. Although what is meant by ``safe'' is notexplained in the general safety clause, the legislative history makes clearthat this word is to have the same meaning for color additives as for foodadditives. (See H. Rept. 1761, ``Color Additive Amendments of 1960,'' Committeeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1960).) TheSenate report on the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concept of safety used in this legislation involves the questionof whether a substance is hazardous to the health of man or animal. Safetyrequires proof of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result fromthe proposed use of an additive. It does not_and cannot_require proof beyondany possible doubt that no harm will result under any conceivable circumstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This was emphasized particularly by the scientific panel which testifiedbefore the subcommittee. The scientists pointed out that it is impossiblein the present state of scientific knowledge to establish with completecertainty the absolute harmlessness of any chemical substance.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">S. Rept. 2422, ``Food Additives Amendment of 1958,'' Committee onLabor and Public Welfare, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1958).FDA has incorporated this concept of safety into its color additive regulations.Under 21 CFR 40.3(i), a color additive is ``safe'' if ``there is convincingevidence that establishes with reasonable certainty that no harm will resultfrom the intended use of the color additive.'' Therefore, the general safetyclause prohibits approval of a color additive if doubts about the safetyof the additive for a particular use are not resolved to an acceptablelevel in the minds of competent scientists.The general safety clause is buttressed by the anticancer or Delaney clause,section 706(b)(5)(B) of the act, which provides that a color additive shallbe deemed to be unsafe ``for any use which will or may result in ingestionof all or part of such additive, if the additive is found by the Secretaryto induce cancer when ingested by man or animal, or if it is found by theSecretary, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of thesafety of additives for use in food, to induce cancer in man or animal,''and it shall be deemed unsafe ``for any use which will not result in ingestionof any part of such additive, if, after tests which are appropriate forthe evaluation of the safety of additives for such use, or after otherrelevant exposure of man or animal to such additive, it is found by theSecretary to induce cancer in man or animal'' (21 U.S.C 376(b)(5)(B)).Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbiaheld that, once FDA finds that a color additive ``induces'' cancer, theDelaney clause denies FDA the authority to approve the color. See PublicCitizen, et al. v. Young, et al. (D.C. Cir. No. 86-1548, October 23, 1987).B. Earlier StudiesAmong the earlier toxicity studies on the color additive, submitted bythe petitioner before 1977, were acute oral toxicity studies in rats andmice; short-term feeding studies in dogs, mice, and rats; chronic feedingstudies in dogs and rats; a one-generation and a three-generation reproductionstudy in rats; teratology studies in rats and rabbits; short-term dermalstudies in rabbits; and a chronic skin-painting study in mice. Only minortoxic effects were seen in the pre-1977 feeding studies, and the agencyconcluded that the color additive could be used safely until the completionof further testing.From the earlier studies with Dandamp;C Red No. 36 submitted by the petitioner,the agency has evaluated the dermal safety of the color additive. The datafrom these studies demonstrate that Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is nonirritatingwhen applied repeatedly to skin. Furthermore, Dandamp;C Red No. 36 was notfound to be carcinogenic when it was applied periodically to the skin ofmice over their lifetimes. No adverse effects in reproduction and teratologystudies were seen.Only fragmentary information on genotoxicity of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is availablefrom the scientific literature. While some in vitro tests using differentstrains of the bacterium <T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3> were claimed to be positive with Dandamp;CRed No. 36, other were negative. No information is available from severalother kinds of the tests that are normally relied upon for making judgmentsabout genotoxicity. Given the incomplete and inconsistent nature of theavailable data from the in vitro testing, and the fact that FDA considersthe full complement of animal toxicity studies to provide more pertinentinformation on safety than these in vitro tests, FDA finds no basis forfurther concern.C. New Studies Reports were submitted to FDA on the new chronic toxicity studies in ratsand mice required by the February 4, 1977, order. These new studies representcurrent state-of-the-art toxicological testing. The protocols for thesestudies have benefited from knowledge of deficiencies in previously conductedcarcinogenesis bioassays and other chronic toxicity protocols. The useof large numbers of animals of both sexes, pilot studies to determine maximumtolerated dosages, two control groups (thereby effectively doubling thenumber of controls), and in utero exposure in one of the two species tested,significantly increase the power of these tests to detect treatment-relatedeffects.Chronic studies were conducted for the petitioner by Litton Bionetics,Inc., Kensington, MD. The color additive fed to the animals in these studiescontained 97 to 98 percent total color.In the new chronic mouse study, Dandamp;C Red No. 36 was fed to Charles RiverCD-1 mice at dietary levels of 0, 0.05, 1.0, and 5.0 percent for a maximumduration of 106 weeks. Sixty females and 60 males were used for each dietarylevel and in each of 2 control groups. The 5.0 percent dose mice, comparedto the controls, showed increased spleen weights in males and increasedkidney and liver weights in females. There was also an increased incidenceof extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleens of male mice fed 5.0 percent.No adverse effects were seen at the 1.0 or 0.05 percent levels. Based onthe evaluation of the results of this chronic mouse toxicity study, theagency has determined that Dandamp;C Red No. 36 did not cause cancer in CharlesRiver DC-1 mice.In one chronic study, Sprague-Dawley (Charles River CD) rats were fed dietarylevels of 0, 0.01, 0.025, and 0.1 percent of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 for 28to 29 months. These rats were exposed in utero and during lactation bythe feeding of the same dietary levels of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 to their parents.Seventy females and 70 males were used for each dietary level and in eachof 2 control groups. A related second study was performed with the same strain of rats, in whichthe animals, similarly exposed in utero and during lactation, were fedeither 0 or 2.0 percent of Dandamp;C Red No. 36. FDA requested that thisfeeding level be added to provide testing at the highest level compatiblewith completion of the test. The agency's analysis of data from earlierstudies suggested that this maximum level of 2.0 percent could be usedwithout jeopardizing completion of the study. The females were sacrificedat 120 weeks of feeding and the males at 127 weeks. There were 70 animalsof each sex in each group. Male rats fed 0.1 percent or 2.0 percent of the color additive showed gastrointestinaltract irritation. Rats fed 2.0 percent showed adverse effects associatedwith anemia, including decreased erythrocyte counts, decreased hematocrits,decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased reticulocyte counts. Both malesand females of this dose group showed a marked increase in parenchymalfibrosis of the spleen compared to their controls. Both sexes also hadother splenic changes, that is, increased organ weights, capsular thickening,capsular fibrous tags, extramedullary hematopoiesis,and pigmentation. Onemale rat fed 2.0 percent of the color additive had a fibrosarcoma in thespleen. Based on the evaluation of the results of both chronic rat studies,the agency has determined that Dandamp;C Red No. 36 did not cause cancerin Sprague-Dawley rats. No adverse effects were seen at the 0.025 percentlevel or below. D. The Issue of Whether More Testing Is Necessary 1. <T3>Statement of the issue. </T3>In a notice of proposed rulemaking (50FR 26377; June 26, 1985), FDA stated that the chronic testing of both Dandamp;CRed No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 did not reveal a carcinogenic effectin the animals in which they were tested. There were increased incidencesof splenic lesions that are unusual, but not neoplastic, in Sprague-Dawleyrats fed high doses of either color additive; and there were a few splenictumors with Dandamp;C Red No. 33. With Dandamp;C Red No. 36, there were higherincidences of parenchymal fibrosis, enlargement, capsular thickening, capsularfibrous tags, and extramedullary hematopoiesis of the spleen. With Dandamp;CRed No. 33, there were higher incidences of parenchymal fibrosis, enlargement,capsular fibrosis, and (in males) fatty metamorphosis of the spleen. Therewas one splenic fibrosarcoma with Dandamp;C Red No. 36, and in the 140 ratsfed Dandamp;C Red No. 33 there were three fibrosarcomas, one capsule hemangioma,and one fibroma. In the proposal, FDA stated that if it had only results of the testingof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 before it, the agency wouldin all likelihood have approved the use of these color additives becausethe observed effects, standing alone, did not raise any safety concerns.However, the proliferative effects seen in the testing of Dandamp;C Red No.33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 indicated to FDA that there was a similaritybetween these color additives and certain other compounds, such as Dandamp;CRed No. 9, that have been shown to be carcinogenic. When Dandamp;C Red No.9 was fed to Sprague-Dawley rats, a few rare tumors and numerous rare lesionsof the spleen were produced. These rats had the same kinds of nonneoplasticlesions as with Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36. When Dandamp;CRed No. 9 was fed to Fischer 344 rats, however, numerous rare tumors ofthe spleen were produced, and Dandamp;C Red No. 9 was found to be a spleniccarcinogen in this strain. The association between the nonneoplastic splenic lesions and the occurrenceof tumors suggested to FDA that the nonneoplastic lesions may be precursorsor indicators of the start of a carcinogenic process. This similarity ofeffects in the Sprague-Dawley strain of rats between Dandamp;C Red No. 33and Dandamp;C Red No. 36, on the one hand, and Dandamp;C Red No. 9, on theother, raised concerns that Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 maybe carcinogenic in the Fischer 344 rat. To clarify the significance ofthis similarity of effects, FDA proposed that new studies be conductedon Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 (50 FR 26377). The agencystated that it believed such studies would be the best way to resolve theambiguities about these color additives that have been created by the resultsof the testing with Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and other compounds in Fischer 344rats. The agency also noted, however, that it would reconsider the issueof additional testing if data and information were received that showedthat such testing was not necessary. In an earlier approach to this problem, FDA, in 1984, had asked a panelof experts from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to examine the dataon Dandamp;C Red No. 33 (but not on Dandamp;C Red No. 36) in conjunction withthe data on Dandamp;C Red No. 9. The NTP panel agreed with agency scientiststhat there were similarities between the nonneoplastic splenic effectsproduced by Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9. They also thoughtthat the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a carcinogenic effectfrom Dandamp;C Red No. 33 treatment. The NTP panel recommended that furtherresearch be done to gain a better understanding of ``the mechanisms ofthe toxic action of this particular family of compounds in the spleen ofrats.'' The NTP panel did not consider the level of human exposure or whetherthis color additive posed an actual health concern. Comments from the petitioner, on the 1985 proposal, suggested that conductinga risk assessment based on the comparative toxicities of Dandamp;C Red No.9, Dandamp;C Red No. 33, and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in Sprague-Dawley rats wouldshow that additional testing would not be necessary. The petitioner latersubmitted a lengthy comparative assessment on the relative splenic toxicitiesof these three color additives. 2. <T3>Resolution of the issue. </T3>The agency carefully considered the petitioner'scomments and concluded that if the splenic toxicity associated with theuse of these color additives were produced by the major components of thecolors, then it should be possible to evaluate the health concern raisedby the color additives using the data from the studies involving the Sprague-Dawleyrat and the Dandamp;C Red No. 9 study in the Fischer 344 rat. FDA concludedthat knowledge of the relative toxicities of these additives would enablethe agency to make a determination about the safety of Dandamp;C Red No.33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 without requiring new long-term studies. See50 FR 35788; September 4, 1985. FDA has conducted its own comparative evaluation based on the relativetoxicities of Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 (Ref. 1). The assessmentshows that even assuming that Dandamp;C Red No. 36 were carcinogenic if subjectedto further testing in a strain of rat other than the Sprague-Dawley, thetheoretical, upper-bound, lifetime risk associated with exaggerated useexposure to the compound would be extremely small, that is, less than 8X10^8(Ref. 2). In light of this comparative evaluation, the agency has reconsidered whetheradditional chronic testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is necessary to establishthe safety of the compound. When deciding whether to require additionaltesting for a compound under review, the agency routinely follows the principlearticulated in its toxicology guidelines that ``the degree of effort expendedin reducing uncertainty about the safety of an additive ought to relatein some concrete way to the likelihood that the substance poses a potentialfor health risk to the public * * *.'' (Ref. 3, p. 10). By showing thatthe splenic toxicity presents no reasonable likelihood of harm to the public,the assessment removes the agency's initial concern that additional testingof the additive was necessary. In fact, in light of the assessment, torequire additional testing would be pointless from a public health perspectiveand contrary to agency practice. Accordingly, the agency concludes thatthe existing carcinogenicity studies concerning Dandamp;C Red No. 30 areadequate for the evaluation of this color additive.E. Evidence for the Safety of Dandamp;C Red No. 361. <T3>Adequacy of the submitted studies to demonstrate safety. </T3>The seriesof studies completed by the petitioner and discussed in sections B andC fulfills the usual requirement to demonstrate safety for a color additivethat will be ingested or applied dermally. The studies were properly conductedand are satisfactory by today's standards of toxicity testing. Agency scientistshave found no adverse effects related to treatment with the color additivein doses up to the highest dose of 12.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)in the teratology studies or the reproduction studies. The long-term studiesin dogs, mice, and rats showed no effect levels at 0.125 percent (31 mg/kg)in dogs, 1.0 percent (1,500 mg/kg) in mice, and 0.025 percent (12.5 mg/kg)in rats. Thus, the safety studies established a no-observed-effect-levelof 12.5 mg/kg body weight or higher in all species tested.2. <T3>Negative results of carcinogenicity studies. </T3>As discussed above,the agency believes that these studies are adequate to determine the carcinogenicityof Dandamp;C Red No. 36. No increased incidence of any type of tumor, inany of the many tissues examined, in either sex, in any dose group, inany strain of any species tested, by either ingestion or skin application,in any of the studies, was associated with Dandamp;C Red No. 36 treatment.Thus, the agency concludes that the completed studies show that Dandamp;CRed No. 36 does not induce cancer in the strains of animals tested underthe conditions of these studies. As a consequence, the Delaney clause isnot applicable to this color additive.3. <T3>Conclusion. </T3>For the foregoing reasons, the agency considers thatthe direct testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 shows that the color additiveis safe for use in drugs and cosmetics. The agency must still consider,however, any risk posed by the possibility of a carcinogenic impurity inDandamp;C Red No. 36.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Potential Risk From a Carcinogenic Impurity</ITAG>During the safety review, the agency developed a new analytical methodologyfor examining the color additive for the presence of trace level impurities.Analyses by this new methodology found an impurity, 1-[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, in commercial, certified batches of Dandamp;C Red No.36 (Ref. 4). This chemical can form as an impurity during the process ofmanufacturing Dandamp;C Red No. 36. This chemical is the main component ofDandamp;C Orange No. 17, which was found to be carcinogenic (48 FR 14045;April 1, 1983). To ensure that any risk from a carcinogenic impurity isnot overlooked, the agency is considering the carcinogenicity of Dandamp;COrange No. 17 to be attributable to its main component. In evaluating therisk from this chemical as a carcinogenic impurity of Dandamp;C Red No. 36,the agency used estimates of carcinogenic potency for Dandamp;C Orange No.17 together with estimates of exposure to the impurity for users of Dandamp;CRed No. 36.Because of its concerns about the impurity, the agency has analyzed representativesamples from 27 certified batches of the color additive (Ref. 4). Detectableamounts of the impurity were found in 15 commercial batches of Dandamp;CRed No. 36, ranging from a trace amount to 0.45 percent. The average impuritylevel was 0.13 percent. From 0.02 to 0.45 percent was found in the samplesused for chronic studies in rats and mice.A. Prior Actions by FDAThe current testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 has not proven it to be a carcinogen,and, thus, the anticancer clause does not apply to it. Nevertheless, theagency must still consider whether the color additive, in light of thefact that it may contain a carcinogenic impurity, may be safely used indrugs and cosmetics.The agency is using the same approach for this situation concerning theimpurity in Dandamp;C Red No. 36 as it used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in other color additives(50 FR 35774; September 4, 1985 and 51 FR 41765; November 19, 1986). Thesecolor additives had not been shown to be carcinogenic by appropriate bioassays.FDA concluded that the use of each of these color additives, within prescribedspecifications, is safe. The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>728 F. 2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5 (47 FR 24278;June 4, 1982), which contained a carcinogenic chemical but has not itselfbeen shown to cause cancer. Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency'sdecision to list Dandamp;C Green No. 5, the U.S. Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit rejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listingregulations. The risk assessment procedure used to estimate risk from the impurity hastwo aspects: (1) Assessment of the probable exposure to the impurity fromthe proposed use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of carcinogenicpotency observed in the animal bioassay with the impurity to the conditionsof probable human exposure. B. Exposure to the Carcinogenic Impurity in Dandamp;C Red No. 36 The agency has estimated the maximum risk from exposure to the carcinogenicimpurity that may result from use of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in drugs and cosmetics.The lifetime exposure to Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is not expected to exceed 90andCx.18;g/person/day internally for the high user. With this estimate, theagency has examined the likely exposure to the carcinogenic impurity inDandamp;C Red No. 36. In adopting specifications for Dandamp;C Red No. 36, FDA considered the concentrationof the carcinogenic impurity that was present in the certified batchesof the color additive that the agency recently surveyed and in the batchesused for the toxicological testing. The agency believes that a specification of 0.5 percent 1-[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenolis readily obtainable under good manufacturing practice and will assuresafe use of Dandamp;C Red No. 36. By multiplying the high user exposure forthe color additive itself (90 andCx.18;g/person/day) by the specification,FDA estimates that the high user systemic exposure to the impurity willbe less than 0.45 andCx.18;g/person/day (Ref. 5). Systemic exposure to theimpurity from dermal application will be negligible compared to ingestionbecause the majority of exposure to this color additive results from itsingested uses and because only a small fraction of a dermally applied productis likely to be absorbed. C. Risk Estimations for the Impurity The second part of the evaluation of the risk presented by the presenceof the impurity is an extrapolation from the actual compound-related incidenceof tumors found in animal bioassays, under conditions of exaggerated exposure,to the conditions of much lower probable exposure for humans. The agency has used estimates of carcinogenic potency for Dandamp;C OrangeNo. 17 and estimates of exposure to the carcinogenic impurity for highusers of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 (with the carcinogenic impurity at the maximumconcentration allowed by the specification) to estimate risk for exposureto the impurity. FDA evaluated chronic studies with Dandamp;C Orange No. 17 in rats and miceand found that the color additive is carcinogenic to the liver of ratsand mice when administered in the diet (51 FR 28331; August 7, 1986). TheColor Additive Scientific Review Panel reviewed Dandamp;C Orange No. 17 aswell as Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and other color additives (51 FR 43877). Fromthe panel's report, the agency estimated the potency of Dandamp;C OrangeNo. 17. Using this as the carcinogenic potency for the impurity in Dandamp;CRed No. 36, it then estimated that the lifetime risk of cancer, from systemicexposure (0.45 andCx.18;g/person/day) to the impurity in products containingDandamp;C Red No. 36, is less than 3.2andmultiply;10^9 (3.2 in 1 billion) (Ref.5). The agency concludes that this risk from the impurity is negligible. FDAhas determined that the use of batches of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 that meetthe specifications adopted by this rule is safe.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Conclusions </ITAG>The agency concludes that Dandamp;C Red No. 36 is safe under the conditionsof use set forth below for general use in drugs and cosmetics, and thatcertification is necessary for the protection of the public health. Inreaching this conclusion, the agency evaluated a full battery of animalfeeding and dermal studies adequate to demonstrate the safety of a coloradditive. Based on all relevant data, including the comparative splenictoxicity evaluation, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certaintyof no harm from use of the additive and that further testing is unnecessaryand of no benefit to the public health. The final toxicity study reports, interim reports, and the agency's evaluationsof these studies are on file at the Dockets Management Branch (addressabove) and may be seen in that office between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday. The agency concludes that it is necessary to have limitations on the levelsof Dandamp;C Red No. 36 that may be used in drugs and cosmetics to ensuresafe use. As discussed above, the agency is establishing a limit for druguse that is less than that requested because available data show that higherlevels are not necessary. In the past, all of the provisionally listed color additives that werelimited by the temporary tolerances (21 CFR 81.25) were permitted for mouthwashand dentifrice use, including Dandamp;C Red No. 36. However, this color additiveis insoluble in water and in alcohol, which makes it unsuitable for theseuses and the agency has no evidence that it has been used in such products.The petitioner has not specifically requested mouthwash and dentifriceuses. Therefore, the regulations below do not provide for use of Dandamp;CRed No. 36 in mouthwashes or dentifrices. The petitioner has not submitted the required data for eye-area use. Therefore,FDA now considers that portion of the petition that included the permanentlisting of Dandamp;C Red No. 36 for eye-area use to be withdrawn withoutprejudice in accordance with provisions of 21 CFR 71.4 Use of Dandamp;C RedNo. 36 in the area of the eye has never been covered by provisional listing.The agency's listing of a color additive for general use in drugs and cosmeticsdoes not encompass eye-area use. The agency is describing the color additive in this regulation accordingto the current Chemical Abstracts nomenclature, which differs somewhatfrom the nomenclature FDA previously used. The Agency concludes that it is necessary to include in the listing regulationsfor Dandamp;C Red No. 36 a brief description of its manufacturing processto ensure the safety of the color additive. FDA has included that descriptionto define as closely as possible the color additive that has been testedand shown to be safe. The agency is providing this description becauseuse of a different manufacturing process is likely to produce differentimpurities that have not been considered in establishing specificationsfor this color additive. The agency is not able at this time to set specificationsthat would control the presence of all such impurities. FDA is willingto consider petitions for alternative manufacturing processes, but thosepetitions should contain evidence that demonstrates that those processeswill not produce impurities that will make use of the color additive unsafe.The agency has contracted with the National Academy of Sciences/NationalResearch Council (NAS/NRC) to develop appropriate specifications for coloradditives for use in food as part of the Food Chemicals Codex. Similarly,appropriate specifications for color additives for use in drugs and cosmeticswill be developed following the general guidelines used by NAS/NRC in itsevaluation of color additives used in food. The agency concludes that specifying,through a general description, the manufacturing process in the regulationsfor this color additive will provide an adequate assurance of safety untilsuitable specifications can be developed.The agency finds that because of the presence, or possible presence, ofa carcinogenic impurity in the color additive, a specification for thisimpurity is necessary to protect the public health. Specifications areincluded in the regulation also for other impurities to identify the coloradditive more precisely and to ensure that the sample tested toxicologicallyadequately represents future batches.In the past, Dandamp;C lakes have been permitted to be prepared from uncertifiedstraight color additives. The resulting lakes would subsequently be certified.However, to assure that all lakes meet the specification limits for thecarcinogenic impurity and that the use of lakes remains consistent withthe evaluation, the agency is establishing the requirement that all lakesof Dandamp;C Red No. 36 be prepared from certified batches of the straightcolor additive. Accordingly, 21 CFR 82.1336 is amended to reflect thisrequirement.This order does not permanently list Dandamp;C Red No. 36 lakes. FDA publisheda notice of intent in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 22, 1979 (44 FR 36411), which discussedthe additional information that the agency believes is needed before finalregulations on lakes can be issued. FDA intends to publish proposed regulationsgoverning the use of color additives in lakes in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the near future and concludes that the listingof color additives for use in lakes can best be implemented by generalregulations. Dandamp;C Red No. 36 lakes will, therefore, continue to be provisionallylisted for coloring drugs and cosmetics under 21 CFR Parts 81 and 82.The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(3) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
