Most government officeswere deserted.   ``Government control is eroding, but it has not disintegrated,''said a Western diplomat in Rangoon. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The influential daughter of Burma's late independence leaderspoke before 400,000 cheering protesters and demanded an interimgovernment to bring about democracy and end 26 years ofauthoritarian rule.   Aung San Suu Kyi said this alone could ease weeks of unrest thathas toppled one president and killed at least 112 people.   In another development, retired Defense Minister Gen. Tin Oowrote a letter to President Maung Maung calling for an interimgovernment, an end to one-party rule and condemned the ruling partyfor resorting to force.   Soldiers and police have virtually disappeared from the streetssince the president ended martial law Wednesday. State-run RadioRangoon since has reported looting, arson and other violence, andsaid today ``hooligans'' torched shanties in suburban areas.   Security forces opened fire to quell prison riots in threecities this week and at least seven inmates were killed, the radiosaid.   It said about 2,000 prisoners torched buildings in Insein Jaileight miles north of Rangoon today. Smoke could be seen eight milesaway from the jail, where nearly 1,700 anti-government protestershad been held. Smoke could be seen eight miles away.   In Taunggyi, 290 miles northeast of Rangoon, police andgovernment employees joined about 100,000 demonstrators demandingan interim government. Witnesses said it was the largest rally everin the Shan State capital.   Striking workers halted all rail services and Union BurmaAirways domestic flights, officials said.   Strikes also crippled most factories under the IndustriesMinistry, and blue-uniformed factory workers riding in theministry's trucks took part in the Rangoon demonstrations.   Strikes shut two oil refineries, in Syriam across the RangoonRiver and in Mann in central Burma. A strike at Rangoon port alsoleft scores of foreign ships waiting.   No newspapers appeared for the second day because workers at thesix state-run dailies stayed away to demand democracy and pressfreedom. People were reported to be hoarding goods as the price ofrice soared.   Aung San Suu Kyi has no political experience but wieldsconsiderable symbolic influence as the daughter of Aung San, wholed the country's struggle for independence from Britain and wasassassinated in 1947.   She spoke a day after the country's most outspoken dissident,Aung Gyi, also demanded an interim government. Aung Gyi spokebefore 200,000 people after he was freed from jail following amonth of detention on charges of ``attacking the state.''   Aung San Suu Kyi asked the military to be ``the people's army''and look after the people's interests.   Western diplomats in Rangoon have cited reports ofanti-government feeling in the military and said it may interveneto establish an interim government. In riots this month, securityforces in some towns reportedly let demonstrators take over localadministrations.   In an Aug. 18 letter, former teachers of the Defense ServicesAcademy urged graduates to side with the people. A copy of theletter was obtained today by The Associated Press in Bangkok,Thailand.   ``The D.S.A. did not teach you to wreck the economy of thenation nor did we teachers teach you to kill the peoplesystematically or to apprehend and torture them,'' the letter said.   ``The demonstrations and strikes started as the people werestarving,'' it said. ``It was not the work of ... rebels.''   Catholic priests and nuns sang hymns to begin today's rally in afield near the revered Shwedagon Pagoda. People of all ages andfrom all walks of life, including students and Buddhist monks,attended.   Radio Rangoon said that all 2,750 people arrested duringdemonstrations Aug. 3 to Aug. 25 in Rangoon had been releasedexcept those who committed serious crimes. It said those freedincluded 744 students, 165 government employees, and 27 Buddhistmonks.   All other protesters nationwide have been ordered released, itsaid.   The demonstrations forced hard-line President Sein Lwin'sresignation on Aug. 12 and put pressure on Maung Maung, who tookpower Aug. 19, to move toward multiparty democracy.   Maung Maung also is chairman of the ruling Burma SocialistProgram Party.   On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in Rangoonto demand immediate democracy. They rejected Maung Maung's plan tohold a party congress Sept. 12 to consider holding a popular voteon whether to end one-party rule.   When Ne Win, 77, resigned July 23 as chairman of the 1.1million-member party after 26 years in power, he accepted indirectresponsibility for bloody student-led riots in March and June andproposed a referendum on multiparty rule.   But a special party congress rejected the proposal and selectedSein Lwin to succeed him.   Sein Lwin, a former army general blamed for harsh suppression ofdissent, took power July 27 and moved quickly against hisopposition. Aung Gyi was arrested two days later in a sweep thatalso netted this correspondent.   Protests against Sein Lwin turned bloody Aug. 8 when securitypersonnel fired to disperse crowds. The government reported 112people killed, but diplomats believe the figure was much higher.</TEXT></DOC>
