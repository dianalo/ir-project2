The analysts say, however, that Chase is likely to use an option long available to it -- acquisition of a failed thrift -- rather than the costly route of buying a healthy institution under its new acquisition powers. They speculate that Chase is considering Boynton Beach, Fla.-based Beach Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association or Tampa, Fla.-based Freedom Savings andamp; Loan Association.    &quot;Those two institutions would give Chase a terrific franchise in Florida,&quot; said Ronald Goff, a banking analyst with Allen C. Ewing andamp; Co., a Tampa brokerage. He said the likelihood of such an acquisition would depend on how much assistance federal regulators are willing to provide.    Chase officials are reticent about the company's plans in Florida, which is among the most attractive banking states in the nation because of its rich deposit base and strong economy.    J. Webster Hull, president of Chase Bank of Florida, wouldn't confirm or deny that the bank is looking at acquisitions in the state, but played down the likelihood of an acquisition in the near future. &quot;We've established a presence here and an ability to expand throughout the state at a time when we think it's right,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;We see our real opportunity in the near term as being a quality lender.&quot;    In New York, Steven Rautenberg, a Chase vice president and spokesman, said the company doesn't comment on specific acquisition plans, but added, &quot;We hope to grow in Florida through what we have now, and we'll look at other opportunities.&quot;    In addition to Chase Bank of Florida, the bank holding company has in Florida a trust company, international banking operations, home-mortgage and personal-finance offices and a real estate financing operation.    In February 1986, Chase Manhattan acquired St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Park Bank of Florida from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for $62.6 million and renamed it Chase Bank of Florida.    New York banking concerns are generally barred from making bank or thrift acquisitions in Florida because New York isn't part of a Southeast regional banking pact permitting interstate mergers.    However, Chase was able to acquire Park under the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982 that permits an out-of-state commercial bank to acquire a failed commercial bank. An 18-month waiting period on further expansion set by state law ends today. With its Florida beach-head, Chase could now acquire other Florida institutions and expand throughout the state.    Charles L. Stutts, general counsel of the Florida comptroller's office, which regulates banking, said Chase is clearly free to expand. &quot;We initially thought there were state law constraints on Chase expanding,&quot; he said. &quot;But recent federal legislation removes any questions about its ability to do so.&quot;    However, analysts said that because of a depressed stock price and big writedowns on its Third-World loans, Chase couldn't easily afford to buy a healthy institution at the moment. &quot;They've had a depletion of their capital from their Third-World debt situation,&quot; said Marc Perkins, an analyst and chairman of Perkins, Smith Inc. in Tampa. &quot;They are not equipped to come in and make a big acquisition at two-and-a-half to three times book.&quot;    Mr. Perkins speculated that Chase would be &quot;conservative&quot; in expanding in Florida and unwilling to pay as much for a failed thrift as an out-of-state institution that is trying to break the interstate banking barriers to get a foothold in the state.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Chase Manhattan closed at $45.25 a share, up 50 cents.    In an interview, Stanley Waranch, chairman of the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, said a bid package for Beach Federal was distributed to interested institutions and that bids were due June 19. &quot;I understand there is more than one bid,&quot; Mr. Waranch said, declining to name specific institutions. He said the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. makes a recommendation to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board about which bid should be accepted, &quot;and the Bank Board would make the final decision.&quot;    Last week, Mr. Waranch, who also serves as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Beach Federal, said a decision is expected on Beach Federal within 30 to 60 days.    The thrift, which has branches throughout southeast Florida and the Tampa Bay area, was previously Sunrise Savings andamp; Loan Association of Boynton Beach, an unusually aggressive lender that plunged heavily into commercial real estate lending. It was placed in receivership in July 1985, then closed and reopened -- with the bad loans in its portfolio removed -- as Beach Federal in September 1986.    Mr. Waranch said a bid package isn't yet prepared for Freedom, which was taken over by federal regulators last month. &quot;They have a lot of work to do on that,&quot; he said. Freedom, which has offices throughout the Orlando and Tampa Bay areas, had assets of $1.9 billion at the time it was taken over.    In Tampa, a Freedom spokesman said he had no knowledge of Chase or another institution seeking to acquire it. </TEXT></DOC>
