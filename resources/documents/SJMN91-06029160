Some U.S. warplanes have beenordered toward the Scuds' electronic emissions transmitted at the time oflaunch but have often failed to find the launchers, a defense official said.;   And while the Scuds have limited military use, they sow terror among thosetargeted and complicate U.S. efforts to keep the anti-Iraq alliance intact.;   A top Pentagon official said firmly Monday that Iraq's fixed Scud sites havebeen demolished, but he refrained from making a similar claim about the mobileScuds.;    &quot;All 30 fixed sites have been attacked and hit -- some of them havebeen totally destroyed,&quot; said Army Lt.

U.S. Patriotmissiles appeared to have thwarted the Saudi attack, while the Scud in Israelfell out of Patriot range near Arab villages on the West Bank.;    The Scudsaren't as mobile as some officials have suggested, a Pentagon official said.Iraq most likely is firing them from sites in the desert they have alreadysurveyed to determine targeting data.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK THOMPSON, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910129  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  350  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 29, 199100029160,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
