But many money managers think theseforecasts are much too rosy.   Per-share earnings in Canada, the U.S. and Britain areprojected to soar 45.4%, 38.9% and 26.2% respectively in 1992from this year, according to new data compiled by theInstitutional Brokers Estimate System, a unit of Lynch, Jonesandamp; Ryan, New York. At the same time, analysts predict earningsgrowth in Italy, France, Germany and Japan will be moderateto poor. Lynch Jones is a wholly owned unit of New York-basedCiticorp.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts around the world predict that stocks in Canadawill sell at 14.3 times earnings over the next 12 months,14.2 times in the U.S. and 12.8 times in Britain and Italy.Price-earnings ratios for France, Germany and Japan areforecast to be 11.4%, 13.1% and 36.9% respectively.   These numbers &quot;sound beautiful; I'd love to be thatbullish and believe all that,&quot; says Claude N. Zwick, head ofequity trading for Credit Suisse in Zurich. &quot;Unfortunately,that's going a little too far.&quot; Noting the &quot;high unemploymentwe have world-wide, the very slow growth world-wide, thelarge debt overload and the banks unwilling to lend,&quot; heasks: &quot;Where will the production come from that's going toproduce these kinds of earnings?&quot;   Mr. Zwick sees 1992 as a very tough year for the world'smajor stock markets. &quot;When growth doesn't come through and ifthe earnings expected don't come through -- and the chancesare great that they won't -- then this market could be verydisappointed and we could get a sharp correction.&quot;   Similarly, W. Leslie Robb, investment director at ScottishWidows Investment Management Ltd. in Edinburgh, says that theearnings estimates for French, British and Japanese stocksare overstated. &quot;The U.S. numbers are in cuckoo land,&quot; hesays. &quot;If you get a 15% to 20% increase in profits, you'll bedoing pretty well.&quot;   On the other hand, Mayri Voute, managing director atCapital Management International (France) in Paris, looks for&quot;much better earnings in Japan&quot; than analysts forecast. Sheargues that Japanese investors &quot;are holding everything backwaiting for the {stock-market} scandals to subside.&quot;   Using a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, the IBES data representsanalysts' consensus earnings estimates for each corporationwhose stock is in a key stock index in each of the sevenmajor industrial countries, or Group of Seven.   Regarding the money managers' more pessimistic outlooks,Rick Pucci, a vice president at IBES, concedes that&quot;typically, analysts start off on the optimistic side andshave estimates as the year goes along.&quot; But he adds thatmore important than the actual estimates for individualindexes are their magnitude and direction as the yearprogresses.   One portfolio manager who thinks Mr. Pucci has a point isMark Breedon of Alliance Capital Management Corp. in London.&quot;The numbers are a fair reflection of the {economic} cycle;it's asynchronous,&quot; he says. &quot;We've seen a situation wherethe world hasn't been behaving as one economically. TheAnglo-Saxon countries entered recession first and are comingout first.&quot; He feels that the IBES forecasts for the Britishand North American stock markets are &quot;pretty balanced&quot; basedon predictions of economic growth next year.   Mr. Breedon points out that the IBES forecasts show thatanalysts are looking for recoveries in the U.S., Britain andCanada, while they expect a far weaker economic environmentin continental Europe and Japan.   One stock market where money managers seem to agree withthe analysts is the U.K.'s. British companies &quot;have anenormous backlog of orders and clean balance sheets,&quot; saysMs. Voute of Capital Management. Noting that &quot;they've had itmuch tougher than anybody else and a horrendous interest-ratecurve which nobody else has had,&quot; she sees Britain'scompanies rebounding strongly as British interest rates fallalong with inflation, which she predicts will be at 4% orbelow in the fourth quarter.   Mr. Breedon of Alliance currently sees signs of economicrecovery in Britain and expects to &quot;see significant signs ofconsumer confidence returning, brought about by lowerinterest rates.&quot;   &quot;Evidence of that is the propensity of relativelycash-rich companies to buy other companies,&quot; he says. Indeed,the past week has witnessed three major takeover bids: HansonPLC for Beazer PLC, BTR PLC for Hawker Siddeley Group PLC andWilliams Holdings PLC for Racal Electronics PLC. &quot;Basically,smart companies with cash think they can buy companies now,&quot;says Mr. Breedon.   In addition, he believes that London's stock market couldget a kick from the U.K. Treasury, which he believes will tryto push interest rates even lower as next year's generalelection approaches. &quot;And lower rates will mean -- because ofthe large element that mortgages are in the inflation index-- that inflation will come down further, albeit thatunemployment will still be rising,&quot; says Mr. Breedon.   Although the stock market has discounted much of thisscenario, Mr. Breedon still sees another rally led by stocksof companies whose fortunes are tied to consumer spending.Among such companies that Alliance particularly likes areBerkeley Group PLC, a house-building company, and LauraAshley Holdings PLC, a women's clothing maker and retailer.   Mr. Robb of Scottish Widows thinks more evidence of aneconomic pickup is needed &quot;to get the market going muchhigher.&quot; He sees the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Indextrading at 2800 to 3000 in 12 months, up from yesterday'sclosing of 2579.5. Stocks he likes include retailerKingfisher PLC.   In the U.K., says Ms. Voute of Capital Management, &quot;I likesugar, food and food distribution -- very basic, very down toearth. I like the bombed-out ones: construction and buildingmaterials.&quot;   For investors overall, she advises that next year &quot;you'vegot to be very, very patient. If you got the wrong price forsomething, you're stuck with it; you can't get rid of it.&quot;But she also says: &quot;We are in for a very respectable marketthat rewards quality. There's room for everything with value,for keeping it and holding onto it.&quot; Ms. Voute says that withinflation generally running about 4%, investors are going tohave be pleased with stocks that rise 10%. &quot;You've got toused to that,&quot; she says.</TEXT></DOC>
