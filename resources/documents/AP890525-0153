Brown told a newsconference. ``No one is quite sure what the next era will looklike.''   The study, ``National Security: The Economic and EnvironmentalDimensions,'' forecast that as the superpowers decrease militaryspending, they will devote more resources to solving ecologicalproblems of their own and of poorer countries.   ``Both the United States and the Soviet Union have pursued anelusive military superiority at the cost of their internationalecomomic standing,'' said Michael Renner, author of the report.   But, he said, ``if eiher side claims to have won the Cold War,it is surely a pyrrhic victory.''   ``Japan is probably the real winner of the arms race,'' Rennertold the news conference at Worldwatch offices. Worldwatch is anon-profit research group.   Already nations have devoted increasing attention, if notresources, to environmental protection, forming ``environmentalalliances'' to combat such problems as pollution of the Baltic Seaand the depletion of the ozone layer, the report said.   ``Environmental alliances are already beginning to cut acrossmilitary alliances,'' said Renner, noting that the nationscooperating to curb pollution in Baltic Sea include members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact: Denmark,East and West Germany, Poland the Soviet Union.   In another instance cited by Renner, ``West Germany agreed topay for sulphur dioxide scrubbers on Czechoslovakian power plantsin an effort to reduce the air pollution wafting across the border,and will probably assist East Germany in the same manner.''   Many of the ``environmental alliances'' involvegovernment-to-government contacts, said the report, but citizens'groups are already beginning to cooperate.   ``Environmental links across the East-West divide on thegrass-roots level are still in their infancy. But (environmentalgroups such as) Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, among others,are busy building contacts with the nascent Eastern European andSoviet environmental movements,'' it said.   Brown acknowledged that many Soviet citizen environmental groupswere also active in national front movements that seek greaterindependence for the Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuanian, Latvia,and Estonia.   Western groups, said Brown, were avoiding contact with theBaltic movements to avoid infringing on what the Kremlin might viewas a national security risk.   Another Worldwatch report issued earlier this year, ``Action atthe Grassroots,'' said that ``in the Soviet Union and EasternEurope, where officially sanctioned local organizations arenumerous but largely controlled by state and party hierarchies, thepolitical openness of this decade has brought the genesis, often atgreat risk to the founders, of independent citizens groups.''</TEXT></DOC>
