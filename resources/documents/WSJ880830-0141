Picture this: A small pile of gray clay, coiled like the top of a Dairy Queen cone, waddles up to the front of the television screen and stares out with puppy-dog eyes. It looks suspiciously like something unmentionable on American TV. But it isn't unmentionable in Japan.    &quot;Sorry for being stinky all the time,&quot; the little clay coil says in a squeaky voice after identifying itself. &quot;But humans who do nothing about my stinkiness are bad, too.&quot; Whereupon a strong shot of a toilet-bowl deodorizer called &quot;Shut&quot; swiftly dissolves the problem.    Japanese use earthy humor to advertise products that Americans sell ever so delicately. One hemorrhoid-preparation commercial features a man in an outlandish costume, his trousers around his ankles, sitting on a toilet and whining about pain. Another ad for a toilet-bowl cleaner is shot from inside the toilet so you can watch a wife urge her husband to stick his head inside the bowl to see how clean she got it. A tampon is advertised by a famous Japanese actress dressed up as a tampon.    &quot;People think it is fun,&quot; says Yuya Furukawa, who created both the &quot;Shut&quot; and hemorrhoid ads for Dentsu Inc., the giant Japanese ad agency.    If all this frankness seems un-Japanese, it isn't. Casualness about bodily functions has always come naturally in Japanese culture. Until recently, bathing at public baths had been mixed. One best-selling book of the Edo era (1603-1867) was &quot;The Art of Flatulence,&quot; written by a man who performed concerts in the medium. When the revered Emperor Hirohito was recovering from surgery last year, every major Japanese newspaper gave front-page coverage to his first passing of gas. (Tokyo's English-language papers skipped the event.)    In fact, the prudery that some Americans see in Japan often comes from changes Japanese have made to please Western sensibilities. For instance, the law that requires blocking out pubic hair in girlie magazines is a holdover from the U.S. occupation era. (Publishers have found several creative ways around it.)    Another reason advertisers can get away with such frankness: Japanese network-TV programming itself is rather explicit. Women are often shown on Saturday-afternoon TV frolicking topless in hot-spring baths. The soft-core pornography flick &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; and several of its sequels ran uncut on prime time, though certain body parts were blurred in accordance with the law. A late-night network-TV program shows clips from porno films and raunchy live acts.    Frankness in advertising isn't limited to TV. An ad for a Konica film developed to highlight the skin tones of babies features a naked baby boy hiding nothing. Newspaper and subway ads for laxatives and a milk-based drink show those same little gray coils, called &quot;unchi&quot; in Japanese, that are portrayed in the &quot;Shut&quot; commercial. Stores in Tokyo's trendy Shibuya section even sell T-shirts decorated with the same little picture. One strange example of Japanese candor: A tower at the headquarters of condom-maker Fuji Latex Co. is shaped like its product.    Why Japanese are more open about such matters sparks spirited debate. Some say they simply have always been relaxed about natural functions. Others attribute it to Japan's rejection of Christianity and of the morality that Christians sought to impose -- that nudity was somehow shameful. Still others say the lack of privacy in crowded Japan forces Japanese to be less self-conscious.    There may be another, simpler reason: Western-style commodes are rather new here. A boom in new homes and home renovations has spurred the replacement of traditional trench-style squat toilets with new bidet-like porcelain wonders that squirt water in several directions and blow warmed air, the so-called paperless toilets. The new toilets also present a host of new cleaning problems that require a host of new cleaning products.    &quot;There is a process of education going on,&quot; says Toshio Yamaki, a professor of advertising at Tokyo Keizai University. Mr. Furukawa, the 31-year-old Dentsu ad man, says he tried to make the ads cute so the frankness wouldn't hamper the educational process. The little clay figure had a face like &quot;Howard the Duck,&quot; he says. For G-4, the hemorrhoid medicine, Mr. Furukawa tried to find &quot;the saddest-looking man in Japan,&quot; to create sympathy.    Oddly enough, several of the toilet-humor ads are run by American companies. &quot;We were confident about our ad,&quot; says Keisuke Morimoto, the marketing director of the SmithKline Beckman Corp. Japanese affiliate that makes G-4. (The product's name itself is a pun, &quot;ji&quot; being a Japanese word for hemorrhoids.) &quot;Our one concern was how headquarters {in the U.S.} would react. They accepted it.&quot;    But no one expects such ads in the U.S. quite yet. &quot;It's just too early,&quot; says Kazuo Kohda, the managing director of Johnson Co. Ltd., the maker of &quot;Shut&quot; and a subsidiary of conservative S.C. Johnson andamp; Son Inc. of Racine, Wis. &quot;It will take another five to 10 years&quot; to get to the U.S.    Elsewhere, earthiness is catching on. A Brazilian beer commercial shows men standing at a line of urinals singing the beer's theme song. A commercial for a Danish newspaper is set in a sauna where a naked man, caught peeking at naked women in the next room, tries to use the newspaper to cover up his natural reaction. The Japanese ad for the hemorrhoid preparation won several international awards, including a Clio in New York.    Says Hideyuki Kaneko, an executive of Aoi Advertising Promotion Inc. here: &quot;In this age of excess information, to make a statement you have to be direct. The consciousness of the client is changing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
