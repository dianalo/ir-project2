Some local residents and environmentalists, however, havequestioned the wisdom of certain government and private sector proposalsfor developing alternate energy resources. Disputes have arisen overa number of concerns, including environmental degredation, intended usesof the end product, the hazards of unproven technology, inadequate publicinvolvement in decision-making, inadequate regulation, and violationof Hawaiian religious values. Researchers have been examining the disputesover four alternate energy development technologies: geothermal, biomass,OTEC, and solid waste energy recovery. The first segment of this researchprocess has involved gathering information and preparing preliminarycase reports to describe how and why the disputes evolved. These reportswere distributed in late June 1987 to participants in the disputes, interestedgovernment agencies, and private organizations. Copies are availablefrom the Program on Conflict Resolution at the University of Hawaii.</TEXT></DOC>
