In a 2-1 ruling here Friday, the court ordered the Labor Department to issue a field sanitation standard guaranteeing farmworkers access to drinking water and toilets on the job. By its order, the court said it hoped to end a &quot;disgraceful chapter of legal neglect.&quot;    The court gave the department 30 days to issue the rule. Department officials said no decision had yet been made on whether to appeal or pursue other legal options.    &quot;The rulemaking record demonstrates beyond dispute that lack of drinking water and toilets causes the spread of contagion, bladder disease and heat-prostration among farmworkers,&quot; wrote Chief Judge Patricia Wald, the author of the opinion. &quot;Yet resistance to issuing the standard . . . has been intractable.&quot;    The court noted that similar standards already exist for other types of employees covered by the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.    In October 1985, Labor Secretary William Brock gave the states 18 months to improve farmworker sanitation facilities before he would decide whether to issue federal rules. At the time, he set criteria for the states to follow in enforcing and establishing sanitation rules.    Mr. Brock's action reversed an earlier department decision against issuing a national standard. The agency had long contended that most farmworkers who would be covered by a federal regulation already are protected by state rules.    Farmworker-advocacy groups have challenged that assertion. But Mr. Brock argued that even though there was clear evidence of health risks to farmworkers from inadequate sanitary facilities, state action would be more effective than federal regulation.    The department said some states have taken action, but it declined to comment further on the matter.    The appeals court panel last week said that Mr. Brock, in delegating authority to the states, had acted &quot;beyond the scope of his discretion&quot; because Congress had decided that the federal government would take the lead in regulating occupational health. The panel also challenged as &quot;an unsupported and unrealistic hope&quot; an argument by Mr. Brock that the threat of federal regulation would prompt states into action.    The Labor Department was first petitioned to issue a field sanitation standard in 1972. Years of delays and court challenges ensued. Last week's court ruling came in a suit filed by the Farmworker Justice Fund, an advocacy group for farmworkers. </TEXT></DOC>
