Imperial, Canada's largest crude oil refiner and one ofits biggest oil and gas production concerns, also warned thatit might shut two of its five oil refineries if theirperformance doesn't improve.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Decisions on specific refineries will be made later inthe year,&quot; said Arden Haynes, chairman and chief executive ofImperial, which is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp. &quot;There is nodoubt that some rationalization is required,&quot; Mr. Haynesadded. &quot;There are just too many liters chasing too fewcustomers in the marketplace.&quot;   Imperial said the 1,000 service stations and sales anddistribution terminals will be sold or discontinued over thenext few years. That would bring to nearly 2,000 the numberof retail outlets it has sold since its $4.15 billionacquisition of Texaco Canada Inc. in 1989.   The decision follows recent cutbacks by a number of U.S.refiners and marketers hurt by weak refining margins andhigher operating costs. Amoco Corp. recently closed a smallWyoming refinery while Chevron Corp. said it will close allor part of its giant Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.   Imperial currently owns about a third of its 4,000outlets, with the remainder being operated under contracts oftwo to five years in length. A company spokesman said some ofthe closings will affect corporate-owned outlets, while otherretailers won't have their contracts renewed.   The majority of the job losses will come at Imperial's&quot;downstream&quot; refining and marketing operations, the companysaid. About 1,000 positions will be eliminated at Imperial'sproducts division, while its &quot;upstream&quot; exploration andproduction staffing will face 400 job losses.   The cuts come only days after rival Petro-Canada announcedplans to sell a third of its retail gas stations and mothballor convert two of its five refineries.   Petro-Canada's decision, made in the wake of a string oflosses on its refining and marketing operations, marked formany investors the first glimmer of hope for the industry inmore than a year. Demand in Canada for refined products fellbetween 7% and 8% in 1991, industry sources estimate, as therecession continued. Little upturn in demand is expected thisyear, with refiners and marketers counting on slashing outputto produce more acceptable results.   &quot;Eventually, we'll see an announcement about the closureof&quot; some of Imperial's refining capacity, said Jim Doak, ananalyst with First Marathon, a Toronto investment dealer.   While Imperial held off from announcing any refineryclosings, it said the future appears bleak for at least twofacilities. The company's 85,000-barrel refinery inDartmouth, Nova Scotia, has been one of the industry's worstperformers, Imperial said, while its facility in Ioco,British Columbia, could be hit hard by environmentalregulations.   Imperial officials also noted the poor performance of itsoldest refinery, the 123,000-barrel facility in Sarnia,Ontario. A company spokesman said employees will be givenabout a year to improve the refinery's financial performance.After that, Imperial will decide whether to close therefinery, contract out its capacity, or sell it. Mr. Haynessaid the company does plan to reduce its refining capacity inOntario.   Company officials said Imperial doesn't have any estimatesof the cost of the layoffs and gasoline station closings. Butthey said the company could save 100 million Canadian dollars(US$84.7 million) annually in general and administrativeexpenses as a result of the cuts.   Imperial was quoted at $35.375, up 25 cents, in lateAmerican Stock Exchange composite trading. Exxon was up 37.5cents to $59.50 in late New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.</TEXT></DOC>
