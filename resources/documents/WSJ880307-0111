The sign is a reminder that Hei Ling Chau is no tourist stop but the home of three prisons. Ironically, it's also one of the sites where Vietnamese who took to leaky rafts and uncertain fishing vessels in search of a better life are now detained.    Surrounded by a tall wire fence, some 2,873 Vietnamese -- from the North only -- live in cold white and gray barracks that will be converted into a minimum-security prison once these people are gone. Vietnamese refugees first started arriving in Hong Kong in May 1975, the year Saigon fell to the invading northern communists. For the first five years, they were mainly southerners escaping the newly established regime; in the last eight years, however, more and more northerners, who don't so easily stir the pity of the West, have been arriving, along with others who have come via China. Wherever they set off from, they're all considered a burden by the British administration in Hong Kong.    Today, the refugees are back on the front pages after the British government recently revealed that the Orderly Departure Program from Vietnam is in progress again, after a slowdown caused by a break in discussions between Vietnam and the resettlement countries. The upshot is that more will go to Britain directly from Vietnam, while the British quota from their own colony remains at 468 over the two years beginning last May. That development has Hong Kong legislators crying foul, as the gap between those arriving and those being resettled from Hong Kong grows monthly. Some Vietnamese have been stuck here in limbo for as long as seven years. Hong Kong officials are responding to the crisis by attempting to narrow the definition of refugee to exclude those coming from China and trying to categorize others as &quot;economic migrants.&quot;    &quot;Most of those who arrive in Hong Kong now have a weak claim to refugee status under the 1951 {United Nations} convention in that they are not fleeing persecution,&quot; says the principal assistant secretary for security in Hong Kong, Nigel French. &quot;They are increasingly people who are leaving Vietnam for economic reasons.&quot;    The official U.N. definition of a refugee is one who is forced to leave his country out of well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Apparently wanting to fill an empty stomach does not count. But life in Hei Ling Chau is certainly no capitalist's paradise. Men, women and children are crammed into barracks painted institution-yellow inside and sleep two to a four-by-six-foot bunk, arranged in triple tiers. The only concessions to privacy are the rag dividers sewn around each bunk.    In 1982, to deter refugees coming to Hong Kong, the government introduced closed centers, which means inhabitants aren't allowed to work outside the camp or mingle with the Hong Kong community. Boredom is endemic. Nguyen Van Hoan, 34, has been on Hei Ling Chau with his wife for five years. They have two children, one of whom -- three-year-old Hong Cong -- was born here.    &quot;Life in the camp is difficult and crowded,&quot; he says through an interpreter. &quot;There is no means to get to another country and it's boring.&quot;    The camp does offer school for the children; language classes, cleaning, cooking and maintenance jobs for the adults (which pay about $15 per month); and workshops for the lucky 900 who are selected for light-industry programs. Hong Kong manufacturers place orders for goods such as shoes, embroidery, knitted wares, simply assembled plastic products and solder. Unfortunately, there are more people wanting in on these projects than there are jobs. But at a time when Hong Kong has an unemployment rate of less than two percent, and many factory owners are complaining about not being able to fill positions, the logic of the closed-camp policy is arguable, and becoming something of a scandal. &quot;I always feel that we should do more for the Vietnamese refugees,&quot; says Legislative Councilor Martin Lee. &quot;After all, in 10 years' time, we may find ourselves in that little boat.&quot;    Mr. French says closed camps are the only humane deterrent available to the government to discourage the Vietnamese from taking to the seas. At one stage over 70,000 refugees were awaiting resettlement in Hong Kong alone. But the number of boat people still leaving Vietnam suggests that Hong Kong's policy has only led refugees to land somewhere else. To be fair, the colony continues to accept all boat people, detaining them in one of the territory's three closed refugee camps -- with a fourth soon to open -- pending resettlement. In the longer term, the government believes that the answer lies in the screening and repatriation to Vietnam of those categorized &quot;non-refugees&quot; -- e.g., those who come via China or those who are deemed to have come for &quot;economic&quot; reasons.    Repatriation is constantly under negotiation, and Hong Kong authorities hope to implement it as soon as possible. Although the means of deciding who is and who is not a refugee is still hazy, what is even more clouded is how the authorities here will ensure that those repatriated won't be punished. Mr. French says the policy depends on guarantees from Vietnamese officials that returnees will not be persecuted, ill-treated or &quot;punished unduly&quot; -- &quot;not thrown into jail for ages, shot or whatever,&quot; he says.    Repatriation wouldn't be necessary if countries were still accepting Vietnamese refugees at the same rates as in the late 1970s and early '80s. Today only the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and Hong Kong have ongoing resettlement programs from here. Asia in particular has an abysmal record of opening its doors to refugees as permanent residents. Since the Vietnamese first started arriving after the communist takeover, only Australia has accepted any significant number from Hong Kong, and that a relatively small 6,061. Japan, the great economic power of the region, has taken 246 -- considerably less than the 621 Hong Kong itself has allowed to stay. China for its part has accepted a mere 37 settlers from Hong Kong, a figure that does not include the Vietnamese of Chinese ethnic origin who left Vietnam for China in the hope of arriving here. These people are stubbornly referred to by Hong Kong bureaucrats as &quot;illegal immigrants,&quot; not refugees, and are quickly -- and quietly -- sent back to China. Their story is not so easily told; the government refuses access to the transit camps where these people await forced repatriation.    Meanwhile, life in the camps drags on. The people who were once victims of a protracted and grisly war are now victims of a bureaucratic battle over who will bear the &quot;burden&quot; of their arrival. As for the refugees themselves, Mr. Nguyen speaks for all when he says that even had he known what awaited him before he left Vietnam five years ago, he would still have come. &quot;There's no freedom in Vietnam,&quot; says Mr. Nguyen. &quot;I want to live in a free country. I will go anywhere.&quot;    ---   Ms. Williamson is The Asian Wall Street Journal's arts editor. </TEXT></DOC>
