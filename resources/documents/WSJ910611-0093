That's a contentious question on Wall Street, where agrowing number of electronic pipelines are striving to be thefinancial industry's main information utility.</LP><TEXT>   As these high-tech middlemen stake out turf on the desksof hundreds of institutional investors, the big brokers arefinding themselves on the defensive in the fight to controlwho gets what information, in what form and when.   In April, for instance, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which runsthe largest and most expensive stock-research shop on WallStreet, hung up on First Call Corp., the leading network forzapping research reports from brokers to institutionalcustomers.   At issue, executives at the two firms say, was FirstCall's insistence that Merrill either give it exclusiverights to distribute Merrill's research, or pay $25,000 amonth -- about three times Merrill's then-current rate -- forpermission to distribute through other vendors, too.   First Call, a unit of Thompson Corp.'s Thompson FinancialNetworks, says it instituted the two-tier fee structurebecause &quot;if someone decides that First Call is the best&quot;vehicle for delivering research, &quot;we want to reward thatguy,&quot; says general manager Bruce Fador.   Merrill, which was among the last and most reluctant ofthe 27 brokers to join First Call's system, took a differentview. &quot;It didn't make sense to not have control of ourproduct or pay a lot more money&quot; to First Call, so &quot;westopped transmitting our information to them,&quot; says JeffersonHughes, managing director of global equity sales at Merrill.   The Merrill-First Call dispute is only the latest episodein the broader struggle among brokerage firms to defend theso-called intellectual property they create -- includingeverything from fundamental research to earnings forecasts,securities prices and other data. &quot;The main underlying issueis the control of information and knowledge -- and how youget paid for that,&quot; says Merrill's Mr. Hughes.   Proliferating data networks make it harder than ever forbrokers to control the information flow. First Call, in whichMerrill and nine other Wall Street firms share a 48% stake,dominates in delivering real-time stock research, but othervendors are quickly diversifying into that business.   For example, Bloomberg Financial Markets, a rivalfinancial information vendor that is 30%-owned by Merrill, isaggressively muscling in on First Call's turf -- offeringMerrill customers free service for an indeterminate period,in a gamble that they'll opt to stay on the Bloomberg systemfor good.   The biggest Wall Street firms also are forming individualand cooperative electronic pipelines of their own. Merrill,for instance, is unveiling its own private network forcustomers this month; Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. already has asimilar product on the market.   Goldman, First Boston Corp., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., SalomonInc., American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.and Citicorp's Citibank are joining forces in an ambitiousnew electronic joint venture called EJV Partners, which alsointends eventually to compete in stock research.   In the old days, Wall Street research was a more exclusiveaffair, and institutions had a greater need to keep closetrading ties with brokers to stay informed. Whenever a brokerunearthed a new investment insight, it was the customers whogenerated the most commission revenue who were assured of the&quot;first call.&quot;   Today, with instantaneous communications, computerizedinformation services and automated trading systems, researchdoesn't stay proprietary for very long. That means not onlythat it's harder and more expensive to stay ahead in the WallStreet research game, but also that the resulting producttends to be a more perishable, less lucrative commodity.   The control issue is a particularly touchy one at bigfirms such as Merrill or Goldman Sachs, whose researchbudgets can run $50 million to $80 million a year. Thesefirms believe it cheapens their product to have itintermingled with competitors' work and displayed in astandardized way by the data networks.   &quot;The problem is that First Call isn't really a `firstcall' at all -- it's an `all call.' It's really a broadcastsystem,&quot; says Frederick Litt, a Goldman vice president whocoordinates the firm's electronic-research services. &quot;It's ademocratizer of information.&quot;   The vendors themselves acknowledge that their presence inthe market tends to depress the value of research by makingit more widely available on an equal-time basis.   &quot;First Call has certainly created an efficiency in themarket, and somebody probably is making less money as aresult,&quot; says First Call's Mr. Fador. &quot;We put this stuff outon the system and the little guy at Dubuque CapitalManagement gets it the same time as a big player likeFidelity -- we are an equalizer in that sense,&quot; he says.   The vendors have important allies. They tend to besupported by institutions, which like getting the mostresearch in the timeliest, most user-friendly package for theleast amount of money. The vendors also are natural allies ofsmaller Wall Street brokers and regional firms, which derivean advantage in having their research lumped in with the bigguys' on the same network.   &quot;Smaller guys have the ability with First Call todistribute {research} more widely with a smaller salesforce,&quot; says Mr. Fador. &quot;The institution that's never takenthe salesman's phone call before sees the analyst's opinionup on the screen next to Morgan Stanley and Goldman andMerrill, so maybe he takes the call.&quot;   In the long run, continuing advances in technologyprobably will decide who comes out on top. Already, some biginstitutions, such as Fidelity Investments, are developingin-house computer networks that can receive researchelectronically from many different sources and massage itthemselves.   Many experts believe that such developments will relegatethe high-tech middlemen to a marginal role.   &quot;The do-it-yourself world, where you're only taking feedsdirect {from brokers}, does give brokers better control overpricing and dissemination&quot; because it allows them to tierwhat they send to different customers, says a Shearsonexecutive. In other words, the wave of the future may be anelectronic return to the old-style first call.   Meanwhile, Merrill and First Call are still talking, inhopes of resolving their dispute. While the rift has leftFirst Call exposed to encroachments by other vendors who dotransmit Merrill's research, it has been something of aPyrrhic victory for Merrill, as well. &quot;We got a lot of heatfrom our clients for the inconvenience,&quot; says Merrill's Mr.Hughes.</TEXT></DOC>
