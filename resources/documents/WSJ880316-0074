A lot of people here are very sensitive about this. So that might explain the excitement that has greeted the recent arrival of a new import from America -- alligator.    Louisiana farm-bred alligator, both fresh and freeze-packed, hit these shores back in November, and from what you read here these days, you'd think it was the only thing chic Britons were eating. It's sold in all the right restaurants, and do-it-yourself enthusiasts can pick it up at Harrods for a little under $12 a pound. There's also a slew of recipes available all of a sudden, from Alligator Primavera to that old Cajun favorite, Szechuan Spicy Alligator.    Part of the fuss is no doubt due to the local press, which clearly loves dreaming up headlines for alligator stories. &quot;Eat Up Your Dinner Before It Eats You!&quot; went the London Evening Standard's contribution, though the ever-staid Times could muster only &quot;Alligator Is Proving a Popular Purchase.&quot;    Alligator also has proved to be a big television hit. Several food shows have discussed its snappier qualities (high in protein, low in fat), and there have been the inevitable tastings. Most memorable was a late-night program filmed in London's Trafalgar Square. A Cajun chef -- and for some odd reason, singer Donny Osmond (maybe it was the teeth) -- was on hand to dispense gator morsels to willing Brits. Unfortunately, there wasn't any gator available that night, and pork, which looks a lot like the Real Thing, was substituted silently. That didn't daunt the tasters. Many of them quickly spat out the stuff, pronouncing it too fishy, too scaly and too swampy for human consumption.    &quot;That's the pressure of thinking,&quot; chuckled Jim Moran, the 28-year-old fishmonger who introduced alligator to his compatriots. Known to his colleagues these days as &quot;Crocodile Dundee,&quot; Mr. Moran, a third-generation wholesale fish dealer, is cautiously bullish about alligator's potential here. He currently sells between 900 and 1,200 pounds of prime gator a week, up from an initial 700-pound shipment, which took three weeks to unload. That's not exactly killer competition for Dover sole or plaice, the classic staples of the British fish industry, but it's certainly a start.    &quot;We're selling mainly to restaurants so far,&quot; Mr. Moran noted during a chat in his company's long, narrow office overlooking the vast Billingsgate Wholesale Fish Market, where the family firm, R.W. Larkins andamp; Co. Ltd., has had a stall for more than 100 years. &quot;I'd like to see it sold in pubs to give it a general recognition,&quot; he added fondly. &quot;Once we get that, it won't be long before you see R.W. Larkins alligator wallets.&quot;    People here are eating alligator -- or more accurately, have the opportunity to eat alligator -- for several reasons. Most notable is the weak dollar. Though a handful of Billingsgate's 67 wholesale fish dealers have sold international seafood imports for several years, fresh air-shipped American fish was rarely on the menu until the dollar dipped so dramatically last fall.    Most American goods, including foods, are heavily taxed here -- there's a 15% duty on alligator and a whopping 22% on tuna, as opposed to nothing on fish from such places as the Seychelles, for example. According to Mr. Moran, that means he can afford to import from America as long as the exchange rate dips no lower than $1.50 to the British pound sterling. (Gator fans can breathe easy as the rate has been hovering around $1.80.)    Americans also are actively peddling their fish these days, again due to the dollar's drop. Mr. Moran, whose company is currently the only one in the land handling alligator, first heard about the stuff at the Third Annual Louisiana Seafood Conference in New Orleans last September. Invited to address the group on the British seafood market, he wound up sampling alligator, along with a medley of more familiar local seafoods, including crawfish, catfish, parrot fish, turtle and dolphinfish (better known as mahi-mahi).    &quot;I thought it was passable,&quot; he said of the alligator. &quot;I thought I could put it in restaurants as a sort of fad thing and that it would get a lot of publicity that might attract people to other exotic seafood.&quot; The new, albeit embryonic, popularity of Cajun restaurants here (you can still count them all on two hands) seemed another little plus for alligator.    And as everyone vaguely related to the food industry here eagerly tells you, Britons are eating more healthily -- and more imaginatively -- largely because they've been traveling more and have had new foods forced upon them.    &quot;I don't think alligator would have had a hope in hell 10 years ago,&quot; said Antony Manzi, director of Manzi's, one of London's oldest fish restaurants. These days Manzi's offers alligator meuniere, cooked in butter and lemon juice, and alligator beurre noir, with capers and spices. &quot;Those recipes just sprung to mind when we tasted it,&quot; said Mr. Manzi, adding that his staunch English clientele wouldn't have wanted anything more outlandish. &quot;Order the meuniere,&quot; the waiter cautioned when we went to sample London's smartest food. Both styles were, in fact, quite &quot;passable&quot; -- light, tasty and easy to digest though a bit chewy.    The big question now is whether gator's got staying power. A few places that had it briefly on the menu already have discontinued it, though Manzi's bravely forges on. &quot;People do come back and eat it again,&quot; said Mr. Manzi.    As for Jim Moran, he's eager to sell gator on the Continent. He also thinks catfish, properly marketed, has a rosy future here. But the possibilities are endless, he insisted, adjusting the brim of his &quot;Gator from the 'Gate&quot; baseball cap. &quot;At the moment we're considering crocodile from the Philippines.&quot;    ---   Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer based in London. </TEXT></DOC>
