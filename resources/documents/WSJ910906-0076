The wrangling represents further fallout from the largestweapons cancellation in U.S. history and threatens tocomplicate a matter that already promises to be tied up inthe courts for years.</LP><TEXT>   In the balance hangs hundreds of millions, if notbillions, of dollars that subcontractors across the nationinvested in the manufacture of A-12 parts, people close tothe situation say. Industry officials say a number ofsuppliers, including Sundstrand Corp. of Rockford, Ill., arethinking of formally allying themselves to fight the primecontractors.   At the heart of the subcontractors' concerns is a feelingthat the lead contractors are treating their hundreds ofsuppliers differently from the way they themselves areseeking to be treated by the courts.   Where the subcontractors are being told to expectrecoveries equal only to the value of their fixed-priceagreements -- if even that much -- McDonnell Douglas andGeneral Dynamics are looking to recoup all of their expenseson the project, including all cost overruns and additionalinvestments they made.   During recent defense industry meetings, subcontractorshave expressed a belief that &quot;a dual standard is beingemployed by the primes,&quot; said Donald Sovie, a partner withthe Newport Beach, Calif., office of Crowell andamp; Moring, a lawfirm that represents several A-12 suppliers.   Most of the sparring is taking place between the primesand the larger subcontractors -- those with $1 million ormore at stake. Meantime, both McDonnell Douglas and GeneralDynamics say they've settled with hundreds of smallersuppliers. Presumably, these companies didn't sink much, ifany, money into original development work and could markettheir standardized equipment elsewhere.   A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas said thecompany has just begun to review many of the largersubcontractors' settlement proposals and will address them&quot;under the applicable state law and contract provisions.&quot;General Dynamics, also in St. Louis, said in a statement thatit believes that it has terminated its subcontractingagreements in a &quot;fair and appropriate&quot; manner, and that itexpects to settle those cases still outstanding &quot;in promptand fair fashion.&quot;   The A-12 was developed during the 1980s as the nation'snext-generation carrier-based attack plane. It was envisionedas a $52 billion program involving a fleet of at least 620planes. But eight months ago, Defense Secretary Dick Cheneykilled it, accusing McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics ofdefaulting on their pact with the Navy. In turn, McDonnellDouglas and General Dynamics terminated the pacts they hadwith their subcontractors.   But now, the two companies are arguing in court that theirown fixed-price arrangement with the Navy was invalid -- andtherefore should be changed to a cost-reimbursement type ofcontract. In their complaint, filed last June in U.S. ClaimsCourt in Washington, the companies say they're even entitledto receive &quot;a reasonable profit.&quot;   For their part, the subcontractors want the same deal.But, according to several industry lawyers and contractingofficers, they're being told to expect much more restrictivesettlements. In fact, in cases where subcontractors expectedto encounter a cost overrun, they're being told that a &quot;lossformula&quot; will be applied, limiting their recoveries all themore.   That especially irks suppliers that signed contracts theyknew they would overrun, but were told by General Dynamicsand McDonnell Douglas that they would be able to more thanmake up for it during production. &quot;It was known thesubcontractors were investing&quot; in this way, said PaulKearney, director of contracting at Allied-Signal Inc.'saerospace unit in Torrance, Calif.   He added that McDonnell Douglas seems more open thanGeneral Dynamics to the idea of at least deferring finalresolution of the subcontractors' claims until the primecontractors' own court case is finished. But, he said, evenMcDonnell Douglas at this point is &quot;unwilling to settlebeyond the perceived limits&quot; of the subcontractors'fixed-price terms.   &quot;The ax is falling one way -- on the subcontractors,&quot;asserted Bob Brunette, co-counsel for the ProprietaryIndustries Association, a group of subcontractors that a fewweeks ago held a seminar on contract terminations, duringwhich the A-12 situation was widely discussed.   For all concerned, the issue remains sensitive. A numberof prominent A-12 suppliers, including Honeywell Inc. andGeneral Electric Co., said they're in the midst of preparingtheir settlement proposals and couldn't comment. TeledyneInc. and Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s Baltimore-baseddefense operations declined to comment completely.   &quot;As you can imagine, we're suppliers to both McDonnellDouglas and General Dynamics on a vast array of projects,&quot;said Mr. Kearney of Allied-Signal. &quot;So we're approachingthings somewhat gingerly&quot; on the A-12. Still, he said, &quot;We'renot interested in giving up our rights.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
