BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A marathon bargaining session led to an agreementin principle between AMR Corp. and the Transport Workers Union on anew contract, averting a threatened strike at American Airlines,the nation's largest carrier.   Neither side released details of the pact Tuesday, except abrief company statement that said union and management officialsbelieve ``the agreement benefits both the company and the union andwill enable American to continue the growth plan that has made theairline an industry leader.''   The statement by Fort Worth-based AMR said the agreement wasreached after a 27-hour bargaining session. Details were withheldpending ``agreement on final language and ratification.''   The airline and union, which represents about 23,000 of thecompany's 67,000 employees, submitted to mediation after American'sproposed $610 million four-year contract was rejected in March.   The rejected contract guaranteed raises for all employees,ranging from about 28 percent over four years to about 100 percentduring the contract. However, the union objected to American'stwo-tier wage scale, under which it takes new employees 12 years toreach top pay. The union wanted that reduced to five years.   In addition, there were complaints that even with the increases,American mechanics and ground service employees would not be theindustry's highest-paid.   Also at issue was the company's plan to have employees pay $10per person _ and up to $30 per family _ toward health insuranceeach month. The company now pays the entire premium.   The mediation continued daily from its April 14 beginning untilFriday, when the parties took a two-day break before resumingSunday, said Ed Koziatek, the TWU's international vice presidentfor American.   Airline officials have complained that the contract sufferedfrom union politics as several locals were conducting electioncampaigns while the pact was up for ratification in March.   The four-year pact became amendable on March 1, but was rejected12,143-to-5,140. However under the federal Railway Labor Act,transportation contracts do not expire until after a lengthyprocess that involves mediation, followed by a 30-day cooling-offperiod should the mediator declare an impasse in the negotiations.   The TWU represents the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, groundcrews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.   American had its most profitable year ever last year, with thoseprofits sustained through the first three months of this year.   AMR posted 1988 net income of $476.8 million, a 140.3 percentincrease from 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous recordof $345.8 million in 1985.   The company reported a first-quarter profit of $101 million, a47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months. Operatingrevenues were $2.45 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
