Outside law firms have been retained to investigate recentproblems at Salomon Brothers Inc., Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational and American Express Co. And as the governmentsteps up its probe of the Treasury market, brokerage firmsand commercial banks with big Treasury operations areordering up their own probes.</LP><TEXT>   Though a bonanza for law firms, the recent spate ofinternal investigations has rekindled old concerns over theirlegitimacy. Because companies typically retain their regularoutside firms for the task, critics have long claimed thatobjectivity is easily compromised. The internal reports thatresult from the probes, say the critics, are too oftenpublic-relations whitewashes that protect upper management.   &quot;To be of significance, the investigation must be totallyindependent, but how that can be accomplished is a mysteryencased in an enigma surrounded by a shroud,&quot; says DavidBerger, a Philadelphia attorney who represents shareholders.   &quot;It's a very delicate situation to say the least,&quot; saysJohn Curtin, a Boston attorney and the former president ofthe American Bar Association. &quot;The law firm, in representingthe interests of the corporation, has the duty to disclose{wrongdoing} even if it involves the executive who brings thelawyer in.&quot;   The law firm is indeed in a sensitive position. If agovernment probe later reveals malfeasance that a lawyer'sprobe did not, the firm has jeopardized its reputation. Yet,a hard-hitting report implicating top officials could bebranded as overzealous by the corporation, and the law firmcould lose a high-paying client.   One of the thorniest of all conflicts concernstransactions in which the investigating law firm, wearing itsother hat as the company's outside counsel, previouslyprovided advice. If the firm withholds information about anallegedly illicit transaction that is later exposed, it couldbe held civilly liable by the company or by shareholders. Andalthough the law firm has no obligation to reveal such adiscovery to the government, it could be held criminallyliable for aiding and abetting its client if the company werelater prosecuted.   The resignation two weeks ago of the top-drawer law firmWachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz from its representation ofSalomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit, a Wachtell client for20 years, shows how problematic internal probes can be. Justafter receiving government subpoenas for documents related toits huge Treasury bond operations in July, Salomon askedWachtell lawyers to conduct an internal investigation. Butthe law firm later came under fire because it knew aboutevidence of illegal Treasury-note bids but was slow to revealthe problems to regulators.   Wachtell offered more than once to resign, as previouslyreported, after Warren Buffett became Salomon's interimchairman. But the offers were rejected partly becauseWachtell, with its in-depth knowledge of a long-time client,was the best equipped to do the type of quick and thoroughprobe Salomon wanted.   Lawyers who have conducted internal probes say the work,though lucrative, is extremely stressful. This is not onlybecause of potential conflicts but also because of the needfor speed and thoroughness. When top officials receive grandjury subpoenas or shareholders call for an executive'sdismissal, companies are anxious to get rid of the problem assoon as possible.   &quot;When there's blood in the water, the sharks gather andyour job is to find the source and stop the bleeding as soonas possible,&quot; says one attorney who requested anonymitybecause of his current involvement in an internal probe.   Companies are quick to hire lawyers to stem the flow,rather than accountants, for several reasons. A lawyer'sreport is usually protected by attorney-client privilege,which means the company can benefit from the informationwhile concealing parts of it from the government or fromplaintiffs' attorneys. As previously reported, governmentlawyers were apparently fuming last month when it becameclear that the internal report prepared for Salomon byWachtell went beyond what Wachtell initially disclosed to thegovernment.   Also, an internal report giving a clean bill of healthfrom a respectable law firm carries considerable weight in acourtroom. Countless shareholder-derivative suits brought onbehalf of a company against directors or officers bite thedust each year because of such reports. The company's boardcan argue that the report proves it investigated the chargesoutlined in a shareholder suit and that the investigationdispelled all fears of potential wrongdoing.   Internal reports have been particularly useful in recentyears, say lawyers, as the government, in its enforcement ofsecurities regulations, has increasingly pointed a finger atsupervisors, claiming they should have stopped allegedwrongdoing. If the company can show that its supervisors werevigilant but nonetheless unaware of wrongdoing, then thepotential liability shifts to lower level workers.   But controversy sometimes follows in the wake of suchreports. Last November, BCCI's outside counsel in Florida,Holland andamp; Knight, and private investigators Philip ManuelAssociates, completed a report that blamed a former seniorofficer for alleged transgressions committed by BCCI'sFlorida offices. The officer, who is cooperating withgovernment investigations into BCCI, claims the bank used thereport to make him the scapegoat and take the heat off ofcurrent top officials. BCCI is a unit of BCCI Holdings(Luxembourg) S.A.   Holland andamp; Knight attorneys did not return calls forcomments.   Among other recent examples, the American Express boardordered a probe after shareholders sued regarding an $8million settlement with banker Edmond Safra. Shareholdersaccused top officials of not properly supervising lower levelstaff in a campaign to spread false rumors about Mr. Safra.The report concluded there were no grounds for lawsuitsagainst officers or directors.</TEXT></DOC>
