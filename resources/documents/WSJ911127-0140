Trade Representative Carla Hills said the U.S. made &quot;everyeffort&quot; to settle the dispute, but that China failed toprovide an adequate response before the statutory deadlinefor doing so expired yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. will publish in the Federal Register today a listof Chinese products that may be subject to these punitivetariffs. U.S. officials said the retaliation would have to be&quot;commensurate&quot; with the estimated losses to U.S. businessescaused by the alleged patent and copyright violations. Thus,the tariffs on Chinese imports could amount to between $300million and $400 million a year.   The U.S. has charged that China doesn't adequately protectU.S. patents for chemical and pharmaceutical products, andlacks such protection for U.S. computer software, trademarksand trade secrets.   U.S. trade officials will hear public comments on thechoice of products to be subject to these tariffs, whilecontinuing to negotiate with Beijing. If no settlement isreached by late December, the tariffs will be imposed on theselected products.   At the same time, Mrs. Hills extended the deadline forsettling a similar U.S. complaint against India. She saidthat some progress has been made in negotiations with NewDelhi. The U.S. complaint against India also involves thetreatment of patents, trademarks and trade secrets, but thenew Indian government has shown some willingness to revampits patent laws.   The list of Chinese products possibly subject to the newtariffs wasn't available yesterday. In such cases in thepast, the U.S. has imposed tariffs that would cause the leastharm on U.S. consumers or industrial users.   The Bush administration is applying pressure on China onseveral fronts in an effort to stave off congressional movesto strip China of its normal trading benefits in the U.S.Last month, Mrs. Hills initiated an investigation of allegedChinese barriers to U.S. imports. If Beijing doesn't delivercertain regulatory changes by next October, the U.S. couldimpose retaliatory tariffs on an additional set of Chineseproducts.   To satisfy the U.S. complaint on intellectual-propertyprotection, China will have to make specific commitmentswithin a month to revise its patent laws, including providingprotection for new U.S. drugs that are still being tested,and cracking down on the alleged piracy of U.S.-designedsoftware. Even though Beijing is aware of the importance ofU.S. good will, the Chinese bureaucracy appears too large andcumbersome to respond quickly.   The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't respond to callsabout the U.S. action.</TEXT></DOC>
