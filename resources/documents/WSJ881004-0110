At the same time the region has become a mecca for developers, its rate of population and job growth has slowed, leaving some markets severely overbuilt. Such Sun Belt hot-spots as Atlanta, Nashville and Palm Beach County, Fla. are all struggling. In the latter, the office vacancy rate has hit 32% and single-family housing permits are forecast to drop 17% this year.    Palm Beach County is just one example of the broad retrenchment now under way in the Southeast. After five straight years of growth, in a five-state portion of the region, the value of new construction contracts fell 1.5% in the first eight months of 1988, according to the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc.    The question now is: have developers and lenders pulled in their horns sufficiently and soon enough to avert a real estate debacle? &quot;The slowdown could be pretty bad to very bad,&quot; says R. Thomas Powers, director of economic research for Goodkin Research Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.    In some respects, the slowdown could really be a healthy correction. It will shake out marginal developers, save the region's economy from a more radical overheating and, in some cases, possibly improve the quality of life. For instance, the drop in Palm Beach County housing permits was partly due to new development restrictions, to ease traffic congestion.    But a slowdown in growth rates remains at the heart of the real estate problem. Florida, which saw population gains of 384,000 in 1986 and 391,000 in 1987 will slow to a 360,000 gain this year and 320,000 in 1989, Goodkin forecasts. Much of the earlier influx came from people fleeing depressed conditions elsewhere in the country. But with a new burnish on the Rust Belt, that migration has slowed and in some cases reversed.    That means fewer jobs created. The Tampa Bay area, which had a 5% job-growth rate from mid-1986 to mid-1987, saw that pace cut in half during the following 12 months, according to Carlen Maddux, whose Maddux Report follows real estate in that area. But buildings were still being constructed on the old assumptions. The result, according to Mr. Maddux: It will take an estimated five years to absorb the office space now on the market in Pinellas County, across the bay from Tampa where St. Petersburg is located.    The South's boomtowns are also mainly service centers, and the service economy is taking a back seat to manufacturing in this part of the economic cycle. In metropolitan Atlanta, employment in business services -- companies that provide services to other companies -- which grew at a 25% clip in the mid-1980s, will drop to about 6% this year, according to Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center.    Overall, metropolitan Atlanta will generate about 21,700 new jobs this year, less than half last year's total and about 20% of its 1984 peak. At that time, Mr. Ratajczak believes, the city was benefiting from the restructuring of southern manufacturers. Those firms were lopping in-house staff functions and contracting out for them in the South's business capital, Atlanta. &quot;It was really a one-time spurt, but no one recognized it, especially the developers,&quot; he says.    Meantime, the comeback of manufacturing means fewer people are migrating from the South's milltowns to Atlanta, as they had been. &quot;A lot of people used to commute from Alabama and build office towers here,&quot; says Wayne D. Gantt, an economist with SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta. &quot;Now, there may be a plant back there that makes chips for the Japanese, and they're going to stay home.&quot;    Still, the office towers continue to go up here, even as developers and lenders talk of prudence. Carter andamp; Associates, an Atlanta developer, projects that 6.8 million square feet of office space will come on the market this year, the most activity since 1985. Jerald D. Hitzemann, Carter's research director, believes the market can handle all that activity, noting that about 2.8 million square feet of new space was absorbed in the first half of the year.    But the downtown Atlanta vacancy rate has spiked up 61% since the beginning of the year, according to the Coldwell Banker brokerage concern, to 16.9% at Sept. 30. And in the overall market, space is being filled on very sweet terms for tenants. Some buildings, for instance, offer a year's free rent on 5,000 square feet. &quot;There's so much space out there you can call your own shot,&quot; says Daniel Levison, who heads Real Property Data Inc., an Atlanta real estate research firm.    Thus far, the residential real estate market has reacted more sharply to softer markets than the office builders. U.S. Housing Markets, a research subsidiary of Lomas Mortgage USA, forecasts that new single-family housing permits will be down 8% this year in Atlanta, 13% in Jacksonville, Fla., 16% in Tampa-St. Petersburg and 17% in Nashville. The latter is seen by some real estate experts as a prime example of a Southeastern market that got too big a boom-town reputation and too much development for it to handle.    &quot;I think a lot of our problems were caused by a lot of Texas {developers} who came here and said 'Nashville is going to be a hot, hot town,&quot;' says William M. Wilson, president of Cherokee Equity Corp. a Nashville concern whose interests include apartment development. At this point, however, it is definitely cool, with a downtown office vacancy rate that jumped to 20% from 18% between June 30 and Sept. 30, according to Coldwell Banker.    A number of these Southeastern office markets are better cushioned from a fall than they have been in the past, however. Atlanta, for instance, is not only a far larger, more mature market than during its mid-1970s real estate crash, but its major new office buildings have &quot;deep-pockets&quot; -- institutional investors who can withstand a storm.    Of more concern to some observers is the retail real estate market, which is fully as overbuilt and has less firm underpinnings. Small &quot;strip&quot; shopping malls are often constructed by the smaller, shakier developers and populated by the smaller, shakier retailers. They will also be hurt by the slowdown in population growth. &quot;The retail side is just now getting into the same position the offices have been,&quot; says Kroghie Andresen, senior vice president of First Union Mortgage Corp. &quot;You're going to find retail has been severely overbuilt.&quot;    ---                   Southeast Construction     Value of building starts in five Southeastern states                                Dollars        Percent                             (in billions)     Change       1982                      $18.9         -  5.0%       1983                       27.6         + 46.0       1984                       32.0         + 16.0       1985                       35.4         + 11.0       1986                       36.8         +  2.8       1987                       38.4         +  4.3       1988*                      25.4         -  1.5     * First eight months     Source: F.W.
