On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, closed 22cents higher at $17.73 a barrel after falling to $17.38 earlier inthe session. The contract had risen 48 cents on Wednesday to $17.51a barrel.   Other contract months were mixed.   According to market observers, the report published in anArabic-language newspaper said Dubai, the largest producing emiratewithin the United Arab Emirates, was willing to cut its output 10percent after March 1 if market conditions warrant.   ``It was psychological,'' said Jayne Ball, commodity oil brokerwith Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Ten percent only amounts to 40,000barrels a day. The main thing is Dubai had said (previously) itwould not cut back at all.''   World oil prices had risen rapidly since November, surprisingmany analysts, but in recent days began easing slightly mainly ontechnical factors.   Investors interpreted Thursday's news as another sign that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying to stabilizeprices, analysts said.   The United Arab Emirates is one of the OPEC countries believed tobe exceeding a new production quota established by the 13-membercartel to reduce output and stabilize world oil prices. The quota of18.5 million barrels a day took effect Jan. 1 but various estimatessince then put OPEC's actual production at between 19.5 million and20 million barrels.   Some reports have suggested the UAE is exceeding its quota bysome 400,000 barrels a day.   Traders said prices also got some support from VenezuelanPresident Carlos Andres Perez who during his inauguration onThursday called for more cooperation by OPEC and non-OPEC countries.   Among refined oil products, the March contract for unleadedgasoline lost 0.1 cent to close at 49.62 cents a gallon, while theMarch contract for heating oil rose 0.11 cent to 50.55 cents agallon.</TEXT></DOC>
