The best-performing stock-fund managers retreated to cash, spread their money among more stocks or took profits unusually quickly. Those defensive strategies allowed them to come out on top in the third quarter, 12 months and longer periods ended Sept. 30.    Take the Kaufmann Fund, whose 18.63% jump made it the quarter's best performer. It got battered last year because it held a large amount of a single speculative stock that plunged, Chantal Pharmaceutical Inc., a development-stage drug company. The fund recently increased the number of stocks it holds nearly one-third.    &quot;We made a mistake by making too substantial a position in one stock,&quot; says Lawrence Auriana, fund co-manager. &quot;We don't plan to make that mistake in the future.&quot;    Oppenheimer Management Corp.'s Ninety-Ten Fund became the 12-month leader by taking the most defensive stance, with 99% of its portfolio in cash equivalents such as Treasury bills; it's always at least 90% in cash. Even the aggressive New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund pulled in its horns, with more than 50% of its stash in cash.    And after a bumpy ride during the third quarter, many fund managers suspect the market may remain in a relatively narrow trading range. &quot;I can't see anything through the end of the year to change that,&quot; says Jon Fossel, president of Oppenheimer Management, which is owned by British andamp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC and isn't related to Oppenheimer andamp; Co. of the U.S.    Adds Mr. Fossel: &quot;My gut feel is that we'll see a soft market continuing at least through early next year.&quot;    This outlook suggests that fund managers are likely to remain wary in the months ahead, shunning the big bets some of them tended to make on individual stocks or groups in last year's bull market.    Here's a look at the leaders for four periods ended Sept. 30 and how they got there.    THIRD QUARTER   -------------------   Kaufmann Fund +18.63%   --------------------   For the second consecutive quarter, the tiny Kaufmann Fund copped the top spot among all stock funds for a three-month period. The fund, which has just $4.7 million in assets, also led all other funds for the year to date, jumping 72%.    With only 23 stocks in its portfolio, Kaufmann can be very volatile. Last year it plunged more than 37%, far more than most stock funds.    Still, Mr. Auriana and co-manager Hans Utsch seem to be on a roll at the moment. Their hottest stock: Spectramed Inc., which makes disposable catheters and was acquired by British Oxygen Corp. The fund's average cost for the issue was below $4 in last year's fourth quarter. The company was acquired for $12 a share. Another strong gainer was Trimedyne Inc., an over-the-counter issue that leapt 67% in the quarter. It has won regulatory approval to market a laser method of cleaning the arteries of limbs.    Not all the fund's stocks were winners. Chantal, which had gained 40% in the second quarter, plunged 25% for the third period. But Mr. Auriana is undaunted; he is &quot;convinced that it has a breakthrough medical compound.&quot;    The fund's cash position had risen to 15% at the quarter's end; it was fully invested in stocks three months earlier. &quot;We're looking for new opportunities,&quot; Mr. Auriana says.    TWELVE MONTHS   ------------------   Oppenheimer 90-10 Fund +37.50%   ------------------------------   Oppenheimer Ninety-Ten Fund isn't a typical stock fund, given that at least 90% of it must go into such risk-reducing &quot;cash&quot; vehicles as Treasury bills and certificates of deposit. The other 10% is allowed to go into options.    The fund, with $28.7 million in assets, snared the trailing 12 months' leadership largely on the back of the 1987 fourth quarter's spectacular 43% gain. For the 12 months through Sept. 30 the fund was up 37.5%, though the latest three months brought a minute 0.01% gain.    The recent lackluster return has stemmed from dull market action, contend co-fund managers Diane Jarmusz and Robert Doll. Ninety-Ten, with its flexibility in using options, thrives in volatile market conditions when the relatively small cost of an option can lead to a big payoff. But this year's narrow trading range has caused the managers to pull back.    Currently Ms. Jarmusz and Mr. Doll are using a rifle-shot approach. They've bought call options -- which give the fund the right to buy shares of a company's stock at a specific price until a set future date -- on only a few individual holdings they're hoping will advance: Amdahl Corp., Intel Corp., Limited Inc., Novell Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    The rest of the fund -- 99% of it -- is in cash, which cushions against market drops but can hamper performance in rising markets.    &quot;I wish I could give you all these ideas,&quot; Ms. Jarmusz says, &quot;but that's not what this year is about.&quot;    And even if market volatility picks up, the fund will remain more defensive than in the past. &quot;Even if some technical indicators were to flash a big 'go' or 'stop,' we probably would be a little more moderate across the board,&quot; says Mr. Fossel, Oppenheimer president.    FIVE YEARS   ------------------------------------------   New England Zenith Capital Growth +379.73%   ------------------------------------------   The $39 million New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund captured the top five-year spot, displacing the Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund. Not that the fund shone in the latest quarter, which had a 1% drop. It's just that the fund now has been around for a full five years.    Fund manager G. Kenneth Heebner has one of the best reputations in the fund business. He continues to manage the fund aggressively. Its annual portfolio turnover, for instance, is 200%-400%.    The recent stumble stems from a flat market, says Mr. Heebner, who currently keeps 50% to 60% of the fund in cash equivalents. His defensive posture is triggered by concern that the current economic expansion will end through some combination of fiscal and monetary constraints.    His response: buying shares of inflation-sensitive diamond companies. Since the crash, diamond sales have picked up, he says, so he has bought Kay Jewelers Inc. and Tiffany andamp; Co., among others. Kay has benefited from the strength in diamond sales and Tiffany is expanding world-wide, he says. &quot;The bad news is inflation,&quot; he adds. The good news is that these companies should do well if inflation picks up, as he expects it will.    The fund's value also has been bolstered by gains in Nike Inc. and UAL Inc., whose United Airlines unit got a boost from falling oil prices.    TEN YEARS   --------------------------------   FIDELITY MAGELLAN FUND +1,105.69%   ---------------------------------   Another fan of United and of airline stocks in general is Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity Magellan Fund. The $9 billion fund again occupied the top 10-year spot. And despite a flat third quarter, it shows no sign of giving that spot up any time soon.    Besides United, Mr. Lynch's recent buys include American Airlines parent AMR Corp., Delta Air Lines, USAir Group and Southwest Airlines. The airline industry &quot;has really tightened up&quot; and is backed by solid fundamentals, even if crude oil prices rebound $2 or $3 a barrel, Mr. Lynch says. The recent oil-price slide is &quot;all frosting&quot; on his airline outlook.    Some other recent buys: aluminum issues such as Reynolds Metals Co., Amax Inc. and Aluminum Co. of America; tobacco issues such as Philip Morris Cos., RJR Nabisco Inc. and Loews Corp.; and energy issues such as Amoco Corp., Mobil Corp. and Shell Transport andamp; Trading Co., among others. Mr. Lynch says the energy issues, which have been buffered from the oil-price drop by strong chemical businesses, are &quot;really building up their balance sheets.&quot;    At the same time, he's lightened up on some of his secondary holdings, such as telephone utilities, including Nynex Corp., Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp.    It's difficult to argue that Magellan, which is usually close to fully invested in stocks, is getting very defensive. But Mr. Lynch does try to jump nimbly away from a stock once he perceives that it is appropriately valued by the market.    When a stock reaches that level and is fairly priced, Mr. Lynch says, he quickly switches into other issues that he sees as undervalued by the market.    &quot;You've got to get out when the story is still pretty good,&quot; he says.    ---                Equity Fund Winners and Losers Performance for periods ended Sept. 30; assets as of June 30    Third Quarter                                           PERFORMANCE                            ASSETS     -------------------- FUND NAME             (In millions)   3rd QTR.      5 YEAR Top Five Kaufmann Fund              $  2.7       18.6%        N.A.
