The testimony of Heinrich Brandtjen, a federal policeinvestigator from West Germany, contradicted Hamadi's statementslast week that he was not a member of the radical Hezbollah group.   Brandtjen's testimony came after Hamadi, charged with murder andair piracy in the hijacking that left an American Navy diver dead,declared that he hates the United States.   A prosecution witness who said she met Hamadi in West Germanythe month before the June 1985 hijacking broke into tears and saidsomeone threatened her to keep her from saying she recognized thedefendant.   After his older brother, Abbas, refused to testify at the startof today's proceedings, Hamadi read from a statement he startedTuesday.   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger interrupted him, asking: ``Doyou hate the U.S.A.?''   ``I grew up in Lebanon in the middle of the war, and onenaturally asks himself _ why? The answer was always America, orIsrael with support of America,'' the Shiite Moslem responded.   Again the chief judge asked him: ``Do you hate America?''   ``I have hateful feelings for all that attacked us, not just forthe U.S.A. alone,'' Hamadi said through an interpreter.   ``I only hear America, America, America. America kills, Americadestroys,'' he said.   The chief judge asked him: ``Do you find attacks and hijackingsagainst the U.S.A. justified?''   ``I'm not convinced that all forms of fighting are correct.'' Hecited an admonition in the Koran, Islam's holy book, to ``fightthose who fight you, but don't attack those that don't attack you.''   The jetliner was hijacked to Beirut on a flight from Athens toRome in June 1985. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17days, and U.S. Navy diver Robert Stetham was killed.   Brandtjen said that Hamadi admitted joining the radicalHezbollah group after the TWA incident. One of Hamadi's brothers,Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security chief in Beirut.   ``He told me he has belonged to Hezbollah since the autumn of1985 or 1986, but I cannot remember exactly the year,'' Brandtjensaid.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for pro-Iraniangroups holding 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, hostage inLebanon.   Earlier, one of the judges asked witness Helga Marx if sherecognized Mohammed, and she said she was unsure.   Her testimony came as the court tried to establish Hamadi'smovements and actions before the hijacking. Hamadi has given onlyvague accounts of where he was.   Before the trial, Mrs. Marx told police she met Hamadi and hisbrother Abbas in the town of Merzig, at a party in an apartmentbuilding where she lived. Abbas Hamadi was living in the samebuilding.   The judge reminded her of what she had told police and asked:``Would you answer this question differently if you had not beenthreatened?''   She replied: ``Of course, I would answer differently.''   Asked whether the threat was written or verbal, Mrs. Marxreplied: ``I have four children. They said it would be better andhealthier for me if I don't say anything.''   There was no explanation of who made the threat.   Mohammed Hamadi then stood up and said: ``Could the person yousaw have been taller, stronger built and with different hair?''   Mrs. Marx replied: ``No. The person looked exactly like you.''   The chief judge asked Abbas Hamadi whether he would testifyabout his brother's age, a key issue in the trial, or aboutexplosives Mohammed Hamadi is charged with trying to smuggle intoWest Germany.   His age determines whether he would be sentenced as a juvenile,young adult or adult.   Abbas Hamadi refused both requests.   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13,1987, trying to smuggle three bottles of liquid explosives into thecountry.   He has told the court that Abbas Hamadi managed to get throughcustoms undetected, although he also was carrying liquidexplosives. The brothers arrived in Frankfurt together from Beirut,Lebanon.   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was arrested Jan. 26, 1987, at FrankfurtAirport when he returned after the kidnappings of West GermansRudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt in Beirut. Schmidt was freed inSeptember, but Cordes remains a hostage.   He was convicted of masterminding the kidnappings in a bid toforce his brother's release. A Duesseldorf court sentenced him to13 years in prison in April.</TEXT></DOC>
