But the political assassinationthat lies at the heart of this detailed account of conspiracyand cover-up hasn't been fictionalized at all. Mr. Stone usesthe murder of a real president and the real footage thatrecorded it as the centerpiece for his film, and from thiscore of truth elaborates on theories about who was behind theassassination. But the film makes no distinctions betweentruth and supposition, a melding that's distracting and alittle maddening to anyone who's read enough on the subjectto believe no one really has the answer.   In other words, Mr. Stone's power as a film maker -- aspropagandist, really -- is the most unnerving thing about&quot;JFK.&quot; At the end one feels thankful the director works forHollywood and not for the government -- any government. Heknows very well how to combine the manipulative dazzle of apolitical film maker like Costa Gavras with the high-mindedpopulism of a Hollywood film maker like Frank Capra. I couldimagine a studio script reader summarizing the picture as &quot;Z&quot;meets &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The director has said that he set out to create an&quot;alternate myth&quot; to the findings of the Warren Commission,which concluded in 1964, 10 months after the Kennedyshooting, that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. Mr.Stone's urge was an understandable one, especially since agreat many people have called the commission's findings intoquestion since then (and since he, as a film maker, hasundertaken to put his imprint on much of our recent history,with pictures such as &quot;Salvador,&quot; &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Born on theFourth of July&quot; and &quot;Wall Street&quot;).   But it wasn't Mr. Stone's style to take the approach of&quot;Rashomon,&quot; the Kurosawa film that re-created a murder fromthe point of view of all the participants in order tounderscore the ambiguity of truth. For his take on theKennedy killing he needed a hero, a protagonist to guide hisviewers through the morass of detail that was accumulated byconspiracy theorists. He settled on Jim Garrison, the formerNew Orleans district attorney who for several years made acareer publicly and vociferously trying to prove that themurder was an attempted &quot;coup d'etat&quot; masterminded at thehighest levels of government and carried out by a sordidgroup of low-level CIA and FBI operatives and hangers-on.   The real Jim Garrison (cast in the movie, ironically orinsultingly, as Chief Justice Earl Warren, who headed thecommission) is a professional politician whose prosecutorialmethods and theories have been widely discredited even byother conspiracy theorists. As the film's Garrison, Mr. Stonetook his cue from Capra and cast Kevin Costner, anall-American actor whose hesitant manner and entire beingsuggests forthrightness, in the tradition of Capra's favoriteicon of homey candor and trustworthiness, James Stewart.   These casting decisions set the tone for the film's skewedrelation to life and history. Mr. Stone's Garrison is ahumble family man struggling for truth against all odds. Heseems to have more in common with another Kevin Costnercharacter, the Eliot Ness of Brian De Palma's &quot;TheUntouchables,&quot; than with the real Mr. Garrison. The script,by Mr. Stone and Zachary Sklar, even gives Garrison the samebiblical bent of tongue that screenwriter David Mamet wrotefor Mr. Costner's Ness.   Mr. Costner, in his stolid way, makes this charactercredible, even through a long-winded summation to the jurythat lays out Mr. Stone's message: that the system we lovehas been corrupted and it's up to every citizen to fight itin order to save it. He even manages to pull off therequisite family scenes, meant, presumably, to show thesacrifices the prosecutor had to make in order to pursue hisobsession.   Poor Sissy Spacek, who as Mrs. Garrison has nothing to dobut alternate between nagging her husband for spending toolittle time at home and showing sympathy to him when shecomes to believe that he really is pursuing a higher cause.She manages to radiate so much depth of feeling that thesesketches, so obviously calculated to humanize the prosecutorwithout revealing much at all about him, actually carry someemotional resonance.   The picture's excitement doesn't lie within the characterof Jim Garrison, of course. It comes from the way Mr. Stonebuilds the evidence, reminding us of extraordinary questionsleft unanswered about the way government employees handledthe assassination. Why, for example, was there no record ofthe 12-hour interrogation of Oswald that immediately followedhis arrest? Why was Oswald, a defector to the Soviet Union,so easily readmitted to this country at a time when the ColdWar was in full force?   Mr. Stone tells his story in a series of flashbacks andpictorial narrations of testimony, whose authenticity isheightened by real documentary footage intercut with fakedocumentary footage. He introduces a netherworld of politicalfanatics, mercenaries and low-level criminals who JimGarrison believed were links to a broad, frighteningconspiracy that ultimately led to the assassinations ofRobert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. He presents Oswald(Gary Oldman) as a dream figure, a shadowy composite of theassassin imprinted onto our national consciousness and the&quot;patsy&quot; he said he was -- before he, too was murdered -- thefall guy for larger forces of evil.   It may be dubious history, but it's powerful film makingthat at the very least accomplishes what Mr. Stone said heset out to do -- to offer the world an alternate myth.   ---   A friend of mine said she didn't see any point in updating&quot;Father of the Bride,&quot; since the 1950 picture (starringSpencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor) perfectly captured theanxiety a middle-class father feels when his daughter getsmarried.   I was inclined to agree with her until I saw the new film,with Steve Martin as the father and Kimberly Williams as thedaughter. With only a couple of nods to the passage of time(the daughter's fiance wants her to be a great architect andthere's a joke about condoms), the new version adheres to theconventional approach of the original, but with a charm allits own.   With barely a hint of satire (excepting Martin Short'svery funny bit as a hyperactive &quot;wedding planner&quot;), thepicture records an upper-middle-class family's travails as itplans a wedding. Mr. Martin is very sweet and very funny, andyou may cry even if you think the idea of this kind ofwedding is ridiculous.</TEXT></DOC>
