ATandamp;T officials said they hope the complaint will lead to areversal of a Federal Communications Commission policy that exemptsATandamp;T competitors from having to file tariffs with the FCC detailingrates and other terms they offer customers.   In its complaint to the FCC, ATandamp;T alleged that MCI has usedunlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to wincontracts with the Pentagon, Merrill Lynch; Westin, Hilton andVista hotels; United Airlines, the University of Colorado andUniguard Security Insurance Co.   ``The commission's regulatory reforms have not kept pace withthe fierce growth of interexchange competition,'' Francine J.Perry, ATandamp;T's vice president for legal affairs, said in a letter tothe FCC accompanying the complaint.   To promote competition in long-distance and data transmissionservices with the then-impending breakup of the Bell System, theFCC in 1983 granted ``forbearance'' to non-dominant carriers onfiling rate tariffs with the commission.   ATandamp;T said it viewed that decision as a ``transitional, interimstep'' that would lead to ``eliminating ... unnecessary regulatoryrestraints'' _ such as disclosing its rate offerings to businesscustomers _ for all long-distance carriers, including itself.   Because ATandamp;T alone has to file tariffs with the FCC, ``MCI andother competitors have gained unwarranted advantages in themarketplace by selectively providing services on an off-tariffbasis,'' Berry said.   MCI, which filed a similar complaint against ATandamp;T last yearafter ATandamp;T won a contract for Holiday Inns' long-distance andreservation system, called Monday's complaint a ``smokescreen.''   ``ATandamp;T is merely trying to achieve its own deregulation throughthe complaint process,'' said Pam Small, an MCI spokeswoman.``They're essentially challenging the rules.''   Ms. Small said MCI maintains that ATandamp;T should still be requiredto detail its rates through tariff filings with the FCC because, asthe dominant carrier, it still holds 80 percent of thelong-distance and interstate data transmission market.   Herb Linnen, spokesman for ATandamp;T, said FCC figures show thecompany holds about 68 percent of the market, far less than thealmost-total control it once held.   Generally, in telecomunications or other regulated industries,companies must adhere to tariffs filed with regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
