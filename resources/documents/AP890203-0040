(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot police arrested nine people during asecond night of arson and rock-and-bottle throwing that erupted in amostly black neighborhood following reports a suspected drug dealerdied in police custody.   ``The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots,you're going to get arrested,'' said Mayor Sandy Freedman afterpolice controlled the disturbance Thursday.   About 70 police officers cordoned off the College Hillneighorhood for nearly three hours after sunset. An officer hit by abrick, Sgt. B.J. Curry, was treated at Tampa General Hospital andreleased.   ``It was very sporadic. Nothing on a major scale. It was kind ofhit and run,'' said Sgt. Walter Sluga.   The Tampa incidents came as residents and officials in Miami seekto maintain calm in the city's Overtown and Liberty City districts,the scene of three days of rioting last month following the fatalshooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman.   The College Hill neighborhood, the site of at least a half dozenviolent outbreaks in the past two years, erupted in a three-hourmelee Wednesday night following the drug arrest of Edgar AllenPrice, 40, who later died of a cardiac arrest.   ``People feel trapped and they're ready to explode when somethingeven looks like brutality,'' said Eliott Johnson, pastor of BlessedHope Ministries two blocks from a looted grocery store. ``We'restill sitting on a keg of dynamite down here.'   A mob of youths began throwing rocks and bottles at the officerswho struggled to subdue Price, a 6-foot-3, 300-pound black man fromHouston. Eight officers were finally called in to capture Price inthe living room of his girlfriend's mother.   The girl's mother, a heart patient with a pacemaker who uses awalker, ended up under the pileup on the floor. She was not injured.   Price, who suffered a two-inch gash in his head during thestruggle, began experiencing heart trouble in a police cruisershortly after his arrest. He died about 90 minutes later at St.Joseph's Hospital.   Police said Price was not beaten or choked during the arrest, andan autopsy was being performed to substantiate the cause of death.   ``We wanted to dispel any rumors we beat a man to death,'' saidPolice Chief Austin McLane.   Dr. Charles Diggs, an assistant Hillsborough County medicalexaminer, said preliminary autopsy results suggest Price may havesuffocated in the police cruiser because his breathing wasconstricted due to being handcuffed.   Price was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded.25-caliber derringer in his pockets, said police spokesman SteveCole.   Price was sentenced in 1974 to 50 years on a Texas robberyconviction and also had a 1967 robbery arrest on his record, saidCole. He did not know the disposition of that case.   During Wednesday night's unrest, an estimated 75 young peoplethrew rocks and bottles, fired at least two gunshots at a televisionnews van and looted and burned a grocery store. Officials cordonedoff four intersections in the 22-block housing development andsummoned 100 police officers and 30 firefighters.   At least four officers received minor injuries, and a 21-year-oldman was arrested on charges of inciting to riot, disorderly conductand drinking in public.   There was no official estimate of the size of the crowd involvedin Thursday's unrest, although it was believed smaller than the 50to 75 youths believed involved in Wednesday's unrest. Among the ninepeople arrested were four members of the African People's SocialistParty from St. Petersburg.   Last April, a crowd of 400 threw rocks and bottles following thearrest of a robbery suspect in the neighborhood, and violenceerupted in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died inpolice custody. A white police officer who used a neck hold tosubdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing, but the neck holdwas banned.</TEXT></DOC>
