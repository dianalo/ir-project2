Freedman and Laurie HaysStaff Reporters of The Wall Stret Journal</HL><DD> 01/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DD WNEWSCHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   Du Pont Co. named two top-level executives as part of its efforts to continue grooming its next chief executive officer and provide new leadership for its Conoco Inc. unit.    In a move that was widely expected, Du Pont's vice chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., was named president and chief operating officer.    In addition, Constantine S. Nicandros was named president and chief executive of Conoco.    The promotions consolidate the power of the 52-year-old Mr. Woolard and signal that Du Pont and Conoco are likely to stick to their current strategies. Mr. Woolard's advancement also appears to confirm widespread speculation that the giant chemicals and energy concern intends for him to succeed Richard E. Heckert, 63, as chairman and chief executive.    Mr. Nicandros, 53, has been president of Conoco's world-wide petroleum operations. When his new assignment begins March 1, he will remain an executive vice president of Du Pont and a member of its executive committee. Du Pont acquired the Houston-based energy concern in 1981.    In addition, Ralph E. Bailey, vice chairman of Du Pont and chairman of Conoco, will retire, effective March 31. When Mr. Bailey, 62, steps down, his posts will be abolished.    According to the company's announcements, Mr. Woolard assumes new posts, and his old position will be eliminated. Mr. Nicandros also assumes a new post, which takes in his previous responsibilities for the petroleum operations.    Mr. Nicandros has helped Conoco earn a reputation as a lean, fast-moving organization with fewer layers of bureaucracy than many of its competitors by trimming staff and becoming directly involved in operations.    Nevertheless, Mr. Nicandros has had to make painful cutbacks because of sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Earlier this month, he decided to close Conoco's big Milne Point drilling operation in Alaska. Although the site opened in December 1985 amid much fanfare, it quickly ran into trouble as the price of crude oil fell. The decision to close Milne Point &quot;took some guts,&quot; said a Conoco insider, &quot;but it probably got applause.&quot;    Mr. Nicandros said, &quot;You could continue to eat it (the operating loss) and be very proud of being in Alaska, or you could say, 'Hey, proud as I may be, I'm not in the business of losing money.'&quot;    Mr. Nicandros, who rose through the ranks as a strategic planner, quickly earned a reputation at the company for helping it to maintain its own identity. After Conoco was acquired by Du Pont, he forbade the oil company's employees to answer any questions from Du Pont's Wilmington, Del., headquarters until the requests had been cleared by him.    &quot;A lot of people were trying to handle us like a department of Du Pont,&quot; he once recalled. &quot;We told them forget it. Most of the time, it was just an awful lot of people making work.&quot;    Despite a hands-on style as a manager, Mr. Nicandros likes to delegate authority. For example, he avoids getting involved in decisions about fuel prices or production-run levels. &quot;I don't expect anyone to be right all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;As long as they are right most of the time, delegation works very well.&quot;    In recent years, Du Pont has tried to adopt the business philosophy, which includes giving subordinates more latitude, that Mr. Nicandros is widely credited with fostering. Second-guessing, he believes, creates a competitive disadvantage. In his view, rank-and-file employees need to hold themselves more accountable for their performance.    In his new role, Mr. Woolard will take on the additional responsibility of overseeing Conoco. After spending most of his career in the company's textile-fibers business, he was named vice chairman in 1985 in response to what some viewed as pressure from Seagram Co., a major shareholder. </TEXT></DOC>
