Now, withthe coup having collapsed and its leaders under arrest,Beijing must contend with hurt pride and a Soviet Union thatcould emerge from this week's turmoil more at oddsideologically with China's Marxist leaders than ever before.   &quot;China is a loser&quot; in the event, said Miron Mushkat, chiefregional economist at Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. &quot;Idon't expect Chinese leaders to be thrilled about it.&quot;   Political analysts said that although the return of Mr.Gorbachev to the Kremlin isn't likely to damage Sino-Sovietties, the relationship will remain as it was before the coupattempt -- cordial, and nothing more. China's leaders neverhave liked Mr. Gorbachev and his reform-minded ways, but theylike Boris Yeltsin even less. Analysts said that inparticular, Beijing is worried that the maverick Russianpresident's deft handling of the coup attempt, placing him atthe height of his popularity and power, will speed thebreakup of the Soviet empire, which in turn could encourageethnic unrest among China's own minorities.   In Beijing, intellectuals were heartened by the latestdevelopments in Moscow, seeing them as a sign that democraticforces that overcame the coup will one day prevail in China.More immediately, they are concerned that Beijing'shard-liners, threatened by the success of Mr. Yeltsin, willmove to ferret out reformist elements.   The conservatives will &quot;of course tighten their grip onthe media and intellectuals, but what difference does it makewhen we already haven't got much freedom left?&quot; asked aChinese scholar in Beijing.   In an attempt to salvage the situation, the Chinesegovernment on Thursday welcomed the news that Mr. Gorbachevhad resumed his duties. The official Xinhua news agencyreported that in a meeting with N.N. Soloviev, the Sovietambassador to China, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: &quot;Werespect the choice the Soviet people made.&quot; Elsewhere, theChinese media reported the end of the coup in briefdispatches with no additional commentary. The muted responsewas in sharp contrast to the prominent coverage the statemedia devoted to the Kremlin hard-liners during the first twodays of the attempted coup.   A source close to the Beijing-controlled Wen Wei Pao, aHong Kong daily, said the newspaper received instructionsfrom Beijing on Monday night to provide prominent coverage ofthe coup attempt. Toeing the official line, the Wen Wei Paodevoted three pages Tuesday to the downfall of Mr. Gorbachev,emphasizing the economic woes and social disintegration thataccompanied glasnost and perestroika during the president'ssix-year reign.   In Beijing, the Guangming Daily praised Mr. Yanayev forhis orthodox Marxist beliefs. The only reference to theSoviet opposition in the Chinese media was the Mr. Yanayev'swarning to Mr. Yeltsin to stop inciting workers to strike andother &quot;illegal acts.&quot;   In its media splash, the Beijing leadership was in effectwarning China's own radical reformers that any attempts toimitate Mr. Gorbachev's policies would meet a fate similar tothe Soviet leader's. So with the collapse of the coup,Beijing has been left with egg on its face. &quot;The Chineseleaders made fools of themselves in front of the world bybacking the coup plotters, who were despised by the West,&quot;said the Chinese scholar. &quot;It's a shame.&quot;   Probably the only thing that saved China from greaterembarrassment has been the Foreign Ministry's quiet approachto the coup. On Tuesday, a ministry spokesman said only thatthe events were an &quot;internal matter&quot; in which other countriesshouldn't interfere.   That line reflects a pragmatic tone to China's foreignpolicy that has prevailed since paramount leader DengXiaoping directed late last year that Beijing concentrate ondomestic matters and not meddle in other nation's affairs.That directive has apparently held back China's ideologuesfrom publicly attacking Mr. Gorbachev. And unless Mr. Denghas a change of heart, analysts don't expect China to adopt aconfrontational stand toward the Soviet Union even if Moscownow embarks on radical reforms.   At the same time, analysts rule out the possibility of afull Sino-Soviet rapprochement now that Mr. Yeltsin hasemerged as a considerable force. Beijing dislikes Mr.Gorbachev for tolerating political pluralism and ethnicstrife and for his disregard for the socialist tenets thatunderpin Beijing's hard-line rule. These differences haveprevented Sino-Soviet ties from expanding much since the twocountries normalized relations in 1989.   But Beijing has tolerated Mr. Gorbachev, if only becausehe is less radical and more predictable than the likes of Mr.Yeltsin. The disdain Beijing feels for the Russian presidentwas clear when Chinese Communist Party chief Jiang Zeminsnubbed Mr. Yeltsin's request for a meeting during Mr.Jiang's visit to Moscow in May. &quot;China is less likely tosleep in the same bed as Mr. Yeltsin,&quot; said Baring's Mr.Mushkat. &quot;It would feel more isolated and lonelyideologically.&quot;   Drawing lessons from the failed coup, the Beijingleadership is expected to step up its campaign to flush outradical reformers in the Communist Party, analysts said. Evenbefore the coup attempt, China's extreme hard-liners hadintensified their efforts to counter the perceived threat of&quot;peaceful evolution,&quot; a euphemism for capitalist economicinfiltration that the communist hard-liners believe subvertssocialist rule.   &quot;The collapse of the Soviet coup will provide illusionsfor pro-democracy forces in China,&quot; said Woo Tun-oy, alecturer at Hong Kong's Baptist College who specializes inthe Chinese economy. &quot;At the same time, Beijing's leaderswill shore up their position by strengthening ideologicalcontrol and stamping out opposition elements before they growinto a force to be reckoned with.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
