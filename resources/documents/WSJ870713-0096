The provision, passed with bipartisan support on an 87-7 vote, would mandate for the first time U.S. action against specific countries -- rather than particular industries -- for unfair trading practices. The last major amendment to the sweeping trade bill, it would call for negotiations or retaliation aimed at reducing foreign barriers to U.S. exports.    To narrow the U.S. trade deficit, &quot;we must dramatically expand our exports,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). &quot;The best place to push for expansion of our exports is in those closed markets with large surpluses.&quot; He said the amendment offered a &quot;way to come to terms with Japan over our trade problems.&quot;    Senators embraced the amendment as an alternative to the House-passed trade bill's controversial Gephardt amendment, which has been criticized as protectionist. Under the amendment sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), countries would be required to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S. or face automatic retaliation.    The Senate version gives the president substantial discretion in deciding whether to retaliate, unlike the Gephardt amendment's requirement of dollar-for-dollar retaliation against unfair trade practices. It also emphasizes boosting U.S. exports to reduce the U.S. trade gap rather than threatening to close U.S. markets to imports.    Reagan administration officials expressed opposition to the amendment passed Friday on the Senate floor, but congressional sources said the administration would accept the Senate version, if it emerges from a House-Senate conference.    &quot;The difference is protectionism versus reciprocity, market closing versus market opening,&quot; said Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), who drafted the amendment with Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.). Added Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.): &quot;We don't have a son of Gephardt, or a cousin or a stepchild, but a clear alternative.&quot;    The amendment would set up a framework for presidential action against countries that erect &quot;major barriers&quot; to U.S. exports. It would require the president to identify countries that maintain a &quot;consistent pattern&quot; of barriers to American products or employ unfair trade practices, such as illegal government subsidies to industry or dumping, which is selling at below cost. Negotiations would then have to begin to eliminate these barriers or to gain compensation for the value of lost export opportunities.    If negotiations failed, the amendment authorizes the president to retaliate through quotas or tariffs. But unlike the Gephardt amendment, the Senate version would give the president wide discretion in determining the form of retaliation, which senators acknowledged could be only a slap on the wrist. Furthermore, the Senate measure would provide broad authority for the president to waive retaliation if it isn't in the national interest.    &quot;This is going to be the law of the land,&quot; predicted Sen. Danforth after the vote. &quot;Both parties, all philosophies from protectionist to free trade, all regions, all sectors of the economy endorsed this amendment.&quot;    The Senate continues work on the huge trade bill tomorrow, and is expected to pass the legislation this week. Even though the Reagan administration might eventually accept the Senate's retaliatory amendment, the adminstration has been threatening a veto of the overall bill for such provisions as mandatory advance notice of plant closings. </TEXT></DOC>
