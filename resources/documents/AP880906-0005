Tiffany Moore, who had been sent away by her mother to live withrelatives in the South because of the violence in her Roxburyneighborhood, was home for a visit when she was shot twice in thehead Aug. 19 while sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends.   More than 400 people attended the funeral. In the weeks sincethe shooting, neighborhood leaders have met with the mayor andpolice commissioner to demand a war on crime. Some even suggestedthat the National Guard be called up.   At meetings in the adjacent Roxbury and Dorchester sections,people have developed proposals that include circulating the namesand pictures of known drug dealers. Some activists have gatheredhundreds of signatures on petitions calling for evening courtsessions to handle drug-related cases.   Bruce Bolling, Roxbury's representative in the Boston CityCouncil, said the shooting had ``galvanized this community ... likenothing else in years.''   In 29 years of law enforcement, said Deputy PoliceSuperintendent William R. Celester, ``I have never seen thecooperation I have seen in the past three weeks ... People aretelling me to take the gloves off and take back the streets.''   Bolling suggested why the death of the girl had touched peopleso deeply.   ``A little girl, totally innocent _ people can relate to that,because they think of their own families, and suddenly theyrecognize how vulnerable they are and how pervasive this problemhas become,'' he said.   Violence in Roxbury had captured the community's attention bythe time of Tiffany's killing. In July, two undercover state policetroopers were wounded when they attempted to make a drug ``buy.''Within hours of the two shootings, a Boston police office also waswounded, and police wounded a suspect in an unrelated shooting.   A week after Tiffany's death, Richard Bailey, 14, was fatallystabbed in front of his sister and other children. Police said thestabbing stemmed from an earlier fight and may have been connectedto young gang activity.   The pressure on police was intense to make quick arrests in thetwo killings. At one point, Boston police Commissioner FrancisRoache publicly rejected the calls by activists to call in theNational Guard. Roache said the city's 1,900-member police forcecould handle the situation.   Thirty detectives were assigned full-time to hunt for Tiffany'skillers; within two weeks, they had arrested two suspects. Foursuspects were arrested in the 14-year-old boy's stabbing.   Police also have assigned two police officers to walk the streetin the Roxbury neighborhood where Tiffany was killed.   Two years ago, the violence in Roxbury had so alarmed Tiffany'smother that she sent Tiffany and an older sister to live withrelatives in Greenville, S.C.   Tiffany was in Boston for a two-week visit with her mother; onAug. 21, two days after the shooting, she was supposed to return toSouth Carolina.   Alice Moore, her mother, was upstairs in her apartment that hotnight, lying on her bed and talking with a friend, when ``A littlegirl ran up and said Tiffany get shot and I ran down.   ``I didn't take time to put on my shoes or lock my door ornothing, but when I got there, she was already dead. I was rubbingher skin and it was tightening up. I called her name and I calledher name and she didn't say nothing.''   Mrs. Moore, sitting in her living room under a tapestry of Jesusand a portrait of Marthur Luther King Jr., said people cared abouther daughter's death not just because she was so innocent butbecause she was special.   Tiffany's ambition, she said, was to become a doctor or teacher.She played the organ and trombone. She like to talk with herfriends as they took turns braiding each other's hair.   Mrs. Moore said she's talked with all the politicians, reportersand television crews who visit her apartment because ``It makes mefeel like people care.''   Holding a diary Tiffany kept and looking at family snapshots,Mrs. Moore said: ``I was trying for them to be somebody, not justhanging on the street.''</TEXT></DOC>
