Based on its price-to-earnings ratio, Martin Marietta'sstock is trading at a discount to some other Pentagoncontractors, and its shares are languishing far below themarket multiple. &quot;It's a little perplexing, and a littledisappointing,&quot; says Marcus Bennett, the Bethesda, Md.,company's chief financial officer.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bennett says he believes investors have lumped MartinMarietta in the same category as struggling defense concerns,when in fact, &quot;we are in markets that should really grow.&quot;   Of course, every military contractor makes the same claim-- that it is one of the few companies that is poised toprosper during the industry's current downturn.   But Martin Marietta has become a particular favorite amongsome Wall Street analysts. Several brokerages, includingKemper Securties Group and Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.,recently rated Martin Marietta a buy.   For the first quarter, the Street's estimate that thecompany will earn about $1.40 a share is &quot;a reasonableconsensus,&quot; Mr. Bennett says. In the year-earlier period,Martin Marietta had net income of $67.1 million, or $1.32 ashare.   Sales for the latest three months, he says, should come inabout flat with the $1.42 billion registered a year ago.   For the full year, Mr. Bennett says he is comfortable withearnings estimates in the $7-a-share range. In 1990, MartinMarietta posted net of $327.6 million, or $6.52 a share, onsales of $6.13 billion.   &quot;We're on a very stable course,&quot; Mr. Bennett says, notingthat the company has shown year-to-year earnings improvementin 15 of the past 16 quarters.   &quot;I can understand that people are questioning whether wecan sustain some of the best return-on-equity levels in theindustry,&quot; he adds. &quot;But we've got good steady financials.&quot;   Specifically, he says more than 55% of Martin Marietta's1991 earnings should come from two pieces of the Pentagonbudget that will fare well in an era when overall militaryspending declines: space and intelligence systems, andelectro-optical targeting equipment.   Recently, Martin Marietta announced that it would supplythe targeting system for the Army's next-generation lighthelicopter, a business that could be worth as much as $2billion over the next 15 years. The company also has plans tobid for the electro-optical system on the Air Force'sAdvanced Tactical Fighter, potentially worth $1 billion overthe progrma's life.   Another roughly 30% of Martin Marietta's net this yearwill come from non-defense markets. Among the richestopportunities, Mr. Bennett says, stems from a recent EnergyDepartment contract renewal to manage severalresearch-and-development facilities. The company, heexplains, could conceivably see as much as $95 million inannual fees for each of the next five years under the termsof the pact.   Mr. Bennett says he also foresees good growth in thecompany's information systems operation, which wasrestructured earlier in the year, and the probability of anabout-face by the company's crushed-stone business, which washurt in the first quarter by the slow economy.   In fact, he says, it's likely Martin Marietta will make anacquisition or two to enhance its aggregates division, thoughsuch a buy &quot;won't be anything earthshaking&quot; in terms of size.Mr. Bennett says the company is also &quot;looking for anappropriate acquisition in defense,&quot; though nothing looksterribly tempting at the moment.   Moreover, although the company will have a positive cashflow in 1991, it is likely to hold off on any sizablepurchase until it makes a $400 million deferred tax paymentlater this year.   But, he says, steady earnings increases represent the bestway to improve shareholder value. That, however, means anabsence of write-downs in an industry that has taken morethan $4 billion of charges during the past two years.   During the past 25 years, he notes, Martin Marietta hasmanaged $44 billion of government defense and space business,with contract losses of only $181 milllionless than half apercent.   &quot;We're not in a riskless business,&quot; Mr. Bennett says. &quot;I'mproud of our record.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
