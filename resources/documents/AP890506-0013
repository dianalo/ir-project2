Pry, the American director of theInternational Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.   On the other hand, the higher prices that consumers pay whensubsidies are eliminated can lead to hunger, the group said.   Pry was briefing staff members from Congress and others onFriday.   He said trade negotiators in Geneva should consider whethercompensation should be given to countries that will suffereconomically as a result of lower subsidies.   He also said Third World countries not taking part in thenegotiations ought to attend the trade talks in their own interest.   Wouter Tims, a member of the institute's council, said that theUnited States would benefit from lower domestic prices for food andmore sales abroad if subsidies were reduced.   ``Exports of (U.S.) wheat and coarse grains (would) dominate themarket, with a share of 90 percent by the year 2000,'' he wasquoted as saying in the institute's monthly ``Options.''   ``The outcomes for developing countries such as Kenya, Nigeria,Argentina and Thailand are positive, but for others, such asBrazil, Mexico, Egypt and possibly Indonesia and India, there aresignificant net losses,'' he added.   Pry said experts from his headquarters at Laxenburg, Austria,will go later this month to Geneva, where representatives of nearly100 countries are working on trade agreements they hope to completeby the end of 1990. On Thursday the Senate Finance Committeerecommended confirmation of Rufus H. Yerxa as the chief Americannegotiator.   Major governments have agreed to reduce farm subsidiessubstantially, but not to eliminate them entirely by the year 2000as the United States has asked.   The institute has published two volumes of a massivethree-volume study called ``Toward Free Trade in Agriculture.''Harvey Brooks, chairman of the U.S. Committee for the Institute,said it cost $4 million just to get agreement on the basic figuresused.   The third volume, to be published later this year, will dealwith hunger.   ``The average per capita calorie intake in the developingcountries decreases under agricultural trade liberalization by(western industrial) countries, and consequently the incidence ofhunger increases,'' the report said.   ``Trade liberalization'' means reduction of subsidies.   So far there has been little public discussion on thesesubsidies.   ``National governments are spending over $120 billion per yearsubsidizing surplus production and the cost of its disposal,'' thestudy said.   ``Some developing countries benefit from the subsidized disposalof surplus cereals on the world market. This, however, is only ashort term gain.   ``Low prices are a disincentive to their own producers and lead,in the long run, to an unsustainable dependence on imports, as isthe case in many parts of Africa.''   The group has 16 member countries, including the United Statesand the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
