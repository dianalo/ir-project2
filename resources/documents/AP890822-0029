(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tammy Faye Bakker says she is confident herhusband will be acquitted of fraud and bribery charges in thediversion of $4 million from the now-defunct PTL television ministry.   While Jim Bakker went on trial Monday in Charlotte, N.C., Mrs.Bakker continued their new ``Jim and Tammy'' shows to eight cable TVoutlets around the country.   In a live broadcast from their makeshift TV studio at a shoppingmall in Orlando, Mrs. Bakker said the government was doingeverything it could to keep their church off the air.   But she added, raising a fist, ``We're going to win!''   Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with diverting $4million from the PTL treasury to support a lavish lifestyle.   During the television show, Mrs. Bakker shed tears, giggled andprayed with her guests and 35 members of a studio audience.   Mrs. Bakker said there were ``terrible things happening inCharlotte. ... It's like a circus.   ``Not only Jim is on trial, but I believe the church is ontrial,'' she said.   She blew a kiss to her husband, whom she said would be watchingthe program, and said: ``I love you sweetheart. Be a brave soldier.Don't you dare give up.''   She also urged supporters to call a special pledge line to makedonations, saying that the new TV ministry, which began broadcastingfrom here earlier this year, may have to go off the air because of``a mountain of finances'' and debts of $200,000 she and her husbandincurred months ago.   But she made no direct mention of a special $1 million legaldefense fund which the Bakkers started last month.   Phones jangled sporadically throughout the broadcast asvolunteers answered callers pledging money.   The show also included inspirational stories from the Rev. RoyHarthern of the Grace Covenant Baptist Church in Orlando and theRev. John Dawsey of the Lake George Ministries Retreat in LakeGeorge, Fla., where the Bakkers were given ``spiritual refuge'' forseveral months after leaving their home near Charlotte.   Harthern told the TV audience that ``Jim has repented and he'ssincere.'' Later, the minister told reporters that he was therebecause ``Bakker needs a friend. I'm not trying to condone orcondemn. If he's guilty, only God and Jim know whether it wasintentional. I'm convinced there is sincere repentance.''</TEXT></DOC>
