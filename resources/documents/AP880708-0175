Concern that the air-to-ground Mavericks could be used againstIsrael prompted the Senate on Thursday to remove the missiles fromthe $1.8 billion arms purchase by the Persian Gulf state.   Withholding the missiles would make the jets ineffective,department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.   ``Moreover,'' she said, ``it creates confusion about thedirection of U.S. policy in the gulf. Congress and theadministration have long encouraged our friends in the gulf toshare more of the burden of defending the region. Consequently, weare concerned about this situation.''   The State Department in the past few weeks has also voicedconcern about the proliferation of missiles in the Gulf and theMiddle East.   But Mrs. Oakley said the air-to-fround Mavericks ticketed forKuwait were not in the same category as ballistic rockets and didnot pose a threat to peace. ``Clearly, we've supplied variousmissiles in defense of our national interest,'' she said.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater describedPresident Reagan as ``dismayed at the precipitate action taken bythe Senate.''   He said ``the Senate action _ taken in a matter of minuteswithout the benefit of committee hearings or deliberation _ isunfortunate and damaging to U.S. foreign policy interests.''   ``Congress has repeatedly asked what the gulf states are doingfor their own defense,'' he said. ``Kuwait has answered that theywish do more and have indicated their preference to work with us indoing so _ yet some in the Senate apparently wish to reject thisrequest and have Kuwait turn elsewhere.''   The State Department has lobbied for congressional support ofthe Maverick sale to Kuwait as vital to the Arab sheikdom's defenseagainst Iran.   ``By helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibilityfor its own defense it complements our highly successful escortoperations,'' Peter Burleigh, the deputy secretary for Near Easternaffairs, told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday.   He referred to the U.S. Navy's escort of merchant ships carryingoil through the Persian Gulf.   A key congressional opponent of the Maverick purchase, Sen.Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Arab countries buying U.S. arms shouldbe required to ``renounce the use of force and recognize the rightof Israel to exist.''   Mrs. Oakley said the United States would maintain its commitmentto Israel that it have a military margin of safety over thecombined forces of hostile Arab countries.   At the same time, she said, ``some of our objectives in the gulfare to prove that we are a reliable partner in the legitimateself-defense needs of friendly gulf Arab states.''   On Friday, Britain announced it would sell Saudi Arabia 72Tornado jet fighters and other weapons in a $7.5 billion deal.   Mrs. Oakley said the United States did not oppose the deal ``inprinciple'' but did not know all the vital details, includingwhether the British had imposed restrictions to minimize anypotential threat to Israel.   ``Clearly, we would have preferred to make these salesourselves,'' she said.   Asked if the purchase hurt U.S. interests, the spokeswoman said:``Of course, we think it does hurt American interests. We think ourinterests are better served when we can sell legitimateself-defense items to friendly Arab countries, when we can consultwith them, when we can put the restrictions on them that preventthreats to other countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
