(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials today unveiled a50-foot winged rocket of the sort that will be launched from a B-52bomber in October in the first flight of a privately developedbooster designed to put satellites in orbit at low cost.   The gleaming white Pegasus rocket, similar to the pioneeringX-15 rocket plane, was rolled out of a hangar at NASA's Ames-DrydenFlight Research Facility as 400 people watched and a high schoolband played.   Antonio Elias, a scientist who originated the idea for OrbitalSciences Corp., noted its adaptation of technology from Air Forceand Navy missiles and declared Pegasus ``a noteworthy example ofswords turned into plowshares.''   Orbital Sciences Corp. developed the rocket with HerculesAerospace Co. Orbital Sciences spokeswoman Barbara C. Zadina saidthat at a cost of $6 million to $8 million per launch, ``we arelowering the threshold for getting into space.''   While the Pentagon and NASA are interested in using Pegasusrockets for military and scientific projects, ``you're going to seestates, small countries or university programs that want to getinto space,'' Zadina said Wednesday. ``Now, for $6 million, theycan afford a dedicated launch.''   Before the Challenger disaster in 1986, NASA was charging about$35 million to deploy a large satellite. Last year, NASArecommended a $110 million fee for a shuttle payload.   Pegasus will allow small satellites to be launched at low costfor astronomy, environmental and other research, said Robert Pincusof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's GoddardSpace Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.   An Orbital Sciences brochure calls Pegasus a ``wingedworkhorse'' _ apparently after the winged horse of mythology.   The Pegasus rocket unveiled today will not be the one launchedin October. Instead, it will be carried aloft under the wings of aNASA B-52 for test flights later this month and in early October.   Later in October, another Pegasus will be released from a B-52about 40,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.The three-stage rocket will ignite and carry into orbit athree-part payload named PEGSAT that contains NASA and Pentagonexperiments.   The first flight also may carry ``a small satellite that will beused by the state of Virginia for environmental monitoring ofChesapeake Bay,'' Zadina said.   Orbital Sciences says the 41,000-pound Pegasus is 49.2 feetlong, 50 inches in diameter and has a delta-shaped wing with a22-foot span.   It can carry into low Earth orbit payloads up to 6 feet long,almost four feet in diameter, and weighing up to 900 pounds,according to Orbital Sciences Corp.   Zadina said the date of the October Pegasus launch remains to bescheduled, and a second flight is due late this year or early in1990.   On the first flight, Pegasus will launch PEGSAT. The first partof the triple payload is a small, experimental Navy communicationsrelay satellite that will separate from PEGSAT once it is in orbit,said Pincus, NASA's PEGSAT project manager.   The Navy wants to learn if such satellites can help it relaydata collected by its weather and oceanographic researchinstruments, according to a statement issued in May by thePentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.   PEGSAT also will carry sensors to collect information onPegasus' surroundings as it is launched. That will help the effortto build lighter, less expensive satellites, Pincus said.   Sixty to 90 days after PEGSAT reaches orbit, it will release itsthird payload _ a series of canisters that will release thechemical barium into space to help NASA scientists study Earth'smagnetic field and the electrically charged particles trappedinside it, he added.   Orbital Sciences and Hercules announced in June that their firstcommercial customer is Ball Corp. Under an agreement, Pegasusrockets will be used to launch two Ball communications satellitesin 1990 or 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
