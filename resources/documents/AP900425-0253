The $90-a-share cash offer exceeds BTR's bid of $1.6 billion, or$75 a share, which was rejected last month by Norton's board ofdirectors.   Wall Street applauded today's announcement. In active trading onthe New York Stock Exchange, Norton jumped $13.50 to $88.75 a shareby midday.   The announced merger with Compagnie Saint-Gobain comes a dayafter a federal judge ordered Worcester-based Norton to reveal theamount of a ``white knight'' offer it said it had received lastweek.   The court order came during a hearing on suits filed on behalfof some Norton shareholders seeking to require Norton to fully andfairly consider BTR's offer and ``take into consideration theinterest of the shareholders.''   Norton told the Securities and Exchange Commission last Fridaythat a third party was interested in buying Norton for more money.   BTR had planned to wage a proxy fight at Norton's annualshareholders' meeting set for Thursday.   But one of Norton's biggest weapons was a new state law thatwould prevent BTR from taking immediate control over the Nortonboard. The law zoomed through the legislature last week and wassigned by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, taking effect immediately. Itpermits a Massachusetts corporation to elect only one-third of itsdirectors at a time, unless the company opts out of the requirement.   BTR had said it wouldn't back down despite the state law.   In a statement, Chairman John S. Nelson said, ``Norton hasfought hard to remain independent because we believed this to bethe ideal for all Norton constituencies.''   But Nelson said a negotiated merger was ``the best alternative''to a BTR bid, which he termed as inadequate.   Norton and Saint-Gobain said the merger was conditioned uponkeeping Norton's headquaters and principal manufacturing operationsin Worcester.   The companies said Norton would continue operating under thesame name and that employee policies and benefits would becontinued at present levels.   Norton also would remain an autonomous company with a separateboard of directors, they said.   ``These are the commitments on which we have formed ourpartnership, and the merger agreement provides specifically thatthese commitments will continue for at least five years,'' Nelsonand Saint-Gobain Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said in a jointstatement.   According to a statement, at least two-thirds of Norton's 20.37million common shares outstanding must be tendered before the fullfinanced cash offer beginning April 30, 1990.   Norton is the world's largest manufacturer of abrasives and aleading producer of engineering materials, including advancedceramics, performance plastics, and chemical process products.Norton, which had 1989 sales of approximately $1.5 billion, employs16,000 people and operates 113 plans in the United States and 25other countries.   Saint-Gobain produces a variety of flat glass, fiber glass,piping, paper and wood products and has annual sales of more than$11 billion. The Paris-based company employees 88,000 people andoperate 350 plants in the United States and 20 other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
