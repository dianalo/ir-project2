Background.  </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-33, Item I. </T3>The FAR's predecessor regulations, the DefenseAcquisition Regulation and the Federal Procurement Regulations, containedguidance on the subject of ratification of unauthorized commitments. Thecoverage was omitted from the FAR, however, pending a decision by the Councilsregarding the need for its inclusion. Item I of this FAC reflects the Councils'decision to include such coverage.  FAC 84-33, Item II. When OMB Circular A-125 was initially issued in August1982, the Federal agencies provided implementing instructions through theirindividual procurement regulations. These regulations were later supersededby the FAR in April 1984. Because the FAR did not specifically includecoverage on OMB Circular A-125, the Federal agencies continued to provideimplementing instructions through their respective FAR supplements. Later,as problems surfaced and amendments were issued to OMB Circular A-125,it became increasingly necessary to establish uniform coverage in the FAR. A proposed rule for FAR Subpart 32.9 was published for public comment inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 17, 1986 (51 FR 25976). Subsequent tothat publication, a number of events occurred that were pertinent to thepolicies and procedures being proposed. The Senate introduced a legislativeinitiative to amend the Prompt Payment Act. The House of RepresentativesCommittee on Government Operations issued a report entitled, ``Prompt PaymentAct Implementation: Improvements Needed.'' The General Accounting Officeissued a report entitled, ``Prompt Payment Act_Agencies Have Not FullyAchieved Available Benefits.'' Therefore, a revised proposed rule was publishedfor public comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 18, 1987 (52 FR 8576).  In developing the final rule, the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council andthe Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council not only took the public commentsinto consideration, but they also considered revisions that had been madeto OMB Circular A-125 on June 9, 1987 (52 FR 21928). A summary of the majorissues affecting the final rule is presented below.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of FAR Coverage  </ITAG>The purpose of the new FAR Subpart 32.9 and the related contract clauseat 52.232-25 is to implement OMB Circular A-125 as it applies to the Government'spurchase of supplies and services from the private sector. The coverageis not intended to address areas outside this scope, such as federal assistanceprograms, Government debt collection, and agency reporting procedures.The coverage also does not implement proposed amendments to the PromptPayment Act, such as subcontract flowdown, reduction in the grace period,and double interest penalties. It was observed that many criticisms ofthe proposed rule were directed more at the Prompt Payment Act and OMBCircular A-125 than the FAR coverage itself. In the event that the PromptPayment Act is amended and OMB Circular A-125 is correspondingly revised,necessary changes will be made to FAR Subpart 32.9 and the related contractclause at 52.232-25.<ITAG tagnum="84">Invoice Payment </ITAG>The proposed rule's standard for establishing the payment due date on contractorinvoices was based on the requirements of OMB Circular A-125. That is,payment will generally be made 30 days after the later of the followingtwo events: (1) Receipt of a proper invoice and (2) Government acceptanceof supplies or services. Some commenters believed that more favorable paymentterms should be permitted, particularly for a few specific industries.Except for existing statutory requirements, no change was made in thisarea because a 30-day standard was considered appropriate in view of thenormal commercial practice of payment in ``net 30.'' This amount of timewas also considered necessary to ensure that Government officials involvedin the payment process had sufficient time to fulfill their responsibilities.Establishing separate standards in FAR Subpart 32.9 for specific industrieswas not feasible due to the vast range of supplies and services purchasedby the Government. Agency heads, however, have been authorized to prescribeadditional standards for establishing payment due dates, where consideredappropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Constructive Acceptance </ITAG>In order to improve the timeliness of invoice payments, the proposed ruleintroduced a concept of constructive acceptance. This concept providedthat solely for purpose of computing an interest penalty that might bedue the contractor, acceptance will be deemed to have occurred on the 5thworking day after contractor delivery. A period greater than 5 workingdays could be incorporated in the contract clause at 52.232-25 where justifiedunder policies and procedures issued by the agency head. Commenters raisedquestions on the practical application of this clause to fixed price constructionand architect-engineer contracts because payment is based on estimatesof work accomplished. Accordingly, Subpart 32.9 was modified to accommodatethis payment method. An alternate to the contract clause was also created.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contract Financing Payments </ITAG>The proposed rule implemented the OMB Circular A-125 requirement to specifya due date in the contract for making contract financing payments, eventhrough such payments would not be subject to interest penalties if paidlate. In so doing, it was essential to furnish a meaningful definitionof invoice payment and contract financing payment. It was also importantto distinguish between progress payments made under the clause at 52.232-5,Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, and the clause at 52.232-10,Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts, from other formsof progress payments more appropriately treated as contract financing payments.The proposed rule allowed agency heads to prescribe due dates for makingcontract financing payments, provided that payment was not made earlierthan the seventh or later than the thirtieth day. The public comments receivedreflected continued confusion over the distinction between invoice paymentsand contract financing payments. The revisions to OMB Circular A-125 madeon June 9, 1987, improved these definitions, and corresponding adjustmentswere made to FAR Subpart 32.9. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-33, Item I. </T3>The proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 18, 1986 (51 FR 9429). The DoD, GSA,and NASA certify that this final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>because very few ratification actions are necessary.<T3>FAC 84-33, Item II. </T3>The proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 18, 1987 (52 FR 6360), contained anInitial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The analysis indicated that thepurpose of the FAR revisions was to consolidate under a single procurementregulation the Federal agencies' implementing guidance on OMB CircularA-125. Further, it stated that the requirements adopted in FAR Subpart32.9 would be consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-125. No public comments were received that addressed the Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis prepared for the proposed rule. A final RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis has been prepared and is on file in the Office ofthe FAR Secretariat. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-33, Item I. </T3>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not applybecause this proposed change to FAR 1.602 does not contain any additionalinformation collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.<T3>FAC 84-33, Item II. </T3>The proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 18, 1987 (52 FR 6360), contained a statementthat the Paperwork Reduction Act did not apply because the rule did notimpose any additional requirements beyond those already imposed by OMB.There were no comments received on that Paperwork Reduction Act statement.The information collection regarding electronic funds transfers containedin Alternate II of the clause at FAR 52.232-25 was approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to a request from the Departmentof the Treasury. OMB Control No. 1510-0056 was assigned to this informationcollection and to Form TFS 3881, Payment Information Form, which is referencedin the clause. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1, 32, and 52 </ITAG>Government procurement. <ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.

These regulations were later superseded by the FAR in April1984. Because the FAR did not specifically include coverage on OMB CircularA-125, the Federal agencies continued to provide implementing instructionsthrough their respective FAR supplements.

This might be the Government disbursingoffice, contract administration office, office accepting the supplies deliveredor services performed by the contractor, or contract audit office. In somecases, different offices might be designated to received invoices and contractfinancing requests.``Designated payment office'' means the place designated in the contractto make invoice payments or contract financing payments. Normally, thiswill be the Government disbursing office.``Discount for prompt payment'' means an invoice payment reduction voluntarilyoffered by the contractor, in conjunction with the clause at 52.232-8,Discounts for Prompt Payment, if payment is made by the Government priorto the due date.``Due date'' means the date on which payment should be made.

This includes payments of partialdeliveries that have been accepted by the Government and final cost orfee payments where amounts owed have been settled between the Governmentand the contractor. For purposes of this subpart, invoice payments alsoinclude all payments made under the clause at 52.232-5, Payments UnderFixed-Price Construction Contracts, and the clause at 52.232-10, PaymentsUnder Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts. Invoice payments do notinclude contract financing payments.``Payment date'' means the date on which a check for payment is dated oran electronic funds transfer is made.``Proper invoice'' means a bill or written request for payments which meetsthe minimum standards specified in the clause at 52.232-25, Prompt Payment(also see 32.905(c)), and other terms and conditions contained in the contractfor invoice submission.``Receiving report'' means written evidence meeting the requirements of32.905(e) which indicates Government acceptance of supplies delivered orservices performed by the contractor (see Subpart 46.6).<ITAG tagnum="80">32.903 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>All contracts subject to this subpart shall specify payment procedures,payment due dates, and interest penalties for late invoice payment.

Payment will be based on receiptof a proper invoice or contract financing request and satisfactory contractperformance. Agency procedures shall ensure that, when specifying due dates,full consideration is given to the time reasonably required by Governmentofficials to fulfill their administrative responsibilities under the contract.Checks will be mailed and electronic funds transfers will be transmittedon or about the same day the payment action is dated. When appropriate,Government contracts should allow the contractor to be paid for partialdeliveries that have been accepted by the Government (see 32.102(d)). Discountsfor prompt payment offered by the contractor shall be taken only when paymentsare made within the discount period specified by the contractor. Agenciesshall pay an interest penalty, without request from the contractor, forlate invoice payments or improperly taken discounts for prompt payment.The interest penalty shall be absorbed within funds available for administrationor operation of the program for which the penalty was incurred.<ITAG tagnum="80">32.904 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities. </ITAG>Agency heads shall establish the policies and procedures necessary to implementthis subpart.

Agency heads may also adopt different paymentprocedures in order to accommodate unique circumstances, provided thatsuch procedures are consistent with the policies set forth in this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="80">32.905 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Invoice payments. </ITAG>(a) Except as prescribed in 32.905(b) and 32.905(c), the due date for makingan invoice payment by the designated payment office shall be the laterof the two events described in subparagraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.(1) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a properinvoice from the contractor; or (2) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or servicesperformed by the contractor. (i) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contractsettlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on theeffective date of the contract settlement. (ii) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might bedue the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurredconstructively on the fifth working day after the contractor has deliveredsupplies or performed services in accordance with the terms and conditionsof the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality,or contractor compliance with a contract requirement. In the event thatactual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, thedetermination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual dateof acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however,compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contractadministration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance,if appropriate due to the nature of the supplies or services to be received,inspected, tested, and accepted by the Government. (iii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment(e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in thecontract. (b) The due date for making payments on contracts that contain the clauseat 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, or theclause at 52.232-10, Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts,shall be as follows: (1) The due date for work or services completed by the contractor shallbe the later of the following two events: (i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a properinvoice from the contractor; or (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completedby the contractor. On a final invoice where the payment amount is subjectto contract settlement actions (e.g., release of claims), acceptance shallbe deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the settlement. Forthe sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due thecontractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructivelyon the 5th working day after the contractor has completed the work or servicesin accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also 32.905(b)(3)).In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptanceperiod, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on theactual date of acceptance. (2) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after Governmentapproval of contractor estimates of work or services accomplished. Forthe sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due thecontractor, Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructivelyon the 5th working day after contractor estimates have been received bythe designated billing office (see also 32.905(b)(3)). In the event thatactual approval occurs within the constructive approval period, the determinationof an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of approval. (3) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirementsdescribed in 32.905 (b)(1) and (b)(2) are conditioned upon receipt of aproper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractorcompliance with contract requirements, or the requested progress paymentamount. These requirements do not compel Government officials to acceptwork or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administrationfunctions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptanceor constructive approval, if appropriate, due to the nature of the workor services involved. (c) The payment terms on contracts for meat and meat food products andcontracts for perishable agricultural commodities are as follows: (1) The due date on contractor invoices for meat or meat food products,as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921(7 U.S.C. 182(3)), as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, will be as closeas possible to, but not later than, the seventh day after product delivery.(2) The due date on contractor invoices for perishable agricultural commodities,as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Actof 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), will be as close as possible to, but not laterthan, the tenth day after product delivery, unless another date is specifiedin the contract. (3) The notice of defect period described in paragraph (d) of this sectionis 3 days on contracts for meat and meat food products and 5 days on contractsfor perishable agricultural commodities. (d) A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (d)(1)through (d)(8) of this section. If the invoice does not comply with theserequirements, then the contractors must be notified of the defect within15 days after receipt of the invoice at the designated billing office.If such notice is not timely, then an adjusted due date for the purposeof determining an interest penalty, if any, will be established in accordancewith 32.907-1(b): (1) Name and address of the contractor. (2) Invoice date. (3) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or servicesperformed (including order number and contract line item number). (4) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended priceof supplies delivered or services performed. (5) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment,prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipmentwill be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading. (6) Name and address of contractor official to whom payment is to be sent(must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment).(7) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing addressof person to be notified in event of a defective invoice. (8) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (suchas evidence of shipment). (e) All invoice payments shall be supported by a receiving report or anyother Government documentation authorizing payment. The receiving reportor other Government documentation should be forwarded to the designatedpayment office by the 5th working day after Government acceptance or approval,unless other arrangements have been made. This period of time does notextend the due dates prescribed in 32.905. The receiving report or otherGovernment documentation authorizing payment shall, as a minimum, includethe following: (1) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or servicesperformed. (2) Description of supplies delivered or services performed. (3) Quantities of supplies received and accepted, if applicable. (4) Date supplies delivered or services performed. (5) Date supplies or services were accepted by the designated Governmentofficial (or progress payment request was approved if being made underthe clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts,or the clause at 52.232-10, Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-EngineerContracts). (6) Signature printed name, title, mailing address, and telephone numberof the designated Government official responsible for acceptance or approvalfunctions. (7) If the contract provides for the use of certified invoices in lieuof a separate receiving report, the certified invoice must also containthe information described in subparagraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of thissection. (f) When a discount for prompt payment is to be taken, payment will bemade as close as possible to, but not later than, the end of the discountperiod. Payment terms are specified in the clause at 52.232-8, Discountsfor Prompt Payment.(g) The designated billing office shall annotate each invoice with thedate a proper invoice was received by the designated billing office. (h) The designated payment office shall annotate each invoice and receivingreport with the date a proper invoice was received by the designated paymentoffice. <ITAG tagnum="80">32.906 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract financing payments. </ITAG>(a) Unless otherwise prescribed in policies and procedures issued by theAgency head, the due date for making contract financing payments by thedesignated payment office will be the 30th day after the designated billingoffice has received a proper request. In the event that an audit or otherreview of a specific financing request is required to ensure compliancewith the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment officeis not compelled to make payment by the due date specified. Agency headsmay prescribe shorter periods for payment, if appropriate based on contractpricing or administrative considerations. For example, a shorter periodmay be justified by an Agency if the nature and extent of contract financingarrangements are integrated with Agency contract pricing policies. A periodshorter than 7 days or longer than 30 days shall not be prescribed. (b) For advance payments, loans, or other arrangements that do not involverecurrent submission of contract financing requests, payment shall be madein accordance with the applicable contract financing terms or as directedby the contracting officer. (c) A proper contract financing request must comply with the terms andconditions specified by contract financing clauses or other authorizingterms. The contractor shall correct any defects in requests submitted inthe manner specified in the contract or as directed by the contractingofficer. (d) The designated billing officer and designated payment office shallannotate each contract financing request with the date a proper requestwas received in their respective offices. <ITAG tagnum="80">32.907 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Interest penalties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">32.907-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Late invoice payment. </ITAG>(a) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated paymentoffice, without request from the contractor, when all of the followingconditions, if applicable, have been met: (1) A proper invoice has been received by the designated billing office.(2) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing paymenthas been processed and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality,or contractor compliance with any contract requirement. (3) In the case of a final invoice, the payment amount is not subject tofurther contract settlement actions between the Government and the contractor.(4) The designated payment office paid the contractor more than 15 daysafter the due date (3 days for meat and meat food products and 5 days forperishable agricultural commodities). (b) The interest penalty computation shall not include (1) the time takenby the Government to notify the contractor of a defective invoice, unlessit exceeds the periods prescribed in 32.905(c)(3) or 32.905(d), or (2)the time taken by contractor to correct the invoice.
