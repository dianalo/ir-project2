Police later backed downand returned the notes.   ``It was a case of an aggressive, young, sometimes overzealousdetective who felt the notes would help the case. We hope to put itto rest,'' said Paul Pash, police commissioner in suburban Warren.   Detective Richard Van Hulle seized the notebook Saturday fromMacomb Daily reporter Cindy Mooty, 27, while she was alone in thenewsroom of the 55,000-circulation newspaper in Macomb County. Hereturned it on Monday.   Herschel Fink, chairman of the State Bar of Michigan Law andMedia Committee, called the seizure a violation of the FirstAmendment.   ``It's so frankly abhorrent to freedom of speech maybe we allfelt comfortable it couldn't happen,'' he said. ``I don't thinkit's a matter that we can allow to pass.''   Fink said his committee will discuss recommendations to theMichigan Supreme Court for a rule to prevent a similar incident.   Mooty said the notes were of interviews with Elizabeth Schultzon the Sept. 21 slaying of Roy Smith III. Smith, 17, was shot froma passing car as he stood on Schultz's porch.   Deputy Chief Carl Muschong said the notebook was held in anevidence locker until it was returned. He said police did not makecopies.   Ben Burns, editor and publisher of the Macomb Daily, said thenewspaper may sue for damages. But he added, ``I'm not interestedin pounding on some officer's head who was trying to do what hethought was a thorough investigation.   ``We've had a very good relationship with the Warren police andwe'd like to maintain that,'' he said.   The search warrant was issued Friday by District Judge DawnnGruenberg, who said police told her Mooty had agreed to turn overthe notes.   ``Under the particular facts I had, I do not believe this was inany way connected to the First Amendment or a free press,'' thejudge said.   The police commissioner and deputy chief said they were notaware a judge had issued a search warrant until it was executed.   Mooty said she told police last week that if they wanted hernotes, they would have to subpoena them and that the newspaperwould probably fight it. She said she never expected a searchwarrant.   Dawn Phillips, general counsel for the Michigan PressAssociation, said Michigan law does not protect a reporter's notes.   At least 26 states have some form of shield law that protectspublished or unpublished information and sources or bars a contemptruling for refusing to submit material, she said.   ``Reporters shouldn't be afraid on a Saturday morning when theygo in to do a story that the police are going to show up,''Phillips said.</TEXT></DOC>
