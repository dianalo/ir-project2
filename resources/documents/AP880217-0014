(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis claimed``a great victory'' in the New Hampshire presidential primaryTuesday, moving to the front of the Democratic field with thebacking of his neighbors.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri _ the winner last week in theIowa caucuses _ held onto the No. 2 spot, besting Sen. Paul Simonof Illinois for the second time in a row.   ``It's really a great victory in many ways,'' Dukakis said,``because these are the people who know me best and they had totest me, not as neighbor, but as a presidential candidate.   ``It's just a terrific boost. Obviously, it's going to be veryimportant as we go into the South and the Middle West,'' he said.   But the Massachusetts governor would not claim thefront-runner's crown: ``I'm wary of that label.''   With all precincts reporting, Dukakis had 36 percent, Gephardt20 percent and Simon 17 percent.   Further back were Jesse Jackson at 8 percent, Sen. Albert GoreJr. of Tennessee at 7 percent, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt at5 percent and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado at 4 percent.   Gephardt said he did well across the state, exaggerating hisshowing a bit by claiming, ``The only thing we didn't carry was theBoston suburbs.''   ``About a week ago, they said we couldn't compete in NewHampshire,'' Gephardt said. Now, he declared, ``It appears thatwe've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest of the country, butthat could change.''   And the Missouri congressman said money is not a problem.   ``We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said. ``We are goingto be fine for Super Tuesday.''   That was not the case for Simon, whose campaign was alrady$500,000 in debt before the primary.   ``This is not helping,'' Simon said. ``From the financial pointof view, if I were 3 percentage points ahead instead of 3 pointsbehind, it would make a huge difference in collecting money.''   Babbitt was next-to-last and Hart last, but both refused to endtheir campaigns.   ``This nomination is not won in one week or 30 days, it's goingto be a six-month campaign,'' said Hart, who won New Hampshire in1984.   Hart, who re-entered the race saying ``let the voters decide,''admitted he would have to start doing better: ``It will take atleast 30 to 60 days to determine whether or not I can put togethera viable candidacy.''   Asked if he was going to withdraw, Babbitt said, ``No way. I'mgoing to move on to Washington in a couple of days and call andtalk to my supporters all over the country and ask them thisquestion: how ... can we keep this reform movement alive? Should Iwage a guerilla campaign or should I withdraw or do something else?''   Jackson said he was satisfied with his showing here. ``Ourmessage has won... They outspent me 10-to-1. And yet a poorcampaign, a rich message has been successful in New Hampshire,'' hesaid.   Gore said he did better than anticipated in New Hampshire andhad no regrets about doing little campaigning there.   ``We made a decision not to spent a million dollars on two orthree delegates. We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here inthe Super Tuesday states,'' Gore said in Houston. He was the onlycandidate who wasn't in New Hampshire Tuesday night.   Simon and Gephardt had been concentrating their fire on eachother until the final weekend, when both switched to ads attackingDukakis.   ``I haven't been watching a lot of television lately, but I'mtold people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me,''Dukakis said. ``I assume that's going to take its toll.''   Dukakis was angered at Simon's ad, which suggested he is atechnocrat who doesn't care about people. Simon ``obviously doesnot know what he's talking about,'' Dukakis said.</TEXT></DOC>
