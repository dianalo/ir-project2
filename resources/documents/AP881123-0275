Petroleum prices, which had fluctuated wildly in the previoussession on conflicting reports about the progress of the talks,turned in another erratic performance before settling slightlyhigher. U.S. markets closed early for the Thanksgiving Day holidayand were not scheduled to reopen until Monday.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said thecartel ``is working towards'' an agreement in small bilateral andmultilateral sessions.   He also indicated that a dispute between Iran and Iraq, one ofthe main stumbling blocks to an agreement, had yet to be resolved.   On Tuesday, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, rocketed up $1.42 a barrel from the previousday's close Tuesday after Iran's oil minister sounded an optimisticnote about prospects for a new agreement at OPEC's ongoing winterconference. Talks resume today.   But after hitting a high of $14.40 a barrel for the near-monthcontract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price tumbled oncethe minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, left a meeting with other OPECofficials empty-handed.   ``There has been no progress,'' said a senior member of an OPECdelegation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   After falling more than $1 off the day's high, West TexasIntermediate rebounded to finish at $13.86 a barrel, up 88 centsfrom Monday's close.   In early trading today, prices were up more than 40 cents, withthe near-term contract trading at $14.32 a barrel, up 46 cents.   Earlier, OPEC oil ministers had said they would delay for severalhours today's formal talks in an apparent effort to give them moretime to try to work out a new production accord.   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told reporters the formalsession of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wouldresume in early evening Vienna time. The meeting had beententatively scheduled for an earlier start.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is attemptingto curtail its overproduction and lift weak crude prices. The talkshave been stalled by a dispute between Iran and Iraq over how muchoil each will be allowed to produce under any new pact.   Iraq has insisted on having the same, higher quota as Iran, butIran has refused.   Aghazadeh repeated his opposition to such a deal Tuesday after anearly hour-long meeting with ministers from Venezuela, Nigeria,Algeria and Indonesia, and said he would ``never concede to parity.''   Aghazadeh said no single proposal was on the table, but heintended to remain at the talks.   Oil futures had soared around midday after Aghazadeh, in responseto reporters' questions, said, ``I think we can reach an agreement.''   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister,said ``We will not end without an agreement.''   Aghazadeh wants Iran's share of total OPEC output maintained atthe current level of 13.5 percent, the second-largest after SaudiArabia's 25.6 percent, and said that demand was firm.   Iraq's share in the current production accord, worked out in1986, is third largest at 11.7 percent.   The new production agreement would set a ceiling on 1989production.   The current accord caps OPEC's total output at about 15 millionbarrels a day. A senior member of one delegation, who demandedanonymity, said a consensus appeared to be building for a newceiling of about 18.5 million barrels a day.   Analysts estimate OPEC production soared to about 21 millionbarrels in October, reflecting the production that has caused aworldwide glut and depressed prices.   Most countries, analysts say, have been exceeding their quotas inrecent months.   Under the current accord, Iran has a quota of 2.4 million barrelsa day. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million, which it has refusedto accept.   OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates,Venezuela, Ecuador, Kuwait, Libya, Gabon, Indonesia, Algeria,Nigeria and Qatar.</TEXT></DOC>
