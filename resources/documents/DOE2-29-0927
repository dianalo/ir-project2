<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-29-0927 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for simulating the motion of two stages in a booster system described.The analysis of the motion considers both the separation and independentmotion of the two stages. During separation, the stages may be pushedapart through a combination of thrusters and springs. A guide which isassumed frictionless and in perfect sliding contact partially restrictsrelative motion between the stages during separation. Throughout themotion, time-dependent forces that are specified beforehand may be appliedto either of the stages. Equations of motion are numerically integratedin the computer program RIBS, which may be used to assist in the evaluationof different designs and deployment options. The input file and outputoptions for RIBS are described in detail in this report and example problemsprovided. 3 refs., 15 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
