The performance, set for July 21 at Patzdamer Platz near thesite of the Brandenburg Gate, will feature the construction anddemolition of a 80-foot-tall, 600-foot-long wall.   The concert will launch a five-year campaign to raise $800million for the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief, said foundingmember Roger Waters.   ``I want Russians, Germans, Americans building the wall andtearing it down, as a symbolic act of collaboration and the aims ofthe Memorial Fund,'' Waters said by telephone from London.   The group wants to get ``the armed forces freed to do disasterrelief work when they have time off from training or polishingtheir boots,'' Waters said.   The movie version of ``The Wall,'' a story of a troubled rockstar, was released in 1979 and is based on the band's album. Some19 million albums were sold worldwide.   Due to join Waters on stage in Berlin are Sinead O'Connor, VanMorrison, Thomas Dolby, The Band, Bryan Adams, The Scorpions, theEast Berlin Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, and the East Berlin RadioChoir.</TEXT></DOC>
