Mr. Walsh yesterday confirmed reports that other lawyers at Crowe andamp; Dunlevy, an Oklahoma City law firm with which he remains associated, helped Southern Air Transport purchase aircraft in 1985 and 1986. The reports were first broadcast by an Oklahoma City radio station.    Mr. Walsh said he didn't learn about Crowe andamp; Dunlevy's connection with Southern Air until reporters brought it to his attention in the past few days. He said the firm's work involved routine title transfers and didn't pose any &quot;conflict of interest at all&quot; with his continuing criminal inquiry.    While Crowe andamp; Dunlevy was paid by Southern Air to perform title searches on three planes, Mr. Walsh said in an interview that in each instance the firm was chosen by the lender and didn't have any &quot;ongoing relationship&quot; with the airline.    But if he had known about the connection earlier, Mr. Walsh acknowledged, &quot;I would have disclosed it to the FBI&quot; during the agency's background investigation of him.    A spokeswoman for Mr. Walsh said he continues to serve as counsel to Crowe andamp; Dunlevy, which means he isn't a partner in the firm and doesn't share in its profits. Nevertheless, the firm's connections with Southern Air may provide new ammunition for defense attorneys challenging the legality and propriety of Mr. Walsh's investigation.    Preston Gaddis, the partner identified by the radio station as submitting some of the registration documents filed with the Federal Aviation Administration, said Crowe andamp; Dunlevy routinely handles such transactions for &quot;most of the major air carriers.&quot;    But according to Mr. Gaddis, the firm is &quot;virtually never involved&quot; in the details of negotiations between the purchasers and sellers of aircraft. &quot;We file (registration documents) with the FAA when we're instructed to,&quot; he said in an interview.    Mr. Gaddis also said he &quot;had virtually no contact&quot; with Mr. Walsh at the firm, never discussed the matter with him, and knows &quot;nothing about who owns the stock of Southern Air.&quot; Furthermore, he said he didn't know whether two of the Boeing 707s later were used to ferry arms to Iran, as investigators suspect. </TEXT></DOC>
