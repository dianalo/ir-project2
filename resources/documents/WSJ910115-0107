Boasting one million men, Iraq's military force is theworld's fifth-largest. Its fighting style is derived frompre-World War II British field manuals, thousands of Sovietadvisers and bitter lessons learned during the gruelingeight-year war with Iran. It relies on strong defenses,long-suffering soldiers and officers who can quickly adapt tochaotic situations.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. analysts believe that, given the nature of Iraq'sforces and the way they are configured, Saddam Hussein hasprecious few military options right now. The main one issimply to stay where he is and fight defensively, counting onhis deeply dug-in army to survive the expected massive alliedair strikes and then inflict major casualties on anysubsequent ground assault.   As perilous as that course would be, the Iraqi leader'sother military choices are even more dangerous. A pre-emptivestrike against allied units facing him across the Saudiborder is possible, but U.S. officials believe that would besuicidal because Iraq lacks the air power to protectadvancing ground forces. An early attack on Israel, while itcould upset the delicate political balance of the alliancearrayed against Iraq, would surely draw an immediate anddevastating response. And withdrawing from Kuwait without anagreement from allied forces not to attack would be risky,exposing his army to the full force of allied air power.   One of the keys to Iraq's strength, according to AnthonyH. Cordesman, author of a book on the Iraq-Iran war, lies ina well-educated officer corps that includes many engineeringgraduates. &quot;Their overall skill levels are very high,&quot; hesays.   They will need those skills. U.S. air power is poised toflatten much of Iraq's elaborately engineered defense worksin the desert. Once the pace of combat quickens, Iraq willhave to struggle to keep its arsenal of sophisticated butoften incompatible weapons functioning. Those weapons werepurchased from around the world, with the Soviet Union andFrance among the leading contributors, and the flow of spareparts from abroad has stopped.   Among Iraq's other problems, according to Mr. Cordesman,are that it has never before fought a major air power, or anarmy that can match its formidable collection of artillery.&quot;Moreover, they've never had to fight at night against anopponent that can see into their lines,&quot; he adds.   Iraq's intelligence and its air force are among theweakest links in the chain of military force guarding itssouthern defenses. The U.S., watching by satellite andthrough airborne radar systems, can observe most Iraqi moves.For the most part, Iraq will be fighting on the instincts andguile of its supreme commander, Saddam Hussein.   His first line of defense will be his air force, rated byMr. Cordesman and Pentagon experts as having excellentfighter planes, primarily French Mirage-1s and SovietMiG-29s. Iraqi pilots, however, performed poorly during theIranian war, preferring to drop their bombs -- ofteninaccurately -- from the safety of high altitudes out of thereach of anti-aircraft fire.   They also shunned dogfights. A recent House Armed ServicesCommittee report suggests that Iraqi pilots have shown &quot;amarked reluctance to engage in air-defense and counter-airoperations.&quot; The U.S. hopes to destroy much of the Iraqi AirForce on the ground, but officials acknowledge that may bedifficult because of steps the Iraqis have taken, such asconstructing special hangars designed to withstand theexpected bombing. The next best thing to destroying theplanes would be to prevent them from taking off; to that end,the U.S. will seek to crater runways with &quot;Gators,&quot; magneticmines that linger and explode when aircraft approach. Planesthat escape aloft are not likely to last long.   Iraq's ground-based air-defense systems, according to aPentagon expert who asked not to be identified, will havemore staying power -- and more killing power. They includealmost the entire family of Soviet surface-to-air missiles,ranging from copies of the U.S. Stinger to missilesspecifically designed to shoot down B-52s and to resistsophisticated U.S. jamming efforts. U.S. pilots have so muchrespect for these weapons that one of them, the SA-8, isknown as the &quot;Evil Eye.&quot; Iraq also has more than 4,000anti-aircraft guns.   The Armed Services Committee report estimates that theU.S. and its allies could initially lose 10 or more planes aday. But that report, as well as most other U.S. estimates,suggests that the Iraqis will quickly lose control of theairspace over Kuwait and Iraq.   On the ground, Iraqi soldiers showed during the Iranianwar that they were capable of withstanding some savageIranian human-wave attacks -- and responding ruthlessly. OneIranian charge through a shallow lake was stopped when Iraqiengineers dropped electric lines in the water, frying theIranians, as one put it, &quot;like so many fish.&quot;   But Iraqi troops have never experienced the devastation ofa heavy and precise air attack from the as many as 2,000bomber sorties a day that the U.S. and its allies arepreparing to deliver.   Iraqi fighting doctrine calls for a lot of waiting. &quot;Theydig in and wait for the big battle,&quot; explains Lt. Col.Patrick Sweeney, operations officer for an artillery brigadewith the U.S. Army's 18th Airborne Corps. The set-piecebattle plan served Iraq well during the war with Iran, whereSaddam Hussein's centralized controls could reach hisofficers.   This time, though, a major question is how long the troopscan endure amid the corpses and debris of bombing after thecommunications from central command go dead. Unlike Col.Sweeney's unit, which enjoys hot showers and hot meals, Iraqisoldiers have been sitting in the bleak Kuwaiti desert forfive months at the end of a supply line that, reportedly,often can't deliver enough water or food. The Armed Servicesreport notes that &quot;comments by several recently returnedWesterners from Kuwait suggested that Iraqi soldiers appearedmore battle-weary than battle-tested.&quot;   But if Iraq's supply lines may be short on creaturecomforts, it still has a &quot;huge overstock&quot; of spare parts andammunition, according to Mr. Cordesman. Stockpiling was oneof the ways Saddam Hussein coped with embargoes slapped onIraq during the Iran-Iraq war; at the time of the August 1988cease-fire, Mr. Cordesman says, Iraq still had enoughsupplies to fight on another year, and since then it hasbought at least $3 billion more.   The question is whether even that is enough. BecauseIraq's weaponry was accumulated from so many differentsources -- its lines bristle with 4,000 Soviet-made andBritish-made tanks, and Soviet, U.S., French, British andBrazilian armored personnel carriers -- it must maintainmultiple inventories of parts, and no one, perhaps includingthe Iraqis themselves, knows how much they need.   Most Iraqi soldiers -- the most recent arrivals aremiddle-aged men and 17-year-old boys -- live in bunkers in afortified zone 18 miles wide along Kuwait's southern border.Much of Iraq's armor is also dug deeply into fortifiedbarriers. More mobile reserve forces, including Iraq's eliteRepublican Guards, wait behind the network of sand berms,bunkers, oil-filled ditches, mines and barbed wire.   One of the many ironies in this conflict is that most U.S.soldiers have been trained to fight in barren, lifelessdesert conditions similar to southern Kuwait; but most Iraqiveterans, according to Mr. Cordesman, haven't been, becausemost of the fighting with Iran occurred in the humid, lushriver lowlands of southern Iraq.   Moreover, stuck in their Maginot-like fortifications,Iraqi soldiers have great difficulty moving units orartillery fire to cope with an enemy who maneuvers. &quot;Oncetheir lines are penetrated out there, they become instantprisoner-of-war material,&quot; says Mr. Cordesman.   The biggest unanswered questions about Iraq's forces haveconcerned potential chemical and nuclear capabilities.   Much has been written about Iraq's chemical-weaponscapability, but the Armed Services Committee report says thatremains a question mark. After listening to a battery ofwitnesses, the report concludes that &quot;in a hot desertenvironment, chemical agents dissipate fairly quickly and arerelatively limited in their casualty effects.&quot;   Even more unclear is the result of Iraq's considerableefforts to build a nuclear warhead. Iraq possesses a systemable to deliver a nuclear warhead: its arsenal of SovietScud-B missiles, relatively inaccurate 1950s-era weapons thatwere originally designed for nuclear warheads. DespitePresident Bush's fresh concern that Iraqi nuclear capabilitymay be less than a year away, though, most experts don'tthink so. That belief is based on the partial steps Iraq hastaken toward manufacturing the key nuclear materials, eitherplutonium or highly enriched uranium, that are needed to makea bomb.   But, lured by Iraq's oil money, much secret Westerntechnology and many Western-educated techno-mercenaries havealready seeped through the leaky net of restrictions theindustrial nations have created to stop the flow of chemicaland nuclear technology. As a result, no one can really saythat Iraq may not have been able to buy the key componentsfor a bomb abroad -- something they have been trying to dosince 1982, says Paul L. Leventhal, head of theWashington-based Nuclear Control Institute.   &quot;If Saddam assembles a secret store of bomb material,&quot;says Mr. Leventhal, &quot;we would be foolhardy to assume that hisscientists lack the wherewithal to explode nuclear weapons.&quot;   ---   Andy Pasztor in Saudi Arabia contributed to this article.   ---                         Iraqi Forces                                                                                                        ARMED SERVICES                           1 MILLION MEN TANKS                                            5,500 OTHER ARMORED VEHICLES                           9,600 ARTILLERY PIECES                                 3,500 HELICOPTERS                                        489 ATTACK AIRCRAFT                                    360 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT                                   275                                                                                                          Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies</TEXT></DOC>
