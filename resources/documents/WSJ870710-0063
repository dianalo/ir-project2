The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 12.76 points at 2451.21. But much of that decline came in the session's final half hour, when buying pressure evaporated, traders said.    &quot;The market has sort of paused here,&quot; said Gerald Simmons, a managing director in the equity trading department at Smith Barney Harris Upham. &quot;I think it's because the market was up so much over the past couple of days.&quot; The industrial average rose a total of more than 34 points in the previous two sessions.    Mr. Simmons said the market lacked direction, and investors hope to get some from today's report on the June producer price index. In addition, he said, many investors are anxiously waiting to see companies' second-quarter earnings reports, many of which are due to be released starting next week.    Broader market indexes also ended lower, with Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index off 0.77 to 307.52 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index down 0.27 at 173.15.    But advancing issues wound up with a small lead over decliners on the Big Board, 819 to 756. The trading pace was active for most of the session, and Big Board volume totaled 195.4 million shares, compared with 207.5 million shares Wednesday.    The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index closed at a record for the third consecutive day, rising 0.22 to 346.79.    Such recent big gainers as oil company shares and stocks tied to takeover or restructuring rumors were generally lower.    Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg Thalmann in New York, said, &quot;They were the primary leadership of the market over the past couple of days. With bonds down and nothing else to go on, it's going to be difficult for people to figure out where to put their money.&quot;    For the short term, Mr. Groveman believes the market could be in for some down days. &quot;The market needs something to drive it, whether it be takeovers or strong bonds. People need themes to trade on, and unless there's a theme to act on, usually the course of least resistance is down,&quot; he said.    Noting yesterday's decline in many &quot;rumor stocks,&quot; Mr. Groveman said, &quot;I think the market is unattractive right now because there is nothing left to exploit.&quot;    Oil company shares, in fact, were generally lower despite a surge in crude oil futures prices, which closed above $21 a barrel for the first time in nearly 18 months. The jump was caused by an escalation of tensions in the Middle East. Early yesterday an Iranian gunboat attacked a U.S.-operated supertanker in the Persian Gulf.    Exxon fell 1/2 to 94 3/8, Mobil slid 1/8 to 52, Atlantic Richfield was down 1/4 to 97 5/8, Amoco fell 1/4 to 89 1/8, and Chevron declined 1/8 to 62 1/2. But Phillips Petroleum rose 3/8 to 17 7/8, and British Petroleum edged up 1/4 to 79 1/4.    Oil field equipment and service stocks rose. One New York-based trader said these companies could benefit if there were a disruption in the flow of oil from the Middle East.    Steel stocks edged higher after posting bigger gains Wednesday, with Armco up 1/4 to 11 3/8, Bethlehem Steel up 1/2 to 17 1/2, and National Intergroup up 1/4 to 18 1/2. Inland Steel ended unchanged at 31 1/2 after trading as high as 33.    Analysts said there isn't any specific reason to explain this week's gains in steel stocks, but they agree the industry's fundamentals are stronger. Michelle Galanter Applebaum, metals analyst at Salomon Brothers, speculated that &quot;often at the beginning of the quarter, out-of-favor stocks will pick up. The last time this happened in steel was April.&quot;    Mrs. Applebaum said, &quot;No one thing is terrific in steel, but a lot of small good things have been happening.&quot; Steel supplies have decreased since the strike last summer at USX, so steel makers have been able to increase prices a bit, she said. In addition, the lower dollar has helped, as have import quotas on most foreign sources of steel. Industrywide cost-cutting is another big factor, she added.    Southland Corp. rose 1 1/2 to 78 on heavy volume. There was speculation another bidder may surface for the company, which has agreed to be acquired for $77 a share.    Some shares of companies that were considered restructuring or takeover candidates were hit by profit-taking.    One was Burlington Northern, which declined 1 to 82 1/2. The railroad concern reported a second-quarter profit of $74.3 million, or 99 cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier.    Reichhold Chemicals fell 5/8 to 63 3/8. The company said it would give unwanted suitor Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals a look at information provided to other potential acquirers. In return, Dainippon extended its $473 million bid for Reichhold. But Dainippon also filed a lawsuit against Reichhold, seeking to invalidate an anti-takeover measure.    Reichhold is one of the takeover and restructuring stocks in Teledyne Chairman Henry Singleton's portfolio, which some investors have been latching on to for its speculative possibilities. Kidde, another Singleton holding, gained 1/8 to 61 5/8.    Teledyne, however, fell 4 3/4 to 372 1/4 after gaining earlier this week. Two other stocks in which Teledyne has a stake declined after recent gains. Litton Industries was off 2 7/8 to 103 1/8, and Curtiss-Wright fell 3/4 to 66 3/4.    Lockheed, which had also gone up on takeover and restructuring rumors, slipped 1 3/4 to 55 5/8.    Golden Nugget advanced 1 5/8 to 13 1/2 in heavy trading. New York real estate developer Donald Trump said he holds a 4.9% stake in the casino company and hinted he may seek control.    Consolidated Rail rose 3/8 to 33 1/4, and Computer Associates was up 5/8 to 24 1/8; both companies were added to the list of stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 index. When a company is added to a major index, its share price usually rises because money managers basing their portfolios on the index buy the shares.    GTE was up 5/8 to 38 7/8, and United Telecommunications gained 1/8 to 27 3/4. The two companies, partners in U.S. Sprint, said Sprint will take a pre-tax charge of about $350 million for the second quarter. GTE said its portion of the charge will be partially offset by pension settlement gains, resulting in an after-tax charge of $55 million. United Telecommunications said its share of the charge will result in a $109 million charge for the quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
