Gerald Fisher, an attorney for the 17-year-old boy identifiedonly by the initials O.M., urged a three-judge panel of the courtFriday to overturn a lower court ruling that Alabama's extraditionbid must be honored.   Fisher said the district government's death penalty prohibitionmust override its obligation under the Interstate Compact onJuveniles, the agreement which requires states to honor eachother's extradition requests for juveniles.   But Edward Schwab, assistant corporation counsel for thedistrict government, said the interstate compact does not give thedistrict the discretion to impose its anti-death penalty policy onAlabama or any other state.   The three-judge panel court did not indicate when it would rule,although it agreed in March to handle the case on an expeditedbasis.   O.M. was arrested by district police last December on juvenilecharges of arson and murder stemming from a May 1988 firebombing inGadsden, Ala., which killed 14-month-old Tamel Jackson. His uncle,Yul Devoe Guice, 31, also has been charged with arson and murder inthe case.   O.M.'s lawyers contend the youth, who is black, will not betreated fairly the all-white judicial system in Gadsden.   District City Councilwoman Wilhelmina Rolark, chairman of thecouncil's judiciary committee, has introduced emergency legislationto prohibit the district from extraditing any juvenile facing apotential death sentence unless the state involved certifies thatit will not seek the death penalty. A hearing on her bill is setfor Tuesday.   During Friday's hearing, James Klein, another attorney for O.M.,argued that the interstate compact is not valid in the districtbecause its ratification papers never were published in cityregulations, as required by a 1984 district law.   One judge indicated that Klein's argument might providesufficient grounds to overturn the order that O.M. be returned toAlabama.   The Supreme Court is expected to rule in July whether imposingthe death sentence on murderers who commit their crimes before age18 violates the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusualpunishment.''</TEXT></DOC>
