However, the lasers operate at half the Ektaplus' speed, have lessmemory than the Ektaplus' 2 megabytes, cannot work as copiers and cannot workwith a variety of printer and page description languages.;    For anadditional $1,500, Kodak offers the Ektaplus 7016PS, which includes an AdobePostScript co-processor board with 4 megabytes of memory and a Motorola 68020microprocessor. Kodak says this setup will greatly speed the printing ofcomplex PostScript documents.;    &quot;For the price, it's a very good deal,&quot; saidMarc G. Boer, an analyst with the research and consulting firm BiscapInternational of Norwell, Mass. Boer said beating the competition to acopier-printer combination was a &quot;really smart move on Kodak's part.&quot;;   Other companies better known in the printer business, includingHewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto and Texas Instruments Inc. of Richardson,Texas, are expected to weigh in soon with their own network printers --probably at lower cost but almost certainly without the copier feature.;    &quot;Iexpect there will be more,&quot; said Michael V. Howard, a network analyst withInfonetics Research Institute Inc. of San Jose.;    Office laser printers,including H-P's best-selling LaserJet, are typically attached to a local areanetwork through a dedicated personal computer called a print server. Theserver functions as a traffic cop, managing print requests from users on asingle network.;    The Ektaplus, in theory, does not require a dedicatedserver. It can manage traffic from as many as four lanes at once.;    &quot;It'snot just network-capable, it's networks, plural, capable,&quot; said Howard ofInfonetics. &quot;You can have four different kinds of networks attached at once.&quot;;   The current generation of laser printers was designed to serve individualusers, not groups of workers. As more companies install local area networks,however, heavy-duty printers are needed.;    &quot;The key characteristics ofnetwork printers are higher speeds, but more important, higher duty cycles,&quot;said Jonathan Seybold, president of Seybold Seminars of Malibu. &quot;Networkprinters also require significantly improved paper handling, the ability tocope with multiple languages and the ability to run off networks.&quot;;    Today'smost popular laser printers operate at speeds of four or eight pages a minute,but new generations are expected to reach the market soon with speeds of 16 to20 pages a minute.;    The higher speeds will be needed to keep waiting linesshort when the printers are shared by many users. (For really short lines,some companies choose even faster printers. Kodak already makes a92-page-a-minute electrophotographic PostScript printer, but it costs at least$100,000 more than the new Ektaplus 7016.);    Kodak's new Ektaplus is an LEDprinter, using a light-emitting diode, and it differs from laser printers inseveral ways, though not in the finished look of the printed page.;    In alaser printer, a small laser beam flashes off a spinning mirror and &quot;writes&quot;its image on a rotating drum. In an LED printer, the complex laser and mirrorsystem is replaced by a semiconductor diode that glows when it is charged.;   The printer-copier has only 20 parts, all replaceable by a field technician,and Kodak promises that no service call will last more than 30 minutes. Thatis good news for an office that depends on paper.;    Kodak says the Ektaplus7016 has a duty cycle of 15,000 pages a month, or about 750 sheets a day foran average 20-day work month. Unlike printers that send a page around internalrollers, the Kodak's paper path is short and straight, reducing the likelihoodof paper jams and breakdowns.;    A potential drawback is that the device hasa 100-sheet output tray. The printer-copier has two paper trays with acapacity of 250 sheets each feeding the output tray. Legal paper size isavailable as an option.;    A particularly nice touch is the control panel,which tells the user in English if the printer is out of paper or there issome other problem -- instead of signaling some obscure error code that no oneremembers.;    For people who want to make a photocopy or two -- at 10 secondsa copy this feature is designed merely for convenience, not for big copyingjobs -- the Ektaplus interrupts the network printing queue temporarily. Thenit picks up where it left off.;    The Ektaplus is ambitious in its automatichandling of a variety of common printer and page description languages,including HP-PCL (LaserJet), HP-GL (plotter), Epson FX-80, Diablo 630 and IBMProprinter, plus PostScript.;    The Ektaplus comes with special software thatcan be loaded into network computers to tag each print request with a languagerequest. This enables the printer to change emulation on the fly.;    Untilnow, the only office printer able to adapt to commands from a PC or a Mac, forinstance, was the $2,795 QMS 410, a four-page-a-minute laser from QMS Inc. ofMobile, Ala.;    &quot;The reason for multiple languages is that an increasingnumber of users are working in a heterogenous environment,&quot; Seybold said.&quot;They want the ability to send a document from the desk top to the printer andnot have to worry about what language the printer is running or how it isconfigured.&quot;;    While the Ektaplus is better suited for network applicationsthan other printers today, there is room for improvement. Several forthcomingprinters are expected to attach directly to a network through a built-inEthernet board or some other arrangement, instead of through parallel orserial ports as the Ektaplus does.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PETER H.
