It has been found in the United States only inparts of North Carolina and South Carolina. The witchweed quarantine and regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.80 <T3>et seq., </T3>and referred to below as the regulations) quarantinethe states of North Carolina and South Carolina and restrict the interstatemovement of certain witchweed hosts from regulated areas in the quarantinedstates for the purpose of preventing the artificial spread of witchweed.Regulated areas for witchweed are designated as either suppressive areasor generally infested areas. Restrictions are imposed on the interstatemovement of regulated articles from both in order to prevent the artificialmovement of witchweed into noninfested areas. However, the eradicationof witchweed is undertaken as an objective only in places designated assuppressive areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">Designation of Areas as Suppressive Areas </ITAG>We are amending the list of suppressive areas by adding areas in Beaufort,Duplin, Greene, Hoke, and Sampson Counties in North Carolina, and FlorenceCounty in South Carolina to the list of suppressive areas in andSection;301.80-2a of the regulations. Surveys conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture and Stateagencies of North Carolina and South Carolina establish that witchweedhas spread, or is likely to spread, to certain areas beyond the outer perimeterof areas previously designated as suppressive areas. Therefore, those additionalareas in these counties in North Carolina and South Carolina, which werepreviously nonregulated areas, are designated as witchweed suppressiveareas. We are taking this action in order to prevent the spread of witchweedand to facilitate its eradication. <ITAG tagnum="84">Deletion of Areas From List of Regulated Areas </ITAG>We are also amending the list of suppressive areas by deleting areas inCraven, Cumberland, Duplin, Hoke, Lenoir, Richmond, Scotland, and WayneCounties in North Carolina, and Florence, Horry, and Marlboro Countiesin South Carolina in andSection; 301.80-2a of the regulations. We are taking this action because we have determined that witchweed nolonger occurs in these areas and there is no longer a basis to continuelisting these areas as suppressive areas for the purpose of preventingthe artificial spread of witchweed. Therefore, we are deleting these areasfrom the list of suppressive areas in order to remove unnecessary restrictionson the movement of articles designated as witchweed regulated articles.The regulations list the suppressive areas for each county. Non-farm areas,if any, are listed first; farms are then listed alphabetically. <ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that an emergency situation exists, that warrantspublication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment.Because of the possibility that witchweed could be spread artificiallyto noninfested areas of the United States, a situation exists requiringimmediate action to control the spread of this pest. Also, where witchweedno longer occurs, immediate action is needed to delete unnecessary restrictionson the interstate movement of regulated articles. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under thesecircumstances, and because this rule relieves a regulatory restriction,there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 533 for making it effective upon publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. We will consider comments postmarked or receivedwithin 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Any amendments we make to this interim ruleas a result of these comments, and a discussion of the comments received,will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as soon as possible following the close of thecomment period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean estimated annual effect on the economy of less than $4,000; will notcause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwill not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromspecified areas in North Carolina and South Carolina. Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that approximately 281,000small entities move these articles interstate from North Carolina and SouthCarolina. However, this action affects only 172 of these entities by removing164 entities from regulation and placing 8 new entities under regulation.We have determined that the 164 deregulated entities will realize combinedannual savings of approximately $3,800, or $23.17 each, in regulatory andcontrol costs. We estimate that the 8 newly regulated entities will needto invest a similar amount, approximately $23 each, per year, in orderto comply with our regulations. We therefore estimate that the overallimpact from this action will be less than $4,000. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>The program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This interim rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 </ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture), Quarantine,Transportation, Witchweed.Accordingly, we are amending 7 CFR Part 301 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES </ITAG>1.
