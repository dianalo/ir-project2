Ends Tests@  Of Products on Animals </HL><DD> 08/21/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> HOUSEHOLD AND PERSONAL-CARE PRODUCTS (HHP) </IN><DATELINE> ADA, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amway Corp. said it has ended all animal tests, replacing them with in-vitro testing methods.    The closely held consumer product company's move follows by about a month announcements by Revlon Inc. and Avon Products Inc. that they would stop using animals in tests of products.    In a joint statement with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal advocacy group, Amway said its decision &quot;follows a rigorous campaign by the {group} to have all companies involved in animal testing end the practice.&quot;    Amway said it won't perform animal tests itself, nor will it have animal tests done for it by others. The company said it recently decided not to introduce a new pesticide because it would have had to submit animal tests to the Environmental Protection Agency to get approval for the pesticide. </TEXT></DOC>
