(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A little critter that's been dead for300 million years is being given new life in the Illinois GeneralAssembly.   Lawmakers this session are pondering a measure to designate theprehistoric animal called the Tullimonstrom gregarium _ knownunofficially as the Tully monster _ as the state's official fossil.   ``The thing that's significant about the Tully monster is thatit's indigenous to Illinois,'' said Rep. Larry Wennlund.   ``If you look at the other state symbols _ the cardinal,violets, even the monarch butterfly _ they can be found all overthe country,'' he said.   The Tully monster is named for Lockport pipefitter FrancisTully, who discovered its fossilized remains in 1958 among slagheaps south of Braidwood, about 55 miles southwest of Chicago.   Tully died two years ago, but his son, Dan, said it would be a``tremendous honor'' to have his father's discovery recognized bythe state.   The Tully monster grew to about 1long, had a tube-like body witha spade-shaped tail and sported two tentacle-like sensors or eyesand a snout that of an elephant.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a ...blimp?   At first glance, the senior desi Tennessee at Chattanooga'sSchool of Engineering doesn't look revolutionary.   The students' 28-foot blimp looks like a mini-version of theGoodyear model that's been honas since before the first Super Bowl.   But they say their project could save money for utilities likeChattanooga's Electric Power Board as a way to monitor power linesfor heat loss and other problemde of garbage-bag plastic hung on abalsa and plywood frame, the blimp is powered by two radio-ntrolledmotors. An infrared camera near the front base, also red, surveyspower lines for about a third of the cost of helicopters, said Janns, assistant engineering profe project coordinator.   The blimp gets its first test Thursday when the students willcheck its flying, turnpeed capabilities.   ``If it n't work, we've got to make it wsaid Greg Phillips, acivil engineering major. ``They have told us we won't grduate if itdoesn't work.   `on't know if they were joking or they were serious. ... So,yes, it will fly.''</TEXT></DOC>
