Rubin's recent rejection of the GE-Justice Department's proposed sweetheart settlement of this case.    Judge Rubin's overruling of the magistrate's report was not based on what Mr. Handros calls a &quot;legal technicality.&quot; The now-defunct report erroneously overlooked the applicable law-amendments to the False Claims Act passed in 1986.    Not only was the magistrate's report not based on the applicable law, but also it was not supported by any evidentiary hearing or the live testimony of any witnesses. In contrast, Judge Rubin's decision was based upon a two-day evidentiary hearing and the testimony of the chief investigator of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Based on the evidence, Judge Rubin determined:   1) That the Justice Department's conduct in this case was highly questionable. The judge wrote that &quot;the Department of Justice took no deposition, interviewed no witness and instead confined its efforts to opposing all attempts by plaintiff's {Mr. Gravitt's} counsel to conduct appropriate discovery.&quot;    2) That the Justice Department refused to grant immunity from prosecution to a GE official with first-hand knowledge of the false-vouchering scheme, even though &quot;the United States admitted that there was no criminal prosecution pending nor was any contemplated&quot; and, as a result, the witness asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, thereby blocking important discovery.    3) That &quot;from a totality of the proceedings thus far,&quot; the proposed $234,000 settlement was &quot;inadequate.&quot;    Judge Rubin's rejection of the magistrate's report was appealed by both GE and the Justice Department. These appeals were rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The case is now pending again before Judge Rubin for trial.    Mr. Handros also neglects to inform you that GE has admitted in this case that thousands of labor vouchers at its Evendale facility were facially altered and contained false entries. GE's justification is that somehow this fraud hurt only GE and not the government. GE's stockholders certainly will not be happy to hear that these labor-vouchering procedures have not only run afoul of federal defense contracting anti-fraud laws, but, according to GE's lawyers, have cheated the company.    Your article regarding Mr. Gravitt's courageous stand against one of the world's largest corporations and in spite of the obstructions, interference and bungling by the Justice Department was exceedingly accurate. In light of the undisputed fact that GE employees falsified thousands of labor vouchers involving millions of dollars of government contracts, Mr. Handros should be thankful that your article was not more unfavorable to GE or to the Justice Department for their shameful handling of this matter.
