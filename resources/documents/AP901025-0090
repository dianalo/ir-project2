Fugitives on state, federal and international charges from NewZealand to Bermuda were rounded up during the 10-week effort, alongwith $12.8 million in cash, property, drugs, guns and othercontraband.   The operation marked a new level of coordination between theU.S. Marshal's Service and 28 state and local agencies in the waron drugs, said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh who reportedthe sweep Wednesday.   ``We're making considerable progress in upping the ante forthose who are intent upon feeding the appetite that unfortunatelystill exists in the United States for illegal drugs,'' he said.   But he conceded that the federal government was not in aposition to say if the operation had actually cut into drug salesin the United States.   Authorities said those arrested were tracked through 32 statesand several foreign countries.   Foreign fugitives have too long been able to ``flee from onecountry to another, financed by lucrative international criminalactivities,'' said K. Michael Moore, director of the U.S. Marshal'sService.   ``They assume that the various law enforcement officers don'thave the time or resources to track them across internationaljurisdictions. Operation Southern Star proves them wrong,'' Mooresaid.   Eleven of those arrested were wanted for murder, and one of thefugitives, Charles Bryatt, was wanted in New Zealand on charges ofcocaine smuggling and conspiracy to supply LSD.   Along with Bryant, federal authorities singled out several otherfugitives as principal targets of Southern Star.   Gregory Rodgers, wanted on a Kansas cocaine distribution charge,was tracked down in the Central American country of Belize anddeported to Miami for arrest.   One Florida fugitive, Richard Joseph Lynn, was tracked throughAlabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mexico and Guatemala beforehe was arrested at a restaurant in Gulfport, Miss.   The most prominent drug cache seized was 150 pounds of cocainethat was found underneath imported seafood on a South Americanairliner in Miami. Two days later, U.S. Customs Service inspectorsat the same airport found 100 pounds of cocaine from Lima, Peru, ina box labeled ``books.''</TEXT></DOC>
