We havealso obtained additional coal samples and have formulated test plansfor experiments to be performed. We have modified the combustor to improvereliability of start-up procedures. As in past experiments, the sandbed is preheated with LP-gas that is mixed with fluidization air in theplenum below the bed. However, we have installed electrodes above thebed that provides a continuous electrical ignition source during thepreheat period. Tests have confirmed that this modification is effectivein providing reliable combustor start-up. Two important changes havebeen made in gas and particle sampling from the combustor effluent comparedto past projects. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
