Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT FIN WNEWS </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board seized control of American Savings andamp; Loan Association as part of its plan to aid Robert M. Bass Group Inc. in acquiring the nation's second-largest thrift with $2 billion in federal aid.    By stripping the Stockton, Calif., thrift from its parent company, Financial Corp. of America, the Bank Board effectively wipes out the interests of Financial Corp.'s shareholders and debtholders and virtually assured that Financial Corp. will enter bankruptcy-law proceedings, analysts said.    Financial Corp., of Irvine, Calif., issued a statement late yesterday saying that the company's directors will meet today to &quot;consider appropriate action by FCA in light of the Bank Board action.&quot; The company declined to elaborate on the board's agenda.    Financial Corp. also said that William J. Popejoy, chairman and chief executive of both Financial Corp. and American Savings, has indicated that he will resign as chairman and chief executive officer of the parent effective at the beginning of today's board meeting.    Mr. Popejoy indicated that he will accept an offer by the Bank Board to become chief executive officer of the new federally chartered version of American Savings that the Bank Board has set up as an interim thrift until the Bass Group acquisition is completed.    Mr. Popejoy, 50 years old, was handpicked by the Bank Board in August 1984 to succeed Charles W. Knapp, then Financial Corp.'s chairman, who was forced out by the regulators.    Mr. Popejoy, who met in Washington yesterday with Bank Board officials, was flying back to California late yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment.    In setting up the new American Savings early yesterday morning, the Bank Board also injected $250 million in cash to recapitalize the thrift. The funds are, in effect, an advance on some of the assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. that has been promised to Bass Group.    Separately, part of the Bass agreement that would allow the Bass-controlled American Savings to invest $1.5 billion in leveraged buy-outs and other merchant banking activities continued to come under congressional scrutiny.    To try to defuse some criticism, Bank Board officials told the Senate Banking Committee staff that Bass Group's new thrift would be barred from financing hostile takeovers.    But the Bank Board officials were vague on details and left most questions unanswered, according to congressional staffers.    Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; over the Bank Board's decision to allow the bank to enter merchant-banking operations. Mr. St Germain issued a statement saying he will ask about the merchant bank tomorrow when Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall is due to testify.    &quot;We are trying to strengthen FSLIC, not add to the potential for new risks or banking operations that further sap the public's confidence in the industry,&quot; he said.    American Savings was Financial Corp.'s only significant operating unit. As of June 30, Financial Corp. on a standalone basis had only about $3.3 million in cash and investment securities. And a $2.9 million interest payment due Sept. 15 would nearly exhaust its liquid assets.    &quot;They're wiped out,&quot; Jerome I. Baron, a thrift analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York said of Financial Corp. &quot;The simple fact is that FCA had truly one operating subsidiary, American Savings, and that has now been seized for no compensation. There are effectively no assets at the parent,&quot; Mr. Baron said.    &quot;Any security with FCA's legend on it is wallpaper,&quot; Mr. Baron said.    Financial Corp. shares didn't trade yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's common shares, of which 36 million are outstanding, closed Friday at 75 cents each, unchanged. Other Financial Corp. securities issues outstanding include two series of preferred stock and several issues of subordinated debentures.    The debentures have a total principal amount of $77.7 million, but lately have traded at steep discount to their face value.    During the past four years, institutional investors have almost entirely abandoned Financial Corp. securities, leaving the shares and debt mostly in the hands of individuals.    As of June 30, the parent had a negative net worth of $387 million, indicating its liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount.    Theo Pitt, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a trade group, said that though he didn't know all the details of the deal, &quot;It is a tremendous relief to know that FCA has been sold.&quot; He noted that the capital attracted to this deal more than doubled the amount pledged by NCNB to take over First RepublicBank, Dallas.    ---   Robert E.
