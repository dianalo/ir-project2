CT images taken by very short scantime have less movement factor of cardiac pulsation, and demonstrateclearly and sharply lung parenchymal or interstitial diseases using specialfilter function of FC 3 and FC 4. The CT images of sixty one cases ofpneumoconiosis including profusion of 1/0, 1/1, 2/2 by the corresponding1980 International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses werereviewed to estimate the correlation with plain chest roentgenograms.The detectability of bulla, blebs, pulmonary emphysema, pleural thickening,confluent nodules, calcified nodules and pneumothorax was higher thanthe chest roentgenogram. It is noticeable that visualization of smallemphysematous lesion was far excellent on CT images. The discrepancyof these pathological findings between CT images and chest roenrgenogramwas 61 % (37/61). From the three dimensional information, CT appearsthat it will make a large contribution to roentgenological interpretation.</TEXT></DOC>
