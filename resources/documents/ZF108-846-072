 Now that the cost of DVI development tools hasplummeted from $22,000 to less than $5,000, Intel is under the gun to delivernot only a working technology but one for which development is both easy andpractical.andM;While the ActionMedia boards were still reclusive in Intel's labs, we decidedto challenge the technology by developing an application.andP;  For both thematerials and method, we went to a trio of for-thinkers, collectively calledHistor SyStems, who share a dream of creating a virtual reality in whichanyone can question and learn from prominent figures  in major disciplines.andM;Project BackgroundandM;Histor's work began about 20 years ago when Bruce Bassett, an NBC televisionproducer, began filming conversations with cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz,who lived in Paris from 1913 until the Nazi occupation and come to America in1941.andP;  After the two men met (both lived in the same New York City suburb),Bassett recognized a unique opportunity to capture o bit of history.andP;  Thestories that Lipchitz told Bassett about his artistic life and his workingparticipation with Picasso, Broque, Gris and other contemporary artists atthe beginning of the century illuminated the blossoming of cubism.andM;Bassett captured hundreds of these short recollections and insights on film,gradually assembling a mosaic of Lipchitz's experiences and beliefs.andP;  Theproducer approached IBM for help and also caught the attention of Ken Powell,then an IBM executive in charge of corporate exhibits.andP;  With Powell'sguidance, Bassett began analyzing the stories he'd collected, matingLipchitz's responses with question categories.andM;During the 1970s, Bassett persuaded New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art,Washington's Corcoran Gallery and other sites to mount exhibitions ofLipchitz's sculptures and to run the first incarnation of an interactivesystem that would enable museum-goers standing before a video display towrite a question and within moments see a film clip of Lipchitz giving theanswer.andP;  For these early demonstrations, Bassett used students runningrandom-access videotape machines to quickly fetch the responses.andM;Bassett amassed thousands of questions and classified them so that he couldmate them with categories of answers.andP;  Just four hours of carefully chosenresponses were sufficient to produce a remarkably relevant response tovirtually any question posed by a museum-goer.andM;in the early 1980s, a new combination of technologies emerged that seemed apromising platform for the Lipchitz material: an interactive laser videodiscpaired with a PC.andP;  The loser videodisc is ideal for randomly accessinghigh-quality analog video, but only a half hour of it at a time.andP;  So Bassettand Powell moved a one-hour subset of Lipchitz responses to two loservideodiscs ganged together.andP;  They also brought on Tom Nicholson, who wasresponsible for creating the interactive video displays at the Baseball Hallof Fame, to write natural-language software in C that could interpret justabout any question typed into the system.andM;The Histor project, as transferred from interactive videodisc, did notexercise any of DVI's advanced graphics and digital video processing, but itwas a suitable prototype of transfer to DVI.andP;  What's more, DVI would be aperfect complement to the Lipchitz application.andP;  A DVI playback system isself-contained and it con take the place of a cumbersome setup linkingside-by-side PC and videodisc systems.andM;The Application FormationandM;Learning the authoring system Although DVI pioneers built their applicationswith C programming, we chose an easier way, using the Authology: Multimediaauthoring system developed by CEIT Systems.andP;  Authology offered tools thatsomeone who has no programming skills could master.andM;Authology is a menu-based system that allows developers to assemble panels&quot;of video, audio, animation, titling and graphics.andP;  By ordering the panels andadding a few instructions for branching among them, it's easy to build acomplex interactive system quickly.andM;Even so, learning Authology requires a formal two-day training course atCEIT's Son Jose office or at Intel's DVI headquarters in Princeton.andP;  Andusing Authology requires a basic understanding of DVI's wide range of fileformats--there are several each for video, audio and graphics.andM;Capturing video and audio When Intel developed DVI, it set aside its plan tolet developers capture video into the system in real time.andP;  Instead, itconcentrated on perfecting the kind of high-powered compression in advancethat would squeeze 72 minutes of video onto a CD-ROM.andP;  The result was PLV(production-level video), which Intel defensively dubbed &quot;VCR quality.&quot;andM;If the only way to get video into a DVI development system were PLV, however,few developers would ever be lured to the technology.andP;  Aside from Intel's$250-per-minute base charge for PLV compression, just 30 seconds of PLV conconsume a whopping 4.5MB of hard-disk storage.andM;So a year or two after introducing DVI, Intel unveiled a for more workableapproach to getting video into a DVI development system: real-time video, orRTV.andP;  RTV delivered a do-it-yourself, affordable way to feed in video from astandard video source, perhaps a camera or VHS player.andP;  Its solution: Only 10video frames per second rather than 30 of lower-resolution video ended up inRTV hard disk files.andP;  But that was still good enough for prototyping anapplication or delivering video that doesn't require PLV quality, such asthat used for videoconferencing.andM;The newest release of RTV for the ActionMedia boards compresses a full 30frames per second in real time but gobbles more than nine times the storagespace PLV takes.andP;  The old RTV frame rate of 10 frames per second con be usedto capture more footage in the some amount of storage space, but it stillrequires three times as much room as PLV and it introduces annoyingaudio-to-video sync problems.andP;  A talking head onscreen can look like a badlydubbed foreign film.andP;  Even taking advantage of the old space-saving RTV rate,our 55 minutes of Lipchitz video entirely consumed and then overran a 600MBhard disk.andP;  The prototyping of a full, hour-long application in RTV isvirtually impossible.andM;Intel suggests using RTV to prototype only a portion of an application andthen going to PLV for the completed work.andP;  But that would introduce yetanother problem: RTV does not have the precision to record a sharply definedvideo segment.andP;  inevitably, the recording process yields an RTV segment witha little surplus video at either end.andP;  (To record RTV, you must estimate andthen create a capture buffer slightly larger than your video requires, thenstart RTV recording with a DOS command.andP;  Then, manually start video into thesystem at a signal.andP;  Intel has commissioned a video editor that can clip theexcess video from either end of a segment.andP;  Until it is available, the onlyediting option is to play a segment from within an RTV clip.andP;  Fortunately,Authology lets you designate where to start and how many video frames toplay.andP;  Determining those frame numbers, however, is a very tedious process.andM;Digital domain Whether you take your video as far as PLV or stop at RTVdepends on more than just money.andP;  The prohibitive cost of producing originalvideo means that much of what will become DVI programming will come fromexisting sources.andP;  The owners of that material may balk when they realizethat their property is about to be digitized.andP;  Digitized data is more easilyreproduced, borrowed and distorted.andM;Programming the application The Histor trio had anticipated the leap fromanalog to digital.andP;  Once our video resided in the development system,creating a program to access it with Authology was easy.andP;  Our C code, nowlinked to the Authology code, interpreted a typed question and yielded avideo segment number.andP;  Authology played the segment and then returned foranother question.andP;  Using Authology's built-in graphics editor, we created atext screen of instructions and an opening screen with  graphic  push-buttonchoices: either view an introductory video clip or begin the interactivequestion-and-answer application.andM;Had we aimed to produce a finished DVI compact disc, rather than merelyinvestigate the DVI development process, we might have traveled a differentpath--first prototyping only enough of the application to see it work andthen forking out the dough to have Intel's Compression Services make ourentire 55 minutes of video PLV.andP;  With that, we could have replaced our RTVprototype segments and finished the application.andM;If we had taken the final step of mastering and pressing a CD-ROM, we wouldhave found it the easiest and least expensive phase of the process.andP;  In fact,we were surprised that the expenses we incurred vastly outweighed thedifficulties we met.andP;  Even though the price of the hardware is now a fractionof what it was, the system and authoring software is not.andP;  Factor in a visitto San Jose or Princeton to learn Authology and the cost of PLV compressionuntil Intel advances the RTV state of the art, and your first DVI productionmight run you more than $30,000.andP;  And that's without producing the video,audio and interactive design, which is the costliest aspect of any multimediaproject.andM;The result These investments should be judged in light of what DVI returns,though.andP;  The current craze over multimedia proves that a PC presentationbecomes far more compelling when imbued with video as well as text andgraphics.andP;  We understood that the first time we saw Jacques Lipchitz, a manwho died almost 20 years ago, respond almost magically to our questions.andM;DVI permits a user to view Lipchitz in an onscreen window side by side withhis sculpture or stroll forward and backward in a 360-degree path around aLipchitz piece while listening to the sculptor discuss its features.andM;Looking bock now on a successful DVI development, are the major expenses onDVI justified? The answer is obvious when you've seen the result.andP;  No othertechnology comes as close to the ideal of communicating with computers.andM;Steve Sagman, a freelance writer based in Now York, is the author of UsingHavard Graphics and 1-2-3 Graphic Techniques.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
