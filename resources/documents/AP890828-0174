OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Bell Atlantic reached tentative pacts Monday with striking unionsin Pennsylvania, foreshadowing the end of a 23-day walkout by phoneworkers in six states and Washington, D.C.   Illinois Bell, meanwhile, agreed to a contract with its strikers.But union officials urged Illinois members to stay out untilagreements are reached with Bell companies in Michigan and Indiana.   Another strike continued in New York City, where hundreds ofunion members held a rally at Flushing Meadows Park, site of theU.S. Open Tennis championship. NYNEX Corp., serving New York andmost of New England, is a corporate sponsor of the tournament, whichbegan Monday.   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlierthis month against four of the so-called ``Baby Bell'' regionaltelephone companies formed after the 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T.   Bell Atlantic's strike began Aug. 6. A tentative contractsettlement was reached 11 days later with the company, which coversWest Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania,Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.   However, local issues remained in dispute, and CWA officials hadurged the 41,000 strikers to remain out until they were resolved inall seven states.   Agreements were reached Monday with the last unions: two CWAlocals representing 8,900 technicians and 2,700 servicerepresentatives in Pennsylvania and two Delaware locals, saidspokesmen for Bell Atlantic subsidiaries Bell of Pennsylvania andDiamond State Telephone.   In a statement from Washington, CWA Vice President Peter Catuccitold strikers to report to work at the start of their next shift.   However, Denny Martin, president of a Pennsylvania local, saidlater that a hitch had developed over one or two issues in theDelaware pact, and said no one would report to work until it wasresolved. A resolution was expected shortly.   Negotiations were continuing, according to Bell of Pennsylvaniaspokesman Mike Kaine.   Neither side released terms of the agreements. The issuesdiscussed included grievance procedures, work rules, and contractingfor outside work, officials said.   ``We are pleased to have reached an end to this long dispute withthe Bell Atlantic companies,'' Catucci said earlier.   Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman Tom Duddy said the strikeinconvenienced few customers, but said it would take a few days toreturn to normal operations.   ``Twenty-three days is a long time for a strike,'' he said.``We're proud of the way both sides of the picket line have handledthemselves.''   A tentative contract settlement has also been reached at PacificTelesis, which serves California and Nevada.   Weekend settlements in Ohio and Wisconsin paved the way for theIllinois contract agreement, said CWA spokesman Steve Rosenthal.Bell companies in those three states, as well as Indiana andMichigan, are subsidiaries of Ameritech.   Although union officials urged strikers to stay out pendingsettlements in Michigan and Indiana, Illinois Bell expressed hopethat workers would be back on the job soon. The company saidmanagers would continue filling in.   Details of the three-year pact were withheld until they could begiven to the 2,900 strikers, most of them operators, who walked outAug. 13. No date for a ratification vote was announced.   Both sides described the agreement as fair. `It containsprovisions that will increase basic wages, improve pension andhealth care benefits and address child and family care needs,'' thecompany and union said in a joint statement.   Negotiators on both sides would not say whether a compromise hadbeen reached on the main issue: how a 5 percent pay raises would begranted.   The union had objected to a company proposal to give part of theraise as a one-time $1,000 payment to each employee in the firstyear of the pact. The union wanted the full 5 percent, which wouldgive workers a higher base from which to calculate raises andovertime pay.   Under the current contract, CWA employees start at $222 a weekand can rise to a maximum of $446 after five years.   At the New York rally, union members heard speeches by CWAPresident Morton Bahr and other union leaders, then marched aroundthe section of the park where the U.S. Open was being played.   The union was not trying to disrupt the games or keep people fromattending, said union spokesman Bob Masters.   Talks involving NYNEX, the CWA and the International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers are to resume Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
