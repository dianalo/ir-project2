That scenario is the ``farthest thing from our mind,'' saidMelvyn Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for internationalnarcotics.   Levitsky also told members of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee he is optimistic U.S. officials can reach an agreementwith Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori about a strategy toreduce the production of coca while encouraging economicdevelopment.   The U.S. plan calls for sending military equipment and``trainers'' to help Peru's law enforcement agencies fight drugs.   Fujimori said during his campaign that he would reject any``foreign intervention'' in the war against drugs.   But Levitsky said there may have been a misunderstanding on thepart of Fujimori about what the United States wants to do.Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Lima have not discussed thesituation with Fujimori, Levitsky said.   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said there was apparently ``confusionabout the new government's'' position on U.S. participation inPeru's war on drugs. ``I am wary about the administration'splans,'' he said.   Fujimori, who must contend with a decade-long war with leftistShining Path guerrillas as well as with cocaine traffickers, saidhe favors economic support to military force in eradicating cocaplantations.   Last week, William J. Bennett, the administration's drug policycoordinator, said he hopes to complete a formal agreement soon withPeru so the United States can start providing military equipmentand training to Peruvian police and military.</TEXT></DOC>
