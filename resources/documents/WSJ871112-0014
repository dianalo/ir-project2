The proposed article would mean that local subsidiaries of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and Atlantic Richfield Co., which run about 60% of Brazil's estimated 19,800 service stations, would, under their present structures, have to go out of business.    The draft committee's proposals will be voted on by a full constitutional convention, perhaps before the end of the year.    The proposal on petroleum products was attacked by officials of both Brazilian and foreign concerns. The local Shell subsidiary said it will do &quot;everything legal and within our power to convince public opinion of the need to reconsider the position taken by the draft committee.&quot;    Even Petrobras, the government oil company, which has a monopoly on prospecting and refining and runs about 20% of Brazil's gas stations, termed the committee's action extreme. The proposed article also would nullify contracts under which Petrobras has allowed foreign companies such as British Petroleum PLC and France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine to drill for oil in restricted areas.    Protectionist sentiment here, particularly concerning information industries, has caused conflicts with the U.S. recently. In the most recent development, Washington is nearing a decision to penalize Brazil for its restraints on imports of U.S. computer software. </TEXT></DOC>
