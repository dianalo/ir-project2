Suchspace is then subject to the provisions of andSection; 231a.5(h)(2) (i) and(ii).(iv) When a credit union that meets the 95 percent criterion uses its ownfunds to expand, modify, or renovate Government-owned space, it may beprovided a no-cost permit or license for a period not to exceed 25 years.Duration of the permit or license shall be commensurate with the extentof the improvements as determined by the DoD Component concerned. It shallbe effective until the agreed date of expiration or until the credit unionceases to satisfy the 95 percent criterion. In this latter case, the no-costpermit shall be cancelled in favor of a lease immediately negotiated atfair market value under the provisions of andSection; 231a.5(h)(2)(i). Ifthe credit union desires, this lease at fair market value may extend throughthe period identified in the original license, or five years, whicheveris greater.(v) Similarly, a credit union not meeting the 95 percent criterion thatuses its own funds to expand, modify or renovate Government-owned space,may be provided a lease at the fair market value for a period not to exceed25 years. Duration of this lease shall be commensurate with the extentof the improvements as determined by the DoD Component concerned.(3) <T3>Utilities, base services, and equipment. </T3>(i) When available, janitorialservices, utilities (such as air-conditioning, heat, and light), fixtures,and maintenance shall be furnished at no cost to a credit union occupyingfree space in a Government building.
