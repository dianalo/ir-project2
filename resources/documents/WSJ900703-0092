But they also wantout earlier.   Half the top managers below chief executive at majorcorporations aspire to be CEOs or own their own firms, upfrom a third who shared the ambition 10 years ago. Yet asurvey by Korn/Ferry International and UCLA's AndersonGraduate School of Management shows that 91% of theexecutives would retire early, up from 82%; only 10% wouldwork as long as possible, down from 17%, and 63% wouldcontinue working if financially independent, off from 68%.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Today's executives are more ambitious and less satisfiedthan their counterparts 10 years ago,&quot; says Lester Korn,chairman of the recruiting company. Only 48% would choose thesame career if they were starting over, down from 60% whowould have walked the same path a decade ago. The executives,moreover, contend they would like to spend more time withtheir children and less time traveling and in school. Yetthey still maintain a grueling pace.   The managers put in an average 56 hours at work each week,up three hours in 10 years.                                                                                                          BUSINESS JITTERS keep many executives close to desks thissummer.   When Stephen Pistner took over as chief executive oftroubled Ames Department Stores, he told senior managers &quot;I'mgoing to ruin your summer but save your future.&quot; So neitherMr. Pistner nor Douglas Ewing, a vice president who recallsthe incident, are planning breaks this year. Nor is FredCarr, First Executive Corp.'s CEO, who has been busilydefending the firm's investment strategy. He isn't &quot;opposed&quot;to vacations, he says. He just doesn't have time.   John Teets, chairman of Greyhound Dial Corp., is gettingaway for 10 days in August to &quot;count waves&quot; in Maui. Still,he'll take along a portable fax to keep in touch. But JackSnyder, a group vice president of Ball Corp., plans aMinnesota canoe trip that will keep him out of contact withhis business world. Similarly, Peter Churm, CEO of Furon Co.,has set a two-week fishing expedition in British Columbia,arguing &quot;no one person is essential to the operation of anycompany, no matter what he says.&quot;                                                                                                          EXECUTIVE COMP: Even those awarding pay aren't surethey're doing right.   Chairmen of compensation committees at major corporations-- outside directors who generally run other companies --overwhelmingly believe that &quot;shareholder interests should belinked to executive compensation.&quot; But a survey by Hay Group,a consulting firm, finds only one-third of the chairmen&quot;strongly agree&quot; their companies are doing a &quot;good job&quot; oflinking the two.   They aren't necessarily compatible, suggests Ira Kay, aHay senior vice president. The compensation chairmen believethat executives view base salary as the most important partof their pay while shareholders may be served best bylong-term incentives that tie pay to stock values. Hay saysbase pay accounts for 38% of a CEO's compensation; long-termincentives bring in 27%. Bonuses are 22% and benefits 13%.   Protecting share owners may require firms to put moreweight on the longterm component, Mr. Kay suggests.                                                                                                          THE BITE IS BIGGER. Nearly half the employers who havefigured up the cost of retiree health coverage find theirliability is larger than anticipated, consultant FosterHiggins says. Only 7% find the bill is less.                                                                                                          ILLITERACY CREEPS IN. People who can't read or handlenumbers are hired for jobs that don't require the basicskills. They become problems when given new duties, say theSociety for Human Resource Management and Commerce ClearingHouse.                                                                                                          COMMITMENT FADES. Only 43% of the workers with less than ayear on the job view their companies as &quot;more than just aplace to work.&quot; And even that rate slips to 32% after fiveyears, Wyatt Co. says.                                                                                                          SOMEBODY'S GOT a big office. The Building Owners andManagers Association International says the average officeworker has 266 square feet of personal space.                                                                                                          GUARDING HENHOUSE means making sure the fox doesn't apply.   At Barton Protective Services Inc. in Louisiana, screeningbegins on the telephone; applicants are put on hold to hearthe company's drug-free policy. Then come a questionnaire,two interviews, credit checks, psychological and drug tests,police screening and 32 hours of training. ExecuTech Inc.,Denver, checks police files and puts applicants through 40hours of school. Armed guards get special training. EpicSecurity in New York says its screening process winnows out24 of 25 applicants.   But industry officials say problems persist, if at otherfirms, not their own. &quot;You've got convicted felons who workas trusted security guards for months before their recordsare discovered,&quot; asserts Ira Lipman, president of GuardsmarkInc., Memphis. Robert Trotta of Tandamp;M Security Service in NewYork says he routinely sends applicant fingerprints to stateofficials but sometimes never gets a response. So he hiresretired and off-duty law-enforcement officers.   San Francisco Security Services complains Californialimits how applicants can be questioned and tested.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: If they don't know? Nearly 60% of Harvardundergraduates believe they don't know themselves well enoughto make career decisions, Rabb Planning Center says. . . .But about housing: Summer interns seeking rentals in New Yorkreject the &quot;status-conscious life style&quot; of the past for&quot;more austere, socially conscious&quot; dwellings, Spencer Realtysays.</TEXT></DOC>
