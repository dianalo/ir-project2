Unemployment and other economic troubles hit rural areas broadlyin the early 1980s, as small-town businesses and industries as wellas farmers felt the crunch. Ken Deavers of the department'sEconomic Research Service says the rural areas still have not fullyrecovered.   ``In terms of rural economic development, you can't use what youdid in the 1970s as a model for what you're going to do in the1980s,'' he said. ``Therefore, I think that the rural economicadjustment to the new set of realities, both domestically andinternationally, is going to be very difficult.''   During the 1970s, the rural South became the nation'smanufacturing center for textiles, apparel, wood products andshoes. In the West, mining, gas and oil production were thriving.   There was an unprecedented boom in farming, and rapid growth inthe service sector. Several million people moved from urban areasto the countryside and small towns.   But as international markets weakened and as Third Worldcountries stepped up the competition for low-wage, low-skill jobs,rural manufacturing suffered. Energy industries slipped intorecession as a world oil glut sent prices downward.   Deavers offered this profile of rural America in the currentissue of Farmline magazine:   _The average unemployment rate is more than 9 percent, wellabove the national average.   _People are moving away. In 1986, more than half of all ruraland small-town counties declined in population.   _The tax base in rural communities is shrinking, which meansthat local services such as schools, fire departments, watersystems and police all suffer.   ``Rural America is not primarily agricultural, and its economicfuture is more tightly linked with national and internationaldevelopments,'' he said. ``In short, small towns across ruralAmerica are fighting problems of unemployment, inadequate servicesand financial stress.''   Many small towns are working hard to develop self-help,revitalization strategies, Deavers said. And they are gettingresults.   An agency documentary aired on many public television stationsacross the country illustrates some of the local efforts. Theone-hour video, ``Your Hometown,'' shows how several ruralcommunities have approached economic development. Deavers also isfeatured in the program.   ``Solving their own problems has got to be the basic strategythat rural communities follow,'' Deavers said. ``Developingopportunities that provide solutions to the problems has to comefrom within, not from outside the community.''

Lyng hasannounced a five-year plan to improve job opportunities for womenand minorities at the Agriculture Department.   Lyng said Tuesday the plan sets goals ``to increase theemployment of minorities and women in occupations and (pay) gradeswhere they are under-represented, compared to the civilian laborforce.''   The plan, which covers the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1through 1992, is another step in an initiative Lyng announced twoyears ago to begin correcting inequities in USDA employmentpractices.   At that time, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionranked USDA 52nd in a field of 58 federal agencies in theemployment of minorities.   Since 1985, total USDA employment has been reduced by nearly6,500 permanent positions, Lyng said. But the percentage ofminorities in the department's current workforce of 90,000permanent employees increased to 14.6 percent from 13 percent.   The number of women at USDA increased to 35 percent from 32.9percent in 1985, he said.   ``It has been a long time coming, but the fact that we haveproduced this department-wide plan for affirmative employment makesit clear that the Department of Agriculture is totally committed toequal opportunity in every facet of its operation,'' Lyng said.   The plan was prepared by the department's Office of Advocacy andEnterprise and the Office of Personnel. It establishes specifichiring and promotion goals for each occupation and minority, basedon an analysis of current USDA employment.   Further, the plan sets management guidelines and objectives forminority recruitment, hiring and promotion, employee developmentprograms, program monitoring and evaluation, preventing sexualharassment and handling discrimination complaints.   According to the plan, USDA women ``exceed the government-wideaverage in administrative occupations, but trail badly inprofessional and technical positions.''   In the technical jobs, women work primarily at ``indooroccupations rather than field-going jobs, perpetuating the ideathat women cannot or will not perform outside, strenuous or dirtywork,'' the report said.   Also, it said, 74 percent of all female employees are currentlyin pay grades GS-8 and below, compared with 26 percent of all maleemployees in those lower grades.</TEXT></DOC>
