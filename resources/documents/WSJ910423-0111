Whatever had beennegotiated by the administration would soon lose its formunder a barrage of congressional amendments, and quicklybecome unacceptable to the trading partner, or partners, withwhich it had been agreed.   So, the mechanism of fast-track authority was devised in1934 to strike a balance between congressional oversight andexecutive power in the making of trade agreements.</LP><TEXT>   Under this agreement, Congress grants the executive branchso-called fast-track negotiating authority for a limitedtime. The administration can then strike agreements underthis authority that are subject only to a straight up or downvote in both houses of Congress within a short period fromtheir completion.   The administration's current four-year fast-tracknegotiating authority runs out in June, and so -- in order tonegotiate the U.S.-Mexico pact and complete a new world tradeaccord -- the administration is requesting a two-yearextension to run until June 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
