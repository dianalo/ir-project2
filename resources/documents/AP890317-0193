Seeds gathered in far-off countriescontain the priceless genetic stuff American breeders need todevelop crops resistant to insects, disease and drought. Yet, asreported in the second story of a three-part series, ``Seeds ofConflict,'' the United States has risked its access to foreign seedsby imposing political embargoes on shipments of seeds to sixcountries.</TEXT><BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE><BYLINE>and</BYLINE><BYLINE>PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite repeated vows not to play politics withthe genetic resources critical to the world's food supply, theUnited States is quietly maintaining seed embargoes against sixcountries it regards as adversaries, government documents show.   The embargoes contradict stated U.S. policy that these resourcesshould be the common property of humanity, to be shared as freely asthe air and the sea. The availability of this ``germplasm'' from allnations is the key to breeding crops able to withstand pests andsuch climatic changes as greenhouse warming.   While America may be the world's breadbasket, it is gene-poor.The traits responsible for Iowa's hearty corn or the miles of wheatin Kansas didn't come from this continent. The only native U.S.crops are the pecan, a few species of berries and an obscure tubercalled the Jerusalem artichoke.   U.S. breeders thus depend on the good graces of gene-rich nationsin Latin America, Asia and Africa to obtain the germplasm necessaryto ensure future bountiful harvests.   Yet a three-month investigation by The Associated Press revealedthe United States has put six countries on a germplasm``blacklist'': North Korea since 1950, Cuba since 1963, Cambodia andVietnam since 1975, Nicaragua since 1985 and Libya since 1986.   The seed embargoes are part of overall trade bans the federalgovernment has imposed over the years against countries it considersadversaries.   Agriculture Department officials fear that including germplasm inthe embargoes could prompt retaliation by developing countries,leaving U.S. agriculture the prime victim.   Those officials have struggled for two years to get germplasmexempted from the embargoes. The State Department has blocked thoseefforts, officials of both departments said.   ``The very great majority of our germplasm resources come herefrom overseas, and if I thought there were any impediment to thatexchange, I would raise holy hell,'' said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.,chairman of the House subcommittee on Operations, Research andForeign Agriculture, who expressed shock upon learning of theembargoes in an interview.   The California Democrat, whose committee oversees the nation'sgermplasm system, called the embargoes ``an example of that age-oldadage: `there ain't no damn reason for it; it's just our policy.'''   Germplasm is ``an inherent part of our biological system. Wedepend on all countries for our germplasm,'' said Henry L. Shands,head of the USDA's germplasm program and a leader of efforts to endthe embargoes.   ``I don't think it bodes well for us as a country to say, `Wesupport a free policy of exchange,' and then have others be able tosay, `Well, you don't send it,''' Shands said.   Even with the embargoes, American gene banks are unrivaled inmaking their resources available to researchers around the world,said George White, head of the USDA office that approves plantimports and exports. Each year, 1,500 to 2,000 shipments are sent toas many as 120 countries, White said.   ``I really think our record is second to none in making materialsavailable freely to anyone around the world,'' he said.   USDA officials note the United States is not alone in restrictinggermplasm exchange for political reasons. Ethiopia, for example,forbids exports of coffee germplasm. Turkey embargoes export oftobacco germplasm. Egypt bans export of cotton germplasm.   Furthermore, germplasm embargoes are so easily circumvented thatthey amount to little more than a symbolic slap at the targetednations.   Scientists need only slip seeds into an envelope and mail them.   ``If the Cubans want something from our banks, they can alwaysask somebody else to get it for them. They can ask the Soviets, orthe French, or an international agency,'' said Shands.   So slipshod are the embargoes that White's plant introductionoffice itself approved delivery of 13 varieties of cotton seed toVietnam in 1977, two years after trade with Vietnam was embargoed,according to a USDA tally of overseas shipments.   The same tally indicates 73 germplasm samples were sent toNicaragua in 1987 with USDA approval.   White acknowledged the Vietnam shipment. He said he could notlocate the file describing the Nicaragua shipments.   ``I imagine that those were sent out by people unaware of theembargoes, or simply forgot about them,'' said White.   The issue could open the United States to charges of hypocrisy ata meeting on germplasm trade of the Food and AgricultureOrganization scheduled for April 17-21 in Rome.   Embargoes ``bother me not because I know of any specific thing welose,'' said Orville G. Bentley, U.S. Assistant Secretary ofAgriculture for science and education. ``It bothers me because ofthe inconsistency. All the people I talk to believe in freeexchange.''   Mounting concern prompted Shands to call several private meetingsover the last two years with officials from the departments ofState, Treasury and Commerce, the three departments besidesAgriculture involved in the import and export of germplasm.   He drafted a proposed ``memorandum of understanding'' which hehoped all four departments could sign to exempt germplasm fromembargoes.   The memo, made available to the AP, set criteria for``authorizing the importation or exportation of germplasm to or froma country as to which a ban on trade exists under U.S. law.''   Shands said he had hoped the memorandum would be signed beforethe April meeting of the FAO.   But a State Department official who participated in the lastmeeting eight months ago said others in the department remain``opposed to making any exception.''   ``That's pretty much a general, across-the-board position theytake,'' he said. ``They say the same thing to the Coca-Cola company.There are people all the time trying to get exceptions for aparticular interest. If you start making exceptions to tradeembargoes, they'll be like Swiss cheese.''   The official, who oversees FAO affairs for the State Department,spoke only on condition of anonymity.   USDA officials said the United States had never rejected a directrequest for germplasm by embargoed countries because no country hadasked.   Yet USDA correspondence shows the United States did reject arequest in 1986.   Nicaraguan researchers wrote the Rodale Research Center inKutztown, Pa., for samples of amaranth, a high protein crop alsoknown as pokeweed.   Leon Weber, a researcher at Rodale, sent the seeds to White'soffice at the USDA. After some delay, Weber was told that ``therewas no channel to forward the germplasm to Nicaragua because of theembargo.''   A handwritten annotation in White's file reads, ``seedsdestroyed.''   ``That's the tragedy of these kinds of regulations,'' Weber said.``For political reasons, we're hampering researchers from freelyexchanging germplasm.''</TEXT><NOTE>Next: `Seed Wars' Center on Patents and Profits</NOTE><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, March 28</NOTE></DOC>
