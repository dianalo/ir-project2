For example,automotive system restoration is recently an essential component of powersystem control software. System restoration in general starts with faultdiagnosis. At present, fault diagnosis is performed by human operators.They determine a faulted component based on the behavior of relayingsystem and circuit breakers. As the power and its relaying system becomescomplex, fault diagnosis is getting more and more difficult. Some automatedmethod to solve the fault diagnosis problem must be developed. One approachis to write a computer program that emulates human operators diagnosinga power system fault. Computer system of this kind is called the expertsystem in the artificial intelligence field. The aim of our researchis to develop an expert system for fault diagnosis which can be usedin online control systems. Some studies have already been reported onexpert systems for diagnosis use (Talukdar et al (2) and Gonzalex etal (3)). Our view on this approach is that there are some limitationscommon to the expert systems of the present generation. The largest amongthem is the difficulty of making a knowledge base perfect. In other words,a knowledge base is likely to be incomplete because of their incrementaldevelopment. This paper proposes a method which can make up for incompletenessof the knowledge base without losing the capability of fault diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
