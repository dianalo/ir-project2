<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0549 </DOCNO><TEXT>The composite slurry from four 3.5-m/sup 3/ ferrocement digesters feda mixture of nightsoil water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and ricestraw was loaded into four 200-m/sup 2/ earth fish ponds at organic loadingrates of 25, 50, and 100 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) ha/sup -1/ day/sup-1/. Impressive extrapolated net fish yields of about 10 kg ha/sup -1/day/sup -1/ (3.7 ton ha/sup -1/ year/sup -1/) were obtained at the highestorganic loading rate, equivalent to loading rates of about 120 kg totalsolids and 4.5 kg total Kjeldahl nitrogen ha/sup -1/ day/sup -1/. Theremay be potential for even greater yields from biogas slurry fed fishponds because the relationship between net fish yields and slurry loadingrate was linear. Constraints in the development of integrated biogastechnology for poor farmers in the tropics are likely to be associatedwith the digester rather than with the reuse of slurry for fish culture.</TEXT></DOC>
