Fly-ash resistivity is an important consideration in the operationof particulate-control devices based on electrostatic principles (thehigher the resistivity of the fly-ash, the more difficult it is to collect).Because of the need for characterization of fly ash resistivity and thelarge amount of time required to conduct the manual test, it was decidedto automate the test. A standard (STD) bus computer was used in the automatedtest to monitor the temperature, collect current readings, and transferthe data to a personal computer. The personal computer was programmedto calculate and plot the results from the data received from the STDcomputer. The automated system tracks the manual system closely. It alsoconsistently produces smoother curves and is very precise for duplicateruns. Most importantly, operator time for the test was reduced from about6.5 hours per test to about 1 hour, thereby improving productivity.</TEXT></DOC>
