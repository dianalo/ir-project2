These analysts believe the central bank, with an eye on theNovember presidential election, has done all the credit tighteningit intends for a while.   For this reason, they are looking for interest rates to stayabout where they are currently in coming months. That would be goodnews for the housing industry as mortgage rates level off, and itwould mean consumers and businesses may be spared another jump inthe prime lending rate.   Greenspan, delivering his mid-year report on Fed monetary policyto Congress on Wednesday, issued some stern warnings about risinginflationary threats in the economy, singling out tight labormarkets, rising import prices and the drought's effect on grainprices as particularly worrisome.   He said the central bank had already made a series of credittightening moves ``from late March through late June'' in an effortto keep inflation in check.   ``The costs to our economy and society of allowing a moreintense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious,''Greenspan said.   But Greenspan also suggested that the credit-tightening whichhas occurred may be enough to dampen inflationary pressures becauseof an expected moderation in growth in the second half of 1988.   Greenspan said that factory utilization rates ``could well topout soon'' and he also predicted that the unemployment rate, whichhas fallen dramatically this year, would level off. Both of thosedevelopments would be seen as easing inflationary pressures.   In response to a question, Greenspan said he did not think thatfurther increases in interest rates were inevitable, especially ifcurrent inflationary pressures begin to ease.   There had been widespead expectations that the Fed would soonmove to nudge interest rates higher, especially since theunemployment rate fell to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June.   But many analysts said Greenspan's comments seemed to indicatethat the central bank is satisfied that it has done enough for now.   Beginning in late March, the Fed initiated a series ofcredit-tightening moves by reducing the amount of money banks haveto make loans. Those efforts have pushed a key interest rate, therate banks charge each other for overnight loans, up by a fullpercentage point.   That in turn triggered an increase in the prime lending rate to9 percent in May and sent mortgage rates, which had dropped below10 percent, up to a current level of 10.38 percent.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a NewYork securities dealer, said he believed rates would hold steady atthese levels in coming months.   ``Greenspan feels he has taken the appropriate tightening stepsand that will be enough to cool off demand growth in the secondhalf of the year,'' Jones said.   ``Greenspan believes the economy will not be that strong in thesecond half and that you shouldn't tighten credit conditions withan economy slowing considerably,'' said Michael Evans, head of aWashington consulting firm.   David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc.,predicted that the Federal Reserve would ``keep its head low duringthe election campaign'' and will avoid its strongest tighteningmove, a boost in the discount rate it charges on money it loans tomember banks.   Many analysts believe that Greenspan, and the other members ofthe Federal Reserve's board of governors, all appointed byPresident Reagan, would try to keep the economy on an even keel inan effort to promote George Bush's presidential chances.   But some senators at the hearing expressed concern thatGreenspan and the Fed had already overdone the efforts attightening credit conditions and had raised the risk of a recessionnext year.   ``I would come down on the side of avoiding a recession almostat all costs,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., lectured Greenspan. ``Ido hope the Fed would not be hypersensitive to signs, real orimagined, of inflation.''</TEXT></DOC>
