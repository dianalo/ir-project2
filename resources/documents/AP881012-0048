The final numerical sequence required for the solution flashedinto a laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday,marking a development that will probably force cryptographers torethink how some codes used by governments and banks are applied inthe future, said The New York Times.   The 100-digit number was chosen by an elaborate mathematicalscreening process to afford the maximum possible difficulty, theTimes said. The two factors found are 41 digits and 60 digits,respectively.   A number's factors are smaller numbers that when multiplied byeach other produce the larger number. A prime number is one that isevenly divisible only by one or by itself.   The project was organized by Mark S. Manasse, of the DigitalEquipment Corp.'s Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, and ArjenK. Lenstra of the University of Chicago. They were helped by 12users of about 400 computers in the United States, the Netherlandsand Australia who donated computer time when not needed for theirregular work.   Factoring the 100-digit number took less than a month. Intheory, one expert said, a supercomputer like the Cray, operatingcontinuously, could have solved the problem in about a week. Butsupercomputers cost thousands of dollars an hour to run, andoperating the range of simpler computers for short periods whenthey were idle kept the cost down to virtually nothing, the Timessaid.   There has been rapid progress in the factoring field this year,with the same group establishing a record with a 96-digit numberjust three weeks ago. According to Lenstra, the record has beenbroken about once a year this decade. Manasse predicted a 106-digitnumber will have been factored by the end of the winter.   Here is the problem they solved:</TEXT><TEXT>   The number to be factored:9,412,343,607,359,262,946,971,172,136,294,514,357,528,981,378,983,082,541,347,532,211,942,640,121,301,590,698,634,089,611, 468,911,681.
