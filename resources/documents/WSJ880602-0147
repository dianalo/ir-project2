The action comes amid speculation that banks and insurers will be required to disclose identities and transactions of officials who have substantial company stock holdings.    The spokesman said no decisions have been reached on potential rule changes that must be forwarded to the Finance Ministry for further action. The spokesman and an official of the ministry's Securities Bureau denied unconfirmed reports that banks as well as life and non-life insurance companies will be required to notify regulatory authorities of the identities and transactions of executives who hold more than 10% of the shares of a given company.    Extending reporting requirements would represent an enlargement of a rule, effective last September, which imposed a detailed registration system for company officials who own large blocks of corporate stock.    If an official sells shares within six months of purchase, the transaction could be subject to regulatory scrutiny. The registration system applies to insider employees at securities houses, and could be applied to insurance and banking officials to discourage abuses of information gathered through in-house business dealings with clients or other &quot;insider&quot; sources. </TEXT></DOC>
