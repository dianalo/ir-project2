(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six teen-agers en route to a party werekilled when their compact car swerved in front of a pickup truck andwas crushed, police said.   ``This is the worst wreck I've ever seen,'' John Meiners, asafety officer with an area volunteer fire department, said afterthe Friday night accident. ``I haven't seen anything like this sinceI was an 18-year-old Marine in Vietnam putting bodies inhelicopters.''   Sheriff John Raichl said there was no evidence that any of theteen-agers had been drinking before the accident on U.S. 101 alongthe northern Oregon coast.   ``It's unbelievable in a town this size to have six kids go justlike that,'' said Art Stromsness of Hughes-Ransom Mortuary. The townhas 2,500 residents.   The victims were identified as Debra Raappana, 19, of Clatskanie,the driver and owner of the car; Tim Morgan, 17, of Astoria; JasonHurly, 16, of Hammond; and Kenneth Goin, 16, Darren Godwin, 15, andSteven Cory Bingaman-Story, 15, all of Warrenton.   Morgan's brother, Keith, 16, was among the first to arrive at theaccident scene. The victims had forced him to ride with some otherteens in another vehicle because the compact car was too crowded.   ``I couldn't see anyone in there,'' he said. ``I called mybrother's name, but he didn't answer.''   Raappana attended Clatsop Community College in Astoria and theother five were enrolled at Warrenton High School, which has 250students.   Jim Hendrickson, 17, of Warrenton, a junior, knew five of thevictims. ``They were pretty nice folks,'' he said. ``They werewell-accepted in school.''   The pickup driver, Robert John Larson, a 28-year-old U.S. CoastGuard member from Warrenton, was treated at a hospital for cuts andbruises and released.   Deputy Sheriff Mark Whisler said Larson reported he barely hadtime to hit the brakes before the teen-agers' car crossed his path.Raichl said it did not appear the pickup had been speeding.</TEXT></DOC>
