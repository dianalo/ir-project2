BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LT GW MCA NWSBANKRUPTCIES (BCY)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   In the latest setback for the troubled independent television-station industry, one concern has filed for bankruptcy-law protection and another may be forced into liquidation proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.    One of the stations, WTTV in Indianapolis, was bought in 1984 for $73 million by a group that includes Michael Milken, the head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bond operation, and other Drexel executives. The station sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors.    Meanwhile, three major syndicators of television reruns filed a Chapter 7 involuntary liquidation petition in Los Angeles against WQTV Inc., the former owner of WQTV in Boston.    The filings come less than a month after Grant Broadcasting System Inc., a major independent station operator, filed under Chapter 11, citing problems meeting financial goals. Miami-based Grant Broadcasting, which owns stations in Chicago, Philadelphia and Miami, was financed in part by about $85 million of junk bonds raised by Drexel.    Some independent stations, particularly newer stations in larger markets, have been squeezed by high programming costs in a weak market for national television advertising. Grant Broadcasting, for one, owes sellers of syndicated reruns about $200 million, industry sources said.    At WTTV in Indianapolis, officials insisted the filing was related to debt, not programming costs. Elmer C. Snow, the station's president, said in a statement that a &quot;problem&quot; with station lenders forced the station into bankruptcy-law protection &quot;as a precautionary measure.&quot; He declined to comment further.    Sources close to the filing said the station has about $85 million in debt -- about half from banks and half in Drexel junk bonds. They said the station has been in technical default of some of its loan covenants recently.    According to Television andamp; Cable Factbook, about 22% of a holding company that owns the station is controlled by Dunmore Partners Ltd., which is 40% owned by Mr. Milken. Other investors in the station include top management.    Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. agreed last year to acquire the station, mainly by assuming its debt. But the purchase was contingent on Lorimar's $1.4 billion acquisition of six television stations controlled by Kohlberg Kravis andamp; Roberts Co. The Kohlberg purchase, which collapsed, would have been financed in part by Drexel.    A Lorimar spokeswoman said the company is still negotiating to buy the station, but added that the bankruptcy-law filing makes the outcome of the talks uncertain. Drexel officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Meanwhile, MCA Inc., parent of Universal Studios; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., a News Corp. Ltd. unit; and Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures unit are seeking about $6 million in syndicated programming payments from WQTV, a WQTV spokesman said.    Los Angeles-based WQTV sold its Boston station assets last year to the Christian Science Monitor for $7.5 million, in part because of financial problems relating to high programming costs, a WQTV spokesman said. The Christian Science Monitor didn't assume the station's liabilities in the sale, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
