This would drastically alter a positionwhich has evolved historically. The draft version of the electricitylaw plans a package of legal authorizations for the Minister for Economicsand adjustments to the organizational structure of the economy in orderto be able to realize the main objectives of the electricity policy.Its main aim is a reliable electricity supply, as economic as possible,which can also stand up to international comparison and is socially responsible.In spite of many complaints the government has carried out no meaningfulchanges to the draft law: There have been changes merely to elucidatecertain problems. Government and the electricity industry have recentlyreached agreement on the introduction of the draft electricity law 1987.The main obstacle to an acceptance of this draft has thus been removed.It can therefore be expected that the electricity law 1987 will comeinto effect on 1. January 1989. (orig./HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
