Workers lacquered the dining room black and rolled a red carpet down the broad staircase. Now it's opening day, and Poles crowd in to sit under tasseled lanterns and fork down jellied-eel salad, horse meat with moon mushrooms and three-taste turkey, all accompanied by steamed rice and rye bread.    Kleig lights flood the scene, and a camera crew records it.    &quot;The place had to be renewed,&quot; says Bogunika Kurdus, the manager. She stands in front of the fish tank in a white coat. &quot;It opened in 1957, but after that we had problems. Now, with China, things are better. You can see our relations in the menu. We've got noodles, moon mushrooms, sesame oil. We would like to have everything we had 30 years ago. Plus chili paste.&quot;    In a town where people still think of soy sauce as exotic, the idea of chili paste seems fantastic. Yet Polish-Chinese relations have taken such a turn of late that diplomats here talk of a Polish restaurant opening in Peking.    The prospect of the Chinese dining out on kilbasa grew bright in September, when Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, set out on a trip to North Korea and Mongolia, and showed up in the communist world's foremost forbidden city. &quot;All roads lead to Peking,&quot; he said as he shook hands with China's chief, Deng Xiaoping, in the Great Hall of the People. &quot;So here I am.&quot;    It was the first courtesy call on China in more than two decades by a viceroy of the Soviet sphere. Erich Honecker, the top East German, quickly followed the general, and Janos Kadar of Hungary will likely pay tribute next. The Czechs and Bulgarians could go, too.    &quot;We are genuinely satisfied to watch the process of China's relations with other socialist countries improving and expanding,&quot; Gen. Jaruzelski said after a dinner in Peking at which Chinese Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang taught him how to handle chopsticks.    Then the general took off for home -- and touched down briefly in Moscow to regale Mikhail Gorbachev with tales of the orient.    Unlike some of his earlier Soviet sojourns, this one was made public. Nobody pretended that a meeting of East and East could have taken place without a permit issued in the U.S.S.R. Nor could a Soviet-dubbed leader let China disrupt his country's &quot;brotherly alliance with our great neighbor,&quot; as Gen. Jaruzelski puts it.    With the Soviets themselves trying to get a foot in China's door, the Eastern Europeans look like Gorbachev advance men. But there is a bit more to it. Though the Chinese have warmed to the Russians, they still have complaints. They don't like Russia's troops on their border, or its troops in Afghanistan, or the troops of Moscow's Vietnamese clients occupying Cambodia. By contrast, the Chinese don't have a whole lot against Russia's brotherly allies in Europe.    &quot;They have obstacles with Moscow,&quot; a Polish official says. &quot;Not with us.&quot;    By doing a little advance work, the Eastern Europeans have gained a rare chance to practice some homemade diplomacy. Especially for Poland, this has real value. Not since the martial law hammer came down in 1981 has a country outside the Warsaw Pact paid it so much respect. Not until now has Poland had a non-allied trading partner that didn't demand to be paid in hard-to-find hard currency.    China, meantime, has a chance to do some playful poaching in the Soviet back-40. What's more, barter trade with Eastern Europe saves money and gives China's economy a non-Western leg to stand on. &quot;Our technology has advantages over Western technology,&quot; says a Polish journalist who follows China. &quot;It's not so advanced. It doesn't save too much labor.&quot;    Easing back into touch with China, it appears, will be next to painless for Eastern Europe. These countries never did participate fully in the Sino-Soviet slanging match. China and Poland even ran a joint shipping line all through the Chinese Cultural Revolution -- and the cultural revolution, Polish-style, of the early 1980s.    China began its Polish rapprochement soon after Gen. Jaruzelski declared martial law: it quit publishing the pronouncements of the outlawed union, Solidarity. During Erich Honecker's visit, with a flourish of diplomatic obfuscation, it amended its policy favoring German reunification; now it favors unity only as long as that doesn't disturb the distinct identity of the East Germans.    As fellow reformers, the Chinese have lots of free-market tips to exchange with the Hungarians. They have gone so far as to show interest in Poland's reforms, if only to learn what not to do. A Polish report on Gen. Jaruzelski's talk with Deng Xiaoping said the Chinese reformer stressed the need to avoid &quot;major mistakes.&quot;    Chinese-Polish trade has already leaped, to $1 billion in 1986 from $281 million in 1984. Chinese saucepans and long underwear cram Polish stores. The Poles are set to sell China a coal-washing plant and two power boilers, and to repair a couple of broken down factories they built there in the 1950s. A Polish official talks of passing China some fancy technology bought in the profligate 1970s from the West.    So many delegations have been whizzing between Warsaw and Peking since the general's trip that the Poles can't find enough translators. A Chinese feature film has just had its Polish premiere. A ping-pong team is due. New members sign up at the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association at the rate of 10 a week.    &quot;I just saw a TV program,&quot; says a young man filling in his application there one day. &quot;It's a wonderful country.&quot;    For this Pole and many others, China has begun its journey back from obscurity, much as it did for the West Europeans and Americans more than a decade ago. Before long, Restauracja Szanghaj may well collect its shipment of chili paste. All it will need after that is a Chinese cook. </TEXT></DOC>
