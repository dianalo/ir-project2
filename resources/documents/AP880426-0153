Justice Department attorney Michael McCord said theEnvironmental Protection Agency thus has no duty to order a groupof Midwestern states, at the behest of a coalition of Northeasternstates, to force pollution reductions on coal-burning utilities andother sources.   In the section of the Clean Air Act relied on by theNortheastern states in a petition to the EPA, ``there is noreference ... to a state (pollution control) implementation plan.Congress' intent ... was to focus on a source or group of sources''that might cause air pollution across a state line, not an entirestate or group of states, McCord told a three-judge panel of theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   He said there was nothing in the history of the legislationgiving EPA the duty to act against entire states when other statescomplain.   The panel was hearing arguments for the second time in a lawsuitbrought against EPA by Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut,Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.   The first argument in December 1985 had to be disregardedbecause two of the three judges that heard it left the court _Antonin Scalia to join the Supreme Court and Robert H. Bork byresignation after the Senate rejected his nomination to the SupremeCourt.   Tuesday's court hearing fell in the middle of three days ofrallies and news conferences arranged by environmental groupsseeking action against acid rain timed to coincide with the visitWednesday of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who also hasbeen pressing the administration to reduce the northbound flow ofair pollution from the United States that causes acid rain.   As part of those events, the International Maple Syrup Institutesaid at a news conference U.S. syrup production had fallen 45percent since 1981 and acid rain was ``the prime suspect.''   A 1985-1986 aerial survey of 27,000 square miles of Quebec maplestands showed 4 percent of the trees had lost more than 25 percentof their leaves and were doomed to die, and 44 percent had lost 11percent to 25 percent of their leaves and were badly damaged, theinstitute said.   Though researchers are still seeking the cause of maple decline,``there is unquestionably a significant correlation between thedeath of maple trees and acid rain,'' Institute President DavidScanlan said.   The institute and the American Forestry Association both calledfor enactment of pending revisions to the Clean Air Act that wouldinstitute an acid rain control program and other measures. But R.Neil Sampson, executive vice president of the forestry association,said, ``For me to say how much acid rain is affecting (syrup)production is something I can't do.''   The Northeastern states are appealing EPA's rejection of theirpetition requesting the agency to order revisions in the airpollution control plans of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois to reduce emissions of sulfurdioxide, a principal precursor of acid rain.   There are no federal laws on acid rain, so the complainingstates had to argue that Pennsylvania, Maine and New York could notmeet various other federal air quality standards because of theMidwestern sulfur dioxide.   The Clean Air Act has a section requiring the EPA administratorto make sure that one state's air pollution control plan does notcause impermissible pollution in another state before he approvesthe plan or revisions to it.   In answering the Northeastern petitions, EPA said it did notknow enough to tell the allegedly offending states how to revisetheir plans.   For the Northeastern states, Greg Sample of the Maine attorneygeneral's office argued that opponents were overestimating theeffects of granting the petition.   ``It is not fair to say that our petition seeks to evaluate allsources or even all major sources'' of sulfur dioxide,'' he said.``We have constantly urged the administrator (of EPA) toconcentrate on the 50 major sources'' in the Midwest.</TEXT></DOC>
