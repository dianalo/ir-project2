A frequency-stabilized laser diode isused to perform crossed-beam laser spectroscopy of the Cs 6S/sub 1/2/(F= 3,4){yields}6P/sub 3/2/(F') transitions. From the measured hyperfinesplittings, we determine the coefficients of the magnetic dipole (A)and electric quadrupole (B) contributions to the hyperfine structure.Our results are A = 50.275(3) MHz and B = -0.53(2) MHz.</TEXT></DOC>
