Kinnock, confident the weeklong conference will endorse a majorpolicy overhaul shifting the socialist movement to the center,added that Britons ``respect us for the changes we have made andare making.''   Kinnock, who received a thunderous reception from the 1,500delegates, has clamped down on Labor's left wing and transformedthe party's poll ratings in the past year.   The party, consistently ahead in the polls since late spring, isnow in its strongest position since its third successive defeat byPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1987. The nextelection must be called by mid-1992.   The new defense policy, stipulating that a Labor-led governmentwould give up British nuclear weapons only as part of a negotiatedarms deal, is part of the new policy. It also ditches some othervote-losers, such as pledges of widespread nationalization.   ``We seek the power ... to stop being spectators and start beingnegotiators,'' said Kinnock during his speech.   He said that because of deep divisions between East and West,``security will continue to mean ... the security of negotiateddisarmament.''   The stance represents a marked personal shift for Kinnock, 47,who had been an ardent beliver in one-sided nuclear disarmamentsince his student days.   He accused Mrs. Thatcher of isolating Britain internationally,citing her combative attitude toward the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, her pressure for NATO to modernize itsshort-range nuclear weapons, and her refusal to impose toughsanctions against South Africa.   ``It's not splendid isolation, or cunning, or sagacity, orstatespersonship,'' said Kinnock. ``It's a fundamental failure toperceive and try to secure Britain's role in a rapidly changingEurope and a rapidly changing world.''</TEXT></DOC>
