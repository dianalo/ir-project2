Mitchell, D-Maine, said Tuesday after he and 11other senators introduced the legislation.   The bipartisan and diverse group said their language remainssubject to hard bargaining, but emphasized they have a consensus onhow to control the estimated 2.7 billion pounds of poisonouschemicals released into the atmosphere each year.   The Environmental Protection Agency, in its first suchcompilation, said April 12 that the toxic air emissions are amongmore than 22 billion pounds of toxic wastes sent into the air,water and land each year.   The legislation to control toxic emissions into the atmosphererepresents a major compromise for lawmakers pushing for new cleanair legislation this year. Senate clean air sponsors said they willintroduce the other components of their legislation in comingmonths: proposals to bring metropolitan areas in compliance withair quality standards, and language to control acid rain.   The air toxics compromise would require companies emitting 10tons or more of any airborne toxic chemical to install the bestavailable control technology.   The Environmental Protection Agency would set emissionsstandards for industries releasing the chemicals. But to encouragepolluters to make immediate and large-scale reductions, they wouldbe granted exemptions if they used technology that achieves a 90percent cutback in emissions by the end of 1992.   If technology did not achieve the required reduction, a companywould have to meet tough emissions limits based on a chemical'srisk of causing cancer or other illnesses.   The legislation would replace a system that has regulated onlyseven toxic chemicals out of nearly 300 emitted into the air.   The EPA is currently required to assess the risk of eachchemical, and then develop chemical-by-chemical emissions standardsdesigned to protect public health, with an ample margin of safety.   The assessment for each chemical takes several years. And whenthe EPA has made proposals, the agency has been sued on grounds itwent too far _ or not far enough.   The bill also would direct EPA to establish a national urban airtoxics program to reduce the release of toxic chemicals from motorvehicles, wood stoves, dry cleaners and gas stations.   In a provision to prevent catastrophic accidents, the bill wouldrequire EPA to list 50 extremely hazardous substances. Facilitieshandling those materials would have to complete reviews to identifypotential accidents. A Chemical Safety Board would be establishedto investigate accidents and make recommendations for preventivemeasures.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the manager of Senate clean airlegislation this year, told reporters, ``There is a public healthcrisis that will worsen if we don't act.''   Ed Barks, spokesman for the National Clean Air Coalition, saidthe environmental groups in the organization believe the bill needsimprovements.   He said that under the bill the EPA could take between five and13 years to set standards for emission reduction for polluters whofail to qualify for the exemption. That timetable is too long, hesaid.   Announcing the compromise were Sens. David Durenberger, R-Minn.;Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; John Breaux, D-La.; Baucus; John Chafee,R-R.I.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.;Mitchell; John Warner, R-Va.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Joseph Lieberman,D-Conn., and James Jeffords, R-Vt.</TEXT></DOC>
