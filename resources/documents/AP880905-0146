The consumer advocates want the Federal CommunicationsCommission to cancel increases scheduled for December and nextApril in the ``line charge'' added to residential phone bills.   Their call is being heard by some members of Congress and thestate utility commissioners, who at the very least want the FCC totake a second vote on the added charges before they take effect.   The increases _ 60 cents per month on Dec. 1 and 30 cents onApril 1, 1989 _ were approved as part of a three-step boost in themonthly line charge that began with a 60-cent increase July 1,1987. The monthly charge is already $2.60.   The FCC approved the increases in April 1987 as a way to furtherreduce long-distance rates and encourage large business users tostay on the public phone network rather than building their ownnetworks.   But the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocatesis asking the FCC to cancel the future increases _ amounting toabout $1 billion a year _ saying they are ``unnecessary,unsupported and unwarranted.''   The association said three telecommunications analystscommissioned by the group to study a June report compiled by theFCC on the effects of the subscriber line charge concluded that thethreat of large users bypassing the local phone network has notmaterialized. Increasing the charge by 90 cents will have no effecton the bypass that is already occurring, they said.   ``We've really attacked the very basis for the subscriber linecharge,'' said Ron Binz, Colorado consumer counsel.   The line charge helps pay the cost of the wire that connects acustomer's telephone with a phone company's central office. Part ofthe cost of that line also is subsidized with long-distance rates,so raising the proportion paid by subscribers reduces long-distancerates. Long-distance rates have dropped more than 30 percent sincethe charge was imposed in 1985.   Raising the line charge also reduces local connection fees paidby large business users. Some businesses find it economical tobuild their own telecommunications networks and bypass the publicphone network.   The FCC continues to support the subscriber line charge and theunderlying policy of shifting the costs of the local phone networkto subscribers, said FCC spokesman John Kamp.   ``The policy ... has worked very well. Bypass has not grown andit has caused rates overall to come down considerably, and we havenot seen evidence to cause us to change course,'' he said.   The agency, however, will ``look very carefully'' at theconsumer advocates' requests to cancel the scheduled increases, hesaid.   But the consumer advocates' group has already taken its case toCongress, where it is talking to Democratic members of thecommunications committees, most of whom opposed the originalimposition of the line charge at $1 in June 1985 and the laterincreases.   The issue ``has caught Congress' eye,'' said Gerard Salemme, anaide to Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Housetelecommunications subcommittee, particularly because of concernsabout an FCC proposal to give ATandamp;T and the local Bell phonecompanies more financial flexibility by capping rates but liftingthe lid on profits.   Salemme said that if price caps were adopted, regulators wouldhave little or no assurance that the line-charge increases werebeing passed along in the form of reduced long-distance rates.   The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners isurging Congress to pressure the FCC into taking a second vote onthe further increases after reviewing the effects of the currentcharges.   ``There is still a lot of healthy skepticism'' among stateregulatory commissioners about the need for further increases inthe line charge, said Sharon Nelson, chairwoman of theassociation's communications committee and head of the Washingtonstate utilities commission.   ``They've been very dubious about this from the verybeginning,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
