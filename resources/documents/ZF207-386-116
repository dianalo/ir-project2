 &quot;It's ironic, considering that when the Mac was introduced in1984 there were more database packages -- 14 -- than there were any othertype of program.&quot;andM;The retail market for Macintosh databases is a tiny fraction compared withthe DOS market, according to a recent report from the Software PublishersAssociation.andP;  In 1988 more than $322 million in DOS database software wassold, compared with only slightly more than $15 million in Macintosh databaseproducts.andM;Macintosh relational databases haven't gained widespread corporate acceptancefor several reasons, according to software consultant Brian Mutert of SanFrancisco-based Stratagem.andM;&quot;The first Mac relational data bases were extremely slow and didn't take fulladvantage of the Mac interface.andP;  And application development methodologiesand procedural languages for Macintosh relational databases weren't up tosnuff compared with a lot of DOS products,&quot; Mutert said.andP;  &quot;Furthermore, therewas no recognized player in the Macintosh market with a reasonable product.&quot;andM;Few companies have been sufficiently satisfied with current offerings --including 4th Dimension, Fox Software's FoxBASE+/Mac, Blyth Software's Omnis,Odesta's Double Helix II, and Ashton-Tate's dBASE for the Mac -- to give themthe corporate seal of approval, according to software analysts.andM;But new 2.0 versions of Fox BASE and 4D could change the picture, Mutertsaid.andP;  &quot;This year, the Macintosh relational database market will be atwo-horse race between Fox and ACIUS,&quot; he said, although other observersthink that Blyth's new Omnis 5 could give the British developer a chance toregain its once-leading position in the Mac business market.andM;It will, however, take some convincing to lure back corporate users who havebeen disappointed with the relational databases released for the Mac thusfar.andM;&quot;Most of them suffer from poor performance and lack of adequatecross-platform compatibility, or they don't have the look and feel of a trueMac application,&quot; said Randy Wiseman, head of hardware and softwareevaluation for a major West Coast petrochemical  company.andM;&quot;Although 4D is commonly used, we don't have an approved high-end Macdatabase yet.andP;  Our end users are telling us to support one product or anothernow,&quot; Wiseman said.andM;To some companies, ease of use and support of a powerful procedural languageare as important as performance in selecting a corporate-standard database.andM;&quot;Speed in searching a database, in compiling data and in creating reports areimportant considerations,&quot; said Robb Kinnen, a microcomputer supervisor withArthur Young andamp; Co.'s metropolitan office in New York.andP;  &quot;But they're not theonly deciding factors.andP;  We're also interested in how quickly a customapplication can be written and how easily the program can be used.&quot;andM;&quot;Before a program is made a standard, we let end users play with it to seewhat they like and what they don't like,&quot; Kinnen said.andM;Selecting a corporate-standard Macintosh database has always been tricky,said Lee Zulman, a contract systems support consultant at NASA's AmesResearch Center in Mountain View, Calif.andM;&quot;Features that have not been popular or required in the past -- completeprogrammability and mainframe connectivity, for example -- are now becomingcorporate requirements,&quot; Zulman said.andM;In response to user requirements for access to mainframe databases, Oraclefor the Macintosh is now supported as a corporate-standard database, Zulmansaid.andP;  &quot;We think Apple's CL/1 technology could also be important in selectingfuture standard Macintosh databases.&quot;andM;Support of SQL within a database may be more important to vendors than users,some Macintosh volume buyers said.andP;  &quot;SQL isn't a big issue with our users,&quot;said Arthur Young's Kinnen.andM;Adam Green, a database consultant from Lexington, Mass., agreed that SQLsupport is not yet a critical issue for most sites.andP;  The real problem Macdatabase vendors have to solve, he said, continues to be performance.andM;&quot;There are more pretty databases on the Mac than there are on any othermachine,&quot; Green said.andP;  &quot;But looks don't matter when it comes to databases.andO;Corporate users care about throughput, and one reason Mac databases haven'ttaken off is that their performance isn't up to par with DOS programs,&quot;
