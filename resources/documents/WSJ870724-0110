GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   For years, U.S. policy toward Panama was paralyzed by the strategic importance of the Panama Canal, the presence there of the headquarters of the U.S. military's Southern Command, and the possibility that too much pressure might produce a leftist coup.    But in recent weeks, the administration, rankled by what it calls the Panamanian government's &quot;unmistakable involvement&quot; in an attack on U.S. diplomatic property, has turned up the pressure.    The administration has suspended economic and military aid until Panama pays for the damage to American property. The U.S. Embassy has closed its consular section; the U.S. Army's logistics maintenance division has cut off routine repairs to Panamanian military forces, and when Panama recently asked for supplies of tear gas to help disperse crowds, the administration refused.    The administration leaves little doubt about where it thinks Panama should be headed. &quot;We've stated clearly that the current role of the {Panamanian} military is anachronistic and has to change,&quot; says Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs.    Panama's corrupt military dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, appears to be nearing the end of his days in power. The Reagan administration, once again, must seek the delicate balance between interfering in another nation's affairs and helping to prod it toward democracy.    In June, Col. Diaz Herrera, who had been second in command of Panama's powerful National Guard, charged that Gen. Noriega was deeply involved in systematic election fraud and the murder of a prominent political opponent. While the substance of the charges wasn't new, the source shocked and galvanized thousands of middle-class Panamanians. Their ranks have grown into a broad-based coalition of lawyers, doctors, teachers and business leaders in a sustained protest that has little precedent in Panama and is inflicting significant damage on the economy.    &quot;Something fundamental has changed, and things won't go back to where they were six weeks ago, when people assumed Noriega could stay as long as he wants,&quot; says a senior U.S. official who has monitored recent events in Panama.    But there are limits to how much the U.S. can do. &quot;We have to be careful to do nothing that would give credence to Gen. Noriega's charges that this is all a gringo plot to kill the Panama Canal treaty,&quot; says Richard Millett, a political science professor at Southern Illinois University. The treaty calls for the U.S. to cede the canal to Panama in the year 2000. Mr. Millett says the U.S. must continue to show its displeasure with the regime without blatantly taking sides with opposition figures.    Helping to depose dictators is a tricky business. The U.S. has succeeded in helping remove civilian dictators, such as Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier and the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos, by convincing the military that its institutional integrity could be preserved only by helping to remove the unpopular ruler. But military dictators such as Gen. Noriega or Chile's Augusto Pinochet often rally the military around them with allegations of foreign-made plots.    Panamanians have a more difficult task: They don't just have to get rid of Gen. Noriega, but of Noriegaism. According to Norman Bailey, former chief economist of President Reagan's National Security Council who now is an international consultant, the U.S. has substantial evidence that the Panamanian National Guard is riddled with corruption. &quot;The Panama government is a government of drug traffickers, gun runners and money launderers,&quot; he asserts.    But economic forces are conspiring against Gen. Noriega. Banking is Panama's largest service industry, and money retreats quickly from unstable political climates. U.S. and Panamanian sources estimate there has been a substantial capital outflow in the past month.    And because the money is in dollars -- Panama doesn't have its own currency, except for coins -- there is little the government can do to stanch the flow.    As pressure continues to mount in Panama, says Mr. Bailey, &quot;the most important thing the U.S. can do is maintain diplomatic relations with the Panamanian government, but, at the same time, consistently reiterate that we favor democratization and civilianization of Panama. We seem to be doing that, finally.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
