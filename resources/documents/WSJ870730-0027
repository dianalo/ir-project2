Garcia</HL><DD> 07/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices climbed to record levels yesterday as investors paid more attention to corporate announcements, second-quarter earnings and special situations.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19.77 points to 2539.54, its second consecutive record finish.    Two broader market averages, which lagged the industrials in the past week, surpassed their previous highs, set July 17. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.77 to 177.01, and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index sprinted ahead 3.32 to 315.65.    Suddenly not too concerned about the prospects for higher interest rates or inflation, institutional investors stepped up their demand for stocks, traders said. About 196.2 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared with 172.6 million Tuesday. Investor focus broadened a bit beyond blue-chips as 1,058 issues advanced and 524 issues declined.    &quot;When portfolio managers are sitting there with cash and the market is going to new highs, it brings them into the market,&quot; said Larry Greenwald, co-head of equity trading at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.    Another trader said that stock investors seem to have forgotten about what is happening with the dollar, bonds or commodities and have focused inwardly on the market and the listed companies. They're paying attention, he said, to such announcements as stock buy-backs, earnings reports and forecasts, and special situations such as restructurings and mergers.    He said he doesn't know how long such factors can keep fueling the market's climb, but &quot;there's a lot of good news in the market.&quot;    Eugene Peroni, director of technical analysis at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said that despite lofty stock prices, investors' confidence is reinforced when they see such companies as American Express, Coca-Cola Co. and Merck willing to spend millions of dollars buying back their shares.    The current advance is pleasant, Mr. Peroni said, but he still sees a chance of a quick and sharp correction. He is concerned about the action in gold stocks in recent weeks.    Four issues that he recommended June 30 -- ASA, Newmont Mining, Echo Bay Mines and Homestake Mining -- have moved up sharply since then. While stock market investors seem relatively unconcerned about inflation right now, Mr. Peroni believes such gains in these gold stocks could portend somewhat higher inflation ahead.    Newmont Mining gained 2 1/2 to 63 3/4, Homestake Mining rose 2 to 41 1/2, Echo Bay Mines added 1 1/2 to 24 3/8 and ASA advanced 1 7/8 to 68 3/4. Most other mining stocks also advanced.    Bethlehem Steel rose 1/4 to 18 3/8 on heavy volume. The steel concern reported second-quarter net income of $46.8 million compared with a loss of $23.8 million a year earlier. The company predicted a profitable third quarter on both an operating and net basis. It also reinstated the dividend on two of its preferred stock issues.    Borden climbed 3 to 62 5/8 on trading of 515,900 shares. The company plans to transfer its petrochemical complex in Geismer, La., and its polyvinyl chloride resin business to a master limited partnership in which a majority interest will be sold to the public.    Harry Segalas at L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin said forming the partnership for its basic chemical business is in keeping with Borden's strategy of recent years, which has been to focus more on high-return consumer goods. He added that the timing of Borden's move was good because the chemical industry is currently doing well.    Other food stocks were higher.    Gerber Products jumped 5 1/2 to 61 1/2 on more than 1.7 million shares after moving up 3 3/4 Tuesday. The stock has been running on a variety of takeover rumors since its president died earlier this month. Yesterday, E-II Holdings, Ralston Purina, Unilever N.V. and Quaker Oats were all rumored as possible suitors for Gerber. A corporate restructuring was also rumored.    Eastman Kodak moved up 3 1/4 to 93 7/8 in active trading. The film and photo equipment company said second-quarter net income rose to $361.9 million compared with a loss of $12.2 million a year earlier. The latest quarter includes gains of $31 million from property sales abroad and $17 million from a pension fund accounting change.    Chrysler rose 1 1/2 to 39 1/2. PaineWebber reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock and raised its 1987 and 1988 earnings estimates. General Motors and Ford Motor were slightly higher.    Augat slid 3 1/8 to 22 1/8. Late Tuesday, the company reported flat earnings of 16 cents a share for the second quarter.    Most other technology stocks remained in the doghouse despite the advance in the rest of the market. Unisys dropped 3/4 to 129 3/8, International Business Machines rose 1/4 to 161 1/2 and Digital Equipment eased 1/8 to 160 1/2. Apple Computer slipped 7/8 to 41 and Microsoft declined 1/4 to 99 1/4 in over-the-counter trading.    Publishing and media stocks continued to advance. Times Mirror gained 5 1/4 to 102.    Affiliated Publications ran up 5 to 75 1/2 after gaining 4 1/4 Tuesday. Traders said the interest is coming from the positive reaction to a planned initial offering of McCaw Cellular Communications.    Affiliated owns an indirect but substantial stake in McCaw Cellular Communications. The stock sale is planned for next month.    Other cellular stocks also climbed. Lin Broadcasting gained 2 3/4 to 47, Metro Mobile CTS added 2 to 31 3/4 and Cellular Communications rose 2 1/8 to 30 1/2.    Allegheny International rose 5/8 to 18 5/8 as more than 1.5 million shares changed hands. Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he holds a stake of almost 10% in Allegheny and is acquiring the stock for investment purposes only. The stock moved up 1 in active trading Tuesday.    Utah Power andamp; Light traded as high as 28 1/2 before closing up 2 1/2 at 27 in more active than usual trading. The Rocky Mountain utility and coal concern said it has received merger offers at prices that exceeded its market value of about $1.44 billion.    PacifiCorp, which eased 5/8 to 35 5/8, confirmed that it was engaged in merger talks with Utah Power, but hasn't made a formal acquisition proposal.    Crazy Eddie slid as low as 4 5/8 early yesterday on news that Entertainment Marketing had withdrawn its offer to negotiate an $8-a-share merger. The stock closed down 5/8 at 4 7/8 in active trading on the over-the-counter market.    Rent-A-Center gained 3 1/8 to 26 3/8 in OTC trading after the company agreed to be acquired by Thorn EMI for $27 a share.    Japanese stocks moved higher in U.S. trading after the Tokyo stock market closed higher. Matsushita Electric Industrial rose 8 3/4 to 168 1/4, Hitachi moved up 6 3/4 to 80 1/2, Sony added 3/4 to 31 1/8 and    Honda Motor gained 6 1/2 to 110.   Anheuser-Busch gained 2 1/4 to 38 1/2. Merrill Lynch raised its investment rating on the stock. </TEXT></DOC>
