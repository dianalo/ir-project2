It said there should be a law against such activities.   Pravda said it was natural that in the process of perestroika,or restructuring, such organizations would emerge. ``What is neededis legislative protection for perestroika and glasnost (greateropenness),'' it said. ``Society should be guaranteed protectionagainst extremism.''   It said organizations like the Democratic Union, which wasformed last May, can only harm the perestroika drive.   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, calledPravda's allegations ridiculous.   ``Ours is a very ordinary program,'' Mityunov said in atelephone interview. ``We want pluralism, equal opportunities forall.''   He said that if the Communist Party had a better program tooffer when voting time came, ``we will vote for the CommunistParty.''   The Democratic Union says it wants elections with competingparties, independent trade unions, a new constitution andwithdrawal of Soviet troops from East Europe and areas taken by theSoviet Union in World War II.   The group has affiliates throughout the country, but nomembership count was available.   Pravda said an analysis of Democratic Union documents circulatedin Leningrad showed the organization lifted more than two-thirds ofits program straight from the Communist Party itself on humanrights, political and economic reform, questions of education andculture, and relations with the church.   ``All this, however, is nothing more than camouflage,'' it said.``The true aim of the Democratic Union, as follows from itsdocuments, is to remove the Soviet Communist Party from thepolitical scene, and change the social system.''   The newspaper said that when new laws are drafted on the statusof public organizations, they should incorporate the right to takelegislative steps to ban the activities of extremist organizationslike the Democratic Union.   The Pravda article said Leningrad leaders of the DemocraticUnion, which claims about 2,000 members, were of dubious character.It said one leader once served prison time for burglary and asecond was convicted of extortion, swindling and currencyviolations.   Mityunov said, ``The Pravda article is very weak; there are nofacts to substantiate its allegations.''</TEXT></DOC>
