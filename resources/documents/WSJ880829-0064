While the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed Manville's plan in December 1986, the company can't emerge from bankruptcy-court protection until all appeals are exhausted, and there is still one appeal pending.    Earlier this summer, MacArthur Co., a Minneapolis building-materials distributor, asked the Supreme Court to review settlements totaling more than $700 million that Manville had negotiated with its insurers as part of the plan. The Supreme Court hasn't yet ruled whether it will review MacArthur's case.    Manville, a building and forest products concern, sought court protection from creditor lawsuits six years ago as a means to cope with thousands of lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from asbestos. The mineral, once widely used in piping and insulation, causes deadly lung cancers and other respiratory diseases that often don't show up for years. </TEXT></DOC>
