WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Suharto replaced nearly halfhis Cabinet and appointed more than a dozen military men in theirplace in a shake-up he said will bring new blood to the government.   ``The new Cabinet will ensure the continuation of past policiesas well as tackle the problem of regeneration (of Indonesia'sleadership),'' Suharto said after announcing the new lineup ontelevision Monday.   Among those replaced were Coordinating Minister for EconomicAffairs Ali Wardhana, Mines and Energy Minister Subroto and ForeignMinister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja.   Veteran Finance Minister Radius Prawiro, 59, will be sworn inWednesday to succeed Wardhana as economic czar, officials said.Indonesia is Asia's largest debtor and Wardhana last month saidJakarta had no intention of rescheduling its $42.1 billion foreigndebt.   Wardhana, a 60-year-old civilian technocrat credited withhelping to restore the economy in the last 20 years, said privatelyfor some time that he wished to retire, diplomatic sources said.   Subroto, who held the key energy portfolio for 10 years, isbeing replaced by Col. Ginandjar Kartasasmita, 47, a Japan-trainedformer head of the national investment board. He is regarded byforeign businessmen as a tough negotiator. Indonesia's economyremains heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports andSubroto represented the only Asian member of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries at OPEC deliberations and once servedas head of the cartel.   The new foreign minister is Ali Alatas, 55, who was ambassadorto the United Nations. Among Mochtar's unfinished business areambitions to play host to the next non-aligned summit and berecognized as a leader of the Third World.   Mochtar, 59, who leaves the Foreign Ministry job after 12 years,spearheaded his country's efforts to project itself on the worldstage after years of playing a minor role.   As expected, Gen. Benny Murdani, 55, replaced last month ascommander-in-chief of the armed forces, was named defense minister.Murdani has long been regarded as one of the country's mostpowerful figures.   Only 18 ministers of the previous 40-member Cabinet were givenassignments in the new one which has 41.   In addition to Murdani and the new armed forces chief, Gen. TrySutrisno, 53, who also holds Cabinet rank, 11 other active orretired military officers were appointed. They included Gen.Rudini, 58, as Home Affairs Minister and Admiral Sudomo, 61, asPolitical and Security Minister, both of whom are retired.   Suharto, 66, rules the world's fifth most populous nation _ 147million in 1980 _ with the backing of the armed forces.   The retired general, who is starting his fifth five-year term,took power in 1965 following the abortive communist coup. He is thethird longest-ruling leader in Asia after Singapore's Lee Kuan Yewand North Korea's Kim Il Sung.</TEXT></DOC>
