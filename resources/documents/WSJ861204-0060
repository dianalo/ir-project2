As previously reported, Viacom is the target of a proposed $3 billion management-led leveraged buyout. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, National Amusements said Viacom management's actions &quot;are contrary to the interests of all the nonmanagement shareholders,&quot; and reiterated past statements that National Amusements or a group led by National Amusements may make its own bid for Viacom, an entertainment and cable concern based here.    Viacom declined to comment. Sumner Redstone, chairman of Dedham, Mass.-based National Amusements couldn't be reached for comment. National Amusements is a leading theater chain.    As previously reported, Mr. Redstone retained Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. as an adviser in October. Wall Street sources speculated that Merrill Lynch may be willing to invest its own capital, joining with Mr. Redstone in a bid to compete with the Viacom management proposal. Merrill Lynch declined to comment on the speculation.    According to industry sources, Mr. Redstone has been unsuccessful in several attempts to enlist other entertainment companies, including Walt Disney Co., Gulf andamp; Western Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.'s Columbia Pictures unit in a competing bid for Viacom. Executives of the companies have indicated they don't want to pursue an offer hostile to Viacom management.    National Amusements' filing is the latest twist in a difficult road for Viacom management. Viacom initially said that the management group's bid was contingent upon being completed by the end of the year to take advantage of favorable tax rules that will disappear under tax-law changes next year.    That goal became impossible to achieve when Viacom's board rejected management's initial bid and the transaction had to be sweetened three times before it was finally accepted. The company filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC last week, but a Viacom spokesman said the company doesn't anticipate mailing a final prospectus to shareholders before January.    An investment banker said that Viacom's statement about completing the transaction by the end of the year &quot;appeared to be a case of pressuring the outside directors to approve the deal.&quot;    Viacom's stock has been gyrating in recent weeks as Wall Street questioned whether the management would be able to complete its bid. Two weeks ago, Viacom's stock sank several points when arbitragers became skittish because Viacom's buyout plan calls for financing to be arranged by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm being investigated in connection with the Ivan Boesky insider trading case.    Although Viacom's stock rebounded somewhat after the company's preliminary filing with the SEC last week, Wall Street sources said that Merrill Lynch and Mr. Redstone still don't believe that Viacom's management will be able to complete its financing, about half of which is in so-called junk bonds.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Viacom stock rose $1.25, to $42.75. Viacom management's current proposal is valued at about $45 a share, and Mr. Redstone acquired his latest holdings at prices of $39.50 to $41.75 a share.    Under antitrust law, National Amusements must get permission from the Federal Trade Commission and observe a waiting period before it can increase its stake above the 24.9% level that it currently has FTC permission to acquire.    Some on Wall Street were puzzled over National Amusements' latest action. An investment banker said that by increasing his stake at lower prices than the management offering is valued, Mr. Redstone &quot;may just be doing an arbitrage play, on the grounds that he can't lose -- he'll either get taken out by management or he'll just buy the company himself.&quot;    Although Mr. Redstone has privately expressed opposition to the Viacom management proposal, he hadn't publicly criticized the Viacom management prior to yesterday's SEC filing. In the filing, National Amusements criticized Viacom's &quot;poison pill&quot; plan, and said it has kept its Viacom stake under 20% thus far because Viacom hasn't indicated any intention of dismantling the plan. National Amusements said that in deciding whether to purchase additional Viacom shares, it will take into account whether Viacom dismantles the plan and other anti-takeover provisions.    The company also criticized other Viacom management actions in the filing, including Viacom's May purchase of investor Carl Icahn's 16.95% stake in the company -- characterized as &quot;greenmail&quot; by some analysts -- and Viacom's &quot;golden parachute&quot; severance agreements for its executives. </TEXT></DOC>
