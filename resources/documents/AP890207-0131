Despite uncertainties caused by the delay in approving Tower,however, the White House says that the former senator has beenactively involved in advising the president on budgetary and othermilitary concerns.   On Tuesday, senators and the White House said that the latest FBIreport on Tower showed that there was nothing to new allegations ofdrinking and womanizing to disqualify him from the job. The SenateArmed Services Committee, which last Thursday postponed a vote onits recommendation of Tower's nomination, is now expected to votethis week and send the matter to the chamber's floor.   But, as the process has drawn on, Pentagon officials who areholdovers from the Reagan administration complain that morale withinthe nation's military headquarters is falling and has createduncertainty within the department.   The officials, interviewed over the last week, insisted onanonymity because many want to remain in their current jobs or moveto another government post.   Although some officials say they are concerned the delay has leftthe Pentagon rudderless, others insist that Tower has maintained hisinfluence with the one man who really counts _ George Bush _ andthat the budget Bush will submit to Congress on Thursday willreflect Tower's input.   The White House says Tower has been a regular participant in thebudget meetings for several weeks and Bush is relying on hislongtime friend for military advice.   Bush has shown no inclination to back away from Tower but insteadhas defended him at every turn. At his news conference Monday, Bushsaid Tower should not have to withdraw his name based onunsubstantiated rumors about his personal life. The president saidhe fully endorsed his nominee.   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,has come under fire not only for allegations about his personallife, but also because of lucrative consulting work he has done fordefense contractors since he left the Senate.   Since Bush's inauguration Jan. 20, the Pentagon has been directedon an acting basis by William H. Taft IV, who was the deputy defensesecretary under Reagan. Tower has his own team, which he plans tomove in after his confirmation.   In the interim, Pentagon officials say there is uncertaintywithin the department over the budget, the possibility that thePentagon might lose influence within the administration because ofTower's problems, and worries over the Pentagon's image, alreadytarnished by a huge defense contracting fraud scandal.   By all accounts, Tower has been actively engaged in internalbudget debates with Bush aides for several days and, according toone official, has successfully blocked a proposal to hold defensespending to zero growth for the next four years.   The budget for next year, however, will be cut back to zerogrowth _ requiring $6.4 billion in cuts in budget authority _ eventhough no one at the White House knows the effect of that move onspecific weapon programs, the sources say.   ``Every new administration has a problem with the first budgetand the lack of time, but ... without a defense secretary or adefense team, the White House budget people talk in abstract numbersand have no idea what happens to specific programs when they cutmoney like this,'' said one official.</TEXT></DOC>
