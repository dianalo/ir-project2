Instead, the Pentagon will buy 300,000 tons of anthracite that it doesn't need and will spread it 20 feet high over 45 acres of land in eastern Pennsylvania, a monument to Congress and the coal lobby.    &quot;It's difficult to say which is stupider,&quot; says Jeffrey A. Jones, the Pentagon's director of energy policy. Or as Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) has put it: &quot;Buying more coal than we are going to use as a compromise to not shipping coal to Newcastle may be an improvement, but it is plain wrong.&quot;    Here is a case of Pentagon waste in which the Defense Department is the good guy. One of 107 items that President Reagan wants Congress to knock out of the fiscal 1988 budget, this program illustrates one reason the government finds it so tough to cut spending. Every program, no matter how outrageous, has a constituency and a champion somewhere in Washington.    Buried in the spending bill that Congress passed in December is a sentence that requires the Pentagon to buy 300,000 tons of anthracite this year. The provision is the legacy of a Pennsylvania congressman who retired nine years ago and testimony to the persistence of his former aide, now the lobbyist for the slowly dying U.S. anthracite industry. &quot;This is but one of many basic support programs for American industry,&quot; says Michael Clark, the lobbyist.    The Pentagon figures it will consume 443,000 tons of anthracite in the next four years, most of it in antiquated boilers that are in use only because congressional restrictions delayed conversion to other fuels. It already has 532,000 tons on hand or on the way -- not counting the 300,000 additional tons.    That 300,000 tons, for which the Pentagon expects to pay more than $20 million, represents about 10% of all the anthracite U.S. mines are expected to produce this year. Costly to mine, anthracite has steadily lost ground to cheaper bituminous coal and other fuels. The industry now employs about 2,000 miners. &quot;Wouldn't it be cheaper to somehow pay the miners not to mine the coal?&quot; wonders Mr. Jones, the Pentagon energy chief.    Perhaps. But that's not the way Congress works.    Back in 1962, a congressman from Pennsylvania coal country, Daniel Flood, convinced the Kennedy Administration that a good way to help the struggling American coal industry would be to order U.S. bases abroad to burn U.S. coal. Anthracite turned out to be a good substitute for local German coke.    Gradually, those old coke furnaces were replaced, and the Pentagon's appetite for coal diminished until 1972, when Congress ordered the Pentagon not to convert any more coal furnaces to oil. But as German communities grew increasingly unhappy with coal-generated air pollution, they began offering to heat U.S. bases with steam generated by local utilities. Local utilities already supply the bases with electricity and water. The Pentagon signed as many contracts as it could before Congress put a stop to that in 1984, amid concerns that the Germans were relying too heavily on Soviet natural gas. In fact, says Mr. Jones, Soviet gas generates only a small fraction of the steam supplied by the Germans.    By 1985, the Germans' environmental worries had escalated into a significant diplomatic issue. Finally, Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska), then chairman of the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee, engineered a compromise: Congress would stop forcing the Pentagon to burn coal overseas, and the Pentagon would burn more domestically.    That solved one problem but created another. The natural-gas industry realized that the more coal the Pentagon used, the less natural gas -- and its lobbyists leaped into action. &quot;We raised a lot of hell on Capitol Hill and talked with some of our friends,&quot; says Michael Baly, vice president of the American Gas Association.    In 1986, Congress again instructed the Pentagon to plan on burning more coal domestically, but only where coal is the most cost-effective fuel. With falling oil prices and deregulation of the natural-gas industry, coal isn't an attractive alternative in most places, Mr. Jones says. Where it is, bituminous is cheaper.    Rep. Flood, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to solicit illegal campaign contributions in 1980, is no longer in Washington. But others -- including Pennsylvania's two senators, Republicans Arlen Specter and John Heinz, Rep. Joseph McDade (R., Pa.) and Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.) -- stepped in.    So in the current fiscal year, for the third year in a row, Congress told the Pentagon to buy 300,000 tons of anthracite. Whether the purchase was meant to be part of Sen. Stevens's original compromise or not is in dispute, but it now appears to be.    Last December, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from the gas-producing state of Louisiana, urged the Senate Appropriations Committee to reduce the mandated purchase to 174,000 tons. It's wasteful, he declared. It isn't, replied Sen. Specter. &quot;It is true that this coal is being stockpiled, but it will be used,&quot; he insisted.    Sen. Stevens had the last word. &quot;We made the deal,&quot; he said. Sen. Johnston lost, 18-7. </TEXT></DOC>
