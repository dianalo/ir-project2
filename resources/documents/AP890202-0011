(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allen Ward has been barred fromcoaching his 10-year-old daughter's intramural basketball teambecause he has AIDS, but Ward hopes he won't be benched for long.   Ward was dismissed last week after only one game as a volunteercoach at Laurel Elementary School.   Already, he has launched a petition drive to get himselfreinstated and to protest the Franklin County Community Schoolspolicy dealing with AIDS.   ``The next step may be to keep me out of the school altogether,''Ward said Tuesday. ``My daughter will be there for four more yearsand if we let them defeat us now, I might not ever get to go to theschool.''   Ward, 37, contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome fromtainted blood products during open-heart surgery in 1984.   The disease, which attacks the body's immune system, istransmitted primarily through bodily fluids, such as during sexualcontact, intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but notthrough casual contact.   Ward volunteered to coach the team of fourth-, fifth- andsixth-graders when his daughter Dande decided to play at the school,60 miles southeast of Indianapolis.   ``I have no physical contact with them at all,'' Ward said. ``Imight throw a basketball to them, but if they're going to get itthat way, we're all in trouble.''   Principal Odell Calihan and Superintendent Don Jobe refused tocomment, saying only that they are following the school district'spolicy.   ``I know the situation, but I can't comment and I won't confirmany names,'' Jobe said when asked about Ward's dismissal.   ``It's just ignorance,'' Ward said. ``They haven't educatedthemselves on AIDS and how it's transmitted. But the way the diseaseis spreading, they ought to start getting educated. Four or fiveyears ago, I didn't think I'd ever come down with something likethis either.''   A similar argument was made after school authorities in Kokomobarred young Ryan White from his classes because he has AIDS. Hisfamily later moved to another town and his story was told recentlyin a television movie.   Under the Franklin County school district's AIDS policy approvedin September, employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus mustsubmit to a medical examination by a doctor selected by the schoolboard.   If an employee tests positive for the virus, a committee decideswhether the employee is an immediate public health threat. Thesuperintendent serves on the committee and selects its members,which include a public health physician and school officials.   ``If it's not discrimination, I don't know what is,'' Ward said.``The superintendent chooses who he wants on the committee, so hecan select people who support him. I can't even go to the meeting todefend myself.''   Ward said many of the basketball players' parents have signed apetition to reinstate him as coach.   ``I'd like to fight it and win it. But at this point in time,we've been struggling just to make ends meet and we're not going tobe able to put out a lot of money,'' said Ward, whose family liveson his Social Security payments and the salary from his wife'sfactory job.   Ward's wife, Theresa, has agreed to coach the team in themeantime, but school officials say she first must be tested for theAIDS virus. Until his case is resolved, Ward plans to attend gamesas a spectator.   ``My daughter is on the team and they can't keep me from going tothe games,'' he said. ``What I don't understand is what's thedifference if I'm sitting on the bench with the team as their coach,telling them when to go in and when to come out, or sitting in thebleachers as a parent with the other kids all around me, eating mypopcorn?''</TEXT></DOC>
