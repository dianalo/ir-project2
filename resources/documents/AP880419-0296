DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan on Tuesday took issue withcritics of administration space plans and asked Congress and theAmerican people to ``join me in making the long-term investmentrequired to advance U.S. leadership in space.''   ``Can we afford to stop our exploration and wait for others topass us?'' Reagan asked in a speech at the annualgovernment-industry dinner of the Electronic Industries Association.   ``The space station is vital to our leadership in space andcontributes to our pre-eminence in manned space flight,'' thepresident said. ``Some say we can't afford the space station.''   But, he asked, ``can we afford to jettison the next generationof technical spin-offs?''   ``Tonight I ask Congress and all the American people to join mein making the long-term investment required to advance U.S.leadership in space,'' Reagan said. ``We must begin that investmentby funding the increases I've proposed for our civil spaceprogram.''   Reagan also said it was administration policy ``to encourageprivate sector investment and involvement in outer space.''   ``We will help develop a highway to space by using privatelaunch services to the greatest extent feasible, and we are workingto win legislation to limit liability for commercial launchproviders,'' he said.   ``It's a future beyond the most distant star in our dreams thatbeckons us,'' Reagan told the electronics executives. ``And tothose who say it can't be reached, that it's impossible, I'd justpoint toward your industries and ask if a few years ago theythought what you are doing today would also be impossible.''   The president also put in a plug for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, or Star Wars, his proposal for a space-based defenseagainst nuclear missiles.   ``Five years ago I proposed SDI and, much to my satisfaction, wehave made tremendous progress in that research,'' he said. ``Wemust not stop dreaming because a few naysayers insist on limitingour options for a safe and secure future.''</TEXT></DOC>
