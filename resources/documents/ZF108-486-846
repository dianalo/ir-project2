(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Wave hello in styleandM;Hewlett-Packard claims that NewWave is a new way to do office work.andP;  It's thelatest attempt to provide the perfect graphical user interface and workingenvironment, and is an amalgam of the ideas behind GEM, Windows, theMacintosh desktop and nearly every other user interface released.andM;All of NewWave's concepts revolve around two items that are called Objectsand Tools.andP;  Tools are things that help you manage your work while Objects arethings you create - letters drawings and so on.andP;  I'm specifically not usingthe words 'program' and 'application' since NewWave completely hides both ofthese from users.andP;  The idea behind NewWave is that when you select, forexample, a letter, the word processing program is then automatically run andthe letter loaded for you.andP;  All the business of running the word processorfrom the DOS prompt, then finding and loading the letter file yourself arebanished.andP;  And it works very well too - if rather slowly.andM;NewWave is actually based on Microsoft Windows, the graphical front-end toDOS, and a full copy of Windows must be installed before NewWave can be.andO;More important, if you don't have a 286 or 386-based PC with 13Mb free on thehard disk and over 2.5Mb of additional memory, you can stop reading now.andO;These are the application's minimum requirements.andP;  In practice I'd recommenda speedy 386 machine with as fast a hard disk as you can lay your hands on.andM;Installing the contents of the six high density disks takes around an hour -especially if you install Windows and then decide to read the NewWavemanuals, since new video drivers have to be used and Windows re-installed.andP;  Iset up Windows/386 which fooled NewWave's installation program into thinkingWindows wasn't present on the hard disk.andP;  The reason is a little routine thatsearches for the file WIN.CO, - this works fine in Windows/286 but not inWindows/386 where it's called WIN86.COM.andP;  The offending file renamed, Icontinued.andM;There are a number of other changes that must be made to set up your systembefore going ahead, but these are reported within the installation programand outlined to a considerable degree in the manuals.andM;NewWave Office presents a very friendly icon-based display of your personal(individual users can have a name and password) office.andP;  The basic Tools areFile Drawer, Printer, Waste Basket, Dictionaries, Agent and DOSFile Attach.andO;These are NewWave's applications and are distinguished as their icons arethree dimensional in appearance.andM;The File Drawer manages your files (properly referred to as Objects), and thePrinter lets you print the contents of an Object, while Waste Basket deletesit.andP;  Two dictionaries are supplied (American and UK English) and these can becustomized and used to spell check any Object's textual contents.andP;  The Agenticon isn't implemented in this version of NewWave but, as with the Macintosh,Agents automate tasks - and will be fully implemented in NewWave v3.andP;  There'sno reference to it in the documentation.andP;  Finally, DOSFile Attach allows youto convert a number of existing files into NewWave Objects.andM;Windows 3 in August, will be faster thanks to Windows 3's better memorymanagement.andP;  One of the attractions for large companies is that NewWave isn'tonly a DOS product.andP;  Hewlett-Packard will be providing versions of NewWave torun under DOS, OS/2 with Presentation Manager, and Unix with OSF's Motif bythe end of the year.andP;  This potentially puts it in a very good place to becomea multi-platform frontend standard.andP;  At the moment, however, applications arevery scarce - although many of the larger software houses, such as Lotus,plan to release NewWave-specific versions before the end of this year.andP;  Inthe meantime, NewWave is an excellent front-end but takes the alreadysluggish performance of Windows and winds it down to a just usable crawl.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
