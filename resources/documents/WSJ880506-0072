Executives of Home Box Office and Fox, a unit of News Corp., acknowledged an agreement was near but declined to elaborate. At an analysts meeting Monday, Home Box Office's chief executive officer, Michael Fuchs, said his company is also talking to MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios about a long-term contract to buy movies.    The agreement between HBO and Fox would run for three years and replace a nonexclusive agreement that is expiring. Because the new agreement would mean Fox couldn't sell its movies to any other pay-TV network, some industry executives regard it as another potential blow to HBO's smaller rival, Showtime/The Movie Channel. Home Box Office, with over 20 million subscribers, is about three times the size of Showtime, and movies are considered a key lure for new subscribers.    In the past, HBO and Showtime each purchased movies from all the studios and aired them on their respective networks. But about three years ago, Showtime decided it would have an advantage if it offered movies that weren't available on HBO. It signed exclusive agreements with studios that included Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Co's Touchstone Films unit.    In response, HBO became more aggressive with studios as their pay television contracts began to expire, outbidding Showtime in two key cases. For example, when Paramount's contract with Showtime came up for renegotiation last year, HBO offered the studio significantly more money to switch to HBO.    HBO also signed a long-term nonexclusive agreement with Warner Communications Inc.'s Warner Bros unit. But that agreement provides that Showtime can buy Warner movies, too, if it decides to change its strategy of exclusivity.    Yesterday, a top executive at Viacom Inc., Showtime's parent, indicated his company may start buying some movies even if HBO has them. &quot;Showtime doesn't have to be 100% exclusive,&quot; he said. &quot;We just believe we need some exclusivity to differentiate Showtime from HBO.&quot; He also said Showtime isn't willing &quot;to pay any price for exclusivity.&quot; HBO, he noted, is reportedly paying about twice as much per movie to Fox as it would under a nonexclusive pact.    The Viacom executive also said the HBO-Fox pact wouldn't hurt Showtime &quot;because there is plenty of other movie product out there&quot; from smaller movie studios. Showtime has exclusive agreements with smaller producers such as Orion Pictures Corp., Weintraub Entertainment Group Inc., and Imagine Films Inc. And giant Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., which has nonexclusive agreements with HBO, is expected to start new pay network negotiations soon with both Showtime and HBO.    An MCA executive said his company is talking with both HBO and Showtime, but is also talking to &quot;other parties,&quot; such as the broadcast networks and advertiser-supported cable networks. There is some speculation that MCA's Universal Studios may bypass the pay networks altogether in the next round of movie rights sales. </TEXT></DOC>
