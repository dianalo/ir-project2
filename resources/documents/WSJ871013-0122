Growth of 0.7% would put French economic expansion for the first half at an annual rate of 1.4% before compounding. In its recent draft budget, the Economics Ministry said it expected GDP, which measures a nation's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, to expand about 1.5% this year.    The state-run institute said it revised downward the second-quarter figure because of a change in the price weightings for foreign trade. It said the latest figure also reflected balance-of-payments data that weren't previously available, as well as capital-investment results.    The institute also confirmed its previous estimate that first-quarter GDP was unchanged from the 1986 fourth quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
