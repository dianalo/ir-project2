The Washington Post said in its report that it was notimmediately able to determine who called the officers back or why.   The detectives went to the hotel Thursday to investigate acomplaint from hotel officials that former city employee CharlesLewis had offered drugs to a hotel maid. They left the hotel after``somebody called them back downstairs,'' the Post reported, quotingcity government sources.   An internal police investigation is under way in an effort todetermine whether Lewis was involved in any drug activity, howpolice handled the complaint and why the mayor was at the hotel,sources said. Barry is expected to be interviewed as part of theprobe.   Traces of cocaine were discovered in the room at the hotel,located in the northwest section of the city, and an unnameddistrict source said Barry visited the hotel six times last week.   But the chemical tests did not indicate whether the cocaine hadbeen in the room recently. Barry has denied any wrongdoing.   ``I would never knowingly associate with anybody using drugs ordealing with drugs,'' the mayor said through a spokesman. ``Under nocircumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.''   The detectives who backed off from the undercover drug buy wereworking out of the 3rd District under Deputy Chief Edward J.Spurlock, sources told the Post. Assistant Chief Issac M. Fulwoodtold officers that Spurlock offered to lie to reporters who calledhim about the actions of the detectives, including stating falselythat no detectives from his district responded to the hotel, thepaper reported.   Spurlock told reporters Thursday night that he had no knowledgeof the situation.</TEXT></DOC>
