Kroger officials said Thursday that the firings of 300 of its800 corporate employees would enable it to save $13 million a yearand defend the company from takeover attempts.   The workers were told only hours earlier that they would be letgo, although rumors of mass layoffs had circulated all week. Allwere covered by severance packages that provided up to nine months'pay, plus insurance and other benefits, Kroger said.   ``They're not finished yet,'' said Scott Hatch, who still hashis job in the management information systems department. ``It'slike watching a horror film and knowing it's coming, but you don'tknow when.''   ``Seeing your friends go is the hardest part. There are a lot ofdepressed people right now,'' said Sharon Hillenbrand, who wasfired from her job in the transportation department. ``It was not asurprise.''   As part of the restructuring, Kroger also plans to payshareholders a special $48 a share dividend _ $40 in cash and abond it values at $8.   The supermarket company also has plans to sell certainbusinesses in order to help cut costs and streamline operations.   Kroger last month proposed the restructuring to fend offunwanted takeover offers from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a NewYork investment firm, and the Haft family, which controls retailerDart Group Inc.   Kohlbeg Kravis on Tuesday raised its offer to $5.03 billion, or$64 a share in cash and securities, and proposed to buy Krogerwhether or not it restructured. Kroger had not responded publiclyto Kohlberg's offer by late Thursday.   Dart Group, which last month began the bidding competition forKroger, stated Wednesday it was interested in working with Krogerto enhance the restructuring by providing more equity _ a statementsome analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance to help Krogerfend off Kohlberg Kravis.   The Hafts, of Landover, Md., opened the Kroger bidding Sept. 19with an unsolicited offer of $55 per share, or $4.32 billion. TheHafts have not increased their offer.</TEXT></DOC>
