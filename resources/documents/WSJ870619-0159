Officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Toshiba Machine Co., already accused of illegally exporting four metalworking machines and related computer programs to the Soviets between 1982 and June 1984, also admitted that it exported four more similar machines sometime in 1984.    The sophisticated milling equipment apparently has allowed the Soviets to produce quieter attack submarines.    A MITI spokesman said the government wouldn't punish the company for the newest violations because it already has imposed on Toshiba Machine a one-year ban against all exports to Communist-bloc countries.    Two Toshiba Machine executives were indicted June 15 for violating Japan's foreign-exchange control law in the earlier incidents.    Separately, Toshiba Corp. and Sharp Corp. said they won't divert personal-computer exports to the European Community to try to compensate for losses caused by punitive tariffs levied by the U.S. The Japanese electronics makers said their personal-computer exports to the EC's 12 member countries will remain within levels set before the U.S. imposed 100% import duties in April on Japanese color televisions, desk-top computers and power tools. </TEXT></DOC>
