William Keating, 62, president and chief executive officer ofthe Detroit Newspaper Agency, which oversees the joint businessoperations of The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press, hasdemonstrated to federal lawyers that he served more briefly thanpublic records stated as a director of the parent company of thefailed thrift, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sourcesit said were familiar with the case.   The lawsuit filed in Phoenix by the Resolution Trust Corp., thefederal agency responsible for cleaning up the thrift industry,accuses Charles Keating and other senior company officers ofdevising a scheme to loot money from Lincoln Savings and Loan ofIrvine, Calif.   Charles Keating, his son and five other top company executivesare accused under civil fraud and racketeering statutes.   William Keating is not accused of fraud and racketeering, but isnamed in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breachof fiduciary duty.   William Keating, a former congressman, has said he served on theboard of directors of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix fromFebruary to August 1986. The newspaper reported that he had said heleft the board because he didn't have time to travel from his homein Cincinnati to board meetings in Phoenix.   The federal lawsuit said William Keating served on the board ofAmerican Continental until March 1987. American Continental filedfor bankruptcy protection the next month. A day after the filing,federal regulators seized Lincoln, whose losses of federallyinsured deposits are projected to reach $2 billion.   The newspaper said William Keating declined to be interviewedconcerning the lawsuit. A secretary in his Detroit office said hewas out of town on a business trip Monday and unavailable forcomment.   William Keating's lawyer, Chester Kamin of Chicago, would sayonly that ``we're taking steps'' to remove William Keating from thelawsuit, the newspaper said.   The Detroit News said federal officials were expected to dropKeating from the lawsuit within days, but were expected to reservethe right to reinstate him if warranted by new facts.   Kate Speers, a spokeswoman for Resolution Trust Corp. inWashington, said Monday she could not immediately provide commenton the Detroit News story.

Also involved in the controversy are five U.S. senators whoreceived campaign contributions from American Continental. Thesenators are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee andthe FBI for their involvement on Lincoln's behalf.   The newspaper said there is no evidence William Keating receivedany large amounts of money from American Continental other thanfees paid for attending directors' meetings. It said payments todirectors ranged from $3,500 to $7,000 per meeting between 1985 and1987.
