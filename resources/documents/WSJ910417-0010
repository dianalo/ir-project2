The parties broke off talks five hours before the strikedeadline of 12:01 a.m. EDT today, railroad officials said.The sides had continued negotiations yesterday in alast-ditch effort to resolve work-rules and otherdifferences.</LP><TEXT>   In one of the final negotiating sessions, the railroadsmade a new proposal involving &quot;significant movement towardthe union position,&quot; but to no avail, an industry spokesmansaid. A union official said the unions made at least one newproposal, too.   The walkout could close the nation's railroads for thefirst time since a three-day nationwide strike in 1982. Thestrike was expected to begin at 7:01 a.m. local time,according to Fred Hardin, president of the UnitedTransportation Union.   After the 12:01 a.m. strike deadline arrived, Mac Fleming,president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance Way Employees,maintained that the railroads had broken off negotiations, atleast with his union. He added that it was evident that therailroads want Congress to impose on the unions the termsrecommended by the emergency board. Mr. Fleming said there is&quot;little hope for a negotiated settlement&quot; unless Congressallows the unions to conduct a strike.   Without a settlement, Larry McFather, president of theBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, told a news conference:&quot;In my opinion, we'll probably shut the whole system down.&quot;   Union leaders said that in a strike, they would take theunusual step of refraining from striking rail-commuteroperations, which otherwise could affect 100,000 commuters,many in the Chicago area. That restraint seemed aimed atlimiting public anger over a rail strike, and blunting anyresultant move by Congress to enact into law recommendationsmade in January by a presidential emergency board. If there'sa walkout, however, the railroads are expected to stopcommuter trains.   Late yesterday in Chicago, a Circuit court judge orderedthe Chicago andamp; North Western Railroad to keep its commuterlines operating in event of a nationwide walkout, accordingto the Associated Press. The railroad is a unit of CNW Corp.   A White House spokesman said the administration wasprepared to work with Congress on speedy legislation &quot;toimpose a settlement&quot; and end any strike. Some administrationofficials expect Democrats in Congress to be receptive tolegislation enacting a presidential emergency board'srecommendations shortly after a strike begins.   The emergency board's recommendations for wages, work-rulechanges and other provisions, unlike many past board urgings,are considered unsatisfactory by many unions while generallyfavored by rail employers.   While the rail unions have sometimes been happy to seeCongress end strikes by enacting emergency-boardrecommendations into law, they don't want that action thistime. The board's report, which is eagerly supported by theBush administration, included a 20% increase in the mileagethat train crews must travel to receive a day's pay, as wellas other work-rules changes sought by the railroads.   The recommendations also included letting either partyseek local-level binding arbitration on the railroads' bid totrim crew sizes and reduce many work restrictions -- a stepthat some unions fear would mean widespread cuts in crewsize. The mileage and other changes could wipe out any gainsfrom board recommendations for a series of lump-sum wagepayments and increases, the unions say, and the board's planwould allow part of those wage rises to be used to cover therailroads' increased health-insurance costs.   With eight of 11 negotiating unions still at odds with therailroads, Mr. McFather said, their members want meaningfulwage increases after eight years of concessions.   &quot;The time has come that there has to be a better way thansimple givebacks,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;I don't think we'refar apart, but the carriers are not wanting to move at all.&quot;   Railroads, for their part, say they need more flexibilityand efficiency and that they must hold down wages andclimbing health costs, to improve further already-improvingearnings and to make the industry competitive with truckers.   Instead of adopting the board's report, the unions wantCongress to convene a separate panel to study the dispute andmake its own recommendations. Asked about prospects for thataction, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, said it would be one of theoptions for Congress to consider. Others would includeenacting the emergency board recommendations and setting anew cooling-off period while both sides continue bargaining,he said. His committee's transportation and hazardousmaterials subcommittee plans an early-morning hearing today.   The railroads and unions have been negotiating for threeyears. When the board issued its report in January, a 30-daycooling-off period ensued, to end Feb. 15. Both sides thenagreed, as the Persian Gulf war was raging, to put off anystrike until 12:01 a.m. today.   On the unions' plans to avoid striking commuter-raillines, Mr. McFather said: &quot;We're not trying to cause chaoswith the traveling public. Our fight is really with thefreight railroads.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
