President Barber Conable said the bank will triple its lending toforestry programs and has established a new gas development unit toencourage developing nations to use natural gas instead of fuelsthat create more pollutants linked to the rise in world temperatures.   ``We do not believe that development and environmental protectionare mutually hostile objectives,'' he told an environmentalconference sponsored by the Japanese government. ``One cannot besacrificed for the other.''   Mostafa Tolba, head of the United Nations Environment Program,told 60 officials and experts at the meeting that about 50 millionpeople around the world may become ``environmental refugees''because of global warming.   The Earth's warming has been linked to gases such as carbondioxide, methane and freon, by-products of the burning of fossilfuels and other industrial and agricultural processes. Released intothe atmosphere, they trap heat like a greenhouse, preventing it fromescaping.   If the release of gases continues at current levels, the Earth'stemperature is likely to rise by 2.5 degrees to 8 degrees(Fahrenheit) over the next 50 years, scorching parts of the worldand melting polar ice, flooding densely populated coastal areas,Tolba said.   Low-lying developing countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt,Indonesia and Pacific islands are likely to be particularly hardhit, he said.   The conference, on global warming and environmental protection indeveloping nations, is part of a new Japanese government policy ofbecoming more involved in international environmental issues.   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, welcoming the conferees Monday,pledged that Japan will provide about $2.25 billion in specialenvironmental loans over the next three years and will work todevelop environmentally appropriate technology.   Japanese environmental groups have criticized the conference,saying it is likely to whitewash Japanese links to environmentaldegradation, and have protested the government's decision to excludeprivate groups from the sessions.   In separate demonstrations Monday, several environmental andcitizens groups protested Japan's status as the largest importer ofwood from endangered tropical forests and its alleged export ofpolluting industries to the Third World.   A coalition of groups held its own three-day ``people's forum''on environmental issues before the government conference. The 1,000participants called for more careful citizen monitoring of Japan'soverseas aid programs.   ``Under the name of `environmental aid,' Japan is promotingcertain types of tree plantations, such as eucalyptus plantations innortheastern Thailand, that are proven to destroy the naturalenvironment and ruin local forest-dwelling communities,'' saidSurisuwan Kuankachorn of Thailand's Project for Ecological Recovery,a participant in the forum.   ``The best thing that Japan can do for the outside world ... isto listen to the real needs of the people in other countries, notjust Japanese companies,'' he said.   Conable said the World Bank has become ``committed toenvironmental issues'' and is increasingly integrating environmentalvalues into its development programs.   The bank, the leading institutional supporter of Third Worlddevelopment, has been criticized for funding projects, such as damsand roads, that have damaged the environment and disruptedtraditional living patterns.   ``We are changing direction, but must turn very slowly, like anocean liner,'' Conable said.   He said the bank also would boost funding for a tradiionalemphasis, family planning, from $500 million in the past five yearsto $800 million in the 1990-92 period.   He said the world's population, currently about 5 billion, willgrow to 6 billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossilfuels blamed for atmospheric warming.   Tolba said all countries must cooperate in dealing with globalwarming. But developed nations, he said, are responsible forproduction of three-quarters of the ``greenhouse'' gases.   ``The challenge before Japan, the United States and East and WestEurope is to decrease energy needs, increase energy conservation andefficiency, and keep pace with an accelerating global economy,'' hesaid.   ``But we have to be quite objective. If the industrialized worldmeets the challenge, the results of its efforts could be completelywiped out if China and India continue to burn their huge reserves ofcoal. And they will continue to do so unless they are assistedfinancially and technologically to use alternatives.''</TEXT></DOC>
