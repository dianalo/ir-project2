It has long been recognized that before such a laboratoryfacility is constructed, it must be demonstrated that laboratory conditionscan be created that will, with high probability, lead to high gain ifa driver of sufficient energy is built and that such a facility can bebuilt at reasonable cost. Thus, the two major aspects of the US programaddress target physics and driver development. Four main driver candidatesare actively being pursued: solid state lasers (principally Nd:glass),KrF gas lasers, light ion beams (Li ions accelerated by ion diodes),and heavy ion beams )A {approximately}200, accelerated by linear inductionaccelerator). The target physics aspect of the program is further dividedinto indirect and direct drive targets. In indirect drive targets thedriver beams are aimed at a material near the capsule to generate x-rays,which then are absorbed in the fusion capsule ablator to produce theimplosion. In direct-drive targets, the driver beams are aimed at thesurface of the capsule. However, even in this case it should be recognizedthat the beam energy is deposited in the plasma surrounding the capsule,then transported to the ablation surface by electrons. Experimental targetphysics results recently obtained, principally for indirect-drive targets,have led to high confidence that a suitably-shaped 10 MJ pulse is sufficientto achieve high-gain and yields of 100 to 1000 MJ will result. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
