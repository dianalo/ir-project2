On other futures markets, heating oil plunged the2-cents-a-gallon daily limit as energy futures sagged; stock-indexfutures dropped along with stock prices; livestock and meat futureswere mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.   Copper settled 0.2 cent to 4.5 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in December at $1.196 a pound, its lowest daily closesince Aug. 16.   The sell-off largely reflected selling by investment funds amidindications that the market is shifting away from the tight-supplysituation that has existed since mid-summer.   ``This was a complete continuation of fund liquidation,'' saidTony Ellis, a broker with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in NewYork. ``It was one of the quieter days that I can remember as faras trade business is concerned.''   A fundamental backdrop for the market's decline was establshedlast week when miners at Canada's Highland Valley copper mine endeda 3{-month strike and Mexican officials indicated that the Cananeacopper mine, that country's largest, would likely reopen soon aftera two-month shutdown.   Analysts also traced Monday's weakness to the London MetalExchange's report that warehouse stocks of copper registered withthe exchange had shruken by 4,800 metric tons last week, a muchsmaller decline than traders had expected.   Precious metals futures edged lower on New York's Comex in dulltrading. Gold settled 30 cents to 50 cents lower with December at$370.20 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.3 cent lower withDecember at $5.138 a troy ounce.   The sharp drop in oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchangewas mainly a technical affair inspired by the November heating-oilcontract's dip below 60 cents a gallon, said Jerry Samuels, ananalyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   Selling accelerated after crude oil futures broke through $20 abarrel, a point of strong psychological support, he said.   A trade journal's report of continued OPEC overproductionprompted further selling.   Heating oil for December delivery fell the 2-cent daily limitwhile the limitless November contract plungged 2.02 cents a gallon.   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 8 cents to 36 cents lowerwith November at $18.59 a barrel; heating oil was 1.02 cents to2.02 cents lower with November at 58.42 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1.03 cents to 1.10 cents lower with November at 53.48cents a gallon.   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago MercantileExchange in line with stock prices after last week's strong rallyshowed signs of fading.   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled 2.50 points lower at 347.95.Each point is worth $500.   Cattle futures climbed on the Chicago Merc following Friday'squarterly Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, whichshowed fewer cattle on feedlots than the market had expected.   Hog futures also advanced while frozen pork bellies retreatedahead of the USDA's monthly cold-storage report, which showed 32.8million pounds of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as ofSept. 30 compared with 31.1 million pounds on the same date a yearearlier.   Live cattle futures finished .15 cent to .45 cent higher withDecember at 75.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .37cent higher with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .05cent to .82 cent higher with December at 47.62 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .37 cent lower with Februaryat 52.57 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed on the ChicagoBoard of Trade with prices for near-month corn and wheat deliveriessupported by export demand and other contracts weakened by harvestpressure.   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to } cent higher withDecember at $4.07} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2{ cents lower withDecember at $2.41\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higherwith December at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 2{cents higher with November at $5.63 a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
