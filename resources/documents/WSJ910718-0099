But that wasn't business asusual: The customers, readers of about 70 weekly newspapersfrom Birmingham, Ala, to Boise, Idaho, are homosexual.   Columbia House, a compact-disk club that is jointlyoperated by Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp., began itscampaign in the gay press because readers of the selectedpapers tend to be &quot;upscale and cutting edge,&quot; says LindaAndersen, advertising vice president for the club. She adds:&quot;It's just another vehicle to get at a market that's logicalfor us.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   That logic is starting to influence a growing number ofbusinesses. &quot;We've enjoyed a big increase in ad linage,&quot; saysKen Newelt, marketing director for the national gay newsmagazine the Advocate. He says linage in the May 1991 issuerose 50% from a year earlier -- mostly because of new ads forHollywood feature films and general-interest home videos.Persistence was key. &quot;It has a lot to do with us hammeringaway at people,&quot; Mr. Newelt says.   Ads are also selling briskly at Genre, a national gaylife-style magazine that published its second issue in June.Unlike the Advocate, Genre is entirely glossy and won'taccept personal or phone-sex ads. Because of that policy, aGenre spokeswoman says, the magazine racked up 18 pages ofnational ads for its first issue and 25 pages for its second.Among the big advertisers: Atlantic Records and publisherPrentice-Hall.   Of the businesses now reaching out to homosexuals, some,like Columbia House, are departing from past practices.Others advertised to gay people in the late 1970s and early1980s and then retreated, especially during the onset of theAIDS epidemic.   In the late '80s, &quot;I sat around twiddling my thumbs,&quot; saysRivendell Marketing Co. President Joe Di Sabato, who sells adspace in the gay press. &quot;I couldn't even get meetings withpeople. These days, I still have a hard time selling, but Iget lots of meetings.&quot;   As far as the resistance is concerned, &quot;Homophobia iscertainly part of the problem,&quot; Mr. Di Sabato says. &quot;If thiswere any other market in the world, I'd be beating them offwith a stick.&quot;   Certainly, most corporations aren't yet banging down doorsto sell to gay people. Among the nay-sayers is Carter-WallaceInc. The company's Trojan condoms brand prefers advertisingin mainstream men's magazines such as Details instead of thegay press -- even though studies show that homosexuals usemore condoms per capita. &quot;Gay people don't read differentmagazines than other people do,&quot; says Mark Klein, vicepresident of marketing for Carter-Wallace.   Others are reluctant to market to gay people because theysay they lack sufficient marketing data. While there aredirect-mailing lists for all sorts of categories, such asdoctors who fly airplanes, there aren't corresponding listsfor gay people. That's because homosexuals often won'tidentify themselves as such, fearing discrimination. &quot;It'shard to convince clients to market to gays because therearen't more numbers,&quot; says Jack Sansolo, the openly gaypresident of the U.S. division of the Hill, Holliday,Connors, Cosmopulos advertising agency.   Still, in gay households, &quot;you're talking about two peoplewith good jobs, lots of money and no dependents. This is adream market,&quot; Mr. Di Sabato says.   Some companies don't need more convincing than that.Midway Airlines, which has been operating under bankruptcyproceedings and trying to woo new customers in its coreChicago market, has been taking out full-page ads in the gaypress there.   Similarly, the liquor industry, traditionally the biggestadvertiser to the gay community, is increasing its pitch tohomosexuals. While big names like Absolut and Remy Martincognac routinely take out full-page ads in the gay press,smaller brands are showing renewed interest. Stolichnayavodka, which stopped advertising to niche markets last year,says it will resume once it completes its current nationalcampaign to make its image more hip. &quot;We can't wait to goback&quot; to the gay press, says Michael Edmeades ofStolichnaya's New York-based ad agency, Calet, Hirsch andamp;Spector.   Finlandia vodka, a smaller brand that moves in the shadowsof Absolut, is targeting gay people in an effort to gainmarket share in Chicago. It doesn't advertise in the gaypress; but for the past year it has been offering a specialdeal at about 90 of the city's gay bars: From each Finlandiasale, 50 cents goes to the Howard Brown Foundation, whichresearches AIDS. The promotion is going so well that HeubleinInc., Finlandia's importer, says it may try it in othermarkets.   Some of the corporate awareness of homosexuals has comefrom business moves within the gay community, such as issuinggay-oriented credit cards. About 500 people have signed upfor a &quot;Pride Card&quot; MasterCard through the Pride Foundation, anonprofit gay organization in Seattle. Elsewhere, the DallasGay Alliance Credit Union, believed to be the only creditunion of its kind in the country, this year offered its ownMasterCard; colored pink and gray, the card features the word&quot;gay&quot; and a pink triangle, the symbol the Nazis used to brandhomosexuals during the Holocaust. So far, about 300 peoplefrom as far away as Maine and Hawaii have signed up, bringingthe credit union's total membership to about 750.   The news has turned heads. After reading about the newDallas credit card in his local newspaper, Skipp Shimek,marketing director for Target Management Inc., called up tohawk his wares: customized long-distance calling cards. &quot;Gaypeople spend money, too. And I'm a businessman,&quot; says Mr.Shimek, national marketing director for the privately held,Fort Pierce, Fla.-based telecommunications company.   He says he's not afraid of a backlash from heterosexualcustomers, such as the letter campaign American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Corp. endured last month after it announced a &quot;GayAwareness Week&quot; for its employees. Angry letters &quot;wouldn'tbother me in the least,&quot; says Mr. Shimek, who hopes to strikea deal with the credit union once it signs up at least 1,000members.   At least one bank is also reaching out to gay people.Consider U.S. Bancorp, a Portland, Ore., bank holding companywith approximately $19 billion in assets. As part of itsChristmas charity program, the company's U.S. Bank ofWashington unit took out a full-page advertisement in aconcert publication for the gay Seattle Men's Chorus.   The response: one critical letter, one angry phone calland 50 letters of praise -- including several promises toopen new accounts. Says Molly Reed, a vice president andmanager of community relations for U.S. Bank of Washington:&quot;It turned out to be a very wise marketing move.&quot;   The bank may increasingly target part of its financialservices guide at homosexuals, says advertising manager KerryNisco. Among the ideas: The guide might include a picture ofa gay couple applying for a home loan. &quot;This bank has steppedup to the fact that diversity exists in the marketplace,&quot;says Ms. Nisco. &quot;We are going to be a leader in the field andtake some risks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
