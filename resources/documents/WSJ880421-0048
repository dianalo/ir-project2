For the quarter ended March 27, 1987, net income was $21.9 million, or 53 cents a share, on sales of $522.3 million.    Harris, a Melbourne, Fla., supplier of communication and semiconductor systems, attributed the results to improved profits in its semiconductor, communications, government and business-products sectors. However, Harris said one weaker area was information systems, which had lower sales and a loss for the quarter.    For the nine months, net rose 18% to $68.8 million, or $1.70 a share, from $58.3 million, or $1.42 a share. Sales were $1.52 billion, compared with $1.52 billion for the same period a year ago, Harris said. </TEXT></DOC>
