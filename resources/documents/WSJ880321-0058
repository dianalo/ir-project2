Analysts say there will be some redemptions as investors write checks to cover 1987 tax liabilities. But many doubt that those redemptions will approach last year's April-May level of $3 billion. Currently, there are $52 billion in long-term municipal-bond mutual funds.    Last year's redemption wave contributed to a spring slump in muni prices. While all fixed-income prices headed lower in that period, the selling by funds to meet investor redemption requests was more prevalent in the muni sector than in the other general fixed-income sectors.    Muni funds are more prone than other fixed-income funds to tax-related redemptions because they are in large part the domain of smaller individual investors, many of whom can write checks on their holdings.    &quot;I'm sure that a few million (dollars of spring 1987) redemptions were for paying taxes, but I think only a small part of the total redemptions,&quot; says Guy Wickwire, a portfolio manager for Boston-based Fidelity Investments. Mr. Wickwire cites last spring's general upward spike in interest rates as the main cause of fund redemptions.    Donna Avedisian, senior municipal strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, also doubts that redemptions this spring will match last year's. Ms. Avedisian says individuals' federal income-tax bills last year after withholding by the government totaled about $47 billion. Her firm estimates the total of those bills this year at about $40 billion, compared with $26 billion in 1986.    Peter Gordon, director of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.'s municipal division in Baltimore, says he has increased municipal-fund cash positions because of &quot;the outlook on the market,&quot; and not because of investor tax-related redemptions.    Mr. Gordon holds a 20% cash position in the firm's general municipal fund, up from 4% a year ago, and he holds a 10% cash position in the high-yield municipal fund, up from the 7% of last year.    T. Rowe Price expects long-term Treasury yields to be at 9 1/4% by year end, up from 8 1/2% currently, and federal funds to be at 7 1/2%, up from 6 1/2% recently. Mr. Gordon suggests that investors might be better off with heavier weightings in short-term funds. Still, the firm estimates that $50 million to $120 million of assets in its tax-exempt money fund will be withdrawn as investors pay tax bills.    Ian Mackinnon, fixed-income director at Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., says his tax-exempt funds hold a cash position of 10% to 12%, up from 5% in April 1987.    &quot;It happens every year, and this year won't be any different,&quot; Mr. Mackinnon says of investors using tax-exempt investment funds to pay taxes. But &quot;we're not expecting the magnitude we saw last year.&quot;    Vanguard's higher tax-exempt cash position also reflects a market view. Says Mr. Mackinnon: &quot;We believe rates are going up. We think it's prudent to hold higher cash in general, if only to accommodate a significant volatile base of shareholders interested in doing asset allocation and moving money from long to short and fine-tuning positions.&quot;    Some industry officials have advocated that mutual funds hold 10% or so of assets in cash. That would accommodate a more volatile shareholder base and guard against having to sell assets in declining markets to meet redemption requests.    Marilyn Cohen, president of Capital Insight in Beverly Hills, Calif., observes that in the muni market, there is &quot;significantly less liquidity than a year ago this time. There are fewer dealers around now.&quot; So if many funds and others rush to unload municipal bonds, she wonders, &quot;Who are they going to sell to?&quot;    Today's higher cash positions -- representing huge potential buying power -- could affect the secondary tax-exempt bond market in another way: If put back into long-term munis, the funds could fuel a significant market climb.    Furthermore, if tax liabilities are high at April 15, muni funds could be the focus of a surge of interest thereafter, as investors try to shelter income from 1988 taxes. &quot;That should mean good demand&quot; for municipals after April 15, says Merrill's Ms. Avedisian.    ---         Closed-End Bond Fund Offerings Proliferate                                               OFFERING                                       IPO     PROCEEDS                                      DATE     (In millions)    Templeton Global Income          Mar. 16     $1,100    MFS Intermediate Income          Mar. 10      2,000    New America High Income          Feb. 19        415    Putnam Premier Income Trust      Feb. 18      1,209    Prudential Strategic Income      Feb. 18        558    ACM Govmt.
