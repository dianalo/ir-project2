The law is the first ban in Bolivia on cultivation of the cocaleaf, which is used to produce cocaine.   The measure was approved by the lower house of Congress lastweek and by the Senate on Thursday. President Victor Paz Estenssorosaid he will sign the law when it reaches his desk.   The law limits coca plant cultivation to 29,652 acres and bansproduction on 76,601 acres. Farmers will receive $2,000 for everyhectare of coca plants they destroy, with $365 of that amountprovided by the United States, which has long pressured Bolivia tocrack down on its cocaine trade.   The law also toughens penalties against drug traffickers, cocaleaf producers and public officials who take bribes from drugdealers or who interfere with the prosecution of traffickers.   ``Over the next five years if the government can getinternational backing, cocaine trafficking as it is known inBolivia can be seriously interrupted,'' said Frank Mocolini, headof the DEA office in La Paz.   Bolivia, South America's poorest country, produces an estimatedone-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and European markets.   Last week, thousands of coca leaf farmers attacked a police andU.S. Drug Enforcement Agency camp in the Chapare coca-leafproducing region. Police say at least nine farmers and onepoliceman were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
