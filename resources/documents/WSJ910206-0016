The Treasury Department asked Congress yesterday to throwout a raft of Depression-era laws that have kept banks out ofthe mainstream of financial change. In place of those laws,the Treasury proposed a system to strengthen banks and thenmake them the centerpieces of larger, diversified companiesthat would compete nationwide to offer customers a broadrange of financial services.</LP><TEXT>   Within several years, the bank on the corner may be ownedby, say, an automobile manufacturer. It probably will beoffering consumers complete financial packages involvingeverything from mutual funds to insurance to mortgages.Similarly, it will entice companies with services rangingfrom pension management to investment-banking advice.   &quot;By the year 2000, the real advantage to the customer willbe the option of buying bundled products,&quot; says SamuelBaptista, president of the Financial Services Council, whichrepresents companies that have been pushing for an expansionof banking powers. &quot;Services will be cheaper because of theability of institutions to offer a wider range of productsmore efficiently.&quot;   The far-reaching reform package, which is heavier than theWashington, D.C., telephone book, isn't likely to sailthrough Congress and become law overnight. Any administrationwould find it difficult to sell financial deregulation tolegislators still reeling from the hugely expensive savingsand loan debacle. And, skeptics note, the Bushadministration's Treasury Department has a spotty trackrecord on Capitol Hill.   But the pressures in favor of some sort of overhaul aresurprisingly strong. Hard-lobbying interest groups that inthe past have been at cross purposes and thus stymied changenow are unified behind the idea of expanding bank powers.   What's more, Congress is under pressure to act. It isfeeling the political heat from the credit crunch. It isworried by the shrinking role of U.S. banks in world markets.And it is scared by a run of bank failures that is pushingthe deposit-insurance fund toward insolvency, requiring somesort of congressional response soon.   &quot;With the exception of the Persian Gulf, the biggest issuethis year will be the reformation of the deposit-insurancefund and the whole banking system,&quot; says Sen. Alan Dixon, anIllinois Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. &quot;Everybodyis fairly much on the same track in that we're searching forways to make banks safer and to control risk.&quot;   Already floating around Capitol Hill are several proposalsthat would limit deposit insurance and tighten bankregulation. But the Treasury proposal is the mostcomprehensive so far, and at least parts of it are likely tobe enacted over the next two years. It would:   -- Abolish the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act separation of banksfrom securities firms. Well-capitalized banks would beallowed to affiliate with securities firms, insurancecompanies and mutual funds under a new financial-servicesholding-company structure. The holding companies could beowned by commercial corporations.   -- Allow banks to operate nationwide branch systems,probably leading to rapid consolidation in the entirefinancial-services industry. Within a few years, analystssay, the U.S. banking system might be dominated by a handfulof big companies. Smaller local and regional outfits wouldprobably survive, mainly as niche players offeringspecialized services.   -- Scale back the coverage of federal deposit insurance bylimiting the number of insured accounts that an individualcan hold in one bank, changing bank-failure standards tocurtail coverage of deposits above $100,000, and endingcoverage of all brokered deposits (certificates of depositsold through brokerage firms to raise funds for banks).   -- Tie bank regulation more directly to capital. Toencourage banks to hold more capital -- such as common-stockequity, preferred stock and certain loan-loss reserves -- asa cushion against failure, only highly capitalized bankswould be allowed to become part of financial holdingcompanies. A five-step hierarchy of capital would beestablished, with regulation stiffening as capital declines.Poorly capitalized banks would be required to cut dividendsor sell assets to prevent failure, in a formalization ofsteps that regulators now take on an ad hoc basis.Deposit-insurance premiums would be lower forwell-capitalized banks.   -- Establish a new Federal Banking Agency within theTreasury to regulate all nationally chartered banks andsavings and loans. The Federal Reserve Board would regulatethe 8,500 state-chartered banks, which account for 40% of thenation's banking assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.would lose its regulatory power over state banks andconcentrate on insurance and handling failed institutions.Within a holding company, only the bank or the thrift wouldhave access to federal deposit insurance. Thrifts thatsurvive their industry's current shakeout would look morelike banks and be regulated more like them.   One important issue that the Treasury didn't address indetail is how to recapitalize the shrinking bankdeposit-insurance fund. The FDIC and the banking industry aretrying to work out a plan that will avoid any need for ataxpayer bailout. Yesterday, Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady said he expects agreement on a funding proposal bymonth end. Congress isn't likely to address broader bankingissues until the fund is rebuilt.   To give the financial system and regulators time toadjust, the Treasury is proposing that many of the changes bephased in over several years. Final details of the proposalwon't be clear until the Treasury sends Congress formallegislative proposals, probably at the end of this month.   The Treasury contends that banking laws written more thanhalf a century ago haven't allowed banks to modernize,costing them once-profitable business. &quot;Bank competitors canoffer innovations, such as money-market funds and commercialpaper, that put banks at a competitive disadvantage at homeand abroad,&quot; Secretary Brady said when he released hisproposals yesterday.   As banks have lost large depositors to money-market fundsand valued corporate borrowers to commercial paper (corporateIOUs), they have been forced to concentrate their lending innarrower, and riskier, areas, such as commercial real estate.&quot;A weak banking system hurts the economy, particularly duringdifficult economic times,&quot; Mr. Brady said. &quot;Weak banks areforced to pull back just when their good customers need themmost.&quot;   The Treasury proposal is so broad and complex that almostevery politician, interest group and institution can find init something to praise and something to oppose. &quot;It's goingto be a lobbying nightmare to manage all these components,&quot;says Mr. Baptista of the Financial Services Council.   Although no one predicts that the entire Treasury packagewill be enacted, there is a growing expectation that parts ofit eventually will become law. &quot;It's hard to tell what pieceswill get through,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer, a New YorkDemocrat on the House Banking Committee, who calls theTreasury plan a &quot;catalyst&quot; that will provoke consideration ofa range of banking issues. He likes the administration'sproposal to permit commercial firms to acquire financialholding companies but criticizes as too timid the plan tolimit deposit-insurance coverage.   Large banks, which have long wanted permission to operatenationwide and offer broader services, lost no time inannouncing support. &quot;It's just a giant step forward,&quot; RichardHuber, vice chairman of Continental Bank Corp., said from aphone in his car on his way to Capitol Hill to promote theplan.   Similarly, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s chairman, DennisWeatherstone, who has privately argued for a change in thelaw blocking banks and industrial companies from owning majorstakes in each other, said in a statement that the plan&quot;serves the national interest by making banking and financesounder and more efficient so financial institutions canbetter serve customers in the U.S. and abroad.&quot;   Many small banks are happy with the Treasury plan mainlyfor what it doesn't propose: Immediate enforcement of a flat$100,000 limit on deposit insurance. But much more of whatthey dislike is still in it. They fear that proposed eventuallimits on deposit insurance will scare some large customersinto reducing their balances or moving their money to bigbanks. And they worry that interstate branching will hurtthem by increasing competition.   Consumers, too, may dislike the attempt to limit the scopeof federal deposit insurance. This will almost certainly beone of the controversial parts of the Treasury plan, becauseit touches voters most directly. &quot;Now -- when we face theworst banking crisis since the banking holiday of 1933 --isn't the ideal time to erode depositor confidence byrestricting current coverage amounts,&quot; argues Michelle Meier,counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union. She saysthat coverage limits &quot;would seriously threaten the financialsecurity of elderly consumers who live on the interest incomefrom deposits in excess of $100,000.&quot;   The Treasury proposes that, at first, insurance be limitedto a total of $200,000 per person per institution: $100,000for a retirement account and $100,000 for all other accounts.Later, it would hope to further restrict insurance and applythose limits to the entire financial system, so that a personwould be held to that $200,000 total no matter where hismoney was put.   &quot;Narrowing coverage would reduce exposure of the taxpayerand reintroduce an important level of market discipline bysophisticated depositors,&quot; who would have to pay moreattention to the financial health of their banks, theTreasury argues.   Many small banks and the American Bankers Associationworry that that proposal alone could provoke disruptivewithdrawals. Though only 3.3% of the nation's households holddeposits of more than $100,000 in one institution, thesedeposits account for 24% of the total. The bankers' groupexpressed disappointment that the Treasury didn't do more tolimit demands on the deposit-insurance fund by scaling backthe notion that some banks are simply &quot;too big to fail&quot; --that is, that their big depositors will always be bailed out.   Rep. John Dingell, who heads the House Energy and CommerceCommittee, took aim at another controversial part of theplan, the proposal to let banks affiliate with securitiesfirms and to let commercial firms purchase financial-servicesholding companies. &quot;Wall Street is a dry hole today; even inthe best of times, it is an extremely risky business,&quot; theMichigan Democrat said. &quot;Allowing weak banks into thesecurities field or into insurance, which has solvencyproblems, will simply compound the problems of both.&quot;   Indeed, companies like American Express, Sears and Fordthat have set out to build integrated financial servicenetworks haven't found it easy to achieve the synergies andprofits they had anticipated. But some analysts believe thatcurrent laws have prevented the type of fully stockedfinancial supermarket that the marriage of banks and brokerscould provide.   Despite his skepticism, Rep. Dingell said that &quot;somemodification of Glass-Steagall&quot; may be in order as long asdepositors and taxpayers are protected from shoulderinglosses incurred by non-bank affiliates. The views of Mr.Dingell are important because his committee controlslegislation covering the securities business. The 1933Glass-Steagall, which was passed while Mr. Dingell's fatherwas a member of Congress, was enacted to prevent unfair andmanipulative market practices that the combination ofcommercial and investment banks spawned.   Mr. Dingell was even harsher about the proposal to letcommercial firms acquire banks. Such combinations were barredby the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act to prevent theconcentration of financial power. &quot;To say that Ford andGeneral Motors can own U.S. banks is to say that Honda canown U.S. banks,&quot; Mr. Dingell said. &quot;These administrationproposals are bad medicine for banks and poison for theAmerican people.&quot; Nevertheless, he said he was ready to workwith the administration to revise the proposals.   His fellow Michigan Democrat, Sen. Donald Riegle, chairmanof the Senate Banking Committee, said he believes depositinsurance should be reformed before Congress considersgranting banks additional powers.   But under pressure from aggressive banks and theirlawyers, there's already a slow, uneven drift towardnationwide banking and expanded powers that will onlyaccelerate. &quot;Through regulation and possibly throughlegislation, there will be new powers granted to holdingcompanies,&quot; predicts Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican onthe House Banking Committee.   There will be other controversies. Rep. Henry Gonzalez,the Texas Democrat who chairs the House Banking Committee,praised the Treasury for proposing early intervention tocorrect deficiencies at problem banks, but he called theregulatory-agency proposals &quot;a timid step toward thelong-delayed consolidation and streamlining of themulti-headed federal regulatory structure.&quot; Timid or not, theproposal to combine four regulators into two is alreadyprompting talk of fierce bureaucratic turf fights,particularly if the Federal Reserve decides it doesn't haveenough power over major banks.   Also, small bankers are likely to use their extensivepolitical clout in the House to fight rapid expansion of bigbanks. &quot;Over time these changes could lead to massiveconsolidation of economic and financial power into the handsof a few giants,&quot; fears Philip Vallandingham, president ofthe First State Bank of Barboursville, W.Va., and the head ofthe Independent Bankers Association.   Timothy Ryan, chairman of the Office of ThriftSupervision, expects &quot;some very interesting consolidation&quot; inbanking as several large holding companies scramble to createnationwide financial-services networks. But he says small andregional banks that know and serve customers well will alwayshave a role. &quot;Niche service will be the wave of the future,&quot;he predicts.   Secretary Brady believes that as bankers and Congressdebate the issues, they will see the savings that an overhaulcould bring. Interstate branching alone could lead toefficiencies that would save as much as $10 billion a yearwithin five years of the change, he says, calling that a&quot;mind-boggling&quot; figure in the face of the bank industry's1990 after-tax profits of $20 billion.   ---   Staff reporter Paulette Thomas contributed to thisarticle.   ---            The Treasury's Banking Recommendations                                                                                                        CAPITAL                                                                                                        Well-capitalized institutions would be subject to lessregulation, while activities of undercapitalized institutionswould be subject to stringent restrictions.
