Roettger said the threatening letters thatTaylor wrote her were too ambiguous to warrant a conviction that could havesent him to jail for 30 years.;    Taylor celebrated his acquittal byproclaiming his fixation finished.;    &quot;I don't even find her attractiveanymore,&quot; said Taylor, 39, now graying and paunchy. &quot;It was just chronicgrief, and it's over. The spell is broken.&quot;;    The object of his obsessionwas Kathleen Goldstein, his high school sweetheart from 1969. She's now amarried elementary school principal who grew so tired of his pleas and lettersthat she made a federal case of it.;    Starting with the couple's breakup in1970, Taylor wrote Goldstein hundreds and hundreds of love letters, gushing abottomless desire to have her back.;    No matter where Goldstein moved,Taylor tracked her down, though he never approached her in person.;    Lastyear, Taylor's letters took on an ominous tone, predicting the premature deathof Goldstein's husband, David. The FBI arrested Taylor in November and chargedhim with sending threats through the mail.;    In his nine-page order,Roettger said the letters didn't back up the conviction.;    Roettger said hesympathized with Goldstein but said a civil injunction would be a moreappropriate way to keep Taylor at bay.;    &quot;The evidence presents atragicomedy from a theater of the absurd,&quot; the judge wrote.;    Goldstein, whotestified that she feared for her life, could not be reached for comment afterthe judge's decision was released.;    In addition to writing the letters,Taylor traveled to Florida in search of Goldstein every other year since the1970 breakup.;    &quot;I tried to see her a thousand times,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;Iremember lying on Fort Lauderdale beach, crying.&quot;;    Taylor reflected on hisobsession Thursday as though it were an addiction he had kicked.;    &quot;Thiscould have been over years ago if I had just taken a look at her,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910308  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  372  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 8, 199100068187,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
