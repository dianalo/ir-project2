The&quot;National Reconstruction Project&quot; is the first set oflong-range goals proposed by Mr. Collor, who took office inMarch 1990.   The proposals, which must be approved by Congress, wouldin some cases require changing the 1988 constitution. Backersof Mr. Collor, said the plan proves he is willing tonegotiate. He has been accused of authoritarianism. Criticssaid he merely hopes to stall a growing opposition, therebybuying more time for his as yet unsuccessful bid to cutfour-digit inflation.   Mr. Collor predicted yearly growth of 4% to 5% forBrazil's economy. Last year, the gross national productslumped 4.6%. Other goals include a bigger role for theprivate sector in areas traditionally controlled bygovernment, such as telecommunications and transportation.                                                                                                          SPAIN MAY CUT KEY RATE                                                                                                          Spain's central bank is expected, possibly as early astoday, to cut its benchmark intervention rate as much as onepoint and scrap a 30% deposit requirement for companies'foreign borrowings. This would come on the heels of a declineof 0.1% in Spain's consumer price index in February. The dropbrought the annualized inflation rate to 5.9%, consolidatinga downward trend that was interrupted in January by a 1.2%jump in consumer prices. Interest on one-year governmenttreasury bills dropped 0.76 point to 13.23%, the thirdreduction in these rates this year. Some analysts expect thedrop in inflation to pave the way for an immediate drop inthe Bank of Spain's money-market intervention rate, now14.5%. Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga has said Spanishinterest rates, which are among the highest in Europe, willcome down when inflationary pressures are brought undercontrol, but not before.                                                                                                          GM MAY BUILD OPELS IN POLAND                                                                                                          Warsaw said General Motors Corp. is near agreeing toproduce its Opel cars in Poland. The Detroit-based automaker's officials acknowledged the talks but said only thatPoland &quot;is in our strategic plans.&quot; Poland said GM was &quot;themost serious&quot; in a search for cooperation with the FSO carfactory.                                                                                                          BELGIUM TO EASE SIGN CONFUSION                                                                                                          Belgium plans to help ease drivers' confusion byinstalling road signs in Flemish, French and German, startingApril 1. Heading west out of Belgium for Lille, France,motorists will spot signs to Rijsel, the city's name inFlemish. They can expect to see signs for Aachen andAix-LaChapelle if that German city is their destination. Onhighways to France's capital, signs will indicate both Parisand Parijs.

ASEAN WEIGHS SOVIET REQUEST                                                                                                          The Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Malaysia,Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei and Thailand --is considering the Soviet Union's request to be a &quot;dialoguepartner,&quot; joining the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, NewZealand, the European Community and South Korea.                                                                                                          BANKRUPTCIES IN JAPAN SOAR                                                                                                          Corporate bankruptcies in Japan jumped 51% in February to676 from 447 a year earlier, as effects of higher interestrates and a stock-market crash continued to ripple throughthe economy.   Their debt volume soared more than fourfold to 329.16billion yen ($2.43 billion), Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., acredit-research concern, said. But analysts said theaccelerating pace and scale weren't sharp enough to justifypredictions bankruptcy debts this year could reach sixtrillion yen.   Still, February was the fifth consecutive month in whichbankruptcies rose from year-earlier levels. Until lastOctober, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange reached a low of 40%from its level at the start of 1990, the number ofbankruptcies had fallen for 69 consecutive months.   That market plunge was set off by rising interest rates,which also began to undermine Japan's buoyant propertymarket. In February, real estate companies' failures tripledto 69 and accounted for nearly half of all bankruptcy debts.

Germany's highest court said a married woman can't beforced to adopt her husband's surname.
