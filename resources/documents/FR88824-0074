ALK requestspermission to extract certain data from the 1987 ICC Master Waybill Sampleto distribute as part of a book entitled ``Railroad Traffic in the UnitedStates_1987.'' The remainder of the book will consist of extracts fromthe 1987 ICC Public Use Waybill File (PUWF). The book will be availableto the general public. It will be similar in content to the 1984, 1985,and 1986 volumes of the same title. The 1984 and 1985 were derived solelyfrom the Public Use Waybill Files of those years. The change in formatof the PUWF requires ICC permission to produce equivalent information for1987.The information requested is:1. Originating and terminating net tonnage by State, for each of the 20AAR ``CS-54'' commodity groups.2. Net tonnage by State-to-State pairs, for each of the 20 ``CS-54'' commoditygroups, including interchange States.3. Carloads by State-to-State pairs, for the following 12 broad cartypegroupings: (1) Plain Box Cars, (2) Equipped Box Cars, (3) Insulated BoxCars, (4) Refrigerated Cars, (5) Open-Top Hoppers, (6) Covered Hoppers,(7) Gondolas, (8) Plain Flat Cars, (9) Auto Racks, (10) Intermodel Flats,(11) Tanks Cars, (12) Other Car Types.4. Number of trailers or containers by State-to-State pairs, for all intermodalTOFC/COFC traffic as a whole.The information is requested in four separate files, and in summary formonly to prevent cross-referencing between the files, or between this dataand the Public Use Waybill File.The Commission requires rail carriers to file waybill sample informationif in any of the past three years they terminated on their lines at least:(1) 4,500 revenue carloads or (2) 5 percent of revenue carloads in anyone State (49 C.F.R. Part 1244). From the waybill information, the Commissionhas developed a Public Use Waybill File that has satisfied the majorityof all our waybill data requests while protecting the confidentiality ofproprietary data submitted by the railroads. However, if confidential waybilldata are requested, as in this case, we will consider releasing the dataonly after certain protective conditions are met and public notice is given.More specifically, under the Commission's current policy for handling waybillrequests, we will not release any confidential waybill data until after:(1) public notice is provided so affected parties have an opportunity toobject and (2) certain requirements designed to protect the data's confidentialityare agreed to by the requesting party [Ex Parte No. 385 (Sub-No. 2), 52FR 12415, April 16, 1987].Accordingly, if any parties object to this request, they should file theirobjections (an original and 2 copies) with the Director of the Commission'sOffice of Transportation Analysis (OTA) within 14 calendar days of thedate of this notice. They should also include all grounds for objectionsto the full or partial disclosure of the requested data. The Director ofOTA will consider these objections in determining whether to release therequested waybill data. Any parties who objected will be timely notifiedof the Director's decision.<ITAG tagnum="21">Contact:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James A.
