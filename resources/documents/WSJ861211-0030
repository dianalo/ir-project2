Some of the early gains eroded later in the session, however, after the rumors were denied by the Iranian news agency IRNA.    The rumors started when IRNA described Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri as the &quot;successor&quot; to Mr. Khomeini and called him &quot;spiritual leader of the Islamic Revolution,&quot; implying that Mr. Khomeini might be dead. But IRNA later issued a correction, saying that it had meant to say &quot;future successor.&quot;    Although some traders said they bought gold contracts because of the uncertainty that would have been created by Mr. Khomeini's death, others were skeptical. &quot;I still don't know why that would be bullish,&quot; said Gail Levey, vice president, futures, at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. Added Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, &quot;It was a convenient excuse -- I never considered him a stabilizing factor anyway.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for December delivery rose to a session high of $393 an ounce, but closed at $389.80, up $2.80 for the day. The more active February contract rose $2.70 to $393.10. December silver contracts rose five cents to $5.374 an ounce. Meanwhile, platinum contracts for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $6.20 an ounce to $482.30.    The platinum price increase was prompted partly by aggressive Swiss bullion buying, Ms. Levey said. Some chart-conscious traders added that technical factors accelerated the gains.    In addition, reports of an explosion at a Rustenberg Platinum Mines smelting unit in South Africa helped bolster platinum prices, some brokers said. Analysts estimated, however, that only about 10%, or less than 40,000 ounces of the mine's smelting capacity, would be affected over a four-month period.    Some traders said that the report, which first surfaced Tuesday, had already been absorbed by the market. &quot;It filtered out into the hinterlands&quot; yesterday, said Dennis Suskind, partner in charge of metals at J. Aron andamp; Co., New York.    The metals markets continue to trade in a narrow price range, with most of the action stemming from floor traders, or those trading for their own account. &quot;There are nibbles of trade participation, but I don't see it continuing,&quot; one trader said.    &quot;Volume is light, liquidity is thin,&quot; said Nancy Nohavec, chief gold trader for Shearson in New York, adding, &quot;We're in a holiday market mode now.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices closed sharply higher on the heels of a rally in bond futures, program trading and technical factors. Traders said bond futures rallied on speculation that the U.S. and West Germany may shortly reach an accord on monetary policy. Stock-index futures also rallied, triggering a wave of short covering by local exchange traders who were forced to buy contracts to offset those sold earlier. Reports that oil producing countries may not be able to agree to output quotas also fueled the rallies, traders said. As the value of the December Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index future widened to about 120 basis points over the underlying cash index, arbitrage traders sold the futures and bought the underlying stocks, adding to the rally in the stock market. Arbitrage trading depressed futures prices momentarily, but renewed buying maintained the rally. &quot;There's a lot of money out there to be committed to buy programs&quot; in futures, said James Emerson, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly prices were up and hog prices were mostly higher because of frigid temperatures throughout much of the Midwest. Analysts said the cold should limit movement of hogs, giving strength to the market. Cattle prices were slightly lower as the market reacted to a lack of strength in the wholesale beef market, analysts said. Analysts said a seven state cattle-on-feed report that the Agriculture Department is scheduled to release Monday will have little impact on the market. They estimate that as of Dec. 1, the number of cattle on feedlots should be current with figures from the year-earlier period. Estimates for marketings range between a 1% decline to a 1% increase, and placement predictions range between being unchanged to up 5%.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices are expected to open lower today after the Agriculture Department slashed its estimate of U.S. corn exports for the year ending Aug. 30, 1987. In a report released yesterday afternoon, the department dropped its export forecast 13% to 1.1 billion bushels, reflecting sharply lower imports by the Soviet Union. The new estimate puts this year's corn exports 9% below last year's figure; previously the department expected corn exports to rise. The department also lowered its wheat export estimate 5% to 975 million bushels for the year ending May 31, 1987. Wheat and corn futures closed mixed but little changed in extremely light trading. Soybean futures rose slightly.    COTTON: Futures prices rose more than one cent a pound on expectations the Agriculture Department would reduce its estimate of the current crop. Also, continued inclement weather in Texas cotton-growing areas spurred price gains. After the close of trading, the department released its estimate of the cotton crop for the season that began Aug. 1. It projected output of 9.7 million bales of 500 pounds each, down from an estimate of almost 9.9 million bales in its Nov. 1 report and well below the 13.4 million bales actually produced last season. The reduced estimate fell within the range of analysts' expectations. A drought earlier in the year in the Mississippi Delta and continued wet weather in Texas account for the lower monthly crop estimates, analysts said. But John McNutt, managing analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said, &quot;No one is yet prepared to report severe numbers because historically Texas cotton crops have weathered extreme cold and snows and survived very well.&quot; He added that the extremely wet weather in Texas has slowed the crop and caused its quality to deteriorate somewhat. James Roemer, meteorlogist for Weather Trades Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, said a few inches of snow had fallen in the Lubbock-Midland area and that if it continues for the next day or two there could be damage to the crop. Normally at this time of the year, about 70% of the Texas crop is harvested, but only about 55% has been gathered so far, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
