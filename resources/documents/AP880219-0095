Mario Biaggi faces a fate that hasbefallen only one congressman in the past 126 years: expulsion fromthe U.S. House of Representatives.   That expulsion came eight years ago, when Rep. Michael ``Ozzie''Myers, a Pennsylvania Democrat, was expelled from Congress on Oct.2, 1980, five weeks after his conviction in the Abscam briberyscandal.   Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., who was also convicted inAbscam, resigned his seat on March 11, 1982, shortly before theSenate was about to make him the first senator expelled since theCivil War.   In 1861 and 1862, fourteen senators and three members of theHouse from the South were expelled for siding with the Confederacyin the war between the states.   The first expulsion took place in 1797, when William Blount, oneof Tennessee's first two senators, was turned out of office.President James Madison had accused Blount of conspiring with theBritish and the Creek and Cherokee Indians to conquer West Florida,then under the control of Spain.   From Blount to Myers, only 19 men _ four representatives, 15senators _ have been expelled in the entire 200-year history of theSenate and the House of Representatives.   In 1967, the House voted to exclude Rep. Adam Clayton Powell,D-N.Y., but he won a court suit prohibiting Congress from denyinghim a seat.   The list of congressman indicted and convicted in office runsmuch longer. Some resigned their seats; others lost re-electionbids.   Then-Rep. Thomas J. Lane, D-Mass., spent four months in jail in1956 for evading $38,542 in income taxes, but was re-elected thatfall.   Myers was one of six House members convicted and sent to prisonin the Abscam scandal. Myers and four others _ Reps. John Jenrette,D-S.C., John Muphy, D-N.Y., Frank Thompson, D-N.J., and RichardKelly, R-Fla. _ lost re-election bids a few months after theirindictments in 1980.   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa., won re-election in 1980 while underindictment in that scandal, but was convicted two months later andresigned his seat before going to prison.   Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, was indicted in April 1983 andconvicted in 1984 of violating the 1978 Ethics in Government Act byfailing to report $333,978 in loans and other transactions on hisfinancial disclosure forms. The House voted to reprimand him inJuly 1984. Hansen was freed in October 1987 after serving nearlyone year in prison.   Last Dec. 18, the House voted 324-68 to reprimand Rep. AustinMurphy, D-Pa., for hiring a no-show employee, misusingcongressional resources and twice having someone else cast votesfor him.   The House ethics committee also decided last December thatformer Rep. William H. Boner, D-Tenn., violated House rules byusing his campaign to obtain personal ownership rights ofequipment, a building, a car and other items worth more than$200,000. But the committee said it ``lost jurisdiction'' whenBoner resigned last October to become mayor of Nashville.   The Justice Department last March dropped a grand jury probe ofBoner's finances.   The House ethics committee unanimously cleared Rep. Fernand J.St Germain, D-R.I., last April of allegations of financialwrong-doing, and Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, advoideddisciplinary action after she reimbursed the Treasury $45,000 paidto an aide who had moved from Washington to New York.   The ethics panel is investigating allegations that Rep. CharlesRose, D-N.C., converted more than $63,000 in campaign money topersonal use, and that Fofo I.F. Sunia, American Samoa's non-votingdelegate, had ``ghost'' employees on his House payroll.   Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., was indicted last April on chargesof bank, mail and tax fraud. No trial date has been set.   Then-Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, D-La., was indicted in July1979 on charges of buying votes in the 1978 elections and violatingfederal campain finance laws. He was acquitted of some vote-buyingcounts and the others were dropped, and a federal appeals courtdismissed the charges of campaign finance law violations.   Then-Rep. Joshua Eilberg, D-Pa., was indicted in October 1978 onfederal charges of illegally receiving compensation to help aPhiladelphia hospital get a $14.5 million federal grant. He pleadedguilty in February 1979 and was sentenced to five years' probationand fined $10,000.   Then-Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., was indicted in the fall of1978 on 13 counts of bribery, conspiracy and perjury. After amistrial, he resigned from the House in January 1980 for healthreasons after the House ethics committee had accused him of 25rules violations. In February 1980, he pleaded guilty to conspiracyin a plea-bargaining arrangement and was given a year's probation.   Then-Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., was indicted in March1978 and convicted in October 1978 on 29 felony counts of illegallydiverting employees' salaries to his personal use. Censured by theHouse in 1979, Diggs resigned from Congress in 1980 and servedseven months of a three-year prison sentence.   About two dozen members of the House have been censured formisconduct, including two for sexual misconduct in 1983: Daniel B.Crane, R-Ill., and Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass.   Then-Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., was censured in 1967 for payingpersonal bills with campaign funds. His son, Christopher, is now asenator.</TEXT></DOC>
