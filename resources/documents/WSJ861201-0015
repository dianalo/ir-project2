Generally, taxpayers will want to accelerate deductions into this year and defer as much income as possible to 1987. That has long been sound strategy.    &quot;People are searching, saying, 'Gee, there must be something I should do by Dec. 31 or I'll forever regret it,' but they shouldn't do anything foolish just because of tax reform,&quot; says Larry Biehl of Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, San Mateo, Calif., financial planners. &quot;The advice is virtually the same. It's just that this year, it will produce an even greater material benefit since most people will be paying less taxes next year in lower brackets.&quot;    Sidney Kess, a tax partner at accountants KMG Main Hurdman in New York, recommends not looking beyond 1987, the so-called transition year, when the top tax rate will be 38.5%, before dropping to 28% for most people in 1988. &quot;There are going to be more changes,&quot; Mr. Kess says, echoing many tax experts' belief that 28% on all income is targeted too low but that Congress won't make any further increases in capital gains taxes.    Starting Jan. 1, the maximum tax rate on assets held longer than six months jumps to 28% from 20% currently. Although that is prompting many stock and bond investors to take their gains now, tax advisers warn that selling without taking other tax changes into consideration could be a mistake.    &quot;The new law is so complicated that the only thing to do is to do a dummy tax return for yourself for 1986 and try to do one for 1987, then make decisions,&quot; says Matthew Kessler, a tax partner at the Chicago-based accounting firm of Grant Thornton.    Generally, however, getting out of investments -- or selling and quickly rebuying -- to save taxes isn't advised. Says Mr. Biehl: &quot;Do it if you were going to sell anyway. If inflation stays this low, we could get a 20% rise in the stock market that would more than make up for the extra taxes.&quot;    Tax changes create a special hazard for many 50%-bracket investors who take gains, rush into tax shelters or make other year-end moves now: They could end up paying more alternative minimum taxes than would be due in regular taxes in 1986 or 1987. &quot;More people will have to compute their tax liability under both systems,&quot; says Mr. Kess.    Investors who are already in tax shelters producing multiple write-offs have to worry most about the minimum tax. Contrary to most regular taxpayers, who should take advantage of deductions that are disappearing, such as sales taxes, these investors might want to postpone major purchases. They would benefit, however, from making charitable contributions this year, particularly by making gifts of appreciated securities instead of cash. After 1986, such gifts could trigger the alternative minimum tax.    On the other hand, anyone who may pay the minimum tax in 1986 should try to put as much ordinary income into this year as possible. The reason: They will pay a flat 20% on minimum-taxable income this year, but 21% next year.    This will be the last year that shelter investors will be able to fully use losses from such investments to offset income such as salary. Starting next year, shelter investors will gradually lose this benefit until it disappears in 1991. From that point, passive losses -- coming from rentals or from business activities in which the investor isn't regularly involved in management -- can be used only to offset passive income from similar investments.    Mr. Kess suggests that shelter investors who are also nonactive shareholders in closely held family businesses might benefit by converting them to Subchapter S corporations. &quot;A shareholder who doesn't materially participate in an S corporation might be able to use that passive income to offset passive losses from shelters,&quot; he says.    Owners of other closely held businesses that have appreciated assets should consider liquidating those companies before the end of 1986 and possibly operating as a sole proprietor instead. Says Mr. Kess, &quot;If you liquidate the business and pull out this year, you only pay personal capital gains taxes of 20%. Next year, you'd pay the 34% tax at the corporate level, with the balance taxed as ordinary income at the individual rate.&quot;    Because 1986 is the last year that many people will be able to deduct contributions to an individual retirement account or put as much into tax-deferred 401(k) plans, salting away the maximum allowed should be a priority, advisers say.    People who are retiring this year have special tax considerations. Anyone who takes a lump-sum distribution from a retirement plan can still roll it over tax-free into an IRA, but taxpayers who don't do that face a choice. They may either take the money before the end of 1986 and use 10-year forward averaging or wait and use five-year averaging at the new, lower rates. &quot;Most people will probably save more taxes by taking it this year, even at a higher rate,&quot; says George Weinstein, tax partner and director of personal financial planning at Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells in Miami.    Advisers also put emphasis on eliminating consumer debt, since interest deductions for charge-card purchases and the like will be phased out starting next year. Although banks are encouraging homeowners to convert consumer interest to mortgage interest because home-borrowing expenses will remain fully deductible, the loans aren't fail-safe. For loans completed after Aug. 15 of this year, the deduction is limited to interest on a loan up to the original purchase price of the home plus improvements.    &quot;We now have five different kinds of interest under the new tax law with five different sets of rules,&quot; notes Mr. Weinstein. &quot;What it suggests is that you have to be very careful if you have to incur debt, but especially consumer interest&quot; and interest on loans for investment.    Mr. Biehl cautions against knee-jerk reactions to other drawbacks of tax overhaul, such as the sharp new limits on income that can be shifted to children.    Previously, earnings on assets placed in a Clifford Trust or similar type of vehicle were taxed at the child's rate, not the parents'. Under the new law, parents will pay the income taxes until a child is age 14, but a trust could still save considerable taxes in the long run by keeping the assets out of a parent's estate.    &quot;Any appreciation on assets in the trust go immediately to the kids with no tax. Since the maximum rate on estate taxes is 50%, the benefit could far outweigh the negative income tax ramifications,&quot; Mr. Biehl says.    ---   Ms. Bettner, based in Los Angeles, writes frequently on personal finance for The Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
