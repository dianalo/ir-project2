It was his first response to the suggestion last week bySecretary of State James A. Baker III in connection with theEgyptian proposal for a meeting in Cairo between Israel and aPalestinian delegation.   In Baghdad, Iraq, PLO sources said chairman Yasser Arafat wouldbe under pressure from other Palestinian leaders at a meeting nextweek to take a tough line on Palestinian-Israeli talks.   Shamir said in a speech in the Raanana suburb of Tel Aviv thatIsrael wants to meet with Palestinians to discuss procedures forelections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a key elementof an Israeli peace plan set forth in April.   He added, however: ``We don't need to involve ... ministers,foreign ministers or heads of state. It should be a technicaldiscussion. This has been turned into, inflated into somethingpolitically big, into some big event.''   His remarks were broadcast on Israel radio.   Shamir, who leads the right-wing Likud bloc, repeated Israel'srefusal to involve the Palestine Liberation Organization, a seriousobstacle to starting negotiations. Israel defines the PLO as aterrorist group.   Israeli media, quoting sources in Washington, said Americanleaders were growing impatient with Israel's failure to respond tothe latest peace proposals.   The daily Haaretz said State Department officials sent ``sharpmessages,'' citing the latest pronouncements of hardliners inShamir's party who oppose meeting with Palestinians in Cairo.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told Israeli reporters Thursday,however, that he ``does not have the impression Baker has run outof patience,'' Israel radio reported.   Egypt proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting as a way ofbridging differences between Israel and the PLO over Israel's planfor elections to choose Palestinians to negotiate with the Israelis.   The PLO objected that the Israeli plan did not guaranteePalestinians an independent state after a proposed five-year periodof Palestinian self-rule in the territories, which Israel hasoccupied since the 1967 war.   Israel's Cabinet leadership rejected Egypt's proposals Oct. 6 ona tie vote of six Likud members and six from the Labor Party, whichis the other partner in the coalition government and supports theEgyptian approach.   Baker subsequently telephoned Arens and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, theEgyptian foreign minister, and proposed they meet in Washington tofind a compromise way of choosing a Palestinian delegation.   The sources in the Iraqi capital said the Palestinian CentralCouncil, to begin meeting on Sunday, will put pressure on Arafat toreject any attempt to exclude the PLO from peace talks with Israel.   A senior council member told The Associated Press privately thatradical factions called the meeting to stop Arafat from acceptingEgyptian and U.S. efforts toward a Middle East peace effort thatmight not include the PLO.   ``We haven't endorsed the so-called Mubarak plan and we willnever accept a plan short of full PLO participation in any peaceprocess,'' he said.   The Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine andThe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the largest PLOfactions after Arafat's own Fatah, have denounced the Egyptianproposals.</TEXT></DOC>
