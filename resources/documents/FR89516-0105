Background </ITAG>The SROs have worked together over the past twelve years to develop uniformarbitration rules through the auspices of the Securities Industry Conferenceon Arbitration (``SICA''). SICA was formed by the securities industry in1977 at the Commission's invitation to review then existing arbitrationprocedures as an alternative to the implementation of the Commission'sown proposals to establish a system for the resolution of disputes betweenbroker-dealers and their customers.\6\<NOTE/> SICA is comprised of a representative from each SRO thatadministers an arbitration program,\7\<NOTE/> a representative of the securities industry, and four representativesof the public. In the years between the initial development of the UniformCode of Arbitration (``Uniform Code'') and September 1987, SICA met periodicallyto discuss issues that arose in the administration of the code, and todevelop any necessary amendments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\The resulting Uniform Code of Arbitration is also usedfor the resolution of intra-industry disputes, (<T3>e.g., </T3>disputes between members of an SRO or between a member ofan SRO and an associated person of a member, such as a registered representative.)Unless otherwise limited by the terms of the rules, the amendments includedin this filing also pertain to intra-industry disputes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\The SROs that administer an arbitration program are theNYSE, NASD, AMEX, MSRB, PSE, MSE, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago BoardOptions Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange.On September 10, 1987, after a review of securities industry-sponsoredarbitration, the Commission sent to SICA a letter that set out its viewsregarding the need for changes to the Uniform Code.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission also sent letters to the SROs on July 8, 1988requesting that the SROs review the issues raised by the current use ofmandatory predispute arbitration agreements by their member firms.\9\<NOTE/> Since September 1987, SICA and its subcommittees have metregularly to develop proposals in response to the Commission's letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\<T3>See </T3>letter frm Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, to James E. Buck, Senior Vice President, NYSE, dated September10, 1987 (``September 10, 1987 letter''). This letter was also addressedseparately to each of the other members of SICA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\<T3>See </T3>letter from David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, to John J. Phelan,Jr., Chairman, NYSE dated July 8, 1988 (``July 8, 1988 letter''). Thisletter was also addressed to the senior executive officers of all otherSROs that administer arbitration facilities.  The SROs have filed nearly identical rule proposals. For convenience, thediscussion in the text of the proposals sometimes refers only to NYSE rulenumbers. The corresponding rules of the NASD and AMEX are referenced inthe footnotes, which also identify differences among the SROs' rules. The majority of the proposals to amend the SROs' rules were based on changesin the Uniform Code made by SICA largely in response to the September 1987and July 1988 Commission letters.\1\\0\<NOTE/> The other proposals included in this order were developedto meet concerns that have arisen through the administration of the arbitrationprograms. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\The SRO rules developed in response to the Commission'sletters are NYSE Rules 607, 608, 610, 619, 623, 627, 629(b) and 637; AMEXRules 602, 603, 607, 614, 618, 620(b) and 427; and NASD Sections 19, 21,23, 32, 37, 41 and 43(b) of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure andSection 21 of Article III of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Description of the Proposals, Summary of Comments and Analysis</ITAG>A. Service of Pleadings The SROs have proposed to modify the procedures for service of pleadings.Currently, the arbitration departments of the SROs serve all pleadingson the parties. As cases have increased, using the arbitration departmentas an intermediary for the service of pleadings has added unnecessarilyto delays in processing cases and to the cost of operating the arbitrationsystem. The SROs propose to serve only the initial pleading in a case,the ``claim,'' and to require that parties serve all subsequent pleadingsdirectly upon one another. This approach is intended to save administrativetime and costs while continuing to ensure that respondents receive adequatenotice of the institution of arbitration proceedings. Under the proposal, parties also will be required to supply the departmentof arbitration with sufficient copies of the pleadings for the arbitrationdepartment staff and each of the arbitrators. The proposal specifies thatservice by first-class postage prepaid or by overnight mail service isconsidered to be made on the date of mailing and service by other meansis considered to be made on the date of delivery. This proposed rule change would apply both to arbitration proceedings conductedpursuant to the simplified procedures for small claims under NYSE Rule601 and regular cases initiated pursuant to NYSE Rule 612.\11\<NOTE/> No commenters specifically addressed this proposal. The Commissionbelieves that this proposed rule change should improve the efficiency andspeed of arbitration proceedings administered by the SROs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ AMEX Rules 606 and 621, and NASD Sections 13 and 25.In addition, the proposed rule change to the NASD's Section 25 providesthat where both an NASD member firm and a person associated with the memberfirm are named parties to an arbitration proceeding, service on the associatedperson may be made either on the associated person, or on the member firm,which would then have the obligation to perfect service on the associatedperson. Proposed Section 25 also provides that if the firm does not undertaketo represent the associated person, the member firm must serve the associatedperson, advise all parties and the director of arbitration that the firmis not representing the associated person, and must provide the associatedperson's current address. The NYSE and AMEX did not propose such a requirement.B. Classification of Arbitrators The arbitration panels at the SROs for cases involving public customershave historically been composed of a majority of ``public arbitrators''and a minority of ``industry arbitrators''. All arbitrators, both publicand industry, are required to be neutral, and may have no affiliation orbias towards either party.\12\<NOTE/> There have not been, however, clear requirements or specificationsfor who may serve as a public arbitrator. The SROs' proposals would specifywho may not serve as a public arbitrator and who may serve as an industryarbitrator. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\This is different from tripartite arbitration where eachparty designates an arbitrator and the designated arbitrators then agreeupon a third arbitrator, <T3>Cf., </T3>Elkouri, Frank et al., <T3>How Arbitration Works, </T3>4th ed. (1985), BNA, at page 136; and <T3>Domke Comm. Arb. </T3>andSection;27.01 (Rev. ed., Wilner) 1985-1988 Callahanandamp; Co.   In its September 10, 1987 letter, the Commission endorsed the continueduse of mixed public/industry panels. The Commission also stated, however,that ``[t]he absence of clear guidelines for qualifying public arbitrators* * * and the inclusion in the pool of public arbitrators of persons withclear affiliations with the securities industry is a source of great concern.''The Commission recommended that ``arbitration panels include persons whoare not so connected with the industry that it may hinder their abilityto make independent judgments with respect to specific industry practices.''The letter set out specific examples of types of persons who the Commissionpreliminarily believed should not serve as public arbitrators. In responseto the SEC's request, SICA revised its definition of public and industryarbitrators. The proposals address the potential for real or apparent biason the part of public arbitrators who may have some professional or personalassociation with the securities industry.The Uniform Code defines as an industry arbitrator one who is associatedwith a member of an SRO, broker, dealer, government securities broker,government securities dealer, municipal securities dealer, or registeredinvestment adviser. The SICA rule permits an individual who had been associatedwith one of these to become a public arbitrator after three years, if theindividual has gone on to other work and is not retired from the securitiesindustry. All industry retirees will no longer be permitted to serve aspublic arbitrators, but may continue to serve as industry arbitrators.The rule also deals with the appropriate role in the arbitration systemof professionals such as attorneys or accountants who provide servicesto securities industry clients. The rule would classify as industry arbitrators,rather than public arbitrators, attorneys, accountants and other professionalswho devoted twenty percent or more of their professional work effort tosecurities industry clients within the last two years. In addition, therule excludes from service as a public or industry arbitrator persons whoare spouses or other members of the household of a person associated witha registered broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securitiesdealer or investment adviser. NYSE Rule 607 defines industry and public arbitrators differently in tworespects from the rule developed by SICA and adopted by the other SROs.The NYSE has extended from three years to five years the time period duringwhich one who had been employed in the securities industry may not serveas a public arbitrator. In addition, the NYSE has proposed to exclude anyonefrom its public arbitrator rolls who had spent a substantial part of hisor her business career in the securities industry, notwithstanding thepassage of five years. Accordingly, under the NYSE proposal, an individualwho had worked in the securities industry for a substantial period of timeand then left the profession for some other work would not, after fiveyears, be assigned to its public arbitrator roster.\1\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ The NYSE has also included in its filing guidelinesfor the classification of arbitrators to complement its classificationrule. In the guidelines, the NYSE states that while it will continue toclassify as public arbitrators lawyers and other professionals whose partnersrepresent the securities industry, it will recognize challenges for causeagainst them. The AMEX rule for the classification of arbitrators is Rule 602, and theNASD rule is Section 19. The AMEX and NASD rules do not include the twochanges from the Uniform Code that have been proposed by the NYSE. Further,while the NYSE and AMEX have included persons associated with investmentadvisers within their industry arbitrator pools consistent with the UniformCode, the NASD has concluded that investment advisers not associated withbroker-dealers are more akin to investors and should be placed in the publicarbitrator pool. The SROs also proposed disclosure provisions designed to assist partiesin assuring that the panel assigned to each case is appropriately balanced.Specifically, under the proposed SRO rules, the employment histories ofthe arbitrators for the past ten years as well as the information providedby arbitrators pursuant to a separate disclosure rule \1\\4\<NOTE/> will be disclosed.\1\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The disclosure rule is a proposed rule change discussedin Section C of this order. The rule would require arbitrators to makeextensive disclosures to the parties. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ NYSE Rule 608, AMEX Rule 603 and NASD Section 23. Four commenters, Public Citizen Litigation Group (``Public Citizen''),Plaintiff Employment Lawyers Association (``PELA''), Shearson Lehman Hutton(``Shearson'') and the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') submittedcomments regarding the selection of arbitrators.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Public Citizen stated that these proposals do not go farenough to address concerns of arbitrator bias.\1\\7\<NOTE/> It observed that the qualifications for public arbitratorsare not strict enough. It believes that a three year period between securitiesindustry employment and serving as a public arbitrator is too short, particularlyin the case of one who has worked in the securities industry for a longtime. In contrast, the SIA, which endorsed the proposals with respect topublic and industry arbitrators, commented that it believed that the threeyear period established by SICA for permitting former securities industrypersonnel to serve as public arbitrators was preferable to the NYSE's fiveyear rule. The SIA stated that it thought that the five year rule wouldmake it too difficult to find public arbitrators, and commented that theCommission should suggest that the NYSE conform its rule to SICA's UniformCode. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See </T3>letters from Eric R. Glitzenstein, Esq. and Alan B. Morrison,Esq., Public Citizen, to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, and to Catherine McGuire, Special Assistant to the Director,Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 15, 1988 and February 16,1989, respectively; letter from Cliff Palefsky, Esq., PELA, to Robert Love,Special Counsel, SEC, dated December 28, 1988; letter from Robert C. Dinerstein,Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Shearson, to Jonathan G.Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated February 15, 1989; and letters from WilliamFitzpatrick, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, SIA, to JonathanG. Katz, dated February 15 and 16, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ PELA commented that while the new rules were a significantimprovement, the arbitrator pool needed to be broadened. While its commentsdid not address specifically the proposals before the Commission, PELAexpressed its view that panels should include plaintiffs' lawyers as wellas the defense lawyers that it believes now are on the panels, and thatthere are insufficient women and minorities on the panels.Also, Public Citizen objected to persons whose partners represent the securitiesindustry being able to serve as public arbitrators. Public Citizen arguedthis to be inappropriate because the economic ties between partners giverise to an appearance of bias that should exclude such persons from thepublic arbitrator pool. Public Citizen suggested that at a minimum partiesbe allowed challenges for cause against such persons. Finally, Public Citizencommented that the provision allowing professionals such as lawyers andaccountants who have received some income from securities industry clients(not exceeding 20% during over a two year period) to serve as public arbitratorsis overly permissive. It commented that 20% could constitute an attorney's``single greatest and most consistent source of income.'' Public Citizensuggested a flat rule prohibiting public arbitrators from receiving anyincome from the securities industry.\18\<NOTE/> Shearson supported the new definitions of public and industryarbitrators.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Public Citizen also expressed strong reservations concerningthe use of industry arbitrators. In particular, Public Citizen noted thatindustry arbitrators may be called upon in a particular case to interpretanti-fraud provisions which are also applicable to their business conduct.Public Citizen's letter also stated that public arbitrators are both neutraland expert, and that therefore further industry expertise is unnecessary.However, securities industry sponsored arbitration traditionally reliesupon the expertise of securities industry arbitrators, who have daily experiencewith the workings of the industry that persons unaffiliated with the industrydo not. Industry arbitrators are required to be neutral, and as discussedin Section C of this order, must disclose any possible conflict they mayhave with industry parties. The Commission cannot conclude at the presenttime that the use of industry arbitrators is inappropriate or inconsistentwith the Act. The Commission will, however, carefully monitor the operationof these proposed rule changes and will consider modifications if futuredevelopments warrant.The changes proposed regarding the classification of arbitrators are verysignificant to the continued success of SRO arbitration. These proposalsare designed to promote impartial and knowledgeable decisions in the arbitrationof disputes between investors and broker-dealers. The reclassificationof securities industry retirees to the industry arbitrator pool and thecodification of past SRO practice by establishing a three year period beforea former securities industry employee may serve as a public arbitratorshould relieve doubts that investors have had regarding the impartialityof the public arbitrator pool. Similarly, the judgment to exclude fromthe public arbitrator pool lawyers, accountants and other professionalswho regularly service the securities industry makes clearer the distinctionsbetween the two arbitrator pools.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ There are differences of judgement among the SROs' proposalswith respect to whether investment advisers ought to serve as industryor public arbitrators. The SICA draft, proposed by the NYSE and AMEX, excludesinvestment advisers from the public arbitrator pool in the hopes of addressingany possible perceptions of bias that may arise. The NASD has concludedthat because investment advisers owe their duty to investors rather thanthe industry, they are properly classified as public arbitrators. It isnot inconsistent with the Act to permit this divergence in approach amongthe SROs.The Commission believes that these proposals reflect a reasonable judgmentin striking a necessary balance in obtaining impartial and qualified arbitrators,and take appropriate account of the need to avoid arbitrarily limitingthe pool of knowledgeable public arbitrators. The three year time periodproposed by the NASD and the AMEX, and five year period of time that hasbeen proposed by the NYSE, before one who had been associated with thesecurities industry may serve as a public arbitrator, are both consistentwith the Act. Three years should be a sufficient period of time, in theCommission's view, to develop the prospective arbitrator's independencefrom identification with the industry. Five years also achieves that goaland should not be overly burdensome to the administration of arbitrationprograms.The disclosure of arbitrators' employment history and other informationalso furthers the goal of providing disinterested arbitrators for the panels.The disclosures will give parties a full understanding of their arbitrators'backgrounds, as well as the opportunity to use the disclosure informationin connection with the exercise of their peremptory and, under the NYSEguidelines, cause challenges of arbitrators. For example, the requirementunder the proposed rules \20\<NOTE/> that a prospective arbitrator disclose whether his partnersregularly represent the securities industry, coupled with the ability tochallenge a prospective arbitrator, should be sufficient to address theconcerns regarding the independence of arbitrators raised by Public Citizen.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ NYSE Rule 610(a)(2), AMEX Rule 603(a)(2) and NASD Section23(a)(2).C. Arbitrator Disclosure and Background Information to be Suppliedto the PartiesThe SROs have also proposed changes to their rules dealing with disclosuresto be made by arbitrators, and with the provision of arbitrator disclosuresto the parties. NYSE Rule 610(a) establishes the specific disclosure obligationsof arbitrators by incorporating the disclosure provisions of the AmericanBar Association/American Arbitration Association Code of Ethics for Arbitratorsin Commercial Disputes (``ABA/AAA Code'').\21\<NOTE/> The rule requires that arbitrators disclose any existingor past financial, business, professional, family or social relationshipsthat are likely to affect impartiality or might reasonably create an appearanceof partiality or bias. These disclosures extend to any relationships thearbitrators may have with any party, or its counsel, or with any individualwhom they have been advised will be a witness. Under the provision, arbitratorsare also to disclose any such relationship involving members of their familiesor their current employers, partners or business associates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ AMEX Rule 603 and NASD Section 23 also incorporate thedisclosure provisions of the ABA/AAA Code.Rule 610(b) admonishes prospective arbitrators to make a reasonable effortto inform themselves of any interests or relationships described in paragraph(a). Rule 610(c) advises arbitrators that the duty to disclose under paragraph(a) of the rule is an ongoing duty, and that any person who serves as anarbitrator must disclose at any stage of the arbitration proceeding anysuch interests, relationships, or circumstances that arise, or that arerecalled or discovered. Also, under Rule 610(d), the NYSE has clarifiedthat prior to the first session, the director of arbitration may removean arbitrator based on information disclosed pursuant to the rule. Partiesare to be informed of any information disclosed pursuant to the rule ifthe arbitrator has not been removed.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Once the arbitration panel is sworn, it controls allof the procedural aspects of the hearing. Accordingly, under the UniformCode, the director of arbitration may not remove an arbitrator after thehearings have begun. An arbitrator should be alert to the guidelines setout in the ABA/AAA Code and the applicable law with respect to arbitratorbias, and remove himself from the panel when conflicts arise after hearingshave begun. <T3>See</T3> Canon II, E. (2) of the ABA/AAA Code.As discussed above, NYSE Rule 608 \23\<NOTE/> provides that parties will be informed of the names and businessaffiliations of the arbitrators for the past ten years, as well as anyinformation disclosed pursuant to the disclosure rule at least eight daysprior to the date fixed for the initial hearing session. Under the rule,parties may also make further inquiry through the department of arbitrationconcerning the arbitrators' background.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ AMEX Rule 602 and NASD Section 21.Under the current rules, parties have been provided only with the namesand current business affiliations of the arbitrators proposed for theircases. Parties have had to request specifically any other information fromthe arbitration departments, within very short time frames. Although arbitratorswere provided with the ABA/AAA Code, there were no clear guidelines tothe arbitrators on the applicability of the code.In the Commission's September 1987 letter, the Commission recommended thatSICA make the two changes proposed in these filings to the Uniform Code'sarbitrator disclosure provisions. The Commission stated that incorporatingthe specific scope of disclosures for arbitrators contained in the ABA/AAACode into the Uniform Code's disclosure rule ``would provide the necessaryguidance to arbitrators about the types of relationships that may createconflicts of interest.''The Commission also recommended that the Uniform Code be amended to provideto the parties all of the information disclosed by arbitrators pursuantto the disclosure provision at the time when the parties are first giventhe arbitrators' names. The Commission stated that ``[f]ull disclosureof arbitrators' backgrounds to parties at the earliest possible stage inthe process should avoid unnecessary postponements of hearings and promoteknowledgeable use of challenges.''Investor confidence in the selection of arbitrators should be enhancedby these new disclosure rules. These provisions should guide arbitratorsin their efforts to make appropriate disclosures, and will permit disclosuresto be forwarded to the parties earlier to allow time for them to make decisionswith respect to challenges.D. Appointment of Replacement Arbitrators on a PanelThe SROs have also proposed two changes with respect to their ability toappoint a replacement arbitrator on a panel when a vacancy occurs. Thefirst of these changes concerns the ability of the director of arbitrationto replace an arbitrator who becomes unavailable to serve less than eightdays prior to the first hearing session. Under the existing rules, a partymay refuse to go forward on the date scheduled for the hearing if he wasnot given the eight days' notice of the replacement arbitrator's name andbackground required under existing rules. Because of the hardships thatthe SROs believe might occur if a long-scheduled arbitration hearing weredelayed due to the inability of an arbitrator to serve as arranged, SICAdeveloped a rule that permits the director of arbitration to replace anarbitrator within eight days of a scheduled hearing.\24\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ NYSE Rule 608, AMEX Rule 602 and NASD Section 21.Under the proposed amendment, if after appointment and prior to the firsthearing session an arbitrator resigns, dies, withdraws, is disqualifiedor otherwise unable to perform as an arbitrator, the director of arbitrationmay appoint a replacement arbitrator. The rule permits the appointmentof replacement arbitrators closer than eight days to the hearing. The rulealso explicitly provides that parties are entitled to receive the samedisclosure regarding the background of the replacement arbitrator as theyreceived for the initial arbitrator(s), and have the same right to requestmore information, and to challenge the arbitrator as provided in the rules,although within a shorter time frame.The second change with respect to the ability to appoint replacement arbitratorsoccurs in situations where an arbitrator resigns, dies, withdraws, is disqualifiedor otherwise unable to perform as an arbitrator after the commencementof the first hearing session. Under the existing rules, if a vacancy occursafter the hearings have begun, both parties must consent either to theappointment of a replacement arbitrator to hear the rest of the case, orto continuing with the remaining arbitrator(s). Otherwise, if that consentcannot be obtained, the case must be reheard from the beginning with afull panel.The proposed amendment \25\<NOTE/> permits the remaining arbitrators to continue with the hearingand determination of the controversy. However, under the proposal, if aparty objects, a replacement arbitrator would be appointed by the directorof arbitration under the same procedures as for the replacement of an arbitratorprior to the first hearing. The rule is designed to permit parties in particularcases to make the decision that makes the most sense for their case. Forexample, in cases where only peripheral issues have been dealt with andrelatively little progress has been made, it may make sense for partiesto request a replacement arbitrator. Conversely, where the hearings haveprogressed significantly, or are in fact substantially completed, it wouldmake less sense for parties to request a replacement arbitrator, who thenwould have to learn all that had occurred in his absence.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ NYSE Rule 611, AMEX Rule 602 and NASD Section 24. Theamendments to NASD Sections 21 and 24 relating to the replacement of arbitratorswere approved by the Commission on September 19, 1988 in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 26093 and published in 53 FR 37381 (September 26, 1988).In the event that parties do request a replacement arbitrator, it is clearthat the arbitrators have the authority to require the rehearing of partor all of the case, or to withdraw from the case, effectively requiringthe appointment of another panel, as is appropriate in their judgment.With this rule change, however, a party may no longer delay the resolutionof the dispute by insisting on a rehearing whenever an arbitrator unexpectedlyis unable to continue in his hearing of a case. These changes should promoteincreased efficiency in the administration of SRO arbitrations while atthe same time preserving important safeguards that provide full disclosureof arbitrator backgrounds to the parties and permit parties to requestmore data and exercise challenges.E. Availability of Small Claims Procedures and the Number of ArbitratorsRequired to Hear a ClaimThe NYSE and NASD also proposed to increase to $10,000 from $5,000 themonetary claim limit for cases to be heard under the simplified proceduresdeveloped in the Uniform Code. Under these procedures, a single arbitratordecides a case based upon the papers submitted by the parties. No oralhearing is held unless requested by the investor, or ordered by the arbitrator.This change is designed to decrease the costs of arbitration.The proposal also would change the number of arbitrators used for largecases from five to three.\26\<NOTE/> The NYSE stated in a letter to the Commission's staff thatthis proposal is the result of the Exchange's difficulty in schedulingarbitrations with five arbitrators.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ These changes were submitted earlier to the Commissionby the AMEX, and were approved on November 28, 1988 in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 26315, and published in 53 FR 48995 (December 5, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The AMEX also proposes to amend its Rule 608(e) to clarify the factthat charges under the arbitration rules imposed for requesting adjournmentsdo not apply to cases administered under the simplified procedures. Thischange conforms the AMEX rule to the Uniform Code and NYSE Rule 617(b)and NASD Section 30(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See</T3> letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary,NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Esq., Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated January 16, 1989.The NASD and AMEX proposed a technical amendment, in NASD Section 13 andAMEX Rule 621, regarding the single arbitrators used in cases administeredunder the simplified procedures. The amendment codifies the existing practiceof appointing a public arbitrator as the single arbitrator in the case.The NYSE has confirmed that it administers its existing rule to requirethe appointment of a public arbitrator. The NYSE staff has indicated thatit will recommend that the NYSE clarify this point through amendments toits rules this year.The NASD has also submitted a proposal, that has not been adopted by SICA,AMEX or the NYSE, that would permit the NASD to appoint a single arbitratorfor cases administered under its regular procedures where the amount incontroversy is $30,000 or less. Under proposed NASD Section 9(a), a partymay, however, request in its initial filing that the NASD appoint a panelof three arbitrators. The NASD stated that its proposal was designed toreduce costs and delays in the administration of cases, while preservingthe opportunity for parties to have their cases heard before a full threemember panel. The Commission believes that these changes also promote efficiencyin the administration of the process without reducing procedural protectionsfor the parties.F. DiscoveryThe Commission requested in the September 1987 letter that SICA adopt significantchanges to the Uniform Code's discovery provisions. The Commission's letterpointed to the ``need for the SROs to expand existing procedures in orderto provide both for the resolution of discovery disputes by [an arbitrator]prior to the hearing and for prehearing conferences and preliminary hearingsfor cases that are sufficiently complex to warrant such procedures.'' Theletter also called for the Uniform Code to provide parties the abilityto seek the deposition of witnesses in appropriate cases.Under the existing rules, parties have been enacted to exchange documentsinformally and voluntarily. Nevertheless, the Commission's letter pointsout, parties sometimes ``refuse to turn over documents that are, in theirview, privileged or irrelevant. Customer complaints and other documentsevidencing supervision or lack of supervision of a registered representative,which are in the sole possession of the industry party and are often relevantto a complainant's case, should be turned over in a timely fashion.'' Partiesmay also request documents pursuant to subpoena under the existing rules,but these do not have to be produced until the day of the hearing.The Commission's letter stated that it did not believe that existing rulesprovided sufficient time for a party to prepare for a hearing. The letteralso pointed out that the risks to parties resisting production were inadequateto promote compliance with the rules. ``The practical problem under theUniform Code [has been] that the requestor does not know whether, on theday of the hearing, he is going to argue over discovery matters only orwhether the arbitrators will proceed to resolve the case on the merits.''The discovery rule proposed in these filings meets the concerns raisedin our September 1987 letter.The discovery rule developed by SICA expands party access to prehearingdiscovery and provides specific time frames for parties to request informationfrom parties and for responding to such an information request. The rulealso establishes a mechanism for prehearing conferences and for arbitratorinvolvement in prehearing matters where needed. The SROs also have explicitlyrecognized the appropriateness of depositions in particular circumstances.Under the proposed rule changes, arbitrators may order depositions whenappropriate. More specifically, the rule states that an arbitrator in aprehearing conference may issue any ``ruling which will expedite the arbitrationproceeding or is necessary to permit any party to develop fully its case.''\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ In its explanation of this provision of the discoveryrule, the NYSE stated that the arbitrator appointed to resolve discoverydisputes ``may issue subpoenas, direct appearances of witnesses, directthe production of documents and <T3>depositions,</T3> and set deadlines and issue any other ruling whichwill expedite the hearing and permit any party to develop fully its case.''(emphasis added) In addition, the training manual for arbitrators developedby the NASD, AMEX, NYSE and other members of SICA specifically contemplates,at page 8, the ability of arbitrators to order depositions. Accordingly,we understand the language in all of the SRO rule filings included withinthis approval order to be broad enough to encompass the ability of a singlearbitrator or panel of arbitrators to exercise their discretion to orderdepositions. Since arbitrators' jurisdiction is limited, the ability toenforce arbitrators orders for depositions of non-parties or of personsnot affiliated with a member of the sponsoring SRO may depend upon whetherrelevant arbitration law provides for depositions in aid of arbitration.Proposed NYSE Rule 619(a) \2\\9\<NOTE/> continues the policy established under existing rules forparties to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in the voluntary exchangeof documents and information. In the event that voluntary exchanges arenot sufficient, the rule establishes a clear framework for document productionand information requests.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ AMEX Rule 607 and NASD Section 32 address the discoveryissues addressed in NYSE Rule 619.Proposed NYSE Rule 619(b) provides that a party may serve a written requestfor information or documents twenty days after service of the claim orupon the filing of the answer, whichever is earlier. All parties are toreceive copies of the request, and parties are required to endeavor towork out disputes regarding the request between themselves before an objectionto the request is filed. Unless the requesting party allows more time,information requests must either be satisfied or objected to within thirtycalendar days from the date of service. The party who made an informationrequest has ten days from receipt of the objection to respond to the objection.Under the proposal, a party whose information request has not been satisfiedmay request in writing that the director of arbitration refer the matterto a prehearing conference. Parties may also find that there are othermatters in addition to unresolved information requests that require theassistance of a prehearing conference. NYSE Rule 619(d) provides that thedirector of arbitration may appoint someone to preside over the prehearingconference. The prehearing conferences could be held either in person orby telephone conference call, and are designed to help the parties to reachagreement on such matters as the exchange of information, exchange or productionof documents, identification of witnesses, identification and exchangeof hearing documents, stipulations of fact, identification and briefingof contested issues, and any other matter which will expedite the arbitrationproceedings.When a prehearing conference is unable to resolve any of these issues,NYSE Rule 619(e) provides for the director of arbitration to appoint asingle arbitrator to decide the issues outstanding. In its filing, theNYSE stated that the rule allows the arbitrator to issue subpoenas, directappearances of witnesses, direct the production of documents and depositions,and set deadlines and issue any other ruling which will expedite the hearingand permit any party to develop fully its case. The AMEX and NASD haveamended their filings to provide that the single arbitrator appointed todecide prehearing matters would be a public arbitrator in those cases wherepublic customers have requested a majority of public arbitrators for theirpanel. Staff at the NYSE has confirmed that it will recommend that itsgoverning board adopt this amendment to its rules this year.Other amendments to the prehearing provisions require parties to serveon one another at least ten days prior to the first hearing copies of documentsin their possession that they intend to present at the hearing and identifywitnesses they intend to present at the hearing. Under proposed NYSE Rule619(c), arbitrators may exclude from the arbitration, documents not exchangedor witnesses not identified at that time. The provision does not extendto documents or witnesses that parties may use for cross-examination orrebuttal.\3\\0\<NOTE/> In addition, the SROs are proposing to amend their rulesregarding subpoenas. In NYSE Rule 619(f), the NYSE proposes to requireparties to serve copies of all subpoenas on all parties.\3\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ The NYSE proposes to delete the provisions of NYSERule 638, which paralleled this provision in certain respects.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ The AMEX and NASD have placed the provisions dealingwith subpoenas and the power of arbitrators to direct appearances and productionof documents in separate rules consistent with the Uniform Code. (AMEXRules 610 and 611, and NASD Section 33) The NYSE proposal incorporatesthese provisions into its discovery rule. There is no substantive differencebetween the proposals.Public Citizen, PELA, and SIA, Shearson and Jeffrey Bauer, Esq. (``Bauer'')\3\\2\<NOTE/> commented on the proposed amendments to the prehearing provisions.Public Citizen expressed support for the proposals but stated its viewthat the proposals do not go far enough to provide investors with adequatediscovery.\3\\3\<NOTE/> Public Citizen and PELA commented that restrictive discoveryfavors the industry over investors in light of their view that broker-dealersare more likely to have documents and other information necessary to provea case against the firm, and the fact that a claimant has the burden ofproof.\3\\4\<NOTE/> PELA commented that parties should have a right to depositions.Public Citizen suggested that it would be reasonable for parties to beable to have one or two depositions in a case. In effect, Public Citizencalled for parties to have access to depositions where ``necessary to develop[one's] case, and [where one] cannot obtain equivalent information fromdocuments alone * * *''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Jeffrey Bauer, Esq. to Howard Kramer, AssistantDirector, SEC, dated February 10, 1989. Bauer is a securities and commoditiesattorney.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ Public Citizen also questioned whether the rules ondiscovery apply to small claims proceedings (up to $10,000) administeredunder simplified procedures, because such cases may be conducted withoutan oral hearing. NYSE Rule 601(1), AMEX Rule 621(1) and NASD Section 13(1)make it clear that unless otherwise provided, the general arbitration rulesapply to all cases, under both the simplified and regular procedures, and,accordingly, the discovery rules apply to the simplified procedures, withoutregard as to whether there is an oral hearing or simply a hearing on thepapers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ Bauer expressed the concern that the discovery provisions(as well as other provisions that contain time frames, such as those dealingwith the submission of pleadings) do not contain specific sanctions forfailure to meet time frames. He commented that arbitrators ought to havethe ability to assess fines or costs against parties who do not meet thetime frames in the rules.The SIA stated that it does not object to arbitrators ordering the depositionsof non-party witnesses who are unable to attend the hearing. The SIA expressedconcern that depositions not be used to delay the proceedings, but statedthat the proposed rule is sufficiently flexible to permit arbitrators toorder depositions to allow parties to develop fully their cases.\3\\5\<NOTE/> Shearson supported the ``strengthening of the discovery process.''Shearson stated that the proposed rules will ``further enhance investorconfidence in the system'' and do not ``attempt to incorporate excessivelitigation procedures and inordinate delays into'' the arbitration process.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ The SIA also raises a question concerning the effectof the inclusion in NYSE Rule 619, entitled GENERAL PROVISION GOVERNINGPRE-HEARING PROCEEDING, of the provision of former NYSE Rule 620 regardingthe ability of arbitrators to direct the appearance of persons associatedwith a member or the production of records in the possession or controlof such persons. The SIA exprssed concern that the repositioning of therule might have the effect of granting the single arbitrator assigned toresolve prehearing issues the additional ability to require industry personnelto appear before the single arbitrator prior to the hearing. Arbitratorshave that authority under both versions of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="28">There is nothing in either the Uniform Code or the NYSE's rule thatwould preclude an arbitrator from ordering the appearance of an employeeof an SRO member prior to the initial hearing on the merits. It is appropriatethat arbitrators have this flexibility under the rules. Both the AMEX andthe NASD retained their provisions regarding the ability of arbitratorsto direct appearances of persons and documents in separate rules, as doesthe Uniform Code. In the Commission's view, neither placement affects themeaning of the provision, and the language of the balance of the prehearingprovisons makes it clear that an arbitrator acting as a single arbitratorunder the rule may direct appearances of witnesses and the production ofdocuments. Likewise, the NYSE's placement of this provision does not restrictthe ability of the full arbitration panel to order the appearance of witnessesor production of documents at the hearing, notwithstanding the captionfor the rule.</ITAG>The Commission believes that the SRO discovery rule proposals should increasethe efficiency of arbitration proceedings and provide substantially greaterprotections for public participants. Provisions requiring parties to notifyone another of subpoenas and of witness and document lists all move awayfrom surprise at the hearings and towards the goal of reaching fair andaccurate resolutions of disputes. We believe that the timetables imposedin these rules set necessary discipline to preserve the speedy nature ofarbitration, properly provide impetus for the parties to make initial effortsto work out discovery disputes and, accordingly, are in the public interest.The language in the rule providing for the ability of an arbitrator actingas a single arbitrator to issue any ``ruling which will expedite the arbitrationproceeding or is necessary to permit any party to develop fully its case''substantially meets the concerns expressed by Public Citizen regardingthe ability of investors to obtain depositions. The NYSE's explicit recognitionthat this provision includes the ability of arbitrators to order depositions,the new training manual developed by SICA, and the comment of the SIA thatthe rule as now drafted permits the arbitrators the discretion to ordera deposition where a party can demonstrate to the arbitrators that a depositionis necessary to develop a case all support this view.\36\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\There are differences in the text of the NASD rule concerningthe ability of a single arbitrator to issue orders before a hearing fromthe text of the NYSE and AMEX rules. The NASD has not yet amended its ruleto include the language ``or is necessary to permit any party to developfully its case.'' In a letter from Frank J. Wilson, Executive Vice Presidentand General Counsel, NASD, to Catherine McGuire, Special Assistant to theDirector, SEC dated April 18, 1989, the NASD stated that before it canconform its rule to the NYSE and AMEX rules, this language must be consideredand approved by the NASD National Arbitration Committee and Board of Governors.In the interim, there should be no negative inference from this omissionin the NASD's rule. In a letter from Frank J. Wilson to Catherine McGuire,Special Assistant to the Director, SEC dated April 19, 1989, the NASD acknowledgedthat arbitrators have authority under various statutes to exercise thediscretion to order depositions of persons who are unable or unwillingto attend hearings. The concern over excessive use of depositions is not frivolous. This concernshould not be permitted, however, to avoid the proper use of depositions.The Commission's approval of this portion of the discovery rule is basedon our clear understanding that depositions will now be available as amatter of routine to parties in appropriate cases. This rule grants partiesaccess to depositions to preserve the testimony of ill or dying witnesses,or of persons who are unable or unwilling to travel long distances fora hearing, as well as to expedite large or complex cases, and in othersituations deemed appropriate by the arbitrators. These rules make an appropriatechoice in our view, by leaving to the arbitrators' judgment the need fordepositions and other discovery. SICA and the individual SROs can evaluatethe implementation of these rules, and to the extent necessary, expanddiscovery available as of right or impose sanctions for the failure tocomply with time frames established under the new procedures. In that connection,we expect the SROs to monitor the use of depositions in arbitrations administeredunder their auspices, and to track arbitrators' action on requests fordepositions. The Commission believes that the rule proposals promote the purposes ofthe Act in aiding investors to discover the documents and other informationthey need to prove their cases. If experience with these rules suggeststhat arbitrators need additional authority to manage these proceedings,we are confident that SICA and the SROs will move to adopt them. G. Preservation of a Record NYSE Rule 623 would codify a requirement that a verbatim record by stenographicreporter or tape recording be maintained.\37\<NOTE/> The rule further provides that if a party to a proceedingelects to have the record transcribed, the cost of such transcription shallbe borne by that party unless the arbitrator(s) direct otherwise. If arecord is transcribed at the request of a party, the rule requires thata copy shall be provided to the arbitrators. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\AMEX Rule 614 and NASD Section 37. In its September 10, 1987 letter, the Commission requested that SRO arbitrationdepartments amend their rules to assure that records of arbitration proceedingsare made and preserved. These records are necessary for courts to use inconjunction with any review of the proceedings they may make. The Septemberletter suggested that records be made either with high quality tape recordings,or by engaging a court reporter to record testimony, which can later betranscribed on request. The Commission believes that the SRO proposalswould assure the preservation of a record of each arbitration proceedingand therefore facilitate an appropriate court review. H. Content and Public Availability of Arbitration Awards The SROs' proposed rule for arbitration awards expands both the contentand public availability of arbitration awards. Proposed NYSE Rule 627 providesthat awards shall contain the names of the parties, a summary of the issuesin controversy, the damages and/or other relief requested, the damagesand/or other relief awarded, a statement of any other issues resolved,the names of the arbitrators and the signatures of the arbitrators concurringin the award.\38\<NOTE/> The awards, including any written opinion voluntarily preparedby the arbitrators, are to be made public, except that the names of customerparties to the arbitration will be excluded if the customer parties requestin writing that their names not be included on the public version of theaward.\39\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\AMEX Rule 618 and NASD Section 41. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\In the NASD's version of the award rule, Section 41 ofits Code of Arbitration procedure, investors do not have the option ofexcluding their names from the public version of the award. In addition,the NASD's proposal would exclude the arbitrators' names from the publicversion of the awards. Instead, the NASD proposes to make available uponrequest to parties in a particular arbitration matter, full copies of allawards rendered by the arbitrators chosen to decide their case. The NASDproposal also requires parties to request the proposed arbitrators' previousawards within three days of having been notified of the persons to serveon the panel. The Commission requested such a rule in its September 1987 letter. Priorto the proposals made in this filing, the only information available tothe public regarding SRO arbitration cases was the percentage of investorsthat received some portion of the amount they claimed against their broker-dealer.No data has been available with respect to particular arbitrators' awards.The proposal developed by SICA affords substantially more public accessto the results of this process of dispute resolution.Six of the commenters, Public Citizen, PELA, the SIA, Shearson, RichardRyder, Esq. (``Ryder'') \4\\0\<NOTE/> and Bauer, commented on the proposals for arbitration awards.Public Citizen and PELA called for the awards to include written decisionsthat include the arbitrators' reasons for their awards. Public Citizencommented that the verbatim records of the hearings are insufficient fora court to apply the ``manifest disregard'' standard \4\\1\<NOTE/> in the review of an arbitration award, and that a court mustknow arbitrators' reason in order to apply the standard. In this respect,Public Citizen expressed its preference for the traditional, judicial adherenceto precedent over the more <T3>ad hoc</T3> factual determinations it stated were contemplated in thesearbitration proposals. Public Citizen also commented that reservationsexpressed by SICA in its response \4\\2\<NOTE/> to the Commission's September 10, 1987 letter with respectto the ability of arbitrators to capture in an opinion the consensus processof arbitrators, were strained, and in its opinion were directed at concernsthat flaws in the decisionmaking process would be exposed to challengein the courts if arbitrators' rationales were known.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Richard Ryder, Esq. to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,SEC, dated February 14, 1989. Ryder is the publisher of a newsletter onsecurities and commodities arbitration.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith </T3>v. <T3>Bobker</T3>, 808 F.2d 930 (2d Cir. 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ <T3>See</T3> letter from the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitrationto Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, datedDecember 14, 1987.PELA stated that legal issues are often dispositive in employment casesbetween broker-dealers and registered representatives, and that these issuesdiffer from state to state. Therefore, PELA commented, written opinionswould be necessary in order to make decisions about whether to appeal arbitralawards.\4\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ PELA also commented that arbitration panels may haveno lawyers or only defense lawyers and that ``[i]n many cases, arbitrationcounsel (actually an employee of the NASD) told the arbitrators what thelaw is. This is unacceptable and fundamentally unfair.'' The letter furthercommented that legal advice by SRO staff, including training materials,should be on the record. It stated ``[l]itigants simply have the rightto know what the arbitrators are told by outsiders about the law that isto be applied.'' Although this comment does not directly address any ofthe rule proposals before the Commission, the conduct described by PELA,if it actually occurs, would be unfair, and unacceptable in SRO arbitration.The SROs have assured the Commission that SRO staff is not permitted toadvise abritrators on the law. Further, all training materials are availableto the public.After careful consideration of whether awards ought to include reasonsfor arbitrators' awards, as is advocated by Public Citizen and PELA intheir comment letters, we have concluded that it would not be appropriateat this time to require the inclusion of written opinions in awards.This rule change already represents a significant movement in the explicationof the arbitral process. We believe that it would be in the public interestto allow the SROs and parties a period of time to adjust to this rule,and to await any independent development on the part of the arbitratorsthemselves to develop written opinions. In the labor area, arbitratorshave voluntarily developed a practice of writing opinions in order to helpthemselves understand developments in the labor arena.\4\\4\<NOTE/> The opinions were not mandated and were not developed toenable courts to review arbitral decisions.\4\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Jennings and Martin, The Role of Prior ArbitrationAwards in Arbitral Decisions, Labor Law Journal (February 1978).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ Even if awards contained errors of law, it is importantto recall that under applicable law, a mistake of law is not currentlygrounds for vacating an arbitration award.<ITAG tagnum="28">The error must have been obvious and capable of being readily andinstantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator.Moreover, the term ``disregard'' implies that the arbitrator appreciatesthe existence of a clearly governing legal principal but decides to payno attention to it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Bobker</T3>, at 933. The data already included in the awards underthis proposal together with the pleadings and the verbatim record of thecase ought to be sufficient in making determinations under the currentmanifest disregard standard.We also believe that there is merit in the arguments proffered by SICAwith respect to the process of consensus that often may precede the reachingof a decision. Arbitrators may ultimately reach agreement on an award,a dollar amount, without ever reaching agreement on the reasons for theaward. Finally, the Commission is concerned that imposing a mandatory requirementfor written opinions at this time could slow down the arbitration processand discourage many persons from participating as arbitrators. At present,we do not believe that the benefit obtained from requiring written decisionsoutweighs these concerns.\4\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ We also anticipate, however, that SICA will soon renewits consideration of issues important to the successful administrationof large and complex cases. It may be appropriate to provide for writtenopinions for such cases.The SIA, Ryder and Bauer expressed different concerns with respect to theSRO's proposals regarding awards and stated that various portions of theproposal are problematic, and may not be of much use to prospective parties.The SIA stated that it believes that knowledge of past awards may not behelpful to the parties in their evaluations either of particular casesor arbitrators. Because the arbitral awards are typically the product ofa consensus of the views of arbitrators, the SIA argues that it is unlikelythat an award for which an arbitrator voted would necessarily reflect thespecific views of that arbitrator, but rather only the product of compromisebetween the members of the panel. The SIA further commented that theseawards would be unlikely to be accurate indications of the voting recordsof arbitrators because cases tend to be fact intensive, and therefore eachcase unique. The SIA also expressed some concern over the summaries tobe prepared of each case. It stated that summaries are likely to be subjectiveand would vary among the SROs. The SIA stated its opinion that SRO staffswould be likely to draft these, which could result in characterizationswith which parties would not concur. The SIA suggested that claimants berequired to supply the summaries. Shearson, in contrast, stated that therules regarding the contents and public availability of arbitration awardswill further enhance investor confidence in arbitration without excessivelyburdening the process.Making awards publicly available is in our view very significant to promotinginvestor confidence in the arbitration system. Clearly, awards renderedby arbitrators in prior cases will not predict the vote or outcome of futurecases. The awards will, however, provide greater public understanding ofthe arbitration process.\4\\7\<NOTE/> Moreover, while the Commission cannot evaluate the strategicvalue of information regarding past awards in which a particular arbitratorparticipated, we note that some of this historic information has been compiledby individual industry participants for their own cases. Investors, whoare typically one time users of the arbitration system, do not have accessto any such information. The Commission believes that it is preferablefor information on past arbitrations to be equally available to all parties.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ We also disagree with the SIA's assumption that thesesummaries will likely be prepared by SRO staff and will become subjectto criticism by the parties. Our understanding is that awards will be theresponsibility of the arbitrators, and that they will represent the arbitrators'understanding of the issues in controversy. If draft awards are preparedby SRO staff, they are under the supervision of the arbitrators and subjectto arbitrators' review and approval.Ryder commented that arbitrators' names should not be available to thepublic. He stated that because the arbitrators are not professional arbitrators,but rather volunteers, they should not be exposed to public criticism forunpopular awards, such as, for example, a case where an industry arbitratorvoted for punitive damages to be awarded against a broker-dealer or itsemployees. He also stated that publication of arbitrators names would belikely to encourage the media to contact arbitrators to discuss a particularcase, in conflict with the general practice of arbitrators not to discusscases on which they have served, and without the protection of arbitrators'immunity. This he believes would expose arbitrators to criticism and discouragethem from serving. He further argues that this is weighed against limitedinsight to be gained from the review of the one or two arbitral awardstypically rendered per year by an arbitrator, which may not be a probativesample. He commented that at a minimum, the Commission should approve onlythe NASD approach to awards, which would disclose arbitrators' names onlyto parties in specific cases.The Commission believes that Ryder overemphasizes the pressure that maybe brought to bear upon arbitrators whose names are made public, eitherby the press who seek to discuss an award or by members of the communitywith respect to unpopular awards. We expect that arbitrators are sufficientlycompetent and resolved to abide by their obligations not to discuss cases.Individual SROs have submitted different proposals regarding how widelythey will disclose the names of arbitrators for particular cases. Bothchoices appear reasoned with proper consideration for the needs of theparties, the public and the arbitrators. As the SROs gain experience withthese new procedures, one version or the other may develop as clearly preferable.We see no reason to disturb the discretion of the SROs on this point.Ryder also questions the fairness under the rule proposals of the NYSEand AMEX of requiring the public disclosure of industry parties to an arbitration,but not of the investors' names. Resolution of disputes between investorsand broker-dealers has a public as well as private purpose. It is importantfor the public to be aware of the number and nature of allegations againstbroker-dealers registered with the Commission and their employees. To theextent that individual investors choose to keep proceedings regarding theirprivate finances shielded from public secrutiny, then the traditional notionsof privacy in arbitration are not inappropriate, and should be preserved.The potential embarrassment to securities employees as a result of claimsin arbitration proceedings of misconduct or error, however, is subservientto the public's need to know about these cases.Ryder also suggests that the awards contain more information relating tothe date of the arbitration filing; the city in which the hearings tookplace; the number and date of the hearings; the names of the attorneyswho represented the parties, if any; the primary product or investmentvehicle involved in the dispute; and the date the award was rendered. Hestated that this information would be relatively simple to include andwould better permit vendors of the information in arbitration awards toanalyze the efficacy and speed of arbitral awards. He also suggests thatthe resulting data would be useful for case settlement, brokerage housecompliance efforts, and regulatory oversight.In response to these suggestions the SROs have amended their filings toinclude data he suggested, including the dates the claim was filed andthe award rendered, the number and dates of hearing sessions and the locationof the hearing(s). The type of investment vehicle involved is likely tobe included already in the summary of the issues in controversy. The SROshave determined not to include at this time the names of the parties' counselin the awards. The Commission does not believe that the disclosure of theparties' counsels' names would provide significant benefit to persons inthe arbitration process. Accordingly, we believe that the SRO proposalsin their amended form are consistent with the Act.I. Arbitration FeesThe SROS have also clarified through these rule filings the potential feesto parties of pursuing a case through SRO arbitration. The arbitrationfee proposals represent significant increases in the fees that may be assessedby the arbitrators for particular cases.The definition of a ``hearing session'' has been clarified in the proposal.A hearing session under proposed NYSE Rule 629(b) \48\<NOTE/> would be a meeting between the parties and arbitrators thatlasts less than four hours. For the AMEX, which previously considered ahearing session to be a full day of hearings, the proposal increases thefees that may be assessed against a party. The NASD changed its practicewith respect to the assessment of fees, from a full day to a half day,in June of 1987 resulting in a similar fee increase. This filing fulfillsthe NASD's obligation pursuant to Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4 to filea rule change with the Commission in light of its change in policy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ AMEX Rule 620 and NASD Section 43.Proposed NYSE Rule 629(d) also would raise to $200 from $100 the minimumdeposit for cases where no money damages are claimed. Proposed NYSE Rule629(h) and AMEX Rule 620(h) set a fee for prehearing sessions with an arbitratorof seventy-five percent of hearing session fees.\49\<NOTE/> Further, proposed NYSE Rule 629(a) of the filing proposesthat all parties who file claims, such as counterclaims, cross-claims andthird party claims, now should be required to pay deposits. Under the existingrules, deposits are required only of original claimants. This significantlyincreases the potential fees that may be recovered by the SROs and assessedagainst a party since arbitrators may assess costs against a single party.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ The fee for prehearing sessions with an arbitrator underNASD Section 43 is the same as the fee for hearing sessions.Proposed NYSE Rule 629(c) also clarifies that arbitrators may assess thecosts of conducting a hearing against the parties as they deem appropriate.These costs include not only the fees for each session, but all other costsof conducting the hearing contemplated under the rules, such as the costsof transcribing a record, or producing witnesses or documents, and anyother cost contemplated by the agreement between the parties or permittedby applicable law.Two commenters, PELA and the SIA, wrote regarding the appropriateness ofthe fee increases in the proposals. PELA, without being specific, statedthat the fees increases are an unfair barrier to dispute resolution. TheSIA commented that the fees probably are appropriate, in light of the factsboth that the SROs continue to subsidize the forum to a substantial extentand that the fees are, in its view, lower than for other arbitration forums.The Commission believes that these arbitration fee increases are justifiedon the basis of the rule's deference to the ability of the arbitratorsto allocate fees and forum costs fairly among the parties. None of thesefees are automatically imposed on either party. The SROs also have advisedthe Commission that the fees collected in recent years are a relativelysmall portion of the cost of administering their programs.\50\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ For example, the NYSE has advised us that its costs foradministering its arbitration program, excluding rent allocation, for theyears 1987 and 1988 were $1,967,000 and $2,693,000, respectively. It recovered$790,000 in 1987 and $1,264,000 in 1988 through the arbitrators' assessmentof fees. The NASD reported that its costs for fiscal year 1986-1987 were$4,968,072 and for fiscal year 1987-1988 were $7,086,344, while it recoveredin fees $402,543 in fiscal year 1986-1987 and $1,342,414 in fiscal year1987-1988. The AMEX reported that its costs, excluding rent allocation,for 1987 and 1988 were $183,500 and $187,100, respectively, while it recoveredin fees $46,760 in 1987 and $48,360 in 1988.We intend to monitor the future administration of this rule closely. Coststo investors for SRO arbitration historically have been low, and must remainso. The application of these fees should not be permitted to operate ina manner that weighs too heavily on individual parties or serves as a disincentiveto pursuing the redress of investors' grievances against broker-dealersor their associated persons.We conclude that in light of the costs of administering the arbitrationprograms and the need for continued SRO subsidies, and the role of thearbitrators in allocating fees in each case, the fee increases appear tobe reasonable and the procedure for allocating them provide for an equitableallocation consistent with Sections 6(b)(4) and 15A(b)(5).J. Predispute Arbitration ClausesThe SROs, through the auspices of SICA, developed two rule changes designedto improve disclosure to customers in account opening agreements,\51\<NOTE/> and to restrict the content of the arbitration clauses.\52\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ On July 8, 1988, the Commission sent to all SROs thatadminister arbitration programs a letter requesting that they examine issuessurrounding their members' use of predispute arbitration clauses. The letterfollowed a study by the Commission staff of 65 broker-dealer firms thataccount for approximately 90% of all customer trading accounts in the UnitedStates. Ninety-six percent of the margin accounts, 95% of the options accountsand 39% of the cash accounts at those firms at the time of the study weresubject to predispute arbitration clauses. At least five of the nation'slargest broker-dealers, with offices around the country, currently do notrequire the signing of account agreements for individual cash accountsthat do not otherwise require documentation in connection with other servicesprovided in the account, such as individual retirement accounts or trusteecontrolled accounts. For example, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, A.G. Edwards,Dean Witter, and Kidder Peabody do not require an individual to sign onaccount agreement for such cash accounts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ NYSE Rule 637, AMEX Rule 427 and Article III, Section21 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.The proposals would require broker-dealers that employ predispute arbitrationclauses to place immediately before the clause introductory language thatwould inform customers that they are waiving their right to seek remediesin court, that arbitration is final, that discovery is generally more limitedthan in court proceedings, that the award is not required to contain factualfindings and legal reasoning, and that the arbitration panel typicallywill include a minority of arbitrators associated with the securities industry.The proposal requires that the disclosure language be highlighted fourways. First, large or otherwise distinguishable type must be used. Second,the disclosure language must be set out in outline form so as to be noticeableto readers. Third, a statement, also highlighted, that provides that theagreement contains a predispute arbitration clause, and where that clauseis located in the contract, must be inserted into the agreement immediatelypreceding the signature line. Fourth, a copy of the agreement containinga predispute arbitration clause must be given to the customer, who is toacknowledge receipt of the agreement, either in the agreement itself orin a separate document.\53\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ The version of the rule as developed by SICA includesa provision that requires that customers initial the statement advisinginvestors that the contract contains an arbitration clause. In commentsreceived by SROs from their members before these filings were submittedto the Commission, SRO members argued against the initialling requirement,stating that the initialling proposal would create operational difficulties(where investors had not initialled) without providing any correspondingadditional investor protection. These firms also expressed concern overthe legal significance of the initialling provision. None of the SROs hasincluded the initialling provision in its submission to the Commission.The proposal also prohibits SRO members from having agreements with customersthat limit or contradict the rules of any SRO or limit the ability of aparty to file any claim in arbitration or limit the ability of the arbitratorsto make any award.Four commentators, Public Citizen, PELA, the SIA and Shearson, commentedon the provisions relating to the use of predispute arbitration clauses.Public Citizen welcomed the improvement to the system for notifying investorsabout the existence and effect of arbitration clauses, but stated thatthe proposed rules are inadequate for the protection of investors. PublicCitizen's preferred result would be a rule flatly prohibiting broker-dealersfrom limiting or conditioning access to brokerage services on the signingof a predispute arbitration agreement.\54\<NOTE/> Accordingly, Public Citizen comments that, at a minimum,investors should receive notice when presented with a predispute arbitrationclause that they are receiving nothing in return for signing the arbitrationagreement. Public Citizen reasons that as public customers already havethe right under SRO rules to demand that their broker-dealers and registeredrepresentatives arbitrate any dispute that may arise, the arbitration clausecreates obligations only for the customers. Consequently, Public Citizenstates that SICA's initialling provision \55\<NOTE/> should be adopted by the SROs in order to assure ``that [publiccustomers] at least [are] aware of the fact that they are agreeing to sucha one-sided arrangement, and expressly signal their approval of it.'' PublicCitizen also adds that consideration, in the form of discounted commissionrates, should accompany any agreement to arbitrate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ PELA also called for a prohibition of mandatory arbitration.Its letter is principally directed at broker-dealer/employee cases andthus addresses issues different than those being considered by the Commissionin these proposals. PELA considers the amendments represented in thesefilings, without greater employee/investor choice, and without proceduresmore like the courts, to be merely cosmetic.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ <T3>See </T3>footnote 53.Both the SIA and Shearson endorsed the concept of disclosure regardingthe arbitration clauses contained in the proposals. The SIA commented thata disclosure approach is appropriate with respect to the clauses, whileadditional choice would presume that there was something wrong with arbitration,counter to the Federal Arbitration Act.\56\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Public Citizen also commented that the SROs should submita rule establishing procedures for class action litigation and joinderprovisions. Public Citizen suggests that such procedures would permit partiesto resolve collectively ``repeated patterns of statutory violations thatsimply are not worth individual investors time and resources to pursue.''In testimony on July 12, 1988 before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunicationsand Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, SEC ChairmanDavid Ruder addressed the need for the SROs to consider special procedures,or the declination of jurisdiction over class action litigation.<ITAG tagnum="28">The SROs' arbitration rules already include provisions allowing forthe joinder of claims. The SROs are improving the guidance provided toarbitrators with respect to their existing ability under the arbitrationrules to refer certain cases back to the courts. The arbitration agreementsof the parties include the obligation to abide by the arbitration rules,which provide that arbitrators may refer parties to their remedies at law,and that SROs may decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Although no SRO rule has been submitted, SICA is considering a policywhereby all SROs will decline jurisdiction over class action litigationunless the class certification and representation issues have first beenresolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. At that time, under theSROs' existing rules, both the SROs and the arbitrators for a particularcase may determine whether the facilities of the SRO are adequate to handlethe litigation, or whether parties should be referred to their remediesat law.</ITAG>The disclosure provisions set out in the new rule address many of the concernsregarding customer notice and choice that have been considered over recentyears in open Commission meetings, the courts, and in hearings before theHouse Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the Committee onEnergy and Commerce. All new arbitration agreements will be required tocontain clear and highlighted disclosures alerting investors to the meaningof the arbitration contracts they are signing. This, in turn, we anticipateshould promote more knowledgeable acquiescence or rejection by customersof arbitration provisions. The combined effect of the newly mandated disclosuresand the notice immediately prior to the signature line, advising investorsof the existence and location of the arbitration clause, will sufficientlyfocus any reader of the customer agreement to the arbitration provisions.In that connection, we are unable to conclude that the marginal benefitsto investors of mandating that there be a separate initialling of the provisionpointing to the existence of the arbitration clause, on top of the multipledisclosures already being mandated warrant overruling SRO judgment as tothe costs and operational burdens on members of such a requirement.The Commission believes that the new provision in the rule prohibitingfirms from including in their agreements any condition which limits orcontradicts the rule of any SRO \5\\7\<NOTE/> or limits the ability of a party to file any claim in arbitrationor limits the ability of the arbitrators to make any award benefits investors.This provision makes clear that the use of arbitration for the resolutionof investor/broker-dealer disputes represents solely a choice of arbitrationas a means of dispute resolution. Agreements cannot be used to curtailany rights that a party may otherwise have had in a judicial forum. Ifpunitive damages or attorneys fees would be available under applicablelaw, then the agreement cannot limit parties' rights to request them, norarbitrators' rights to award them. The agreements may not be used to shortenapplicable statutes of limitation, restrict the situs of an arbitrationhearing contrary to SRO rules, nor to limit SRO forums otherwise availableto parties.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ This part of the proposed rule change is a clear statementof existing law. <T3>See generally, </T3>sections 6(b), 15A(b), 19(g) and 29 of the Act,and NYSE Arbitration Rule 600(a), Article VIII, Sections 1 andamp; 2 of theAMEX Constitution, and section 12(a) of the NASD's Code of ArbitrationProcedure.The Commission has concluded that approval of this rule, which does notinclude provisions mandating customer choice with respect to the signingof arbitration clauses, is consistent with the Act. Under the circumstancespresented, the Commission is reluctant to dictate the terms of a fullydisclosed agreement between a broker-dealer and a customer. Investors currentlyhave access to basic brokerage services without agreeing to pursue anyfuture disputes through arbitration, rather than through the courts. Thisis so because a number of broker-dealers, including several large full-servicebroker-dealers in the country, do not require the signing of account agreementsfor cash accounts.\5\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission recognizes that investors do not have suchaccess with respect to margin and options accounts, but observes that withrespect to margin accounts, the firms' separate lending relationship withthe customer may increase the desirability of agreeing in advance thatdisputes will be resolved through arbitration. Moreover, the Commissionbelieves that the improved disclosure provided in the rules will effectivelyalert investors as to the consequences of signing predispute arbitrationclauses. To the extent that a class of investors emerge who object to predisputearbitration agreements, the Commission is hopeful that competitive forceswill result in some firms offering margin or options accounts without suchagreements. Additionally, pricing strategies may arise that provide fordifferent rates to be charged to customers who do not agree to predisputearbitration provisions. The Commission, however, will carefully monitorthe effectiveness of the SRO disclosure provisions as well as any increasedusage of predispute arbitration agreements for cash account customers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ <T3>See</T3> footnote 51 <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>The Commission welcomes the changes in SRO arbitration heralded by theseproposals, and the cooperative effort that produced them. These rules representseveral years of effort by SICA. They represent the promise of the SROsto maintain fair and efficient forums for the arbitration of disputes betweenmembers and investors. The Commission believes that the proposed rulesappropriately balance the need to strengthen investor confidence in thearbitration systems at the SROs, both by improving the procedures for administeringthe arbitrations and by creating clear obligations regarding the use bySRO members of predispute arbitration clauses, with the need to maintainarbitration as a form of dispute resolution that provides for equitableand efficient administration of justice.\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ Public Citizen also suggested in its July 15, 1988letter that the Commission should have used its authority uder section19(c) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78s(c)] to institute the changes to the SROs'arbitration rules, rather than by recommending changes as was done in ourSeptember 10, 1987 letter. The September 1987 letter was not, and shouldnot be viewed as, a formal invocation of Commission rulemaking. As theCommission staff stated in its reply to Public Citizen, the letter wasthe result of the staff's review of SRO arbitration pursuant to the Commission'sresponsibilities under sections 17 and 19 of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78q and78s]. (<T3>See</T3> letter from Catherine McGuire, Special Assistant to the Director,SEC, to Eric R. Glitzenstein and Alan B. Morrison, Public Citizen, datedJanuary 27, 1989.) Moreover, the September 1987 letter identified areaswhere the Commission believed that improvements were needed, but did notitself make specific rule proposals.<ITAG tagnum="28">Open and continuous dialogue with the SROs on all matters, includingthe need to consider regulatory changes, is essential to the working ofthe scheme of self-regulation established by Congress. This process hasincluded significant public dialogue, and all commenters' views, includingthose expressed by Public Citizen, have been considered in the contextof these rule filings pursuant to Rule 18b-4.</ITAG>In particular, the rule changes affecting the classification of arbitrators,arbitrator disclosure, discovery, the preservation of a record, the formand public availability of awards, and guidelines for the use of predisputearbitration clauses dynamically advance the public interest in SRO arbitration.Likewise, the SROs' initiatives with respect to the handling of pleadings,appointments of replacement arbitrators, the use of small claims procedures,and the number of arbitrators should improve the efficiency and speed ofarbitration, maintaining those bargained for qualities of traditional arbitration.Because these rules will aid in the just resolution of disputes betweeninvestors and broker-dealers, we conclude that these rules are designedto prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, promote just and equitableprinciples of trade and in general, protect investors and the public interestconsistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6). The fee increases representedby these changes appear to be reasonable and provide for an equitable allocationof fees among SRO members and investors using the arbitration facilitiesconsistent with sections 6(b)(4) and 15A(b)(5).  Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposals submitted by the NYSE,NASD and AMEX are consistent with the requirements of the Act, specificallysections 6(b) (4) and (5) and 15A(b) (5) and (6), which require that nationalsecurities exchanges and registered securities associations have rulesdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promotejust and equitable principles of trade, provide for an equitable allocationof fees, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.\6\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\The Commission finds that there is good cause to approvethe proposed amendment to Article III, section 21 of the NASD's Rules ofFair Practice prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publicationof notice of filing in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The NASD published a substantially similar draftof this rule for its members' comment on November 1, 1988. NASD members,in a vote concluding on April 3, 1989, voted 1,411 in favor of the proposedrule, and 237 for disapproval. In addition, the NYSE's and AMEX's versionsof the same rule were published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 26, 1989, providing the public withample opportunity to comment on the proposed rule change.  <T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the above mentioned proposed rule changes be, and hereby are, approved.\6\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\The proposed rule changes to NYSE Rules 607, 608, 610,611, 619, 623 and 627; AMEX Rules 602, 603, 607, 608, 610, 614, 618, 621and 622; and NASD Sections 21, 23, 32, 37, 41 and 45 are effective uponapproval. The proposed rule changes to NYSE Rules 601, 612 and 629; AMEXRules 606 and 620; and NASD Sections 9, 13, 19, 25, and 43 are effectiveonly for cases filed with the SROs after this approval; The proposed rulechange to NYSE Rule 637, AMEX Rule 427 and Article III, Section 21 of theNASD's Rules of Fair Practice will become effective September 13, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
