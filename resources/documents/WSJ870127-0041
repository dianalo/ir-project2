Magnet, a federal savings bank with assets of about $652 million, last October agreed in principle to be acquired by First Federal, a mutual association, in a stock transaction valued at about $33.5 million. First Federal has assets of about $2.6 billion.    John Cobb, Magnet's president, said &quot;First Federal simply felt, after trying for two months to structure a workable deal, that the merger would have been too complex.&quot;    When Magnet said in December that the $19-a-share acquisition by First Federal had stalled, nervous depositors withdrew more than $1 million in funds in 24 hours.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Magnet closed at $8.50, down $1.875 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
