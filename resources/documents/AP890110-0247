In the 1950s, Sen. Joseph McCarthy achieved notoriety for hispurges of suspected Communists, brandishing a piece of paper in hishand and charging that he had a list of ``card-carrying'' members ofthe Communist Party.   Fast was one of those members. He confronted McCarthy at ahearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) andwent to jail in 1950 for refusing to submit names of alleged``subversives.'' Thirty-eight years later, Fast has reconstructedthat time in a novel, ``The Pledge'' (Houghton-Mifflin, $18.95).   ``Bush's campaign had something of the same feeling. That`card-carrying ACLU' device was worked out very precisely,'' saidFast, author of ``The Dinner Party,'' ``Citizen Tom Paine'' andother works.   ```Pledge' is based on a part of my life that was a great time offear in the United States, and this generation should learn thatthis happened. None of them know,'' he said in an interview.   ``The Pledge'' begins in post-World War II India and centers on awar correspondent, Bruce Bacon, who has reason to believe that theBritish government played a role in the famine then sweepingCalcutta. His actions come to the attention of the British and U.S.governments and he is ultimately forced to leave the country.   Back home, Bacon resumes his job as a prized newspaper reporterfor the New York Tribune, but his world becomes unraveled.Determined to pursue his theory of British collusion in the famine,Bacon attracts the attention of the FBI and is subpoenaed by HUAC.   He is asked about his alleged ties with members of the Indian andAmerican Communist parties and also about his love relationship withMolly Maguire, a writer for the Communist Party's newspaper. Heangrily refuses to answer any questions about Maguire, lashes out atthe committee, is removed from the hearing room and goes to jail forcontempt of Congress.   ``This has nothing to do with democracy,'' Fast said. ``It hasnothing to do with the United States. This book is a true book.Eighty percent of it happened to me. What didn't happen to mehappened to people I know.''   Fast was born Nov. 11, 1914, in New York, the son of a factoryworker. His first published novel, ``Two Valleys,'' appeared in1933. Four years later the success of his novella, ``The Children,''enabled him to write full-time.   Like many liberals in the 1930s, Fast was a bitter opponent ofAdolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and later joined the CommunistParty as a way of fighting fascism. His books were written from adecidedly left-wing point of view.   ``I've run into kids who told me I have taught them Americanhistory. I have educated them in the best meaning of the UnitedStates. I would like to have millions read `Pledge,' but that's nottoo likely.''   During World War II, Fast was a member of the overseas staff ofthe Office of War Information and in 1945 went to Europe as acorrespondent for ``Esquire'' and ``Coronet'' magazines.   ``I discovered one interesting thing in World War II,'' Fastrecalled. ``For most people involved in a war, it's a picnic, aholiday. A way to break up a bad marriage.   ``To me, war is unspeakable. It's murder condoned. You aremurdering a human being who has not harmed you, who you don't knowand will never know.''   After his prison term he ran for Congress in 1952 as a candidatefor the American Labor Party.   ``I had a sense of outrage after being released and I didsomething that I would advise no writer to do,'' said Fast, easilydefeated in the election. ``I based my campaign on ending the war inKorea.''   Fast left the Communist Party in 1956, and even wrote a book,``The Naked God,'' about his disillusionment, but remains acommitted liberal. He is currently working on a new novel, based onthe story of a priest murdered in Honduras.   ``I feel an unending sense of horror of what people do to eachother. I once saw (the novelist Theodore) Dreiser down on ParkAvenue South and tears were rolling down his cheeks. He said, `I wasjust looking at people, looking at the street. I could not stand theway things were.' It broke my heart.''   In ``The Pledge,'' Maguire repeatedly teases Bacon about his``innocence,'' his endless disbelief that people are capable of suchevil. Fast, despite his war experiences and his time in prison,considers himself an ``innocent'' as well.   ``If you have a conscience instilled in you, you have to begin toask yourself certain questions. Millions of Germans are askingthemselves, `How could we do it?' It comes at different stages todifferent people,'' he said.   ``I feel it all the time, but this is my own pain and I don'twish this on everyone else.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 20-22</NOTE></DOC>
