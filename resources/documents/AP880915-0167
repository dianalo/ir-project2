The committee also approved legislation that would require thatforeign fishing vessels stow their gear when passing through the200-mile U.S. economic zone and carry transponders so satellitescould track their location.   Those proposals were attached to a new U.S.-Soviet fishingtreaty and were sought by Washington state lawmakers after sevenJapanese trawlers were videotaped fishing in American waters offAlaska in January.   Along with the change in the territorial limit, the measure alsoincludes an expansion of the so-called U.S. contiguous zone from 12nautical miles to 24 nautical miles.   The measure was approved on a voice vote.   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., sponsor of the bill, said theexpansion of the territorial limit will allow the United States toexercise complete control over a broader area and was essential fornational security reasons.   The new limit will force foreign intelligence vessels to stayfurther offshore, said Lowry.   ``By moving our territorial sea from three miles to 12 miles,the ability of Soviet ships to monitor and detect the movement ofU.S. submarines is lessened,'' said Lowry.   The expansion of the contiguous zone will allow the UnitedStates to enforce such things as its customs laws and pollutionregulations over a broader area, said Lowry.   Lowry said the expansion would ``enhance our nation's ability tointercept and board vessels which may be carrying contraband ordrugs off our coast.''   ``With a 24-mile contiguous zone, the Coast Guard would be ableto board a foreign-flag vessel out to 24 miles, without seeking theconsent of the foreign flag nation. This would clearly enhance ournation's drug enforcement authority,'' he said.   Lowry said that both zones would be ``consistent with customaryinternational law'' and that the Reagan Administration wasconsidering such changes through an executive order.   The new requirements for foreign fishing vessel passing throughthe U.S. economic zone were approved just weeks after reports inthe Japanese press of a organized black market in Japan for fishcaught illegally in American waters.   American fishermen estimate that Japanese trawlers have caughtillegally more than 100,000 tons of fish worth an estimated $250million off Alaska since the first of the year.   Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said present law allows the CoastGuard to take action against foreign trawlers only if they arecaught illegally fishing in U.S. waters.   ``Many of these vessels are alerted to the presence of the CoastGuard and haul up their nets before they are discovered,'' saidBonker.</TEXT></DOC>
