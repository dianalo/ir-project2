There were no notes from the jury Wednesday, the third day ofdeliberations. The panel of eight women and four men was resumingits work today.   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructingCongress and two counts of making false statements. Each chargecarries a maximum five-year prison term and a $250,000 fine.   Poindexter's lawyers expressed concern over jury instructionsabout 5,000 messages that Poindexter erased from his computersystem. Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Harold Greene toclarify the instructions, but the judge refused.   The destruction of the messages is included in an obstructioncharge alleging the former national security adviser tried toconceal from Congress the U.S. role in the Hawk shipment.   The jurors asked for copies of the messages, which were saved ona backup tape at the White House.   Greene rejected the jurors' request Tuesday, saying the noteshadn't been introduced as evidence at the trial and so ``you can'thave them.''   Defense attorneys said Wednesday the judge may have misled thejury into believing that it couldn't consider other evidence aboutthe messages.   Among that evidence is a stipulation _ a statement agreed to byprosecutors and the defense _ that none of the messages were from1985, when the Hawk missiles were shipped to Iran. The inferencethat could be drawn is that Poindexter did not cover up evidenceabout the Hawk shipment by erasing the messages.   The Hawk shipment is the focus of the indictment againstPoindexter. Ten days after 18 missiles were delivered by a CIAproprietary airline to Iran, Poindexter had President Reagan sign adocument which ratified the shipment.   The document depicted U.S. involvement in an arrangement totrade arms for hostages.   Poindexter tore up the document on Nov. 21, 1986, hours aftertelling Congress he hadn't found out about the Hawks shipment untiltwo months after it occurred.   He destroyed the document eight days after Reagan said in anationally televised address that ``we did not ... trade weapons... for hostages.''   The prosecution contends that Poindexter lied to Congress tohide the existence of the presidential document.</TEXT></DOC>
