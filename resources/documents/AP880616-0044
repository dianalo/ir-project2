But Simon said Bush's statement that he wants to be the``education president'' sounds like ``an election-year conversion.''   ``After eight years of not lifting one finger while the WhiteHouse'' was seeking deep cuts in education, Simon said, ``Mr. Bushhas a great credibility problem with the claim that he intends tobe `the education president.'''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Lance Says Party Unity Required For Democrats To Win White House</HEAD><DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga.
