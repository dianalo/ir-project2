The House Energy and Commerce Committee's transportation subcommittee plans to consider next week a draft bill for restoring regulatory powers over railroad rates and track access that were deregulated in 1980.    Supporters, who include electric utilities and coal companies, argue that the bill would shield some &quot;captive&quot; shippers from railroad monopolies. But railroads say the legislation would bring back the financial woes that plagued the industry before it was partly deregulated seven years ago.    The bill would &quot;result in the deterioration of the nation's railroad system,&quot; said L. Stanley Crane, chairman of Consolidated Rail Corp. During visits yesterday to transportation subcommittee members, Mr. Crane warned that the legislation would cause the &quot;same type of railroad bankruptcies five or seven years out that we had in the early 1970s.&quot;    The presidents of the rail units of Burlington Northern Inc. and Union Pacific Corp. also visited the panel members. The lobbying efforts followed requests by the Association of American Railroads, a trade group, for help to defeat the bill it calls &quot;the most serious threat to the viability of railroads in two decades.&quot;    But supporters say the bill will just &quot;fine tune&quot; the 1980 law, by requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect the 15% of shippers that are captive to a single railroad. &quot;The legislation will provide lower rail rates for captive shippers,&quot; said Rep. Frederick Boucher (D., Va.), who proposed the measure.    The legislation would shift to railroads the burden of proving that their rates to captive shippers are reasonable, making it easier for a shipper to challenge a rail rate before the ICC. Other provisions would make it more difficult for railroads to deny shippers the right to route their freight to competing railroads.    Though some shipper groups have lobbied for such measures for three years, reregulation provisions were gutted from a House bill last year. Even if the latest bill were to be approved by the full committee, it probably would face a lengthy battle on the House floor and in the Senate.    &quot;Rates of return are low in the railroad business now, and they would get even lower&quot; if the bill became law, said Jeffrey Stone, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. Other rail specialists believe that if rates are held artificially low on captive commodities like coal and grain, railroads won't be able to make up the difference by raising rates on merchandise traffic, which can easily move by truck.    Railroads have won the support of a broad group of shippers, including General Motors Corp., Procter andamp; Gamble Co. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., which have resisted changes because they believe deregulation has improved service and lowered rates.    Rail executives maintain that rates have fallen in recent years as competition rose. Even large utilities, including Kansas City Power andamp; Light Co. and Potomac Electric Power Co., say they have secured contracts from railroads that have sharply reduced their coal hauling rates. But both utilities continue to clamor for legislation to protect captive shippers.    &quot;Railroads predictably have been more reasonable during this time of congressional scrutiny,&quot; said Robert Szabo, executive director of Consumers United for Rail Equity, a group representing utilities and coal producers. &quot;They have been trying to buy out their opposition&quot; by signing contracts with low freight rates. </TEXT></DOC>
