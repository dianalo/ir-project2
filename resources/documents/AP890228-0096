The report said that the lifetime treatment cost for a patientwith acquired immune deficiency syndrome is about $60,000, a figurethat may change as treatment improves.   The report gives these estimates for the numbers of AIDS patientsdiagnosed in the indicated year and total lifetime medical cost ofthose patients:   _ 1988: 39,000 AIDS new cases, total lifetime medical treatment$2.6 billion.   _ 1989: 54,000 cases, $3.5 billion.   _ 1990: 71,000 cases, $4.7 billion.   _ 1991: 91,000 cases, $6.0 billion.   _ 1992: 114,000 cases, $7.5 billion.   Fred J. Hellinger, an economist at the National Center for HealthServices Research and Health Care Technology Assessment and whocompiled the study, said the estimated $60,000 lifetime medical costper patient is lower than some earlier estimates because AIDSpatients now are spending less time in hospitals and receiving morecare as outpatients.   Hellinger said that research by three insurance organizationsestimated that about $50,000 will be paid by health insurers foreach AIDS patient. For the study, he added $5,000 for expenses notcovered by the insurance companies and another $5,000 for the costof AZT, an antiviral drug approved by the Food and DrugAdministration in 1987.   ``The costs of treating an AIDS victim may fall because treatmentthroughout the nation becomes more effective,'' Hellinger said.``But it is also possible that treatment costs may continue to varydramatically across sites and that the approval of new drugs totreat AIDS patients will increase longevity and, thereby, offset anysavings realized through more effective treatment.''   The study's projections of the numbers of new AIDS cases is basedon the 72 percent increase in diagnosed cases during the last twomonths of 1987 and the first six months of 1988. Hellinger said thestudy assumed that this trend would continue indefinitely.   Hellinger's study appeared in Inquiry, a journal publishedquarterly by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
