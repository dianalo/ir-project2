Banks have established subsidiaries to raise money by taking assets, usually mortgages, from the parent institution and issuing securities backed by those assets or preferred stock. In April, the FDIC set forth guidelines designed to ensure their safe operation by state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal Reserve System.    After reviewing the public comments on the proposed policy, however, the agency decided it already had the necessary regulatory tools to guard against abuses.    During a meeting yesterday, the FDIC's board also delayed to June 30, from Dec. 31, the effective date for the agency's rule banning banks from sharing a name or logo with a securities firm. The delay will allow the FDIC to study requests from several banks that it reconsider the rule, which was issued in 1984.    In addition, the board postponed to July 1, from Jan. 1, the effective date of a policy requiring banks to disclose all enforcement actions against them to the public. FDIC Chairman William Seidman wants the Fed and the Comptroller of the Currency to agree on a uniform policy before the rule takes effect.    The board also agreed to establish a consumer affairs office to handle complaints about banks from the public. The FDIC's bank supervision division had been handling such matters. </TEXT></DOC>
