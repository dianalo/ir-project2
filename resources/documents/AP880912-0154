The General Accounting Office, in a report for Sen. David Pryor,D-Ark., said employees of three subsidiaries of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board are, in fact, federal employees and should besubject to civil service pay classifications. The top civil servicesalary is $75,500 a year.   The bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 savingsassociations, has set up the three subsidiaries since 1972, in twoof the cases specifically to get around salary limits. Topexecutives of the subsidiaries are paid six-figure salaries.   The Office of Regulatory Activities was created in 1986 as theOffice of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision, or ORPOS,to formulate regulations and to oversee Sandamp;L examiners that work forthe 12 district Federal Home Loan Banks. It has 146 employees.   The district banks serve as a central banking system for thesavings and loan industry and are outside of the federalbureaucracy, but the GAO said regulatory office employees took overfunctions previously conducted by the board itself and should beconsidered part of the federal government.   A second subsidiary, the Federal Asset Disposition Association,was set up in 1985 to dispose of billions in dollars of loans andforeclosed real estate from failed Sandamp;Ls. It is the largest of thethree with 313 employees.   Its president, Gerald P. Carmen, is a former head of the GeneralServices Administration, which manages government property, and aformer political fund raiser for President Reagan. He is paid$150,000 a year.   The third entity, the Office of Finance, has 52 employees andwas formed in 1972 to oversee the issuance of debt to fund the bankboard and the district banks.   ``We believe the bank board acted improperly in creating ORPOS,the Office of Finance and FADA as entities whose employees are notsubject to the salary limitations,'' Milton J. Socolar, specialassistant to the comptroller general, said in a letter to Pryor.   According to bank board officials, the effects of forcing thethree subsidiary agencies to abide by the salary caps ispotentially devastating. Analysts in part blame the Sandamp;L industry'sproblems on the inability of the bank board in the early 1980s topay enough to attract experienced examiners.   By placing the examiners outside of salary caps, the bank boardhas been able to build up its staff, in part by hiring examinersaway from other banking agencies.   The report for Pryor, chairman of the federal services, postoffice and civil service subcommittee of the Senate GovernmentalAffairs Committee, is the latest blow against FADA, which has beencriticized by members of Congress as both too slow and tooexpensive.   Banking legislation approved by the House Banking Committeeearlier this summer would abolish FADA, forcing the bank board'sinsurance fund to reassume the disposition agency'sresponsibilities.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said agencyofficials believe it will take court or congressional action toenforce the GAO findings. He contended that if the findings wereenforced, many of the employees would be hired away by bigaccounting firms and financial institutions.   ``We feel its important that we keep and retain these people. Tolose that kind of talent, particularly in the regulatory area,would be devastating,'' he said.   Hoyle said about a dozen of the 500 employees in the threesubsidiaries are paid more than the top salary within the federalcivil service.   Pryor, in a statement released with the report, also complainedthat the three subsidiary agencies are exempt from federal conflictof interest and procurement rules.   ``Something is drastically wrong. ... We have created amonstrous bureaucracy with almost no oversight by the Congress,''he said. These officials ``don't seem to have to comply withfederal conflict of interest laws or federal salary caps. Yet theyhave the decision of life or death over hundreds of theseinstitutions.''</TEXT></DOC>
