Apart from rectal examination,only imaging techniques allow evaluation of the extension of the cancer.Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with a Magniscan 5000(Thomson C.G.R., France) apparatus. Three types of sequences were used:a short RT sequence (30/500, a multi-echo sequence with a long RT (40/2500)and echo gradient sequences (12 scans in less than 3 minutes). The MRIstudy of the pelvis is favoured by the abundance of fat which gives goodcontrast, spontaneous visualization of the vessels and the presence ofthe bladder with a high signal for urine in T2. This provides a verygood anatomical study in three planes. In prostatic cancer, the studyof the long sequence signal reveals heterogeneity of the prostatic signalon the second echo, but this is a non-specific variation. The stagingof prostatic cancer is facilitated by scans in three planes. Differentexamples are presented in relation to various stages of the disease.Three clinical cases demonstrate that Magnetic Resonance may become animportant element in the choice of treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
