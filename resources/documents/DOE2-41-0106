Initial efforts proved the concepts underlying the technologyof vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) and confirmed their suitabilityfor electrical generation applications. Following the 1973 oil embargo,activities were incorportated into the broader NRC program of energyresearch under the auspices of the Interdepartmental Panel on EnergyRandamp;D (PERD). From 1975 to 1985 the NRC wind energy program continued thedevelopment of he VAWT through tests on small models and joint fieldtrials of significant size prototypes in cooperation with potential userssuch as utilities. Increased understanding of the basic charcteristiscsof the wind resource and the energy conversion systems led to creationof analytical models from which design tools and techniques evolved foruse by Canadian industry. Prototype commercial units up to 0.5 MW ratingwere under test by fall 1984 when the decision was taken for NRC to eliminateits PERD-related energy research activities. This report chronicles thetechnical and infrastructural aspects of the program, describes the natureand extend of wind energy resources in Canada, outlines the basic characteristicsand primary relationships of the technology, provides a current synopsisof the state-of-the-art of wind turbine technology in Canada, and enumeratespriorities and recommendations for further development. It presents aprespective on Canadian achievements and opportunities through summariesof the major wind energy activities in other countries through summariesof the major wind energy activities in other countries of the Westernworld. 231 refs., 33 figs., 13 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
