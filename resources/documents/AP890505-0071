Col. Oliver L.North are producing disagreement in Congress, but most of thosecommenting concur that North should spend little or no time in jail.   Many conservatives called for a prompt pardon by President Bush.Other members of Congress _ including some conservatives _ saidthat would be premature at best and that the judicial processshould be allowed to run its course.   Former President Gerald R. Ford, whose pardon of ex-PresidentRichard Nixon caused a furor and may have cost Ford re-election,declined to give Bush advice on the subject.   ``I have very strictly taken the position that it would beinappropriate for me to comment on that publicly. ... It's a veryvery personal (decision) to the presidnet, as I found out from myown experience,'' said Ford on ABC's Good Morning America.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House investigatingcommittee, said on ``Today'' this morning that ``this is not aninstance where a presidential pardon is appropriate, nor is it aninstance where he should have extended sentence....''   Hamilton said earlier that the ``fact that Col. North was in adifficult position does not absolve him of his responsibility, butit may go toward mitigation of his punishment.''   Opinions varied widely on the federal jury's split decision _convicting North on three charges, acquitting him on nine others _and on the ultimate meaning of his role at the heart of the mysteryknown as the Iran-Contra affair.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said on CBS ``This Morning'' thatwhile he opposes a pardon, the commutation of a prison sentencewould be ``totally appropriate.''   ``I don't think there should be a prison sentence. I don't thinkthere ought to be any kind of a harsh sentence at all. I do thinkit is important to establish for the future that there's noambiguity, that no matter what you think other people may haveordered, you simply can't rip up documents and you can't misleadthe Congress as long as national security wasn't involved,'' saidFrank.   ``I think he's a very tragic figure,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman,R-N.H., vice chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee. ``But Ifind no evidence of remorse on his part because he really believeshe was doing what he was supposed to do.   ``I do not think Oliver North understands to this day what theconstitutional issues were all about,'' Rudman said.   Daniel L. Casey, president of the American Conservative Union,called on Bush to pardon North and Richard A. Viguerie, chairman ofthe United Conservative Union, declared that ``Oliver Northdeserves a medal, not a prison sentence.''   ``I predict there will be an avalanche of conservative outcryfor President Bush to pardon Ollie,'' Viguerie said.   ``I think George Bush should pardon him,'' said Sen. OrrinHatch, R-Utah, who was one of North's stoutest defenders in theIran-Contra probe.   But Hatch and other senators said that step would almostcertainly cause political problems for Bush, similar to those facedby Ford when he pardoned Nixon in the Watergate scandal.   ``The president's problem is that if he does pardon him therewill be shouting and screaming from the same partisans who havebeen out to hang North from the beginning,'' Hatch said.   Some of Hatch's conservative colleagues disagreed on the pardonissue.   ``I do not want to see a pardon because I think the court systemis working very well,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., also opposed a pardon saying,``The man was indicted and the jury decided that the facts upheldthree of the indictments. It's obviously a tragedy for him and hisfamily. But no one is above the law.''   ``As a former prosecutor I wasn't surprised at the verdict,''said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. ``What the jury is saying veryclearly is that North shouldn't be taking the blame for the wholething, he shouldn't be a fall guy.''   But Leahy said a presidential pardon would ``make a mockery ofthe whole system.''   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee, said a pardon would be ``outrageous.''   ``I take the president at his word that there will be nopardon,'' Biden said and added: ``It seems to me the jury came tothe conclusion that you cannot lie and that you are not allowed togo ahead and shred documents, that you are responsible for youractions, that you still have to obey the law even though someoneelse told you to do it.''   Former President Reagan, on whose watch North took the actionsthat resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal and his trial by jury,declined to comment because North still faces a long process ofcourt hearings and appeals.   But Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the chairman of the SenateIran-Contra Committee, said the decision reaffirms the panel'sfindings that North and the others involved in the Iran-Contraaffair ``showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system ofgovernment.''   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who also served on the Iran-Contracommittee, said he felt ``Colonel North was left twisting in thewind by an administration he served with all his heart and soul.''</TEXT></DOC>
