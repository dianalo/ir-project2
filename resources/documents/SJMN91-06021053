The city has about 59,000 voters.;    Butlersaid the county Registrar of Voters should be able to certify the results ofsuch an election within a week, so the person who wins could be seated at thenext council meeting, on Jan. 29.;    The candidates agree that Sunnyvale iswell governed but have differed on such issues as the number of terms acouncil member can serve; whether the mayor should be elected directly by thepublic rather than the current system, where the mayor is chosen by councilmembers from among their own ranks; and whether the city should build amunicipal performing arts center on city land near Town andamp; Country Villageshopping center.;    Bahl and Briody insist the city already is committed tothe performing arts center, with Briody saying the city should try to savemoney on architectural details.
