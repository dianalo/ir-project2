The first letter, inthe order of receipt, was from Mr. Don L. Weesner, General Manager forthe San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District (District). The initialarea of concern to the District was the possible inability of the SCIPto compete with Arizona Public Service in serving large loads such as thefederal facility at Florence, Arizona. The District felt that the proposedgeneral rate schedule that would be applicable to the facility would reducethe price advantage of electric power service provided by SCIP.The Bureau realizes that the proposed general rate schedules will decreasethe price advantage that SCIP currently provides, but the new rates willstill provide a competitive advantage over the rates offered by the neighboringelectric utility companies within the service area. Without the proposedincrease, SCIP would not be able to generate the revenues needed to upgradethe system required to service its current as well as future industrialand governmental loads.The District's second concern relates to the impact the proposed rateswould have upon customers who operate private irrigation pumps. In orderto minimize the possible adverse economic impact upon this class of customers,the District has recommended establishment of a separate rate schedulespecifically for private irrigation pumping. The recommendation meritsfurther consideration: however, SCIP is not in a position to establisha separate rate schedule for private irrigation pumping at the presenttime. The proposed rate schedules were developed from a rate study whichconsidered the proportionate overall economic contribution of all SCIPcustomers within the schedules No. 1 and No. 2.The second written comment received by the Bureau of Indian Affairs wasfrom Mr. Thomas R. White, Governor, Gila River Indian Community. His firstconcern related to the justification for the rate schedules as proposed.As explained in the proposed rules published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 10, 1987, the last assessment rateincrease for the San Carlos Irrigation Project_Power Division was fiveyears ago. Since that time, normal costs for labor, materials and suppliesneeded to deliver safe, reliable, and efficient power and energy to allof its customers has increased substantially. The revenues generated fromthe assessment rate increases will enable us to continue the rehabilitationand upgrading program that is currently in progress. For instance, theLone Butte Substation recently completed and energized on the Gila RiverReservation. This substation provides a power and energy delivery pointto the Gila River Indian Reservation.Mr. White recommended that SCIP provide a detailed plan of improvementsand rehabilitation to the system so the power customers will be assuredof a systematic approach to the rehabilitation program. A rehabilitationand betterment report is available in the Project office.Further, Mr. White expressed concern related to the assessment rate increasein the midst of H.R. 2060, a bill to direct the Secretary of the Interiorto divest of certain utility systems without a plan of improvements. In1984, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Phoenix Area Office, prepared for theproject Engineer a draft Rehabilitation and Betterment Report for the SanCarlos Irrigation Project Power System. The Report (Plan) was presentedto both the District and Gila River Indian Community for their review andcomment. The Plan provided a construction schedule and cost estimates forthe rehabilitation and betterment of the entire power system. Until relievedof its responsibility by enactment of the proposed legislation and actualdivestiture of the power system by the United States, SCIP has a continuingobligation to operate, maintain and replace the facilities of the powersystem.The third letter received by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was from Mr.Steve Jones, Executive Director of the Gila River Indian Housing Authority.The concern expressed in his letter was the financial hardship the assessmentrate increase may have upon the low-income families. The ``Electric RateStudy'' prepared by the San Carlos Irrigation Project in January 1984 insupport of the assessment rate increases recognized the probable impactsupon the low-income families within the whole service area. Exhibit B,page 2 of that Study reads, ``The Project's residential customers thathave a low KwH usage per month, are characterized by a low fixed income;therefore, it is determined that no increase in the minimum bill will berecommended at this time.'' Rate Schedule No. 1_Residential, provides thesame minimum bill of $10.74 per month which includes the first 50 KwH ofenergy as is currently in effect. Increases for low and/or fixed incomefamilies will occur after consumption of energy in excess of 50 KwH.Finally, one statement in the Federal Register notice of the proposed rateschedules must be changed as a result of advice received from the Solicitor'sOffice of the Department of the Interior. In discussing where power revenueswill be spent in the future, the Federal Register notice stated that: ``Theadditional revenues will allow the Project to meet its statutory repaymentrequirements and also enable the Project to apply funds towards the operationand maintenance of the irrigation system.''In a recent opinion, the Phoenix Field Solicitor held that there is nostatutory authority which would allow the Project to use power revenuesto cover irrigation system operation, maintenance and rehabilitation (OMandamp;R)costs. The Field Solicitor held that under the Act of March 7, 1928 (45Stat. 210-211), as amended (49 Stat. 1822-1823) power revenues obtainedfrom the sale of project_generated power may be applied to irrigation systemOMandamp;R costs only after the total construction debt has been repaid.The Field Solicitor's opinion also stated there is no authority in theAct of August 7, 1946 (60 Stat. 895-896), to use power revenues obtainedfrom the sale of purchased power to cover irrigation system OMandamp;R costs.The authority to issue rules and regulations is vested in the Secretaryof the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and Sections 463 and 465 of the RevisedStatutes (25 U.S.C. 2 and 9). This final rule is published in exerciseof authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the AssistantSecretary_Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. In monetary terms, the economic effects of the proposed amendmentwill be below $100 million and do not meet the other tests for a majorrule under E.O. 12291. The Department of the Interior certifies that thisdocument will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 etseq.). The expected effect on the approximately 1,500 individual and commercialelectric power meters will be small and insignificant; and, in monetaryterms, the proposed action involves approximately $750,000 of additionalrevenue per year for the Project. The anticipated impacts on competition,employment, investment and the general economic environment are minimaland insignificant. Furthermore, the Department has determined that thisdocument does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe human environment which would require preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Theinformation collection requirement in Section 177.4 has been approved bythe Office of Management and Budget under the Paper Work Reduction Act(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and assigned clearance number 1076-0021.
