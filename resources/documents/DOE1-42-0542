The objective of this volume is not onlyto describe the environmental problems of energy production and utilization,but also to provide solutions to these problems. The technology is availableto solve the environmental problems and the societal framework of lawsand regulations are now being developed. The volume is divided into fiveparts. The first part considers environmental problems created in themining of coal, petroleum, natural gas and radioactive materials. Parts2, 3, and 4 consider consequences of utilization of fossil fuels, hydropower production and nuclear power generation. The final part treatsthe political, economic and humanistic aspects of energy utilization.This is a comprehensive collection of technical papers written by scientists,engineers and social scientists on the important environmental issuesinvolved in supplying energy to a complex industrial world.</TEXT></DOC>
