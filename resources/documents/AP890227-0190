Opposition leader Gilberto Cuadra said the presidents' backing``is necessary, apart from our own efforts'' to ensure fairelections in Nicaragua.   The government party, the leftist Sandinista National LiberationFront, already has begun what amounts to a veiled election campaign,with President Daniel Ortega as the obvious candidate.   Also Monday, Ortega sent the National Assembly a proposed decreethat would pardon 1,932 former members of ousted dictator AnastasoSomoza's hated and feared national guard. The assembly will considerthe decree Tuesday.   Cuadra heads the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, the mostimportant association of private business executives in Nicaragua,and is a member of the delegation that left Monday.   He said the delegates will meet with President Oscar Arias onTuesday in San Jose, the Costa Rican capital, and with PresidentCarlos Andres Perez in Caracas, Venezuela, on Thursday.   Cuadra said they will discuss the accord which Ortega, Arias andthe presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras reached at asummit in El Salvador on Feb. 14.   Ortega agreed then to institute reforms to guarantee freeelections, which he called to be held Feb. 25, 1990, 10 months aheadof schedule. Nearly every elective post will be on the ballot, frompresident and National Assembly deputies through town mayors.   The five Central American presidents also agreed to draft by May14 a plan to dismantle the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel force. Anestimated 11,000 rebels, known as Contras, are living in camps withtheir families in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.   While the opposition continues trying to form a united front _ byall indications its only chance at winning the presidential race _the Sandinistas are making it increasingly clear their nominee willbe Ortega.   The first placards calling for Ortega to run for re-electionappeared at a rally Saturday in Masaya, 17 miles south of Managua.   ``We will win the 1990 elections just like we won the 1984elections,'' Ortega told the rally.   Interior Minister Tomas Borge meanwhile was telling foreigncorrespondents in Managua that the Sandinista Front had not yetchosen a presidential candidate.   Ortega said in a televised interview on Feb. 15 that running forre-election ``is no sin,'' the closest he has come to saying he willrun for another term.   Ortega had promised to release the former guardsmen at the Feb.14 Central American summit.   His decree names 1,932 ex-guardsmen convicted of ``crimes againstthe people'' during the Somoza dictatorship that was overthrown bythe Sandinista revolution in 1979. The list includes 1,688imprisoned ex-guardsmen and 244 who are either under house arrest orfree on conditional liberty.   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said ``many former Somocistaguards will go free very soon, maybe tomorrow (Tuesday). TheLegislative Assembly of Nicaragua will decree very shortly theliberty of those former national guardsmen.''   He spoke to reporters Monday in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, wherehe was attending a conference of foreign ministers from LatinAmerican and West European governments.   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Honduran troops fired onthree Nicaraguan border outposts near Teotecancinte, about 112 milesfrom Managua, on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. The ministry saidnothing about casualties.   Honduran officials were not immediately available for comment onthe charges. Such allegations are frequent and usually denied byHonduras.</TEXT></DOC>
