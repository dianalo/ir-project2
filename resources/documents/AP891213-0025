ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   AIDS groups around the country are applaudinga recommendation that the Bush administration stop screeninginternational visitors for the AIDS virus.   ``The HIV policies now enforced by the Immigration andNaturalization Service are hypocritical, racist and homophobic andmust be abolished,'' said Pat Christen, executive director of theSan Francisco AIDS Foundation.   The National Commission on AIDS made public a resolution Tuesdayurging the government to stop asking visitors to the United Statesif they are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),which causes AIDS, and to quit marking the passports of those whoare.   At least 36 national organizations, including the American BarAssociation, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American RedCross and the National Lawyers' Guild endorsed the new immigrationresolution.   Current policies infringe on human rights and dignity ``and theyreinforce a false impression that AIDS and HIV infection are ageneral threat,'' said Dr. June E. Osborn, who chairs thecommission. ``In fact they are sharply restricted in their mode oftransmission.''   ``This policy is discriminatory, it is unjust, it violates basichuman rights, it inflicts unnecessary hardship and embarrassment onan already suffering community,'' said Charles Carman, president ofthe World Federation of Hemophilia.   ``For too long irrationality, rather than public health, hasgoverned in this area,'' said Chai R. Feldblum, legislative counselto the American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS project.   The commission said the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceroutinely questions some U.S. visitors to learn if they areinfected by HIV and that this has already caused severalinternational groups and agencies to boycott important conferencesto be held in the United States next summer.   Unless the restrictions are eased, said several spokesmen forgroups concerned with AIDS, many international participants areexpected to stay away from the 6th International Conference onAIDS, in San Francisco June 20-24, and the 19th InternationalCongress on Hemophilia, scheduled for Washington in August.   The commission called for immediate administrative steps to endquestioning of tourists, students and temporary visitors abouttheir HIV status while applying for visas.   ``This would eliminate the current practice of stoppingtravelers who are carrying AZT, the only licensed anti-HIV drug,and blood products such as clotting factor used by hemophiliacs,''the commission said.   Travel restrictions for people with HIV began two years ago whenSen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., succeeded in adding HIV to a list ofdangerous contagious diseases considered by the Immigration andNaturalization Service. A waiver process was instituted a year agofor professional conferences, business travel and medicalconferences, but a code is placed on the passports of those whoreceive such waivers.   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation forAIDS Research, said in a telephone interview from San Franciscothat the rules should be changed because ``the policy is not goingto serve any significant public health service but the potentialfor discrimination is significant with a code in your passportknown to everybody.''   The resolution called for a comprehensive review by theDepartments of State, Justice and Health and Human Services ofimmigration policies relating to communicable diseases, especiallyHIV infection.</TEXT></DOC>
