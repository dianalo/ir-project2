RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP)PUBLISHING (PUB)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   A federal regulatory proposal last week to impose a fee on certain computer networks threatens to reverse the hard-won progress that the electronic information business has made recently, industry executives and representatives say.    After years of false starts, the electronic information business -- which provides mountains of data in large computers that small-computer users can tap to help run their lives and jobs -- says it is finally capturing a mass market. The proposed fee ultimately would mean higher prices for these services, and industry officials fear the &quot;sticker shock&quot; will have severe consequences for information vendors and operators of commercial computer networks such as US Sprint Communications Co.'s Reston, Va.-based Telenet unit and McDonnell Douglas Corp's Cupertino, Calif.-based Tymnet unit.    Home-computer users and small businesses will end or greatly reduce their online searches for information, executives predict. Universities, already facing criticism for raising tuitions, also might reduce their use of computers to retrieve information. As a result, network operators and vendors of information may cut back on the services they now provide and reduce investments in new services.    The proposed fee &quot;will have a chilling effect on the budding information services industry,&quot; declares Clark Woodford, executive vice president with CompuServe Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based unit of Handamp;R Block Inc. Adds Stephen Case, marketing vice president for Quantum Computer Services Inc., a Vienna, Va., information services concern: &quot;It seems silly at this point to be introducing a charge that would have the effect of potentially killing the market.&quot;    As previously reported, the Federal Communications Commission proposed to charge such companies as Tymnet and Telenet as much as $5 an hour per user to connect their computer-communications networks to local-phone networks. Such companies rent private phone lines, which previously haven't been subject to access charges, and spread the costs among thousands of computer users who tap into databases over the networks. If the proposal is approved, Tymnet and its counterparts would pass along the cost to the database vendors, who in turn would pass them on to home and business customers.    &quot;The initial impact is that usage will go down very quickly after users receive their first new bill,&quot; says Richard tenEyck, telecommunications director for the Boston Computer Society, a large and influential computer-user group.    Quantum's Mr. Case notes that the current low cost of using computer networks is a major factor behind the recent growth in what he calls the &quot;consumer on-line market.&quot; Quantum provides software that allows users of Commodore International Ltd. computers to call up airline schedules, computer games and news. It currently charges customers, who use Tymnet or Telenet to tap into Quantum's databases, about $3.60 an hour. That would increase as much as $5 an hour, he says, adding, &quot;There aren't that many people in the consumer market who could afford those prices; the market would shrink.&quot;    CompuServe's Mr. Woodford said the company now charges $6.25 an hour for communications, data and processing, with average bills for heavy users totaling $20 to $25 a month. He agrees that a $4 to $5 monthly increase would damp customers' use. And if large numbers of customers are priced out of the market, &quot;you'd see some innovative companies hesitate to invest more in the business,&quot; Mr. Woodford predicts.    The Information Industry Association, a major trade group, is particularly concerned about the broader impact. The fee ultimately will lead to a reduction in &quot;the amount of services available and less investment to develop new services,&quot; says Kenneth Allen, a senior vice president for the group.    In a statement, Carl M. Valenti, vice president of information services for New York-based Dow Jones andamp; Co., said the proposal is particularly untimely. &quot;At a time when electronic information services are searching for ways to reduce telecommunications costs that would permit them to offer more attractive services. . ., this proposal could undermine that effort and seriously impede public acceptance.&quot; Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, also sells electronic information services.    Unlike home users, large-business users have alternatives that will enable them to avoid higher costs, industry executives say. They would be encouraged to build direct communications links to the information vendors, thus bypassing the local-telephone companies and avoiding the access charges in the process. Telenet, which in addition to operating a network also builds private networks, likely would see that part of its business grow, says Paolo Guidi, president.    Some information vendors worry that their profits will shrink. &quot;I'm afraid we may actually lose business,&quot; says Farrel Salsbury, vice president of BRS Information Technologies, Latham, N.Y. He notes that 70% of the company's sales are to university libraries. &quot;They are on fixed budgets, which is even worse for us because they are the ones who can't stand this type of increase,&quot; Mr. Salsbury says. </TEXT></DOC>
