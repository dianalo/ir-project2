First Executive Corp. filed forbankruptcy and its two big insurance subsidiaries were seized by statewatchdogs.;   But the regulators' actions were too little, too late. In fact,today some critics charge that the laxity of state regulators, particularly inCalifornia, contributed to the collapse of Executive Life Insurance Co. inCalifornia and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOW INSURER FELL THROUGH CRACKSSYSTEM FAILED IN 1ST EXEC CASE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 10E of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Indeed, four years ago California regulators realized that Carr and hisassociates were overstating Executive Life's financial health and demandedthat the company raise more cash as a cushion against losses. And in New York,officials -- incensed by regulatory violations, fudged financial statementsand evasive answers -- ousted three of the insurance unit's top executives.;  The actions in both states should have raised red flags that would have warnedhundreds of thousands of consumers to steer clear of the Executive Life units,industry experts say. Yet the flags were never hoisted by regulators.;  Instead, despite serious concerns about the company and its businesspractices, state regulators kept many important concerns to themselves.California regulators did not require Executive Life of California, whichoperated in all 50 states, to notify other state regulators that two-thirds ofthe company's net worth had evaporated because of a state audit.;   Sopolicyholders continued to buy policies, annuities and other products from theExecutive Life units. When the insurers ultimately were seized -- making themamong the largest life insurance failures ever -- they had more than 400,000policyholders and $13 billion in assets.;   Democrat John Garamendi, thepolitically ambitious California insurance commissioner, maintains that hisRepublican predecessor made some big mistakes. Policyholders would be farbetter off if Roxani Gillespie, who served as California's insurancecommissioner between July 1986 and last January, seized Executive Life farsooner -- possibly years ago, he said.;   However, other regulators disagree.They maintain that state law didn't give Gillespie the power to seizeExecutive Life or stop it from investing in the junk bonds that eventuallycaused the company to unravel. Gillespie maintains that she paved the roadthat Garamendi eventually took.;   Some maintain that the problem was simplythe system, an inconsistent patchwork of rules and regulations that variesfrom state to state and that remains so secretive that regulators are oftenunaware of actions taken by their peers.;   In 1974, Carr hooked up with FirstExecutive, a troubled West Los Angeles insurance company. By the early 1980s,he was fueling exponential growth at the insurance holding company by sellinga new product called single-premium deferred annuities.;   To sell theseannuities, which promise investors a hefty payment in the future for arelatively small amount today, Carr's companies offered unusually high returnsto investors. And they could, because Carr backed the policies with aninvestment portfolio stuffed with high-risk, high-rate junk bonds thatgenerally yield far higher returns than high-quality bonds.;   In the early1980s, the company posted tremendous gains in profitability and net worth. Itearned high marks from all the big insurance rating firms.;   Of course, eventhen some knew that what Carr was doing was a gamble. He was investingpolicyholder funds in junk bonds -- a largely untested investment vehicle.Worse still, he was buying heavily into private offerings where there waslittle market for the securities other than that made by Michael Milken, theyoung junk bond wizard who worked for the high-flying securities firm DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.;   What was less known was that Carr was already runninginto skirmishes with state regulators who seemed to consistently believe thathe had overstated his company's net worth. On several occasions, ExecutiveLife's net worth -- a key measure of a financial institution's health -- wasoff by tens of millions of dollars, California officials contended.;   In1986, regulators forced the company to slash reported net worth by a whopping$180 million, leaving Executive Life with less than $90 million in the bank.;  Why did investors ignore the regulatory disputes? For the most part, theysimply didn't know about them.;   California's examiners forced Executive Lifeto correct the statements it filed in the state, but they did not require thecompany to amend financial statements filed in any other jurisdiction wherethe company did business.;   By 1987, some of the junk bonds that were backingpolicies at the Executive Life units in California and New York were goinginto default.;   State regulators also started to more closely scrutinizeFirst Executive's insurance subsidiaries.;   New York regulators' 1987 examfound that Executive Life had taken millions of dollars in credits forreinsurance. (Reinsurance is insurance for insurers -- essentially, allowingone company to pass part of its risk to another company. That gives an insurerthe ability to write more business and collect more premiums. The reinsurercollects a fee.) But on investigation, the reinsurance proved to be improperor phony, regulators later said.;   New York slapped a $250,000 fine on thecompany and forced it to boost capital by $151 million.;   The New Yorkregulators also pushed successfully in 1987 for a bill that would limitinsurers' investments in junk bonds to 20 percent of their assets.;   Asimilar bill was also introduced in the California Legislature in 1987, whenExecutive Life had about 45 percent of its assets in junk bonds.Then-Assemblyman Patrick Johnston, a Democrat who had just been appointed tohead the Committee on Insurance and Finance, was its sponsor. Johnston askedGillespie for information and help in drafting the bill.;   Gillespie neverprovided the committee with information or staff support, and she nevertestified on the bill's behalf, Johnston, now a state senator, said in aninterview. Gillespie would not comment. In the end, the bill died inJohnston's committee after receiving support from only four of the committee's20 members. When Executive Life of California failed, more than 65 percent ofits assets were in junk bonds.;   Executive Life of California was allowed togive its New York-based sister company the $151 million it needed to satisfycapital demands of New York regulators. A few years later, the Californiacompany contributed another $50 million to Executive Life of New York, NewYork regulators said.;   California regulators, who were slashing ExecutiveLife's reported net worth by the tens of millions, also wanted the firm toboost capital. The company did so by getting about $175 million in cash and$170 million in IOUs from its parent, First Executive. First Executive raisedthe money by borrowing it from investors. Thanks to the contribution fromFirst Executive, Executive Life of California was able to report $204 millionin net worth at year-end of 1987.;   It turns out, however, that the $170million IOU -- an asset of the insurer -- did not actually get delivered toExecutive Life until February or March of the following year. Californiaregulators have since said they knew that the company essentially falsifiedits year-end financial statements to report that the asset was there when itwasn't. However, they said they thought that this falsification was&quot;insignificant.&quot;;   Insurance rating services also largely ignored this issue-- as well as several others -- maintaining that they were &quot;technicalviolations&quot; that had little impact on the company's financial health.;   By1988, however, Executive Life's finances were so tight that the company knewit had to boost capital or stop writing new business. It attempted anotheraccounting maneuver designed to free up money set aside in loss reserves bytransforming a $700 million pool of junk bonds into so-called collateralizedbond obligations -- an investment-grade security.;   California examiners, wholearned about the bond swap in 1990, decided the transaction was bogus, andthey forced the company to unravel the deal.;   By now, things were reallylooking bleak. The junk bond market fell through the floor after Milken cameunder investigation. And for 1989, First Executive Corp. posted the biggestannual loss in its history thanks to a $1 billion writeoff in the company'squickly souring investment portfolio.;   News of the staggering loss sentpolicyholders into a panic. They swamped Executive Life's headquartersdemanding their funds. Before it was all over, policyholders had withdrawnmore than $3 billion from the teetering giant.;   Regulators went into crisismode. Suddenly state insurance supervisors nationwide were demanding financialinformation from First Executive and its insurers. But for a year, stateofficials simply monitored the situation -- they commissioned studies, waited,watched and worried. All the studies, including three completed by Milliman andamp;Robertson, a prominent actuarial consulting firm, came to the same conclusion:The company could survive, insurance regulators said.;   In 1991, FirstExecutive posted another whopping year-end loss, which spurred a second run.Garamendi seized the firm and froze its assets.;   He recently announced aproposed $3 billion buyout of Executive Life by a French consortium thatshould pay most policyholders 81 cents on the dollar. Guaranty funds areexpected to kick in the difference for those with cash value policies worthless than $100,000. However, those with larger accounts and some ExecutiveLife investors -- specifically those holding municipal bonds backed by theinsurer's guaranteed investment contracts -- stand to lose substantial sums.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,567  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247149,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
