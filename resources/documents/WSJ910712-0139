It is a grey and formal house, somehow presaging therigid and catholically correct life that the Spanish dictatorwould live.   But almost exactly an hour's drive from Ferro delCaudillo, in the undulating uplands of Spain's poorestprovince, only an occasional visitor seeks out thelong-abandoned home where Angel Maria Bautista Castro Arguiz-- Fidel Castro's little-known father -- was born on December8, 1875. His is a typical, rough gray stone &quot;Gallego&quot;peasant's house with dirt floors. It was here that the roughGallego youth, Angel, was haphazardly raised until he went asa &quot;soldier of Spain&quot; to fight the Americanos in theSpanish-American War of 1898.</LP><TEXT>   Why should we pause for a comparison of birthplaces andGallego heritage between the families of the two greatHispanic dictators of the 20th century? Certainly, FidelCastro and Francisco Franco were too immensely different forany such exercise to have validity: Generalissimo FranciscoFranco was the most longevous fascist of the 20th centurywhile Comandante Fidel Castro is the century's consummateThird World Communist.   As a matter of fact, the real story of these two &quot;unlike&quot;men lies on a plane far removed from those supposedideological polar points of the modern world. The strangetruth is that they were mutual admirers. Although they nevermet, they maintained for nearly two decades a relationshipthat can best be described as that of political father andpolitical son.   All along, there had been broad and even rather obvioushints of this odd &quot;caudillo&quot; relationship. When the U.S.placed the American embargo on Cuba, Franco assiduously kepthis Iberia Airlines flying as the only direct air linkbetween Cuba and Western Europe. Trade between the two&quot;unlike&quot; systems boomed in the 1960s and 1970s.   Curious but revealing messages were constantly sent backand forth. In the first year of the Revolution, for instance,the Cuban ambassador to Madrid, Jose Miro Cardona, met withFranco and later reported to friends that the rigid andremote little Spaniard finally asked him, &quot;How is Fideldoing?&quot; Then Franco told the Cuban diplomat, his voice risingto one of its oddly squeaky heights, &quot;Tell Fidel to give hellto the Americans]&quot;   These two classical Spanish caudillos constantly searchedout information on the other from travelers between their twocountries. The famous Spanish journalist Antonio Orlani, anintimate friend of the Franco family, told me once in Madridthat Franco would often ply him with questions about theyoung Fidel, saying &quot;`your friend is very intelligent and agreat strategist,'&quot; and that &quot;Cuba really had needed a changeand that everything Fidel did to bring that about was that ofa good military man.&quot;   Then when Mr. Orlani would travel to Cuba, Fidel in turnwould seek out the well-connected Spaniard and muse with himabout how impressed he was with Franco's thinking during hisown fight in the Sierra Maestra -- and with his support, evenin those early years of 1957 and 1958. &quot;Franco knew the warand the guerrilla perfectly,&quot; Fidel would tell Mr. Orlani,&quot;Franco knew at every moment during the Sierra Maestra wherewe `Fidelistas' were, but he always refused to give anyinformation to the Batista government.&quot;   Apparently no one noticed -- at least in the foreign press-- that when Generalissimo Franco died in 1975, his &quot;goodfriend&quot; Fidel declared an entire week of mourning in Cuba.Also missed were the gifts and compliments the two menconstantly exchanged. But it is downright dangerous that noone paused to ask whether a declared &quot;fascist&quot; or a declared&quot;Communist&quot; in the modern world were really all that farapart. Indeed, one of Franco's retired ambassadors, who knewthe caudillo well, best explained the apparent contradictionsto me one day in Madrid.   &quot;I know a little secret that is little known,&quot; thisgrey-haired and elegant little man told me, &quot;and it will makeour interview worthwhile for you.&quot; He smiled impishly atthis, then went on, saying, &quot;Franco had sympathy for threepeople in contemporary history: Mao Tse-tung, Ho Chi Minh andFidel Castro. Only a few Spanish diplomats know this. It isnot, certainly, because Franco was of the Communist line, butbecause there is a common element in the three.&quot;   At this point, he looked properly devilish in hisrevelations. &quot;All three were great guerrilla fighters. AndFranco was a great admirer of the guerrilla, which of courseis an invention of Spain from the wars against Napoleon. And,of course, Fidel and Franco were both Gallegos.&quot;   What we can now see is that Castro has remainedessentially the same kind of man as Franco and, indeed, thesame kind of man as most of the first generation ofpostcolonial Third World leaders: the sole leader of aone-party state, whether fascist or Communist, and a man withtotal power in his hands alone for as long as he lives.   No wonder the two Gallegos understood each other so well,and no wonder their historic fraternity compells us to thinkin new terms about our age.   ---   Ms. Geyer is a syndicated columnist and author of abiography of Fidel Castro titled &quot;Guerrilla Prince&quot; (LittleBrown).</TEXT></DOC>
