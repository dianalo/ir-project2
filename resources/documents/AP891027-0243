LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A beer price war that's heating up across thenation has turned heads on Wall Street, but the folks who ring upthe six-packs at the cash register aren't impressed.   ``We've seen and heard these kinds of things over and over,''said Don Cowan, a spokesman for the Dallas-based Southland Corp.,which owns 7-Eleven, the nation's largest chain of conveniencestores.   ``I think this is more like standard operating procedure,''Cowan said Thursday.   But the decision by Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the world'slargest brewer, to match price cuts made by competitors in aneffort to shore up some declining markets did attract a great dealof attention from the financial world.   ``It's going to be flat-out war,'' said Julie Neimann, asecurities analyst for St. Louis-based Stifel Nicolaus Co.   ``There has been a beer war in this country for the past 18months, but we've really tried to stay above the fray. Now, we arejoining the fray,'' said Jerry Ritter, a vice president and chieffinancial officer for St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch.   Talk of a beer price war was news to Miller Brewing Co., thenation's second-largest brewer.   ``Our pricing and Anheuser-Busch's have not been significantlydifferent this year,'' Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for theMilwaukee-based company, said Thursday.   The Stroh Brewery Co. ranks third among domestic brewers,followed by Adolph Coors Co. and the G. Heileman Brewing Co. Lastmonth, Coors said it signed an agreement in principle to acquiremost of the beer-related assets of Stroh Brewery.   The new Anheuser-Busch policy is going to mean slightly lowerbeer prices for consumers and fiercer competition for the nation'sbeermakers, according to market analysts.   ``The level of discounting in the beer business has been goingup for some time, but now Anheuser-Busch has said it's coming outwith both guns blazing,'' said Ben Steinman, executive editor ofBeer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication.   It's too early to tell how much Anheuser-Busch's new policy isgoing to push down prices in the premium beer category, but someanalysts estimate consumers will save about a quarter on a six-pack.   Six-packs of Budweiser, Miller Genuine Draft and Coors generallycost about $3.50, although all companies offer frequent sales thatdrop the price below $3 in many areas of the country.   Ritter said Anheuser-Busch decided to match price cuts by Millerand Coors because consumers have been buying Budweiser andMichelob, the two main Anheuser-Busch brands, at a slower rate inthe past few months.   ``Sales had been growing between 3 and 4 percent, but nowthey've slipped to a little below 3 percent. We decided it was timeto turn up the heat,'' said Ritter.   Anheuser-Busch, which has been the country's leading brewer formore than three decades, sells about 42 percent of the beer in theUnited States. It hopes to boost that to 50 percent over the nextseveral years.   The new pricing strategy is certainly going to accelerate thatgrowth, at the expense of the nation's other breweries, said RoyBurry, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in New York.   The American beer industry has become much more competitive inthe 1980s because beer sales have been increasing only slightly andper capita beer consumption has been going down.   The stepped up competition has led to an increase in the numberof brands being sold by breweries and more promotion, advertisingand price cutting, analysts said.   While Anheuser-Busch's new policy will be great for consumers,advertising agencies and convenience stores, analysts say theaggressive stance is going to hurt the rest of the industry, whichhas been struggling.   ``The big question is what's going to happen to Miller,'' Burrysaid.   Miller has been enjoying one of its best sales years ever. Thecompany sold more beer in August than it ever sold in any othermonth, said Steve Forsyth, a Miller spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
