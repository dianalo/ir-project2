Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, chief of staff, said the army has punisheddozens of soldiers for violating orders since the Arab rebellionbegan Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   He did not elaborate, but the army has issued rules on whensoldiers are allowed to fire on or beat protesters.   Shomron also said the violence has lessened the influence ofJordan's King Hussein in the territories, which Israel capturedfrom Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war, and undermined hisusefulness in peace negotiations.   ``The uprising in the territories has weakened Jordan's ...position as a potential partner for negotiations,'' he told foreignreporters. ``We hear voices today that King Hussein is retreatingfrom positions he had taken before the uprising began.''   Soldiers shot a Palestinian youth during a clash with youngArabs hurling rocks and bottles in the Nur Shams refugee camp nearTulkarem in the West Bank, the army said. Officials at RafidiyehHospital in Nablus said he was critically wounded in the chest.   Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded since the rebellion beganamong the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Atleast 195 have been killed, and an Israeli soldier and a Jewishsettler also have been slain.   Indefinite curfews were imposed on the Dheishe refugee camp inthe West Bank and on nine camps and villages in the Gaza Strip.   Underground leaders called the one-day strike in a leafletsigned by the Palestine Liberation Organization to mark the end ofmourning for Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander, 40 daysafter he was assassinated at his home in Tunis.   Wazir, whose code name was Abu Jihad, spent his boyhood in GazaCity. His cousin Ahmed Wazir, who lives there, said soldiers barredmourners from attending a reception in the slain leader's honor.   ``The army is outside our house,'' Ahmed Wazir said by telephonefrom his home, where the reception was to have been held. ``Theyturned back anyone who came here.''   He said 10 army jeeps and other military vehicles were outsidehis house and soldiers with megaphones ordered all residents on hisstreet to remain indoors.   Stores were closed throughout the territories and in Arab eastJerusalem, which Israel took from Jordan in 1967 and has formallyannexed. Public transport was halted and most Palestinians who havejobs in Israel stayed home.   Vendors selling newspapers and doughnut-shaped bread coveredwith sesame seeds, an Arab staple, provided the only signs ofcommercial activity.   Classes were conducted at kindergartens and elementary schoolsin the West Bank, which were allowed to open Monday for the firsttime in nearly four months.   Olivier Rafovicz, spokesman for the military government, saidabout 90 percent of the 200,000 students showed up Wednesday.``This shows the strengthening of the military government,'' hesaid.   In the leaflet that called the strike, however, undergroundleaders said the school re-opening was a victory and urged childrento attend.   Israel radio said the army threatened Arab property owners withup to five years in jail if they failed to wash anti-Israeligraffiti off their buildings and remove Palestinian flags, whichare outlawed by Israel.   Army spokesmen had no immediate comment on the report, whichalso said those who did not comply could be fined 15,000 shekels($9,670).   A Jewish settler was charged with manslaughter Wednesday in thefatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd May 5 near Shiloh, aJewish settlement in the West Bank, Israel radio reported.   It quoted the charge sheet, Yisrael Zeev fired at Arab shepherdsdespite their shouts that they would stop grazing sheep on disputedland near Shiloh, the radio said. One shepherd was killed andanother wounded.   Government prosecutors also charged two editors of the left-wingnewspaper Derech Hanitzotz with membership in a guerrillaorganization and maintaining contacts with a foreign agent, theradio said.   Yaacov Ben Efrat and Assaf Adiv, and two other staff memberscharged earlier this week, face up to 40 years in jail ifconvicted. They are accused of belonging to the Democratic Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction, and meetingwith Arab guerrillas in London.</TEXT></DOC>
