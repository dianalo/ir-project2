The Korean National Council of Churches said the government ofPresident Roh Tae-woo was more undemocratic than that of hisdictatorial predecessor and was ``causing people's lives to collapsewith the suppression of human rights.''   Also today, hundreds of students in Seoul fought with riotpolice, and radical youths attacked a police station and an armyofficer's quarters in two provincial cities. No arrests or injurieswere reported.   Authorities said student protesters had received $30,000 from aKorean group in Japan allegedly controlled by a pro-North Koreanorganization.   The church council, which represents leading protestant clergy ina nation where one-fourth of the population is Christian, has been apolitical force for years. But today's message was its first majorpolitical stand since Roh came to power.   In a statement issued following an all-night prayer meeting at adowntown Anglican church, the council said more than 800 people werearrested as political prisoners in recent months.   ``Movements for independence, democratization and unificationhave been denounced as leftist and pro-communist,'' said thestatement. It said there had been violence, torture and surveillance``threatening the people's rights to survival and causing the peopleto tremble in a sense of crisis.''   Dissidents, radical students, Roman Catholic clergy and somepoliticians have accused the government of stalling on democraticreforms Roh promised before he took office in February 1988.   At Seoul's Joongang University, witnesses said 1,000 radicalstudents battled police with rocks and firebombs to demand thegovernment disband the nation's intelligence apparatus, the Agencyfor National Security Planning.   About 500 students demanding the release of a radical studentjailed for an illegal trip to North Korea hurled firebombs at riotpolice in front of Korea University in Seoul.   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' students yelled. Riot police in combatfatigues drove them back with tear gas.   At Kyonghee University in Seoul, 400 students fought with riotpolice.   The Agency for National Security Planning, formerly the KoreanCentral Intelligence Agency, announced today that the radicalNational Council of Student Representatives received $30,000 foranti-state activities from a pro-communist Korean student alliancein Japan.   The student group sent 20-year-old Im Su-kyong to a youthfestival in communist North Korea in defiance of a South Koreangovernment ban on unauthorized travel to the north. She was jailedupon her return on charges of violating national security laws.   The South Korean security agency claimed that the group in Japan,the Korean Student Alliance, is under control of the pro-NorthKorean Chosoren organization, also in Japan.   The agency said the alliance delivered the money in August 1988to the student council's chairman, Oh Yong-shik, who also is jailedon charges of national security violations.</TEXT></DOC>
