The caves Mao called home in Yenan's arid mountains arepreserved much as he left them, the spartan desks and bedstandsstill in place.   Since then, Yenan's population has grown from 10,000 to 80,000,and a smattering of eight- and 10-story concrete apartment blocksgive the town an urban air. But the lives of most of its residentshave changed little compared with the rest of China.   Two-thirds of Yenan's people still live in caves in the steepbrown cliffs overlooking two narrow rivers that meet at Yenan.   The cave-dwellers fetch water from nearby wells and grind theirgrain using old-style millstones turned by donkey or by hand. Theycook on coal stoves that also heat the family sleeping platform,the kang.   The caves have electricity, but few people have major electricalappliances.   The average annual per capita income of Yenan's peasants is $59_ less than half the national average and barely above the officialpoverty level of $54. Non-peasants average $108 a year, comparedwith a national figure of $248.   The Communist revolution was intended to free the peasants fromthe whims of nature and those in power. But in Yenan, nature hasbeen stingy and those in power are far away.   ``We rely on heaven for food,'' said Lei Zhifu, a formerguerrilla leader and retired Communist Party official, quoting anancient saying about China's dependence on nature.   Mao, who arrived here in 1937 at the end of the Long March, a6,000-mile retreat from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, leftYenan in 1947 as the country's civil war raged. He never returned.   Premier Chou En-lai returned briefly in 1973, to attend theopening of a revolutionary museum. He ordered that small factoriesbe set up with central government help to supplement theperennially drought-stricken area's meager agricultural income.   The factories were built: fertilizer, steel, cement and textilesamong others. But nothing was done to ensure that their productsreached markets.   Only one narrow, twisting road and three weekly flights linkYenan to the outside world. The nearest big city, Xian, is morethan 185 miles to the south, an eight-hour trip by car.   Since 1985, Beijing has moved to end Yenan's isolation byproviding more than $54 million toward construction of a railroad.Tracks have been laid nearly halfway from Xian to Yenan, and plansare to finish by 1990.   There's a snag _ $43 million more is needed to build the finalstretch. Li Guanhua, deputy director of Yenan's planningcommission, said he expected Beijing to provide at least part.   Even with a railroad, Li's plans for Yenan's future are modest.He envisioned gradual growth fueled by wider sales for the town'sfactories, especially its leading industry, cigarettes.   Lu Derong, the cigarette factory's deputy director, said they'lldouble production to 64 million packs a year once the railroad isfinished.   The workers earn an average of $405 a year, making them the bestpaid in town.   But the railroad is unlikely to help the 200-employee matchfactory next door, already hard hit by competition from larger,mechanized factories elsewhere.   It shut down for 10 months last year because it had no money tobuy wood for matches. Yenan officials finally loaned it $27,000 _enough to reopen but not to buy modern machinery that would make itcompetitive.   Elsewhere in China, state-owned factories that lose money arebeing closed or leased to entrepreneurs under top leader DengXiaoping's decade-old program to stimulate the economy and reducecentral controls.   But Li said ``no one in Yenan has enough money'' to lease thematch factory. And it can't be shut, officials said, because theworkers need the jobs.   Yenan's agriculture also needs massive investment, in the formof irrigation canals, to significantly raise production. With lessthan 16 inches of rain annually, yields are less than half those inChina's lush southeast.   No efforts are made to encourage the one industry for whichYenan is historically equipped: tourism. More than 50 hotels areunder construction in Xian alone as part of a nationwide tourismboom, but Yenan offers only five small guest houses.   Xian, site of the ancient city of Chang-an, is known for itstemples and tombs. Its biggest attraction is the thousands oflife-size terra cotta warriors built more than 2,000 years ago toguard the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who united China.   Of the 80,000 visitors to Mao's old headquarters every year,only about 500 are foreigners, who bring far more money thanChinese.   Yenan's dust-covered streets are uninviting and things aresleepy.   Even a confirmed Marxist like Lei Zhifu said he attendsceremonies at the local Buddhist temple ``for excitement.''</TEXT></DOC>
