Representatives of the 39 signatory nations of the AntarcticaTreaty of 1959 said Friday discussion of ``comprehensiveenvironmental measures'' would be continued next year.   The Paris meeting was the latest installment of an unfoldingdrama about the future of a frozen continent larger than the UnitedStates and Mexico combined.   A member of Belgium's delegation predicted privately that,before the 1990 meeting, public opinion will create pressure forstringent protection.   ``This is a big day for the environment,'' said Jim Barnes,director of the Antarctic and Southern Oceans Coalition, anumbrella for about 200 environmental groups. Although mostsubstantive matters were postponed, Barnes said just focusing worldattention on Antartica was significant.   ``There is momentum ... that is leading to Antarctica beingdeclared a special place unlike any other on earth,'' Barnes said.   No time or place was immediately announced for next year'smeeting.   The United States, Britain and New Zealand support aninternational minerals convention that would open Antarctica toregulated mining. They sought to exclude discussion of the naturereserve from the 1990 discusssions.   ``We were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted theoutcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position,'' saidTucker Scully, head of the U.S. delegation.   A mining convention worked out over six years of negotiationswas signed in June 1988 in Wellington, New Zealand. Washingtonwants a meeting next year to discuss the convention, which it sayssets stringent standards and offers the most practical way ofsafeguarding the Antarctic environment.   The convention does not assign liability for accidents such asoil spills. Two fuel leaks at U.S. bases in Antarctica have beenannounced this month.   Australia and France want to declare Antarctica a ``wildernesspark'' where mining would be prohibited and human activitycarefully controlled. They were joined recently by Italy, Belgium,India, Greece, Austria and Bulgaria.   The U.S. delegation has agreed to a separate meeting on themining convention. Barnes, the environmentalist representative,called the planned talks ``victory for common sense.''   Delegates to the Paris conference agreed on minor issues,adopting a waste disposal code and extending international marinepollution conventions to include the seas around Antarctica. Theyalso created a category of areas to be given special protectionbecause they are wild, beautiful or geologically important.   The 1959 treaty set aside all territorial claims to Antarcticaand declared it a region of peace and scientific cooperation.</TEXT></DOC>
