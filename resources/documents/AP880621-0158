Gen. HenriNamphy back to power after four months of civilian rule and endedhopes for democracy.   Leslie Manigat, the civilian president ousted by Namphy onMonday, today called the new government ``very fragile'' and blamedthe coup on corruption in the military. He spoke from exile in theDominican Republic.   Some telephone service was restored in Port-au-Prince afterbeing cut Monday. The streets filled with cars and people in themorning after being nearly deserted the previous morning.   Scattered gunfire was heard in the streets overnight and intothe dawn, but there were no signs of factional fighting. Soldiershave often fired their weapons into the air to frighten civiliansfrom the street since the coup.   Manigat told reporters in Santo Domingo that he learned of thecoup as he sat at home watching television Monday night. Manigatsaid he still didn't know what role Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who hadbeen his main military ally, was playing.   Paul was at Namphy's side Monday when Namphy announced his newgovernment on national television.   ``Namphy always acted on his own,'' Manigat said, but he addedthat he always had faith in Paul as a loyal military man.   It was Paul whom Namphy tried to fire last week as commander ofthe powerful 700-man Dessalines Batallion. Manigat reversedNamphy's transfer of Paul and of several other officers and firedNamphy for insubordination.   After Monday's takeover, Namphy reappointed Paul commander ofthe battalion.   Manigat said he has talked to foreign governments andinternational organizations asking them to reject the Namphygovernment. He said he hasn't decided where his place of exile willbe. He said he would travel this month to Europe for meetings withpolitical leaders to rally support against the new government.   Manigat said he wasn't told where he was being sent until helanded in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island ofHispaniola with Haiti.   Namphy reestablished military rule by decree and named his owngovernment just hours after rallying troops who seized the nationalpalace and quickly ousted Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government.   On Monday, some citizens and officials predicted a bleak futurefor the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.   Most businesses and schools in this capital of 1 million peoplewere closed. There were no reported protests in this arid,mountainous country of 6 million people.   ``This means the end of democracy. We are going to have to liveunder a military dictatorship,'' a bus driver said hours afterNamphy expelled Manigat.   ``The army has taken power. This is a government of murderersand machetes,'' said a former Haitian diplomat, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The coup dashed hopes for democracy promised by Namphy afterpopular unrest toppled the Duvalier family's 29-year dictatorship.   The general had led the three-man junta that ruled Haiti afterJean-Claude Duvalier fled exile in 1986. The junta stepped asideafter Manigat was elected Jan. 17 in fraud-riddled balloting run bythe military and boycotted by most Haitians.   After the rift last week over Namphy's transfer of militaryofficers, Manigat placed Namphy under house arrest.   But loyal soldiers freed Namphy on Sunday and, after brief gunand grenade battles, Haiti's 7,000-man army united solidly behindthe 55-year-old career soldier. It was not known if there werecasualties in the fighting.   Neither the Haitian public nor democratic-minded politicianspublicly expressed support for Manigat's government.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said:``The United States government strongly condemns this serious blowto hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''   She noted that Paul was indicted on federal drug-traffickingcharges in Miami last March.   Namphy announced on national television that he had formed amilitary government, named himself president, appointed a 12-memberCabinet that included only one civilian, and dissolved the NationalAssembly.   He said he would rule by decree.   He told Haitians that Manigat ``betrayed your confidence andviolated the constitution he swore to uphold.''   ``The future of democracy was at stake,'' the general said asthe commanders of every unit in Haiti's armed forces watched. ``Thearmy must protect the superior interests of the country and musthead the country. To this end, a military government has beenformed.''</TEXT></DOC>
