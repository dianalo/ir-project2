The utility holding company said that it would pay about two-thirds of the facility's $579 million cost if federal and state energy agencies would pay the rest, adding that it will apply today for federal funding.    The AEP announcement is the latest move by the coal and electric-utility industries to head off acid-rain legislation currently working its way through Congress.    W.S. White Jr., AEP's chairman, reiterated the industries' position that clean-coal technology &quot;has the potential for making the nation's coal supply usable in an environmentally acceptable manner,&quot; but that the new technology may die if companies are forced by Congress to pay for &quot;outdated scrubber technology.&quot;    AEP said that it would modify a conventional coal-fired power plant, using so-called pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology. The modified plant would have a capacity of 330,000 kilowatts. If funding is lined up, AEP said, the plant would begin operating in 1995. </TEXT></DOC>
