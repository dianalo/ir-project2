The decision, overturning a National Labor Relations Boardruling, involved Colorado-Ute Electric Association, anelectrical cooperative. The ruling could pave the way foremployers to carry out wage, working hours or other laborplans when bargaining with unions fails, but such actionscould run into trouble if other courts don't follow suit. TheDenver ruling differed from a decision by a U.S. appealscourt in Washington a year ago, in a case involving ToledoBlade Co.</LP><TEXT>   The Toledo Blade decision held that an employer can'toffer workers early-retirement packages without permission oftheir union. But the Denver court said the Toledo Blade caseinvolved the employer's insistence on negotiating directlywith workers, while in the Colorado-Ute case, the employerwanted to carry out a merit-raise plan after bargaining withits union failed.   The decision by the three-member appeals court in Denvercould have considerably broader impact than the Toledo Bladeruling. The NLRB had said that Colorado-Ute lawfullybargained to an impasse with the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers over the co-op's right to offer meritraises directly to employees. But the NLRB also ruled thatthe co-op illegally tried to put the plan into effect withoutnegotiating with the IBEW over the amount and timing of themerit raises.   &quot;This decision is far more important to employersgenerally&quot; than the Toledo Blade ruling, because mostemployers these days try to carry out pay-raise plans whenthey can't get unions to agree to them, Gerard Smetana, theattorney who argued the case for Colorado-Ute, said in aninterview. He called merit raises &quot;the key to success inobtaining productivity.&quot; Ironically, the Toledo Bladedecision also reversed the NLRB, which had ruled in favor ofthe newspaper.   Jerry Hunter, the NLRB's general counsel, agreed in aninterview that this is &quot;a much bigger case&quot; than ToledoBlade. &quot;It could be and has been a recurring issue&quot; at theboard, which has several pending cases involving such mattersas employers attempting to subcontract work without unionacquiescence, trying to carry out plans for merit raises, orseeking to block union bids for membership on committees thatdecide such raises, Mr. Hunter said.   The Colorado-Ute decision leaves the board &quot;up in theair,&quot; said Mr. Hunter. Whether it will appeal the court'sruling is under review, he added.   The court said the NLRB's attempt to give the union a vetoover terms of the merit raise &quot;eviscerated Colorado-Ute'sright to implement at impasse, one of its powerful economictools.&quot; The IBEW's Local 111 at Montrose, Colo., demanded a9% wage boost, but the employer pushed for merit increases,with management to decide the frequency and amount of thoseraises.   When Colorado-Ute finally said the two sides had reachedimpasse and that the company would carry out its final offer,the union struck. Because the employer isn't compelled toagree to the union's wage terms, &quot;the union does not enjoy aunilateral veto over wage terms and the employer may try toachieve the wage terms it desires by using its economicweapon of implementing at impasse,&quot; said Judge StephanieSeymour, in the unanimous opinion.</TEXT></DOC>
