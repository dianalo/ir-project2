Jean Guiffre sees it in vegetable prices. The owner of Top Banana Shopping Service in Brandywine, Md., she now pays 70 or 80 cents for produce that two years ago sold for 50 cents.    Jim Griebenow, too, knows it's happening. A vice president of Marshall Field's in Chicago, he says the new line of Anne Klein sportswear costs 25% more at retail than last year. &quot;There's a great deal of pressure on pricing,&quot; he says.    And Ed Purdie feels it intensely. A purchasing manager at McKee Baking Co. in Collegedale, Tenn., he buys boxes to ship Little Debbie cakes and pies throughout the country. In just 20 months, he has watched box prices jump by 50%. &quot;In the past, corrugated cardboard has been a pretty good barometer for the entire economy,&quot; Mr. Purdie contends.    The changes are spotty and gradual, and no one is yet predicting a return to the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s. But for six years, consumer inflation -- excluding volatile oil-prices -- has hovered around 4%. Now, according to various indicators, it is moving upward.    &quot;It's clearly going up; we are seeing a lot of price movements,&quot; says Donald Ratajczak, the director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;Inflation is in the process of accelerating,&quot; agrees Joel Popkin, an economic consultant in Washington, D.C. &quot;It isn't a big movement, but by the end of the year we'll be running at a 5% rate.&quot; There are signs that wage increases may be beginning to grow as well, which would reinforce the rise.    The nascent trend poses a tough challenge for the Federal Reserve, which attempts to maintain price stability by influencing interest rates. Fed officials are eager to act quickly to prevent excessive price rises. They learned during the 1970s that if they wait too long to combat inflation, it becomes embedded in the economy.    But the Fed is also under intense political pressure to avoid raising interest rates before the November presidential election. All six Fed governors were appointed by President Reagan, and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has a long history of involvement with the Republican Party. Fed officials also worry that sharply higher interest rates could damage still-weak segments of the economy and exacerbate problems among troubled banks and thrift institutions.    &quot;It's a tough call for the Fed,&quot; says Mr. Ratajczak.    Signs of emerging inflation were apparent in a recent report on consumer prices, which showed price increases running at a 6.4% seasonally adjusted annual rate during March. A more recent survey reported that 70% of corporate purchasing managers face price increases, while only 1% cite price decreases. That's the biggest spread since March 1980, according to the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which conducted the survey.    Certain prices have risen at a brisk pace throughout this decade. Health-care inflation, for instance, hasn't dropped below 6% annually, and the cost of education has risen even faster. But until recently, inflation in health, education and other services was offset by flat or falling prices for many manufactured goods and farm commodities. The decline in the dollar and the continued strength in the economy, however, are now adding demand and causing those prices to rise, too.    Clothing prices, for instance, jumped more than 2% in March. And the purchasing managers report steadily rising prices for paper products, chemicals, plastics, steel and aluminum. &quot;The pervasive nature of the increases,&quot; says economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co., &quot;suggests something more fundamental&quot; is now going on.    A new report on economic conditions in the 12 Federal Reserve districts also demonstrates the inflation pressures in some regions. Manufacturers around Chicago, for instance, say they're facing widespread price increases for materials. And the San Francisco Fed cites sharp price rises for some products, such as copper, wheat, logs, and wool.    Whether such price increases will lead to a persistent rise in inflation depends on wages, most economists say. And at the moment, wage increases remain surprisingly small. The average hourly earnings of American workers rose just 3.1% during the 12 months ended March 31 -- not even enough to keep up with 3.9% inflation. &quot;If you don't see wage rates moving up, it's hard to imagine any worsening of inflation,&quot; says Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor.    But with unemployment at its lowest level in nearly a decade, wage pressures are also starting to build. Nineteen states now have jobless rates of 5% or less. &quot;That's a big chunk of our economy already at full employment,&quot; says Mr. Sinai. As a result, &quot;wage inflation is starting to accelerate.&quot;    In states such as Massachusetts, which has an unemployment rate of only 2.9%, the trend has long been apparent. &quot;The labor market here is almost critical,&quot; says Bernard Cullen, personnel director for Brigham's ice cream stores in the Boston area. He has to pay as much as $10 an hour to attract short-order cooks and counter help. That's nearly twice what he was paying two years ago.    To try to deal with the seasonal demand this summer, Mr. Cullen has written a student organization in Dublin, Ireland, to lure temporary workers to the U.S. &quot;There are just not enough people here to cover the jobs,&quot; he says.    Even in states with higher unemployment, pressures are intense. In Dalton, Ga., carpet mills compete fiercely among themselves to attract scarce workers. &quot;It's not only difficult to hire people, it's difficult to keep those you've got,&quot; says Kenneth Beaudoin, the director of personnel at World Carpets Inc. &quot;We have people who drive here from Kentucky.&quot;    Other employers are forced to join in the competition, too, increasing wages to keep employees. &quot;I'm having the hardest time getting people to work for me,&quot; says Marvin Smith, who recently opened a pizza delivery operation in Dalton. &quot;It took me three weeks to hire eight people, and I need 20.&quot;    Mr. Smith also has problems at his other stores in the area. As a result, in November he raised pay rates to $3.50 an hour from $3.40; he plans to increase that again this month, to $3.65.    The pickup is starting to show in national figures. A recent report from the Labor Department said that total compensation for all workers in private industry rose a strong 1.5% in the first quarter and was 3.9% above the total a year earlier. Much of that increase reflected a rise in the Social Security payroll tax that employers pay; but it nevertheless marked the first time in eight years that first-quarter compensation was higher than it had been the previous year.    Says the consultant, Mr. Popkin: &quot;Once inflation gets built into wages, it is much more difficult to {deal with through the use of} monetary policy.&quot;    Also adding to inflation fears is the rising factory operating rate. As factories approach full capacity, economists say, they are more likely to push for price increases.    At the moment, the operating rate for all industries remains at 82.3%, still below the danger point. &quot;You don't worry about general inflation until the factory operating rate gets above 85%,&quot; says Michael Penzer, a senior economist at Bank of America.    Nevertheless, in many industries the operating rate is already well over that point, and in others it is getting close. Textiles, paper, chemicals, rubber, plastics and aerospace factories all are operating at 86% of their capacity or more. &quot;There is a pattern out there that looks very similar to early 1973,&quot; says Mr. Ratajczak. &quot;The overall economy wasn't in full utilization, but a half dozen industries were.&quot; A year later, 1974, when the nation was in the grip of the oil crisis, inflation first broke into double digits.    But despite rising price pressures, most economists agree that the chance of runaway inflation is small. American consumers and businesses both remain reluctant to accept price increases.    Mr. Griebenow of Marshall Field's, for instance, admits that he may soon have to discount prices on his Anne Klein sportswear in order to persuade consumers to buy it. Rosalind Wells, the chief economist of the National Retail Merchants Association, says other retailers will have to mark down prices. &quot;I don't think a lot of these apparel prices will stick,&quot; she says. &quot;There's not enough strength out there. Consumers will buy, but only if you give them a good reason, a good price.&quot;    Mr. Ratajczak also sees strong resistance to many price increases. &quot;What you are getting is not a spiral,&quot; as was true in the 1970s, he says. &quot;Instead, the cost pressures come in, prices kick up, but the customers keep beating them back.&quot;    The report from the regional Fed banks says many retailers are already making &quot;aggressive markdowns&quot; on prices to get consumers to buy their goods.    A drop in oil prices could also provide some price relief, as it did in 1986. The recent failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach an agreement limiting production suggests prices might fall some. But any dip in inflation associated with oil prices is likely to be temporary.    Underscoring the current worries about inflation is the fact that consumer demand continues to run strong. Many economists expected last October's stock market crash to damp growth in consumer spending. It did for a couple of months, but spending has now snapped back.    That causes particular concern at the Federal Reserve. Chairman Greenspan made it clear in written answers to congressional questions this week that he believes domestic spending must be kept at a &quot;restrained pace&quot; in order to allow room for export demand to rise without heating up inflation. Improvement in the trade deficit, he said, places a &quot;burden on monetary policy to curtail private domestic spending.&quot;    Ideally, Fed officials would like to see Congress and the administration cool down the economy by taking action to cut government deficit-spending. But the president and Congress have called an election-year truce on deficit-cutting action, leaving the Fed to act alone.    As a result, the strong pace of domestic spending could increase pressure on Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues to push interest rates higher and slow the economy. Failure to do so, says Bear Stearns economist Lawrence Kudlow, &quot;will raise questions about the Fed's election-year resolve.&quot;    ---                     Inflation Components    Seasonally adjusted compound annual rate of increase for consumer prices, first three months of 1988, in percent    All items                                    4.2%    All items less energy                        4.8%    Medical care                                 7.7%    Apparel and upkeep                           7.3%    Entertainment                                5.6%    Housing                                      4.6%    Food and beverages                           2.1%    Transportation                              -0.7%    Education, personal care and other          10.7%    Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
