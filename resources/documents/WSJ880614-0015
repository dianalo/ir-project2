Many markets reported that activity slowed as traders await Tuesday's release of U.S. April trade data.    Tokyo share prices rebounded late in the day on buying in electrical manufacturing shares to close above the 28000 level in moderately active trading.    The Nikkei index rose 116.18 points to 28036.54. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 9.11 to 2209.03. First section volume was estimated at a relatively moderate 900 million shares, down from a very heavy 2.2 billion shares Friday. In early trading Tuesday, the Nikkei index was slightly higher at 28064.11, up 27.57 points.    Ichiro Sasaki, manager of international investment information at Yamaichi Securities Co., noted Monday's advance on the Nikkei was partly fueled by moderate buying in selected steel issues as well as major electrical makers indirectly tied to Japanese defense spending.    &quot;Military electronics speculation has been building in the face of the upcoming Toronto summit,&quot; he said, referring to rumors Japan may agree to shoulder a larger defense burden, leading to a rise in military procurements.    One broker for a large foreign securities firm stressed that the dollar's relatively firm dealings also encouraged buying in export-led issues, including electrical manufacturers. Despite the nearness of the U.S. trade release, moreover, most observers reported an absence of scare rumors because of previous reports of improved Japanese trade numbers.    In smaller steel issues, which drew attention as laggards, Kobe Steel edged up 2 yen to 474 ($3.80). Nisshin Steel rose 3 to 848. Larger issues, however, tended to be lower on profit-taking following strong gains last week. Nippon Steel fell 5 to 515, and NKK was off 6 to 512.    In electrical makers, Sony sprinted ahead 20 to 5,140. Advantest, a Fujitsu-affiliated instruments producer, surged 80 to 6,550. Anritsu, a communications instrument manufacturer, soared 100 to 2,600.    London share prices finished lower as the market came down with a bout of jitters ahead of the U.S. trade data.    The Financial Times 30-share index finished 7.1 points lower at 1461.1. Trading volume was a slight 316.2 million shares, compared with Friday's 497.6 million shares. The 100-share index was down 11.0 points at 1838.8.    Analysts said activity was thin as players took to the sidelines ahead of the trade figures. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a slight widening of the trade balance to $12.2 billion from the revised $11.95 billion in March.    Several dealers said there were mounting fears that the U.S. trade balance will show a significant widening. The nervousness over the trade figures is &quot;being transmitted through Wall Street and straight onto our screens,&quot; said one equity dealer, adding that since the market is approaching its intrayear high of 1855.5, &quot;People don't want to pile in without knowing for certain if we're going to surpass the high.&quot;    In addition, analysts said the spate of economic indicators expected this week, both from the U.S. and U.K., was keeping players cautious.    The lack of decisive news from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna and lower gold prices pressured oil and mining stocks lower, analysts said. U.K. independent oil issues were also hurt by a lack of concrete bids emerging from recent takeover talk in the sector.    British Petroleum was off 3 pence at 267 ($4.85), while Shell Transport andamp; Trading fell back 6 to #10.68. Enterprise Oil was off 16 to 452, London andamp; Scottish Marine Oil slipped 16 to 454, and Ultramar eased 11 pence to 296.    Consolidated Gold Fields slumped 20 pence to #10.58 on volume of 380,000 shares after having been off as much as 30 pence at midday. Analysts said market players were taking profits in Consolidated Gold after the sharp run-up in share prices in the past two weeks. RTZ, a mining conglomerate, managed to finish up 3 pence to 423 as 1.8 million shares changed hands.    Frankfurt share prices ended slightly firmer in moderate trading, constrained by the market's indecision ahead of the U.S. trade data.    Brokers said the pending trade report is likely to indicate the near-term trend for the dollar and is seen affecting investment decisions of the domestic and foreign market participants.    Brokers also said suspension of Feldmuehle Nobel stock from trading added confusion to the daily operations and sent a number of participants to the sidelines to watch the developments.    Trading of Feldmuehle shares was suspended in the morning ahead of an expected offer by the Flick nephews for half of the company at 350 marks ($203) a share. But in the early afternoon, the Flicks announced they were canceling the planned bid because of a sharp rise in the stock price.    Feldmuehle stock was indicated at around 325 marks in an unofficial trade Monday morning, sharply above its Friday close of 303.5.    Among chemicals, Bayer shares picked up 0.8 mark to 287.5, BASF was up 1 to 259.5, and Hoechst rose 2.2 to 266.4. Schering fell 2 to 518.    Machinery makers were mostly lower. Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz was down 1.2 to 125.8, while Linde fell 1 to 682.    Elsewhere, shares ended lower in Paris and Stockholm, were mixed in Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan and closed higher in Zurich.    Paris shares closed lower over a broad front, although some late buying eroded earlier losses. Market analysts said that the effect of Sunday's election results, in which the Socialists failed to win a parliamentary majority, was the principal factor for the weaker showing, as participants were uncertain about the current political climate. Furthermore, the scandal relating to the loss of 500 million French francs ($86 million) by the Societe des Bourses Francaises, which oversees the stock exchange, has left a bad impression on investors, observers said.    Stocks closed higher in Taipei and Seoul, were mixed in Wellington and lower in Singapore and Manila. Markets in Hong Kong and Sydney were closed.
