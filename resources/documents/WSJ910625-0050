The size of the charge, which included what thetransportation company described as a &quot;drastic&quot; increase inpersonal-injury lawsuits and projected environmental costs,took many analysts by surprise. Also unexpected wasBurlington's projections of break-even second-quarter resultsbefore the charge was taken into account.</LP><TEXT>   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,Burlington shares were quoted at $28.875 a share, down $3.   Burlington Northern attributed a major portion of itswrite-off to personal-injury litigation related tohearing-loss claims filed by railroad workers. Although thecompany declined to provide details on cost or the number ofclaims, both union spokesmen and officials at other railroadcompanies confirmed that the industry has been facing massivecosts as a result of similar claims for some time.   Joel Price, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp., estimated that 64% of the charge resultsfrom personal-injury settlement costs, with the balancedivided between the environmental costs and crew size andother staffing reductions. Other railroads, he said, tooksimilar charges some time ago.   The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, based inCleveland, said its latest available figures showed that in1989 the railroad industry had 21,000 hearing-loss claims andlawsuits filed, with payments that year totaling $46.5million.   Spokesman at two other transportation companies said theyhad made provisions in previous years for similar claims. CSXCorp. said it took a $600 million write-off in 1989 forpersonal injury and other costs; Norfolk Southern Corp. saidit took a $95 million charge for personal-injury claims in1987.   Burlington also said its second-quarter results wouldreflect the continuing recession, which would result insecond-quarter revenue &quot;well below&quot; last year's levels.   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it put $1.7 billion ofBurlington debt and other securities on its CreditWatch withnegative implications. Sandamp;P said the charge boostsBurlington's already relatively high debt levels and notedits reserves for personal-injury claims and environmentalcleanup costs would entail future cash outlays.   Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed its Burlingtonratings but said it is verifying the adequacy of otherrailroads' reserves for environmental and personal-injuryclaims. Burlington's plans to reduce crew size and managementranks &quot;will enhance longer-term operating efficiency,&quot; itsaid, while the payouts for the personal-injury claims&quot;generally stretch out for several years, thus mitigating theeffect on annual cash flow.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          CSX Corp. said it took a $738 million charge in 1988 forlabor buy-outs and other costs, including $60 million inpersonal injury claims.
