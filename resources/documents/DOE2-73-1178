<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-1178 </DOCNO><TEXT>The second edition of UDI's directory of more than 1500 cogeneration,small power, and industrial power projects in the United States. TheDirectory covers refuse-to-energy plants, gas turbine and combined cyclefacilities, geothermal units, coal- and wood-fired plants, wind and solarinstallations, and a variety of other types of projects throughout theUnited States. While the report focuses on plants designed and constructedto provide at least some electrical output for utility sales, there aremany facilities listed that are not designed for electrical output, butrather represent self-generation, or the provision of steam for districtheating, process work of other heating/cooling applications. This displacementof traditional load for electric and gas utilities is a potentially importantfeature of the burgeoning market for such facilities. The Directory providesa level of project detail sufficient to draw a variety of conclusionsabout this highly publicized emerging sector of the electric power industry.However, the UDI Directory is not designed to be a complete listing ofall facilities that have filed for PURPA status. Features include capitalcost data (available for several hundred projects); listings of the variousorganizations involved in the operation, use, funding, and design ofthese plants; information on the suppliers of the major equipment andservices involved; and location by NERC region, state, county, and town(where available). The report should proved useful to any organizationinvolved in the generation of electric power, process steam, and heatfor industrial or consumer use---including electric utilities, independentpower producers, vendors and suppliers, natural resource companies, financialhouses, fuel suppliers, transportation firms, and others.</TEXT></DOC>
