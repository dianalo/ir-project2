As a result, in order to obtain any recoveryfrom such a borrower, a thrift may have to renegotiate the terms of theloan. In some instances, this renegotiation may result in the thrift'saccepting terms it normally would not accept for similar loans with similarrisks. These may include a lower interest rate or even no interest, a reductionin principal, a lengthier term to maturity, a transfer of assets from theborrower, the substitution or addition of a new borrower, or some combinationof these terms. This renegotiation is known as troubled debt restructuring.FASB-15 defines TDR as a situation in which a ``creditor for economic orlegal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties grants a concessionto the debtor which it would not otherwise consider.'' In the past, the Bank Board has permitted institutions to use TDR. <T3>See </T3>Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Capital Forbearance Policy ForInsured Institutions, 52 FR 6876 (March 5, 1987). In the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552, Congressinstructed the Bank Board to allow an institution that used TDR in accordancewith FASB-15 for any of its loans to account for those loans in accordancewith FASB-5 and FASB-15. CEBA, secs. 402(a), (b). FASB-5 discusses losscontingencies and sets forth guidance concerning the point at which a lossmust be recognized because an asset has been impaired or a liability hasbeen incurred. FASB-15 governs the accounting treatment of a TDR. UsingTDR, an institution may be able to restructure its loan portfolio to maximizeits possible recovery on troubled loans. On October 5, 1987, the Bank Board adopted and published for public noticeand comment a proposed rule and statement of policy on ``Accounting forTroubled Debt Restructuring'' to be codified as 12 CFR 563.23-4 and 12CFR 571.18, respectively. Board Res. No. 87-1046, 52 FR 39112 (Oct. 20,1987). The proposed rule reaffirmed that the Bank Board permits institutionsto use TDR in order to maximize their possible recovery on troubled loansand to account for those transactions in accordance with FASB-5 and FASB-15.The accompanying proposed statement of policy further clarified what constitutesa TDR and when, how, and where a TDR should be reported. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments </ITAG>The Board received a total of twenty-six written comments on its proposedrule and policy statement on troubled debt restructuring. Several of thesecommenters also discussed the issue at the Board's public hearings,\1\<NOTE/> as did other participants at those hearings. Written commentswere received from fourteen thrift institutions, ten trade associations,the staff of the FASB, and one law firm. The commenters generally supportedthe Board's efforts to increase awareness that thrift institutions canuse troubled debt restructuring. Two commenters suggested, however, thatthe Board delay any action on TDR pending FASB resolution of ambiguitiesin the interaction of FASB-5 and FASB-15 and the establishment of a uniformmethod of determining net realizable value (``NRV'') of assets. One commentersupporting the proposal urged that the Board specify that FASB-15 takesprecedence over FASB-5 in accounting for restructured loans. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Board's TDR proposals were part of a package of proposalsissued in accordance with the CEBA. When it adopted these proposals, theBoard announced its intention to hold public hearings on the issues theproposals raised. <T3>See </T3>52 FR 39154 (Oct. 20, 1987). These hearings were held on November3 and 4, 1987.Bank/Thrift GAAP Commenters discussed several specific issues raised by troubled debt restructuring.First, the Board requested comments on whether thrift institutions shouldbe able to account for TDRs on unaudited financial statements and monthlyand quarterly reports to the Board using generally accepted accountingprinciples as set forth in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(``AICPA'') Industry Guide for Banks (``Bank GAAP''). The proposal notedthat, in contrast to the general accepted accounting principles set forthin the AICPA Industry Guide for Savings and Loan Associations (``ThriftGAAP''), Bank GAAP does not require consideration of an institution's costof capital (debt and equity) as a holding cost in determining an asset'snet realizable value. The Board noted that the portion of the CEBA thatinstructs the Board to allow thrift institutions to use TDRs in accordancewith FASB-5 and 15 does not address this discrepancy although the statutesoverall intent was to provide for similar treatment of thrifts and banks.The Board further noted, however, that regardless of what the Board requiredin unaudited financial statements and reports to the Board, auditors preparinga thrift's annual audited financial statements would use Thrift GAAP incalculating an asset's net realizable value. Seventeen commenters addressed this issue. Regardless of their positionon Bank GAAP or Thrift GAAP, all viewed uniform treatment of banks andthrifts as a desirable goal and urged the Board to work towards such uniformity.Three commenters urged uniformity between banks and thrifts on the issuebut did not express a clear preference for Bank GAAP or Thrift GAAP. Approximatelytwo-thirds of the commenters expressing a preference favored the use ofBank GAAP. These commenters focussed on the congressional intent expressedin the CEBA that banks and thrifts be treated similarly for accountingpurposes. One commenter argued that use of the more conservative ThriftGAAP could adversely affect thrifts' ability to raise capital because itwould result in less favorable accounting numbers than Bank GAAP. Commenterssupporting the use of Thrift GAAP argued that discounting the cash flowof an asset held by a thrift at the institution's cost of capital wouldresult in a more accurate economic depiction of an asset's value. One tradeassociation commenter based its support for Thrift GAAP in part on thecurrent interest in this issue on the part of accounting standards settersand the likelihood that the accounting community is likely to move in thenear future to bring Bank GAAP into line with Thrift GAAP rather than thereverse. The FASB staff comment noted that the different NRV treatmentreflected ``longstanding industry practice'' and that the AICPA is consideringa ``comprehensive review of the Industry Audit Guides for financial institutions.''Disclosure A number of commenters discussed which, if any, financial statements shoulddisclose an institution's TDRs. The proposed regulation provided that counterstatements and monthly and quarterly reports to the Board should containline items disclosing both TDRs in compliance with their modified termsand TDRs not in compliance with their modified terms. Disclosures on annualaudited financial statements were to be made in accordance within FASB-15.All eight of the commenters addressing this issue argued that these disclosurerequirements were too broad. Six commenters argued that thrifts shouldnot be required to disclose TDRs on their counter statements. They statedthat counter statements did not contain sufficient space for accurate andcomplete information about an institution's TDRs and thus the disclosureof TDRs would be confusing to the public. Several commenters indicatedthat disclosures on counter statements would add to an institution's administrativeburdens. All of these commenters urged that the Board only require disclosureof TDRs in reports to the Board and annual audited financial statements.One commenter suggested that if the Board believed that disclosure of TDRson counter statements served a useful purpose, that a ``materiality'' standardbe used and that only TDRs above a certain threshold of total capital orassets be disclosed. This commenter also urged clarification of the scopeof required disclosures to carve out items excludable under footnote 25of FASB-15. Another commenter urged that levels of TDRs be given ``confidential''or ``non-public'' treatment on reports filed with the Board. One commenterurged the Board not to require disclosure of TDRs on any financial reports.One commenter believed that disclosure of TDRs was only appropriate onreports filed for capital market transactions.Classification Four commenters addressed the issue of classification of restructured loans.The proposed statement of policy indicated that restructured loans wouldneither be automatically classified nor automatically exempt from classification.Each loan would be reviewed on its own merits. Two commenters supportedthis approach. Two commenters expressed the view that only restructuredloans not in compliance with their modified terms should be classifiedand that loans that had previously been classified should be removed fromclassification upon restructuring so long as they remained in compliancewith their modified terms. Miscellaneous Several other issues were also raised. One commenter suggested that thriftsbe required to negotiate in good faith with borrowers in restructuringloans and be required to provide a report three months after reaching aninformal agreement on restructuring. One commenter suggested that the Boardincorporate additional explanatory language from the Securities and ExchangeCommission (``SEC'') release on in-substance foreclosure to clarify thefactors to be taken into account in determining when such a foreclosurehad occurred. Discussion After reviewing the comments submitted, the Board has determined to adoptthe rule and policy statement in substantially the form proposed, withthe modifications noted below. First, the Board has determined that thrift institutions should continueto follow the AICPA Guide for Savings and Loan Associations in accountingfor TDRs, specifically in determining the net realizable value of assets.The Board notes that regardless of the Board's position on the standardto be followed in preparing unaudited financial statements, accountantspreparing a thrift's annual audited statements would follow Thrift GAAP.The Board does not believe that under those circumstances the Bank GAAPnumbers in unaudited reports would be useful. The availability of two setsof financial reports showing different calculations could lead to unnecessaryconfusion about a thrift's condition. The Board notes that even a numberof commenters favoring the use of Bank GAAP agreed that Thrift GAAP wouldprovide a more accurate reflection of an asset's net realizable value.Although the CEBA generally indicates that similar accounting standards,<T3>i.e., </T3>GAAP, should apply to banks and thrifts, the statute doesnot deal with areas such as this, where GAAP itself differs between theindustries. As noted above, the FASB staff, in its comment to the Board,noted that this difference was the result of ``longstanding industry practice.''A number of commenters, including some favoring the use of Bank GAAP, notedthat it was more likely that the accounting profession would resolve thediscrepancy by using Thrift GAAP than Bank GAAP. The Board also notes thatthe Conference Report accompanying the CEBA expressly contemplates theuse of Thrift GAAP in determining an asset's net realizable value. ``Theuse of GAAP allows a loan to be carried at the lesser of cost or either(1) net realizable value (discounted value based on cash flow), or (2)a carrying value in accordance with FASB-15 debt restructuring where theoriginal obligor has remained in place.'' H.R. Rep. No. 261, 100th Cong.,lst Sess., at 165. Under these circumstances, the Board has determinedto require that thrifts follow Thrift GAAP in determining the net realizablevalue of assets. The Board may revisit this question, however, if the accountingprofession does not act to resolve the inconsistent treatment of thriftsand banks. Second, the Board has determined to remove the requirement that levelsof TDRs must be disclosed on an institution's counter statements. The Boardagrees with the commenters that such disclosures on the abbreviated counterstatements may prove more confusing than helpful to the public audiencereading those statements. Such information may prove useful to the Boardin reviewing a thrift's financial statements and loan portfolio, however.Therefore, the Board has determined to retain the requirement that levelsof TDRs must be reported in a thrift's unaudited monthly and quarterlyreports to the Board. The Board notes that banks must report TDRs in thecall reports filed with their regulators. The disclosures set forth inFASB-15 must be made on annual audited financial statements as providedin FASB-15. Third, the Board has determined that loans that have been restructuredwill continue to be reviewed for credit quality and classified where appropriatepursuant to the Board's classification of assets regulation. A borrower'scompliance with restructured terms standing alone may not in and of itselfraise the quality of a troubled loan and collateral above a classifiablelevel. The Board reiterates that TDRs will be reviewed under the same criteriaas all other loans in an institution's portfolio and should be neitherautomatically classified nor automatically exempt from classification.As noted in the proposal, this is consistent with the practice of otherfinancial regulatory agencies. In response to the suggestion that the Board incorporate additional languagefrom SEC Interpretive Rule 33-6679 on in-substance foreclosure, the Boardhas added additional language to the policy statement. This additionallanguage is designed to clarify the circumstances of such in-substanceforeclosures. Under FASB-15, a TDR may be reported as such in an institution's reportsand financial statements when ``consummated.'' The Board emphasizes, therefore,as it did in its proposal, that it expects that an institution and borrowerwill arrive at a formal agreement within a reasonable period of time followingthe start of negotiations. Normally, formal written agreements for restructuringshould result within six months from the start of negotiations. Negotiationsthat continue for a significantly longer period without a final writtenagreement between the thrift and the borrower may give rise to doubt aboutwhether the loan has actually been restructured. The Board assumes thatinstitutions and borrowers will negotiate TDRs in good faith. To summarize, the policy statement is intended to clarify: (1) When aninstitution may account for a loan as a TDR; (2) what constitutes a TDR;(3) that the Bank Board expects thrift institutions to account for alllosses that must be recognized under FASB-5 both before and after reportingany loan balance under FASB-15; (4) that FASB-5 must be followed not onlyin accruing losses that have occurred but also in making adequate disclosureof loss contingencies; (5) that, in accordance with FASB-15, any propertyreceived by the thrift institution in full or partial payment of a loan,including repossessions in substance, must be accounted for at fair value;(6) that TDRs must be reported in a thrift's monthly and quarterly financialreports, and in these reports and in audited financial statements disclosuresmust be in accordance with FASB-15; and (7) that TDRs will neither be automaticallyclassified, nor automatically exempt from classification, but will be reviewedunder the same criteria as all other loans in an institution's portfolio.Pursuant to 12 CFR 508.14, the Board finds that a thirty-day delay in theeffective date would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.The CEBA mandates that regulations be promulgated no later than January7, 1988. Although the reports for the current reporting period do not containinstructions for TDRs, in order for insured institutions to use TDR inaccordance with this rule and policy statement at the earliest possibletime the Board has determined that institutions should apply the rule andpolicy statement in accounting for TDRs for periods ending on or afterDecember 31, 1987. Instructions for reporting TDRs should be availablein time for the March, 1988 reports to the Board. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Need for and objectives of the rule. </T3>These elements are incorporatedabove in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>. 2. <T3>Issues raised by comments and agency assessment and response. </T3>Thecomments have been summarized and addressed in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2>section of this rule. 3. <T3>Significant alternatives minimizing small-entity impact and agencyresponse. </T3>The regulation and policy statement will not have a negativeimpact on small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 563 and 571 </ITAG>Accounting, Bank deposit insurance, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends Parts 563 and 571, Subchapter D, ChapterV, Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="76">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 563_OPERATIONS </ITAG>1.

Amend Part 571 by adding a new andSection; 571.18 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 571.18</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Accounting for troubled debt restructuring. </ITAG>(a) The purpose of this andSection; 571.18 is to offer to the managementof insured institutions the Board's views on troubled debt restructuring.This section is intended as guidance. It is not prescriptive, nor doesit have the force and effect of law.(b) All insured institutions should use the accounting treatment for troubleddebt restructuring (``TDR'') described in this section when preparing allfinancial reports for filing with the Board or the Corporation. All insuredinstitutions may use TDR for any loans, in compliance with Statement No.5 and Statement No. 15 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB-5''and ``FASB-15''). If a thrift chooses to use TDR, it should account forthe transaction as specified in FASB-5 and FASB-15. Allowances for losseson those loans should be determined as set forth in the AICPA IndustryGuide for Savings and Loan Associations. This statement of policy setsforth the policy and general criteria for determining what may be includedin TDR, when an insured institution must report a TDR, treatment of anytransfer of assets as part of a TDR, including treatment of repossessionsin substance, and how TDRs should be reported. This statement also setsforth the criteria under FASB-5 for when a loss must be recognized becausean asset has been impaired, regardless of TDR, and when loss contingenciesmust be disclosed. (c) The accounting standards for TDR are set forth in FASB Statement No.15, ``Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings,''which is summarized in this and following paragraphs. Further specificinformation may be found by referring to FASB-15. A TDR is a restructuringin which a creditor, such as a thrift, for economic or legal reasons relatedto a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrowerthat it would not otherwise consider. Extending or renewing a loan withno change in principal at a stated interest rate equal to the current interestrate for new loans at a similar level of risk is not considered a restructuredloan and should not be reported as such. A restructuring may involve atransfer of assets from the borrower to the thrift in full or partial satisfactionof the loan, a modification of the loan's terms, or both of the above.A restructuring may also involve the substitution or addition of a newdebtor for the original borrower. (d) FASB Statement No. 5, ``Accounting for Contingencies,'' also playsa significant role in the reporting of TDRs. FASB-5 governs when certainlosses must be recognized because a loss contingency is both probable andestimable and an asset has therefore been impaired or a liability has beenincurred. Further specific information may be found by referring to FASB-5.(e) TDR may not be used to avoid recognizing losses that FASB-5 requiresto be accrued. Estimated losses must be accrued by a charge to income iftwo conditions are met. First, available information indicates that itis probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability incurred atthe date of the financial statements. Second, the amount of the loss mustbe reasonably estimable. If both of these conditions are met for a loan,the institution must, both before and after restructuring, establish lossallowances for the difference between the carrying value of the loan andits net realizable value as determined in accordance with the AICPA IndusrryGuide for Savings and Loan Associations. The FASB-15 criteria are thenapplied to the net realizable value of the loan. (f) FASB-5 also requires adequate disclosure of loss contingencies notmeeting both of the above criteria under certain circumstances. Disclosureis required, for example, where there is at least a reasonable possibilitythat a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred or where anasset has probably been impaired but the amount of loss cannot reasonablybe estimated. Such disclosure should include a description of the lossor excess or additional loss contingency and either a range of possibleloss or a statement that no estimate of the loss can be made. (g) Under paragraph 6 of FASB-15, the date of consummation of the restructuringis the time of the restructuring. A TDR exists as soon as there is agreementbetween the institution and the borrower(s) (either prospective or existing)to consummate the restructuring. Thus, a TDR would clearly exist when aformal letter of intent or mutual agreement is signed. It would also bepresumed to exist, however, if the senior management of both the institutionand the borrower reach an oral agreement memorialized in written documentation,such as a memorandum to the files, setting forth the terms of the TDR.Institutions that report such informal or incomplete restructurings assumethe burden of formally completing the transaction, however. Failure todo so may result in reconsideration of any conclusions drawn as a resultof the anticipated restructuring and may require refilings of financialstatements. Normally a TDR should be finalized within six months from thestart of negotiations. The institution's history in finalizing expectedrestructurings will be reviewed by the Board's examiners. If an institution'sreported expected restructurings frequently do not result in formal consummationwithin a reasonable time, the examiner may decide to permit only formallycompleted TDRs to be reported as such.(h) A restructuring may involve the transfer of assets from the borrowerto the creditor institution in full or partial satisfaction of the loan.The proper treatment of assets received in partial satisfaction of theloan is set forth in paragraph (j) of this section. Assets transferredmay include, but are not limited to, receivables from third parties, realestate, or an equity interest in the borrower. Pursuant to paragraph 28of FASB-15, such assets must be accounted for at their fair value at thetime of the restructuring. Paragraph 13 of FASB-15 defines the ``fair valueof the assets transferred'' as the amount the borrower could reasonablyexpect to receive for them in a current sale between a willing buyer anda willing seller, <T3>i.e., </T3>other than a forced or liquidation sale. Paragraph 13 providesthat market value shall be used if an active market exists. If no marketprice is available for the asset or similar assets that could be used inestimating fair market value, a forecast of expected cash flows from theasset, discounted at a rate commensurate with any risk involved, may beused to arrive at fair value. (1) Such fair value accounting is required by FASB-15 when collateral isrepossessed by the institution. This fair value accounting treatment cannotbe avoided merely by delaying formal repossession. Under paragraph 34 ofFASB-15, a repossession in substance must be accounted for at fair valuein accordance with paragraph 28. Paragraph 84 of FASB-15 requires suchaccounting ``if, for example, the creditor obtains control or ownership(or substantially all of the benefits and risks incident to ownership)of one or more assets of the debtor and the debtor is wholly or partiallyrelieved of the obligations under the debt.'' The Board and the Corporationwill use the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission(``SEC'') as set forth in its Interpretive Release Number 33-6679 to determinewhen a repossession in substance has occurred. Under these guidelines,a repossession in substance will be deemed to have occurred when: (i) The borrower has little or no equity in the collateral, consideringthe current fair value of the collateral; and (ii) The creditor can only expect proceeds for the repayment of the loanto come from the operation or sale of the collateral; and (iii) The borrower has either_ (A) Formally or effectively abandoned control of the collateral to thecreditor; or (B) Retained control of the collateral but, because of its current financialcondition or economic prospects, it is unlikely that the borrower willbe able to rebuild equity in the collateral or otherwise repay the loanin the foreseeable future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis. A numberof factors will be considered in determining whether a repossession insubstance has occurred because it is unlikely that the borrower can rebuildequity in the ``foreseeable future.'' Among these are the institution'sexperience in previous recessionary cycles, the local market experiencewith real estate cycles, the borrower's financial condition and economicprospects, and the extent of the borrower's involvement in pursuing a reasonableworkout agreement. As the SEC noted in its Interpretive Rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">[O]ngoing debtor commitment is a factor in assessing whether collateralhas in substance been repossessed * * * [R]epossession accounting may notbe necessary when the debtor continues good faith efforts toward successfuloperation of the collateral and eventual repayment of the loan; provided,however, that the creditor can demonstrate a reasonable basis for concludingthat the loan will be ultimately collectible.</ITAG>(2) Assets received in full satisfaction of a loan must be recorded attheir fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the loan over thefair value of assets received in satisfaction of the loan must be recognizedas a loss. The carrying value of the loan is the loan balance, adjustedfor any unamortized premium or discount, less any allowance provided orany amount previously charged off, plus recorded accrued interest.(i) TDR may involve a modification of the terms of the loan. This modificationmay include, but is not limited to, a reduction in the stated interestrate, an extension of maturity at a favorable interest rate, a reductionin the face amount of the debt (principal), a reduction in accrued interest,or a combination of the above. The proper treatment of a TDR involvinga combination of a transfer of assets from the borrower to the institutionin partial satisfaction of the loan and a modification of the terms ofthe loan is set forth in paragraph (j) of this section. Both before andafter a TDR is implemented, an adequate allowance for loss must be providedin accordance with FASB-5. Under GAAP, this allowance must be based onnet realizable value to determine the appropriate carrying value of theloan being restructured. (1) If the total expected future cash receipts (including both principaland interest) reasonably expected to be collected under the modified repaymentterms are less than the carrying value of the loan on the institution'sbooks, after any necessary FASB-5 adjustment, then a loss on restructuringmust be recognized to the extent of that deficiency. Under these circumstances,no interest income will be recognized over the life of the restructuredloan. (2) If the total expected future cash receipts are equal to or exceed thecarrying value of the loan, after any necessary FASB-5 adjustment, no losson restructuring need be reported. Interest income will be recognized overthe life of the loan to the extent that future receipts exceed the carryingvalue of the loan. Institutions should recognize this income using an effectiveinterest rate that will yield a constant rate of interest over the remaininglife of the loan. (3) Some restructurings may involve indeterminate future cash receipts.To the extent that the minimum future cash receipts are less than the carryingvalue of the loan, the institution must recognize a loss. This loss mustbe recognized under paragraph 32 of FASB-15, unless under the modifiedterms the contingent future cash receipts needed to make the total futurecash receipts under the modified terms equal to the carrying value of theloan, after any necessary FASB-5 adjustment, are both probable and arereasonably estimable. (j) Some TDRs may involve both a transfer of assets from the borrower tothe institution in partial satisfaction of the loan and a modificationof the terms of the remaining loan. In these circumstances, the restructuringmust be accounted for by a two-stage process under paragraph 33 of FASB-15.First, the carrying value of the loan is reduced by the fair value of theproperty received, as calculated pursuant to paragraph 13 of FASB-15. Second,the total amount of the expected future cash receipts is compared to theremaining carrying value of the loan. Any loss recognized is limited tothe excess of the remaining carrying value of the loan over such totalfuture cash receipts. If the total expected cash receipts exceed the remainingrecorded amount of the loan, no loss need be recognized, and any futureinterest income should be recognized at a constant effective interest rateover the life of the loan. (k) Some TDRs may involve the substitution or addition of a new debtorfor the original borrower. Pursuant to paragraph 42 of FASB-15, such arestructuring should be accounted for according to its substance. If underthe restructuring the substitute or additional debtor controls, is controlledby, or is under common control with the original borrower, or performsthe custodial function of collecting certain of the original borrower'sfunds, FASB-15 provides that the restructuring should be accounted foras a modification of terms. If the substitute or additional debtor doesnot have such a control or custodial relationship with the original borrower,the restructuring should be accounted for as a new loan in full or partialsatisfaction of the original borrower's loan. The new loan should be recordedat its fair value. (l) As provided in andSection; 563.23-4 of this subchapter, restructuredloans are to be reported in all monthly and quarterly reports to the Boardor the Corporation. In these reports and annual audited reports filed withthe Board, all disclosures and information required by FASB-5 and FASB-15should be provided. The carrying value of an asset received in full orpartial satisfaction of the loan is not reportable as a restructured loan.(m) Examiners will continue to monitor institutions' loan portfolios, includingrestructured loans. Loans will not automatically be classified merely becausethey have been restructured. Conversely, loans will not be exempt fromclassification merely because they have been restructured. Where appropriateunder the criteria set forth in andSection; 561.16c, a restructured loanmay be classified.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
