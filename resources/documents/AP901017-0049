(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Air Force Academy cadets -male and female - who had sex in an academy dormitory are facingdismissal, as are six others who secretly watched, officials said.   The Aug. 29 incident apparently was plotted by six male cadetsto help a friend break off a relationship with the female cadet,Air Force Capt. Rick Sanford of the academy's public relationsoffice said today.   Six male cadets hid inside the darkened room to watch theirfriend have sex with the woman, who was unaware that anyone elsewas in the room, Col. Mike Wallace, academy director of publicaffairs, said Tuesday.   Air Force policy prohibits sexual activity in academy dorms, andoffenders usually are expelled, Wallace said. Male and femalecadets are allowed to study together until 11 p.m. in each other'srooms.   The female cadet, a sophomore, learned that others had been inthe room through rumors that surfaced in late September.   Officials learned of the incident when the female was treated atthe academy hospital Sept. 28 for an apparent overdose of a painreliever. She told doctors and academy officials she was distraughtover the incident and took the pills because of severe headaches,Wallace said.   She told officials that she wasn't trying to kill herself, andhospital personnel agreed. But the dose was ``life-threatening,''and her stomach had to be pumped, Wallace said.   The woman will face a disciplinary board when she returns to theacademy, Wallace said. She is hospitalized because of an abscessedlarynx that was scratched during the stomach pumping.   The man who participated in the sex submitted his resignation,Wallace said, and disciplinary boards recommended dismissal for theother six men. Four of them have submitted resignations, and twoare awaiting hearings before high-ranking officers.   The Pentagon must approve the resignations and dismissals.   Wallace said several cadets each year are kicked out forengaging in sex in the dorms. Last year, three incidents werereported and four cadets were dismissed, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
