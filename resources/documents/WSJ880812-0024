Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar fell on a combination of warnings by West German officials, a cautionary Bank of England report on the U.S. trade deficit and profit-taking.    Dealers described trading as nervous and volatile. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8847 marks, down from 1.9070 late Wednesday. The U.S. currency fell to 132.81 yen from 133.65 yen. Meanwhile, the pound inched up to $1.7100 from $1.6975 on Wednesday.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was changing hands at about 133.05 yen.    In the past two days, the dollar has given up all its gains since a run up last Friday linked to traders' attempts to challenge what many believed was a threshold of tolerance by central banks at 1.90 marks and to the boost the dollar received from the half-point U.S. discount-rate increase on Tuesday. Since late Tuesday, when it stood at 1.9210 marks in New York, the dollar has fallen nearly 2%.    &quot;Quite frankly, it's a giveback right now. Traders are just taking profits from their long positions,&quot; said Carmine Rotondo, a vice president at Security Pacific National Bank in New York. &quot;The dollar took such a spike up the last couple of weeks, there had to be a retracement.&quot;    The dollar's retreat was prompted by a combination of profit-taking and rumors that senior monetary officials from the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations were planning an emergency meeting on exchange-rate policy. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Adding to the decline was a statement in Bonn by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg that further increases in the dollar could lead to higher German interest rates. Higher rates usually help boost a currency's value by making it more attractive to foreign investors.    The West German finance minister said G-7 finance ministers and central-bank heads weren't planning a meeting to discuss currency issues before scheduled talks late next month at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Berlin.    The dollar was also hurt by statements from West German central bank President Karl Otto Poehl and a report by the Bank of England. In an interview in the Aug. 22 issue of Forbes magazine, the Bundesbank president said a stronger U.S. currency &quot;doesn't serve anyone's interests.&quot; Before reports of the interview were carried on wire services, the dollar had received a short boost when major U.S. banks increased their prime lending rates half a point to 10%.    The British central bank report warned that recent declines in the U.S. trade deficit may have led to overly optimistic expectations concerning the speed of the deficit's fall. &quot;Basically, they were saying 'Hey guys, you shouldn't be jumping up and down just because of a few months improvement in trade,'&quot; said Liliana Nealon, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.    Adding to the dollar's woes, said traders, was Senate testimony by William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., that the FDIC is watching two major banks, which weren't identified, for potential problems.    Traders said the dollar's fall accelerated when it pierced 1.8960 marks, a key point on charts that many traders use to predict currency movements. &quot;There was good selling interest; and when we hit 1.8960, stop/loss orders were triggered,&quot; said Martin McNulty, a vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC in New York.    To defend their currencies, West Germany and Japan have allowed domestic interest rates to increase marginally. While many traders and analysts last Friday expected central banks, especially the Bundesbank, to intervene vigorously to push the dollar lower, the banks have been absent the past two days. Officials appear to have resorted to talking the currency down, which has had a noticeable effect in a very uncertain environment.    Traders also said the market was nervously approaching next Tuesday's release of the U.S. trade results for June. While predictions vary widely from a deficit of $9 billion to $13 billion, the consensus is for a figure of about $11 billion.    &quot;The market is still going to consolidate until we get the trade number on Tuesday,&quot; said Mr. McNulty. &quot;Trade will give the major direction for the market.&quot;    A June trade deficit below $11 billion &quot;would send the dollar bulls out of the woodwork again,&quot; said Ms. Nealon.    Mr. McNulty said that if the figure is a single-digit one, the market will &quot;challenge 1.9250 marks, a very strong resistance level.&quot; On the other hand, if the deficit is as high as $13 billion or $14 billion, the U.S. currency could fall to 1.85 marks before finding support, he said.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold settled at $429.30 an ounce, up 10 cents. Estimated volume was a light to moderate 2.7 million ounces.    In trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $429.60 an ounce.    ----                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, August 11, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
