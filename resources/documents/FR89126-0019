Background</ITAG>In 1978, a major manufacturer of infant formulas reformulated two of itssoy products by discontinuing the addition of salt. This reformulationresulted in the manufacture of products containing an inadequate amountof chloride, an essential nutrient. By mid 1979, hypochloremic metabolicalkalosis, a syndrome associated with chloride deficiency, had been diagnosedin a substantial number of infants. Most of the cases resulted from prolongedand exclusive use of these soy infant formulas.After reviewing the matter, Congress determined that, to improve protectionof infants using infant formula products, modifications of industry's andFDA's recall procedures were needed. In addition, greater regulatory controlover the formulation and production of infant formulas was needed. Accordingly,Congress passed, and the President signed into law on September 26, 1980,the Infant Formula Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-359). The Infant Formula Actof 1980 (the 1980 act) is codified in section 412 of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 350a). In 1982, FDA implementedthe infant formula recall procedures, as prescribed for in section 412(d)of the act, by establishing Subpart D of 21 CFR Part 7 (see 47 FR 18832;April 30, 1982). In 1982, FDA also implemented the Infant Formula QualityControl Procedures, as provided for in section 412(a)(2)(D) of the act,by establishing 21 CFR Part 106 (see 47 FR 17016; April 20, 1982). In 1985,FDA further implemented the 1980 act by establishing Subparts B, C, andD in 21 CFR Part 107 regarding Infant Formula Labeling, Exempt Infant Formula,and Nutrient Requirements for Infant Formula, respectively (see 50 FR 1833,January 14, 1985; 50 FR 45106, October 30, 1985; and 50 FR 48183, November22, 1985).More recently, Congress amended section 412 of the act as a provision ofthe Drug Enforcement, Education, and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570)to address recent concerns expressed by Congress and consumers about theInfant Formula Act of 1980. The President signed the amendments on October27, 1986. The 1986 amendments require the agency to publish regulationsconcerning current good manufacturing practices and quality control proceduresfor infant formula and regulations for the maintenance of records associatedwith these practices and procedures, including consumer complaint files.The 1986 amendments significantly enlarge FDA's authority to require theretention of records and to make such records available to agency representatives.Specifically, the amendments provide for:1. The retention of all records necessary to demonstrate compliance withgood manufacturing practices and quality control procedures prescribedby the Secretary under paragraph (2) [of the amendments] including recordscontaining the results of all testing required under paragraph (2)(B) [Paragraphs(2) and (2)(B) refer to good manufacturing practices and quality controlprocedures determined to be necessary by the Secretary, and specify testingfor each required nutrient in each batch prior to distribution, the regularlyscheduled testing during the shelf life of the infant formula, the testingand in-process controls designed to prevent adulteration of each batch,and the conduct of regularly scheduled audits to determine compliance withgood manufacturing practices and quality control procedures.];2. The retention of all certifications or guarantees of analysis by premixsuppliers;3. The retention by a premix supplier of all records necessary to confirmthe accuracy of all premix certifications and guarantees of analysis;4. The retention of_a. All records pertaining to the microbiological quality and purity ofraw materials used in infant formula powder and in finished infant formula,and b. All records pertaining to food packaging materials which show that suchmaterials do not cause an infant formula to be adulterated within the meaningof section 402(a).5. The retention of all records of the results of regularly scheduled auditsconducted pursuant to the requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and6. The retention of all complaints and the maintenance of files with respectto, and the review of, complaints concerning infant formulas which mayreveal the possible existence of a hazard to health.No comparable provisions existed in the prior law. In adopting the 1986amendments, Congress recognized that the retention of records by manufacturersand access on the part of the agency to such records are of critical importancein assuring that infant formulas are safe and have been manufactured inan appropriate manner. The amendments give FDA broad authority to requirethe retention of and access to records, including ``all'' records of certaintypes. It is for this reason the agency has decided to propose regulationsconcerning these record retention requirements.The 1986 amendments to the Infant Formula Act also impose additional obligationson the agency concerning the promulgation of regulations establishing variousother requirements pertaining to infant formulas. Because of these additionalobligations, the agency is also proposing certain microbiological testingrequirements and guidelines for use in determining when particular microorganismsare present at a level that may result in an adulterated product, requirementsfor additional nutrient testing and manufacturer's audits, and requirementsconcerning consumer complaints. The agency also plans to publish a secondproposal at a later date to further amend the infant formula regulationsconcerning current good manufacturing practices and quality control proceduresas required by the 1986 amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Overview of the Proposed Regulation</ITAG>The agency is proposing to amend its existing regulations concerning infantformula (21 CFR Part 106) to reflect the statutory changes concerning theretention of records, including consumer complaint files and the need totest for potential microbiological contaminants in powdered infant formula.The proposed regulations mirror the broad authority Congress provided theagency in this area.The proposed regulations pertain to records concerning (1) the verificationof the presence of required nutrients in infant formula in accordance withsection 412(i) of the Act and in 21 CFR 107.100; (2) specific nutrienttesting results at the ``final product stage''; (3) premix certificationsor guarantees; (4) microbiological quality and purity of raw materialsin powdered infant formulas and in finished infant formulas; (5) food packagingmaterials; (6) manufacturer's audits, and (7) complaints. Each aspect ofthe proposed regulations is discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Records Pertaining to Microbiological Quality and Purity of RawMaterials and Finished Infant Formula</ITAG>A. BackgroundThe 1986 amendments require the retention of ``all records pertaining tothe microbiological quality and purity of raw materials used in infantformula powder and in finished infant formula.'' This portion of the 1986amendments provides authority to review, evaluate, and copy all recordscontaining microbiological testing results for raw materials used in themanufacture of powdered infant formula and the testing results for finishedinfant formula, both powdered and liquid. The 1986 amendments also provideFDA the authority to review, evaluate, and copy records containing thespecifications used by an infant formula manufacturer to evaluate the resultsof its microbiological testing. In establishing these requirements, Congressrecognized that infant formula is a special category of food that needsstringent safeguards that must include criteria to determine its microbiologicalquality and purity. Stringent microbiological safeguards are necessarybecause infant formula is often the only source of nourishment for an infant,and infants are far more sensitive than adults to many foodborne microorganismsor their toxins. (An infant's high degree of sensitivity is due to suchfactors as an underdeveloped immune system, high gastric pH, and unstablebowel flora.)B. Powdered Infant FormulaPowdered infant formulas, unlike the liquid products, are not packagedin hermetically-sealed containers and then heated (cooked) until the productis commercially sterile. Accordingly, the low microbial levels that areroutinely achieved for liquid products cannot be attained for powderedproducts. Therefore, manufacturers of powdered infant formulas rely primarilyon a lack of moisture to prevent microbial growth in the product.Prior to the 1986 amendments and the regulation proposed herein to implementthese amendments, the agency has not had the authority to require testingor obtain access to the testing records of the powdered products. (TheGood Manufacturing Practice Regulations for Thermally Processed Low-AcidFoods Packaged in Hermetically Sealed Containers (21 CFR Part 113) containtesting, recordkeeping, and access requirements concerning the commercialsterility of the liquid product.) Consequently, in the past, there havebeen occasions where infants became ill as a result of microbial contaminationof the powdered product.\1\<NOTE/> Conditions conducive to microbial growth occur when the microbiallevel present in the dry formula is excessive and the diluted product isnot refrigerated as instructed on the label. For these reasons, there isa need to require manufacturers to test and evaluate the microbial qualityof the finished powdered infant formulas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>``Salmonella eling </T3>Infections Associated With the Consumptionof Infant Dried Milk,'' <T3>The Lancet, </T3>2(856):900-903, October 17, 1987.This requirement of the proposed regulations is based on the premise thattesting powdered formula at the final product stage is sufficient to determinewhen raw materials containing excessive levels of microbial contaminationare used in the manufacture of powdered infant formula or when a powderedformula has inadvertently become microbiologically contaminated duringprocessing.C. Microbiological Testing Requirements for Powdered Infant FormulaIn deciding which microorganisms powdered infant formula manufacturersshould test for, the agency has reviewed and evaluated data and informationconcerning the potential for microbiological contamination in infant formula.This review included the studies on Microbiological Quality of Dry-MilkMixes and Milk Substitute Infant Formulas; Microbiological Guidelines andSampling Plans for Dried Infant Cereals and Powdered Infant Formula froma Canadian National Microbiological Survey; and the report from the InternationalCommission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods, 1974, as presentedin the book ``Microorganisms in Foods 2,'' Chapter 10. In light of thereview,\2\<NOTE/> the agency has concluded that manufacturers must test forthose pathogenic microorganisms that have been found in infant formulaand raw materials used for infant formula and those microorganisms thathave been associated with manufacturing practices that enhance bacterialgrowth. These microorganisms include <T3>Salmonella </T3>species, <T3>Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacilluscereus, </T3>and <T3>Clostridium perfringens </T3>as well as those microorganisms detectedby an Aerobic Plate Count.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Proposed Microbiological Criteria for Powdered Dry-Milk,Milk-Derived, and Milk Substitute Infant Formulas''; copy on file withthe Dockets Management Branch (address above).The studies and information reviewed by the agency do not mention the needto test for <T3>L. monocytogenes. </T3>However, FDA has in routine testing begun todetect <T3>L. monocytogenes </T3>in milk and milk products. This organism representsa potential life-threatening situation if present in infant formula and,therefore, has been included among those for which testing would be required.The agency has identified in Table I the levels for each of the above microorganismsat which a health concern may arise. This concern can be particularly alarmingwhen infant formula containing excessive microbial levels is also misusedby consumers who do not strictly follow the directions for preparationand use given on each container.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,3,6</C><T4>Table I._Infant Formula Microbiological Guidelines</T4><H1>Bacteria </H1><H1>n </H1><H1>M</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Salmonella </T3><D>60 </D><D>\1\ 0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Listeria monoyctogenes </T3><D>10 </D><D>\1\ 0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Escherichia coli </T3><D>5 </D><D>\1\</D>andless;3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Staphylococcus aureus </T3><D>5 </D><D>\1\ 3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Bacillus cereus </T3><D>10 </D><D>\2\ 1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Clostridium perfringens </T3><D>10 </D><D>\2\ 1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aerobic plate count <D>5 </D><D>\3\ 10,000</D><F>Key: n = number of units sampled; M is on a per gram basis.</F><F>\1\ Fails test if any unit exceeds the value (M).</F><F>\2\ Fails test if 2 or more units exceed 100 organisms/gram or any unitexceeds the value (M).</F><F>\3\ Fails test if 3 or more units exceed 1,000 organisms/gram or anyunit exceeds the value (M).</F></ITAG></ITAG>The agency intends to treat these levels as guidelines for manufacturers'use in determining when particular microorganisms are present at a levelthat may result in an adulterated product. The agency has decided to usethese levels as guidelines rather than propose tolerances because scientificunderstanding of microbial food contamination is evolving quickly in thisarea and the methodology for identifying microorganisms is also undergoingrapid change. The proposed testing requirement for potential microbiologicalcontaminants and the levels given above are consistent with (1) the standardadopted by the International Commission on Microbiological Specificationsfor Foods of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nationsand the World Health Organization, and (2) results from FDA and CanadianSurveys as given in the reports referenced above.The agency has also decided upon the sampling plan and the analytical methodsthat it will use in applying the microbiological guidelines. It is importantfor manufacturers to have this information because microbiological testingresults depend upon the methods used. The methodology to be used by FDAis standard for testing this food class for these microorganisms and utilizesa statistically acceptable sample size.The methodology that FDA will be using when sampling infant formula productsis given in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM), 6th Edition (1984),and subsequent revisions, published by the Association of Official AnalyticalChemists, 1111 North 19th St., Suite 210, Arlington, VA 22209, except forthe method for <T3>L monocytogenes. </T3>The method for <T3>L monocytogenes </T3>is available at the Dockets Management Branch(address above) and will be included in the next edition of BAM. For <T3>Salmonella, </T3>FDA will use the methodology described in Chapter7, BAM. The sample preparation procedures described in paragraph 1, SectionC of Chapter 7 will be used. For <T3>E coli, </T3>FDA will use the methodology described in Chapter 5, BAM;for <T3>S. aureus, </T3>the methodology described in Chapter 14, BAM; for <T3>B. cereus, </T3>the methodology described in Chapter 16, BAM; for <T3>C. perfringens, </T3>the methodology described in Chapter 17, BAM;and for the Aerobic Plate Count, the methodology described in Chapter 4,BAM.D. Lot Testing for Potential Microbiological ContaminationThe proposed regulation contains the requirement that manufacturers testeach lot of powdered infant formula for each of the microorganisms identifiedin Table I. However, the proposal also provides manufacturers the opportunityto identify alternate approaches. In offering an alternate approach, amanufacturer would have to justify why each lot of powdered infant formulashould not be tested for each identified microorganism. (For example, stringentraw material specifications and in-process heating of the product may routinelyresult in levels of microorganisms significantly below the levels identifiedabove. In this case, spot checking, checking of one or more indicator microorganism,or some other procedure may be sufficient to confirm the microbiologicalquality for each lot of final product.) To support the alternate approach,a manufacturer would also have to submit a complete description of qualitycontrol procedures, current good manufacturing practices, raw materialspecifications, processing procedures and specifications, and test resultsdemonstrating a history of meeting these criteria. In addition, the manufacturerwould have to justify how the alternate testing proposed is sufficientto assure the microbiological quality of the finished product.Appropriate types of testing and testing frequency will vary dependingon manufacturing procedures. Thus, more specific identification of informationneeded to obtain agency agreement is not possible. If the agency does notagree with the manufacturer's recommendation that it is not necessary totest for each microorganism in each lot, the agency will notify the manufacturerof that decision.The 1986 amendments specifically require that all records pertaining tothe microbiological quality and purity of raw materials used in powderedinfant formula and in finished infant formula be retained as required byandSection;106.100(m). Accordingly, the proposal calls for the retentionof all records related to required testing for 1 year after the expirationof the shelf life of the infant formula or 3 years from the date of manufacture,whichever is greater.E. Microbial Quality of Raw MaterialsThe agency is proposing to require microbial testing of the final productonly. The agency's rationale for placing requirements on the final productrather than raw materials is based on the fact that the level of microbialcontamination in raw materials may or may not be indicative of the microbiallevel in the final product. Potential microbiological contamination maybe introduced by raw materials or through improper processing or holdingprocedures. Final product testing would determine microbiological contaminationfrom all of these sources. However, some manufacturers may find it in theirbest interests to test and evaluate the microbial quality of the raw material,as well as the final product. Although the agency is not proposing to requireraw material microbiological testing, the agency is proposing that whenthe manufacturer performs such testing, the manufacturer must maintainthe records of the testing and must permit FDA access to the records. Thisrequirement will allow FDA to evaluate the results of the testing in thecontext of the processing procedures and specifications used by the manufacturerand will help identify any potential or real contamination problems.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Complaints</ITAG>The 1986 amendments require ``the retention of all complaints and the maintenanceof files with respect to, and the review of, complaints concerning infantformulas which may reveal the possible existence of a hazard to health.''The agency proposes to define a complaint as any allegation, written orverbal, expressing dissatisfaction with the product for any reason thatmay reveal the possible existence of a hazard to health, including complaintsabout appearance, taste, odor, and quality. FDA is narrowing this definitionto exclude correspondence about price, package size or shape, or othermatters that could not possibly reveal the existence of a hazard to health.FDA believes that this definition, even with its qualifications is sufficientlybroad to assure the protection of the public health because it requiresinvestigation of all allegations that may reveal the possible existenceof a hazard to health.FDA is also proposing that complaints be separated into two classes; (1)those complaints which indicate that an infant became ill from consumingthe product or that the infant required treatment by a physician or healthcare provider, and (2) those complaints that may involve a possible existenceof a hazard to health but do not refer to an infant becoming ill or tothe need for a physician's care. The agency believes that classifying complaintsin this manner will assist in identifying complaints that call for FDA'smost intensive review, and will expedite FDA's identification of potentialhealth problems.Moreover, the agency is proposing to require that manufacturers maintaina designated file for complaint records. The proposed regulations providethat each complaint file must contain the name of the infant formula, lotnumber, name of the complainant, copy of the complaint, all correspondencewith the complainant, and all associated manufacturing records and complaintinvestigation records necessary to evaluate the complaint. The regulationswould also require that the complaint file include the manufacturer's evaluationsand findings concerning the complaint and a notation of the actions takento follow up on any complaint that identified a possible existence of ahazard to health. FDA believes it is critical that information regardingserious health effects be investigated and promptly reported to FDA. Accordingly,FDA will immediately initiate its own investigation into this matter. Underexisting regulations, manufacturers must promptly notify FDA whenever theyhave knowledge that an infant formula may present a hazard to human health.In this rulemaking, the agency is proposing a specific requirement thatmanufacturers must notify FDA within 15 days whenever an investigationindicates there is a reasonable probability of a casual relationship betweenan infant's death and the consumption of an infant formula. The notifcationshall be within 15 days of receiving such information. Moreover, the proposedregulations provide that when a manufacturer does not conduct an investigationof a complaint, the complaint file must include an explanation of why noinvestigation was conducted and the name of the responsible individualmaking the decision not to investigate.The agency believes all the foregoing proposed requirements concerningthe maintenance of a complaint file are essential to ensure the collectionof the information necessary to provide an evaluation of the significanceof a consumer complaint and to determine whether a hazard to health mayexist. These criteria are consistent with agency requirements concerningconsumer complaints on drugs, medical devices, biologics, and cosmetics.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Retention of Records Demonstrating Compliance With Good ManufacturingPractices and Quality Control Procedures</ITAG>The 1986 amendments require manufacturers to test for (1) all requirednutrients in each batch of infant formula prior to distribution to ensurecompliance with section 412(b)(3)(C) of the act, and (2) vitamins A, B<T2>1</T2>, C, and E at the ``final product stage'' in order to ensurethat each batch of infant formula is in compliance wth section 412(b)(3)(A)and 412(i) of the act. The amendments also call for testing to verify theshelf life of the infant formula as a means of ensuring compliance withsection 412(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the act. The proposed regulations would classifyrecords containing the results of all these tests as ``necessary'' recordsand, accordingly, require the retention of all the test results. FDA wouldneed access to these records containing test results in order to determinewhether standard procedures and practices have been followed during themanufacture of infant formula and to determine the cause of any observeddeviations in nutrient concentrations.The 1986 amendments also require the retention of all certifications andguarantees of analyses by premix suppliers and all records necessary toconfirm the accuracy of the analyses made to provide the basis of premixcertification and guarantees for the period of time required by andSection;106.100(m). Premix manufacturers routinely maintain a record of the purityof the nutrient or ingredient, the amount of each nutrient or ingredientadded to a premix, and the analytical testing results necessary to verifythe addition of the correct amounts and purity of each nutrient. The agencyis, therefore, proposing that it is necessary to retain all of these recordsand make them available for FDA review and evaluation upon request. Thereview of all of these records is necessary to be certain that a premixhas been properly prepared.Moreover, the 1986 amendments provide that manufacturers must retain recordsto demonstrate completion of regularly scheduled audits as required bysection 412(b)(4)(A)(v) of the act. Accordingly, the agency is proposingthat manufacturers maintain documentation establishing that regularly scheduledaudits by appropriately trained individuals: (1) Are conducted; (2) assurecompliance with current good manufacturing practices and quality controlprocedures; and (3) follow the firm's complete audit plans and procedures.Without such information the agency would not be able to ascertain whenor if manufacturers are conducting audits properly.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Records Pertaining to Chemical Contaminants</ITAG>The agency is also concerned about potential chemical contaminants whichmay cause an infant formula to become adulterated. For this reason, andbecause retention of chemical contaminants records is involved, the agencyconsidered including, in this ``record retention'' proposal, a requirementthat manufacturers conduct tests for potential chemical contaminants andthat the results of these tests be retained and made available for FDAreview. However, after reviewing the issues involving the establishmentof current good manufacturing practices to control potential chemical contaminants,the agency has concluded it would be more appropriate to address the issuesin the proposal on current good manufacturing practices quality controlthat the agency expects to issue in the near future.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Miscellaneous Records</ITAG>The 1986 amendments require the retention of all records that pertain tofood-packaging materials and that show that such materials do not causean infant formula to be adulterated by virtue of the fact that the formulacontains an unsafe food additive (within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)of the act). Any available information that indicates whether food-packagingmaterials do or do not result in the presence of unapproved food additivesin infant formula is, by necessity, required to be retained and availablefor FDA review. The proposed regulations, accordingly, contain this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Conditions of Retention and Maintenance of Records</ITAG>The 1986 amendments also require that records be retained for at least1 year after the expiration of the shelf life of the products. The agencyis proposing to require record retention for at least 1 year after theexpiration of the shelf life of the product or 3 years from date of manufacture,whichever is greater. The 3-year limitation makes this proposed requirementconsistent with the record retention requirement in 21 CFR 113.100 forthermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Economic Impact</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) andExecutive Order 12291, the economic effects of this proposed rule havebeen analyzed. This proposed rule merely implements the requirements ofthe 1986 amendments and will not generate costs beyond those necessitatedby the amendments.Therefore, FDA certifies in accordance with section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that no significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities will derive from this action. Further, in accordancewith Executive Order 12291, FDA certifies that this proposed rule willnot result in a major rule as defined by that order.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Section 106.100 of this proposed rule contains collection of informationrequirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for its review of this collection of informationrequirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit commentson the collection of information requirements should direct them to FDA'sDockets Management Branch (address above) and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington,DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII.
