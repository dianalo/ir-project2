ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If snappy quotes sold for a buck apiece,Norman J. Ornstein would be a wealthy man.   A political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, aright-of-center think tank, Ornstein is hardly a household name.But he happens to be one of the most widely quoted people inWashington.   At the ring of a telephone, he spouts expert opinions on justabout any topic, from perestroika to peanut subsidies, from ethicsto ethnic restaurants.   He's the ``King of Quotes,'' the sultan of sound bites, the imamof instant analysis, the titan of talking heads. He's the darlingof TV producers and the garrulous savior of quote-hungry newspaperreporters battling a deadline.   ``If I have an opinion, I'll give it,'' he says.   Jo-Ann Moriarty remembers her introduction to Ornstein in 1986,when she was a rookie Washington reporter for States News Serviceand needed some quotes for an election-year story she was writingabout Rep. James Broyhill, R-N.C.   ``The guy at the next desk said, `Have you called Norm Ornsteinyet?' I said, `Norm who?' He said, ``He's Mr. CongressionalComment.' So I phoned Ornstein, and he returned my callimmediately.''   She felt flattered, then astonished.   ``I asked him about Broyhill, and it was like pressing a button.He just spit it all out, everything I wanted to know,'' said Ms.Moriarty, who was grateful for Ornstein's punchy one-liners but abit embarrassed that she'd never heard of him before.   ``I just didn't realize he was such a big cheese,'' she said.   Journalists praise Ornstein for his insider's savvy, hisaccessibility and his ability to cut quickly to the essence of acomplex subject in lively, easy-to-understand language.   ``He's a master of the pithy quote,'' says Peggy Robinson,senior political producer for public TV's ``MacNeil-LehrerNewsHour,'' where Ornstein frequently appears as a guestcommentator.   ``I try to restrain myself and not quote Ornstein too often,''says Helen Dewar, congressional correspondent for The WashingtonPost. ``But when I'm analyzing a situation, I'm frequently curiouswhat he thinks. And he will unfailingly say something I just haveto quote. It's too good to pass up. No one puts it so concisely orso well.''   How did Ornstein become Washington's most quotable man?   ``I was sitting in a Laundromat a couple of blocks from near myapartment on Capitol Hill in the early 1970s, twiddling my thumbswhile my clothes were in the dryer,'' he recalled.   He'd just finished reading a book about former Harlemcongressman Adam Clayton Powell, and thought it would make for aninteresting book review.   ``I had a yellow pad and a pen, so I just dashed off a review inan hour, and sent it to the Post. They printed it on the front pageof the Style section with a picture.''   A short time later, he talked to a feature writer about hisfavorite country inns. His quotes popped up in a Page One story inthe Wall Street Journal. ``I was thunderstruck,'' Ornstein said.And bitten by the media bug.   He started writing reviews and Op-Ed pieces for the Post and TheNew York Times, which led to stints as a commentator anddocumentary editor for public television, which led to appearanceson network TV talk shows.   As his visibility grew, reporters started calling him for quotesto lend an authoritative ring to their stories. Ornstein happilyobliged.   ``I had a pretty good feel for what journalists were lookingfor, and I found frankly that it served my own interests,'' hesaid. ``I could learn an awful lot by talking to reporters who wereworking on stories in ways that I didn't have the time to domyself. There could be a pooling, a sharing of information.''   To keep abreast of things, Ornstein, 41, reads voraciously _ atleast five newspapers every day plus stacks of magazines andacademic journals. He goes to Capitol Hill three days a week toroam the corridors. He spends about two hours a day talking tojournalists.   He attends luncheons, seminars, receptions and speaking eventsto ``schmooze and pick things up.'' He even quizzes fellow airlinepassengers and fathers on the sidelines of neighborhood soccergames.   Spoofing Ornstein's supposed omniscience, the irreverent NewYork magazine Spy peppered a special Washington edition last monthwith no fewer than 17 opinions from Ornstein on everything fromtaxi fares to sex scandals. President Bush ranked second with 14references.   ``One of Spy's editors called to say they'd gotten hundreds ofletters,'' Ornstein said with a chuckle. ``Most of them asked, `Whothe hell is this guy Norman Ornstein?'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 17</NOTE></DOC>
