Mulroney, ending two days of meetings with administration andCapitol Hill leaders, told reporters, ``I am leaving with theassurance that congressional consideration will proceed on scheduledespite the uncertaintly surrounding the omnibus trade bill.''   The schedule calls for Congress to put enabling legislation forthe U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement on a ``fast track'' as soon asthe administration sends the bill to Congress, sometime after June1.   The agreement, hailed by Mulroney and Reagan as ``historic,''provides for eventual elimination of tariffs and other steps tostimulate what is already the world's highest-volume bilateraltrading relationship.   The pact is separate from the overall trade bill adoptedWednesday but there have been muted threats on Capitol Hill thatimplementation of the U.S.-Canada pact eagerly sought by Reaganmight be slowed as a protest over his planned veto of the tradebill.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Sen. LloydBentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, havesaid they would not hold the Canadian accord ``hostage,'' and theseassurances were given to Mulroney in meetings on Thursday, theCanadian leader said.   In those discussions _ and in his second meeting with Reagan inas many days _ Mulroney reasserted his plea that the United Statesset specific timetables and targets for the reduction of acid rain,which carries pollution and kills lakes and forests.   ``I told the president what I told the leadership of the Senateand the House: that a treaty on acid rain between Canada and theUnited States is inevitable, just as surely as summer followsspring,'' he said.   The Reagan administration says more scientific investigation isneeded before it makes a commitment to specific clean-up goals.   Mulroney said he and Reagan decided that Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz and Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clarkwould give ``priority'' to discussions of an eight-point Canadianplan for narrowing the differences, but he acknowledged the plancontains the provisions already rejected by the administration.   Still, he asserted that by airing the problem in Washington hehad advanced Canada's cause on the issue, and he reacted testily toa news conference questioner's suggestion he was returning toOttawa empty-handed.   ``Look it, we're looking at a very complex matter,'' he said.``We're moving it forward, well see what happens. What do you do?Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships? Or do you activelywork as I've been doing to persuade Americans of the value andlegitimacy of the Canadian position.''   ``We were nowhere in 1980 and in 1984, and we're slowly butsurely trying to move it along,'' he said.   Mulroney also confirmed reports from the United Nations earlierthis week that Canada would contribute personnel to a multinationalU.N. team that will observe the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Under the plan, Canada would provide about a half-dozen of the50-member contingent, which would observe Soviet compliance withits pledge to pull its estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan byearly next year.   Mulroney said the decision to contribute was in keeping with atraditional Canadian commitment to U.N. peacekeeping operations.   The prime minister used his news conference to take a dig or twoat his political opponents at home.   Asked if Reagan had expressed reservations about U.S.willingness to let Canada buy submarines containing closely heldU.S. nuclear propulsion plants if the socialist New DemocraticParty gains power in the next election, Mulroney said: ``We dealtwith realistic matters.''</TEXT></DOC>
