Brady suggestedon Tuesday that unless the investment community stems the tide ofdebt-financed corporate takeovers the government will step in.   ``It is the finest tradition of our democratic system thatgovernment look first to the people themselves for solutions andonly act _ but do act _ when it is clear the people cannot solve theproblem themselves,'' he said.   Brady told the Senate Finance Committee the new Bushadministration favors eliminating or reducing taxes on corporatedividends as a way to reduce leveraged buyouts or LBOs.   He acknowledged that the federal budget deficit likely precludesthat.   However, his testimony was the clearest indication yet that thenew administration views the multibillion-dollar debt-financedtakeovers as a possible threat to the U.S. economy and is willing totake action to stem them.   ``I have a feeling that we are headed in the wrong direction whenso much of our young talent and the nation's financial resources areaimed at financial engineering while the rest of the world is layingthe foundation for the future,'' he said.   Brady said he would prefer that ``the gladiators in the arena,''the investment bankers, corporate and insurance executives andpension fund managers who issue and trade in high-interest,high-risk junk bonds, come up with evidence that the resulting debtburdens are not harmful, or else that they suggest proposals foraddressing them.   While companies acquired through leveraged buyouts often lack thecash flows to pay interest on the junk bonds that financed thedeals, the bankers, underwiters and fund managers in thetransactions make millions of dollars in fees, Brady complained.   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' hesaid. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the neteffect of LBOs is a snipe hunt, where the new long-term investors,flashight in hand, are left holding the bag.''   Quite a different view was expressed earlier Tuesday bySecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder, who isscheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate panel.   Ruder said on ``CBS This Morning'' that the leveraged buyouts areincreasing ownership of companies by the managers who run them ``andwill make us a more productive economy.''   ``After these buyouts, the managers of the divisions typicallywill be allowed to run the divisions without having to be overseenby top management of the large conglomerate, and they may be verymuch more efficient in their management when they're on their own,''Ruder said.   President Bush, two weeks ago before he took office, ruled outdirect government action to curtail the tide of takeovers but leftopen the possibility of changing the way the tax laws treatdividends and the deductibility of interest payments on junk bonds.   ``There are things you can do in the tax laws,'' he said. ``Ifthere are abuses of our tax laws ... the whole tax law will bereviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''   Brady said any package of tax law changes seeking to discouragedebt financing of takeovers _ or of defenses against them _ bylimiting the deductibility of interest on junk bonds should becoupled with some tax relief on company dividends.   Taxing the interest that companies pay on junk bonds alone, hesaid, ``would simply increase the cost of capital for Americanacquirers by effectively raising their interest rates on anafter-tax basis.''   Since that would not affect the borrowing costs of foreigncorporations, he said, U.S. companies would be at a competitivedisadvantage. Moreover, he said, junk bond issuers would likely findnew mechanisms to avoid taxes on the interest they pay.   ``The long history of attempts to define problems out ofexistence has proved that the definees are more adept than thedefiners,'' Brady said. ``Just as new regulations are written,efforts are under way to render them irrelevant.''   Fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies wereheightened last September when Revco D.S. Inc., the Cleveland-baseddrug store chain, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings afterdefaulting on $700 million in bonds following a $1.4 billion buyout.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Finance Committee's chairman,said the Revco buyout raises concerns about what would happen toother companies in the event of an economic downturn.   ``No one can predict what will happen or when,'' Bentsen said,``but we know what did happen, even in good times, after one LBOtransaction.''   ``I think there's an appetite here to do something,'' Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Meanspanel, told reporters last week.``You get their attention when youtickle the tax code.''</TEXT></DOC>
