Haley, in New York recently to promote the book, said thatalthough the tale was fictional, the workings of the UndergroundRailroad as portrayed in the novella are accurate.   ``If you've researched slavery a lot, as I have for `Roots,' youautomatically know a lot about the phase of it called theUnderground Railroad,'' a network of Quakers, abolitionists, formerslaves and others who set up an escape route for slaves to findtheir way north to freedom, he said.   ``The Underground Railroad could not have worked but for whiteswho were anti-slavery and for blacks who were willing to lay theirlives on the line to help others escape.''   ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' is surprisingly Haley's firstbook since the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Roots,'' published in 1976.It is written in a simple style that lends itself to being readaloud to the family over the course of two or three evenings beforeChristmas.   Haley was asked if he had such an oral tradition in mind when hewrote it.   ``I always write like that, or like to think I do,'' said theauthor, who was born in Ithaca, N.Y., but raised in a small town inwestern Tennessee, and credits the South's great story-tellingtradition as his chief writing influence.   ``I grew up with my grandmother and her sisters sitting on thefront porch in Henning, Tennessee _ population 475 _ after supper,early dark, sitting in rocking chairs, dipping snuff, skeeting snuffat lightning bugs over the honeysuckle vines, and telling stories,night after night after night. So I enjoy writing stories as if Iwere telling them,'' he said in an accent as sweetly Southern as thehoneysuckle he recalled.   It was his grandmother's and great-aunts' storytelling that ledHaley to devote 12 years meticulously tracing his mother's side ofthe family back six generations to a small village in Gambia, WestAfrica. The product of his obsessive labor evolved into ``Roots: TheSaga of an American Family,'' a mix of painstakingly authenticatedfact and imagined fictional detail. It was an instant best seller,and the 12-hour miniseries adapted from the book drew 130 millionviewers, then the largest audience in television history.   Set in 1855, ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' focuses on howFletcher, sent up North to be educated at Princeton University,slowly converts from pro- to anti-slavery after he is befriended bysome Philadelphia Quakers.   Why did Haley choose to make the hero of his tale a wealthySouthern white instead of, say, a slave or freed black man?   ``If you're going to tell the story of the Underground Railroad,you can tell it from any number of points of view. ... I wanted toshow Fletcher's mind change,'' he said. ``A black perspective wouldbe one thing from the very beginning, and that would be to get free.A white mind would go from being in a white world and a whiteperspective to turning 180 degrees to get to where Fletcher got.''   ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' was first conceived as anovelization of the Christmas television special that was broadcastDec. 11: ``Roots: The Gift,'' featuring Kunta Kinte, Fiddler andother characters from the book and miniseries. However, thescreenwriters' strike earlier this year prevented Haley fromcollaborating with the TV script writer on the project, so hecreated a new cast of characters for a tale set several decadesafter the TV special.   Haley, 67, started his writing career while in the U.S. CoastGuard. He contributed to Readers Digest, Playboy and other magazinesbefore publishing his first book, ``The Autobiography of MalcolmX,'' which sprang out of a series of Playboy interviews Haleyconducted with the civil rights leader.   ``Roots'' catapulted him to fame at age 55, and the authoracknowledged that celebrity has its price. Four plagiarism suitswere filed against him (one was settled out of court and threeothers dismissed), and he is so in demand for speaking engagementsthat it's difficult for him to find time to write.   ``Still,'' he asserted, ``when I talk about the negatives, I'mtalking about at best 10 percent. Ninety percent of it's got to bebeautiful. To this day people come up to me on the street, everyrace imaginable, and say `Thank you.' That's holy. You can't topthat.''   To escape the steady stream of phone calls and speech requests,Haley tries to book passage on a cargo ship roughly four times ayear, spending a month or more writing 12 to 14 hours a day.   He has spent the last several voyages working on a host ofprojects. Haley hopes ``Henning,'' a book of memoirs of his youth inTennessee, will be out next year, followed by ``Madame C.J.,'' anaccount of C.J. Walker, who became the first woman in America toearn $1 million. She was a black woman who sold hair preparationsfor black women.   One might assume that the author of a Christmas tale would haveplans for a a traditional holiday to be spent with family andfriends. But Haley expected Christmas Eve to find him scribblingaway aboard a cargo ship.   ``When I publish a book, that's Christmas,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions Jan. 6-8</NOTE></DOC>
