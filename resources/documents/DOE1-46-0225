The focus ison the Concurrent-Read Concurrent-Write Parallel Random Access Machine(CRCW PRAM), a highly parallel model in which several synchronous processorscommunicate by means of shared memory cells that all processors can access.Any number of processors may simultaneously access the same memory cellfor the purpose of reading or writing a value. The input to such a machineis placed in shared memory, or distributed among the local memories ofthe processors. When the number of processors is fixed, the power ofthe CRCW PRAM depends on two resources: the number of shared memory cells,and the method of write-conflict resolution. The latter is used to decidethe outcome in the case that several processors attempt to simultaneouslywrite different values into the same shared-memory cell. The resultsdescribed here show lower bounds which separate the power of machineswith different write-conflict resolution methods in the case when thesize of shared memory is kept small relative to the number of processors,and when the size of shared memory is unbounded. Many of the resultsare extended to the case where processors are allowed the power of makingprobabilistic choices. Algorithms that allow a weaker machine to simulateany computation of a more powerful machine are given, and proved optimal.</TEXT></DOC>
