That humbling thought cuts the tension traditionally surrounding auto labor negotiations here. Growing imports and the breakdown of cross-industry labor patterns have reduced the economywide importance of the talks at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., bargaining once closely scrutinized for signs of a walkout-triggered recession or of wage-fueled inflation.    But that doesn't mean this year's ceremonies in Detroit are irrelevant -- only that they've taken on a different relevance. Rather than a direct economic effect, many observers say the bargaining has symbolic significance, as an indicator of how American industry can resolve labor-management differences and enhance competitiveness, and whether unions can attain meaningful job security.    It won't be that big a deal in terms of overall macro impact,&quot; says Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist with PNC Financial Corp. of Pittsburgh. &quot;But the other segments of the manufacturing industry will look at this to see what the auto industry is able to accomplish.&quot;    It is still too early to determine the likelihood or the dimensions of a strike after the contracts expire Sept. 14. It's been more than a decade since the industry has seen even a two-week work stoppage. Analyst predictions this time, range from no walkout to a two-month confrontation.    Traditionally, the UAW picks one company as a &quot;target.&quot; That decision is expected today. The union focuses its efforts at that company, reaches a contract (sometimes after a strike) and gets a similar pact without a strike at the other company.    But tradition may suffer, mainly because of wide differences between the two auto makers. The most popular scenario among speculators within the companies and outside is: The UAW picks Ford as the target because high profits and healthy sales make Ford more vulnerable to a strike and less averse to a rich settlement. Also, Ford uses fewer workers than GM to make each car, so it can better afford strong job guarantees -- the union's stated top priority. But the struggling GM will balk at the Ford pact, and some creative bargaining takes place or a strike at the No. 1 auto maker ensues.    Veteran negotiators, however, scoff at such &quot;logic,&quot; noting that bargaining often takes on a life of its own, and last-minute twists can surprise even the most informed insiders.    Projections of potential damage vary. Data Resources Inc. says a simultaneous 60-day walkout at GM and Ford would drag third quarter GNP growth down to 0.7% from 1.3%, and force a 1.3% decline in the fourth quarter compared with potential 3.3% growth. Laurence H. Meyer andamp; Associates in St. Louis says a 45-day strike at GM would take fourth quarter GNP growth down to 1.3% from 3.2%. But Mr. Hoffman of PNC Financial doubts that even a strike through the end of October would slow growth by more than 0.6%.    A limited strike targeted at key plants -- a strategy the UAW used for a week against GM in 1984 -- would buffer the impact. A strike against a second company in Canada, where the Canadian Auto Workers union is bargaining independently this year for the first time, could broaden the damage. The CAW has indicated it will target a different auto maker than the UAW, and it has a wider selection. Chrysler Corp. is negotiating in Canada this year although its U.S. contract doesn't expire until 1988.    But whatever happens, the auto industry's ability to sock the economy has dropped since 1970, when a 67-day strike at GM knocked the nation back into a recession for several months. Auto production now employs only 0.8% of the work force, compared with 1.2% a decade ago, and the Big Three's combined market share has eroded from virtual control to roughly two-thirds. Besides, the auto makers have diversified their supply base, and could continue during a North American strike to get some cars from Japan, Korea, Mexico and Germany.    Bloated inventories would also dampen the fallout from a strike. Most analysts estimate that, despite a heavy consumer incentive campaign, published Big Three fourth quarter production schedules are far too optimistic for the current car market. &quot;My scenario is for a reduction in the schedules either through a strike or voluntary action,&quot; says John Qualls, an analyst at Monsanto Corp., a major auto industry supplier. &quot;I don't care if there's a strike or not.&quot;    The greatest potential impact of the bargaining wouldn't be from a strike anyway, but from the settlement ultimately reached. Most recent big labor contracts granted small wage increases or actually extracted cuts. So far this year, pay increases are running at a moderate 3%. Many economists think the GM and Ford agreements -- traditionally trend-setters -- could usher in a new era of steady pay hikes. &quot;We are at a critical juncture now for wage settlements,&quot; says Marvin Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank.    But the auto negotiations may not have much inflationary impact. UAW leaders have made it clear that money isn't their top priority this time around. And a ripple effect would be small, as even auto parts companies represented by the UAW, such as Toledo, Ohio-based Dana Corp., no longer follow the Big Three contracts.    The biggest significance of the talks then, may be hints for grappling with competitiveness. &quot;These negotiations could be an important part of the answer to the question, 'How are we going to achieve productivity growth?'&quot; says Mr. Meyer. &quot;What we're seeing is an attempt to get more flexibility from unions to allow cost reductions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
