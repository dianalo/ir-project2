(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Barely more than three years ago, theWilliams Companies and career pipeliner Roy Wilkens decided to takea risk in the fledgling technology of fiber-optic communications.   Overnight, Wilkens went from being president of a successfulpipeline company to a dingy basement office surrounded by cardboardboxes, where he had only six employees. At first, he didn't evenhave a telephone.   ``My God,'' Wilkens said he thought to himself. ``What have I gotmyself into?''   Although it didn't look that way at first, he and the companywhose fortunes had been tied almost exclusively to the cyclicalfates of the energy industry were about to leap to light speed.   The new technology allows strands of optical glass as thin ashairs, encased in underground cables, to carry huge volumes ofinformation via bursts of laser light.   Comparing the quality of fiber-optic transmissions to regulartelephone lines, Wilkens said, is like comparing a compact disk to a78-rpm record.   The absence of noise from radio frequency and electromagneticinterference means both voice and computer data can be digitalizedand sent long distances in less time for less money.   Wilkens, 45, was president of Williams Pipe Line, a subsidiary ofthe Williams Companies, when the company first began exploring newuses for its out-of-service petroleum pipelines in 1985.   At the same time, regional telecommunications companies weretapping Williams' pipeline-building expertise for fiber-optic cable.   Someone suggested Williams could run fiber-optic cables throughits old pipelines.   ``That's how we really stumbled into the business,'' Wilkenssaid. ``We decided to go ahead and make that move and not look back.... We moved into it very quickly and we were extremely successful.''   The parent company quickly invested $200 million in thefiber-optic system. The National Society of Professional Engineersselected the company's 3,800-mile network as one of the outstandingengineering achievements of 1986.   By the end of 1987, when the Williams Telecommunications Companymerged with LDX Net, Inc., to become Williams TelecommunicationsGroup, it had more than 5,000 miles of fiber-optic line.   At the end of 1987, the telecommunications company's annualizedrevenues had reached $109 million from an annual rate of $8 millionat the beginning of that year.   WTG surged into profitability this year well ahead ofexpectations, with a third-quarter operating profit of $5.3 millioncompared with an operating loss of $7.8 million in the third quarterof 1987.   WTG will complete construction of its own fiber optic cable toNew York next month to replace a line it had been leasing.   The company is expanding from Chicago to New York by purchasing a400-mile fiber-optic line and constructing a 500-mile segment,pushing its total to more than 6,000 miles.   ``We found some difficulty in selling to major corporations whenyou really don't own and control your own network,'' Wilkens said.``It's a very real advantage. A lot of people say 40 percent of allcommunications traffic comes into and goes out of New York.''   WTG boasts it is the first network to offer highly reliablefiber-optic communications capability from New York to Los Angelesand San Francisco.   Wilkens said it means his company has joined the big leagues withAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co, MCI Communications Corp. and U.S.Sprint Communications Corp.   ``We, all of a sudden within 36 to 40 months, have gone from thepoint of `Let's see if we can get into this business' to being thefourth network,'' Wilkens said from the company's new high-tech,high-style corporate headquarters overlooking downtown Tulsa.   WTG sells capacity both to other communications companies and toprivate businesses, but plans to expand its commercial sales efforts.   ``Of the Fortune 2,000 companies, we're into half of them. Of theFortune 100 companies, we're into half of them,'' Wilkens said.``For a little Tulsa company to go into those major corporations andto sell them services is not an easy task.   ``Almost every single major carrier in the country uses us, withthe exception of ATandamp;T,'' Wilkens said. ``And if you look at most oftheir network maps and the marketing literature that they put out,they show their fiber-optic network, which is our fiber-opticnetwork.''   Wilkens said his company had a leg up on the industry because itknew how to build underground pipelines across country. It wasfamiliar with the environmental restrictions, the negotiations forright-of-way, and the need to avoid areas where constructionactivity could cause line breaks.   Earlier this year, WTG opened a futuristic $2.4 million controlcenter in Tulsa that monitors 11,000 miles of fiber lines for afive-member consortium called the National TelecommunicationsNetwork.   The customized system provides constant information about theperformance of the network and its dozens of repeater stations. Thecenter keeps in constant contact with a force of 200 technicians whopatrol the lines.   Wilkens said the company is proud of its reliability, whichapproaches 99.999 percent.   ``That's one way we're trying to differentiate ourselves in themarketplace,'' Wilkens said.   Reliability is crucial for customers who count on digitaltelecommunications to do banking, schedule airline flights, operatecar telephones, order catalog merchandise and dispatch truckerscross-country.   Wilkens said competition following the breakup of ATandamp;T has madeit all possible.   ``I think if the industry stayed regulated the way it was, therewas no big need to try to develop technologically the revolutionthat we're seeing, the information society, the information age,''Wilkens said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 31 - Jan. 1</NOTE></DOC>
