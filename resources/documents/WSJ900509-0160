Here come the truck-trains.   The trucking industry plans to begin campaigning soon forapproval to use larger truck sizes and weights, including100-foot triple-trailer rigs that conjure up images of smalltrains rolling on the nation's highways.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They'll have to put on a caboose and a rear brakeman,&quot;jokes James Bartley, executive director of the NationalIndustrial Transportation League, a shippers' group.   Truckers, promising shippers big productivity gains, saythe larger vehicles will help counter higher taxes and otherrising costs by reducing the number of cabs and driversneeded. &quot;You can be damn sure that the question of larger andmore efficient trucks is high on our productivity hitparade,&quot; says Thomas J. Donohue, president of AmericanTrucking Associations, Alexandria, Va.   Truckers see an opportunity to push for super trucks whenCongress, which could prod states to ease barriers, fashionsa new highway bill in the next 18 months. Meanwhile, theyawait the release in coming months of studies expected toshow that the long truck combinations can operate safely andsave shippers money.   But the prospect of trailers strung together in trucktrains is already generating loud complaints. The AmericanAutomobile Association vows to fight the bigger trucks, which&quot;would put the average automobile driver at increased risk,&quot;says George Viverette, the AAA's director of highwaytransportation. &quot;I don't see why our members should have toshare the roads with these big trucks.&quot;   Others argue that it defies common sense to squeeze largertrucks onto increasingly congested highways. And theyquestion the wisdom of making trucks so much more efficientthat they attract more freight to the highways fromrailroads.   &quot;The trucking strategy is 180 degrees opposite of what wethink the nation's transportation policy should be,&quot; saysBrent Blackwelder, vice president for policy of Friends ofthe Earth. He argues that railroads use less energy andcreate less pollution than trucks to carry comparable loads,without adding to highway congestion and deterioration.   Some state highway officials aren't enthusiastic abouttrucks getting bigger and heavier. &quot;Truckers aren't payingtheir full share of the damage they now do to the roads,&quot;says Howard Yerusalim, Pennsylvania's transportationsecretary. A spokesman for the Illinois TransportationDepartment says the state &quot;doesn't have the financialresources to deal with the additional damage that would becaused by heavier trucks.&quot;   Railroads, whose freight business already is dwarfed bythe trucking industry's, are banding together to block thesuper trucks. They are striking alliances with environmentaland road-safety groups, arguing that consumers will be thelosers if the big trucks roll.   Railroad officials worry that the bigger trucks willderail their recent success at winning some freight businessfrom the highways. By stacking two containers in speciallow-slung cars, railroads have cut costs enough to capturemore than $100 million a year in freight shipments fromtrucks along the nation's busiest long-distance freightroutes.   &quot;The playing field has tipped substantially in favor ofthe railroads in long-haul, high-density, east-west freightlanes,&quot; says John Larkin, an analyst at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons,Baltimore. But longer rigs, Mr. Larkin adds, would tip theplaying field back in the other direction.   Not every railroad executive is worried about biggertrucks. &quot;I don't think that will make or break us,&quot; says DrewLewis, chief executive officer of Union Pacific Corp., addingthat railroad service improvements and cost-cutting measureswill mean more to rail freight levels.   Truckers want to operate triple 28-foot trailers anddouble 48-foot trailers on interstate and other majorhighways nationwide. Some Western states and Easternturnpikes now allow the longer rigs, but truckers generallyare limited to double 28-foot trailers and single 48-foottrailers.   Truckers say the bigger rigs will reduce their costs byone-third. The ATA says one soon-to-be-released study willshow that use of the longer trucks on major roads around thecountry will cut U.S. transportation costs about $4.4 billiona year.   Such savings are important to truckers, who face theprospect of higher federal fuel taxes for road repairs whenCongress crafts highway legislation next year. In addition,trucking companies are looking for productivity gains tooffset state tax increases and the costs of meeting newemission standards.   Mr. Donohue, the ATA president, says the longer rigs alsohave environmental benefits: Because they lower the number oftrucks on the roads, they reduce energy use, air pollutionand highway congestion. More axles to carry the load alsowould mean less road wear, he says.   Mr. Donohue denies that heavy trucks aren't paying theirfair share for the damage they cause to highways, and hebristles at railroad lobbying efforts to drive up truck taxesand block increases in truck size. &quot;If I find them walking onour lawn all the time, I will turn on the sprinklers,&quot; saysMr. Donuhue, who threatens to lobby for an end to variousfederal subsidies that benefit the freight railroads.   The trucking industry is lining up its allies. Max Klotz,manager of permits of the Oregon Transportation Department,says Oregon has permitted triple 28-foot trailers on majorhighways for the past 20 years. &quot;Their safety record is verygood,&quot; he says. Gordon Kinch, team leader of legislativeaffairs at James River Corp., a paper company, says he favorsallowing longer rigs to cut shipper costs and hold downprices to consumers.   But not everyone is sure the economic benefits outweighthe possible social costs. &quot;When I put my economist hat on, Isay let's opt for larger trucks,&quot; says Bernard La Londe, atransportation and logistics professor at Ohio StateUniversity. But he admits having different thoughts when aspeeding 18-wheeler cut him off on the interstate. &quot;Thetrucker is often a bully,&quot; says Mr. La Londe. &quot;I would behesitant to give truckers an opportunity to be twice as big abully.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
