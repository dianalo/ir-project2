Requests must include the amendmentnumber identified in this final rule. Persons interested in being placedon a mailing list for future rulemaking actions should request a copy ofAdvisory Circular 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System,which describes the application procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The rulemaking process that led to promulgation of the final anti-drugregulation began in late 1986. On December 4, 1986, the FAA issued an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (51 FR 44432; December 9, 1986).The ANPRM invited comment from interested persons on drug and alcohol abuseby personnel in the aviation industry. The ANPRM also solicited commenton the options that the FAA should consider to protect and to maintainaviation safety in light of any drug and alcohol use in the aviation industry.On March 3, 1988, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)(53 FR 8368; March 14, 1988) that analyzed the comments submitted on theANPRM and set forth proposed regulations for comment by interested persons.The FAA received over 900 comments in response to the ANPRM and the NPRM.The FAA also held three public hearings across the country on the proposedregulations contained in the NPRM. Each hearing was recorded by a courtreporter and the hearing transcript was placed in the public docket forthe rulemaking.The FAA issued the final anti-drug rule requiring certain aviation employersand operators to develop and to implement an anti-drug program for employeesperforming specified aviation activities on November 14, 1988 (53 FR 47024;November 21, 1988). After the final rule was issued, the FAA continuedto review the timeframes and implementation schedules contained in thefinal anti-drug rule. The FAA became aware of various practical implementationquestions and issues as a result of the agency's responsibility to provideguidance on rule compliance to the industry. Also, representatives of aviationorganizations and employers subject to the final rule expressed concernabout certain procedural aspects of the final anti-drug rule. These entitiesmaintain that the timeframes in the final rule for program submission arenot realistic in light of the complexities of the final rule and that severaldetailed requirements of the final rule should be clarified or modified.These basic issues were addressed generally by the commenters in the priorrulemaking action, but the process of actually developing an anti-drugprogram has increased the awareness of the impact of certain detailed portionsof the final rule. Thus, these issues and the concerns expressed to theFAA are not unique nor are they new issues being raised for the first time.Several issues identified by the FAA are reflected in a formal petitionsubmitted by the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) and the RegionalAirline Association (RAA). A copy of the petition is available for reviewby interested persons in Docket No. 25148. The petitioners jointly requestthat the FAA extend the effective date of the final rule as it appliesto required testing of contract employees. The petitioners suggest thatthis additional time should be used by the industry and the FAA to fullyexplore the most effective methods for including contract employees inan anti-drug program. The petitioners ask that the FAA reconsider whethercontractors may file their own drug testing plans directly to the FAA forapproval. The petitioners also request that the FAA defer testing of employeeslocated outside the territory of the United States indefinitely. Underthe final rule, testing outside the United States must be conducted unlessit would violate the laws of a foreign country or the foreign governmenthas objected to the application of the final rule within its jurisdiction.The petitioners suggest that testing outside the United States should besuspended until DOT, the Department of State, and foreign governments haveconsidered and discussed the international implications of the final rule.The amendments contained in this final rule address, among other things,the request of ATA and RAA in their petition to revise the final anti-drugrule. With respect to the issue of testing contractor employees, theseamendments, as discussed in more detail below, extend the compliance datefor testing contractor employees and permit contractors to submit plansdirectly to the FAA. Before the rulemaking petition was received, the FAAdetermined that these amendments were necessary. For this reason, and becausethis rulemaking action addresses all issues raised in the petition submittedby ATA and RAA, the FAA determined that publication of the petition inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> is unnecessary and would unduly delay this rulemakingaction.The FAA believes that these actions are fully responsive to the concernsraised in the petition. Nevertheless, the FAA is aware that the industry'sexperience under this rule may result in the identification of other issuesthat may need to be addressed to facilitate the effective and efficientimplementation of anti-drug programs. The FAA intends to schedule periodicmeetings to receive comments and recommendations regarding implementationof the final anti-drug rule. In this regard, representatives of DOT, includingpersonnel from the FAA, have attended several meetings in the past fewmonths sponsored by ATA and RAA to discuss rule implementation issues.Information obtained at future meetings or experience gained by the FAAand the industry may result in further modifications of the final anti-drugrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Amendments</ITAG>The first and most crucial issue being amended by this final rule is extensionof the timeframes by which employers must submit an anti-drug plan to theFAA for approval. Representatives of aviation organizations and employersmaintain that the administrative and logistical problems related to developmentand submission of an anti-drug plan are much greater than anticipated.The FAA agrees. In light of the significant amount of work associated withdevelopment and planning of an effective and comprehensive anti-drug program,the FAA is convinced that the existing timeframes are unrealistic. TheFAA believes that effective implementation of an employer's or an operator'santi-drug program will be much easier if additional time is given to theseentities to develop the anti-drug program.Although the FAA is restructuring the schedule for developing and submittinganti-drug plans to the FAA, the date by which the employer's approved anti-drugprogram must begin has not been changed. Thus, the date by which drug testingwould begin pursuant to the final rule remains the same. The commentersdo not express the same concern regarding the date that testing must beginas has been expressed regarding development and submission of an anti-drugplan. The FAA believes that additional time for development of an anti-drugplan that is unique to each affected employer and operator will lead tomore effective and more efficient implementation of the anti-drug program.In this amendment, the FAA is adding 120 days to the time period by whichemployers and operators must submit an anti-drug plan to the FAA for approval.This amendment correspondingly reduces, by an equivalent time period, theinterval between approval of an anti-drug program and implementation ofthat program. For example, in the final anti-drug rule, Part 121 and largePart 135 certificate holders were given a 120-day period for plan submissionand a 180-day period after program approval to implement drug testing,a total of 300 days for these portions of the overall schedule. This amendmentprovides a 240-day period for program submission and a 60-day period toimplement the approved program, or an identical 300-day total period.As a result of amending the plan submission date for these employers, theinterval between program approval and initiation of all types of drug testsis substantially shortened. Hence, the FAA is deleting the requirementthat these entities begin preemployment testing not later than 10 daysafter approval of the employer's anti-drug program by the FAA. These employersnow will implement preemployment testing at the same time that all othertesting begins as required by the final anti-drug rule (on or about December16, 1989). This will permit Part 121 and large Part 135 certificate holdersto implement their approved anti-drug programs in an efficient and uniformmanner. The FAA is adding a similar extension of time in other sections of thefinal anti-drug rule that address the dates by which other employers andoperators must submit anti-drug plans to the FAA for approval. The amendmentcorrespondingly reduces the interval between program approval and implementationof the program. The FAA believes that extending the time period by which employers andoperators must develop and submit a plan to the FAA for approval will greatlyenhance the quality and coverage of an employer's anti-drug program. Yet,at the same time, the goal of implementing a drug testing regimen and providingeducation and training on drug use and abuse to employees will not be delayed.In addition to delaying the date by which plans must be submitted to theFAA for approval, the amended schedule creates a distinction with respectto individuals who are directly employed by an affected employer and thoseemployees who provide sensitive safety- or security-related functions pursuantto a contract with the covered employer. The FAA firmly believes that contractoremployees performing sensitive safety- or security-related functions foran employer or an operator should be tested. However, the FAA also believesthat delaying the date by which testing of these employees must begin wouldhave the salutary effect of allowing employers and operators to gain usefulexperience in implementing anti-drug programs for their own employees beforeaddressing the added complexity and responsibility of testing contractoremployees. The FAA reconsidered the timeframe for including contractor employees inan employer's anti-drug program and the issue of whether contractors couldsubmit anti-drug plans directly to the FAA for approval. Because of thesignificant administrative and logistical difficulties associated withincluding contractor employees in an employer's anti-drug program, theFAA is revising the final rule to give employers additional time regardingtesting of contractor employees. As a result of the amendment, an employer's initial anti-drug program needonly specify testing for direct employees of the employer. An employer'santi-drug program must be submitted and testing of the employer's directemployees must begin not later than the dates contained in this final rule.However, testing of contractor employees would not be required until 360days after testing is initiated for direct employees under that employer'sapproved anti-drug program. Therefore, Part 121 certificate holders andPart 135 certificate holders employing more than 50 covered employees arepermitted to use contractor employees, even if these employees are notcovered by an FAA-approved anti-drug program, for an additional 1-yearperiod after initial implementation of the employer's anti-drug program.A similar extension applies in the case of Part 135 certificate holdersthat employ 11 to 50 covered employees, Part 135 certificate holders thatemploy 10 or fewer covered employees, and operators as defined in the finalanti-drug rule. Under the provisions of the FAA's final anti-drug rule, contractors wererequired to come under the ``umbrella'' of a covered employer's anti-drugprogram. The NPRM implied that contractors could submit anti-drug plansdirectly to the FAA for approval. In the final anti-drug rule, that sectionwas amended so that contractors were required to be part of one coveredemployer's program for whom the contractors provided covered services.However, at both the NPRM and the final rule phases of this rulemaking,the ultimate obligation to ensure that direct or contract employees arepart of a drug testing program always has rested with the certificate holderor the operator subject to the final anti-drug rule. At the final rulestage, only the method by which contractor employees would be includedin an approved plan was revised. DOT and the FAA are fully aware of theadministrative and logistical complexity of this requirement and addressesthat issue in this document. In addition to extending the timeframe for including contractor employeesin an approved anti-drug program, the FAA is amending the final anti-drugrule to permit contractors and consortiums (which may be comprised of acombination of contractors, employers, or operators) to submit plans directlyto the FAA for approval. These provisions are designed to facilitate implementationof the final anti-drug rule in the area of testing contractor employeesand to permit employers and operators subject to the final rule to jointogether to take advantage of economies of scale. Thus, Appendix I to Part121 contains a provision that enables repair stations certificated by theFAA to submit anti-drug programs directly to the FAA for approval. TheFAA also is including a provision that would enable contractors that donot hold a Part 145 certificate and consortia of contractors or employersto submit a plan directly to the FAA for approval. Unlike certificatedrepair stations, some companies that provide employees to assist air carriersin the screening of persons and property are not certificated nor regulateddirectly by the FAA. Similarly, consortia that may develop to help smallor remote aviation employers in developing and implementing anti-drug programsare neither certificated nor regulated by the FAA. However, after reviewof the final anti-drug rule and concerns expressed by the aviation community,the FAA believes that it would be wise to permit these entities to submitplans directly to the FAA for approval. These entities will be permittedto submit anti-drug programs to the FAA on a form and in a manner prescribedby the Administrator so that an appropriate mechanism and procedures canbe developed for these types of entities. The FAA is adding a provisionto the final anti-drug rule to provide such a mechanism for these entities.The FAA believes that the delay in requiring contractor employees to becovered will provide sufficient time for many contractors to develop theirown comprehensive anti-drug programs. Contractors actually may benefitfrom this delay since Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holders will havesubmitted anti-drug programs to the FAA and will have implemented approvedanti-drug programs. Aviation contractors will gain valuable experienceregarding the development of anti-drug programs and the administrativerequirements from employers who have implemented anti-drug programs. This final rule amendment also addresses the issue of the impact of thefinal rule on persons outside the United States. Under the terms of thefinal rule, the appendix is not effective until January 1, 1990, with respectto any person for whom a foreign government contends that application ofthe appendix raises questions of compatibility with that country's domesticlaws or policies.After the final anti-drug rule was issued, the Department of State sentdiplomatic notes to foreign governments regarding the requirements of thefinal rule. In response, 12 foreign governments objected to the potentialimpact of the final rule within their jurisdiction and contended that thefinal rule is incompatible with the foreign country's laws or policies.DOT and the FAA recognize that government-to-government discussion is critical,and has already begun in some cases, to reach permanent resolution of anyconflict between the final rule and a foreign country's laws or policies.In their petition, ATA and RAA state that a foreign country's silence orfailure to communicate its objections should not be construed as tacitapproval or affirmative consent to the final rule in that country. Becauseof the added complexity of this rule in an international arena, DOT andthe FAA believe that the timeframe set forth in the final rule may be insufficientto ensure that each foreign government understands the significance ofthe final anti-drug rule and initiates appropriate governmental actionto notify the U.S. government of its position regarding the final rule.Neither DOT nor the FAA wish to place a U.S. air carrier in an untenableposition while this government-to-government process is developing. Therefore,the FAA is deleting the affirmative obligation for a diplomatic responsefrom a foreign government and is extending the effective date of the finalrule, as it may apply outside the territory of the United States, to January1, 1991. DOT and the FAA believe that this action is necessary to avoidinconsistent or ineffective implementation of the rule by air carriersand to provide additional time for government-to-government discussionsin this area. Moreover, the FAA believes that this extension will enableU.S. air carriers to obtain administrative expertise with their domesticanti-drug programs before implementing similar programs, and assuming thesignificantly greater logistical and administrative burden, of testingcovered employees in foreign countries. The FAA also is making several minor, editorial changes in the final anti-drugrule. These are technical changes to reflect the FAA's original intentregarding the final rule or to correct errors that occasionally occur duringa rulemaking project of this magnitude. For example, the term ``grounddispatcher'' is being deleted from Appendix I to Part 121. That term wasintended to ensure that individuals performing aircraft dispatcher duties(e.g., preparation of a dispatch release or document, flight release form,load manifest, or flight plan) would be included in an employer's approvedanti-drug program despite the title that was given to that employee orthe fact that the employee did or did not hold an aircraft dispatcher certificateissued by the FAA. The focus of the FAA's final anti-drug rule has always been on the ``employer''or ``operator.'' Thus, the provision that specifies sanctions for a certificatedemployee's refusal to submit to a drug test is amended to delete referencesto FAA inspectors and law enforcement offices. As amended, the specifiedsanctions apply only when an employee refuses to submit to a drug testin accordance with the appendix when requested by the employer or operator.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reason for no Notice and Immediate Adoption </ITAG>These amendments to the final anti-drug rule are needed immediately todelay the compliance dates specified in the final rule. Under the implementationschedule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 21, 1988, certain aviation employerswould have been required to submit an anti-drug program to the FAA forapproval by April 20, 1989. It is necessary to delay implementation ofthe final anti-drug rule due to the administrative and logistical problemsassociated with implementation of comprehensive anti-drug programs. TheFAA believes that delay of the date by which plans must be submitted tothe FAA, and certain other provisions intended to relieve difficult burdenson employers, will lead to efficient and effective industry anti-drug programs.For these reasons, notice and public comment procedures are impracticable,unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Moreover, the FAA hasdetermined that good cause exists to make this final rule effective inless than 30 days. In accordance with the Regulatory Policies and Proceduresof the Department of Transportation, an opportunity for public commenton the final rule is provided.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment </ITAG>In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12291, the FAA reviewedthe costs and the benefits of the final anti-drug rule issued on November14, 1988. At that time, the FAA prepared a comprehensive Regulatory ImpactAnalysis of the final anti-drug rule. The FAA included that analysis inthe public docket. The FAA also summarized and analyzed the comments submittedby interested persons on the economic issues in the final rulemaking documentpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 21, 1988. This final rule extends certain compliance dates and revises the methodby which certain entities may be covered by anti-drug programs approvedby the FAA. This document also makes minor editorial changes and clarificationsto the final anti-drug rule to aid an employer's development of a programand implementation of an approved anti-drug program. These issues wereaddressed in the prior rulemaking actions that led to promulgation of thefinal anti-drug rule. This rulemaking action does not change the basicregulatory structure and requirements promulgated in the final anti-drugrule. Therefore, the FAA anticipates that there would be little or no costassociated with the extension of certain compliance dates and the technicalamendments of this final rule. In addition, there would be little or nochange in the benefits identified in the final rule. Thus, the FAA hasdetermined that revision of the comprehensive Regulatory Impact Analysisfor the final anti-drug rule is not necessary and preparation of a separateeconomic analysis for this final rule is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires a Federal agency to reviewany final rule to assess its impact on small business. The amendments containedin this final rule extend certain compliance dates, provide an additional,but not required, method by which some contractors may submit anti-drugprograms directly to the FAA, and make certain editorial or clarifyingchanges to the final anti-drug rule. In consideration of the nature ofthese amendments, the FAA has determined that this final rule will nothave a significant economic impact, positive, or negative, on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Statement</ITAG>This final rule contains an amendment that extends the date by which anemployer must ensure that employees outside the United States are in compliancewith the final rule issued on November 14, 1988. The amendment providesthat Appendix I to Part 121 is not effective with respect to any employeelocated outside the territory of the United States until January 1, 1991.Thus, the FAA has determined that this final rule will not have an impacton trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or on foreignfirms doing business in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Approval </ITAG>The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the final anti-drug rule,issued on November 14, 1988, previously were submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) for approval in accordance with the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. OMB approved those requirements on February 2, 1989.Because this final rule does not amend the recordkeeping and reportingrequirements of the final rule, it is not necessary to amend the priorapproval received from OMB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>The final rule adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, the FAA has determined that this final rule does not havesufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a FederalismAssessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>This final rule extends certain compliance dates and revises the methodby which certain entities may be covered by anti-drug programs approvedby the FAA. This document also makes minor editorial changes and clarificationsto the final anti-drug rule to aid an employer's development of a programand implementation of an approved anti-drug program. These issues wereaddressed in the prior rulemaking actions that led to promulgation of thefinal anti-drug rule. This rulemaking action is necessary to facilitateimplementation of the final rule issued on November 14, 1988. This rulemakingaction is intended to clarify the requirements of the final anti-drug ruleand to improve administration of the rule. Pursuant to the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAAcertifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. In addition,the final rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more and will not result in a significant increase in consumerprices; thus, the final rule is not a major rule pursuant to the criteriaof Executive Order 12291. However, because the rule involves issues ofsubstantial interest to the public, the FAA determined that the final ruleis significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Departmentof Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 2, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>14 CFR Part 61 Air safety, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Airmen, Aviationsafety, Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Pilots, Safety, Transportation.14 CFR Part 63 Air safety, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airmen, Airplanes, Aviation safety,Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Safety, Transportation.14 CFR Part 65 Air safety, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airmen, Aviation safety, Drugabuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Safety, Transportation.14 CFR Part 121 Air carriers, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Airmen, Airplanes,Aviation safety, Drug abuse, Drugs, Narcotics, Pilots, Safety, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendments </ITAG>Accordingly, the FAA amends Parts 61, 63, 65, and 121 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, and 121) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 61_CERTIFICATION: PILOTS AND FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS</ITAG>1.
