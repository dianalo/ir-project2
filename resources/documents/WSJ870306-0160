IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST SN EUROPMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)PETROLEUM (PET) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oil consumption by Western industrial nations won't grow much above 1% this year, according to the latest monthly oil market report of the Paris-based International Energy Agency.    The forecast, released today, represents a significant drop from 1986 growth of 2.5%, and complicates the struggle of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain world oil prices around $18 a barrel in the face of resistance by oil companies.    Oil industry officials say that in addition to tightly limiting production and fixing crude oil prices, OPEC now must consider reducing output further and fixing the prices of refined products sold by its members.    &quot;There is no such thing as trying a little,&quot; said Constantine Fliakos, senior oil analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;There has to be an all-out effort to bring production in line with demand and keep it there.&quot;    Today's IEA forecast, which analysts said was anticipated, confirms the suspicions held by many in the oil industry that last year's oil price collapse pushed many companies to stock up on cheap crude and oil products, creating a false bulge in the growth of oil consumption.    Mr. Fliakos and other analysts say that although OPEC output is reliably reckoned to have dropped in the past month by almost one million barrels a day to around 15.8 million barrels a day, it may have to stay there, or drop further, for the rest of the year to stabilize oil prices.    Yesterday in Vienna, Austria, OPEC's secretariat said the cartel's 13 members already are producing &quot;well below&quot; their official overall ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day. For their part, a number of senior OPEC officials interviewed in the past three days asserted that the group's strategy, for March at least, is to bite the bullet and accept a fall in production rather than lower prices.    One senior OPEC minister -- who, like three interviewed previously, asked not to be identified -- said: &quot;We have no choice but to say no. The slightest suggestion of compromise can substantially weaken oil prices.&quot; Among other things, OPEC has postponed a meeting of its oil-production monitoring group in Vienna to April 15 from April 2, in order to discourage any suggestion of a lack of resolve among its members to resist.    OPEC officials say they are confident that prices will stabilize enough by the end of March to ease the pressure on weaker producers.    Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based trade newsletter Petrostrategies, said that if OPEC adheres to its strategy, production could fall to 12 million barrels a day by the end of March.    He and others say that the length of time that OPEC needs to overcome the challenge by the oil companies depends on the extent to which it can force them to deplete their stocks of stored oil. It also depends on how the companies evaluate OPEC's resolve.    &quot;If the market is weakening today, it isn't because OPEC got the demand and supply numbers wrong. This weakness is caused by a massive stock draw induced by industry's crisis of confidence over OPEC's ability to stick to the (production restraint) deal,&quot; says Nordine Ait-Laoussine, president of Nalcosa, a Geneva-based oil consulting firm. He once represented Algeria as a senior OPEC official.    Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport and Trading Co., estimated at a news conference yesterday that primary stocks, which usually are drawn down by 1.5 million to two million barrels a day in the first quarter of the year, have been drawn down at a rate of nearly 3.5 million barrels a day so far in the first quarter. Additionally, he estimated that secondary stockpiles have been falling by about 500,000 barrels a day.    Mr. Holmes said he believes the drawdown in primary stocks in the last week of February was &quot;quite enormous&quot; at around five million barrels a day. But, he stressed, it wasn't certain that the exceptionally high number for the most recent week will continue.    To boost oil company confidence in OPEC resolve, some in the industry argue that the cartel must do more than just resist pressure to reduce prices.    Charles Maxwell, an analyst with the firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York, said one problem is that while OPEC countries have since February stopped selling crude oil at free market prices in favor of official prices, many among them, including Kuwait, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates, continue to sell substantial amounts of fuel oil, gasoline and other products from their own refineries at competitive market prices.    Another problem, he argued, is the skewed official price structure, which assigns less-attractive prices to such producers as Qatar and Nigeria. This, in effect, turns these countries into &quot;involuntary swing-producers&quot; whose output sinks as clients go to others within OPEC with more enticing official prices.    &quot;Will these countries accept their new role? Will they patiently await OPEC's eventual pricing changes? Or will they set their own fixed prices?&quot; Mr. Maxwell asked.    Beyond technical problems such as these, there are political problems among OPEC members posed by the inordinate drop in their revenues. &quot;We wonder how long a politically set oil price can be maintained against increasingly savage economic attack,&quot; Mr. Maxwell said. </TEXT></DOC>
