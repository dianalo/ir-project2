For example, &quot;I would like to see everybody whose responsibility is geared primarily to North America -- whether they're hourly workers or managers -- either they all make bonuses,&quot; or none makes a bonus, Elmer W. Johnson, executive vice president, said. The current bonus system may serve &quot;the incentive purposes for which it is designed,&quot; he added. &quot;But it falls short of what I hope for in the future.&quot;    Mr. Johnson's remarks came just two days after Ford Motor Co. drew fire from the United Auto Workers union for its announcement that top Ford executives pocketed record bonuses last year.    Ford hourly workers received profit-sharing checks that averaged about $3,700, while GM hourly workers received no profit sharing even though the No. 1 auto maker's top 5,000 executives, including Mr. Johnson, divided about $157 million in stock awards. GM's proxy statement, giving details of individual salaries and bonuses paid to top executives, is due out today.    Reforming the GM bonus system wouldn't necessarily mean a smaller bonus pool, Mr. Johnson said. &quot;Not necessarily, not if you unleash the productivity I think is possible&quot; by solidifying labor-management teamwork through a common bonus formula, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
