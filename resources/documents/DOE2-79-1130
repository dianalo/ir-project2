Although progress has been made in cancer treatment,there has been little improvement in real survival time for people whodevelop the major forms. Therefore, the need to prevent cancer is paramount.The greatest chemical exposures and risk of associated preventable cancersare found in the workplace, but generally environmental exposures receivegreater public attention. Chemical causes of cancer have been identified,and in some cases decades have passed before controls have been adequatelyinstituted. Some companies show a high regard for worker health, whileothers may minimize or misrepresent the hazards to exposed workers. Medicalpersonnel receive relatively little education in the recognition of industriallyrelated diseases. Workers are often unaware of their risks or are trappedin jobs because of economic necessity, and government has been slow toregulate, in part because of lobbying efforts. Experience has shown thatwhen chemicals are regulated relatively soon after they are identifiedas hazardous, lives are saved, and the industry is economically healthy;however, when regulation is delayed, thousands of people die unnecessarily,and the cost to industry and society are phenomenal. Society has theopportunity to apply the knowledge learned from these experiences aswe address current problems of chemical pollution.</TEXT></DOC>
