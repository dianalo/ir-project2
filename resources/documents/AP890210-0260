(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has chargedformer White House budget director Bert Lance and a Calhoun companywith defaulting on loan payments to a now-defunct Tennessee bank.   The U.S. District Court suit seeks $1.5 million from Lance andthe Kris Company Inc. It alleges that Lance and the companydefaulted on payments to the United American Bank of Knoxville forfour separate loans and renewal agreements dating to late 1981.   The suit, filed in Rome, was made public Thursday after U.S.District Judge Harold L. Murphy denied a request from thegovernment's lawyers to keep it secret for 20 days. The governmentargued that media attention would adversely affect the FDIC'sability to collect the money.   Lance said Friday he had not seen a copy of the suit.   ``However, I feel I must comment to the extent that over thecourse of the last four years I have made significant payments andgood-faith efforts to pay all my debts in full,'' he said.   ``I have not made any efforts to compromise any debt for lessthan the full amount. But because of certain disputes about theapplication of payments, I have been unable to come to anyagreement. Those disputes were not about my willingness to pay anydebt that was due in full.''   He added, ``I consider it unfortunate that the FDIC took theaction it took, but I remain determined to stand up for the rights Ibelieve I ought to have. I am hopeful we can resolve our differencesas soon as possible.''   Lance declined to talk about the Kris Company Inc., saying it wasa ``personal company.''   The Tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of UnitedAmerican Bank six years ago, and the FDIC later took over variousUAB loans, including the ones to Lance and the Kris Company.   The FDIC suit listed four notes with principal balances of$348,816, $196,656, $227,531 and $474,664, totaling $1,247,667. Thegovernment also is seeking accrued interest as of Jan. 20 and perdiem interest since then.   Lance and the company were given 10 days to pay the $1,509,000before the amount is increased by 15 percent for attorney's fees,FDIC lawyers said.   The lawyers also asked Murphy for control of the real propertyused to secure the loans, but no action has been taken on thatrequest.   Lance was a Calhoun banker and former commissioner of the GeorgiaDepartment of Transportation when he was named White House budgetdirector after fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was elected president in1976. He resigned in September 1977 amid allegations about hisbanking practices.   Three years ago, Lance agreed to pay a fine of $50,000 and notwork at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting fromcharges of bank fraud brought against him by the federal Office ofthe Comptroller of the Currency.</TEXT></DOC>
