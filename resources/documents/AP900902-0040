And what's that? Back to EllisIsland.''   The Chrysler Corp. chairman led the drive to raise $345 millionto restore Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, which wasrededicated in 1986.   Next Sunday, Iacocca will help dedicate the new Ellis IslandImmigration Museum and designate the 27-acre site on the island inNew York Harbor as a national shrine.   Immigrants have learned hard work and sacrifice are keys to abetter life, Iacocca said.   Iacocca, an immigrant's son, said the gateway to the UnitedStates for 17 million Americans can give the country a needed boostof morale. But the Ellis Island celebration will be low-key _dinner and speeches _ compared to the hoopla of the statue fouryears ago.   ``One guy called me and said, `What are you, crazy? Why are wehaving a black-tie dinner? Is that in keeping with the immigrantexperience?' I said, `What do you want, for us to come in rags?'''Iacocca said. ``I just thought it would be a nice touch, and you dohonor to the fact that we made it _ we can even afford to rent atux.''</TEXT></DOC>
