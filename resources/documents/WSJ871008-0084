SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BAC JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   BankAmerica Corp. said Japanese investors agreed to purchase $350 million in notes and preferred stock, a long-negotiated transaction that will modestly lift its depleted capital, but on onerous terms.    BankAmerica also said it plans to raise $75 million in additional capital in an offering through its London-based merchant bank. BankAmerica said it will complete the Japanese pact this month, but that completion of the $75 million financing is &quot;an open question.&quot;    As previously reported, BankAmerica has been courting the Japanese for months, and final terms show how the new investors drove a hard bargain. The Japanese are receiving premium interest rates as well as conversion rights and warrants which, if exercised, would give them about 7% of BankAmerica's common shares.    But BankAmerica's current stock price makes it unlikely that the investors would take a voting position in the company anytime soon.    Separately, an audit of BankAmerica's foreign exchange operations found $26 million in unreconciled trading accounts at least a year old, part of which may be charged against future earnings, bank officials said    Regarding the Japanese-investors transaction, aBankAmerica spokesman said, &quot;The essential terms of thetransaction haven't changed from those initially proposed,&quot;but declined further comment.   A banking executive familiar with the transaction, however, said: &quot;It is a deal that the Japanese pretty much dictated. It is so expensive that I cannot imagine we would ever do this again. You cannot continue to put a capital structure together that is so much more expensive than competitors.&quot;    The transaction further exemplifies deepening Japanese investment in major U.S. financial institutions, and is particularly humbling for BankAmerica. With the transaction, the unprofitable banking company finds itself turning to a nation that it extensively helped to rebuild after World War II.    BankAmerica said the investors include financial institutions and insurance companies. It declined to name them, although Japan's largest companies, including DaiIchi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank and Mitsubishi Bank are believed to be involved.    The Japanese are purchasing $250 million principal amount of 12-year, floating-rate subordinated notes, and $100 million in convertible preferred stock. The preferred carries a 9.5% dividend, while the notes are priced at 125 basis points above the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor. A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.    By comparison, investment bankers estimate, such top-rated banking concerns as J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. might be able to raise funds at below Libor, if, as BankAmerica has done, the offering was sweetened with common-stock warrants.    The notes carry warrants convertible for 10 years at $17.50 a share, into a total of about 6.3 million BankAmerica common shares. The preferred stock is also convertible at $17.50 a share, or about 5.7 million shares. BankAmerica had 156 million common shares outstanding at June 30.    The entire $425 million, including the London offering, would be included in BankAmerica's primary capital, which at June 30 totaled $7.53 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, BankAmerica common stock rose 25 cents to close at $11.50 a share.    While added to make the securities more attractive, the warrants, priced at about 50% more than the existing stock price, are considered speculative by investment bankers, who said warrants are more often priced at 25% to 30% of market.    But banking and Wall Street sources said BankAmerica was in a position where it couldn't offer the warrants more cheaply. Earlier this year, it rejected a $22-a-share takeover offer from First Intersate Bancorp. In rejecting the bid, BankAmerica valued it at just $17 a share, and said its own plans made the company much more valuable.    If the company had set a warrant price that essentially &quot;admitted to the world that the real value of our shares, some time from now, is less than what we valued the (First Interstate) offer to be,&quot; a banking executive said, &quot;it would create some potential legal exposure and certainly some embarrassment.&quot;    The warrants are convertible, however, at more than BankAmerica's book value at June 30 of $14.48 a share, which means they won't dilute the interests of other shareholders. The June 30 book value was down from $21.84 a share at March 31, however, depressed largely because of a $1.1 billion second-quarter charge for troubled Third World debt.    Japanese banks said to be involved in the transaction couldn't be reached for comment about the agreement.    The remaining $75 million to be sold is also in the form of floating-rate notes due 1999, and with the same Libor-related rate. The notes include warrants to purchase an additional 1,875,000 BankAmerica shares.    BankAmerica's Bank of America International Ltd. merchant bank is leading the $75 million underwriting, while BankAmerica is issuing the remaining securities directly without outside underwriters. </TEXT></DOC>
