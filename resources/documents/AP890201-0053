Owners have until April 30 to apply for the $265 payment, HomeSecretary Douglas Hurd said Tuesday. The sum is based on the pricesuch rifles fetched at auction before parliament took up the measurein September 1987.   Under the new law, the penalty for possessing a prohibited weaponis up to five years in jail or a $3,500 fine.   The Firearms (Amendment) Act was introduced after Michael Ryankilled 16 people as he strolled through the small town of Hungerfordin August 1987 before taking his own life. It bans the private useof high-powered self-loading rifles like the Kalashnikov, which Ryanused in the massacre, and other weapons including short-barreled,smooth-bore guns.   Fully automatic weapons are already prohibited in Britain.   The government payment applies to owners who acquired the newlybanned weapons before September 23, 1987.   Calls in the United States for greater restrictions on the saleof semi-automatic weapons have increased since last month'sshootings in a Stockton, Calif., elementary school yard.
