Gordon Crovitz</HL><DD> 08/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><TEXT>   Next week, fund-raiser Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell plans to &quot;take a pilgrimage to go see my contributors, tell them my views on the new peace plan for Nicaragua, and if it's as bad as it looks, raise money for informational advertisements.&quot;    The news that Mr. Channell will resume his pro-Contra activities came in a visit yesterday with Wall Street Journal editors. He had shied from publicity since independent counsel Lawrence Walsh got him to plead guilty last May to a tax violation. Mr. Channell, accompanied by his lawyer, Alexia Morrison, would not talk about his controversial plea bargain or his cooperation with Mr. Walsh's investigation of others, including Lt. Col. Oliver North. He doesn't want anything he says to be used against him by Mr. Walsh, who hasn't yet recommended a sentence, which could be up to five years and $250,000.    Mr. Channell and publicist Richard Miller pleaded guilty to using a charitable group to raise funds for &quot;non-humanitarian&quot; purposes, citing arms purchases for the Contras. Tax experts criticized the plea because no one had ever been charged under the theory that buying arms was a violation. The Internal Revenue Service and the head of the tax division at the Justice Department said that if Mr. Channell had done anything wrong, it was at most a civil violation. Assistant Attorney General John Bolton said Mr. Walsh's accusation was based on a &quot;wacko legal theory.&quot;    Mr. Channell has also been accused of using the profits from the Iran arms sales to buy advertisements for pro-Contra congressional candidates and of personally profiting at the expense of rich contributors and the Contras themselves. But who is Spitz Channell? Is he a desperado or, like Ollie North, will he someday be viewed as a national hero?    He told the story of the making of a modern political activist, who found great success soliciting wealthy contributors who shared his hopes for a tough foreign policy. Mr. Channell, now 42, started out as a low-level campaign worker. He began working on campaigns for conservative Republican and Democratic candidates in the late-1970s. In 1979, political tactician Tony Dolan had Mr. Channell try his hand at soliciting donations. Mr. Channell says that after he raised $30,000 in one night, &quot;Tony said, 'What's wrong with you? It's magic,' and offered me any title I wanted. I told him I wanted an office as far away from his as possible and $25,000 a year.&quot; He raised more than $2 million in 1979 and 1980. He later formed several related organizations, which became the leading private fund-raisers for the Contras. His groups raised more than $7 million for pro-Contra advertising and medical and military supplies.    He says he still hopes to &quot;be part of the re-creation of a bipartisan foreign policy.&quot; Foreign policy, he says, &quot;has a frazzled existence, with radicals on both sides grabbing for the mikes.&quot; He emphasized that many of his stable of 100 major contributors were former Democrats, mostly Texans. Along with several letters of thanks from President Reagan, yesterday he also displayed a letter of appreciation from Democratic lobbyist Penn Kemble.    &quot;How does the '60s song go about the age of Aquarius? We had all the planets in line,&quot; Mr. Channell said. &quot;We had Cuba, then Nicaragua, a president who said he would roll back communism, Ollie North in 1986 making more than 100 addresses around the country.&quot; As a result, &quot;People were giving, with conservatives thinking that Ronald Reagan was really going to do it, that this was a unique moment and if they gave enough money, it would all work out.&quot;    He says the &quot;political machine of the '80s&quot; is built on &quot;getting to people who already want to give, who think politics is a big part of American life,&quot; but who aren't satisfied contributing to political parties. He says he finds possible contributors by reading Palm Springs Life and Texas Business Magazine. &quot;Then I have to figure out which du Pont is the real conservative,&quot; he says.    Three contributors to his National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty who donated funds for supply planes and other materiel testified before the Iran-Contra panel in May. Colorado brewer Joseph Coors, New York investor William O'Boyle and Ellen Garwood, widow of an official of the Truman State Department, said they contributed because they feared Congress would fail to keep the Contras adequately supplied.    When Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.) said Lt. Col. North and Mr. Channell were a one-two punch, Mrs. Garwood cut him off. She said, &quot;They didn't have to do a one-two punch with me because they knew I was already so interested, and so eager to help to defend our country that all they had to do was ask me.&quot;    Mr. Channell says that the contributions &quot;ended up as one ball of wax, with the same contributors for humanitarian and non-humanitarian aid.&quot; He also said that he had started his fund-raising several months before he met Lt. Col. North in the spring of 1985, which is contrary to the suggestion by some members of the Iran-Contra congressional panel that they started as a team.    He said the newspaper article that first put him in the public eye last December was entirely false. The Lowell (Mass.) Sun reported that $5 million from the Iranian arms sale was funneled through conservative groups, including Mr. Channell's, to help pro-Contra congressional candidates. &quot;This story came right out of Mars,&quot; Mr. Channell said. He said he was as surprised as everyone else to learn of the arms sales to Iran.    Mr. Channell's unusual guilty plea means that doubts about his possible other criminal activity may never totally disappear. He may have to wait until Mr. Walsh brings charges against Lt. Col. North before he is sentenced. In the meantime, Mr. Channell will be back on the phone, spreading the gospel, trying to put wealthy contributors and the Contras back together again.    ---   Mr. Crovitz is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. </TEXT></DOC>
