The large Indian market for soft drinks has been supplied by local bottlers selling local products with such brand names as Thumbs Up and Campa Cola.    PepsiCo said the joint venture will make an initial investment of $17 million in an industrial facility to make soft-drink concentrate, along with fruit juice concentrates and snack foods from locally acquired produce, in the state of Punjab. The locally made soft drinks will be distributed through franchised bottlers.    In return for the entry into the country, PepsiCo agreed that the venture would export from the venture five times the value of its imported components. If that condition isn't met, PepsiCo won't be able to repatriate royalties and profits.    PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., also won't hold a majority stake; it will own 39.9% of the venture and a corporation owned by Punjab state and the Indian central government will have a 36.1% stake. The Tata Group, India's largest industrial corporation, will own 24%.    PepsiCo officials acknowledge the agreement's terms are harsh in comparison with similar accords PepsiCo signed to gain entry into the Soviet Union and China. &quot;We're willing to go so far with India because we wanted to make sure we get an early entry while the market is developing,&quot; said Robert H. Beeby, president and chief executive officer of the company's Pepsi-Cola International. &quot;The Indian middle class is beginning to emerge, and we see that as a big growth market.&quot;    India has a population of 800 million people, and Indians drink about 2.4 billion bottles of name-brand soft drinks a year. Although that's a small number on a per-capita basis, industry analysts estimate the market is growing at 20% annually.    Pepsi's plant will make enough concentrate for 1.2 billion bottles of Pepsi a year. PepsiCo said it hasn't set a date when it would start selling the soft drink there.    Another reason for PepsiCo's move clearly was competition from its big rival, Coca-Cola Co., which is aggressively pursuing markets in China and the Soviet Union. &quot;We found that it is better to {enter} a market with or ahead of Coca-Cola,&quot; said Mr. Beeby. He said Pepsi entered China a couple of years after Coke, and about 10 years ahead in the Soviet Union. &quot;Viewing them {Coca-Cola} as our lead competitor, if we get into a big market ahead of them we are that much better,&quot; he said. &quot;That was another reason for making such an attractive agreement with India.&quot;    Officials at Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, had no comment on PespsiCo's move.    Coca-Cola left India after the government demanded that the company turn over its secret soft-drink formula to an Indian company and transfer other technical know-how to local management. The Indian government also announced that the soft-drink giant, along with other foreign companies, couldn't own more than 40% of their Indian subsidiaries, a ruling that was tantamount to diminishing the companies' control over their Indian operations.    PepsiCo also operated in India for about two years in the mid-1950s. A company spokesman said the company left the country because &quot;we were unable to build a viable business there.&quot;    Mr. Beeby said the company doesn't see any problem meeting the condition that PepsiCo must generate exports five times the value of imports to the joint venture. PepsiCo will have to import some parts of the concentrate to preserve the secrecy of its soft-drink formula. But by agreeing to this ratio, PepsiCo has voluntarily agreed to a limit on its soft-drink sales in India, if it doesn't meet that condition.    To ensure that it meets the export-import condition, PepsiCo said the joint venture will build modern food processing plants that will use locally grown tomatoes, pears, apples, mangoes and other fruits to make fruit-juice concentrates, mainly for exports. The venture also will establish an agricultural research center to develop high-yield crops and disease-resistant seeds.    PepsiCo, whose soft-drink sales account for roughly a third of its business, is a leading processor of snack foods, and it also owns restaurant chains.    The joint venture will create 1,000 jobs and give work to about 15,000 farmers. </TEXT></DOC>
