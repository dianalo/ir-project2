KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Transportation Safety Board onWednesday urged the auto industry to redesign seat belts so theycan easily be used by children, short adults and the elderly.   In a letter to 33 American and foreign auto companies, the boardsaid the change would increase seat-belt use and promote safety. Ithopes to persuade automakers to install an adjustable upper anchorfor the shoulder strap portion of the seat belt in all new cars.   European automakers generally offer adjustable upper anchors,but the system isn't generally available in the United States, theboard said. Earlier this year, the boardincluded the proposedchange on a ``most wanted'' list of safety recommendations.   The board said in its letter that serious accident injuries mayresult from improper seat-belt use because of an inability toadjust them to the size of the occupant.   ``Improper use can degrade the belt's ability to prevent seriousinjury and, given certain accident circumstances, may introduce thepossibility of serious belt-induced injuries,'' the letter said.   Thomas Carr, director of safety for the Motor VehicleManufacturer's Association in Detroit, said the group and itsmember auto companies would ``discuss and consider'' therecommendation.   Carr agreed that if seat belts are more comfortable there areless objections to using them.   ``The only issue is to what extent people might misadjust belts,not putting them in the best position because it's a lot morecomfortable,'' he said, contending that seat belts now arepositioned ``to the advantage of the vast majority of thepopulation.''   A 1988 NTSB report noted that the most common mistake inseat-belt use, especially in seating children, was to place theshoulder portion of the belt behind a child's back. Parentscommonly do that because they can't adjust that part of the beltand don't want it to come in contact with a child's face or neck.   ``Short adults also share the fear of neck injury from anill-fitting shoulder harness and also may be tempted to misroutethe belt,'' the board said. ``Another form of misuse noted was theplacing of the shoulder portion of the belt under the arm, arouting that can have fatal consequences.''   The board said that while the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration declined to require a redesign to make shoulderharnesses adjustable, it encourages manufacturers to do sovoluntarily.   Ford, the board said, plans to introduce the device in somefour-door models next spring and will phase it in forher car, lighttruck and van models over the next two to three years.   General Motors provides the adjustable anchor only on thefour-door Oldsmobile 98 and the four-door Buick Park Avenue, itsaid.   The board said that because of mandatory seat-belt laws in 36states, seat-belt use increased from 14 percent in 1984 to 50percent this year.   In a 1988 study of serious accidents, 80 percent of 214front-seat occupants wearing properly adjusted seat belts sustainedonly minor or moderate injuries or no injuries at all, the boardsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
