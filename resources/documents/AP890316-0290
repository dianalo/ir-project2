U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.3 percent ofcapacity in February, down 0.2 percentage point from January, whenthe 84.5 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade, theFederal Reserve Board reported.   At the same time, the pace of industrial production held steadyin February after 12 months of steady advances, the central banksaid in a second report Thursday.   Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson told reporters thefigures are ``consistent with the notion of some moderation in theeconomy'' although it would be premature to say they signal a trend.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocksrose 20.17 points. Traders took the reports as evidence thatinflationary pressures in the economy were easing but analysts werecautious about reading too much into one month's figures.   ``The markets can take some comfort that the edge is coming offthe burst of momentum through the end of the year in the economy,''said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.   But he continued, ``There is no suggestion ... that the softnessspells recession or even major slowdown at this time, nor that itwill flow through and arrest the upward momentum of inflation.''   The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fearthey will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,leading to shortages and price increases.   Just Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that while expansionand improved efficiency ``are forestalling widespread bottlenecks,materials and product prices are edging up, albeit sporadically andat an uneven pace.''   Concern about inflation heightened last month after the LaborDepartment reported that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in Januarywhile wholesale prices shot up 1 percent. That prompted the Fed tointensify its year-long campaign to push up interest rates in aneffort to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation.   Economist James Annable of the First National Bank of Chicagosaid that while the Fed can ``breath a sigh of relief'' atFebruary's industrial production and capacity use reports, there areother, more convincing indications that the economy continues toexpand at a moderately strong pace.   ``What we've got in this economy is continued movement forward,''Annable said. ``The news for financial markets is good but in factit certainly doesn't mean that the Federal Reserve is going to easeoff.''   Last month's operating rate of 84.3 percent was up from 82.4percent a year earlier. At manufacturing plants, the operating ratedipped 0.2 percentage point to 84.6 percent.   Use of capacity for production of durable goods, ``big ticket''items expected to last three or more years, stood at 83.4 percent,down from 83.5 percent in January. The rate for non-durable goodswas 86.3 percent in February, down from 86.7 percent in January.   The rate at motor vehicle and parts plants was down 1.2percentage points to 84.9 percent last month. It was the secondstraight monthly decrease after steady advances from August toDecember.   The auto industry has been plagued by slow sales so far thisyear, as higher interest rates and declining demand set in.   The operating rate at utilities rebounded to 82.9 percent inFebruary, up 1.4 percentage point from January when activity wasdepressed by relatively warm weather.   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, theoperating rate also fell 1.4 percentage point to 81.1 percent inFebruary, as coal production continued to fall from its high levelat the end of last year.   Production, meanwhile, held steady in the manufacturing sector inFebruary after a 0.7 percent gain in January.   Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.2 million unitslast month, down from the 7.5 million pace of January.   Output at mines and oil wells dropped 1.8 percent in Februaryafter falling 1.9 percent in January. Production at utilities rose1.9 percent, after dropping 0.5 percent during the unusually mildtemperatures of January.</TEXT></DOC>
