The marketing agreement and orderare effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, asamended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 60 handlers of Southeastern potatoes under thismarketing order, and approximately 150 potato producers. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR121.2] as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. Themajority of the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.The budget of expenses for the 1989-90 fiscal year was prepared by theSoutheastern Potato Committee (committee), the agency responsible for localadministration of the order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculturefor approval. The members of the committee are handlers and producers ofSoutheastern potatoes. They are familiar with the committee's needs andwith the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area andare thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget wasformulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affectedpersons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the committee was derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of potatoes. Because that rateis applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate whichwill produce sufficient income to pay the committee's expected expenses.The Southeastern Potato Committee met on April 20, 1989, and unanimouslyrecommended a 1989-90 budget of $11,000 and an assessment rate of $0.01per hundredweight. The proposed budget and assessment rate are the sameas last year's. Major expense items include committee staff salaries, travelexpenses, and utilities. The recommended assessment rate, when appliedto anticipated fresh market potato shipments of 700,000 hundredweight,would yield $7,000 in assessment revenue which, when added to $4,000 fromreserve funds, would be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. While this proposed action would impose some additional costs on handlers,the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Someof the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costswould be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketingorder. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This action should be expedited because the committee needs to have sufficientfunds to pay its expenses. The 1989-90 fiscal period begins on June 1,1989, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment forthe fiscal period apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscalperiod. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommendedby the committee at a public meeting. Therefore, it is found and determinedthat a comment period of less than 30 days is appropriate because the budgetand assessment rate approval for this program needs to be expedited. Thecommittee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which areincurred on a continuous basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 953 </ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Potatoes (Virginia and North Carolina).For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that andSection;953.246 be added as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 953_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN SOUTHEASTERN STATES</ITAG>1.
