The committee voted 8-6 for a Democratic motion recommendingSenate rejection of Siegan, and minority Republicans said theirfight for the University of San Diego professor was over.   President Reagan nominated Siegan for the 9th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals which covers nine Western states.   After the party line vote on Sen. Edward Kennedy's motion for anegative recommendation, Republicans failed in a move to have thenomination reported to the Senate without recommendation. The votewas 7-7, with Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., voting with the GOP.   Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized Siegan's lack of experience beforefederal courts _ he had one case three decades ago _ and said thenominee practiced ``judicial activism in the extreme.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., defended Siegan, saying hisjudicial philosophy ``should not be the single criteria'' forjudging him. He added ``nothing about his character, experience orbackground'' should stop him from serving on the court.   Siegan wrote that the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawingschool segregation was correct, but decided by faulty reasoning.   The landmark ruling, Siegan said, should have been based on theright of black students to travel to the schools of their choice.His critics said this would have left students at the schoolhousedoor, without guaranteeing a seat inside.   Siegan said prayer in schools could be constitutional, althoughthe Supreme Court has said otherwise. He wrote that equal weightshould be given to property rights and human rights. And he saidframers of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees basic freedoms,never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined by theSupreme Court.   Siegan, 63, tried to save his troubled nomination at a hearinglast February, when he told the committee he would follow SupremeCourt precedent, and not his own feelings, if approved by theSenate.   ``If a case comes where I can't observe the law of the land Iwould resign,'' Siegan said then. ``There are times I will rulecontrary to my own feelings.''   The 9th circuit has jurisdiction over Alaska, Arizona,California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.</TEXT></DOC>
