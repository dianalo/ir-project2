I think all those things will becaught up in our new anti-drug program. ... Yes, I think the federalgovernment has a role in it.''   He said, ``There will be federal money and I wish we had more,''but he did not elaborate.   The District of Columbia has recorded 80 homicides so far thisyear, compared with 51 by Feb.21 a year ago. The city's 372homicides last year set a record for the city. About 80 percent ofthe deaths were drug-related, according to a study released lastweek.   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, said last weekhe was worried about the proliferation and use of firearms inWashington and elsewhere but still wanted to be a president who``protected the rights of people to have arms.''   He said that states should enforce existing laws and that hewould strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic weapons. .   ``It's hard, very hard to do, but that's my position and I'm notgoing to change it,'' he said in an interview with several reporterslast Wednesday.   ``Look at the laws on gun control, and you'll find where some ofthe more stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are procuredthere and weapons are used there. So, you're not going to get me todo anything other than to say I'm very concerned about this.''   The district has one of the nation's toughest gun laws.   Dozens of states, as well as Congress, are considering measuresto outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety ofsemiautomatic weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
