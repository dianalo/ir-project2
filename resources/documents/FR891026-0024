Part One contains backgroundinformation that summarizes the major revisions which are being consideredto the May 6, 1987, proposed rule. See 52 FR 16982. It also describes howtoday's proposed rule would relate to the planned amendments to the incineratorstandards that the Agency may soon propose.Part Two describes the alternative approaches the Agency is consideringto address several issues. EPA is requesting comment on these alternativesbecause they differ substantially from the provisions proposed. The Agencywill consider comments on the original proposal as well as on the alternativesdiscussed here in developing final rules for promulgation. Alternativeson which we are soliciting comment are: adding a particulate standard forboilers and furnaces; and developing alternative standards for carbon monoxide(CO) (to limit products of incomplete combustion (PICs)), toxic metals,and hydrogen chloride (HCl). We also discuss in this part revisions beingconsidered to the small quantity burner exemption to make the risk assessmentused to establish the exempt quantities consistent with the assessmentused to establish the metals, HCl, and PIC standards. In addition, we discussin this part an expansion to the definition of waste that would be consideredindigenous to particular types of devices when it is reclaimed. Industrialfurnaces burning indigenous waste solely for reclamation (i.e., not forenergy recovery or destruction) would not be subject to any of the proposedemission standards. Finally, we discuss here the Agency's current thinkingon the applicability of the Bevill exclusion (see RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(A)(i)-(iii)) to residues from fossil fuel-fired boilers, cement kilns, andindustrial furnaces that process ores and minerals, when such devices alsoburn or process hazardous waste.<ITAG tagnum="72">PART ONE: BACKGROUND</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Legal Authority</ITAG>These regulations were proposed under the authority of section 1006, 2002(a),3001, 3004, 3005, and 3007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended bythe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Quiet CommunitiesAct of 1978, the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980, and the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6921, 6924,6925, and 6927.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Overview of This Notice</ITAG>The purpose of this notice is to request comments on various alternativesto the May 6, 1987, proposed rule. The alternative approaches the EPA isdiscussing today may be incorporated in the final rule.In this notice, EPA is considering a number of changes to the May 6, 1987,proposed rule. Several changes are a result of comments received on theproposal. Others result from the Agency's revised risk assessment approach.As a result, EPA is considering: (1) Adding a particulate emissions standardfor boilers and industrial furnaces; (2) alternatives to the proposed carbonmonoxide standard based on risks posed by emissions of products of incompletecombustion; (3) establishing emissions controls for six additional toxicmetals; (4) revising the small quantity burner exemption to base it onan upgraded risk assessment; and (5) expanding the definition of indigenouswaste as it applies to industrial furnaces involved in the reclamationof hazardous wastes.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Relationship of This Notice to the May 6, 1987, Proposed Rule</ITAG>Comments on the alternative approaches discussed in today's notice willbe considered as well as comments on the proposed rule in developing afinal rule for promulgation. The basic methodology for developing the alternatestandards discussed today is the same as used to develop the May 6, 1987,proposal. The conservative Screening Limits discussed today are based onthe principle that ground level concentrations of pollutants emitted froma facility must not result in unacceptable health risk to a maximum exposedindividual. Thus, these Screening Limits are similar in concept to theTier I-Tier III metals and HCl Standards proposed in 1987. The major changein the metals and HCl Standards would be to establish limits based on effectivestack height (i.e., physical stack height plus plume rise) in lieu of thethermal capacity and type of the combustion device. This would result inless over-regulation because the limits would be established as a functionof effective stack height, a key site-specific factor in dispersion ofstack emissions.The risk assessment methodology also remains basically the same as proposedon May 6, 1987. The only change is an upgrading of the air dispersion modelsbased on revisions to EPA-recommended air dispersion models.Finally, we are updating Appendices A (reference air concentrations) andB (risk specific doses) originally published on May 6, 1987, and correctedon July 8, 1987 to reflect current health effects data. Both Appendicesare provided in their entirety as appendices to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Relationship of This Notice to the Planned Hazardous Waste IncineratorRevisions</ITAG>It is EPA's intention to make the standards for burning \1\<NOTE/> hazardous waste as uniform as possible given that the potentialrisks posed are similar irrespective of the type of combustion device.This approach also should be easier for both the regulated community andEPA to implement. Accordingly, the Agency is considering a proposal, whichmay be noticed shortly, to revise the existing hazardous waste incineratorstandards under Subpart O of 40 CFR part 264 to provide controls for PICs,metals, and HCl that are identical to those described in today's noticefor boilers and industrial furnaces.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For the purpose of this notice, ``burning'' in industrialfurnaces includes reduction as well as combustion. As additional information,EPA plans to propose to expand the definition of industrial furnaces in40 CFR 260.10 to include those designated furnaces that engage in any formof thermal processing, not just combustion. Thus, that proposal would includeas regulated industrial furnaces electric arc smelting furnaces processingmetal-bearing hazardous waste to recover metals. The Agency plans to includethat proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice to amend the incinerator standards. Seediscussion in text. The Agency is not including the proposal to expandthe definition of industrial furnace in today's notice because this noticeis considered a supplemental notice to the May 1987 proposed rule, ratherthan a new proposed rule or reproposal.The Agency plans to address in a future rulemaking an issue of particularinterest to owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces; theAgency plans to propose to expand the definition of industrial furnace(which presently applies to only controlled flame devices) to include anyof the currently designated devices that are supplied with heat energyby any means. Thus, for example, electric arc smelting furnaces would beincluded in the definition.<ITAG tagnum="72">PART TWO: ALTERNATIVES BEING CONSIDERED</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Particulate Standards</ITAG>A. Justification for Particulate StandardEPA received numerous comments on the May 6, 1987, proposed rule suggestingthe need for a particulate standard for boilers and furnaces burning hazardouswaste. Many respondents believed that unregulated particulate emissionscould pose a significant threat to human health because toxic metals andorganic compounds may be absorbed onto particulate matter (PM), and becausePM, <T3>per se</T3>, could pose a health risk because the smaller size particlesmay be entrained in the lungs.In light of these comments, EPA is considering establishing a particulateemission standard for boilers and industrial furnaces. Even though we believethat the proposed metals and organic emissions standards would adequatelyprotect public health based on current knowledge about toxic pollutantsand available risk assessment methodologies, we acknowledge that thereare serious limitations to the proposed health-based standards for metals(see section B.3 below). A PM control standard would provide additionalprotection by ensuring that absorbed metal and organic compounds wouldbe removed from stack gases with the collected PM.B. Selection of Particulate StandardEPA is considering limiting particulate emissions from boilers and industrialfurnaces based on the current hazardous waste incinerator standard of 0.08gr/dscf (grains/dry standard cubic foot), corrected to 7 percent oxygen.We are selecting this particulate limit because it would provide a commonmeasure of protection from particulate emissions from boilers, industrialfurnaces, and incinerators burning hazardous waste.We acknowledge that a particulate standard for boilers and industrial furnacesmay be redundant in some cases for a number of reasons: (1) EPA may haveestablished (usually more stringent) particulate standards for the facilityas New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under the Clean Air Act; (2)the States may have established particulate standards for the facilityunder the Clean Air Act's State Implementation Plan (SIP) required to ensurethat the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter isnot exceeded; and (3) the metals and HCl emission standards proposed forboilers and furnaces burning hazardous waste may result in particulateemissions well below 0.08 gr/dscf. We believe, however, that there wouldbe many situations where the standards would not be redundant. As discussedbelow, NSPS standards would not apply to many boilers and industrial furnaces.SIP standards may not apply to many units with relatively small capacity.Finally, many boilers may burn hazardous waste with low levels of metalsand chlorine such that emission controls, if needed, may not lower particulateemissions to 0.08 gr/dscf. Thus, we believe that particulate standard wouldfrequently not be redundant, and where redundant, the additional burdenof compliance, if any, would not be significant.In selecting a particulate standard for boilers and industrial furnaces,we considered the following alternatives:1. <T3>Apply the current NSPS Standard for Steam Generators Burning Waste.</T3>EPA promulgated NSPS for steam generators burning waste with or withoutother fuels that limit particulate emissions from new municipal waste combustors(MWCs) to 0.03-0.04 gr/dscf. (See 40 CFR 60.43(b)). New MWCs would be subjectto this standard because they almost invariably are designed to recoverenergy. Thus, the Agency has, in effect, lowered the 0.08 gr/dscf NSPSpromulgated in 1981 at 40 CFR 60.52 for new solid waste incinerators to0.03-0.04 gr/dscf. Given that EPA based the hazardous waste incineratorparticulate standard on the 1981 municipal incinerator standard (0.08 gr/dscf),it could be argued that the Agency should lower the hazardous waste incineratorparticulate standard accordingly to 0.03-0.04 gr/dscf. This would allowthe Agency to take advantage of advances in the state-of-the-art of particulatecontrol technology. However, as explained in Section B.3., EPA is not preparedto propose to lower the hazardous waste incinerator particulate standardat this time. This issue will be discussed further in the planned revisionsto the hazardous waste incinerator standards.2. <T3>Apply the Applicable NSPS.</T3> Under this approach, the particulatematter NSPS applicable to a source category (e.g., cement kilns) wouldbe applied to all units in that category irrespective of date of constructionor size. (The NSPS as authorized by the Clean Air Act apply only to newunits, and often small-capacity units are exempt.)EPA has promulgated particulate matter NSPS for a number of devices includingboilers; cement kilns; lime kilns; asphalt concrete drying kilns; primarylead, zinc, and copper smelters; and secondary lead and bronze smelters.These standards generally result in particulate emissions concentrationsranging from 0.01 to 0.05 gr/dscf. However, many devices that burn hazardouswaste (e.g., light-weight aggregate kilns) are not covered by NSPS regulations.Therefore, standards would have to be developed for these devices. Developmentof these standards will take a significant amount of time and effort onthe part of the Agency.In addition, the economic impacts of applying the NSPS to existing andsmall devices may be substantial given that the standards were developedto control particulate emissions to the limit of technical and economicfeasibility for new units (without consideration of retrofitting issues.We discuss below, however, that we are beginning an effort to establisha best demonstrated technology (BDT) particulate standard for boilers andindustrial furnaces. In that evaluation, we will consider whether the NSPSrepresent BDT.3. <T3>Apply the Existing Hazardous Waste Incinerator Standard.</T3> We believethat the existing hazardous waste incinerator standard of 0.08 gr/dscf(see 40 CFR 340.342(c)) should be applied to all boilers and industrialfurnaces burning hazardous waste (unless more stringent NSPS or SIP Standardsalready apply to the device). This would ensure that the same interim capon particulate emissions applies to all hazardous waste combustion devicesuntil BDT particulate standards can be developed. The 0.08 gr/dscf standardis readily achievable and should not result in significant economic impacts.Preliminary data indicate that approximately 10-20 percent of boilers andindustrial furnaces burning hazardous waste would be required to upgradeor install particulate control equipment or otherwise reduce emissionsto meet the standard.In addition to providing some control of particulate metals and adsorbedorganic compounds, the 0.08 gr/dscf standard should also ensure that theNational Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulates is achievedin most cases. An analysis of existing sites shows that emissions of particulatesat 0.08 gr/dscf could result in MEI levels of up to 30% of the maximumdaily PM<T2>10</T2> (particulate matter under 10 microns) NAAQS (150 mg/m3). Ifbackground particulate levels at a site are already high (i.e., the siteis in a non-attainment area), however, particulate emissions from the deviceshould be addressed as part of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) (asthey are now for hazardous waste incinerators in particulate non-attainmentareas). Therefore, although the 0.08 gr/dscf standard may not ensure compliancewith the NAAQS in every situation, this issue will be addressed by theSIP since the facility would be, by definition, in a non-attainment areafor particulate emissions.As mentioned above, EPA is undertaking an effort to investigate a bestdemonstrated technology (BDT) particulate standard for boilers and industrialfurnaces burning hazardous waste. (We are also investigating a BDT particulatestandard for hazardous waste incinerators.) Although we believe the proposedmetals and PIC controls provide substantial protection of public health,those risk-based controls have limitations including: (1) Health effectsvia indirect exposure to carcinogens (e.g., deposition of metals and uptakethrough the food chain), ecological effects, and synergistic effects havenot been considered; (2) without adequate health effects data to establishacceptable ambient levels, emissions limits cannot be established (e.g.,we are not proposing emission limits for selenium for this reason); and(3) constituent-specific, risk-based emission limits must be implementedby limiting feed rates, which can be difficult given the variability ofwaste matrices and pollutant concentrations. Given these concerns, we believethat a BDT particulate standard is necessary to adequately protect publichealth and the environment. Once the BDT particulate standard is promulgated(after proposal and opportunity for public comment), the risk-based controlswould be used to supplement the BDT standard on a case-by-case basis toaddress situations where the BDT standard may not be fully protective.We specifically request comment on whether NSPS particulate limits canbe considered BDT. Further, given that time and budget constraints arelikely to limit development of BDT standards for only the primary typesof devices that burn hazardous waste (e.g., oil, gas, and coal-fired boilers,cement kilns, light-weight aggregate kilns), we request comment on howBDT particulate standards can be established on a case-by-case basis duringthe permitting process for other types of devices.C. Implementation of the Particulate Standard1. <T3>Preferred Option.</T3> EPA wants facilities in interim status to complywith the particulate standard as quickly as possible and believes thatit is reasonable to require compliance within 24 months of promulgationof the final rule. Accordingly, the source would have to demonstrate initialcompliance under 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Methods 1-5, within twelvemonths of promulgation. The compliance test must be representative of worst-casewaste-fuel/operating conditions with respect to particulate emissions thatwill occur during interim status. Previous testing under the Clean AirAct could be used to make this demonstration if the operating conditionsmeet the conditions specified above. Final compliance for those sourcesthat are unable to demonstrate initial compliance would be required within24 months of promulgation (whether or not the facility has received a finalRCRA permit). The compliance alternatives are: (1) Modify operations ofthe facility to bring it into compliance (e.g., upgrade air pollution controlequipment); or (2) implementation of closure (under 40 CFR 265.111). TheRegional Administrator could, however, extend the compliance period ifthe owner or operator can show inability to make the required modificationsdue to situations beyond its control, e.g., the required equipment is unavailablefrom vendors within the regulatory time frame. This option is EPA's preferredalternative for implementation of particulate standards.2. <T3>Alternative Options.</T3> EPA is also considering the following alternativeinterim status requirements to bring sources into compliance with the particulatestandard. One alternative would require facilities that cannot demonstratecompliance (within 12 months of promulgation) to submit a compliance planto the Agency within 15 months of promulgation which ensures expedientcompliance (i.e., within 12 months of Agency approval). Another alternativewould require the source to submit a complete Part B, RCRA Permit Application,or to cease burning hazardous waste and complete closure requirements within18 months of promulgation. EPA requests comments on each of these alternativesto implement the particulate standard as quickly as possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Alternative PIC Controls</ITAG>The 1987 proposed boiler and industrial furnace rule would limit flue gascarbon monoxide (CO) levels to ensure that these devices do not emit productsof incomplete combustion (PICs) at levels that could pose unacceptablehealth risk. The Agency discusses here its revised thinking on how bestto establish controls on PIC emissions and we are also considering a proposal,which may be noticed shortly, to apply the revised approach to controlPIC emissions from hazardous waste incinerators as well. We discuss belowthe comments received on the proposed rule and describe the revised approach.A. Comments on Proposed CO StandardThe proposed boiler and industrial furnace rule would have applied thesame CO emissions limits to all boilers and industrial furnaces: a lowerlimit of 100 ppmv over a 60-minute rolling average and a 500 ppmv limitover a 10-minute rolling average. The hazardous waste feed would be automaticallycut off if either limit was exceeded, and hazardous waste burning operationswould have to cease pending review by enforcement officials if the wastefeed were cut off more than 10 times a month. The lower limit of 100 ppmvwas selected as representative of steady-state high efficiency combustionconditions resulting in PIC emissions that would not pose a significantrisk. The higher limit of 500 ppmv was proposed to limit the frequencyof emission spikes that inevitably accompany routine operational transients,such as load changes and start-up of waste firing.Many commenters opposed the proposed CO trigger limits and associated limitson the number of waste feed cutoffs. Principally, commenters objected toone set of CO emission limits applicable to all boilers and industrialfurnaces. Further, they argued that PIC emissions would not be significantif, when the waste feed was cut off, combustion chamber temperatures weremaintained while the waste remained in the chamber. Thus, they argued thatthere was no need to limit the number of waste feed cutoffs.Commenters indicated that several types of boilers and many cement kilnswould not be able to meet the proposed 100 ppmv limit even though hydrocarbonconcentrations would not be high at the elevated CO levels. For example,boilers burning residual oil or coal typically operate with CO emissionlevels above the proposed 100 ppmv limit because of inherent fuel combustioncharacteristics, equipment design constraints, routine transient combustion-relatedevents, requirements for multiple fuel flexibility, and compliance withNO<T2>2</T2> emission standards. Attempts to reduce CO emissions from thesedevices to meet the proposed limits may prove unsuccessful in additionto the possibility of heavy penalties in thermal efficiency if successful.Similarly, industry and trade groups for the cement industry voiced strongopposition to the 100 ppmv limit for cement kilns. These commenters indicatedthat some cement kilns, especially modern precalciners, routinely emitCO above the proposed 100 ppmv limit. In general, commenters indicatedthat while the proposed limits may be appropriate for combustion devicesin which only fuel (fossil or hazardous waste) enters the combustion chamber,they are inappropriate for cement kilns and other product kilns in whichmassive amounts of feedstocks are processed. These feedstocks can generatelarge quantities of CO emissions which are, in large part, unrelated tothe combustion efficiency of burning the waste and fuel. Whereas all theCO from boilers and some industrial furnaces is combustion-generated, thebulk of the CO from product kilns can be the result of process events unrelatedto the combustion conditions at the burner where wastes are introduced.\2\<NOTE/> Therefore, limiting CO emissions from these combustion devicesto the proposed 100 ppmv level may be difficult and not warranted as ameans of minimizing risk from PICs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For example, CO can be generated from the trace levelsof organic matter contained in the raw materials as the materials movedown the kiln from the cold end to the hot end where the fuel and wasteis fired. CO can also be generated by combustion of fossil fuel at thebase of the precalciner, which takes combustion gases from the kiln andheats them further with fossil fuel to precalcine the raw materials beforefeeding into the kiln. Although hazardous waste may not be fired in a precalciner,inefficient combustion of the precalciner fuel will result in high fluegas CO levels.In summary, commenters argued that the proposed CO limits would be difficultor virtually impossible to meet in some cases, and, thus, inappropriategiven that EPA has not established a direct correlation between CO, PICemissions, and health risk.In light of these concerns, commenters suggested that EPA establish COlimits for specific categories of devices based on CO levels achieved byunits operating under best operating practices (BOP). We considered thisapproach but determined that equipment-specific CO trigger limits wouldbe difficult to establish and support and would not necessarily provideadequate protection from PIC emissions. For example, the BOP CO level fora precalcining cement kiln may be 800 ppmv, a level that industry representativesindicate may be typical in some situations for that device. If that COlevel, in fact, results in part from the inefficient combustion of hazardouswaste, PICs may be emitted at levels that pose significant risk. (We note,however, that PIC emissions may or may not be high when CO levels are high.However, in all known instances, PIC emissions are low when CO levels areunder 100 ppmv.)EPA nonetheless believes that the CO limits should be flexible to avoidmajor economic impacts on the regulated community given that we cannotsay that when CO levels exceed 100 ppmv that PIC emissions will always,or even often, result in significant health risk. At some elevated CO level,however, PIC emissions would pose significant risk. Unfortunately, we cannotat this time identify the precise trigger level_the trigger level may varyby type and design of device and fuel mix. Consequently, we have developeda two-tiered approach to control PICs. Under Tier I, CO would be limitedto the 100 ppmv limit proposed in 1987. (See appendix A for backgroundinformation on the basis for the Agency's concern about PIC emissions andthe use of CO to minimize the potential health risk.) Under Tier II, the100 ppmv CO limit would be waived under two alternative approaches: (1)a demonstration that total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions are not likely topose unacceptable health risk using conservative, prescribed risk assessmentprocedures; or (2) a demonstration that the THC concentration in the stackgas does not exceed a good operating practice-based limit of 20 ppmv. Althoughwe prefer the technology-based approach for reasons discussed below, werequest comment on the health-based alternative as well.B. Proposed Tier II ControlsIf the highest hourly average CO level during the trial burn exceeds theTier I limit of 100 ppmv, a higher CO level would be allowed under twoalternative approaches: a health-based approach, or a technology-basedapproach.\3\<NOTE/> We prefer the technology-based approach for reasons discussedbelow. One of the alternatives will be selected for the final rule basedon public comment and Agency evaluation, including a critique by the Agency'sScience Advisory Board (SAB).\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ This two-tiered approach would supersede the approachproposed in 1987 whereby the waste feed would be cutoff within 10 minutesof exceeding a 100 ppmv hourly rolling average CO level and immediatelywhen exceeding a 500 ppmv rolling 10 minute average. We believe that theapproach proposed in today's notice is more environmentally conservativeand supportable in light of commenters' concerns about the technical supportfor the dual range CO limits and averaging periods proposed in 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ EPA's SAB reviewed the proposed PIC controls in the springof 1989 and a final report is scheduled to be available in the fall of1989.1. <T3>Health-Based Approach.</T3> Under the health-based approach to waivethe 100 ppmv CO limit, the applicant would be allowed to demonstrate thatPIC emissions from the combustion device pose an acceptable risk (i.e.,less than 10^5) to the maximum exposed individual (MEI). Under this approach,we would require the applicant to quantify total hydrocarbon (THC) emissionsduring the trial burn and to assume that all hydrocarbons are carcinogeniccompounds with a unit risk that has been calculated based on availabledata. The THC unit risk value would be 1.0andmultiply;10^5 m3/andCx.18;g andrepresents the adjusted, 95th percentile weighted (i.e., by emission concentration)average unit risk of all the hydrocarbon emissions data in our data baseof field testing of boilers, industrial furnaces, and incinerators burninghazardous waste. The weighted unit risk value for THC considers emissionsdata for carcinogenic PICs (e.g., chlorinated dioxins and furans, benzene,chloroform, carbon tetrachloride) as well as data for PICs that are notsuspected carcinogens and are considered to be relatively nontoxic (e.g.,methane, and other C<T2>1</T2> as well as C<T2>2</T2> pure hydrocarbons, i.e., containing only carbon and hydrogen).We adjusted the data base as follows to increase the conservatism of thecalculated THC unit risk value: (1) We assumed that the carcinogen formaldehydeis emitted from hazardous waste combustion devices at the 95th percentilelevels found to be emitted from municipal waste combustors;\5\<NOTE/> and (2) we assumed that every carcinogenic compound in AppendixVIII of Part 261 for which we have health effects data but no emissionsdata is actually emitted at the level of detection of the test methods,0.1 ng/1. Finally, we assigned a unit risk of zero to noncarcinogenic compounds(e.g., C<T2>1</T2>-C<T2>2</T2> hydrocarbons such as methane, acetylene). The calculated unitrisk value for THC is 1andmultiply;10^5 m3/andCx.18;g, comparable to the valuefor carbon tetrachloride.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Because of its extremely high violatility, special stacksampling and analysis procedures are required to measure formaldehyde emissions.Such testing has not been successfully conducted during EPA's field testingof hazardous waste combustion devices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ For additional technical support, see U.S. EPA, ``BackgroundInformation Document for the Development of Regulations for PIC Emissionsfrom Hazardous Waste Incinerators,'' December, 1988 (Draft Final Report).To implement the health-based approach with minimum burden on permit writersand applicants, we have established conservative THC emission ScreeningLimits as a function of effective stack height, terrain, and land use.See appendix B. These Screening Limits were back-calculated from the acceptableambient level for THC, 1.0 andCx.18;g/m3 (based on the unit risk value discussedabove and an acceptable MEI risk of 10^5), using conservative dispersioncoefficients. (We also used those dispersion coefficients to develop alternativeemissions and feed rate limits for metals and HC1, as discussed below.The basis for those dispersion coefficients is also discussed below.) IfTHC emissions measured during the trial burn do not exceed the THC emissionsScreening Limits, the risk posed by THC emissions would be considered acceptable.If the Screening Limits are exceeded, the applicant would be required toconduct site-specific dispersion modeling using EPA's ``Guidelines on AirQuality Models (Revised)'' to demonstrate that the (potential) MEI exposurelevel (i.e., the maximum annual average ground level concentration) doesnot exceed the acceptable THC ambient level.2. <T3>Technology-Based Approach.</T3> Under this Tier II approach, the TierI CO limit of 100 ppmv would be waived if THC levels in the stack gas donot exceed a good operating practice-based limit of 20 ppmv.We have developed this technology-based approach because of concern aboutscientific limitations of the risk-based approach. In addition, the risk-basedapproach could allow THC levels of several hundred ppmv_levels that areclearly indicative of upset combustion conditions.The Agency believes that risk assessment can and should be used to limitthe application of technology-based controls_that is, to demonstrate thatadditional technology controls, even though available, may not be needed.However, we are sufficiently concerned that our proposed THC risk assessmentmethodology may have limitations particularly when applied to THC emittedduring poor combustion conditions (i.e., situations where CO exceeds 100ppmv) that we are considering a cap on THC emissions. Although we believethe development of a risk-based approach is a step in the right direction,we are concerned whether the risk-based approach is adequately protectivegiven our limited data base on PIC emissions and understanding of whatfraction of organic emissions would be detected by the THC monitoring system.Notwithstanding the limitations of the THC risk assessment methodology,however, we believe it is reasonable to use the methodology to predictwhether a technology-based limit appears to be protective. We have usedthe risk assessment methodology to show that a 20 ppmv THC limit appearsto be protective of public health.We discuss below our concerns with the proposed THC risk-based approachand the basis for tentatively selecting 20 ppmv as the recommended THClimit (measured with a conditioned gas monitoring system, recorded on anhourly rolling average basis, reported as propane, and corrected to 7%oxygen).a. <T3>Concerns with the THC Risk Assessment Methodology.</T3> Our primaryconcern with the risk assessment methodology is that, although it may bea reasonable approach for evaluating PIC emissions under good combustionconditions, it may not be adequate for poor combustion conditions_whenCO exceeds 100 ppmv. The vast majority of our data on the types and concentrationsof PIC emissions from incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burninghazardous waste were obtained during test burns when the devices were operatedunder good combustion conditions. CO levels were often well below 50 ppmv.Under Tier II applications, CO levels can be 500 to 10,000 ppmv or higher(there is no upper limit on CO).\7\<NOTE/> The concern is that we do not know whether the types andconcentrations of PICs at these elevated CO levels, indicative of combustionupset conditions, are similar to the types and concentrations of PICs inour data base. It could be hypothesized that as combustion conditions deteriorate,the ratio of semi- and nonvolatile compounds to volatile compounds mayincrease. If so, this could have serious impacts on the proposed risk assessmentmethodology. First, the proposed generic unit risk value for THC may beunderstated when applied to THC emitted under poor combustion conditions.This is because semi- and nonvolatile compounds comprise only 1% of themass of THC in our data base, but pose 80% of the estimated cancer risk.Thus, if the fraction of semi- and nonvolatile compounds increases underpoor combustion conditions, the cancer risk posed by the compounds mayalso increase.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Hazardous waste incinerators have operated at CO levelsexceeding 13,000 ppmv during trial burns that achieved 99.99% distributionand removal efficiency.To put this concern in perspective, we note that the proposed THC riskvalue calculated from available data is 1andmultiply;10^5 m\3\/andCx.18;g.This unit risk is 100 times greater (i.e., more potent) than the unit riskfor the quantified PICs with the lowest unit risk (e.g., tetrachloroethylene),but 1000 times lower than the unit risk for PICs such as dibenzoanthracene,and 10,000 to 1,000,000 times lower than the unit risk for various chlorinateddioxins and furans.Second, if the fraction of semi- and nonvolatile THC increases under poorcombustion conditions, the fraction of THC in the vapor phase when enteringthe THC detector may be lower than the 75% assumed when operating undergood combustion conditions.\8\<NOTE/> If so, the correction factor for the so-called missing masswould be greater than the 1.33 factor proposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See discussions in U.S. EPA, ``Background InformationDocument for the Development of Regulations for PIC Emissions from HazardousWaste Incinerators'', December, 1988 (Draft Final Report).The Agency is currently conducting emissions testing to improve the database in support of the proposed risk-based approach. We are concerned,however, that the testing that is underway and planned may not provideinformation adequate to fully address all the issues. In addition, we areconcerned that our stack sampling and analysis procedures and our healtheffects data base are not adequate to satisfactorily characterize the healtheffects posed by Pics emitted under poor combustion conditions.A final concern with the risk assessment methodology is that it does notconsider health impacts resulting from indirect exposure. As explainedabove, the risk-based standards proposed today consider human health impactsonly from direct inhalation. Indirect exposure via uptake through the foodchain, for example, has not been considered because the Agency has notyet developed procedures for quantifying indirect exposure impacts forpurposes of establishing regulatory emission limits.b. <T3>Basis for the THC Limit.</T3> We request comment on a THC limit of20 ppmv as representative of a THC level distinguishing between good andpoor combustion conditions. Under this alternative approach, THC wouldbe monitored continuously during the trial burn, recorded on an hourlyaverage basis, reported as ppmv propane, and corrected to 7% oxygen. (Seediscussion below in section C.4 regarding performance specifications ofthe THC monitoring system.) We have tentatively selected a level of 20ppmv because: (1) It is within the range of values reported in our database for hazardous waste incinerators and boilers and industrial furnacesburning hazardous waste; and (2) the level appears to be protective ofhuman health based on risk assessments using the proposed methodology for30 incinerators.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Memorandum from Shiva Garg, EPA, to the Docket, entitled``Supporting Information for a GOP-Based THC Limit'', dated October 20,1988.The available data appear to indicate that the majority of devices canmeet a THC limit of 20 ppmv when operating under good combustion conditions(i.e., when CO is less than 100 ppmv). It appears, in fact, that many hazardouswaste incinerators can typically achieve THC levels of 5 to 10 ppmv whenoperating generally at low CO levels. When incinerators emit higher THClevels, CO levels typically exceed 100 ppmv, indicative of poor combustionconditions. The available information on boilers and industrial furnacesis not quite as clear, however. Although the data base indicates that boilersburning hazardous waste can easily meet a THC limit of 20 ppmv, the Agencyhas obtained data on various types of boilers burning various types offossil fuels (not hazardous waste) that indicate that THC levels can exceed20 ppmv when CO levels are less than 100 ppmv. See footnote 7. We are reviewingthat data and obtaining additional information to determine if an alternativelimit may be more appropriate for boilers. We specifically request commenton whether a THC concentration of 20 ppmv in fact represents good operatingpractice for boilers burning hazardous waste as the sole fuel or in combinationwith other fuels.We also request comment on whether a THC concentration of 20 ppmv representsgood operating practice for industrial furnaces. Preheater and precalcinercement kilns, for example, may not be able to readily achieve such a lowTHC concentration for the same reason that they typically cannot achieveCO levels below 100 ppmv. Normal raw materials such as limestone can containtrace levels of organic materials that oxidize incompletely as the rawmaterial moves down the kiln from the feed end to the hot end where fuelsare normally fired. Clearly, any THC (or CO) resulting from this phenomenonhas nothing to do with combustion or hazardous waste fuel. Thus, an incineratorand a preheater or precalciner cement kiln with exactly the same qualityof combustion conditions may have very different THC (and CO) levels. Werequest comment on: (1) The types of industrial furnaces for which a THClevel of 20 ppmv is representative of good combustion conditions; (2) whetheralternative THC limits may be more appropriate for certain industrial furnaces;and (3) whether an approach to identify a site-specific THC limit representativeof good operating practices may be feasible (e.g., where THC levels whenburning hazardous waste would be limited to baseline THC levels withoutburning hazardous waste). In support of comments, we request data on emissionsof CO and THC under baseline and hazardous waste burning conditions, includingcharacterization of the type and concentration of individual organic compoundsemitted.As mentioned previously, some data on CO and THC levels from industrialboilers burning fossil fuels (not hazardous waste) appear to indicate thatTHC levels can far exceed levels considered to be representative of goodcombustion conditions (20 ppmv) even though CO levels are less than 100ppmv. See footnote 7. If it appears that this situation can, in fact, occurfor particular devices burning particular fuels, we would consider requiringboth CO and THC monitoring for all such facilities irrespective of whetherCO levels were less than 100 ppmv during the trial burn. Thus, under thisscenario, the two-tiered CO controls proposed today would be replaced witha requirement to continuously monitor CO and THC for those particular facilities.We specifically request information on the types of facilities where THClevels may exceed 20 ppmv even though CO levels are less than 100 ppmv,and the need to continuously monitor THC for those facilities irrespectiveof the CO level achieved during the trial burn.C. Implementation of Tier I and Tier II PIC Controls1. <T3>Oxygen and Moisture Correction.</T3> The CO limits specified for eitherformat are on a dry gas basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. The oxygencorrection normalizes the CO data to a common base, recognizing the variationamong the different technologies as well as modes of operation using differentquantities of excess air. In-system leakage, the size of the facility andthe type of waste feed are other factors that cause oxygen concentrationto vary widely in flue gases. Seven percent oxygen was selected as thereference oxygen level because it is in the middle of the range of normaloxygen levels for hazardous waste combustion devices and it also is thereference level for the existing particulate standard for hazardous wasteincinerators under andSection; 264.343(c). The correction for humidity normalizesthe CO data from the different types of CO monitors (e.g., extractive vs.in situ). Our evaluation indicates that the above two corrections, whenapplied, could change the measured CO levels by a factor of two in somecases.Measured CO levels should be corrected continuously for the amount of oxygenin the stack gas according to the formula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,ns,tp0,p8,8/1,aw,12,2,5</C> <H1>CO</H1><T2>c</T2> = CO<T2>m</T2><H1/>andmultiply;<H1>14</H1><H2>21</H2>^Y<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where CO<T2>c</T2> is this corrected concentration of CO in the stack gas, CO<T2>m</T2> is the measured CO concentration according to guidelines specifiedin appendix C, and Y is the measured oxygen concentration on a dry basisin the stack. Oxygen should be measured at the same stack location thatCO is measured.2. <T3>Formats of the CO Limit.</T3> The CO limits under Tier I and Tier IIwould be implemented under two alternative formats. The applicant wouldselect the preferred approach on a case-by-case basis. Under Format A,CO would be measured and recorded as an hourly rolling average. Under FormatB, called the time-above-a-limit format, three parameters would be specified_anever-to-exceed CO limit, and a base CO limit not to be exceeded for morethan a specified time in each hour.In developing these alternative formats, EPA considered three alternatemethods:andbullet; A level never to be exceeded;andbullet; A level to be exceeded for an accumulated specified time withina determined time frame; andandbullet; An average level over a specified time that is never to be exceeded.The first alternative is the simplest and requires immediate hazardouswaste feed cutoff when the limit is exceeded, regardless of how long theCO levels remain high. Short-term CO excursions or peaks (a few minutesduration) are typical of combustion operations and can occur during routineoperations; e.g., when a burner is adjusted. It is possible that duringshutdown and start-up, the device may momentarily have high CO emissions.Since the total mass emissions under such momentary CO excursions is nothigh, a never-to-exceed limit would impede operations while providing littlereduction in health risk.The second alternative, allowing the CO level to exceed the limit for aspecified accumulative time within a determined time frame (e.g., x minutesin an hour), solves the problem associated with the first alternative.The hazardous waste feed would not be cut off by a single CO peak of highintensity yet they would be restricted from operation with several shortinterval CO peaks, or a single long duration peak.The third alternative, allowing the CO level never to exceed an averagelevel determined over a specified time, also avoids the problem of shuttingoff the waste feed each time an instantaneous CO peak occurs. A time-weightedaverage value (i.e., integrated area under the CO peaks over a given timeperiod) also provides a direct quantitative measure of mass emissions ofCO. For this reason, the use of a rolling average is EPA's preferred format.A combination of the first and second alternatives, with provisions tolimit mass CO emissions per unit time, its also proposed as an alternativeformat. This alternative CO format has been proposed to reduce the costof instrumentation from that required to provide continuous rolling averageCO values corrected for oxygen. This format may be particularly attractiveto operators of small or intermittently operated boilers. The CO monitoringsystem needed for the first alternative requires continuous measurementand adjustment of the oxygen correction factor and continuous computationof hourly rolling averages. The instrumentation costs of such a system,consisting of continuous CO and oxygen monitors with back-up systems, adata logger and microprocessor, could be up to $91,000 and would requireincreased sophistication and operating costs over simpler systems. Theonly instrumentation needed for the alternative time-above-the-limit formatis a CO monitor and a timer that can indicate cumulative time of exceedancesin every clock hour, at the end of which it is recalibrated (manually orelectronically) to restart afresh. Oxygen also would not have to be measuredcontinuously in this format; instead, an oxygen correction value can bedetermined from operating data collected during the trial burn. Subsequently,oxygen correction values would be determined annually or at more frequentintervals specified in the facility permit.\10\<NOTE/> We have not limited the use of this alternative CO formatto any size or to any type or class of device since we consider that thisalternative format provides an equal degree of control of CO emissionsto the rolling average format.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ We believe that annual determinations of the oxygen correctionfactor will be appropriate in most cases because the concern is whetherduct in-leakage has substantially changed over time. The fact that excessoxygen levels also change with waste type and feed rate should be consideredin establishing the correction factor initially.The alternative format would require dual CO levels to be established inthe permit, the first as a never to exceed limit and the second a lowerlimit for cumulative exceedances of no more than a specified time in anhour. These limits and the time duration of exceedance would be establishedon a case-by-case basis by equating the mass emissions (peak areas) inboth the formats so that the regulation is equally stringent in both cases.The PIC Background Document \11\<NOTE/> for the incinerator rules provides the methodology and mathematicalformulae showing how this can be done.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ U.S. EPA, ``Background Information Document for the Developmentof Regulations for PIC Emissions from Hazardous Waste Incinerators,'' December,1988 (Draft Final Report).3. <T3>Monitoring CO and Oxygen. </T3>Compliance with the Tier I CO limitwould require: (1) Continuous monitoring of CO during the trial burn andafter the facility is permitted; (2) continuous monitoring of oxygen duringthe trial burn and, under the 60-minute rolling average format, after thefacility is permitted; and (3) measurement of moisture during the trialburn and annually (or as specified in the permit) thereafter. Compliancewith the Tier II CO limits would require all the Tier I measurements andmeasurement of THC during the trial burn. Methods for measurements of COand oxygen, (and THC) must be in accordance with the 3rd edition of SW-846,as amended. The methods are summarized in Appendix C and are discussedin more detail in ``Proposed Methods for Stack Emissions Measurements ofCO, O<T2>2</T2>, THC, HCl, and Metals at Hazardous Waste Incinerators'', U.S.EPA, July, 1989 (Draft Final Report). If compliance with the CO standardis not demonstrated during the DRE trial burn, the CO test burn must beunder conditions identical to the DRE trial burn.4. <T3>Monitoring THC.</T3> Under Tier II, THC would be monitored during thetrial burn to ensure that the highest hourly average level does not exceed20 ppmv. An exceedance of the THC limit would be linked to automatic wastefeed cutoff. We believe that continuous THC monitoring should also be requiredover the life of the permit. This is because at high CO levels (e.g., greaterthan 100 ppmv) THC levels may or may not be high (e.g., greater than 20ppmv). The concern is that, although THC levels during the trial burn maybe less than 20 ppmv when CO exceeds 100 ppmv, operations over the lifeof the permit within the envelope allowed by the permit conditions mayresult in THC levels exceeding 20 ppmv. This concern was expressed by EPA'sScience Advisory Board during its critique of the proposed PIC controlsin the spring of 1989. EPA specifically requests comments on whether continuousmonitoring of THC should be required over the life of the permit underTier II.EPA had developed specifications for THC monitoring (see appendix D) thatwould have required heated gas sampling lines and a heated flame ionizationdetector (FID) to keep as much of the THC in the vapor phase as possible.EPA reasoned that heated sampling lines were needed because the FID candetect THC only in the vapor phase_condensed organic compounds are notmeasured. Preliminary results of field testing of a hazardous waste incineratorconducted in July 1988 indicate that detected THC levels were 3 to 27 timesgreater with a heated FID system compared to an unheated system when COlevels ranged from 100 ppmv to 2760 ppmv.\12\<NOTE/> The total mass of volatile, semivolatile, and nonvolatileorganic compounds was also quantified during those tests using the LevelI screening procedure.\13\<NOTE/> The results indicate that the THC levels detected by an unheatedFID were much lower than the levels determined by the Level I screeningprocedure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ U.S. EPA, ``Measurement of Particulates, Metals, andOrganics at a Hazardous Waste Incinerator'', November, 1988, (Draft FinalReport).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The Level I screening procedure is described in ``IERL-RTPProcedure Manual: Level I_Environmental Assessment,'' 2nd Edition, October1978 (EPA 600/7-78-201). That procedure uses gravimetric and total chromatographicalorganic procedures to quantify the mass of semi and nonvolatile organiccompounds.Based on cursory discussions in October of 1988 with several hazardouswaste incinerator operators, we had believed that such heated systems werein use at some facilities. A follow-up written survey \14\<NOTE/> indicated, however, that all of the six incinerator facilitiessurveyed that use a FID to monitor THC used a system that incorporatedgas conditioning_condensate traps accompanying gas cooling systems. Thus,the Agency has not been able to document operating experiences with a heated(i.e., not conditioned) gas sampling system. Further, we understand that,based on EPA tests using a heated FID at an incinerator (see footnote 11)and comments made during the SAB review of the PIC controls, a heated FIDsystem can pose a number of problems: (1) The sample extraction lines mayplug due to heavy particulate loadings and condensed organic compounds;and (2) semi and nonvolatile compounds may adsorb on the inside of theextraction lines causing unknown effects on measurements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ U.S. EPA, ``THC Monitor Survey'', June, 1989 (Draft FinalReport).Given these concerns about the technical feasibility of requiring the useof heated FIDs at this time, we are proposing that gas conditioning beallowed. Such conditioning could involve gas cooling to a level between32 anddegrees;F and the dew point of the gas and the use of condensate traps.To reduce operation and maintenance problems, the extraction lines andFID should probably still be heated.Allowing gas conditioning in the interim until unconditioned systems canbe shown to be practicable virtually precludes the use of the health-basedalternative to assess THC emissions under the Tier II controls. This isbecause a large, undetermined fraction of THC emissions will be condensedto the trap and will not be reported by the FID. This is another reasonthat the Agency prefers the technology-based, 20 ppmv limit on THC as theTier II standard.Although a FID system monitoring a conditioned gas will detect only thevolatile fraction of organic compounds (and, in some cases, only the nonwater-solublevolatile fraction), the Agency believes this is adequate for the purposeof determining whether the facility is operating under good operating conditions.\15\<NOTE/> Available data indicate that when emissions of semi and nonvolatileorganic compounds increase, volatile compounds also increase.\16\<NOTE/> Thus, volatile compounds appear to be a good indicator forthe semi and nonvolatile compounds that are often of greater concern becauseof their health effects. Given, however, that the good operating practice-basedTHC limit of 20 ppmv was based primarily on test burn data using heated(i.e., unconditioned gas) FID systems, the Agency considered whether tolower the recommended THC limit when an unheated system is used for compliancemonitoring. As discussed above, limited available field test data indicatedthat a heated system would detect two to four times the mass of organiccompounds than a conditioned system. We believe, however, that the 20 ppmvTHC limit is still appropriate when a conditioned system is used because:(1) The data correlating heated vs conditioned systems are very limited;(2) the data on THC emissions are limited (and there apparently is confusionin some cases as to whether the data were taken with a heated or conditionedsystem); and (3) the risk methodology is not sophisticated enough to demonstratethat a THC limit of 5 to 10 ppmv using a conditioned system rather thana limit of 20 ppmv is needed to adequately protect public health.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ We request comment on whether it would be practicableto develop a site-specific correction factor for monitoring with a conditionedgas system by monitoring with an unconditioned system as well during thetrial burn. The ratio of the unconditioned system THC level to the conditionedsystem THC level could then be used to correct the conditioned system THCvalues over the life of the permit. This approach may not be practicable,however, for reasons including the fact that the waste burned during thetrial burn for some facilities (e.g., facilities handling multiple wastes)may not represent, with respect to THC emissions, the waste that will beburned over the life of the permit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ U.S. EPA, ``Measurement of Particulates, Metals, andOrganics at a Hazardous Waste Incinerator,'' November, 1988 (Draft FinalReport).The THC monitoring method proposed in Appendix D will be modified to allowan unheated, conditioned system and use of condensate trap(s) and otherconditioning methods. The revised method will specify, however, that thesample gas may not be cooled below 32 anddegrees;F.5. <T3>Compliance with Tier I CO Limit.</T3> There are a number of alternativeapproaches to evaluate CO readings during the trial burn to determine compliancewith the 100 ppmv limit including: (1) The time-weighted average CO level(or the average of the hourly rolling averages); (2) the average of thehighests hourly rolling averages for all trial burn runs; of (3) the highesthourly rolling averge. The time-weighted average alternative provides thelowest CO level that could reasonably be used to determine compliance,and the highest hourly rolling average alternative provides the highestCO level that could reasonably be used. There may be other reasonable alternativesbetween these two extremes in addition to the one listed above.We are proposing to use the most conservative approach to interpret trialburn CO emissions for compliance with the 100 ppmv Tier I limit_the highesthourly rolling average. (This approach is conservative because we are comparingthe trial burn CO level to the maximum CO allowed under Tier I_100 ppmv.)We believe this conservative approach is reasonable given that compliancewith Tier I allows the applicant to avoid the Tier II requirement to evaluateTHC emissions to provide the additional assurance (or confirmation) thatTHC emissions do not exceed levels representative of good operating practice.6. <T3>Establishing Permit Limits for CO under Tier II.</T3> The alternativesdiscussed above for interpreting CO trial burn data also apply to specifyingthe permit limit for CO under Tier II. For purposes of specifying a TierII CO limit, however, the time-weighted average approach would be moreconservative than the highest hourly average approach because it wouldresult in a lower CO limit. We are proposing the conservative, time-weightedaverage approach for Tier II compliance because we are concerned that thehighest hourly average approach may not be adequately protective. Althoughthe highest hourly average (HHA) approach would be protective in theorybecause the applicant must demonstrate that the highest hourly averageTHC emissions do not exceed good operating practice-based levels, the HHAapproach would allow the facility to operate continuously over the lifeof the permit at the highest CO levels that occurred during one hour ofthe trial burn.We specifically request comments on how to interpret trial burn CO datato establish Tier II CO limits.7. <T3>Compliance with THC Limit of 20 ppmv.</T3> The alternative approachesfor determining compliance with the 20 ppmv THC limit under Tier II areidentical to those discussed above for compliance with the Tier I CO limit.Again, we are proposing the most conservative approach_the highest hourlyrolling average THC level during the (at a minimum) three test burns mustnot exceed 20 ppmv.8. <T3>Waste Feed Cutoffs.</T3> In 1987, EPA proposed that if a device exceededthe CO limits an aggregate of 10 times per month, then the owner or operatormust cease burning hazardous waste, notify the Regional Administrator,and not resume burning hazardous waste until reauthorized by the RegionalAdministration. Commenters complained that this proposed requirements wasoverly conservative. In response, EPA is considering deleting this restriction.We do not have data that indicate, nor are we aware of a good argumentthat would support, the need to limit cutoffs provided that combustionchamber temperatures are maintained at the levels that occurred duringthe trial burn for the duration of time that waste remains in the combustionchamber. We believe that maintaining temperatures will ensure that hydrocarbonsemanating from the waste remaining in the combustion chamber after a cutoffare destroyed to levels that would pose acceptable health risk. To complywith this requirement, the permit must specify the minimum combustion chambertemperature occurring during the trial burn for devices that may leavea waste residue in the combustion chamber after waste feed cutoff (e.g.,devices burning wastes that are solids). We note that, to comply with thisrequirement, owners and operators of boilers that comply with the proposedspecial operating conditions requisite to automatic waiver of the trialburn may be required to document minimum combustion chamber temperatureswhile complying with those special operating conditions. Moreover, we specificallyrequest comment on the need to specify in the permit for all boilers andindustrial furnaces, the minimum allowable combustion chamber temperaturesbased on the trial burn.We note that adequate auxiliary burner capacity may be needed to maintainthe temperature in the combustion chamber and allow destruction of thewaste materials and associated combustion gases left in the system afterthe waste feed is automatically cutoff. The safe start-up of the burnersusing auxiliary fuel requires approved burner safety management systemsfor prepurge, pilot lights, and induced draft fan starts. If these safetyrequirements preclude immediate start-up of auxiliary fuel burners andsuch start-up is needed to maintain temperatures (i.e., if the combustionchamber temperatures drop precipitously after waste feed cutoff), the auxiliaryfuel may have to be burned continuously on ``low fire'' during nonupsetconditions. After an automatic cutoff, hazardous waste should not be usedas auxiliary fuel unless the waste is hazardous solely because it is ignitable,corrosive, or reactive, or it contains insignificant levels of toxic constituents.We request comment on several alternative approaches to allow restart ofthe waste feed: (1) Restart after the hourly rolling average no longerexceeds the permit limit; (2) restart after an arbitrary 10 minute timeperiod to enable the operator to stabilize combustion conditions; or (3)restart after the <T3>instantaneous</T3> CO level meets the hourly rolling average limit.This third alternative (i.e., basing restarts on the instantaneous CO levels)may be appropriate because it may take quite a while for the hourly rollingaverage to come within the permit limit while the event that caused theexceedance may well be over even before the CO monitor reports the exceedance.Under this alternative, the rolling average could be ``re-set'' when thehazardous waste feed is restarted either by: (1) basing the hourly rollingaverage on the CO level for the first minute after the restart (the sameapproach that would be used any time the waste feed is restarted for reasonsother than a CO exceedance); or (2) assuming more conservatively giventhat CO levels may exceed the permit limit after the waste feed cutoffwhile residues continue to burn, that the hourly rolling average is equivalentto the permit limit (e.g., 100 ppmv) prior to the waste feed restart. Afinal refinement to this third alternative of allowing restarts after instantaneousCO levels fall below the permit limit would be not to reset the rollingaverage CO level and to require that the instantaneous CO level not exceedthe (rolling average) permit limit (e.g., 100 ppmv) for the period afterthe restart and until the rolling average falls below the permit limit.Again, we specifically request comment on these alternative approachesto allow waste feed restarts.When the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by a THC exceedance,we propose to allow a restart only after the hourly rolling average THClevel has been reduced to 20 ppmv or less. We are not considering the optionsdiscussed above for restarts after a CO exceedance given that THC is abetter surrogate for toxic organic emissions than CO. Thus, we believethat a more conservative waste feed restart policy is appropriate aftera THC exceedance.D. Miscellaneous Issues1. <T3>PIC Controls for Nonflame Industrial Furnaces.</T3> We note that thePIC controls discussed above may not adequately control THC emissions fromnonflame furnaces such as some electric arc smelters (in situations where,in fact, controls for emissions of organic compounds would apply (see discussionin section IX)). In nonflame devices where combustion is neither the primarymode of destruction of organic compounds in the waste, nor is used in anafterburner to burn hydrocarbon-laden off-gases from the thermal crackingof the waste, CO may not be an adequate surrogate to control THC emissions.That is, in nonflame devices, when CO emissions are low, THC emissionsmay be <T3>high.</T3> Thus, the Tier I CO limit of 100 ppmv may not be adequateto ensure that THC concentrations are low. Accordingly, we request commenton requiring continuous THC monitoring for nonflame devices to ensure thatTHC concentrations do not exceed the good operating practice-based levelof 20 ppmv.2. <T3>Measuring CO and THC in Preheater and Precalciner Cement Kilns.</T3>EPA has received comments that preheater and precalciner cement kilns typicallyhave bypass ducts that by-pass the preheater or precalciner and carry kilnoff-gases directly to the stack. Measuring CO and THC in the bypass ductrather than in the stack would provide data unaffected by CO and THC producedin the preheater or precalciner by coal combustion (in the precalciner)or by volatilizing trace levels of organic compounds present in the rawmaterial. Testing of bypass gases in lieu of stack gases would be acceptablefor compliance with the CO and THC controls provided that the CO and THClevels in the bypass gases are representative of the kiln off-gases (i.e.,provided that CO and THC in the kiln off-gases are not stratified beforeentering the bypass).3. <T3>Feeding Waste in Cement Kilns by Methods Other Than Dispersion in theFlame at the Hot End.</T3> The Agency is aware that several cement companiesare investigating the feasibility of feeding solid hazardous waste intocement kilns and some facilities are already engaging in the practice.The solid materials are fed into the kiln system at locations other thanthe ``hot'' end of the kiln where liquid hazardous waste fuels and fossilfuels are normally fired. These practices may be an effective approachto both beneficially use the heating value in solid hazardous wastes andprovide needed treatment capacity for such wastes. The Agency has not,however, conducted emission testing of cement kiln systems when burningsolid hazardous wastes. Depending on the kiln system, location of the firingport, and type and quantity of hazardous waste fired, there is a potentialconcern for incomplete combustion of organic compounds in the waste. Conceivably,the waste may be fired into the systems at a point where adequate temperaturesand residence time may not be provided to ensure adequate destruction.In addition, if a kiln system is equipped with a by-pass duct, combustiongases from burning the hazardous waste may be ``short-circuited'' and routedto the stack before adequate destruction can occur.The proposed controls will effectively control emissions irrespective ofhow solid hazardous waste may be fired into kiln systems because the standardswould apply to stack emissions. The question is, given that the Agencyhas not yet tested such operations, whether special requirements shouldbe applied during interim status. We specifically request comment on theneed for special controls during interim status when cement kiln systemsfeed hazardous waste at locations other than the hot end. Commenters shouldprovide information on such practice, including data on organic emissions(e.g., DRE results, CO and THC concentration), and suggestions on appropriateinterim status controls, if any are considered necessary (i.e., in additionto the interim status standards that would be applicable to all boilersand industrial furnaces, as discussed elsewhere in today's notice).E. Implementation of PIC Controls During Interim Status1. <T3>Preferred Option.</T3> We believe that the PIC controls can and shouldbe applied as soon as possible for facilities in interim status. Thus,we are requesting comment on whether the following compliance scheduleis reasonable. Within 12 months of promulgation of the final rule, boilersand industrial furnaces operating under interim status must install COmonitoring equipment meeting the performance specifications presented intoday's notice and determine compliance with the Tier I standard of 100ppmv during a test burn representative of worst-case combustion conditionsthat will occur during interim status.\17\<NOTE/> (Irrespective of which CO format is selected (i.e., hourlyrolling average or time-above-a-limit) the maximum hourly average CO levelduring the test burn cannot exceed 100 ppmv under Tier I.) If CO levelsdo not exceed 100 ppmv, CO levels are limited during interim status to100 ppmv.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ A single test burn consisting of 3 runs should be conductedto demonstrate compliance with all emissions standards_CO/THC, particulates,metals, and HCl. If simultaneous compliance testing is not practicable,however, the operating conditions of the test burns must be identical.We propose the CO and, if necessary THC, be monitored continuously fora minimum of 4 hours for each of three runs to provide a valid test burn.This time period is typical of that required for testing of destructionand removal efficiency.If the maximum hourly average CO level exceeds 100 ppmv during the testburn, the owner or operator must, within 15 months of promulgation of thefinal rule, demonstrate that the maximum hourly average THC concentrationdoes not exceed 20 ppmv during a test burn equivalent to the Tier I testburn, using THC monitoring equipment meeting the performance specificationspresented in today's notice. If the THC concentration does not exceed 20ppmv during the test burn, then, during the period of interim status, continuousmonitoring of THC would be required to ensure that THC does not exceed20 ppmv, and continuous monitoring of CO would be required to ensure thatCO does not exceed the time-weighted average CO level that occurred duringthe test burn.If the maximum hourly average THC level exceeds 20 ppmv during the testburn, the owner or operator must, within 18 months of promulgation of thefinal rule, modify operations as necessary and demonstrate in a subsequenttest burn that THC concentrations do not exceed 20 ppmv, or cease burninghazardous waste and complete closure requirements.We are considering an exception to the 20 ppmv THC limit, however, forcement kilns that can demonstrate that fuel-derived THC levels do not exceedthe 20 ppmv limit even though stack gas concentrations may exceed the limit.The concern is that trace levels of organic compounds in the raw materials(e.g., limestone) can produce THC as the materials are gradually heatedas they travel from the cold (i.e., feed) end of the kiln to the hot (i.e.,fuel firing) end of the kiln. We specifically request comment on whetheronly fuel-derived THC should be considered for purposes of compliance withthe proposed THC limits. If so, we further request comment on whether thefollowing approach is reasonable to identify fuel-derived THC. For cementkiln systems that burn or feed fuels only in the hot end of the kiln wherethe clinker product exits, the fuel-derived THC concentration could bedetermined by increasing excess oxygen levels much beyond normal levels(e.g., to 10%) and noting the minimum hourly average THC concentrationthat occurs. This is based on an assumption that, at high excess oxygenlevels, fuel combustion efficiency will be maximized and fuel-derived THCwill be virtually zero. Thus, residual THC would be attributable to organicmatter in the raw materials. Accordingly, the allowable THC concentrationwould be 20 ppmv greater than the baseline nonfuel THC (i.e., the lowesthourly average concentration during the high excess oxygen tests). It isimportant to note that we are suggesting two limitations to this test:(1) only fossil fuel would be burned during the demonstration of nonfuelTHC; and (2) the approach would be applicable to only those kiln systemsthat burn or feed fuels during the subject test in the hot end of the kiln(i.e., precalciner kilns and kilns feeding coal along with raw materialin a preheater during the high excess oxygen test would not be eligiblebecause incomplete combustion of the fuel could occur even at high excessoxygen levels).Extensions of time may be allowable by the Regional Administrator on acase-by-case basis if circumstances beyond the owner or operator's controlaffect the facility's ability to comply with the above schedule.2. <T3>Alternate Option.</T3> EPA is considering the following alternativeapproach to expedite implementation of the substantive PIC controls. Underthis option, the owner or operator would be required within 18 months ofpromulgation of the final rule either to submit a complete Part B RCRAPermit Application, or to cease burning hazardous waste and complete closurerequirements. This option has at least two major disadvantages. First,substantive controls on PIC emissions would not be applied until the PartB permit is issued. Second, the State or EPA permit officials may havehigher priority facilities to handle and, thus, may not be able to processthe applications for some time after they are submitted. The informationprovided in the permit may, in fact, become outdated before the permitofficials start to process the application. In those situations, applicantsmay be required to submit revised, updated permit applications.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Alternative Toxic Metal Standards</ITAG>A. OverviewThe 1987 proposed rule would have established a four-tiered standard tocontrol emissions of arsenic, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and lead. TiersI through III would have established hazardous waste concentration, feedrate, and emission rate screening limits as a function of device type andthermal capacity. Tier IV would have provided for site-specific dispersionmodeling to demonstrate that, when the screening limits were exceeded,emissions would, nevertheless, not pose unacceptable health risk. Althoughavailable data indicate that only the four metals specified of the 12 toxicmetals listed in appendix VIII of part 261 are likely to be present inhazardous wastes burned in boilers and industrial furnaces at levels thatpose unacceptable health risk, the permit writer would have to determineon a case-by-case basis that the other toxic metals were, in fact, notpresent at levels that could pose unacceptable risk.Based on comments on the proposed rule and additional evaluation of therisk assessment approach, we are considering the following changes to themetals controls: (1) Expand the list of controlled metals to include allthose toxic metals listed in appendix VIII of part 261 (except, for reasonsdiscussed later, nickel and selenium); (2) establish the screening limitsas a function of effective stack height, terrain, and land use rather thanas a function of device type and capacity; and (3) provide the screeninglimit values in the Risk Assessment Guideline for Permitting HazardousWaste Thermal Treatment Devices (RAG) rather than in the rule itself. Thebasis for these changes is discussed below.B. Expanded List of MetalsCommenters noted that EPA's data base on the metals composition of hazardouswaste is both limited and out of date in light of the Agency's efforts_andthe statutory command_to require pretreatment of wastes that heretoforehave been directly land disposed. Pretreatment is likely often to involvecombustion. Thus, the other toxic metals could be found increasingly inhazardous wastes that are burned in boilers and industrial furnaces. Inaddition, if more toxic metal standards were included in the rule, theburden on permit writers would actually be reduced because explicit standardswould be provided for all metals of potential concern. The length of permitproceedings would thus be shortened relieving to some extent regulatoryburden as well.We, therefore, are considering expanding the list of controlled metalsto include: antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium (VI),lead, mercury, silver, and thallium. Thus, of the 12 metals listed in AppendixVIII, only selenium and nickel would not be controlled. We are not consideringcontrols for selenium because the Agency has inadequate health data toestablish a reference air concentration. Nickel would not be controlledbecause the two nickel compounds suspected at this time of being potentialhuman carcinogens, nickel carbonyl and subsulfide, are not likely to beemitted from combustion devices, given the highly oxidizing conditionsthat exist in combustion devices. We note, however, that some industrialfurnaces (e.g., electric arc smelters) do not use combustion to provideheat to drive process reactions. Such furnaces could conceivably emit thereduced, carcinogenic forms of nickel if present in the hazardous wastefeed. We specifically request information on emissions of nickel carbonyland subsulfide from such furnaces and suitable stack sampling and analysisprocedures.C. Revised Format for Screening LimitsIn developing the proposed amendments to the incineration standards thatthe Agency plans to propose shortly, we developed Screening Limits formetals (and HCl and THC) as a function of effective stack height, terrain,and land use. As discussed above, we believe that basing limits on theseparameters more directly ties the controls to the key parameters that affectdispersion of emissions and, ultimately, ambient levels. When developingthe proposed Tier I through Tier III screening limits for boilers and industrialfurnaces in 1987, we made a simplifying assumption that effective stackheight correlated with thermal capacity (e.g., if the thermal capacityof one device was 10 percent greater than the thermal capacity of another,then the effective stack height was also 10 percent greater). This is notalways true. Stack height is often more a function of the height of nearbybuildings and surrounding terrain than the heat input capacity of the device.Thus, we are considering establishing for boilers and industrial furnacesthe identical feed rate and emission rate Screening Limits we plan to proposefor incinerators. The Screening Limits are presented in Appendix E, andthe technical support for the Limits is summarized in appendix F. We wouldalso implement the metals controls for boilers and furnaces as we planto propose in the incinerator amendments (i.e., risk from carcinogenicmetals must be summed; risk from all on-site hazardous waste combustionfacilities must be considered). See appendix G.We note that, under this approach, screening limits provided by Tier Iof the proposed rule would be deleted. Tier I established metals concentrationslimits for hazardous waste in units of pounds of metal per million BTUof heat input to the device. Under that tier, the device was conservativelyassumed to burn 100 percent hazardous waste (i.e., metals levels in hazardouswaste burned in these devices are most always higher than in cofired fossilfuels). Under such a conservative assumption, we believe that few facilitiesburn hazardous waste with metals levels low enough to meet the Tier I limits.Note also that the feed rate Screening Limits provided by Appendices B-1through B-4 of the proposed incinerator amendments would replace the TierII limits originally proposed for boilers and industrial furnaces. Therisk assessment methodology remains basically the same as proposed in 1987.EPA will, however, continue to accept comments on this methodology.D. Screening Limits Provided by the Risk Assessment GuidelineWe are considering providing the Screening Limits in the Risk AssessmentGuidelines for Permitting Hazardous Waste Thermal Treatment Devices (RAG)rather than in the rule (i.e., the Code of Federal Regulations). This isconsistent with the approach the Agency plans to propose for the incineratoramendments and would enable the Agency to update the limits as health effectsdata are revised and EPA's dispersion models evolve. Revisions to the RAGwould be noticed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>with the current edition noted.However, EPA solicits comment on this and an alternative approach wherebythe Agency would promulgate Screening Limits in the rule, as originallyproposed for boilers and industrial furnaces. Providing the Screening Limitsin the RAG has limitations. Our concern is that guidance documents do notcarry the weight of a regulation_permit writers would be free to acceptor reject the guidance (e.g., Screening Limits RACs, RSDs) and would beobligated to justify use and appropriateness of the guidance on a case-by-casebasis. This could place a substantial burden on the permit writer and resultin inconsistent, and, perhaps, inappropriate permit conditions. If theScreening Limits are promulgated in the rule, EPA would then revise themby rulemaking if warranted by new information. In the interim, permit writerscould apply stricter limits than contained in the rule (if the facts justifyit) pursuant to the omnibus permit authority in section 3005(c)(3) (withnotice and comment provided on the potential change during the permit proceeding).E. Implementation of Metals Controls During Interim Status1. <T3>Preferred Option.</T3> We are considering a significant modificationto the proposed compliance schedule. Under this alternative, interim statussources would determine compliance with metal (and HC1) Screening Limitswithin 12 months of promulgation of the final rule. If a source cannotcomply with the Screening Limits within the initial 12 months, then theowner or operator must: (1) Within 15 months of promulgation, demonstratecompliance with the reference air concentrations for noncarcinogenic metalsand the 10^5 risk level for carcinogenic metals using dispersion modeling;or (2) within 24 months of promulgation, either modify the facility anddemonstrate compliance or complete closure requirements with respect tohazardous waste burning. The Regional Administrator could extend the complianceperiod if the owner or operator can show inability to make required modificationsbecause of situations beyond its control (e.g., unavailability of equipment).2. <T3>Alternative Options.</T3> In addition, EPA is considering the followingalternative interim status requirements, similar to those for particulates,to bring sources into compliance with the metals (and HCL) standards. Thefirst would require facilities that cannot demonstrate compliance within12 months of promulgation to submit a compliance plan within 15 monthsof promulgation which assures expedient compliance (i.e., within 12 monthsof EPA approval). The last alternative would require the source to submita complete Part B RCRA Permit Application, draft trial burn plan, and site-specificrisk assessment as applicable, within 18 months of promulgation; or implementclosure requirements within 18 months of promulgation. EPA is requestingcomments on all three alternatives for implementing metals and HCl standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Alternative Hydrogen Chloride Standards</ITAG>EPA is also considering an alternative approach to the proposed hydrogenchloride (HCl) standards. As discussed above for the metals standards,we are considering: (1) Establishing the screening limits as a functionof effective stack height, terrain, and land use rather than device typeand capacity; and (2) providing the screening limit values in the RAG ratherthan in the rule itself. (The HCl controls would also be implemented duringinterim status like the metals controls.) The bases for these changes areidentical to those discussed above for metals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Revisions to the Proposed Small Quantity Burner Exemption</ITAG>A. SummaryEPA proposed to exempt facilities that burn de minimis quantities of theirown hazardous waste because, absent regulatory control, the health riskposed by such burning would not be significant. Eligibility for the exemptionwould be based on the quantity of waste burned per month, established asa function of device type and thermal capacity. In order to be exempt,in addition to restrictions on quantity of waste burned, facilities wouldbe required to notify the Regional Administrator that they are a smallquantity burner, the maximum instantaneous waste firing rate would be limitedto one percent of total fuel burned, and dioxin-containing acutely toxicwastes could not be burned. See proposed andSection; 266.34-1(b).We are considering several revisions to this proposed provision. Ratherthan establishing exemption quantities as a function of device type andcapacity, we are considering using effective stack height. Also, severalimprovements could be made in the risk assessment methodology and the proceduresfor handling multiple devices could be made less arbitrary to reduce over-regulation.The basis for these changes is discussed below.B. Revised Format for Exempt QuantitiesUnder this alternative approach, exempt quantities would be establishedas a function of effective stack height rather than device type and thermalcapacity (see Table 1). We believe this approach is preferable for thereasons discussed above. We note that we are not suggesting to includethe two variables used for the metals and HCl limits, terrain type andland use classification, in establishing revised exempt quantities. Rather,the revised quantities are based on assumptions of terrain and land usethat result in the lowest (i.e., most conservative) exempt quantities.We believe that this conservative approach is appropriate given that therewould be no EPA or State agency oversight of an operator's determinationof his terrain and land use classification.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Exempt Quantities for Small Quantity Burner Exemption</T4><H1>Terrain-adjusted effective stack height of device (meters)</H1><H1>Allowable hazardous waste burning rates (gallons/month)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">0 to 3.9 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4.0 to 5.9 <D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6.0 to 7.9 <D>18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.0 to 9.9 <D>27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.0 to 11.9 <D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12.0 to 13.9 <D>48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14.0 to 15.9 <D>59</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16.0 to 17.9 <D>69</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18.0 to 19.9 <D>76</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.0 to 21.9 <D>84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22.0 to 23.9 <D>93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24.0 to 25.9 <D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26.0 to 27.9 <D>110</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28.0 to 29.9 <D>130</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30.0 to 34.9 <D>140</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35.0 to 39.9 <D>170</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40.0 to 44.9 <D>210</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45.0 to 49.9 <D>260</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50.0 to 54.9 <D>330</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">55.0 to 59.9 <D>400</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">60.0 to 64.9 <D>490</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">65.0 to 69.9 <D>610</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70.0 to 74.9 <D>680</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75.0 to 79.9 <D>760</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">80.0 to 84.9 <D>850</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85.0 to 89.9 <D>960</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90.0 to 94.9 <D>1,100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95.0 to 99.9 <D>1,200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100.0 to 104.9 <D>1,300</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105.0 to 109.9 <D>1,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110.0 to 114.9 <D>1,700</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Greater than 115.0 <D>1,900</D></ITAG></ITAG>C. Improvements in the Risk Assessment MethodologyThe changes in the risk assessment methodology used to develop the revisedexempt quantities presented in Table 1 include: (1) Consideration of therisk from emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC) rather than only thoseproducts of incomplete combustion (PICs) quantified during EPA's fieldtesting program; and (2) a carcinogenic potency of Q<T2>1</T2>*=0.07 (that translates to a unit risk of 2.0andmultiply;10^5)was assumed for the THC rather than a Q<T2>1</T2>* of 1.0 for PICs. The revised Q<T2>1</T2>* is based on the average weighted unit risk developed to controlTHC emissions (see discussion above under alternative CO standards) whichwas doubled to account for the fact that THC emissions will likely be moretoxic at the conservatively assumed 99 percent DRE than at the 99.99 percentDRE measured during the tests.We are considering this change because we are concerned about a nonconservativefeature of the PIC/POHC ratio used to estimate the risk from PIC emissionsin establishing the proposed exempt quantities. The PIC/POHC ratio considersonly those PICs for which emissions have been quantified. As discussedelsewhere in this Notice, organic compounds, other than those specificallyquantified to date, are emitted from these combustion devices, and someof those compounds are undoubtedly toxic. Thus, we believe it is prudent(conservative) to consider THC rather than just quantified PICs in thisanalysis.A detailed description of the methodology used to calculate the revisedexempt quantities is available in the docket for public review and comment.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ U.S. EPA, ``Analysis for Calculating a <T3>de Minimis</T3> Exemption for Burning Small Quantities of Waste inCombustion Devices'', August 1989.The revised approach uses the following equation to calculate exempt quantities:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s10,2,15,1,25,2</C> <H1>Allowable THC Mass Emission Rate=THC Emis.

Definition of Indigenous Waste That Is Reclaimed</ITAG>In the May 6, 1987, notice, the Agency solicited comment on the issue ofwhen a hazardous waste that was burned exclusively for material recoverymight be considered to be ``indigenous'' to the industrial furnace in whichit was being burned. See 52 FR 16990-991. The significance of being indigenousis that the material would cease being a solid and hazardous waste uponbeing inserted into the industrial furnace. At that point, it would bean in-process material and no longer discarded. The industrial furnacethus would not be subject to the proposed emission standards. In addition,any residues from burning would not be subject to the derived-from rulein andSection; 261.3(c)(2) because such residues would not derive from managementof a hazardous waste.The Agency proposed that a waste be considered indigenous if it was generatedand burned in the same type of industrial furnace. In addition, scrap metalwould be considered indigenous to any secondary smelting furnace, and leadacid battery plates and grids would have been considered to be indigenousto secondary lead smelting furnaces.Commenters almost unanimously favored some type of indigenous test, butdisagreed on its precise scope, offering a variety of suggestions. Afteranalyzing these comments, the Agency solicits comment on a different optionwhich incorporates features from the Agency's initial proposal, as wellas proposals received from previous public comments.As summarized below, the test for when a waste is indigenous to an industrialfurnace would vary according to the source of the waste, and, in some cases,whether the industrial furnace is a primary or secondary furnace (whetherit processes chiefly ores or secondary materials such as scrap metal).A. Industrial (Smelting) Furnaces in the Standard Industrial Code (SIC)33 Burning Wastes From SIC 33 ProcessesStandard Industrial Code 33 encompasses all Primary Metal Industries includingiron and steel manufacturing and processing, and iron and steel foundries;and primary and secondary nonferrous metal manufacturing and processingaccording to the 1972 Edition of the SIC. Commenters suggested and theAgency tentatively agrees, that these processes are sufficiently interrelatedthat secondary materials going from one process to another within thisSIC code (33) should be generally considered indigenous.However, situations may arise where wastes from SIC 33 processes are burnedin SIC 33 furnaces for the objective of waste treatment by destroying unrecyclabletoxic constituents (that would be ``discarded materials'' within the meaningof RCRA 1004(27)). Therefore, to be considered indigenous, the only unrecyclabletoxic constituents (i.e., compounds listed in Appendix VIII 40 CFR part261) the waste could contain are those that are found in the virgin materialcustomarily processed (provided that the concentration in the waste isnot significantly higher than concentrations in the raw material), andthose that are present only in insignificant amounts if not normally foundin the virgin material customarily processed in industrial furnaces. Inthe Agency's opinion, an insignificant amount of unrecyclable constituentswould be 500 ppm of total nonindigenous toxic organics or 500 ppm of totalnonindigenous toxic metals (or inorganic toxics) above the levels of thosetoxic constituents found in the virgin material customarily processed.In the EPA's judgment, this concentration level represents a concentrationof material far exceeding minimal trace levels (generally measured in singledigit parts per million (ppm) or tens of ppm). This level of a hazardousconstituent could create an incremental health risk if burned inefficiently,or with inadequate emission controls, and, moreover, indicates that theobjective of burning is waste treatment as opposed to reclamation.The following example illustrates this test as to whether a waste is indigenous:andbullet; A steel production facility sends its electric arc furnace emissioncontrol dust (Hazardous Waste K061) to a zinc smelting furnace for zincrecovery. This waste contain 500 ppm and 2,100 ppm of cadmium and leadrespectively. Assume for purposes of this example, lead and cadmium arealso found in zinc ore concentrates at levels of 200 ppm and 2,000 ppmrespectively. Lead and cadmium are not recycled_they do not partition primarilyto a product.As a result, K061 would be considered to be indigenous because steel productionand zinc smelting are both SIC 33 activities, and these dusts are highin zinc content, indicating that legitimate material recovery is occurring.This is true even though the waste contains unrecyclable toxic constituentsin significant concentrations.19<NOTE/> However, these constituents are also present in significantconcentrations in virgin ore concentrates customarily processed by zincsmelting facilities. The waste contains a total of 400 ppm (300 ppm leadand 100 ppm cadmium) of toxic metals above the virgin material, and, thus,does not exceed the 500 ppm limit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>19 Note: Some zinc smelters may be capable of also recoveringcadmium and lead.B. SIC Code 33 Industrial Furnaces Burning Wastes Generatedby Process Other Than SIC 33When an SIC Code 33 industrial furnace burns a material generated by aprocess other than SIC 33, there is no longer such similarity of processand material that transfer of wastes should be considered <T3>prima facie</T3> indigenous. There is also a greater likelihood thatthe purpose of burning really is waste treatment. This is because the materialsbeing burned are more likely to contain high concentrations of unrecyclable,nonindigenous toxic constituents (i.e., toxic constituents not found inthe virgin material customarily burned in the industrial furnace) becauseof the dissimilarity of the generating and recovery processes. Consequently,the Agency is tentatively of the view that a material generated by a non-SICcode 33 process burned in an SIC 33 code furnace would only be indigenousto that furnace if it contained unrecovered toxic constituents presentin the waste in insignificant concentrations, i.e., less than 500 ppm fortotal Appendix VIII toxic organic compounds and 500 ppm for total unreclaimedAppendix VIII toxic metals.The following example illustrates operation of this principle. An electroplatingfacility sends its wastewater treatment sludge (Hazardous waste F006) toa primary copper smelter for recovery of copper. The electroplating sludgealso contains thousands of parts per million each of cyanide, cadmium andlead which are not beneficially recovered in the smelting process. Theelectroplating sludge would not be considered indigenous to the primarycopper smelter. The sludge is not from a SIC 33 process and contains substantialconcentrations of unrecovered toxic constituents which are discarded bythe process. The environmental concern is that, due to the presence ofthese nonindigenous toxics, the waste poses risks_in the transport, storageand burning phase as well as residuals_that are different than those posedby the raw materials customarily burned in the devices.C. Secondary Smelting FurnacesAs the Agency noted at proposal, a somewhat broader notion of indigenousmaterial is needed for secondary smelting furnaces because these furnacesnormally accept secondary materials (principally scrap metal) as theirprincipal feed material. Thus, the Agency would consider any scrap metalindigenous to a secondary smelter. Further, the Agency would consider anymaterial with recoverable metal values indigenous to a secondary smelterproviding that the materials do not contain high concentrations of nonrecoveredorganics or significant concentrations of metals or inorganics not foundin the non-hazardous secondary materials utilized as feed by secondarysmelting furnaces. To be considered indigenous, these materials need notbe generated by an SIC 33 process. This type of comparison, rather thana comparison just with virgin ore concentrate utilized by primary smelters,could be appropriate given that secondary smelting furnaces are differenttypes of furnaces than primary furnaces, and given further that secondarysmelters have traditionally processed a wider range of materials than primarysmelters.In addition, for secondary lead furnaces, the Agency would view items listedin Table 2 as indigenous. These are normal feed materials to secondarylead furnaces. Also, any lead-bearing waste from manufacture of batterieswould be considered indigenous to a secondary lead smelter. These materialsare likewise routinely sent to lead smelters for lead recovery and arewithin any normal contemplation of the term indigenous. EPA is specificallyrequesting comment as to whether this list is complete.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2_<T4>Materials Indigenous to Secondary Lead Furnaces When Generated by Primaryand Secondary Lead Furnace or Lead Battery Manufacturing Operations</T4><H1> </H1>Acid dump/fill solidsBaghouse dustsScrap gridsScrap batteriesScrap lead oxideDrossScrap platesSlurry and slurry screeningsSump mudLead acetate from laboratory analysesAcid filtersBaghouse bagsScrap battery cases, covers, ventsCharging jumpers and clipsDisposable clothing (coveralls, aprons, hats, gloves)Floor sweepingsAir filtersPasting beltsPlaten abrasiveRespirator cartridge filtersShop abrasivesStacking boardsWaste shipping containers (cartons, plastic bags, drums)Water filter mediaPaper hand towelsCheesecloth from pasting rollersPasting additive bagsWiping ragsContaminated pallets</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Conforming Requirements</ITAG>EPA is considering a proposal to amend to the incinerator standards ofsubpart O, part 264 and part 270. Many of the boiler and furnace requirementsproposed in 1987 were taken, from the planned changes to the incineratorstandards. Thus, all revisions that ultimately are proposed to such incineratorstandards also will be proposed, as part of that notice, to apply to boilersand industrial furnaces.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Halogen Acid Furnaces</ITAG>On March 31, 1986, Dow Chemical Company petitioned EPA, in accordance withthe provisions of 40 CFR 260.20, requesting EPA to designate their halogenacid furnaces (HAFs) as industrial furnaces under 40 CFR 260.10. EPA thenproposed to grant the petition in the May 6, 1987, proposal.EPA received comments and additional information on the petition and, asa result, plans to repropose this rule change as part of the proposed amendmentsto the hazardous waste incinerator standards. A detailed discussion willbe provided in that preamble. However, a brief summary of the changes EPAis considering are listed below:1. The halogen acid concentration of the halogen acid solutions producedwill be lowered to three percent from six percent.2. Fifty percent of the acid must be used onsite. This condition did notappear in the original proposal.3. EPA proposes to allow the burning of offsite waste providing it is indigenousto Chemical Production (i.e., generated by Standard Industrial Classification281 or 286).4. The waste being burned must contain at least 20 percent halogens byweight.5. Waste fed to HAFs would be listed as inherently waste-like under 40CFR 261.2(d) to ensure they remain regulated.EPA is considering the imposition of some or all of the above changes,and, although we will not consider comments on these issues received inresponse to today's notice, we will request comments on these alternativeswhen they are proposed as a part of the amendments to the incinerator standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Regulation of Smelting Furnaces Involved in Materials Recovery</ITAG>In the May 6, 1986, proposal, EPA proposed regulatory standards for smeltingfurnaces burning metal-bearing hazardous waste to recover metals that werethe same as the standards for furnaces and boilers burning hazardous wastesfor energy recovery. As discussed in section VI above, smelters burningnonindigenous waste would be subject to full regulation.We have reconsidered how the proposed rules should apply when permittingsmelters and request comment on the following approach. We do not believeit is appropriate to apply the organic emissions controls (i.e., destructionand removal efficiency (DRE), and carbon monoxide emissions standards)to smelters that burn waste containing <T3>de minimis</T3> levels of toxic organic constituents. We believe thatsuch <T3>de minimis</T3> levels could be based on the quantity levels establishedfor the small quantity burner exemption. See table 1 of section V of thisnotice. To establish <T3>de minimis</T3> feed rates of total organic constituents for smelters,the small quantity burner exemption quantities in gallons per month couldbe converted to pounds per month assuming a waste density of 8 lb/gallon.Burning/processing these feed rates of toxic organic constituents absentthe DRE and CO controls should be protective given that the exempt quantitieswere calculated assuming a 99% DRE and considered the health risk fromtotal hydrocarbon emissions (i.e., unburned organic compounds in the wasteand products of incomplete combustion). In order to simplify compliancemonitoring and assure adequate conservatism when not making a DRE determination,we believe total organic carbon (TOC) could be used as an indicator fortoxic organic constituents. A TOC measurement is conservative because itmeasures all organic compounds, not just toxic (appendix VIII) constituents.We do not believe a similar, purely health-based approach is appropriateto determine when the proposed metals controls should apply when permittingsmelters. Rather, we believe that the metals controls should apply onlywhen the hazardous waste significantly affects emissions of toxic (appendixVIII) metals. If we were to regulate metals emissions when burning/processinghazardous waste even though those emissions are not adversely affected,we would create an economic disincentive to smelting hazardous waste. Smeltersburning hazardous wastes could be regulated more stringently with respectto the same metals than smelters processing ores even though metals emissionswere identical. In that situation, ores could displace the hazardous wastewith no environmental benefit. To determine if the hazardous waste significantlyaffects toxic metals emissions, the applicant would need to demonstratethat either: (1) The concentration of each regulated toxic metal in thehazardous waste is not significantly greater than the average level ofthe metal in normal, nonhazardous waste feedstocks; or (2) the emissionsof each regulated toxic metal present in the hazardous waste is not significantlygreater than baseline emissions when hazardous waste is not processed.An appropriate statistical test would be used in either case to determineif an increase were significant. The proposed metals controls would applyto each metal for which the applicant could not make a successful or significantincrease demonstration.We specifically invite comment on these approaches to determine the applicabilityof the proposed controls on organic and metals emissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Status of Residues from Burning Hazardous Waste</ITAG>Under the Agency's existing regulations, wastes that are derived from thetreatment of listed hazardous wastes are also considered to be hazardousunless and until they are delisted. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c)(2) and (d)(2).Thermal combustion of hazardous waste, no matter the type of device inwhich it occurs or the purpose of burning, is a type of treatment. Accordingly,under the Agency's existing rules, residues from thermal combustion oflisted hazardous waste are considered to remain the listed hazardous wasteuntil delisted.When the device burning hazardous waste is a boiler burning primarily coalor other fossil fuels, an industrial furnace processing ores or minerals(e.g., light-weight aggregate kilns), or a cement kiln, a further considerationenters: the applicability of the so-called Bevill amendment (which requiresa special study before subtitle C regulations can be imposed). (See RCRAsection 3001(b)(3)(A) (i)-(iii).) The Agency has stated previously thatwhen these devices burn hazardous waste fuels: (1) Residues of industrialand utility boilers burning at least 50 percent coal remain within theBevill amendment; (2) residues of boilers burning oil or gas with othermaterials are not within the Bevill amendment; and (3) residues of industrialfurnaces (processing ores or minerals) and cement kilns burning hazardouswaste fuel remain within the Bevill amendment. See generally 50 FR 49190and n. 87-89 (Nov. 29, 1985). The underlying principle for these determinationswas that residues would remain within the Bevill amendment if the characterof the residual is determined by the Bevill material (i.e., coal, oresor minerals, or cement aggregate) being burned or processed. Thus, anyresidues that come from burning or processing the Bevill material requiresa special study before it could come under Subtitle C regulation and sowould remain exempt.In a later proposal, the Agency suggested a refinement of these positionsto address residues from industrial furnaces processing ores or mineralsand cement kilns burning nonindigenous hazardous waste for materials recovery.See 52 FR 17012-013 (May 6, 1987). Under that proposal, such residues wouldremain within the Bevill Amendment provided that at least 50 percent ofthe raw material feed to the device was a virgin ore or mineral. In addition,residues from devices burning hazardous waste for the purpose of destruction(i.e., for neither energy nor materials recovery) would be outside of theBevill amendment.We have further evaluated these interpretations in light of our statedprinciple: residues from coburning hazardous waste and Bevill raw materialsshould remain within the Bevill amendment provided that the character ofthe residues is determined by the Bevill material (i.e., the residue isnot significantly affected by burning the hazardous waste). (We explainbelow more precisely what we mean by these terms.) We believe that ourpresent data base for making these interpretations is not sufficient toensure that, in every case, the residue would not be significantly affectedby the hazardous waste.\20\\21\<NOTE/> Further, we have reconsidered whether the May 6, 1987, proposedinterpretation that residues generated by the subject devices when burningwaste for destruction are not within the Bevill amendment is consistentwith the stated principle.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ As noted above, the Agency also found that residues fromcofiring oil and gas with hazardous waste fuel were not within the scopeof the Bevill amendment because te residues' character would be determinedby firing hazardous waste. 50 FR 49190. Thus, all residuals from burninghazardous waste with gas in a boiler and bottom ash and fly ash from burninghazardous waste with oil in a boiler are outside of the Bevill amendment.This is because gas-fired boilers generate virtually no residues and oil-firedboilers generate little bottom or fly ash. In words of the statute, suchresidues result primarily from burning hazardous waste fuel, not from burningfossil fuels. This determination is not being reopened for public commentand the Agency is mentioning it only to accurately describe its past actions.<ITAG tagnum="28">\21\ See Memorandum to the Docket from Dwight Hlustick, EPA, datedMarch 11, 1988 summarizing available data on levels of toxic compoundsin cogenerated cement kiln dust, light-weight aggregate kiln emissionscontrol scrubber water and settling pond residue, and coal-fired boilercollected fly ash, and baseline (without burning/processing hazardous waste)levels in cement kiln dust, and coal-fired boiler collected fly ash.</ITAG>Thus, we are today taking two steps to address these issues. We are specificallyrequesting data on the levels of Appendix VIII toxic compounds in residuesfrom Bevill devices generated with and without burning or processing hazardouswaste. If adequate data are available, we may be able to make generic determinationsin some situations that the cogenerated residue is not significantly affectedby burning or processing the hazardous waste, and thus, remains withinthe Bevill amendment. Given that the effect of the hazardous waste on thecogenerated residue may be a function of site-specific factors (see discussionbelow), it may be difficult to make generic determinations in many cases.At a minimum, however, we would like to be able to establish generic baselinelevels of toxic compounds in the residues that reflect the compositionof residues <T3>without</T3> burning or processing hazardous waste. If baseline levelscan be established, each owner or operator would need only to determinethe levels of toxic compounds in the cogenerated residue and compare themto the established baseline levels.In addition, in the absence of data at this time to make supportable determinations,we are proposing to require case-by-case determinations of the effect ofcoburning on residuals. We believe that today's proposed approach is preferableto that proposed on May 6, 1987, because today's approach would focus onthe residues actually generated rather than on the purpose for which thehazardous waste is burned. A drawback to the May 6 proposal is that itwould not ensure that the residues generated continue to have the characterthat was the basis for the statutory exclusion pending completion of theSection 8002 studies. In addition, the Agency's historic approach to theissue of cogenerated residues has been to focus on the character of theresidues to ascertain what determines their character_the Bevill materialor the hazardous waste being burned. See 50 FR 49190, n. 87 (November 29,1987). The Agency also solicited comment on this approach_ focused on whatactually is in the residues_in the May 6 proposal. See 52 FR 17013. Thestatute itself does not directly specify that the purpose of the burningis a relevant criterion, but rather states that certain types of wasteare excluded from subtitle C pending completion of studies. The approachwe are proposing today is designated to ensure that the residues remainthese types of wastes in order for the exclusion to continue to apply.Accordingly, assuming that it is feasible to implement on a case-by-casebasis an approach that focuses on the type of residue generated by coburningsituations, we believe that this is the preferable approach. We elaboratebelow on how this determination could be made.As a preliminary matter, however, we note that it may be cumbersome tomake case-by-case determinations on the effect of coburning (and coprocessing)on residues. As discussed below, sufficient sampling and analyses wouldbe required of large volume residuals that often have levels of constituentsthat vary widely on a daily (or hourly) basis. Thus, we would prefer toobtain the data necessary to make generic determinations. Many factors,however, could have an impact on whether the residues from a particulardevice (e.g., cement kiln, light-weight aggregate kiln, boiler) are affectedby coburning. For example, the following factors could affect partitioningof metals to residues rather than to product or flue gases: \22\<NOTE/> (1) Waste feed rate; (2) levels and volatility of metalsin the waste; (3) physical form of the waste (liquid versus solid); and(4) waste feed system. Similarly, the following factors could affect levelsof organic constituents in the residues attributable to burning hazardouswaste: (1) Waste feed rate: (2) levels and types (e.g., difficulty of destruction,by-products formed) of toxic organics in the hazardous waste; (3) physicalform of the waste; and (4) waste feed system. In the absence of a sufficientdata base, and due to the cost of developing the extensive data base neededto make a generic determination, we believe we must rely on case-by-casedeterminations. We believe that, in the interim and absent documentationon impacts of coburning and coprocessing on residuals, the alternativeto case-by-case determinations could be to exclude such residuals fromthe Bevill Amendment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ We note that flue gases would be subject to regulationirrespective of the applicability of the Bevill Amendment to residues,unless the device is an industrial furnace processing indigenous wastesolely for reclamation.We discuss below how we propose to implement the stated principle on applicationof the Bevill amendment_coburning residues should remain within the exclusionprovided that the character of the residues is not significantly affectedby the hazardous waste.A. The Device Must Be a Bevill DeviceCongress intended to exclude, until further studies were completed, residuesfrom: (i) Devices that burn primarily fossil fuel; (ii) industrial furnacesprocessing ores or minerals; and (iii) cement kilns. Thus, to be eligiblefor exclusion from subtitile C regulation under the Bevill amendment, theresidue must be generated from a boiler burning primarily coal,\23\<NOTE/> an industrial furnace processing primarily ores or minerals(since otherwise residues could not be said to come from processing oresand minerals, but rather from processing some other material), or a cementkiln processing primarily raw materials. To implement objectively the provisionthat, to be eligible for the Bevill exclusion of residues, the device mustburn primarily Bevill material, we would require that a boiler must burnat least 50 percent coal, an industrial furnace \24\<NOTE/> must process at least 50 percent ores or minerals, and atleast 50 percent of the feedstock to a cement kiln must be raw materials.This requirement also confirms the Agency's long-standing interpretationthat the Bevill amendment applies only to primary facilities and not tosecondary facilities such as, for example, secondary smelters.\25\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Residues from gas and oil fired boilers are not withinthe scope of the Bevill amendment as discussed above in the text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Specific residues subject to the Bevill exclusion (i.e.,Mining Waste Exclusion) are listed in the April 17, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 15316.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ In support of this reading, one court has held that residuesfrom a secondary lead smelter are not covered by the Bevill amendment.Ilco Co. v. EPA (W.D. Ala. 1986).B. Determining if the Residue's Characteris Influenced by the Burning of Hazardous WasteAs discussed above, residues from cofiring hazardous waste with gas oroil in a boiler would remain outside of the Bevill amendment. For cogeneratedresidues in other situations, we are proposing to require a case-by-casedetermination as to whether the hazardous waste burning or processing significantlyaffects the character of the residue with respect to inorganic and organictoxic (i.e., appendix VIII) contaminants.\26\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ We note that the issue of the applicability of the Bevillamendment does not pertain to smelters processing indigenous waste. Insuch cases, the smelter is not coburning hazardous waste.To determine whether there is a significant increase in the level of anappendix VIII compound in the cogenerated residue compared to the baselineresidue generated without burning or processing hazardous waste, a numberof questions must be addressed, including: (1) What constitutes a representativebaseline residue (e.g., considering type, sources, and feed rates of normal_i.e.,nonwaste_feedstocks and fuels): (2) what constitutes a representative cogeneratedresidue (e.g., considering composition, physical form, and feed rate ofhazardous waste); (3) what sampling scheme is needed to ensure representativesamples for comparison between baseline and cogenerated residues; and,ultimately, (4) what constitutes a significant increase in contaminantlevels. We believe that the Agency needs to answer the first and fourthquestions, as discussed below. The second and third questions, however,are typically site-specific and, thus, can best be addressed by the owneror operator. The owner and operator should use their best judgment to obtainanalyses of representative samples. The approach should be based on, andbe consistent with, representative sampling protocols in SW-846, and mustbe documented by recordkeeping. The Agency solicits comment on how frequentlyand under what conditions residues should be retested over time.We note that it may not be necessary to obtain data on a site-specificbases. Rather, owners and operators may choose to use data from other representativefacilities to make generic determinations for particular devices underparticular conditions (see discussion above on factors that can affectgeneric determinations).We discuss next how we believe the other two questions should be addressed:How to establish baseline concentrations, and what constitutes a significantincrease in contaminant levels.1. <T3>Baseline Concentrations.</T3> As discussed above, we prefer to establishgeneric baseline residue concentrations of toxic (appendix VIII) compounds.We would use the limited available data (primarily on coal-fired boilerash and cement kiln dust) and additional data that may be forthcoming fromthe regulated community. If baseline concentrations were established ona site-specific basis, facilities cofiring with, for example, coal containingunusually high (for coal) levels of metals would be allowed to cogenerateresidues (within the scope of the Bevill amendment) that had higher metalslevels than residues cogenerated at another like facility cofiring coalwith unusually low (for coal) metals levels. Thus, facilities burning relative``clean'' fuels (and processing relatively clean raw materials) would beat a disadvantage.We specifically request information on concentrations of appendix VIIItoxic constituents in baseline (and cogenerated) residue. In addition,we request comments on how to established generic baseline concentrationsconsidering such issues as what concentration for a given toxic constituent(within the range of values for a particular residue generated by a particulartype of device) should be used as the generic value_for example, the meanvalue, 50th percentile value, or 90th percentile value.2. <T3>What Constitutes a Significant Increase.</T3> To determine whetheran increase is considered to be significant, we propose to use a two parttest. First, the increase must be statistically significant. We could usethe student's ``t'' test, ``F'' test, or some other statistical test asappropriate, at a 95 percent confidence level for the statistical test.We specifically request comment on whether this type of statistical testis appropriate.Second, if the cogenerated residue has statistically significant high levelsof appendix VIII compounds, we propose that a second test be consideredto determine whether the residue has been significantly affected_does thecogenerated residue pose a significantly increased health risk. We believethat consideration of health risk posed by these compounds is appropriatebecause Congress excluded residues from the subject devices based on theirpresumed high volume and low toxicity pending completion of the section8002 studies. Thus, we believe that the test of applicability of the Bevillexclusion should consider whether the compounds present at statisticallysignificant higher levels in the cogenerated residue are present at levelsof concern from a conservative human health perspective. An alternativereading on the applicability of the Bevill amendment, on which we alsorequest comment, would be to measure whether an increase is statisticallysignificant without regard to the health-based significance of the increase(which could be viewed as a decision relating to whether the wastes warrantregulation, rather than whether they are properly withing the scope ofthe Bevill amendment).We specifically request comment on whether it is appropriate to considera health-based <T3>de minimis</T3> level of concern when determining applicability ofthe Bevill amendment in these cogeneration situations, and, if so, howsuch <T3>de minimis</T3> levels could be established. For example, the followingapproach could be used. For metals for which EP Toxicity (see andSection;261.24) levels have been established, those levels could be used as <T3>de minimis</T3> levels. Under this approach, the cogenerated residuewould not be within the scope of the Bevill amendment if the levels ofEP Toxic metals are significantly higher in the cogenerated residue thanin the baseline residue and the cogenerated residue exhibited EP Toxicity.For appendix VIII compounds other than the metals covered by EP Toxicity,we could use an alternative approach. This would include other metals (i.e.,antimony, beryllium, nickel, and thallium), other inorganics that couldreasonably be expected to be in the waste, and organic compounds that couldreasonably be expected to be in the waste or that could result from incompletedestruction during the burning or processing.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ See Midwest Research Institute, ``Background InformationDocument for the Development of Regulations for PIC Emissions from HazardousWaste Incinerators,'' December, 1988.For these compounds, we could apply the Toxicity Characteristic LeachingProcedure (TCLP) codifed in appendix I, 40 CFR part 268 to obtain an extractor leachate from the residue.\28\<NOTE/> We could then conservatively assume that an individual actuallydrinks the leachate as his sole source of drinking water over a lifetimeto determine acceptable concentrations of toxic compounds. For noncarcinogeniccompounds, we could establish <T3>de minimis</T3> levels based on the RfD. For carcinogenic compounds,we could establish <T3>de minimis</T3> levels as those that could not result in an incrementallifetime cancer risk greater than 10^5.\29\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ We also request comment on whether, for organic compounds,the total concentration of the compound is the residue rather than theextract concentration should be used for the health-based test given thatthe purpose of burning toxic organic compounds in these devices shouldbe to destroy the compounds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ A draft compilation of health-based concentrations foruse in determining applicability of the Bevill exclusion has been madefor approximately 150 compounds based on EP Toxicity levels, maximum concentrationlevels, RfDs, and RSDs. See memorandum to the Docket from Dwight Hlustick,EPA, dated June 6, 1989.We also solicit comment on whether less conservative approaches shouldbe adopted. Our concern is that any such approaches-for example, involvingsite-specific modeling_would not be self-implementing. The virtue of theapproach outline above is easy implementability plus a clear way of showingwhether the residue's character results from burning hazardous waste ofBevill materials.C. Regulatory Impact of Today's ProposalThe foregoing discussion is not intended to change automatically at thistime the regulatory status of residues from Bevill devices that burn orprocess hazardous waste. In most cases, EPA expects that these wastes'character is indeed determined by processing or burning the Bevill rawmaterial. Thus, in the absence of data indicating otherwise, the policiesregarding applicability of the Bevill amendment to cogenerated residuesprovided by the November 29, 1985, final rule and the May 6, 1987, proposedrule, as discussed above, remain in effect. EPA intends today's discussionto begin to gather the necessary data and to obatin comment on alternativeapproaches on which to base a more precise and workable test for determiningwhether a cogenerated residue remains within the scope of the Bevill amendment.Based on comment on today's discussion and additional Agency analysis,we hope to be in a position to develop a definitive test of Bevill applicability.Ideally, the Agency will establish a final rule on Bevill applicabilitywhen the boiler and industrial furnace standards are promulgated.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Applicability of the Sham Recycling Policy</ITAG>On March 16, 1983, EPA published an Enforcement Guidance (FR 11157) whichprovided guidance on burning low energy hazardous waste, ostensibly forenergy recovery, in boilers and industrial furnaces. This guidance hasbeen referred to as EPA's Sham Recycling Policy. This policy stated thatwhen hazardous waste having a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb is burnedin boilers or industrial furnaces, EPA generally considers the practiceto be burning for destruction (i.e., incineration) rather than exempt burningfor energy recovery. The proposed rules for boilers and industrial furnacesburning hazardous waste would apply to those devices irrespective of thepurpose of burning. Thus, the proposed rules would supersede the sham recyclingpolicy. A question has been raised regarding the status of the sham recyclingpolicy in the interim between the time the rules are ultimately promulgatedand a facility is issued a Part B permit.The Agency is considering three options in this case. The first optionis to rescind the sham recycling policy on the effective date of the finalboiler/furnace regulations. As a result, industrial furnaces and boilerscould begin burning low heating value hazardous waste at that time. Thesecond alternative is to rescind the sham recycling policy when a facilitycomes into compliance with the interim status emission standards. In thiscase, the facility could commence burning low heating value hazardous wasteduring interim status once it complies with the emissions standards.The last alternative is to have the sham recycling policy remain in effectuntil a Part B permit is issued. The Part B permit would address finalemission and other standards, and the facility would have completed anytrial burn or other emission testing requirements in conjunction with permitwriter oversight.EPA specifically requests comments on these alternatives for rescindingthe sham recycling policy.Regardless of which alternative EPA selects, the sham recycling policywould not apply during the trial burn required to receive a Part B permitor during test burns conducted specifically in preparation for the trialburn. This exclusion is needed to ensure that the facility has the opportunityto conduct a successful trial burn using the wastes for which it wishesto be permitted. The permitting authority will have final approval of thewaste types, waste quantities, and facility operating conditions when lowheating value (less than 5,000 BTU/lb) wastes are burned in preparationfor, and during, the trial burn.<ITAG tagnum="85">XII. Regulation of Direct Transfer of Hazardous Waste from a TransportVehicle to a Boiler or Industrial Furnace</ITAG>Some permitting authorities have expressed concern about the practice offeeding hazardous waste fuels directly from transport vehicles (e.g., 6,000gallon tankers) to industrial furnaces such as cement kilns. Although theseoperations may be exempt under andSection; 261.6(c)(2) from the storage standardsprovided by parts 264 and 265, some permit authorities are concerned about:(1) The potential for fires, explosions, and spills during transfer operations;and (2) the potential for waste fuel flow interruptions and stratificationof waste in the transport container which, in turn, could affect the abilityof the burner to consistently provide efficient combustion of the waste.Approaches to address these issues are discussed below.In situations where permit writers believe that such transfer operationspose a substantial risk of fires, explosions, or spills that is not adequatelyaddressed by applicable regulatory controls, the permit writer should usethe omnibus authority under section 3005(c)(3) of RCRA codified at andSection;270.32(b)(2) to provide additional permit conditions as may be necessaryto protect human health and the environment.With respect to the concern about fuel flow interruptions and waste stratificationand the resultant effects on combustion efficiency, we request commenton whether blending and surge storage tanks should be required at all facilitiesburning hazardous waste. This is common practice at the vast majority offacilities. In fact, it could be argued that the primary reason that thepractice of direct transfer from the transport vehicle to the burner isused at some cement kiln facilities in lieu of using a fixed blending/storagetank is to avoid the need to obtain a permit for the storage tank. (Hazardouswaste fuel storage operations not ``in existence'' on May 29, 1986, andthus, not eligible for interim status, must obtain a part 264, part B permitbefore they can operate.)<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII.

The quantity of toxic organic compoundsemitted depends on the concentration of the compounds in the waste, andthe combustion conditions under which the waste is burned.Data on typical PIC emissions from hazardous waste combustion sources werecompiled and assessed in recent EPA studies.\30\<NOTE/>,\31\<NOTE/> These studies identified 37 individual compounds in the stackgas of the eight full-scale hazardous waste incinerators tested, out ofwhich 17 were volatile compounds and 20 semivolatile compounds. Eight volatilecompounds (benzene, toluene, chloroform, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride,tetrachloroethylene, chlorobenzene, and methylene chloride), and one semivolatilecompound (naphthalene) were identified most frequently in over 50 percentof the tests. It was found that PIC emission rates vary widely from site-to-sitewhich may be due, in part, to variations in waste feed composition andfacility size. The median values of the nine compounds mentioned aboverange from 0.27 to 5.0 mg/min. Using a representative emission rate of1 mg/min, the stack gas concentration of PICs in a medium-sized facility(250 m3/min combustion gas flow rate) would be 4 andCx.18;g/m3 (0.004 andCx.18;g/l).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Wallace, D. et al., ``Products of Incomplete Combustionfrom Hazardous Waste Combustion,'' Draft Final Report, EPA Contract No.68-03-3241, Acurex Corporation, Subcontractor No. ES 59689A, Work Assignment5, Midwest Research Institute Project No. 8371-L(1), Kansas City, MO, June1986.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Trenholm, A., and C.C. Lee, ``Analysis of PIC and TotalMass Emissions from an Incinerator,'' Proceedings of the Twelfth AnnualResearch Symposium on Land Disposal, Remedial Action, Incineration, andTreatment of Hazardous Waste, Cincinnati, OH, April 21-23, 1986, EPA/600-9-86/022,pp. 376-381, August 1986.The health risk posed by PIC emissions depends on the quantity and toxicityof the individual toxic components of the emissions, and the ambient levelsto which persons are exposed. Estimates of risk to public health resultingfrom PICs, based on available emissions data, indicate that PIC emissionsdo not pose significant risks when incinerators are operated under optimumconditions. However, limited information about PICs is available. PIC emissionsare composed of thousands of different compounds, some of which are invery minute quantities and cannot be detected and quantified without veryelaborate and expensive sampling and analytical (Sandamp;A) techniques. Suchelaborate Sandamp;A work is not feasible in trial burns for permitting purposesand can only be done in research tests. In addition, reliable Sandamp;A proceduressimply do not exist for some types of PICs (e.g., water-soluble compounds).The most comprehensive analysis of PIC emissions from a hazardous wasteincinerator identified and quantified only approximately 70 percent oforganic emissions. Typical research-oriented field tests identify a muchlower fraction_from 1-60 percent. Even if all the organic compounds emittedcould be quantified, there are inadequate health effects data availableto assess the resultant health risk. EPA believes that, due to the abovelimitations, additional testing will not, in the foreseeable future, beable to prove quantitatively whether PICs do or do not pose unacceptablehealth risk. Considering the uncertainties about PIC emissions and theirpotential risk to public health, it is therefore prudent to require thatboilers and industrial furnaces operate at a high combustion efficiencyto minimize PIC emissions. Given that carbon monoxide (CO) is the bestavailable indicator of combustion efficiency, and a conservative indicatorof combustion upset, we are proposing to limit the flue gas CO levels tolevels that ensure PIC emissions are not likely to pose unacceptable healthrisk. In cases where CO concentrations exceed the proposed <T3>de minimis</T3> limit, higher CO levels would be allowed under twoalternative approaches: (1) If total hydrocarbon (THC) concentrations inthe stack gas do not exceed a good operating practice-based limit of 20ppmv; or (2) if the applicant demonstrates that THC emissions are not likelyto pose unacceptable health risk using conservative, prescribed risk assessmentprocedures. Although we prefer the technology-based approach for reasonsdiscussed in the text, we are requesting comment on the health-based alternativeas well.Use of CO Limits to Ensure Good Combustion ConditionsBy definition, low CO flue gas levels are indicative of a boiler or industrialfurnace (or any combustion device) operating at high combustion efficiency.Operating at high combustion efficiency helps ensure minimum emissionsof unburned (or incompletely burned) organics.\32\<NOTE/> In a simplified view of combustion of hazardous waste, thefirst stage is immediate thermal decomposition of the POHCs in the flameto form other, usually smaller, compounds, also referred to as PICs. ThesePICs are generally rapidly decomposed to form CO.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Given that CO is a gross indicator of combustion performance,limiting CO may not absolutely minimize PIC emissions. This is becausePICs can result from small pockets within the combustion zone where adequatetime, temperature, and turbulence have not been provided to oxidize completelythe combustion products of the POHCs. Available data, however, indicatethat PIC emissions do not pose significant risk when combustion devicesare operated at high combustion efficiency. EPA is conducting additionalfield and pilot scale testing to address this issue.The second stage of combustion involves the oxidation of CO to CO<T2>2</T2> (carbon dioxide). The CO to CO<T2>2</T2> step is the slowest (rate controlling) step in the combustionprocess because CO is considered to be more thermally stable (difficultto oxidize) than other intermediate products of combustion of hazardouswaste constituents. Since fuel is being fired continuously, both combustionstages are occurring simultaneously.Using this view of waste combustion, CO flue gas levels cannot be correlatedto DRE for POHCs and may not correlate well with PIC destruction. As discussedbelow, test data shown no correlation between CO and DRE, but do show aslight apparent correlation between CO and chlorinated PICs, and a faircorrelation between CO and total unburned hydrocarbons. Low CO is an indicatorof the status of the CO to CO<T2>2</T2> conversion process, the last, rate-limiting oxidation process.Since oxidation of CO to CO<T2>2</T2> occurs after destruction of the POHC and its (other) intermediates(PICs), the absence of CO is a useful indication of POHC and PIC destruction.The presence of high levels of CO in the flue gas is a useful indicationof inefficient combustion and, at some level of elevated CO flue gas concentration,an indication of failure of the PIC and POHC destruction process. We believeit is necessary to limit CO levels to levels indicative of high combustionefficiency because we do not know the precise CO level that is indicativeof significant failure of the PIC and POHC destruction process. It is possiblethat the critical CO level may be dependent on site-specific and event-specificfactors (e.g., fuel type, air-to-fuel ratios, rate and extent of changeof these and other factors that affect combustion efficiency). We believelimiting CO levels is prudent because: (1) It is a widely practiced approachto improving and monitoring combustion efficiency; and (2) most well designedand operated boilers and industrial furnaces can easily be operated inconformance with the proposed Tier I CO limit of 100 ppmv.The Tier I CO limit of 100 ppmv would be specified in the permit even when(though) the CO levels during the trial burn were lower. EPA consideredthis issue carefully and the proposal is based on three considerations.First, permitting a CO level of 100 ppmv will not cause destruction andremoval efficiencies to be less than the required 99.99 percent. Second,many combustion devices run very efficiently during a trial burn and achieveCO emissions under 10 ppmv. It may be difficult to achieve that high degreeof efficiency on a consistent basis and specifying such low trial burnCO values may result in numerous unnecessary hazardous waste feed cut-offsdue to CO exceedances. Third, the emission of PICs from incinerators hasnot been shown to increase linearly at such low CO levels. In fact, thetrial burn data indicate that total organic emissions are consistentlylow (i.e., at levels that pose acceptable health risk) when CO emissionlevels are less than 100 ppmv. Two studies show that no measurable changein DRE is likely to occur for CO levels up to 100 ppmv. The first studygenerated data from combustion of a 12 component mixture in a bench scalefacility.\33\<NOTE/> The CO levels ranged from 15 to 522 ppm without a significantcorrelation to the destruction efficiency for the compounds investigated.The second study was conducted on a pilot scale combustor.\34\<NOTE/> Test runs were conducted with average CO concentrations rangingfrom 30 to 700 ppmv. When the concentration was less than 220 ppmv, noapparent decrease in DRE was noticed, but higher CO concentrations showeda definite decrease in DRE. EPA specifically invites comments on whetherthe permit should limit CO according to actual trial burn values in lieuof the limits specified here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Hall D.L. et al, ``Thermal Decomposition Properties ofa Twelve Component Organic Mixture'', Hazardous Wastes andamp; HazardousMaterials, Vol. 3, No. 4 pp 441-449, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Waterland, L.R. ``Pilot-scale Investigation of SurrogateMeans of Determining POHC Destruction'' Final Report for the Chemical Manufacturers'Association, ACUREX Corporation, Mountain View, California, July 1983.SupportingInformation on CO as a Surrogate for PICsSubstantial information is available that indicate CO emissions may relateto PIC emissions.Combustion efficiency is directly related to CO by the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s25,26,1,25,6,r25</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Combustion Efficiency (CE) </H1><H1>=</H1><H1>percent CO</H1><T2>2</T2><H2>percent CO</H2><T2>2</T2>+percent CO <H1>(100)</H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>CE has been used as a measure of completeness of combustion.\3\\5\<NOTE/> EPA's regulations for incineration of waste PCBs at 40 CFR761.70 require that combustion efficiency be maintained above 99.9 percent.As combustion becomes less efficient or less complete, at some point, theemission of total organics will increase and smoke will eventually result.It is probable that some quantity of toxic organic compounds will be presentin these organic emissions. Thus, CE or CO levels provide an indicationof the potential for total organic emissions and possibly toxic PICs. Dataare not available, however, to correlate these variables quantitativelywith PICs in combustion processes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ We specifically request comments on whether combustionefficiency, as defined above in the text (i.e., considering both CO andCO<T2>2</T2> emissions) should be used to control PIC emissions rather thanCO alone.Several studies have been conducted to evaluate CO monitoring as a methodto measure the performance of hazardous waste combustion. Though correlationswith destruction efficiency of POHCs have not been found, the data fromthese studies generally show that as combustion conditions deteriorate,both CO and total hydrocarbon emissions increase. These data support therelation between CO and increased organic emissions discussed above. Inone of these studies,\3\\6\<NOTE/> an attempt was made to correlate the concentrations of COwith the concentrations of four common PICs (benzene, toluene, carbon tetrachloride,and trichloroethylene) in stack gases of full scale incinerators. For aplot of CO versus benzene, one of the most common PICs, there is considerablescatter in the data indicating that parameters other than CO affect thebenzene levels. However, there is a trend in the data that suggests thatwhen benzene levels are high, CO levels also are high. The converse hasnot been found to be true; when benzene levels are low, CO levels are notalways low. Similar trends were observed for toluene and carbon tetrachloride,but not for trichloroethylene. In the pilot-scale study by Waterland citedearlier, similar trends were observed for chlorobenzene and methylene chlorideand in another study \3\\7\<NOTE/> similar trends were observed for total chlorinated PICs.These data support the conclusion that when the emission rates of somecommonly identified PICs are sufficiently high, it is likely that CO emissionswill also be higher than typical levels.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ Trenholm, A., P.

The converse may not be true:when CO is high, PIC levels may or may not be high. Thus, the Agency believesthat CO is a conservative indicator of potential PIC emissions and, giventhat CO monitoring is already required in the present regulations, theemission levels should be limited to low levels indicative of high combustionefficiency. (For those facilities where CO emissions may be high but PICemissions low, we are providing an opportunity under Tier II of the proposedrule to demonstrate that, in fact, PIC emissions pose acceptable healthrisks at elevated CO levels.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix B: Emission Screening Limits for Total Hydrocarbons (mg/s)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,xl10,xl20,xl20,xl20</C> <H1>Terrain adjusted effective stack height (meters)</H1><H1>Noncomplex terrain</H1><H2>Urban land use</H2><H2>Rural land use</H2><H1>Complex terrain</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>5.4E+01</D><D>2.8E+01</D><D>1.3E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>6.1E+01</D><D>3.2E+01</D><D>1.9E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>6.9E+01</D><D>3.6E+01</D><D>2.7E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10<D>7.7E+01</D><D>4.2E+01</D><D>4.0E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12<D>8.8E+01</D><D>5.1E+01</D><D>4.9E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14<D>9.9E+01</D><D>6.2E+01</D><D>6.0E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16<D>1.1E+02</D><D>7.7E+01</D><D>6.9E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18<D>1.3E+02</D><D>8.6E+01</D><D>7.7E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20<D>1.4E+02</D><D>1.2E+02</D><D>8.5E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22<D>1.6E+02</D><D>1.5E+02</D><D>9.4E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24<D>1.8E+02</D><D>1.9E+02</D><D>1.0E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26<D>2.0E+02</D><D>2.5E+02</D><D>1.2E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28<D>2.3E+02</D><D>3.1E+02</D><D>1.3E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30<D>2.6E+02</D><D>4.0E+02</D><D>1.4E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35<D>3.4E+02</D><D>6.3E+02</D><D>1.8E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40<D>4.3E+02</D><D>9.6E+02</D><D>2.2E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45<D>5.4E+02</D><D>1.3E+03</D><D>2.7E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50<D>7.0E+02</D><D>1.8E+03</D><D>3.3E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">55<D>8.8E+02</D><D>2.3E+03</D><D>4.1E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">60<D>1.1E+03</D><D>3.1E+03</D><D>5.0E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">65<D>1.3E+03</D><D>4.1E+03</D><D>6.2E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70<D>1.5E+03</D><D>4.9E+03</D><D>6.9E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75<D>1.7E+03</D><D>5.8E+03</D><D>7.7E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">80<D>1.9E+03</D><D>6.9E+03</D><D>8.6E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85<D>2.2E+03</D><D>8.2E+03</D><D>9.7E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90<D>2.5E+03</D><D>9.7E+03</D><D>1.1E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95<D>2.8E+03</D><D>1.2E+04</D><D>1.2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>3.2E+03</D><D>1.4E+04</D><D>1.4E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105<D>3.6E+03</D><D>1.6E+04</D><D>1.5E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110<D>4.1E+03</D><D>2.0E+04</D><D>1.7E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115<D>4.6E+03</D><D>2.3E+04</D><D>1.9E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">120<D>5.3E+03</D><D>2.8E+04</D><D>2.1E+03 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix C: Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoringof Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen in Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Boilers,and Industrial Furnaces</ITAG>1.0 Applicability and Principle1.1 <T3>Applicability.</T3> This specification is to be used for evaluatingthe acceptability of carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (02) continuous emissionmonitoring systems (CEMS) installed on hazardous waste incinerators, boilers,and industrial furnaces.This specification is intended to be used in evaluating the acceptabilityof the CEMS at the time of or soon after installation and at other timesas specified in the regulations. This specification is not designed toevaluate the CEMS performance over an extended period of time nor doesit identify specific routine calibration techniques and other auxiliaryprocedures to assess CEMS performance. The source owner or operator, however,is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS.1.2 <T3>Principle.</T3> Installation and measurement location specifications,performance and equipment specifications, test procedures, and data reductionprocedures are included in this specification. Relative accuracy (RA) tests,calibration error (Ec) tests, calibration drift (CD) tests, and responsetime (RT) tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS withthe specification.2.0 Definitions2.1 <T3>Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS).</T3> The CEMS comprisesall the equipment used to generate data and includes the sample extractionand transport hardware, the analyzer(s), and the data recording/processinghardware (and software).2.2 <T3>Continuous.</T3> A continuous monitor is one in which the sample tobe analyzed passes the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption,and, which evaluates the detector response to the sample at least onceeach 15 seconds and which computes and records the results at least every60 seconds.2.2.1 <T3>Hourly Rolling Average</T3>. An hourly rolling average is the arithmeticmean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values recorded by the continuousmonitoring system.2.3 <T3>Monitoring System Types</T3>. There are three basic types of monitoringsystems: extractive, cross-stack, and in-situ. Carbon monoxide monitoringgenerally are extractive or cross-stack, while oxygen monitors are eitherextractive or in-situ.2.3.1 <T3>Extractive</T3>. Extractive systems use a pump or other mechanical,pneumatic, or hydraulic means to draw a small portion of the stack or fluegas and convey it to the remotely located analyzer.2.3.2 <T3>In-situ</T3>. In-situ analyzers place the sensing or detecting elementdirectly in the flue gas stream and thus perform the analysis without removinga sample from the stack.2.3.3 <T3>Cross-stack</T3>. Cross-stack analyzers measure the parameter of interestby placing a source beam on one side of the stack and either the detector(in single-pass instruments) or a retro-reflector (in double-pass instruments)on the other side and measuring the parameter of interest (e.g., CO) bythe attenuation of the beam by the gas in its path.2.4 <T3>Span</T3>. The upper limit of the gas concentration measurement range.2.5 <T3>Instrument Range</T3>. The maximum and minimum concentration that canbe measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumedto be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum. If a single analyzeris used, for measuring multiple ranges, (either manually or automatically),the performance standards expressed as a percentage of full scale applyto all ranges.2.6 <T3>Calibration Drift</T3>. Calibration drift is the change in the responseor output of an instrument from a reference value over time. Drift is measuredby comparing the responses to a reference standard over time with no adjustmentof instrument settings.2.7 <T3>Response Time</T3>. The response time of a system or part of a systemis the amount of time between a step change in the system input (e.g, changeof calibration gas) until the data recorder displays 95 percent of thefinal value.2.8 <T3>Accuracy</T3>. Accuracy is a measure of agreement between a measuredvalue and an accepted or true value and is usually expressed as the percentagedifference between the true and measured values relative to the true value.For this performance specification, the accuracy is checked by conductinga calibration error (Ec) test and a relative accuracy (RA) test.2.8.1 <T3>Calibration Error</T3>. Calibration error is a measure of the deviationof a measured value at the analyzer mid range from a reference value.2.8.2 <T3>Relative Accuracy</T3>. Relative accuracy is the comparison of theCEMS response to a value measured by a reference test method (RM). Theapplicable reference test methods are Method 10 (Determination of CarbonMonoxide from Stationary Sources) and Method 3 (Gas Analysis for CarbonMonoxide, Oxygen Excess Air, and Dry Molecular Weight). These methods arefound in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.3.0 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications3.1 <T3>CEMS Measurement Location</T3>. The best or optimum location of thesample interface for the monitoring system is determined by a number offactors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, thedegree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to whichit represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents thecombustion situation in the firebox. The location should be as free fromin-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flowdisturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent ductdiameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutantgeneration, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentrationor emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameters upstream from the exhaustor control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1.The sample path of sample point(s) should include the concentric inner50 percent of the stack or duct cross section. For circular ducts, thisis 0.707 andmultiply; diameter and a single-point probe, therefore, shouldbe located between 0.141 andmultiply; diameter and 0.839 andmultiply; diameterfrom the stack wall and a multiple-point probe should have sample inletsin this region. A location which meets both the diameter and the cross-sectioncriteria will be acceptable.If these criteria are not achievable of if the location is otherwise lessthan optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated.To check for stratification, the oxygen concentration should also be measuredas verification of oxygen in-leakage. For rectangular ducts, at least ninesample points located at the center of similarly shaped, equal area divisionof the cross section should be used. For circular ducts, 12 sample points(i.e., six points on each of the two perpendicular diameter) should beused, locating the points as described in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method1. Calculate the mean value for all sample points and select the point(s)or path that provides a value equivalent to the mean. For these purposes,if no single value is more than 15 percent different from the mean andif no two single values are different from each other by more than 20 percentof the mean, then the gas can be assumed homogeneous and can be sampledanywhere. The point(s) or path should be within the inner 50 percent ofthe area.Both the oxygen and CO monitors should be installed at the same locationor very close to each other. If this is not possible, they may be installedat different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations arenot stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.3.2 <T3>Reference Method (RM) Measurement Location and Traverse Points</T3>.Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement point at least twoequivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the pointof pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutantconcentration or emission rate may occur, and at least a half equivalentdiameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutantconcentration changes are due solely to oxygen in-leakage (e.g., air heaterleakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at thesame location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters.The CEMS and RM locations need not be the same. Then select traverse pointsthat assure acquisition of representative samples over the stack or ductcross section. The minimum requirements are as follows: Establish a ``measurementline'' that passes through the centroidal area and in the direction ofany expected stratification. If this line interferes with the CEM measurements,displace the line up to 30 cm (or 5 percent of the equivalent diameterof the cross section, whichever is less) from the centroidal area. Locatethree traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurementline. If the measurement line is longer than 2.4 m and pollutant stratificationis not expected, the tester may choose to locate the three tranverse pointson the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 m from the stack or duct wall. This optionmust not be used at points where two streams with different pollutant concentrationsare combined. The tester may select other traverse points, provided thatthey can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide arepresentative sample over the stack or duct cross section. Conduct allnecessary RM tests within 3 cm (but not less than 3 cm from the stack orduct wall) of the traverse points.4.0 Monitoring System Performance SpecificationsTable C-1 summarizes the performance standards for the continuous monitoringsystems. Each of the items is discussed in the following paragraphs. Twosets of standards for CO are given_one for low range measurement and anotherfor high range measurement since the proposed CO limits are dual range.The high range standards relate to measurement and quantification of shortduration high concentration peaks, while the low range standards relateto the overall average operating condition of the incinerator. The dual-rangespecification can be met either by using two separate analyzers, one foreach range, or by using dual range units which have the capability of meetingboth standards with a single unit. In the latter case, when the readinggoes above the full scale measurement value of the lower range, the higherrange operation will be started automatically.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> C-1._<T4>Performance Specifications of CO and Oxygen Monitors</T4><H1>Parameter</H1><H1>CO monitors</H1><H2>Low range</H2><H2>High range</H2><H1>Oxygen monitors</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Calibration drift 24 h<D>andgreater;5% FS \1\</D><D>andgreater;5% FS</D><D>andgreater;0.5% O2.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Calibration error \2\<D>andgreater;5% FS</D><D>andgreater;5% FS</D><D>andgreater;0.5% O2.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Response time<D>andgreater;1.5 min</D><D>andgreater;1.5 min</D><D>andgreater;1.5 min.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Relative accuracy<D>andgreater;The greater of 10% of RM or 20ppm</D><D/><D>andgreater;The greater of 20% of RM or 1.0% O2.</D><F>\1\ FS means full scale measurement range.</F><F>\2\ Expressed as the sum of the mean absolute value plus the 95% confidenceinterval of a series of measurements.</F></ITAG></ITAG>4.1 <T3>CEMS Span Values.</T3> The span values shown below in Table C-2 areto be established for the continuous emission monitoring systems.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s50,r10,r10,6</C><T4>Table</T4> C-2._<T4>CEMS Span Values for CO and Oxygen Monitors</T4><H1> </H1><H1>CO monitors</H1><H2>Low range (ppm)</H2><H2>High range (ppm)</H2><H1> Oxygen monitors (%)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 1 rolling average format<D>200</D><D>3,000</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 1 alternate format<D>200</D><D>3,000</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 2 rolling average format<D>2andmultiply;permit limit</D><D>3,000</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 2 alternate format<D>2andmultiply;permit limit</D><D>1.1andmultiply;permitted peak value</D><D>25</D></ITAG></ITAG>4.2 <T3>System Measurement Range.</T3> In order to measure both the high andlow concentrations consistently with the same or similar degree of accuracy,system measurement range maximum span specifications are given for boththe low and high range monitors. The system measurement range chosen isbased upon the permitted level and the span value presented in section4.1.The owner or operator must choose a measurement range that includes zeroand a high-level value. The high-level value is chosen by the source ownerand operator as follows:1. For the low range CO measurement, the high level value is set between1.5 times the permit limit and the span value specified in section 4.1.2. For the high range CO measurements, except for Tier 2, alternate format,the high level value is set between 2000 ppm as a minimum and the spanvalue specified in section 4.1.3. For the high range CO measurement under Tier 2 using the alternate format,the high level value is set at the span value specified in section 4.1.4. For oxygen, the high level value is set between 1.5 times the highestlevel measured during the trial burn and the span value specified in section4.1.The calibration gas, or gas cell values used to establish the data recorderscale should produce the zero and high level values.4.3 <T3>Response Time.</T3> The mean response time for the CO monitor(s) shouldnot exceed 1.5 minutes to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.For the oxygen monitor, the mean response time should not exceed 15 minto achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.4.4 <T3>Calibration Drift.</T3> The CEMS calibration must not drift or deviatefrom the reference value of the gas cylinder or gas cell by more than 5percent full scale in 24 hr for the CO low range and the CO high range.For oxygen the calibration drift must be less than 0.5 percent O<T2>2</T2> in 24 hr. The calibration drift specification must not be exceededfor six out of the seven test days required during the test (see Section5 for the test procedures).4.5 <T3>Calibration Error.</T3> The calibration error specification evaluatesthe system accuracy at the midpoint of the measurement range by the calibrationerror test described in Section 6. The test determines the difference betweenthe measured value and the expected value at this midpoint.The calibration error of the CEMS must not exceed 5 percent full scalefor CO. The calibration error of the oxygen CEMS must not exceed 0.5 percentO<T2>2</T2>.4.6 <T3>Relative Accuracy.</T3> The relative accuracy (RA) of the carbon monoxideCEMS must not exceed 10 percent of the mean value of the reference method(RM) test data or 20 ppm CO, whichever is greater. Note that during therelative accuracy test, the CO level may exceed the full scale of the lowrange monitor. When this occurs, the mean CEMS measurement value shouldbe calculated using the appropriate data from both the low range and highrange monitors.The relative accuracy of the oxygen CEMS must not exceed 20 percent ofthe mean value of the RM test data or 1 percent oxygen, whichever is greater.5.0 Performance Specification Test Period5.1 <T3>Pretest Preparation.</T3> Install the CEMS, prepare the RM test siteaccording to the specifications in Section 3, and prepare the CEMS foroperation according to the manufacturer's written instructions.5.2 <T3>Calibration Drift Test Period.</T3> Prior to initiating the calibrationdrift tests conduct the calibration error test and the response time testaccording to the test procedures established in Section 6. The carbon monoxideand oxygen (if applicable) monitoring systems must be evaluated separately.5.3 <T3>Calibration Drift Test Period.</T3> The monitoring system should beoperated for some time before attempting drift checks because most systemsneed a period of equilibration and adjustment before the performance isreasonably stable. At least one week (168 hr) of continuous operation isrecommended before attempting drift tests.While the facility is operating at normal conditions, determine the magnitudeof the calibration drift (CD) once each day (at 24-hr intervals) for sevenconsecutive days according to the procedure given in section 6. The carbonmonoxide and oxygen (if applicable) monitoring systems must be evaluatedseparately.5.4 <T3>RA Test Period.</T3> Conduct the RA test according to the proceduregiven in section 6 while the facility is operating at normal conditions.The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period. The RA test maybe conducted separately for each of the monitors (carbon monoxide and oxygen,if applicable) or may be conducted as a combined test so that the resultsare calculated only for the corrected CO concentration (i.e., CO correctedto 7 percent oxygen); the latter approach is preferred.6.0 Performance Specification Test Procedures.6.1 <T3>Response Time.</T3> The response time tests apply to all types of monitors,but will generally have significance only for extractive systems. The entiresystem is checked with this procedure including sample extraction and transport(if applicable), sample conditioning (if applicable), gas analyses, andthe data recording.Introduce zero gas into the system. For extractive systems, the calibrationgases should be introduced at the probe as near to the sample locationas possible. For in-situ systems, introduce the zero gas at the sampleinterface so that all components active in the analysis are tested. Whenthe system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of fullscale for 30 s), switch to monitor stack effluent and wait for a stablevalue. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percentof the final stable value. Next, introduce a high level calibration gasand repeat the above procedure (stable, switch to sample, stable, record).Repeat the entire procedure three times and determine the mean upscaleand downscale response times. The slower or longer of the two means isthe system response time.6.2 <T3>Calibration Error Test</T3>6.2.1 <T3>Procedure.</T3> The procedure for testing calibration error is to setthe instrument zero and span with the appropriate standards and then repeatedlymeasure a standard in the middle of the range. In order to minimize biasfrom previous analyses, the sequence of standard introduction should alternatebetween high and low standards prior to the mid-level standard (e.g., high,mid, low, mid, high, mid, low, mid, etc.) until six analyses of the mid-levelstandard are obtained, with three values obtained from upscale approachand three values obtained from downscale approach.The differences between the measured instrument output and the expectedoutput of the reference standards are used as the data points.62.2 <T3>Calculations.</T3> Summarize the results on a data sheet. For eachof the six measurements made, calculate the arithmetic difference betweenthe midpoint reference value and the measured value. Then calculate themean of the difference, standard deviation, confidence coefficient, andcalibration error using Equations 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 2-4 presented in Section7.6.3 <T3>Zero and Span Calibration Drift.</T3> The purpose of the calibrationdrift (CD) checks is to determine the ability of the CEMS to maintain itscalibration over a specified period of time. The performance specificationsestablish a standard related to span drift. Each drift test is conductedseven times and the system(s) are allowed to exceed the limit once duringthe test.During the drift tests, no adjustment of the system is permitted exceptthose automatic internal adjustments which are part of the automatic compensationcircuits integral to the analyzer. If periodic automatic adjustments aremade to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the daily CD testimmediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way thatthe CD can be determined (calculated). Subsequent CEMS operation must includethe same system configuration as used during the performance testing.Select a reference gas with a CO or O<T2>2</T2> concentration between 80 and 100 percent of the full-scale measurementrange of the analyzer; ambient air (20.9 percent O<T2>2</T2>) may be used as the reference gas for oxygen. The zero gas shouldcontain the lowest concentration recommended by the manufacturer. Priorto the test, calibrate the instrument. At the beginning of the test, introducethe selected zero and span reference gases (or cells or filters). After24 hr and at 24-hr intervals thereafter, alternately introduce both thezero and span reference gases, wait until a stable reading is obtainedand record the values reported by the system. Subtract the recorded CEMSresponse from the reference value. Repeat this procedure for 7 days, obtainingeight values of zero and span gas measurements (the initial values andseven 24-hr readings). The difference between the established or referencevalue for the span and the measured value may not exceed the specificationsin Table 4.1 more than once, and the average value must not exceed thespecification.6.4 <T3>Relative Accuracy Test Procedure</T3>6.4.1 <T3>Sampling Strategy for RM Test.</T3> Conduct the RM tests in such away that they will yield results representative of the emissions from thesource and can be correlated to the CEMS data. Although it is preferableto conduct the oxygen, moisture (if needed), and CO measures simultaneously,the diluent and moisture measurements that are taken within a 30- to 60-minperiod which includes the pollutant measurements, may be used to calculatedry pollutant concentration corrected to 7 percent O<T2>2</T2>. For each run, make a sample traverse of at least 21 min, samplingfor 7 min per point.6.4.2 <T3>Correlation of RM and CEMS Data.</T3> Correlate the CEMS and the RMtest data as to the time and duration by first determining from the CEMSfinal output (the one used for reporting) the integrated average pollutantconcentration during each pollutant RM test period. Consider system responsetime, if important, and confirm that the pair of results are on a consistentmoisture, temperature, and diluent concentration basis. Then, compare eachintegrated CEMS value against the corresponding average RM value. Makea direct comparison of the RM results and CEMS integrated average value.When oxygen monitoring is required by the regulation to calculate carbonmonoxide normalized to 7 percent O<T2>2</T2>, the RM test results should be calculated and compared on thisbasis. This is, the CO concentrations normalized to 7 percent O<T2>2</T2> measured by the CEMS.6.4.3 <T3>Number of RM Tests.</T3> Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessaryRM tests. The tester may choose to perform more than nine sets of RM tests.If this option is chosen, the tester may, at his discretion, reject a maximumof three sets of the test results so long as the total number of test resultsused to determine the RA is greater than or equal to nine, but they mustreport all data including the rejected data.6.4.4 <T3>Calculations.</T3> Summarize the results on a data sheet. Calculatethe mean of the RM values. Calculate the arithmetic differences betweenthe RM and the CEMS output sets. Then calculate the mean of the difference,standard deviation, confidence coefficient, and CEMS RA, using Equations2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 2-5.7.0 Equations7.1 <T3>Arithmetic Mean.</T3> Calculate the arithmetic mean of the difference,d, of a data set as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 352A </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where n = number of data points<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 352B </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG>When the mean of the differences of pairs of data is calculated, be sureto correct the data for moisture, if applicable.7.2 <T3>Standard Deviation.</T3> Calculate the standard deviation, Sd, as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 352C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG>7.3 <T3>Confidence Coefficient.</T3> Calculate the 2.5 percent error confidencecoefficient (one-tailed), CC, as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 352D </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where t<T2>0.975</T2>=t-value</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,i1,3,6,3,6,3,6</C><T4>Table 7-1._Values</T4><H1>n</H1>a <H1>t</H1><T2>0.975</T2> <H1>n</H1>a <H1>t</H1><T2>0.975</T2> <H1>n</H1>a <H1>t</H1><T2>0.975</T2> <ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>12.706</D><D>7</D><D>2.447</D><D>12</D><D>2.201</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>4.303</D><D>8</D><D>2.365</D><D>13</D><D>2.179</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>3.182</D><D>9</D><D>2.306</D><D>14</D><D>2.160</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>2.776</D><D>10</D><D>2.262</D><D>15</D><D>2.145</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>2.571</D><D>11</D><D>2.228</D><D>16</D><D>2.131</D><F/>a The values in this table are already corrected for n-1 degreesof freedom.

Repeat the entire performance specification test every second year.10.0 Reporting of Total Hydrocarbon LevelsTHC levels from the trial burn will be reported as ppm propane. Under thehealth-based alternative approach to assess THC emissions, the THC levelswould need to be converted to mg/s. This conversion is accomplished withthe following equation:<ITAG tagnum="26">THC, mg/s=(THC ppm propane)andmultiply;(Stack gas Flow)andmultiply;2.8andmultiply;10^2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andbullet; THC ppm propane is the total hydrocarbon concentration asactually measured by this method in ppm of propane,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andbullet; Stack gas flow is in dry standard cubic meters per minutemeasured by EPA Reference Method 5 (or Modified EPA Method 5) during theDRE trial burn, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andbullet; 2.8andmultiply;10^2 is a constant to account for the conversionof units, differences in FID response to various compounds and weightedaverage molecular weights.</ITAG>11.0 References11.1 Measurement of Volatile Organic Compounds_Guideline Series.

Technical Support for Tier I-III Metals and HCL Controlsand THC Emissions Rate Screening Limits</ITAG>This appendix summarizes the risk assessment approach the Agency used todevelop the proposed Tier I and II Screening Limits for metals and HCl,and the emission rate Screening Limits for total hydrocarbons (THC) thatwould be used to assess THC emissions under the health-based Tier II alternativefor PIC controls. In addition, the appendix summarizes how the metals andHCl controls would be implemented.I. Overview of EPA's Risk AssessmentThe risk assessment methodology is discussed in detail in the backgrounddocument supporting the amendments EPA plans to propose shortly for hazardouswaste incinerators_Technical Background Document: Controls for Metals andHydrogen Chloride Emissions for Hazardous Waste Incinerators. As explainedin the text of today's notice, the emissions standards, technical support,and risk assessment methodology for the boiler/furnace rules are identicalto those the Agency plans to propose for incinerators. The methodologyis summarized below for the convenience of the reader.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Overview of the Risk Assessment Approach</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment approach involves: (1) Establishing ambient levelsof pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrogen chloride (HCl), and total hydrocarbons(THC)) that pose acceptable health risk; and (2) developing conservativedispersion coefficients \40\<NOTE/> for reasonable worst-case facilities as a function of keyparameters (i.e., effective stack height,\41\<NOTE/> terrain type, and land use classification). To establishthe conservative Screening Limits for metals, HCl, and THC, we back-calculatedfrom the acceptable ambient levels using the conservative dispersion coefficients.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ For purposes of this document, the term dispersion coefficientrefers to the ambient concentration that would result from an emissionrate of 1 gram/sec.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Effective stack height is the height above ground levelof a plume, based on summing the physical stack height plus plume rise.Under today's proposal, applicants would be required to demonstrate thatemissions of metals, HCl, and (when stack gas CO concentrations exceed100 ppmv and under the health-based alternative approach to assess THCemissions) THC emissions do not result in an exceedance of the acceptableambient levels. If the conservative Screening Limits are not exceeded,applicants need not conduct site-specific dispersion modeling to make thisdemonstration.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Development of Conservative Dispersion Coefficients</ITAG>1. <T3>Factors Influencing Ambient Levels of Pollutants.</T3> Ambient levelsof pollutants resulting from stack emissions are a function of the dispersionof pollutants from the source in question. Many factors influence the relationshipsbetween releases (emissions) and ground-level concentrations, including:(1) The rate of emission; (2) the release specifications of the facility(i.e., stack height, exit velocity, exhaust temperature and inner stackdiameter, which together define the facility's ``effective stack height'');(3) local terrain; and (4) local meteorology and (5) urban/rural classification.2. <T3>Selection of Facilities and Sites for Dispersion Modeling.</T3>\42\<NOTE/> Hazardous waste incinerators are known to vary widely incapacity, configuration, and design, making it difficult to identify typicalparameters that affect dispersion of emissions (i.e., release parameters).For instance, stack heights of incinerators listed in the 1981 mail survey\43\<NOTE/> vary from less than 15 feet to over 200 feet. Futhermore,many new facilities that are now in operation that are not listed on thesurvey, and EPA expects that a large number of additional facilities ofvarious types of designs are likely to be constructed over the next severalyears.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ A survey of hazardous waste incinerators was used toidentify the range of release parameters_stact height, plume rise_representativeof the universe of incinerators. These release parameters were used todevelop the conservative dispersion coefficients that were used to developthe Screening Limits. Given that the range of incinerator release parameterswill also represent the range of release parameters for boilers and industrialfurnaces, the Screening Limits will also be appropriated for boilers andfurnaces (U.S. EPA, Draft Technical Background Document for Control ofMetals and HCl Emissions from Hazardous Waste Incinerators, August 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ DPRA, op. cit.For currently operating facilities, the worst-case dispersion situationwould be a combination of release specifications, local terrain, urban/ruralland use classification, and local meteorology that produces the highestambient concentrations of hazardous pollutants per unit of pollutant releasedby a facility. This can be expressed, for any specific facility, as a dispersioncoefficient, which, for purposes of this proposal, is the maximum annualaverage (or, as explained later, for HCl, maximum 3-minute) ground-levelconcentration for an emission of 1 g/s (a unit release); the units of thedispersion coefficient are, therefore, andCx.18;g/m3/g/s.\44\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Dispersion coefficients can be defined for any specificlocation surrounding a release. The maximum dispersion coefficient will,under the assumptions used in this regulation, be the dispersion coefficientfor the MEI. It may occur at any distance and in any direction from thefacility. However, locations within the property boundary of a facilitywould not be considered when implementing these proposed rules unless individualsreside on site.Since dispersion coefficients are, as a general rule, inversely correlatedwith effective stack heights, worst-case facilities are most likely tobe those with the shortest effective stack heights. No similar <T3>a priori</T3> judgment, however, should be made with respect to terrainor meteorology; evaluation of the influence of these factors requires individualsite-by-site dispersion modeling. It was therefore not possible to screenfacility locations in advance to select for probable worst-case situationssimply by considering stack height.Instead, out of a total number of 154 existing facilities for which datawere available from the 1981 mail survey,\45\<NOTE/> we roughly sorted the facilities into three terrain typesbased on broad-scale topographic maps: flat, rolling, and complex terrain.We then ranked the facilities by effective stack heights. Next, we evaluatedterrain rise out to 50 km for each of the 24 facilities and ranked thefacilities by maximum terrain rise. Finally, we subdivided the 24 facilitiesinto three groups which are loosely defined as flat, rolling, and complexterrain. In addition, to enable us to determine conservative dispersioncoefficients as a function of effective height, we developed 11 hypotheticalincinerators and modeled each of these ``incinerators'' at the 24 sites.The hypothetical facilities were selected by dividing the range of facilitieslisted in the 1981 survey into 10 categories based on effective stack height.Then, within each stack height category, we selected a hypothetical effectivestack height that approximated the 25th percentile of the range of heightsthat existed within the category. The 25th percentile was chosen in orderto select a facility likely to reflect the higher end of dispersion coefficients(and ambient levels) in each height category. In addition, an eleventhhypothetical source was defined in order to represent facilities whoseheights of release do not meet good engineering practice (see the discussionon good engineering practice in Section II of this appendix). Such deviceswill experience ``building wake effects''_turbulence created by adjacentstructures that immediately mixes the plume resulting in high ground levelconcentrations close to the stack.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ We note that the survey should be representative becauseit addressed over 50 percent of the 250 hazardous waste incinerators nowin operation.Finally, we also included the site that resulted in the worst-case complexterrain conditions during development of the rule for boilers and industrialfurnaces in 1987.\46\<NOTE/> Although there is currently no hazardous waste incineratorat that site, we used the site as another theoretical location for the11 hypothetical incinerators and merged the results into those from theactual incinerator sites. Under certain conditions, this site providedhigher dispersion coefficients for some stacks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ See ``Background Information Document for the Developmentof Regulations to Control the Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers andIndustrial Furnaces, Volume III: Risk Assessment, Engineering-Sciences'',February 1987. (Available from the National Technical Information Service,Springfield, VA, Order No. PB 87 173845.)In summary, 11 hypothetical incinerators and the actual incinerators weremodeled at each of 24 sites evenly distributed among flat, rolling, andcomplex terrain. In addition, the 11 hypothetical incinerators were modeledat an additional complex terrain site.3. <T3>Development of Dispersion Coefficients.</T3> Estimating the air impactsof the facilities required the use of five separate air dispersion models.We used the ``<T3>EPA Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),</T3>'' \47\<NOTE/> and consulted with the EPA Office of Air Quality Planningand Standards to select the most appropriate model for each application.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ USEPA.``<T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised).</T3>'' U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, ResearchTriangle Park, N.C. EPA-450/2/78-027R. July 1986.For each of the 25 locations, five consecutive years of concurrent surfaceand twice-per-day upper air data (to characterize mixing height) were acquired.The data sets contained hourly records of surface observations for fiveyears, or approximately 44,000 consecutive hours of meteorological data.The same five-year data set was used to estimate the highest hourly dispersioncoefficient during the five-year period, and to estimate annual averageconcentrations based on a five year data set for all release specificationsmodeled at each location.The actual incinerator release specifications at each location were usedto select the appropriate model for short-term and long-term averagingperiods. Once selected, the release specifications for the actual incineratorand the 11 hypothetical incinerators were modeled. Table F-1 lists themodels selected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,s25,r25,r25,r25</C><T4>Table F-1._Models Selected for the Risk Analysis</T4><H1>Terrain classification</H1><H1>Urban/rural</H1><H1>Averaging period</H1><H1>Model selected</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Flat or Rolling<D>Urban or Rural</D><D>Annual average</D><D>ISCLT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flat or Rolling<D>Urban or Rural</D><D>Hourly</D><D>ISCST.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complex<D>Urban</D><D>Annual average</D><D>LONGZ.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complex<D>Urban</D><D>Hourly</D><D>SHORTZ.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complex<D>Rural</D><D>Hourly or annual</D><D>COMPLEX I.</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Industrial Source Complex models (ISCLT and ISCST) were selected forflat and rolling terrain because they can address building downwash orelevated releases and can account for terrain differences between sourcesand receptors. The long-term mode (ISCLT) was used for annual averages,while the short-term mode (ISCST) was used to estimate maximum hourly concentrations.To meet the EPA guidance on model selection, we used three different modelsto characterize dispersion over complex terrain. For urban applications,OAQPS recommends SHORTZ for short-term averaging periods and LONGZ forseasonal or annual averages. For rural sites located in complex terrain,OAQPS recommends the COMPLEX I model.We used U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic maps to documentterrain rise out to 5 km from each stack. For purposes of this proposedrule, a facility is considered to be in flat terrain if the maximum terrainrise within 5 km of the stack is not greater than 10 percent of the physicalstack height. The facility is in rolling terrain if terrain rise is greaterthan 10 percent but not greater than the physical stack height, and incomplex terrain if terrain rise is greater than the physical stack height.\48\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ We note that EPA can consider terrain well past 5 kmof a stack to define terrain type for some facilities. We believe, however,that a radius of 5 km is adequate because we are concerned with MEI exposures(as opposed to aggregate population exposures) and because the effectivestack heights of concern are relatively low in comparison to facilitiessuch as major power plants. Thus, MEI exposures for the conditions modeledwill always occur within 5 km of the stack.We also used the topographic maps as the basis to classify land use asurban or rural. A simplified version of the Auer technique \49\<NOTE/> based on the preferred land use approach (rather than populationdensity) was used for this classification. If greater than 50 percent ofthe land was classified as urban, the models were executed in the urbanmode for that facility. If greater than 50 percent was classified as rural,the rural modes were used.\50\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Auer, August, H., Jr. ''<T3>Correlation of Land Use and Cover with Meteorological Anomalies. Journalof Applied Meteorology</T3>''; Vol. 17, pp. 636-643, May 1978.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ OAQPS guidelines indicate that 50 percent is the cutoffpoint between urban and rural; however, to be conservative and to accountfor differences in the accuracy of different measurement methods, EPA isrecommending that for permitting purposes land use be considered urbanif greater than 75 percent is urban; that it be considered rural if landuse is greater than 75 percent rural; and that if the land use is between75 percent urban and 75 percent rural the more conservative Screening Limitof the two be used.To identify conservative dispersion coefficients as a function of effectivestack height, we graphically plotted for each terrain type (i.e., flat,rolling, and complex) and each land use classification (i.e., urban andrural) dispersion coefficients for the modeled facilities and locationsas a function of effective stack height. The outer envelope representingthe highest dispersion coefficients was drawn to enable us to identifyconservative coefficients for any effective stack height within the rangeof those modeled (i.e., 4 m to 120 m).We determined that there was no significant difference in dispersion coefficients(under the severe conditions modeled) betwen flat and rolling terrain.Thus, those terrain types were merged together and termed noncomplex terrain.In addition, a discontinuity was observed between the SHORTZ/LONGZ andComplex I \51\<NOTE/> models, which resulted in our not distinguishing betweenland use classifications in complex terrain. Finally, we note that therewas no significant difference in 3-minute exposures between urban and ruralland used in either noncomplex or complex terrain. Thus, we have not distinguishedbetween land use classifications in establishing the HCl Screening Limits.There is, however, a significant difference in maximum annual average dispersioncoefficients between urban and rural land use in noncomplex terrain, andso we have established separate metals and THC Screening Limits for thosesituations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Complex I was found to produce relatively low estimatesof short-term concentrations.We note that the dispersion coefficients used to establish the ScreeningLimits are designed to be conservative, but may, in fact, not be conservativein extremely poor dispersion conditions, or when the receptor (location(i.e., residence)) is close-in to the source. Under the situations identifiedbelow, the Screening Limits may not be protective and the permit writershould require site-specific dispersion modeling consistent with EPA's<T3>``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)''</T3> to demonstrate thatemissions do not pose unacceptable health risk:andbullet; Facility is located in a narrow valley less than 1 km wide; orandbullet; Facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located such thatthe terrain rises to the stack height within 1 km of the facility; orandbullet; Facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located within 5km of the shoreline of a large body of water (such as an ocean or largelake); orandbullet; The facility property line is within 200 m of the stack and thephysical stack height is less than 10 m; orandbullet; Onsite receptors are of concern, and the stack height is lessthan 10 m.In addition to the situations identified above, there is a probability,albeit small, that the combination of critical parameters, stack height,stack gas velocity, effluent temperature, meteorological conditions, etc.,will result in higher ambient concentrations than resulted from the conservativemodeling done to support this rule. As a result, the Agency is reservingthe right to require that the owner or operator submit, as part of thepermit proceeding, an air quality dispersion analysis consistent with EPA's<T3>``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)''</T3> in order to ensurethat acceptable ambient levels of pollutants are not exceeded irrespectiveof whether the facility meets the specific Screening Limits that wouldbe established by this regulation.Finally, we specifically request comment on whether less conservative assumptions,coupled with a safety factor then applied to assure that ambient levelsare not underestimated, should be used to develop the Screening Limits.This alternative approach may have merit because the repeated use of conservativeassumptions in an analysis may ``multiply'' the conservatism unreasonably.Comments are solicited on: (1) The extent to which less conservative assumptionswould enable applicants to meet the Limits and, thus, how to reduce theconservatism of the Screening Limits while still ensuring that they areprotective; and (3) how the reduced conservatism would affect the criteriadiscussed above that must be considered to determine if the Screening Limitsare protective for a particular situation.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Evaluation of Health Risk</ITAG>1. <T3>Risk from Carcinogens.</T3> EPA cancer risk policy suggests that anylevel of human exposure to a carcinogenic substance entails some finitelevel of risk. Determining the risk associated with a particular dose requiresknowing the slope of the modeled dose-response curve. On this basis, EPA'sCarcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) has estimated carcinogenic slope factorsfor humans exposed to known and suspected human carcinogens. Slope factorsare estimated by a modeling process. The slope of the dose-response curveenables estimation of a unit risk. The unit risk is defined as the incrementallifetime risk estimated to result from exposure of an individual for a70-year lifetime to a carcinogen in air containing 1 microgram of the compoundper cubic meter of air. Both the slope factors and unit risks are reviewedby the Agency's Cancer Risk Assessment Validation Endeavor (CRAVE) workgroupfor verification.In setting acceptable risk levels to develop today's proposed rule, weconsidered the fact that not all carcinogens are equally likely to causehuman cancers, as discussed in <T3>``Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment''</T3> (51 FR 33992 (September24, 1986)). The Guidelines have established a weight-of-evidence schemereflecting the likelihood that a compound causes tumors in humans. Theweight-of-evidence scheme categorizes carcinogens according to the quantityand quality of both human and animal data as known, probable, and possiblehuman carcinogens. The proposed approach places a higher weight on cancerunit risk estimates that are based on stronger evidence of carcinogenicity.The proposed approach will provide for making fuller use of informationby explicitly examining risk for different categories of carcinogens. Inreaching the conclusion of the level of cancer risks to be used to supportthis proposal, we have considered available information on the constituentsbeing emitted, the evidence associating these compounds with cancer risk,the quantities of emissions of these constituents, and the exposed populations.For purposes of today's notice, we are proposing the following risk levelsas acceptable incremental lifetime cancer risk levels to the hypotheticalmaximum exposed individual (MEI): (1) for Group A and B carcinogens, onthe order of 10^6; 52 and<NOTE/> (2) for Group C carcinogens, on the order of 10^5. Theserisk levels are within the range of levels historically used by EPA inits hazardous waste and emergency response programs_10^4 to 10^7.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>52 A dose is calculated to correspond to a risk of causingcancer to one individual in one million exposed to that dose over a lifetime.Under the weight-of-evidence approach to assess carcinogenic risk for thisproposed rule, we believe it is appropriate to add the risk from carcinogens<T3>within</T3> the category of those that are known or probable humancarcinogens, the Group A and B carcinogens. Such a group is composed ofcertain metals which cause lung cancer (arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, andchromium).Similarly, it is appropriate to add the risk from carcinogens within thecategory of those that are probable or possible human carcinogens, C carcinogens.To implement this carcinogenic risk assessment approach, we are proposingto limit the aggregate risk to the MEI to 10^5. Given that the carcinogenicmetals that would be regulated in today's proposed rule are all Group Aor B carcinogens, this approach would effectively limit the risk from individualcarcinogenic metals to levels on the order of 10^6 but below 10^5. We consideredlimiting the aggregate risk to the MEI to 10^6 but determined that it wouldresult in setting risk levels for individual carcinogens to levels on theorder of 10^7, which has been judged (for purposes of this rule) to beunnecessarily conservative, considering the relatively low projected cancerincidence and relatively high cost per cancer reduced. Even though thecancer incidence is low, we do not consider a 10^4 risk level acceptablebecause: (1) The total annualized cost of the rule at a 10^5 aggregaterisk level is not substantial; thus, the cost of the added margin of safetyis reasonable; (2) indirect exposure has not yet been considered; and (3)toxic compounds not yet identified are not being controlled directly inthis rulemaking. We believe that an aggregate MEI risk of 10^5 is appropriatebecause: (1) It provides adequate protection of public health; (2) it considersweight of evidence of human carcinogenicity; (3) it limits the risk fromindividual Group A and B carcinogens to risk levels on the order of 10^6;and (4) it is within the range of risk levels the Agency has used for hazardouswaste regulatory programs.The Agency would like to use the weight-of-evidence approach in developingthe health-based alternative approach to assessing THC emissions underthe Tier II PIC controls. However, there a number of unidentified compoundsin the mix of hydrocarbon emissions. These unidentified compounds couldbe either carcinogens or noncarcinogens, or both. Of the compounds thatmay be carcinogens, the Agency does not know whether they would be classifiedas A, B1, B2, or C carcinogens. Since the Agency cannot classify theseunknown carcinogens, the Agency is unable to use a weight-of-evidence approachto select an acceptable risk level for THC. In order to be conservative,the Agency is assuming that THC can be treated as a single compound forwhich a unit cancer risk is calculated. To derive this unit cancer riskvalue, the historical data base of THC emissions from hazardous waste incinerators,boilers, and industrial furnaces was used. For each organic compound identifiedin the emissions, the 95th percentile highest concentration value was takenas a reasonable worst-case value. (The highest concentration was oftenused because there were too few data to identify the 95th percentile value.)For organic compounds listed in Appendix VIII of Part 261 for which healtheffects data are adequate to establish an RSD or RAC, but which have notbeen detected in emissions from hazardous waste combustion, an arbitraryemission concentration of 0.1 ng/L was assumed. The data base was furtheradjusted to increase the conservatism of the calculated THC unit risk valueby assuming that the carcinogen formaldehyde is emitted from hazardouswaste combustion devices at the 95th percentile levels found to be emittedfrom municipal waste combustors. The proportion of the emission concentrationof each compound to the total emission concentration for all compoundswas then determined. This proportion, termed a proportional emission concentration,was them multiplied by the unit cancer risk developed by CAG to obtaina risk level for that compound. A unit risk of zero was used for noncarcinogenslike methane. All the cancer risks were added together to derive a weightedaverage 95th percentile unit risk value for THC. This procedure for developinga THC unit risk value assumes that the proportion of the various hydrocarbonsis the same for all incinerators, boilers and industrial furnaces burninghazardous waste. In addition, it weighs all carcinogens the same regardlessof current EPA classification.As explained in the text, we are proposing to limit hydrocarbon emissions_whenstack gas carbon monoxide levels exceed 100 ppmv and under the health-basedalternative_based on a 10^5 aggregate risk level. Thus, we are limitingeach of the constituents to a risk level on the order of 10^6.Finally, in assessing the risk from facilities that emit both THC and carcinogenicmetals, we are not proposing that the risk from THC emissions be addedto the aggregate MEI risk from metals emissions. Adding the risk wouldbe inappropriate because we do not know how all the THC would be classifiedaccording to weight of evidence. (We note again that we prefer the technology-basedapproach to assess THC emissions for reasons discussed in the text.)We specifically request comment on this proposed approach to assess carcinogenicrisk. We also welcome suggestions or alternative ways to account for additivity.The Agency also requests comment on whether aggregate population risk orcancer incidence (i.e., cancer cases per year) should also be consideredin developing the national emission limits and in site-specific risk assessments.This approach could, in some situations, be more conservative than consideringonly MEI risk because, even if the ``acceptable'' MEI risk level were notexceeded, large population centers may be exposed to emissions such thatthe increase in cancer cases could be significant. However, it would bedifficult to develop acceptable aggregate cancer incidence rates. Nevertheless,it is likely that many facilities that perform a site-specific MEI exposureand risk analysis would also generate an aggregate population exposureand risk analysis that could be considered by the Agency. Based on publiccomment and further thought on how to implement this dual approach, thefinal rule could incorporate consideration of both the MEI and aggregatepopulation risk. Alternatively, EPA could provide guidance to the permitwriter on when and how to consider cancer incidence on a case-by-case basisunder authority of section 3005(c)(3) of HSWA, as codified at andSection;270.32(b)(2).2. <T3>Risk from Noncarcinogens.</T3> For toxic substances not known to displaycarcinogenic properties, there appears to be an identifiable exposure thresholdbelow which adverse health effects usually do not occur. Noncarcinogeniceffects are manifested when these pollutants are present in concentrationsgreat enough to overcome the homeostatic, compensating, and adaptive mechanismsof the organism. Thus, protection against the adverse health effects ofa toxicant is likely to be achieved by preventing total exposure levelsfrom exceeding the threshold dose. Since other sources in addition to thecontrolled source may contribute to exposure, ambient concentrations associatedwith the controlled source should ideally take other potential sourcesinto account. The Agency has therefore conservatively defined referenceair concentrations (RACs) for noncarcinogenic compounds that are definedin terms of a fixed fraction of the estimated threshold concentration.The RACs for lead and hydrogen chloride, however, were established differently,as discussed below. The RACs are presented in Appendix H to this notice.RACs have been derived from oral reference doses (RfDs) for those noncarcinogeniccompounds listed in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 (except for lead andhydrogen chloride) for which the Agency considers that it has adequatehealth effects data. An oral RfD is an estimate (with an uncertainty ofperhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily exposure (via ingestion) forthe human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely tobe without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects even if exposureoccurs daily for a lifetime. Since these oral-based RACs are subject tochange, EPA contemplates publishing <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices if the RACs change in a way that affectsthe regulatory standard (see also the discussion of this issue in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on boilers and furnaces published today).The Agency is proposing RACs derived from oral RfDs because it believesthat the development of the RfDs has been technically sound and adequatelyreviewed. Specifically:1. EPA has developed verified RfDs and is committed to establishing RfDsfor all constituents of Agency interest. The verification process is conductedby an EPA workgroup, and the conclusions and reasons for these decisionsare publicly available.2. The verification process ensures that the critical study is of appropriatelength and quality to derive a health limit for long-term, lifetime protection.3. RfDs are based on the best available information meeting minimum scientificcriteria. Information may come from experimental animal studies or fromhuman studies.4. RfDs are designed to give long-term protection for even the most sensitivemembers of the population, such as pregnant women, children, and oldermen and women.5. RfDs are designated by the Agency as being of high, medium, or low confidencedepending on the quality of the information on which they are based andthe amount of supporting data. The criteria for the confidence rating arediscussed in the RfD decision documents.The Agency used the follwing strategy to derive the inhalation exposurelimits proposed today:1. Where a verified oral RfD has been based on an inhalation study, wewill calculate the inhalation exposure limit directly from the study.2. Where a verified oral RfD has been based on an oral study, we will usea conversion factor of 1 for route-to-route extrapolation in driving aninhalation limit.3. Where appropriate EPA health documents exist, such as the Health EffectsAssessments (HEAs) and the Health Effects and Environmental Profiles (HEEPs),containing relevant inhalation toxicity data, their data will be used inderiving inhalation exposure limits. We will also consider other agencyhealth documents (such as NIOSH's criteria documents).4. If RfDs or other toxicity data from agency health documents are notavailable, then we will consider other sources of toxicity information.Calculations will be made in accordance with the RfD methodology.The Agency recognizes the limitations of route-to-route conversions usedto derive the RACs and is in the process of examining confounding factorsaffecting the conversion, such as: (a) The appropriateness of extrapolatingwhen a portal of entry is the critical target organ; (b) first pass effects;and (c) effect of route on dosimetry.The Agency, through its Inhalation RfD Workgroup, is developing referencedose values for inhalation exposure, and additional values are expectedto be available this year. The Agency will use the available inhalationRfDs_after providing appropriate opportunity for public comment_when thisrule is promulgated. Certainly, if the workgroup develops inhalation referencedoses prior to promulgation of today's rule that are substantially differentfrom the RACs proposed today, and if the revised inhalation reference dosecould be expected to have a significant adverse impact on the regulatedcommunity, the Agency will take public comment on the revised RACs afternotice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.EPA proposed this same approach for deriving RACs on May 6, 1987 (52 FR16993) for boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. Wereceived a number of comments on the proposed approach of deriving referenceair concentrations (RACs) from oral RfDs. As stated in today's proposaland the May 6, 1987, proposal, we would prefer to use inhalation referencedoses. Some comments suggested other means of deriving RACs. We will considerthose comments and others that may be submitted as a result of today'snotice in developing the final rule.As previously stated, EPA has derived the RACs from oral reference doses(RfDs) for the compounds of concern. An oral RfD is an estimate of a dailyexposure (via ingestion) for the human population that is likely to bewithout an appreciable risk of deleterious effects, even if exposure occursdaily throughout a lifetime.\53\<NOTE/> The RfD for a specific chemical is calculated by dividingthe experimentally determined no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)or lowest-observable-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) by the appropriate uncertaintyfactor(s). The RAC values inherently take into account sensitive populations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Current scientific understanding, however, does not considerthis demarcation to be rigid. For brief periods and for small excursionsabove the RfD, adverse effects are unlikely in most of the population.On the other hand, several circumstances can be cited in which particularlysensitive members of the population suffer adverse responses at levelswell below the RfD. See 51 FR 1627 (January 14, 1986).The Agency is proposing to use the following equation to convert oral RfDsto RACs:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,s10,r300</C> <H1>RAC (mg/m</H1>3) = <H1>RfD (mg/kg-bw/day) andmultiply; body weight andmultiply; correction factorandmultiply; background level factor</H1><H2>m</H2>3 air breathed/day <ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where:andbullet; RfD is the oral reference doseandbullet; Body weight (bw) is assumed to be 70 kg for an adult maleandbullet; Volume of air breathed by an adult male is assumed to be 20 m3per dayandbullet; Correction factor for route-to-route extrapolation (going fromthe oral route to the inhalation route) is 1.0andbullet; Background level factor is 0.25. It is a factor to fraction theRfD to the intake resulting from direct inhalation of the compound emittedfrom the source (i.e., an individual is assumed to be exposed to 75 percentof the RfD from the combination of indirect exposure from the source inquestion and other sources).a. <T3>Short-Term Exposures.</T3> In today's proposed rule, the RACs are usedto determine if adverse health effects are likely to result from exposureto stack emissions by comparing maximum annual average ground-level concentrationsof a pollutant to the pollutant's RAC. If the RAC is not exceeded, EPAdoes not anticipate adverse health effects. The Agency, however, is alsoconcerned about the impacts of short-term (less than 24-hour) exposures.The ground-level concentration of an emitted pollutant can be an orderof magnitude greater during a 3-minute or 15-minute period of exposurethan the maximum annual average exposure. This is because meteorologicalfactors vary over the course of a year resulting in a wide distributionof exposures. Thus, maximum annual average concentrations are always muchlower than short-term exposure concentrations. On the other hand, the short-termexposure RAC is also generally much higher than the lifetime exposure RAC.Nonetheless, in some cases short-term exposure may pose a greater healththreat than annual exposure. Unfortunately, the use of RfDs limits thedevelopment of short-term acute exposure limits because no acceptable methodologyexists for the derivation of less than lifetime exposure from the RfDs.\54\<NOTE/> However, despite these limitations, the Agency is proposinga short-term (i.e., 3-minute) RAC for HCl of 150 mg/m3, based on limiteddata documenting a no-observed-effect-level in animals exposed to HCl viainhalation.\55\<NOTE/> We do anticipate, however, that short-term RACs for othercompounds will be developed by the Agency in the future.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Memo from Clara Chow through Reva Rubenstein, Characterizationand Assessment Division, EPA, to Robert Holloway, Waste Management Division,EPA, entitled ``Use of RfDs Versus TLVs for Health Criteria,'' January13, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Memo from Characterization and Assessment Division toWaste Management Division, October 2, 1986, interpreting results from Sellakumar,A.R.; Snyder, C.A.; Solomon, J.J.; Albert, R.E.

In addition, the Agency has recently determinedthat lead is a probable human carcinogen even though a unit risk valuehas not yet been developed. Although the lead NAAQS is 1.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\,sources could contribute only up to 0.15 andCx.18;g/m\3\ for purposes ofthis regulation. Given, however, that the lead NAAQS is based on a quarterlyaverage, the equivalent annual exposure is 0.09 andCx.18;g/m3 for a quarterlyaverage of 0.15 andCx.18;g/m\3\. Thus, the lead RAC is 0.09 andCx.18;g/m\3\.This is the same level EPA proposed in the 1987 boiler and furnace proposedrule. See 52 FR 17006.d. <T3>Relationship to NAAQS. </T3>The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA toestablish ambient standards for pollutants determined to be injurious topublic health or welfare. Primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards(NAAWS) must reflect the level of attainment necessary to protect publichealth allowing for an adequate margin of safety. Secondary NNAQS mustbe designed to protect public welfare in addition to public health, and,thus, are more stringent.As discussed above, the Reference Air Concentration (RAC) proposed todayfor Lead is based on the Lead NAAQS. As the Agency develops additionalNAAQS for toxic compounds that may be emitted from hazardous waste incinerators,boilers, and industrial furnaces, we will consider whether the acceptableambient levels (and, subsequently, the feed rate and emission rate ScreeningLimits) ultimately established under this rule should be revised.The reference air concentration values (and risk-specific dose values forcarcinogens) proposed here in no way preclude the Agency from establishingNAAQS as appropriate for these compounds under authority of the CAA.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Risk Assessment Assumptions</ITAG>We have used a number of assumptions in the risk assessment, some conservativeand others nonconservative, to simplify the analysis or to address issueswhere definitive data do not exist.Conservative assumptions include the following:andbullet; Individuals reside at the point of maximum annual average and(for HCl) maximum short-term ground-level concentrations. Furthermore,risk estimates for carcinogens assume that the maximum exposed individualresides at the point of maximum annual average concentration for a 70-yearlifetime.andbullet; Indoor air contains the same levels of pollutants contributedby the source as outdoor air.andbullet; For noncarcinogenic health determinations, background exposurealready amounts to 75 percent of the RfD. This includes other routes ofexposure, including ingestion and dermal. Thus, the incinerator is onlyallowed to contribute 25 percent of the RfD via direct inhalation. Theonly exception is for lead, where the source is allowed to contribute only10 percent of the NAAQS. This is because ambient lead levels in urban areasalready represent a substantial portion (e.g., one-third or more) of thelead NAAQS. In addition, the Agency is particularly concerned about healthrisks from lead in light of health effects data available since the leadNAAQS was established. EPA is currently reviewing the lead NAAQS to determineif it should be lowered.\5\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ At this point, we have not attempted to quantify indirectexposure through the food chain, ingestion of water contaminated by deposition,and dermal exposure, because as yet no acceptable methodology for doingso has been developed and approved by the Agency for use for evaluatingcombustion sources. We note, however, that by allowing the source to contributeonly 25 percent of the RfD (or 10 percent of the NAAQS in the case of lead)accounts for indirect exposure by assuming a person is exposed to 75 percentof the RfD from other sources and other exposure pathways. (EPA is developingsuch a methodology for application to waste combustion sources. The Agency'sScience Advisory Board has reviewed this methodology, and the Agency iscontinuing to refine the methodology. When the Agency completes developmentof procedures to evaluate indirect exposure, a more detailed analysis maybe applied to all devices burning hazardous wastes.)andbullet; Risks are considered for pollutants that are known, probable,and possible human carcinogens.andbullet; Individual health risk numbers have large uncertainty factorsimplicit in their derivation to take into effect the most sensitive portionof the population.Nonconservative assumptions include the following:andbullet; Although emissions are complex mixtures, interactive effects ofthreshold or carcinogenic compounds have not been considered in this regulationbecause data on such relationships are inadequate.\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ Additive effects of carcinogenic compounds are consideredby summing the risks for all carcinogens to estimate the aggregate riskto the most exposed individual (MEI).andbullet; Environmental effects (i.e., effects on plants and animals) havenot been considered because of a lack of adequate information. Adverseeffects on plants and animals may occur at levels lower than those thatcause adverse human health effects. (The Agency is also developing proceduresand requesting Science Advisory Board review to consider environmentaleffects resulting from emissions from all categories of waste combustionfacilities.)II. Implementation of the Metals and HCl Controls<ITAG tagnum="81">A.</ITAG>OverviewAs in the 1987 proposed rule, EPA is proposing to control metals and HClemissions by requiring a site-specific risk analysis when metals or HClemissions (or feed rates) exceed conservative Screening Limits. EPA developedthe Screening Limits to minimize the need for conducting site-specificrisk assessments, thereby reducing the burden to applicants and permitofficials. When the Screening Limits are exceeded, the applicant wouldbe required to conduct a site-specific risk assessment that demonstratesthat the potential exposure of the maximum exposed individual to metalsand HCl does not result in an exceedance of reasonable acceptable marginaladditional risks, namely:andbullet; That exposure to all carcinogenic metals be limited such thatthe sum of the excess risks attributable to ambient concentrations of thesemetals does not exceed an additional lifetime individual risk (to the (potential)maximum exposed individual) of 10^5; andandbullet; That exposure to each noncarcinogenic metal and HCl be limitedsuch that exposure (to the (potential) maximum exposed individual) doesnot exceed the reference air concentration (RAC) for the metal and HCl.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Meals and HCl Emissions Standards</ITAG>The metals and HCl emissions standards would require site-specific riskassessment to demonstrate that emissions will not: (1) Result in exceedancesof the reference air concentrations (RACs) for noncarcinogens at the potentialMEI; and (2) result in an aggregate increased lifetime cancer risk to thepotential MEI of greater than 1andmultiply;10^5. The RACs for noncarcinogensand risk specific doses (RSDs) for carcinogens are presented in appendixH to this notice.To reduce the burden on applicants and permitting officials, EPA has developedconservative Screening Limits for metals and HCl emissions (and feed rates)as a function of terrain adjusted effective stack height, terrain, andland use. See discussion below. If the Screening Limits are not exceeded,site-specific dispersion modeling would not be required to demonstrateconformance with the proposed standard.If the Screening Limits are exceeded, the applicant would be required toconduct site-specific dispersion modeling in conformance with ``Guidelineon Air Quality Models (Revised),'' July 1986, EPA Publication Number 450/2-78-027R(OAQPS Guideline No. 1.2-080), available from National Technical InformationService, Springfield, Virginia, Order No. PB 86-245286. We are proposingto incorporate that document by reference in the rule.The use of physical stack height in excess of Good Engineering Practice(GEP) stack height is prohibited in the development of emission limitationsunder EPA's Air Program at 40 CFR 51.12 and 40 CFR 51.18. We propose toadopt a similar policy by limiting the height of the physical stack forwhich credit will be allowed in complying with the metals (and other) standards(i.e., both site-specific dispersion modeling and Screening Limits). GEPidentifies the minimum stack height at which significant adverse aerodynamiceffects are avoided. Although higher than GEP stack heights are not prohibited,credit will not be allowed for stack heights greater than GEP. Good EngineeringPractice (GEP) maximum stack height means the greater of: (1) 65 meters,measured from the ground-level elevation at the base of the stack; or (2)Hg=H+1.5L.\60\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ We note that this equation also identifies the GEP minimumstack height necessary to avoid building wake effects. EPA recommends theapplication of GEP to define minimum stack heights to minimize potentiallyhigh concentration of pollutants in the immediate vicinity of the unit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where:<ITAG tagnum="26">Hg = GEP minimum stack height measured from the ground-level elevationat the base of the stack;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H = height of nearby structure(s) measured from the ground-level elevationat the base of the stack;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">L = lesser dimension, height or projected width, of nearby structure(s).</ITAG>If the result of the above equation is less than 65 meters, then the actualphysical stack height, up to 65 meters, could be used for compliance purposes.If the result of the equation is greater than 65 meters, the physical stackheight considered for compliance purposes cannot exceed that level.EPA requests comment on this use of GEP maximum stack height. We note thatalthough an owner or operator could increase his physical stack heightup to the GEP maximum to achieve better dispersion and a higher allowableemission rate, he should first consider that EPA plans to develop for subsequentproposal in 1991 a best demonstrated technology (BDT) particulate standardthat is likely to be much lower than the current 0.08 gr/dscf standard.Thus, it may be more cost-effective to upgrade emission control equipmentto state-of-the-art control rather than increase stack height.EPA specifically requests comments on how many facilities are likely toexceed the Screening Limits discussed below and, thus, would conduct site-specificdispersion modeling to comply with the proposed rule. Further, we requestinformation on the changes to equipment and operations that would be requiredto comply with the Screening Limits if the provision for site-specificdispersion modeling was not available.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. </ITAG><T3>Screening Limits</T3>EPA developed conservative Screening Limits for metals and HC1 emissionrates (and feed rates) to minimize the need for site-specific dispersionmodeling, and thus, reduce the burden on applicants and permitting officials.\61\<NOTE/> The Screening Limits are provided as a function of terrain-adjustedeffective stack height, terrain, and urban/rural classification as discussedbelow. The Screening Limits would be included in the ``Risk AssessmentGuideline for Permitting Hazardous Waste Thermal Treatment Services'' (RAG)which would be incorporated by reference in the rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ We note that the Screening Limits are designed to beconservative and would likely limit emissions by a factor of 2 to 20 timeslower than would be allowed by site-specific dispersion modeling.1. <T3>Emission Screening Limits</T3>. As discussed in Section I of this Appendix,EPA derived conservative emissions Screening Limits by back-calculatingfrom the reference air concentrations (RACs) and risk-specific doses (RSDs)using reasonable worst-case dispersion coefficients. The emission ScreeningLimits are presented in Tables E-5, E-6, E-7, and E-8, and E-10 in appendixE. Tables E-7 and E-8 apply to carcinogenic metals, and tables E-5 andE-6 apply to noncarcinogenic metals. Tables E-5 and E-7 apply to facilitieslocated in noncomplex terrain. Different emissions limits are providedfor urban versus rural land use because dispersion coefficients are significantlydifferent for the land use categories. Tables E-6 and E-8 show emissionlimits for facilities located in complex terrain. No distinction is madefor urban versus rural land use with complex terrain because of limitationsin the available modeling techniques. If multiple carcinogenic metals areto be burned, (i.e., As, Cd, Cr, Be) then the following equation wouldbe used to demonstrate that the aggregate risk to the MEI from all carcinogenicmetals does not exceed 10^5 (the ratios must be summed because the screeninglimit for each metal is back-calculated from the 10^5 RSD for that metal).<G/><ITAG tagnum="91"> insert illus, 395 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where:<ITAG tagnum="26">n = number of carcinogenic metals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Actual Emission Rate = the emission rate in g/s measured during thetrial burn or provided in lieu of the trial burn for metal ``i''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Emissions Screening Limit = Limit provided in Table E-7 or E-8 inAppendix E for metal ``i''</ITAG>To demonstrate compliance with Emissions Screening Limits, the owner oroperator would conduct emissions testing during the trial burn, as discussedbelow.2. <T3>Feed Rate Screening Limits</T3>. Feed rate Screening Limits are providedto enable applicants burning wastes with very low metals or chlorine concentrationsto avoid emissions testing. The feed rate limits are ``back-calculated''from the emissions Screening Limits assuming conservatively that all metalsand chlorine in the waste are emitted to the atmosphere. Thus, no metalsare assumed to partition to the bottom ash and no allowance is made forremoval of metal or HC1 emissions by air pollution control devices. Consequently,the feed rate limits are equivalent to the emission limits, but are presentedin units more consistent with waste feed rate, lb/hr, rather than g/s.The Feed Rate Screening Limits are shown in Tables E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4 andE-9 in appendix E. Tables E-3 and E-4 apply to carcinogenic metals andTables E-1 and E-2 apply to noncarcinogenic metals. Tables E-1 and E-3apply to facilities located in noncomplex terrain. As with the emissionsScreening Limits, different limits are provided for urban versus ruralland use because dispersion coefficients usually are significantly differentin urban and rural settings. Tables E-2, E-4, and E-9 show feed rate limitsfor facilities located in complex terrain. Again, no distinction is madefor urban versus rural land use within complex terrain. These feed ratesfor carcinogen metals show the maximum quantity of any single metal thatmay be burned at any one time, in the absence of all others.The feed rate limit for each carcinogenic metal ensures that ambient levelswill not exceed the risk-specific dose at an incremental lifetime risklevel of 1andmultiply;10^5. Similarly, the feed rates for the noncarcinogenicmetals and HC1 ensure that the reference air concentrations (RACs) willnot be exceeded. If the waste contains multiple carcinogenic metals, thenthe following equation would be used to ensure that aggregate risk to theMEI does not exceed 1 x 10^5. <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 396</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where:<ITAG tagnum="26">n = number of carcinogens</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Actual Feed Rate = the actual feed rate during the trial burn formetal ``i'' to be used in the permit </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Feed Rate Screening Limit = limit provided in Table E-3 or E-4 inAppendix E for metal ``i''</ITAG>3. <T3>Terrain-Adjusted Effective Stack Height</T3>. For purposes of complyingwith the Screening Limits, terrain-adjusted effective stack height is determinedby adding to the stack height the appropriate plume rise factor (whichis a function of temperature and stack flow rate \62\<NOTE/>) established in Table F-2 and by subtracting the maximumterrain rise within 5 km of the stack.\63\<NOTE/> Since terrain has, however, already been taken into accountin the dispersion modeling that supports the emission limits, this requirementeffective ``double counts'' terrain effects.

Note that increments in the categories are small when theterrain adjusted stack heights are low, and increase as the terrain adjustedstack height increases. This is because ambient concentrations are morestrongly affected by variations in this term when stack heights are lessthan 30 meters.The effective stack height is the height above the ground at which theplume becomes parallel to the ground after reaching equilibrium. Specifically,at the effective stack height the stack effluent has reached a final plumerise level and is assumed to remain at this height above the ground asit travels downwind. Therefore, the effective stack height is the physicalstack height plus the final plume rise.4. <T3>Terrain Designation.</T3> Terrain classifications are significant becausedispersion of air pollutants is affected by the relationship between themaximum height of the surrounding terrain (especially within a radius of1-2 km) and the effective height of the stack. EPA's analysis for thisregulation reviewed three classes of terrain: flat, rolling, and complex.Although results for flat and for rolling terrain were sufficiently similarthat these classes are combined for purposes of developing the ScreeningLimits (i.e., called noncomplex terrain), it will be necessary for applicantsto determine whether their facility lies in noncomplex or complex terrain.For purposes of applying the Screening Limits, a facility lies in noncomplexterrain if the maximum terrain rise within a radius of five kilometersof the stack is less than or equal to the physical stack height. If theterrain rise is greater than the physical stack height, the facility isin <T3>complex terrain.</T3>5. <T3>Land Use.</T3> Characterization of urban versus rural land use is significantbecause pollutants tend to disperse differently in these two settings_ruralareas tend to have a higher frequency of periods with limited dispersion.The ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'' specifies a procedureto determine the character of the modeling area as primarily urban or rural.In this procedure, two methods are presented: (1) The land use procedure,and (2) population density procedure. The land use procedure is the recommendedapproach.The land use procedure classifies land use within an area circumscribedby a 3 kilometer radius circle around a source. A typing scheme developedby August H. Auer, Jr. is referenced by the guideline as an aid in definingthe specific types of land use. A simplified adaption of this procedureis recommended for this rule and is described in Tab A and Appendix I ofthe ``Guidance on Metals and Hydrogen Chloride Controls for Hazardous WasteIncinerators''.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Conservation of Risk Methodology</ITAG>We specifically request comment on whether less conservative assumptions,coupled with a safety factor then applied to assure that ambient levelsare not underestimated, should be used to develop the Screening Limits.This alternative approach may have merit because the repeated use of conservativeassumptions in an analysis may ``multiply'' the conservatism unreasonably.Comments are solicited on: (1) The extent to which less conservative assumptionswould enable applicants to meet the Limits and, thus, (2) how to reducethe conservatism of the Screening Limits while still ensuring that theyare protective; and (3) how the reduced conservatism would affect the criteriadiscussed above that must be considered to determine if the Screening Limitsare protective for a particular situation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix G: Implementation of Metals and HCl Controls</ITAG>The metals emissions standards would be implemented by establishing limitsin the permit on the feed rate (lb/hr) of each metal. If the applicantelects to comply with the feed rate Screening Limits, the Screening Limitsfor the noncarcinogenic metals would become the permitted levels. For carcinogenicmetals, the permitted feed rate limits would be the feed rates the applicantuses to demonstrate that the sum of the ratios of actual feed rate to theScreening Limits for all carcinogenic metals does not exceed one.If the applicant elects to comply with the emissions Screening Limits orto conduct site-specific dispersion modeling to demonstrate that higheremissions rates do not pose unacceptable health risk, metals emissionswould be controlled in the permit by: (1) Limiting feed rates to thoseduring the trial burn when metals emissions were determined; (2) limitingemission rates to those during the trial burn; (3) specifying key operatingparameters that can affect metals emissions (e.g., maximum combustion chambertemperature, maximum chlorine content in the waste feed); and (4) specifyingoperating and maintenance requirements for the air pollution control deviceto ensure that collection efficiency does not degrade over time.The waste feed rate limits (lb/hr) specified in the permit would representmaximum limits that can never be exceeded. We considered whether limitsshould represent average values (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly,or even yearly averages). We believe that allowing (greater than hourly)averaging would complicate operator recordkeeping and EPA inspection andenforcement activities. EPA believes compliance with the standards canbe enforced by sampling of waste feed inputs to the incinerator. EPA requestscomment on whether and how alternate averaging periods should be allowedfor compliance with the metals (and HCl) standards. It could be arguedthat long-term averaging is appropriate because the proposed acceptableambient levels are based on long-term (annual) exposure. However, in selectingan averaging period, we must consider ease of enforcement and adverse healtheffects from short-term exposures to high ambient levels. One alternativeapproach would be to allow for the carcinogenic metals (i.e., arsenic,beryllium, cadmium, and chromium) and lead a 24-hour averaging period providedthat emissions at any point in time do not exceed ten times the permitlimit based on annual exposure. A ten-fold higher instantaneous ambientlevel for the carcinogenic metals may not pose adverse health effects giventhat the 24-hour average would not exceed the level that could pose a 10^5health risk over a lifetime of exposure and that threshold (i.e., noncancer)health effects would not be likely at exposures only ten times higher thanthe 10^5 risk-specific dose. A ten-fold higher instantaneous ambient levelfor lead may not pose adverse health effects given that the proposed acceptableambient level for long-term exposure to lead is based on only 10% of theNational Ambient Air Quality Standard. We do not believe that a similarapproach for the other noncarcinogenic metals would be appropriate giventhe uncertainty in the level of protection provided by the proposed long-termacceptable ambient levels (e.g., the ambient levels are based on oral RfDsconverted 1-to-1 to inhalation values). We specifically request commenton this and other approaches to implementing the feed rate limits.We also request comments on approaches other than waste analysis combinedwith feed rate limits to implement the controls on metals emissions. Otherapproaches that may be practicable include: (1) Determining the correlationbetween metals emissions and metals concentrations in emission controlresidues (e.g., scrubber water, bag house dust, ESP dust) during the trialburn followed by compliance monitoring of metals concentrations in theresidues (e.g., daily analyses; daily composite sampling with weekly analyses;or daily composite sampling with monthly analyses); (2) semicontinuousemission monitoring (e.g., 6 hours of every 24 hours of operation); and(3) ambient monitoring in conformance with procedures recommended by EPA'sOffice of Air Quality Planning and Standards.\64\<NOTE/> Based on public comment and additional analysis, the finalrule may provide one or more alternative approaches to waste analysis toimplement the controls.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\ Under the ambient monitoring approach, the Agency wouldconsider increasing the RACs for the noncarcinogenic metals because exposurefrom other sources would be accounted for. To consider indirect exposure,however, the RACs would still be based on a fraction of the RfD (e.g.,50% rather than the 25% proposed). Further, the Agency may not raise theRAC for lead under this approach given that we now believe that lead isa probable human carcinogen.EPA believes that the metal in a waste may partition differently accordingto the type and location of the feed system through which a metal-bearingwaste is fed. For example, the mass fraction of a metal in a solid wastefired onto the grate of a boiler and that subsequently enters the combustiongas stream and finally escapes the emissions control device and is emittedmay be different from the mass fraction of a metal in a liquid waste firedwith an atomization nozzel that is ultimately emitted to the atmosphere.Similarly, wastes fired to cement kiln systems may partition differentlydepending on whether the waste is fired in liquid or solid form, and onfiring location (e.g., hot end of the kiln, midkiln, precalciner). EPAanticipates, therefore, that separate feed rate limits may need to be setin the permit for each feed system. Consequently, permit applicants maywish to vary trial burn conditions to establish appropriate permit limitsfor metals fed through each separate feed system or location. EPA requestscomment on the need for and practicality of such permit conditions.EPA anticipates that boilers without air pollution control devices capableof capturing metals will choose to comply with the Feed Rate ScreeningLimits by controlling the levels of metals in the wastes and will blendhigher levels of metals that exist in specific wastes down to acceptableconcentrations depending upon the capacity of the boiler.For boilers and industrial furnaces equipped with air pollution controldevices, we anticipate that the operator will comply with the EmissionsScreening Limits. Compliance would be demonstrated by conducting an actualtrial burn which measures metals emissions. Such operators will attemptin some instances to increase operating flexibility in their permits byensuring that wastes of high metals contents are burned during trial burns.Spiking of metals in soluble forms may be advisable.

The added cost of the dispersion modeling maybe reasonable even if the boiler or furnace is equipped with high efficiencyemissions control equipment because the Screening Limits are likely tobe conservative by a factor of 2 to 20.Implementation for Multiple Sources On SiteThe preceding discussion of the Screening Limits and Site-Specific DispersionModeling presumed only one hazardous waste combustion source at each site.However, facilities may have more than one source on site burning hazardouswaste emitting from one or more stacks. EPA proposes that all such sources,whether incinerators, boilers, or industrial furnaces must meet the appropriatemetals (and hydrogen chloride and THC) limits that would be establishedby this rule if such combustion devices burn hazardous waste. EPA anticipatesthat the revised incinerator standards that it plans to propose shortlywould be copromulgated with the final rules for boilers and industrialfurnaces. Thus, the sum of all emissions of toxic metals (and HCl and THC)from on-site sources must be considered when complying with the metals(and HCl and THC) standards.EPA considered the method by which owners and operators could comply withthis modified bubble approach. The net effect is to limit the total amountof metal-bearing waste at any one site with the use of adequate air pollutioncontrol devices. Thus, it would be inappropriate for the Agency to regulatemetal emissions at an incinerator without taking into account the metalemissions generated by, for example, an on-site boiler burning hazardouswaste and emitting toxic metals through the same or a nearby stack.Owners and operators with multiple on-site sources could still demonstratecompliance with the Screening Limits by conservatively assuming all hazardouswaste is fed to the source with the worst-case (i.e., considering dispersion)stack. The worst-case stack would be determined from the following equationas applied to each stack:<ITAG tagnum="26">K=HVT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">K=a parameter accounting for relative influence of stack height andplume rise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H=Physical Stack height (meters).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">V=Flow rate (m\3\/second).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">T=Exhaust temperature (Kelvin)</ITAG>The stack with the lowest value of K is to be used as the worst-case stack.The use of this assumption can be very conservative if there are substantialdifferences in effective stack heights. We assume that most facilitieswith multiple sources and stacks would perform site-specific dispersionmodeling to determine the relative importance of each source or stack contributionto the ambient metal (and HCl and THC) levels.Short-Term Exposure Considerations for HClThe dispersion modeling used to develop the Screening Limits indicatedthat, for the severe (i.e., poor) dispersion scenarios considered, therisk from short-term exposure was invariably greater than for long-termexposure. Thus, short-term (i.e., 3-min) exposures were used to developthe Screening Limits.EPA proposed the 3-minute exposure RAC for HCl in the 1987 boiler/furnaceproposal. Several commenters had concerns with the use of a 3-minute HClRAC. Other commenters suggested alternative values for a short-term HClRAC. We will consider those comments and other that may be submitted asa result of today's notice in developing the final rules.EPA is evaluating continuous emission monitors for HCl, and it appearsthat accurate and reliable instruments may be available commercially. EPAspecifically requests comments on whether continuous emission monitoringfor HCl would be a feasible, practicable requirement in lieu of waste analysisfor chlorine to limit HCl emissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix H: Health Effects Data for Metals, HCl, and THC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A.
