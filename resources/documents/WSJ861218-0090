The $92-a-share offer, which Forstmann Little presented to Lear Siegler's board Tuesday, appears to end two months of wrenching uncertainty for the Santa Monica, Calif., aerospace and industrial company, which saw two other offers unravel in recent weeks.    The transaction would also be the largest buyout ever for Forstmann Little. The firm has reaped rich returns from leveraged buyouts in the mid-hundred-million-dollar range, but has so far been stymied in efforts to close billion-dollar transactions.    Forstmann Little said it will launch a tender offer in the next five business days for all Lear Siegler common and convertible preferred stock. The tender offer will be subject to Forstmann Little's purchase of at least a majority of Lear Siegler's common.    Lear Siegler stock, which had declined steadily in the past four weeks after being one of the market's most volatile issues in recent months, soared $14.125 yesterday on the news of Forstmann's bid, closing at $89.625 on volume of 2,213,000 shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Lear Siegler preferred jumped $37.50 to close at $223.50. Forstmann Little said it will offer $230 for each of Lear Siegler's 156,000 preferred shares.    Officials at both companies said Forstmann Little currently doesn't plan to replace Lear Siegler managers. The officials said Lear Siegler's management would be an equity partner in the leveraged buyout, though they didn't specify the precise stake managers would own.    A Lear Siegler spokesman said the company's current study of possible restructuring moves, including a possible sale of some assets, will continue. While Lear hasn't described its restructuring plans, an industry source previously said that Lear has been discussing the sale of its Piper Aircraft operations, whose estimated annual sales are about $100 million.    Forstmann Little first approached Lear Siegler shortly after the company received an unsolicited $85-a-share offer in October from AFG Partners, according to one Wall Street source. It didn't elicit any interest from Lear Siegler, the source added.    AFG's bid was quickly overshadowed by a $93-a-share offer in mid-November from Wickes Cos. But Wickes, also based in Santa Monica, abruptly backed away from its bid after it had trouble arranging satisfactory bank financing.    After Wickes's offer collapsed, AFG, which had sold all its Lear Siegler stock, bought a new 4.7% stake in the company and renewed its offer. But this week it withdrew its bid, citing new tax uncertainties. Forstmann Little didn't discuss its bid with AFG, according to a source close to Forstmann.    An AFG spokesman declined to comment on the Forstmann Little bid, except to repeat its previous statement that it would be interested in participating in any Lear Siegler restructuring. AFG Partners, a partnership between AFG Industries Inc., Irvine Calif., and Wagner andamp; Brown, Midland, Texas, is said to be especially interested in Lear Siegler's profitable auto glass business.    AFG will earn a hefty profit from its investment in Lear Siegler if the Forstmann Little bid succeeds. The AFG partnership paid an average of $80.08 for each of its 850,000 Lear Siegler shares, indicating a profit of $10.1 million.    A spokesman for Wickes, a manufacturing and retailing concern that has been actively looking for acquisition candidates in several industries, declined to comment on the announcement by Lear Siegler and Forstmann Little. Wickes still retains the 1.8 million Lear Siegler shares it had acquired from AFG Partners at $91 a share, or a total of $160 million.    Norman A. Barkeley, Lear Siegler's chairman and president, said in a statement that the Forstmann Little transaction &quot;satisfies our board's objective of delivering optimal value to our shareholders.&quot; But the company declined to make any officials available for interviews.    To analysts who follow Lear Siegler, the $92-a-share buyout price was surprisingly high. &quot;I think the market was expecting something around $80 to $85,&quot; said Jon D. Gruber of Montgomery Securities, San Francisco. &quot;I guess Wickes must be happy,&quot; he said, noting that the buyout price barely tops what Wickes had paid for its 10% stake.    By making a tender offer for Lear Siegler, Forstmann Little can quickly gain control of the company, forestalling any rival bids. The offer will be made by L Acquisition Corp., a company organized by Forstmann Little. Lear Siegler said that the transaction will ultimately be structured as a leveraged buyout.    Forstmann Little will put up between $500 million and $1 billion to purchase Lear Siegler, borrowing the balance from banks, according to a Wall Street source. The firm has about $1.6 billion in cash at its disposal, most of it raised from big institutional investors. The investors include the pension funds of General Electric Co., Boeing Co., GTE Corp. and Amoco Corp.    Founded in 1978 by Theodore J. Forstmann, his brother Nicholas, and William B. Little, the firm has repaid its investors handsomely through a string of medium-sized leveraged buyouts. For instance, an investment fund that Forstmann Little raised in 1983 had average annual returns of more than 30% on its subordinated debt and more than 95% on its equity. In one of its best-known recent transactions, the firm squeezed an 8.5-to-1 return out of its 1984 leveraged buyout of Dr Pepper Co., by disposing of assets and ultimately selling the rest of the company in August.    But the firm has encountered difficulty in completing large transactions. Last year it was outbid in its nearly $1 billion offer for McGraw-Edison Co. and in its $1.81 billion offer for Revlon Inc.    In year ended June 30, Lear earned $55.5 million, or $3.02 a share, compared with $100.7 million, or $5.51 a share, the year earlier. Sales rose to $2.46 billion from $2.37 billion, but the company's aerospace business and its Piper Aircraft business-plane line performed poorly.    In addition to its aerospace business, Lear Siegler's best-known product lines include Smith andamp; Wesson firearms and Safelite auto glass.    While aerospace accounted for a third of sales, it contributed only 10% of pre-tax operating profit. Perhaps the business's biggest trouble spot was heavy product-liability claims at Piper, which already was being hurt by softness in the business-plane market.    Lear's fiscal first-quarter net climbed 42% from a year earlier to $16.5 million, or 92 cents a share, on a 12% rise in sales to $597.8 million. It cited its automotive and aerospace divisions as the largest contributors, and said that a $31 million charge it took in the fiscal fourth quarter to increase reserves for Piper had helped improve the unit's position for the new year.    Lear Siegler was advised by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Lear retained Goldman as an additional investment banker three weeks ago when Wickes announced it was having trouble arranging financing for its proposed merger. </TEXT></DOC>
