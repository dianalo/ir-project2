This is especially so with baroque opera.;   Love-entanglement plots that might fill three minutes of a TV soap opera canballoon into a featherweight four-hour concoction. Violence all occursoff-stage. Orchestras are small and archaic. Singers sing the wrong-sex roles,in travesti. And in the ultimate economy, trills are usually done withrepetitions of just a single note.;    San Jose weathered all these arcaneartifices in Francesco Cavalli's wild and weird &quot;L'Ormindo.&quot; The work is soracy that I watched to see if blue-nosed National Endowment for the Artsagents would charge in to yank NEA financial support and padlock the showprior to intermission.;    No such luck.;    Illicit embraces;  You thoughtthe 1640s were staid times? The swinging Venetians did their damnedest todispel the notion. The curtain of the opera goes up on a young and shapelycat-on-a-hot-tin-roof queen, yearning for illicit embraces from Ormindo andanother swain that the doddering old king of a husband doesn't know about.;   Candor? She waltzes off to the bedroom with Ormindo while her husband's backis turned, then puts out to sea with the enamorato on a love boat. Each of thesupporting characters is a sex-preoccupied comic, commenting longingly on thecrown-askew action.;    Producer Daniel Helfgot brought off this steamymusical-beds game with busy comedy, inspired perhaps by the style ofJean-Pierre Ponnelle. The action was tightly choreographed, with hardly aslack minute. The show was vibrant with consummate, cheeky pizazz, and I'd saythat firmly even if the Mercury News were not the show's main underwriter.;   The static nature of the baroque form -- consisting of long pairs ofrecitative and aria, with a few duets -- was overwhelmed by extravaganthedonism, deft scene changes, go-go action, an atmospheric Moorish setting,uproarious males in female-like roles, and surprisingly fine singing.;    Moreduets;    Where Cavalli improved on other baroque conventions was in thebreaking up of solo arias, allowing a second performer to alternate on thetext, allowing a quasi-conversation.;    Conductor Barbara Day Turner wiselyshelved the overinflated Raymond Leppard performing version in vogue since1967. She had to make her own scaled-down edition, one much more consistentwith old Venetian norms and vocal ornamentation (though without any help fromthe musicologists re matters of authentic interpretation). It sounded 17thcentury, right down to the elaborate vocal lines for the supporting cast.;   A special treat in the cast was the man who may be the world's reigningsoprano-falsettist, Randall Wong of San Francisco. The thirtyish Wong singsthe elevated lines of Nerillo the page with lyric effortlessness andandrogynous ease, even when yanked about stage by an antsy entourage. His toneis pleasing and seemingly natural, distinct in texture from both high-voicewomen and boys.;    Tenor Dan Montez finally came into his own as Ormindo,projecting a true, intense lyric voice lacking only the soft warm shades ofcolor. The deep male voices of Douglas Nagel and Ronald Gerard wereimpressive, but the high voices stole the show. A prime act somewhere betweenZero Mostel and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; came via the bouncy character tenor RossHalper in the travesty part of the rotund old nurse Erice.;    Some roles weredouble-cast. On opening night Susan Gundunas was the consummate queen Erisbe,as alluring of voice as of appearance, and seductive in both. Baritone DavidCox as the also-ran swain Amida had the voice but needed more dash, along witha less banker-like bedside manner.;    Next step: Rent out Helfgot's tersesurtitle translations and Turner's effective score to other troupes for theirown &quot;Ormindos.&quot; That also goes for set designer Ken Holamon's ingeniousMoorish palace with multiple sliding panels -- a set that could also serve&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio,&quot; &quot;The Italian in Algiers,&quot; and several otherharem-oriented opera-fantasies. This is Holamon's most elaborate set,requiring the maximum of imagination for this minimum stage.;  Opera San Jose;'L'Ormindo,' by Francesco Cavalli; Italian with English surtitles; Where:Montgomery Theater, Market and San Carlos streets, San Jose; When: ThroughApril 27; Tickets: $10-$40, (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910415  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  786  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 15, 199100106040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
