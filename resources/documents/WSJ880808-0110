The Justice Department denied Nynex's request to operate a trans-Atlantic fiberoptic cable system with Britian's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC. The department said that while New York-based Nynex's participation in the joint venture wouldn't &quot;violate normal antitrust standards,&quot; the company failed to meet the more restrictive standards of the accord that broke up the Bell System in 1984.    Moreover, the Justice Department said it wasn't certain how the court could grant Nynex's request yet continue to exclude the other Bell companies from entering other long-distance services.    The regional Bell operating companies, including Nynex, were created as a result of the breakup. Nynex said it hopes to persuade the court to ease the accord's long-distance restrictions, since the Justice Department said its venture wouldn't violate normal antitrust standards.    Ivan Seidenberg, a Nynex senior vice president, said the company intends to &quot;actively seek&quot; approval to participate in the venture from federal Judge Harold Greene, who has overseen the Bell companies since the Bell System breakup. However, Judge Greene generally abides by the Justice Department's decisions.    The company suffered a heavy blow last month when Cable andamp; Wireless scrapped its agreement with Nynex because Nynex still hadn't received government approval to participate in the venture. The agreement stipulated that Cable andamp; Wireless would be free after May 1 to seek a new partner in the venture if Nynex hadn't obtained clearance by then. However, the British concern said it remains interested in reviving the agreement if Nynex gets court approval soon.    When the conditional agreement was terminated, Nynex forfeited its $10 million initial investment and lost its option to buy the stock of Private Trans-Atlantic Telephone Systems Inc., which owns the U.S. end of the undersea cable.    Nynex's request for a waiver of the long-distance prohibition in May 1987 marked the first time one of the regional Bells had sought permission to enter the long-distance business. The company had signaled its intention to apply for the waiver months before, and the plan had previously received approval from the Federal Communications Commission.    Pacific Telesis Group has expressed interest in a similar long-distance venture to the Far East, but has taken no formal action pending the outcome of the Nynex case. </TEXT></DOC>
