Legal Authority </ITAG>EPA is promulgating this regulation under the authority of Secs. 1401,1412, 1413, 1414, 1415, 1416, 1445, and 1450 of the Safe Drinking WaterAct, as amended. 42 U.S.C. 300f, 300g-1, 300g-2, 300g-3,  300g-4,  300g-5, 300j-4,  and  300j-9. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>A. Statutory Requirements The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (``SDWA'' or ``the Act''),Pub. L. 99-339, require EPA to promulgate a national primary drinking waterregulation (NPDWR) specifying criteria under which ``filtration'' (definedin section 1412(b)(7)(C)(i) as including pretreatment measures such ascoagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate) is required as a treatmenttechnique for public water systems supplied by surface water sources. Inestablishing these criteria, EPA must consider source water quality, protectionafforded by watershed management, treatment practices such as disinfectionand length of water storage, and other factors relevant to protection ofhealth. In lieu of provisions for obtaining a variance from the filtration requirementsunder section 1415 of the Act, EPA must instead specify procedures whichthe State is to use to determine which public systems must use filtrationbased on the criteria that EPA establishes in this regulation. NOTE: Throughoutthis preamble, the term ``State'' is used to mean a State with primaryenforcement responsibility for public water systems or ``primacy,'' andto mean EPA in the case of a State that has not obtained primacy. Statesmay require the public water system to provide studies or other informationto assist in this determination. The procedures for determining whetherfiltration is required must provide notice and opportunity for public hearing.EPA was to promulgate this NPDWR by December 19, 1987. In March 1988, theBull Run Coalition in Portland, Oregon sued the Agency for failure to issuethe rule by the statutory deadline. On January 17, 1989, a consent decreecommitting EPA to promulgate this rule by June 19, 1989 was filed in theDistrict Court of Oregon. Within 18 months after EPA promulgates the NPDWR specifying filtrationrequirements, a State with primary enforcement responsibility for publicwater systems must adopt any regulations necessary to implement the requirementsof this NPDWR. Within 12 months of the adoption of such regulations, theState must make determinations regarding filtration for all public watersystems supplied by surface waters within its jurisdiction. If the Statedetermines that filtration by a public water system is required, the Statemust prescribe a schedule for that system that requires compliance within18 months of the determination. The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act also required EPA, byJune 19, 1989, to: (1) Promulgate a NPDWR requiring disinfection as a treatmenttechnique for all  public water systems (including those served by surfacewater and those served by ground water) and a rule specifying criteriaby which variances to this requirement may be granted; and (2) publishmaximum contaminant level goals and promulgate NPDWRs for 83 contaminantslisted in the Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking published at 47 FR9352 (March 4, 1982) and 48 FR 45502 (October 5, 1983). This list of contaminantsincludes turbidity and five microbiological contaminants: <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>(``<T3>Giardia</T3>''), viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, Heterotrophic Plate Count bacteria (``heterotrophicbacteria'' or ``HPC''), and total coliforms.B. Regulatory History In the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on October 5, 1983,EPA discussed issues pertaining to regulation of turbidity, <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, and HPC, as well as filtration treatment for surfacewater and disinfection requirements for all systems (48 FR 45502). On November13, 1985, EPA proposed MCLGs for turbidity, <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, and viruses and solicited comment on the appropriatenessof establishing MCLGs and NPDWRs for <T3>Legionella </T3>and HPC (50 FR 46936). (In this rule ``viruses'' meansviruses of fecal origin which are infectious to humans by waterborne transmission.``<T3>Legionella</T3>'' means a genus of bacteria, some species of whichhave caused a type of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease; the etiologicagent of most cases of Legionnaires disease examined has been <T3>L. pneumophila.</T3>) Public comments on these two <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices and EPA's responses to the comments areincluded in the Response to Comments document in the public docket forthis rulemaking (USEPA, 1989d). On November 3, 1987, EPA: (1) Reproposed MCLGs for <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>and viruses, and proposed an MCLG for <T3>Legionella</T3>; (2) proposed a national primary drinking water regulationspecifying (a) criteria under which filtration (including coagulation andsedimentation, as appropriate) is required as a treatment technique forpublic water systems using surface water sources and procedures by whichthe State must determine which systems must install filtration and (b)disinfection treatment technique requirements for public water systemsusing surface water sources (52 FR 42178). The proposed filtration anddisinfection requirements were intended to protect against the potentialadverse health effects of exposure to <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, and heterotrophic bacteria, as well as many otherpathogenic organisms that are removed by these treatment techniques. TheNovember 3, 1987, notice also withdrew the November 13, 1985, proposedMCLG for turbidity and proposed certain limits on turbidity as criteriafor: (1) Determining whether a public water system is required to filter;and (2) determining whether filtration, if required, is adequate. On January 7, 1988, EPA published a notice extending the public commentperiod on these proposed surface water treatment requirements (53 FR 1892).On May 6, 1988, EPA published a Notice of Availability which solicitedspecific data, discussed alternatives to the proposed surface water treatmentrequirements and solicited comment on these alternative options, and designatedJuly 5, 1988, as the end of the public comment period (53 FR 16348). C. Regulatory Framework As explained in greater detail in the proposal, this rule fulfills thefollowing statutory requirements: (1) The requirement that EPA promulgate a NPDWR specifying criteria underwhich filtration (including coagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate)is required as a treatment technique for public water systems using surfacewater sources, including procedures by which the State will determine whichsystems must install filtration. <T3>See </T3>section 1412(b)(7)(C). (2) The requirement that EPA promulgate a NPDWR requiring disinfectionas a treatment technique for public water systems using surface water sources(EPA intends to promulgate additional regulations specifying disinfectionrequirements for systems using ground water sources at a later date). <T3>See </T3>section 1412(b)(8). (3) The requirement that EPA regulate <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, heterotrophic plate count bacteria, and turbidity.<T3>See </T3>section 1412(b)(1). (Coliforms are regulated in a separaterule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.) (a) <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts pose significant risks to health for systemsusing surface waters, but usually not for systems using ground water, becausethese protozoan cysts are removed from water by natural filtration processesin the course of the water's passage through the ground. The turbiditylevel, which is a measure of particulate matter in water, is an indicatorof the effectiveness of treatment processes that control pathogens, including<T3>Giardia</T3>, in systems using surface water. Turbidity is not a usefulindicator of treatment effectiveness for most ground water systems sincemost particulates are already being removed by natural filtration processesin the course of the water's passage through the ground. Because naturalfiltration processes remove turbidity and <T3>Giardia </T3>from ground water, EPA believes that promulgation of thisregulation, which applies to public water systems using surface water sources(or, as explained later, ground water sources under the direct influenceof surface water) and includes turbidity requirements, is adequate to controlthese contaminants, so additional NPDWRs to regulate <T3>Giardia </T3>and turbidity in ground water are unnecessary. Thus, itis EPA's position that today's regulation fulfills the SDWA requirementto regulate <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>and turbidity. (b) This rule also provides protection from viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, and HPC in surface water and thereby complies withthe SDWA requirement to regulate these contaminants in surface water systems.EPA intends to promulgate NPDWRs to control the levels of viruses, <T3>Legionella</T3>, and HPC in drinking water derived from ground watersources. These regulations will be included in the disinfection requirementsfor ground water sources.The criteria in this final rule are designed to control microbiologicalcontamination in general, not just <T3>Giardia lamblia,</T3> viruses, <T3>Legionella,</T3> and HPC. Since no waterborne disease outbreaks havebeen identified in properly designed, well-operated systems, i.e., systemsthat meet these criteria, EPA believes that compliance with this rule willprovide significant protection from most waterborne pathogens, includingthose not specifically covered by this rule. For instance, EPA believesthat filtered systems which comply with the requirements of this rule forsuch systems will provide significant protection from <T3>Cryptosporidium,</T3> a protozoan recently implicated in waterbornedisease outbreaks. However, because of the current uncertainty of the effectivenessof disinfection for inactivating <T3>Cryptosporidium,</T3> the degree of protection from this protozoanfor systems which choose to comply with the requirements of this rule forunfiltered systems may be more limited. EPA is currently conducting studiesto determine whether additional regulations may be necessary to controlfor <T3>Cryptosporidium.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Response to Major Issues </ITAG>In this section, EPA describes the major comments it received on the proposedcriteria, which provisions of the final rule have been changed in responseto those comments, and the rationale for those changes. EPA's more detailedresponses to the public comments appear in the Response to Comments documentin the public docket. (USEPA, 1989b.) This section is presented prior tothe description of the final rule (Section IV) and assumes the reader isfamiliar with the proposed rule. Therefore, depending on interest and background,the reader may prefer to either skip this section or read Section IV first.A. Determination of Source Water Type Under the proposed rule, ``surface water'' was defined as<ITAG tagnum="21">All water (1) open to the atmosphere and subject to surface runoff,or (2) which is directly influenced by surface water, as defined in (1),which may include springs, infiltration galleries, or wells. Whether thereis direct influence by surface water must be determined on a case-by-casebasis. Direct influence may be indicated by: (i) significant and relativelyrapid shifts in water characteristics such as turbidity, temperature, conductivity,or pH (which may also change in ground water but at a much slower rate)which closely correlate to climatologic or surface water conditions, or(ii) the presence of insects or other macroorganisms, algae, organic debris,or large-diameter pathogens such as <T3>Giardia lamblia.</T3></ITAG>Some commenters supported the definition because it would allow Statesto require treatment to control for <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, if such contamination were apparent, in systemsusing sources traditionally classified as ground water. Other commentersobjected to the definition because it included aquifers, depending uponhow the term ``direct influence by surface water'' was interpreted. Aquifers,for the most part, are protected from contaminants, such as <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, which are characteristic of surface water supplies;thus, they argue, it is not necessary to subject these systems to thisrule. Many commenters were concerned that the proposed definition wouldrequire States to evaluate all ground water systems to determine whetherthey were under the direct influence of surface water within 30 monthsfollowing the promulgation of the rule. Commenters considered this impracticalbecause of the limited resources available to States. EPA agrees that most systems using sources traditionally defined as groundwater are not at risk from contamination by <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts or other contaminants typically found in surfacewater. The rate of reported waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis in systemsusing ground water (as traditionally defined, i.e., water not open to theatmosphere) is about 1/43 of that in filtered and disinfected surface watersupplies and about 1/326 of that in unfiltered surface water supplies (Craun,1989). However, <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts do occur in some ground water supplies due to contaminationby surface water (e.g., springs, infiltration galleries, and wells; Hibler,1987a). Therefore, EPA believes it is appropriate that all ground watersystems be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, for the potential of contaminationby <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. EPA believes that a system at significant riskfrom contamination of<T3> Giardia</T3> cysts, i.e., a ground water system under the direct influenceof surface water where the structure of the system cannot be altered toreduce this risk, should be required to comply with the treatment requirementsof this rule to ensure adequate protection of public health. Based on information provided in public comments and further consideration,EPA agrees that the statutory timeframe for States to make filtration decisions(i.e., 30 months from promulgation of this rule) does not provide adequatetime for States to evaluate which ground water systems are under the directinfluence of surface water. In addition, EPA believes the most practicalapproach for States is to make these determinations when sanitary surveysare conducted pursuant to the NPDWR for total coliforms (published elsewherein today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>) and/or when ground water systems are evaluatedfor adequacy of treatment under the forthcoming disinfection requirementsfor ground water systems. EPA is also concerned that if a system using a ground water source werereclassified as a ``surface water source'' because the State determinesit is under the direct influence of surface water, as described in theproposal, such a system also would be required to comply with other regulationspertaining to surface water supplies (e.g., under other NPDWRs, surfacewater supplies have different monitoring requirements than ground watersupplies). This may or may not be appropriate, depending upon the characteristicsof the system. EPA has addressed the above concerns by making the following changes inthe final rule: a. The definition of surface water has been shortened to ``all water opento the atmosphere and subject to surface runoff.'' b. The final rule defines a new term, ``ground water under direct influenceof surface water,'' as:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any water beneath the surface of the ground with (i) significant occurrenceof insects or other macroorganisims, algae, or large-diameter pathogenssuch as <T3>Giardia lamblia,</T3> or (ii) significant and relatively rapid shiftsin water characteristics such as turbidity, temperature, conductivity,or pH which closely correlate to climatological or surface water conditions.Direct influence must be determined for individual sources in accordancewith criteria established by the State. The State determination of directinfluence may be based on an evaluation of site-specific measurements ofwater quality and/or well construction characteristics and geology withfield evaluation.</ITAG>c. When the State revises its drinking water regulations to adopt today'srule, the revisions must include a program for determining which systemsusing ground water as a source are under the direct influence of surfacewater (i) within 5 years following the promulgation date of this rule forcommunity water systems, and (ii) within 10 years following the promulgationdate of this rule for non-community water systems. These timeframes areconsistent with the schedule for conducting sanitary surveys under thetotal coliform rule, promulgated elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> EPA believes these time frames are reasonablebecause the sanitary surveys will provide much of the information necessaryto make the determination. d. All unfiltered ground water systems that the State determines are underthe direct influence of surface water must (i) begin monitoring 6 monthsfollowing the determination to demonstrate they are meeting the criteriato avoid filtration and comply with the requirements for avoiding filtrationbeginning 18 months following the determination, unless the State determinesthat filtration is required, or (ii) install filtration and comply withthe monitoring and treatment requirements for filtered systems beginning18 months following the determination that filtration is required. Thisschedule is explained in more detail in the section entitled ``Compliance,''below. Guidance for evaluating whether ground water systems are under the directinfluence of surface water will be available in the final Guidance Manual.EPA recommends that infiltration galleries, springs, and shallow wellsbe evaluated first, then, depending upon aquifer characteristics, wellsin increasing depth. EPA believes that, for most ground water systems,only minimal analysis will be necessary to make this determination. Simplyput, if a ground water system is subject to <T3>Giardia</T3> contamination (unless the contamination originates withinthe distribution system), States should classify it as a source under thedirect influence of surface water and thus subject to the treatment requirementsof this rule. It is important to note that the intent of this rule is notto regulate viral and bacterial contamination in systems using ground water,unless <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts are also associated with such occurrence. Thus,if there is little likelihood for <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts to occur in a system using ground water, but thereis potential for bacterial and viral contamination, EPA does not expectthe State to classify this source as a ground water source under the directinfluence of surface water. Compliance with the NPDWR for total coliforms(published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>) and/or the forthcoming disinfection requirementsfor disinfection of ground water systems will require adequate treatmentto address these other concerns. EPA anticipates that while some ground water systems, such as infiltrationgalleries, springs, and shallow wells, may be under direct influence ofsurface water in their current configuration, in many cases, it may bepossible to make structural modifications to prevent the direct influenceof surface water and eliminate the potential for <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst contamination, thereby avoiding the requirementsof this rule.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Throughout the remainder of this preamble, unless otherwisenoted, we use the term ``surface water systems'' and related terms to includeboth public water systems using a surface water source and public watersystems using a ground water source under the direct influence of surfacewater. </ITAG>B. 99.9 Percent Removal and/or Inactivation of Giardia Cysts EPA proposed to require all systems using surface water to achieve at leasta 99.9 percent (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts. Many commenters thought it inappropriateto require the same minimum percent removal requirement for all systems,regardless of differences in source water quality and potential risk. Severalcommenters suggested that EPA allow exceptions to this minimum treatmentperformance requirement based on source water quality (e.g., low occurrenceof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts) and/or epidemiological evidence of low risk. Somecommenters thought that EPA should base the treatment requirement uponsome level of acceptable risk in the finished water. EPA continues to support the rationale presented in the preamble to theproposed rule for setting the minimum performance criteria of 99.9 percentremoval and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts (52 FR 42194-42195). Furthermore, additional informationhas become available to support these criteria. Table III.1 indicates peak and average <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst concentrations in polluted and pristine source watersof public drinking water supplies (Rose, 1988), where waters contaminatedwith sewage and agricultural wastes were characterized as ``polluted''and waters originating from protected watersheds with no significant sourcesof microbiological contamination from human activities were classifiedas ``pristine.'' The indicated concentration levels reflect actual countsof cysts detected without adjustment for inefficiencies in recovery (recoveryefficiencies were unknown for most samples). These data indicate that,even though average cyst concentrations can be significantly higher inpolluted than in pristine source waters, at least part of the year peakcyst concentration levels in pristine waters can be the same order of magnitudeas the levels in polluted supplies. Occasional high concentrations of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts in source waters with protected watersheds may occurdue to contamination from animal populations. Thus, during the part ofthe year when the water is most contaminated, i.e., the concentrationsof <T3>Giardia</T3> are the highest, approximately the same level of treatmentperformance is necessary for a pristine water source as is necessary fora polluted source to provide the same level of protection.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> Table III.</T4>1_<T4>Giardia Cyst Densities in Sources of Drinking Water \1\</T4><H1>Type of water</H1><H1>Number of samples</H1><H1>Number of sites</H1><H1>Percent \2\ positive for Giardia</H1><H1>Cysts/100 liters</H1><H2>Peak</H2><H2>Range of mean concentrations \3\</H2><H2>Mean of all concentrations \3\</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Waters polluted with human and agricultural wastes <D>135</D><D> 8 </D><D>43 </D><D>625 </D><D>0.33-104 </D><D>33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pristine waters <D>283 </D><D>7 </D><D>10 </D><D>114 </D><D>0.6-5 </D><D>0.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Waters of unknown quality <D>1,226 </D><D>18 </D><D>26.4 </D><D>100 </D><D>0.005-2.95 </D><D>0.61</D><F>\1\ Rose, 1988.</F><F>\2\ Percent of the samples.</F><F>\3\ Geometric mean.</F></ITAG></ITAG>To date, in each reported waterborne disease outbreak of giardiasis, atleast 0.5 percent or greater of the population (50 or more per 10,000 peopleor 5 andmultiply; 10^3) were infected (Rose, 1988). EPA believes that publicwater supplies should provide much greater protection than simply thatnecessary to avoid this level of risk from waterborne disease. EPA believesthat providing treatment to ensure less than one case of microbiologicallycaused illness per year per 10,000 people is a reasonable goal. This iscomparable to other acceptable microbiological risk levels (Regli et al.,1988).Based on a recent risk analysis, which assumes all cysts found are viableand infectious to humans, the incidence of infection from <T3>Giardia</T3> was predicted as a function of exposure to cyst concentrationsin drinking water (Rose, 1988). Tables III.2 and III.3 indicate the dailyand annual risk from <T3>Giardia</T3> infection for people consuming finished water with different<T3> Giardia</T3> cyst concentrations. The tables also specify the levelof treatment (i.e., 3-, 4- or 5-log removal and/or inactivation of<T3> Giardia</T3> cysts) needed for source water with different cyst concentrationsto ensure that the indicated daily and annual risk per person are not exceeded. Comparing Table III.2 with Table III.1, it appears that water treatmentplants which provide 3-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts would generally ensure exposure to risk of giardiasisof less than 10^4 (i.e., less than one in 10,000 people infected) duringdays of worst case <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst occurrence (defined as 250 cysts/100 liters). ComparingTable III.3 with Table III.1, it appears that water treatment plants whichprovide 3- to 5-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, depending on source water quality (e.g., for waterswith less than 0.7 cysts/100 liters and 3-log removal and/or inactivation,or water with less than 70 cysts/100 liters and 5-log removal and/or inactivation),would generally ensure that the risk of giardiasis is less than 10^4 peryear. Although EPA recognizes that the above analysis may be conservative,it is not unreasonable since the cyst occurrence levels, as indicated inTable III.1, may actually be much higher due to poor efficiencies of recovery.EPA believes that 3- to 5-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts represents a reasonable level of protection forthe range of source water contamination expected to occur in the UnitedStates. Therefore, the final rule requires that all systems achieve atleast a 3-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. In the final Guidance Manual, EPA will recommendspecific minimum performance levels in the 3- to 5-log range, dependingupon the expected degree of cyst contamination in the source water.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>III.2_<T4>Estimated Daily Risk of Giardia Infections From Various Levels of CystContamination in Drinking Water Using an Exponential Risk Assessment Model\1\</T4><H1>Daily risk per person \2\</H1><H1>Cyst concentration in 100 liters of finished water</H1><H1>Allowable Cyst concentration in 100 liters of source water to achievegiven treatment reductions</H1><H2>3=log</H2><H2>4=log</H2><H2>5=log</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">10^3.5 <D>\3\ 0.75 </D><D>7.5andmultiply;10\2\ </D><D>7.5andmultiply;10\3\ </D><D>7.5andmultiply;10\4\ </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^4 <D>0.25 </D><D>2.5andmultiply;10\2\ </D><D>2.5andmultiply;10\3\ </D><D>2.5andmultiply;10\4\ </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^4.5 <D>0.075 </D><D>75 </D><D>7.5andmultiply;10\2\ </D><D>7.5andmultiply;10\3\ </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^5 <D>0.025 </D><D>25 </D><D>2.5andmultiply;10\2\ </D><D>2.5andmultiply;10\3\  </D><F>\1\ Rose, 1988. </F><F>\2\ Assumes 2 liters of water consumed per day. </F><F>\3\ Level of cysts detected during waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s50,10,8.2,9.1,9.1 </C><T4>Table </T4>III.3_<T4>Estimated Annual Risk of Giardia Infections From Various Levels ofCyst Contamination in Drinking Water Using an Exponential Risk AssessmentModel \1\</T4><H1>Annual risk per person \2\</H1><H1>Geometric mean cyst concentration in 100 liters of finished water forone year</H1><H1>Allowable Cyst concentration in 100 liters of source water to achievegiven treatment reductions</H1><H2>3=log</H2><H2>4=log</H2><H2>5=log</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">10^3.5 <D>2andmultiply;10</D>^3 <D>2.0 </D><D>20 </D><D>200 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^4 <D>7andmultiply;10</D>^4 <D>0.7 </D><D>7.0 </D><D>70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^4.5 <D>2andmultiply;10</D>^4 <D>0.2 </D><D>2.0 </D><D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10^5 <D>7andmultiply;10</D>^5 <D>0.07 </D><D>0.7 </D><D>7.0  </D><F>\1\ Rose, 1988. </F><F>\2\ Assumes 2 liters of water consumed per day.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The treatment performance levels cited above are consistent with what iscurrently being achieved by well-operated systems in the U.S. Figures III.1and III.2 illustrate levels of <T3>Giardia </T3>cyst inactivation achieved by disinfection alone duringwinter and summer months, respectively, by typical filtered water suppliesin the U.S. (based on data from AWWA (1987)). Assuming a 2- to 3-log removalof <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts by conventional treatment (which is used by mostof the utilities represented in Figures III.1 and III.2) without disinfection,a total of at least 3- to 5-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts from filtration and disinfection combined is generallyachieved in well-operated water treatment plants in the U.S.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 54-55</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>EPA believes it is inappropriate for the rule to specify different levelsof treatment for different source water qualities because it is generallynot feasible to confidently quantify <T3>Giardia </T3>cyst concentrations. As explained in the proposal, thereis no analytical method for measuring <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts for which the precision, efficiency, andsensitivity have been adequately defined; no reliable validation proceduresor laboratory certification procedures are available; and very large numbersof samples would be needed to accurately quantify levels of cyst occurrence.Although some systems might not actually need a 3-log removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts to provide adequately safe water to their customers,EPA believes it is not feasible for a system to demonstrate with assurance,e.g., with water quality monitoring results, that lower removals and/orinactivations would be adequately protective of public health. Nor is thehistorical absence of a waterborne disease outbreak a sufficiently sensitiveindicator that adequate treatment is in place. For example, assuming thatat least 0.5 percent of the population must become ill within less thanone month to detect an outbreak, the ongoing absence of an outbreak simplyindicates that fewer than 5 people per thousand become ill during any month.EPA also believes that generally it cannot be demonstrated with confidencethat low levels of waterborne illness (e.g., less than one in 10,000 peopleper year) are being avoided based on epidemiological analysis of reportedillnesses to the medical community, since only illnesses with a significantadverse symptomatic response tend to be reported and such reports onlyrepresent levels of illness among non-transient populations. Also, levelsof illness may vary significantly from year to year depending on the levelof contamination and variations in pathogen strains which might occur inthe source water, and the level of treatment provided. Therefore, to assurethat adequate protection will be provided, the final rule does not allowsystems to achieve less than a 3-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts. C. Continuous Disinfection at the Entry Point to the Distribution SystemEPA proposed to require that all systems using surface water (both unfilteredand filtered) disinfect their water and continuously monitor the disinfectantresidual entering the distribution system. Under the proposal, each systemwould record the lowest disinfectant residual concentration entering thesystem each day. Any time the residual was less than 0.2 mg/1, the systemwould be in violation of a treatment technique requirement. This violationwould be considered ``acute,'' thus requiring the system, under the publicnotification requirements in 40 CFR 141.32, to notify the public of theviolation within 72 hours via electronic media, as well as provide subsequentwritten notice, if it were a community water system; non-community watersystems could substitute posting or hand delivery of notices. In responseto this proposed requirement, EPA received the following comments:andbullet; The short-term absence of a disinfectant residual at the entrypoint to the distribution system should not automatically trigger immediatepublic notification since the actual health risks, depending upon site-specificcircumstances, may not be significant. andbullet; Continuous monitoring equipment is subject to failure; such failuresare generally beyond the control of the operator. Thus, such failure shouldnot be classified as either a monitoring violation or a treatment techniqueviolation. andbullet; Continuous monitoring is unnecessary to demonstrate effectiveongoing disinfection and it will not result in any increased health benefit.Grab sample monitoring every four hours is sufficient for large systems;one sample per day is adequate and reasonable for small systems. andbullet; The cost for very small systems to install continuous monitoringequipment is excessive (cited as about $5,000 for one analyzer and continuousrecorder or $10,000 with another unit as a backup) and maintenance wouldbe difficult. In response to the comments on the proposal, in the May 6, 1988, noticeof availability, EPA solicited comments on various options for revisingthe continuous disinfection requirement. Most commenters addressing theseoptions supported the changes. Based on these comments, and the reasonsexplained below, EPA has modified the proposed disinfection requirementsin the final rule as follows: andbullet; If the residual is less than 0.2 mg/l for any period of time,the system must notify the State as soon as possible but no later thanby the end of the next business day after it is first detected. andbullet; If the residual measured is less than 0.2 mg/l and it has notbeen restored to 0.2 mg/l or higher within four hours of the first measurement,then the system is in violation of a treatment technique requirement. Underthe final rule, this violation is a Tier 1 violation (see the public notificationrules at 40 CFR 141.32) but is not defined as posing an ``acute'' healthrisk, so immediate public notification by electronic media, posting, orhand delivery (depending on system type) is not required unless the Statedetermines it is appropriate. andbullet; If there is a failure in continuous monitoring equipment, grabsampling every four hours may be conducted for up to five working daysfollowing the failure of the equipment. Failure to use continuous monitoringequipment after the five days have passed is a monitoring violation. andbullet; Systems serving 3,300 people or fewer may take grab samples, atthe frequencies described below, in lieu of performing continuous monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,9</C> <H1>System size by population</H1><H1>Samples/day \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andCx.190;500<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">501 to 1,000<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 2,500<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,501 to 3,300<D>4</D><F>\1\ The day's samples cannot be taken at the same time.

Some systems that experience a brief reduction intheir disinfection process, depending on source water quality and whetherother treatment processes are in place, may expose the population to significanthealth risk while others may not. Thus, EPA agrees that it is inappropriateto categorically define a short-term reduction in the disinfection residualas a violation which poses an ``acute'' health risk, thus requiring immediatepublic notification via electronic media, posting, or hand delivery (dependingon system type). Instead, EPA believes that States should make these determinationsas appropriate. Similarly, since all systems are prone to operational failureat some time, but not all such situations pose a significant health risk,EPA believes that some time interval should be allowed for systems to restorethe disinfectant residual rather than categorically defining this absenceas a treatment technique violation. EPA believes that once the system becomesaware that the disinfectant concentration level is low or absent, fourhours is a reasonable maximum time interval for operators to adjust and/orrepair the disinfection or monitoring equipment or to bring backup disinfectionor monitoring units on-line. EPA agrees with the commenters that, for some small systems, it may notbe practical to keep monitoring units in continuous operation. Therefore,in the final rule, EPA is allowing grab sampling for small systems. EPAbelieves that requiring a minimum of one grab sample daily will ensurethat the operator checks on the disinfection process at least once a day.In the May 6, 1988, notice, EPA suggested that grab sample monitoring onceper day be allowed for systems serving 500 people or fewer; EPA also solicitedcomment on whether grab sampling should be allowed for some larger systemsas well. Several commenters suggested that the rule allow grab samplingfor systems serving fewer than 3,300 people, but at higher frequenciesthan required for systems serving fewer than 500 people. EPA considersthis suggestion reasonable and has modified the criteria in the final ruleaccordingly.D. Disinfectant Residual in the Distribution SystemEPA proposed to require all systems using surface water (both filteredand unfiltered) to maintain at least a 0.2 mg/l disinfection residual ingreater than or equal to 95 percent of the distribution system samplestaken each month. If a system failed to comply with this requirement forany two consecutive months, it would be in violation of a treatment techniquerequirement. Also, unfiltered systems failing to meet this criterion wouldbe required to filter. The purpose of this criterion was to:andbullet; Ensure that the distribution system is properly maintained andidentify and limit contamination from outside the distribution system whenit might occur;andbullet; Limit growth of heterotrophic bacteria and <T3>Legionella</T3> within the distribution system; andandbullet; Provide a quantitative limit which, if exceeded, would triggerremedial action.EPA proposed a minimum disinfectant residual of 0.2 mg/l because it believedthat maintenance of such levels are generally feasible for most well-operatedsystems. However, public comments indicate that, for many systems whichare well-operated (as evidenced by low levels of HPC in routine monitoring),it is not feasible to maintain the proposed minimum disinfectant residualwithout significantly changing existing disinfection practice (e.g., increasingexisting chlorine dosages or switching to chloramine disinfection for thedistribution system).Based on these comments and additional information about current disinfectionpractice, EPA has revised the proposal. The final rule requires ``detectable''residuals in lieu of residuals of at least 0.2 mg/l. In addition, sitesthat do not have ``detectable'' residuals, but have HPC measurements of500/ml or less, are considered equivalent to sites with ``detectable''residuals for purposes of determining compliance. Thus, under the finalrule, a system may measure for either disinfectant residual or HPC at anysampling location. EPA solicited comments on these options in the May 6,1988, notice of availability (53 FR 16352), and most commenters respondingto this issue supported these alternatives.EPA believes the absence of a disinfectant residual, rather than the presenceof a disinfectant residual below some specific level, is a more accurateindicator of potential contamination at a site. The absence of a residualat a site within the distribution system indicates that the disinfectantlevel has been reduced, possibly as a result of localized contaminationfrom outside the distribution system (e.g., via cross-connections or backsiphonage) or from organic or inorganic materials within the distributionsystem (such materials, especially in the absence of a residual, may beof concern because they can serve as nutrients that enhance microbial growth).However, EPA recognizes that the absence of a disinfectant residual ata distribution system site does not necessarily indicate microbiologicalcontamination; such contaminants simply may not be present, even in theabsence of a disinfectant residual. In other words, if microbial populationsare low, the lack of a disinfectant residual is not a concern. Therefore,in the final rule, sites with HPC populations of 500/ml or less are consideredequivalent to sites with detectable disinfectant residuals for purposesof determining compliance. EPA believes the 500/ml HPC limit is generallyfeasible for most well-operated systems with well-maintained distributionsystems and that water below this limit is unlikely to be subject to localizedcontamination or significant microbial growth.In addition to the changes described above, EPA has added several otherprovisions to the final rule. Some commenters thought the proposed requirementwas inappropriate for systems which introduce both undisinfected groundwater and disinfected surface water into the same distribution system becausedilution by the ground water (which is presumably clean and thus need notbe disinfected) might lower the residual concentration below 0.2 mg/l.In this case, they argued, the requirement was both inappropriate and verydifficult to meet. Therefore, for systems which have both ground and surfacewaters entering the distribution system, the State may allow monitoringfor disinfectant residuals at points other than the sampling locationsfor total coliforms if such points are more representative of the treated(disinfected) surface water within the distribution system.For systems which cannot maintain a disinfectant residual in the distributionsystem, if the State determines, based on site-specific considerations,that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzedfor HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite conditions (i.e.,if analysis cannot begin within 8 hours on samples maintained at temperaturesbelow 4anddegrees; C, with the maximum elapsed time between collection andanalysis under 30 hours; APHA, 1985), and adequate disinfection is providedby that system, this disinfection requirement does apply. The State's judgmentmight be based upon knowledge of the public water system's distributionsystem, maintenance of a cross-connection control program, source waterquality, and/or past coliform monitoring results.EPA added this provision for systems which cannot monitor for HPC for thefollowing reasons:andbullet; The option of measuring HPC usually is not available to smallsystems because they generally do not have in-house laboratory capabilityto perform the analysis themselves and it is generally not feasible totake samples and send them to a private laboratory within the specifiedtime limit, under the prescribed conditions.andbullet; The integrity of the distribution system is much easier to assessin a small system than in larger systems. Also, the residence time in thedistribution system of a small system is expected to be much lower thanin larger systems, thereby minimizing the time for bacterial populationsto grow in the water.Under the proposed rule, a system would be required to filter if it failedto meet the criteria for maintaining a disinfectant residual in the distributionsystem. Commenters objected to this criterion as a condition for avoidingfiltration because the failure to meet this criterion might be caused bycontamination entering the piping network within the distribution systemrather than by source water contamination and failure to provide filtration.EPA has modified the proposed rule to address this concern. Under the finalrule, systems are only required to filter if the failure to meet the disinfectionrequirements for the distribution system is caused by a deficiency in treatmentof the source water. However, any failure to meet the disinfection requirementsfor the distribution system, regardless of cause, is still considered aviolation of a treatment technique requirement.EPA believes that the revised criteria fulfill the same objectives of theproposed criteria, but are more sensitive to site-specific considerations.Compared to the proposed rule, the requirements in the final rule allowsystems to use less disinfectant in the distribution system, thus minimizingadverse effects from disinfectants and disinfection by-products. In addition,total costs will be lower because fewer systems will need to institutemajor changes in current treatment to meet the requirements of the finalrule.E. Watershed Control and On-Site Inspection RequirementsUnder the proposed rule, to avoid filtration, systems would be requiredto maintain a watershed control program which minimized the potential forcontamination by <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and viruses in the source water that wassatisfactory to the State. To avoid filtration, systems also were requiredto have an on-site sanitary survey performed each year that indicated tothe State's satisfaction that the disinfection treatment process and watershedcontrol program were adequately designed and maintained.Some commenters thought that these requirements should be more detailedso as to be more easily enforceable. EPA agrees. Thus the final rule includesadditional criteria which were taken from EPA's October 8, 1987 draft GuidanceManual (``draft Guidance Manual''), as suggested by public commenters.EPA believes that these revisions to the proposal make the criteria moreobjective and therefore more enforceable.EPA has also changed the term ``sanitary survey'' to ``on-site inspection''in the final rule. Under the existing National Primary Drinking Water Regulations,i.e., 40 CFR 141.2(f), a sanitary survey is defined as ``an onsite reviewof the water source, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance ofa public water system for the purpose of evaluating the adequacy of suchsources, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance for producingand distributing safe drinking water.'' EPA believes that, for the purposeof avoiding filtration, it is not necessary for systems to address concernswhich relate to the distribution system; it is sufficient that they considercriteria which relate to the effectiveness of the watershed control programand reliability of the disinfection treatment processes. Accordingly, theterm ``on-site inspection'' in the final rule refers to the evaluationof the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process.Although this rule only requires an on-site inspection rather than a sanitarysurvey to avoid filtration, EPA believes that all public water systems,including the systems covered by today's rule, should periodically undergothe more comprehensive sanitary survey, as defined in andSection; 141.2(f),to ensure regular evaluations of the distribution system as well as watershedand treatment characteristics. Many States already have programs in placefor conducting sanitary surveys, but at less frequent intervals than arerequired for on-site inspections in this rule. Under the total coliformrule, published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> EPA is requiring small systems, i.e., thosecollecting fewer than five total coliform samples/month, to have periodicsanitary surveys. Therefore, for unfiltered small systems, during the yearswhen the sanitary survey is conducted, the sanitary survey will fulfillboth the sanitary survey requirement of the coliform rule and the on-siteinspection requirement of this rule. In the final Guidance Manual, EPAwill provide guidelines for conducting both on-site inspections and sanitarysurveys.In an effort to streamline the regulatory implementation process for allthe new NPDWRs promulgated under the SDWA amendments, EPA is developingguidelines for States to use in making comprehensive vulnerability assessmentsof all public water supplies. The purpose of such an assessment would beto evaluate the vulnerability of a system for all potential contamination(i.e., microbiological, inorganic, and organic contamination in the sourcewater, contamination within the treatment train itself because of chemicaladdition, and contamination within the distribution system) and to obtaininformation for determining the most efficient strategy for bringing thesystem into compliance with all pertinent drinking water regulations. Theon-site inspections required under this rule for unfiltered supplies wouldconstitute one aspect of the comprehensive vulnerability assessment.F. Design and Operating RequirementsUnder the proposed rule, all systems would have been required to meet designand operating requirements specified by the State. Failure to meet anysuch requirement would be considered a violation of a treatment techniqueor monitoring requirement. Under andSection; 141.32, all treatment techniqueand monitoring violations require public notification.Most commenters thought it was unnecessary to classify design operatingrequirements as Federal treatment technique requirements since States alreadyhave such requirements (in fact, most States have permit systems in place),and if the system does not meet the State-specified design and operatingrequirements, the system is not allowed to operate. Many people commentingon this issue thought that EPA should allow States broad discretion todetermine when public notification would be appropriate if a system failedto meet design and operating criteria imposed by the State. As an example,one commenter pointed out that, under the proposal, if a State requireda public water system to monitor and meet turbidity performance criteriaat each individual filter (rather than requiring that the system only monitorthe combined effluent of all filtered water), and one filter of many withinthe system failed to meet the criteria, or the turbidity monitoring equipmentfor one filter failed, this would be a violation. The commenter arguedthat it would not be appropriate to require public notification in suchsituations.EPA agrees with commenters that there are likely to be many design andoperating criteria specified by the State which, if not met, would notwarrant public notification. Therefore, EPA has deleted from the finalrule the requirement that systems comply with design and operating conditionsspecified by the State. However, EPA has retained the proposed revisionto Part 142 requiring States to specify enforceable design and operatingcriteria on a Statewide or system-by-system basis. Thus, while failureto comply with State-specified design and operating criteria does not constitutea treatment technique violation, and public notification is not required,such a failure is a violation of State law.G. CT ValuesEPA received extensive public comments regarding the basis for the proposedCT values, the method of their calculation, and whether they should beincluded in the rules or just published as guidance. Major issues thatwere raised and how they have been addressed in the final rule are discussedin this section.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Unfiltered Systems</ITAG>(a) <T3>Calculation of CT values.</T3> Under the proposal, a system would berequired to calculate CT, where ``T'' is disinfectant contact time, thetime in minutes it takes the water to move between the point of disinfectantapplication and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourlyflow, and ``C'' is the residual disinfectant concentration in mg/l beforeor at the first customer but at or after the point contact time is measured.Many commenters thought this method of calculation was overly conservativebecause (a) significantly greater disinfectant residuals might be presentat previous points in the treatment train, (b) most customers will receivewater that has a much greater disinfectant contact time than does waterat or prior to the first customer, and (c) applying criteria in the draftGuidance Manual, which states that contact time should be determined basedon the time it takes water with 10 percent of the tracer concentrationto appear at the sampling site, will result in much shorter contact timesthan under less conservative guidelines (e.g., contact time defined asthe time it takes 50 percent of the tracer concentration to appear at thesampling site), and that such criteria are unnecessarily stringent.In the May 6, 1988, notice of availability, EPA solicited comments on adifferent methodology to determine CT values for systems using ozone. Allthe commenters who addressed this issue supported the adoption of thisprovision in the final rule. In addition, many commenters suggested applyingthis provision to all disinfectants. EPA agrees that this methodology,which allows systems to determine incremental contributions to the totalpercent inactivation based on a series of CT measurements prior to thefirst customer, results in a more accurate representation of actual disinfectionconditions, especially in systems having source waters with a high oxidantdemand, and those systems using ozone (because it dissipates very rapidly).Accordingly, EPA has adopted this methodology for all disinfectants inthe final rule.Thus, the revised methodology for calculating CT in the final rule is asfollows: Systems may measure ``C'' at different points along the treatmenttrain and use this value, with the corresponding ``T'', to calculate thetotal percent inactivation. In determining the total percent inactivation,the system may calculate the CT at each point where ``C'' was measuredand compare this with the CT<T2>99.9</T2> value (the CT value necessary to achieve 99.9 percent inactivation)in the rule for specified conditions (pH, temperature, and residual disinfectantconcentration). Each calculated CT value (CTcalc) must be divided by theappropriate CT<T2>99.9</T2> value found in Tables 1.1-3.1 in the rule to determine theinactivation ratio.

This approachis supported by EPA's Science Advisory Board (1988). EPA does not believethat using a T<T2>50</T2> value, which was recommended by many commenters, rather thana T<T2>10</T2> value, would provide an adequate margin of safety since only50 percent of the water, rather than 90 percent, would receive the contacttime necessary to achieve the percent inactivation the CT value represents.(b) <T3>CT values for chlorine.</T3> The CT values in the proposed rule werebased on animal infectivity data (Hibler et al., 1987b) and applicationof a regression model to these data (Clark et al., 1987; Regli, 1987).To provide a margin of safety, the CT values to achieve 99.9 percent inactivationin the proposed rule were set equal to the CT values needed to achieve99.99 percent inactivation under experimental conditions.Many commenters recommended that EPA consider data obtained from disinfectionstudies using <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> (specifically, data developed by Jarroll et al.(1981)) to develop the CT values in the final rule. Commenters indicatedthat CT values based on the Jarroll et al. data would be significantlylower than those in the proposed rule.The CT values in the final rule are based on a statistical analysis (Clarket al., 1988), which considered both animal infectivity studies (Hibleret al., 1987b) and excystation studies (Jarroll et al., 1981; Rice et al.,1982; Rubin, 1988c). A multiplicative model (the one previously developedfor the animal infectivity data alone, which formed the basis for CT valuesin the proposed rule, Clark et al., 1987) was selected to best representthe chemical reactions during the inactivation process. This model wasapplied to each of the data sets described above, and in various combinations(Clark et al., 1988). The animal infectivity data (Hibler et al., 1987b)were included in each of the combinations studied. The animal infectivitydata were considered essential for inclusion in all the combined data setsbecause, unlike the other data sets, these data represented inactivationlevels greater than 99.9 percent. Because of limitations with the excystationmethodology, only data on conditions necessary for achieving less than99.9 percent inactivation were available from these studies. Data at theselower inactivation levels were included in the analysis since the CT valuesin the rule may be used for calculating partial inactivation levels (i.e.,less than 99.9 percent) which, in total, are considered in determiningwhether the overall minimum level of inactivation of 99.9 percent is met.Statistical analysis indicated that combining the Hibler et al. (1987b)and Jarroll et al. (1981) data ( and excluding the Rice et al. (1982) andRubin et al. (1988c) data formed the best fit model for predicting CT valuesfor different levels of inactivation. As a conservative regulatory strategy,Clark et al. (1988) recommended that CT values for different levels ofinactivation be determined by applying first order kinetics to the 99 percentupper confidence interval of the CT<T2>99.99</T2> values predicted by the model. For CT values above 5 anddegrees;C,where data were limited, the authors recommended that for every increaseof 10 anddegrees;C, the CT value be lowered by one half. This concept, whichwas applied for determining the CT values in the proposed rule, is alsosupported by Hoff (1986).Accordingly, the best fit model (based on the Hibler et al. (1987b) andJarroll et al. (1981) data) was applied, using the above two concepts,to determine the CT<T2>99.9</T2> values in the final rule. The CT<T2>99.9</T2> values in the final rule are between zero and 10 percentlower than what was proposed.(c) <T3>CT values for ozone.</T3> The CT values for ozone in the proposed rulewere based on disinfection studies using <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> (Wickramanayake <T3>et al.</T3>, 1985). CT<T2>99</T2> values at 5 anddegrees;C and pH 7 for ozone ranged from 0.46to 0.64. No data on CT values were available for other pHs at 5 anddegrees;C.Therefore, to obtain these data, the highest CT<T2>99</T2> value, 0.64, was extrapolated using first order kinetics andmultiplied by a safety factor of 3 to obtain the other CT<T2>99.9</T2> values in the proposed rule, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">CT<T2>99.9</T2>=0.64andmultiply;3andmultiply;3/2=2.9</ITAG>CT values at temperatures above 5 anddegrees;C were estimated using the samemultiplier assumed for free chlorine, as discussed above. CT values at1 anddegrees;C or lower, for which no data were available, were estimatedby multiplying the CT<T2>99.9</T2> value at 5 anddegrees;C by 1.5.A much larger safety factor was applied to the CT values for ozone thanwas used to determine the proposed CT values for chlorine because:andbullet; Fewer data were available for ozone than for chlorine.andbullet; The data available for ozone, because of the limitations of theexcystation procedure, only reflect up to or slightly more than 99 percentinactivation, while the data for chlorine was based on animal infectivitystudies indicating inactivation at 99.99 percent (Hibler et al., 1987b;Clark et al., 1988). Thus, extrapolation of data to determine CT valuesfor 99.9 percent inactivation using ozone involved greater uncertaintythan the determination of CT values for 99.9 percent inactivation usingchlorine.andbullet; The determination of CT at the water treatment plant also involvesgreater uncertainty for ozone than for chlorine because contact time andresidual concentration cannot be monitored as precisely for ozone.andbullet; EPA believed that the proposed CT values, even with a large safetyfactor, would be practical to achieve.EPA applied a safety factor of two instead of three to the laboratory datato obtain the CT values in the final rule, i.e., the CT values for ozonein the final rule are two-thirds of those in the proposed rule, because:andbullet; The laboratory data which formed the basis for the CT values usedthe Iodometric method for measuring ozone. The Iodometric method measurestotal oxidants present, not just ozone alone (e.g., this method measuresozonation by-products such as hydrogen peroxide, which is a much weakerdisinfectant than ozone). The final rule requires systems to measure ozoneusing the Indigo method; this method measures ozone but not other oxidants.At the time of these experiments, the Iodometric method was the only prescribedmethod for measuring ozone in Standard Methods (16th edition, 1985). Inthe forthcoming l7th edition of Standard Methods, however, the Indigo method,rather than the Iodometric method, will be the recommended method for measuringozone. Since the original CT values were based on a ``C'' which may haveincluded the measurement of other oxidants in addition to ozone, the CTvalues from these experiments are conservative, i.e., they are probablysomewhat higher than if ozone had been measured using the Indigo method.andbullet; According to public comments received and further analysis bythe Agency, the proposed CT values for ozone in the proposed rule couldonly be achieved at very high costs.Depending upon source water characteristics, EPA believes that it willbe feasible for many systems to use ozone to meet the revised CT values,and that these values provide an adequate margin of safety.(d) <T3>CT values for chlorine dioxide.</T3> The CT values for chlorine dioxidein the proposed rule were based on disinfection studies using <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation of<T3> Giardia muris</T3> cysts (Leahy, 1985). CT<T2>99</T2> values at 5 anddegrees;C and pH 7 ranged from 7 to 18. The highestCT<T2>99</T2> value, 18, was used as the basis for extrapolation, using thesame principles as discussed for ozone, to obtain the CT<T2>99.9</T2> values in the proposed rule.Limited data (i.e., at 25 anddegrees;C only) indicate that chlorine dioxideis more effective for inactivating <T3>Giardia muris </T3>cysts at pH 9 than at pH 7 (Leahy, 1985). Becausethe data are limited, however, EPA proposed the same CT values for allother pHs.Since the proposal, more data on the conditions necessary for achieving99 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts, using <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation, has become available at 1 anddegrees;C, 5anddegrees;C, and 15 anddegrees;C (Rubin, 1988b). These new data, plus thedata used to develop the CT values in the proposal, were used to developthe CT values in the final rule. The average CT<T2>99</T2> value at each temperature (27.9 at 1 anddegrees;C, 11.8 at 5anddegrees;C, 8.5 at 15 anddegrees;C, and 4.7 at 25 anddegrees;C) was extrapolatedusing first order kinetics and multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5 toobtain the CT<T2>99.9</T2> values. Thus CT<T2>99.9</T2> at 1 anddegrees;C=27.9andmultiply;1.5andmultiply;1.5=63. Becauseof the limited data available at different pHs, the same CT values arespecified for all pHs. Although most of the CT<T2>99</T2> data were determined at pH 7, it is known that chlorine dioxideis more effective at pH 9. Thus, the CT values in the rule are more conservativefor higher pHs than for lower pHs. The CT values for chlorine dioxide in the final rule are about one-thirdless than those in the proposed rule. EPA believes the revised CT valuesin the rule provide an adequate margin of safety because of the additionaldata that was used, and because <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts, rather than <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts (which is the organism of concern in publicwater systems), were used in the laboratory experiments. Since <T3>Giardia muris</T3> appears to be more resistant than <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> to chlorine (Leahy et al., 1987) and ozone (Wickramanayakeet al., 1985), it is reasonable to assume it is more resistant to chlorinedioxide as well. (e) <T3>CT values for chloramines_</T3>(1) <T3>Inactivation of Giardia cysts.</T3> The CT values for chloramines,based on disinfection studies using preformed chloramines and <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation of <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts (Rubin, 1988a; Regli, 1987), are the samein the proposed and final rules. No safety factor was applied to the laboratorydata on which the CT values were based since EPA believes that chloramination,conducted in the field, is more effective than using preformed chloramines.In the draft Guidance Manual, EPA stated that animal infectivity studiescould be used to determine the CT values necessary to achieve 99.9 percentinactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. EPA believes that other methodologies also maybe appropriate. Therefore, in the final Guidance Manual, EPA will recommendthat States also allow systems to use the methodology based on <T3>in vitro</T3> excystation discussed by Hoff et al., 1985, and morespecifically, to determine CT values for achieving greater than or equalto 99.9 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts using chloramines. In addition, EPA will recommendin the final Guidance Manual that <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts be used as a model for <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts when conducting excystation studies because,as noted earlier, disinfection studies using excystation to measure viabilityindicate that <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts are more resistant to inactivation than <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and thus provide a conservative estimateof disinfection effectiveness (Hoff, 1985); also, <T3>Giardia muris</T3> cysts are apparently not pathogenic to humans, andare thus safer to work with. (2) <T3>Inactivation of viruses.</T3> Under the proposed rule, if a systemused chlorine, ozone, or chlorine dioxide and achieved 99.9 percent inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts (i.e., they achieved the CT values in the rule),it was assumed that it would also achieve greater than 99.99 percent inactivationof viruses. However, the proposal explained that if a system used chloraminesand was able to achieve the CT values for 99.9 percent inactivation of<T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, it could not be assumed that 99.99 percent or greaterinactivation of viruses was also achieved. No minimum CT values for achieving 99.99 percent inactivation of viruseswere included in the proposed rule. Instead, under the proposal, systemsusing chloramines for primary disinfection would be required to conducton-site challenge studies to demonstrate that they achieved at least 99.99percent inactivation of viruses. Since the proposal, new data have become available which indicate thatHepatitis A virus is more sensitive than <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts to inactivation by preformed chloramines (Sobsey,1988). Thus, the CT values required to achieve 99.99 percent inactivationof Hepatitis A with preformed chloramines are lower than those needed toachieve 99.9 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. These data contrast with other data which indicatethat rotavirus is more resistant than <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts to preformed chloramines (Hoff, 1986). However,rotavirus is very sensitive to inactivation by free chlorine, much moreso than Hepatitis A (Hoff, 1986; Sobsey, 1988). If chlorine is appliedprior to ammonia, the short-term presence of free chlorine would be expectedto provide at least 99.99 percent inactivation of rotavirus prior to theaddition of ammonia and subsequent formation of chloramines. Thus, EPAbelieves it is appropriate to use the Hepatitis A data, in lieu of therotavirus data, as a surrogate for determining minimum CT values for inactivationof viruses by chloramines, provided that chlorine is added to the waterprior to the addition of ammonia. Thus, under the final rule, a system which achieves a 99.9 percent or greaterinactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts with chloramines is considered to be achieving atleast 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses, provided that chlorine isadded to the water prior to the addition of ammonia. If ammonia is addedfirst, the CT values in the rule for achieving 99.9 percent inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts cannot be considered adequate for achieving 99.99percent inactivation of viruses. Thus, under the final rule, like the proposal,such systems must demonstrate, based on on-site challenge studies, thatthe system is achieving at least a 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses.Guidance for conducting such studies will be provided in the final GuidanceManual. The proposed rule included a provision that excluded systems with no sourcesof human viruses within the watershed from the 99.99 percent virus inactivationrequirement. This provision was based on the fact that there were no dataavailable to indicate that viruses excreted by animals are pathogenic tohumans. However, one commenter cited a study by Markwell and Shortridge(1981) indicating that a cycle of waterborne transmission and maintenanceof influenza virus may exist within duck communities in southern China,and that it is conceivable that virus transmission could occur in thismanner to other susceptible animals, including humans. Based on the resultsof this study, the exclusion in the proposal has been removed. Thus, thefinal rule requires that all systems, even if there is no human activitywithin the watershed, achieve the minimum inactivation requirements forviruses. (f) <T3>Alternative means for demonstrating adequate disinfection.</T3> Inthe May 6, 1988, notice of availability, EPA explained why CT values wereincluded in the proposed rule for unfiltered supplies but not for filteredsupplies (52 FR 16357). EPA solicited comments on whether this rationalewas reasonable. Specifically, EPA asked whether CT values for unfilteredsystems should be placed in guidance rather than in the rule.Most commenters thought that all CT values should be placed in guidancerather than in the rule to more easily allow for changes in CT values basedupon new data, and to allow States flexibility in their application. EPA has retained the CT values for unfiltered systems in the final rulebecause (a) the inclusion of CT values for unfiltered systems makes therule ``self-implementing'' and directly enforceable, i.e., a system thatdoes not meet the CT values must install filtration, regardless of whetherthe State has determined whether filtration is required for a given system(see the section entitled ``Compliance,'' below); (b) in general, unfilteredsupplies are at much greater risk to waterborne disease than are filteredsupplies (from 1971 through 1985, reported waterborne disease outbreaksand illnesses were 8 and 15 times higher, respectively, in unfiltered supplieswith disinfection than in filtered supplies with disinfection), so it isimportant to have self-implementing, directly enforceable requirementsin the rule for such systems; (c) without CT values in the rule for unfilteredsupplies, there would be no self-implementing, directly enforceable provisionto ensure an adequate level of disinfection is provided (in contrast, filteredsystems have self-implementing, directly enforceable turbidity performancecriteria that indicate, at least in part, the efficiency of <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst and virus removal); and (d) for free chlorine, whichis by far the most widely used disinfectant, especially for unfilteredsupplies, EPA does not believe new data will soon become available to providea basis for concluding that lower CT values that will achieve the requiredlevels of <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst and virus inactivation. However, EPA agrees with commenters that the CT values for chlorine dioxide,ozone, and chloramines in the final rule are based on limited data comparedto the more extensive data that provide the basis for the chlorine CT valuesand that, for these disinfectants, new data are more likely to become availablein the near future that may support different CT values or other meansfor determining what percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and viruses a disinfectant achieves. For example,pilot plant studies may show that the disinfection efficiency of ozone,because of its rapid rate of dissipation, may be better characterized byoperational parameters other than CT. Also, a combination of ozone withultraviolet light may be shown to be more effective than ozone alone inachieving the required inactivation efficiencies. As another example, forchloramines, use of on-site formation rather than preformed chloraminesmay prove to be significantly more efficient than the laboratory conditionsin place during the studies that are the basis for the CT values in thisrule, in which case, lower CT values may be appropriate (Hoff, 1986). Recognizing that research in this field is ongoing, EPA has included aprovision in the final rule which allows an unfiltered system using a disinfectantother than chlorine (i.e., chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide) todemonstrate, by whatever means allowed by the State, that it is consistentlymeeting the 99.9 and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation requirementson a daily basis, instead of meeting the CT values in the rule. This methodneed not include use of CT values. For example, the efficiency of ozonation,under which disinfection occurs very rapidly, may best be indicated bydifferent operational conditions (e.g., applied dosage and energy mixingefficiencies) in place of, or in addition to, CT values. This provisionis not provided for systems using only chlorine because: (1) A large database was used for deriving the CT values in the rule and EPA believes thatnew data are unlikely to become available soon to support the basis forother CT values; and (2) the laboratory experiments on which the CT valuesare based more closely simulate field conditions for chlorine than theydo for chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Filtered Systems </ITAG>EPA proposed that filtered systems disinfect their water, and that theoverall treatment (i.e., filtration and disinfection) achieve at least99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation and 99.99 percent removal and/orinactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses, respectively. The State woulddetermine whether the system complied with this treatment performance requirement.In the draft Guidance Manual, EPA recommended that, in general, filtration(with any pretreatment appropriate for the specific technology used) shouldbe assumed to achieve 99 percent (2-log) to 99.9 (3-log) removal of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and 90 percent (1-log) to 99.9 percent (3-log)removal of viruses. Using this assumption, EPA recommended that, to achieveat least 99.9 percent and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of<T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses, respectively, with considerablemargin of safety, a system that filters should provide disinfection whichachieves at least a 90 percent (1-log) inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and a 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivationof viruses (higher levels of inactivation were recommended for systemswith source waters having significant fecal contamination). For most systems,i.e., those which use chlorine, CT values which achieve greater than a90 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts can be expected to achieve greater thana 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses. Thus, a system which uses chlorineand achieves greater than 90 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts would be assumed to satisfy the overallminimum performance requirement for viruses.Most of the comments on CT values and the method of their calculation pertainingto unfiltered supplies also pertain to filtered supplies. Thus, most commentersthought that EPA's recommended procedures for calculating CT and the actualCT values in the draft Guidance Manual were overly conservative. Accordingto a survey conducted by the American Water Works Association (AWWA, 1987),only 18 percent of the filtered systems participating in the survey wouldbe able to comply year-round with the CT values recommended in the draftGuidance Manual, when calculated as recommended. Many commenters thoughtthat systems should get credit for inactivation of<T3> Giardia</T3> and viruses with disinfection prior to filtration, regardlessof the level of turbidity (rather than limiting such credit to systemswith low turbidity), because these organisms are contained within particulatematter, and therefore are subsequently removed by either sedimentationor filtration. Some commenters thought that States should have broad discretionin how they apply the CT values in the Guidance Manual for evaluating percentinactivations for filtered supplies until the numbers are field testedand evaluated on the basis of actual experience. In contrast, however,other commenters stated that, for filtered systems, EPA should establishminimum disinfection performance standards, in the form of minimum CT values,in the rule (rather than simply making recommendations in the GuidanceManual) in order to assure uniform nationwide standards.From 1971 through 1985, there were three reported waterborne disease outbreaksin filtered systems attributed to inadequate or interrupted disinfectionversus 10 outbreaks due to inadequte filtration or pretreatment (in contrastto unfiltered supplies where there were 42 reported outbreaks due to inadequateor interrupted disinfection) (Craun, 1988). Although EPA strongly believesthese statistics reflect only a small proportion of the disease outbreaksand illnesses actually occurring, EPA also believes that these data indicate,in general, that most filtered systems, when well-operated, are providingadequate levels of disinfection to protect from waterborne disease. Basedon a review of these data and public comments, EPA has concluded that themany safety factors that it recommended in the draft Guidance Manual forestimating the total removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and viruses in filtered systems, like the safetyfactors built into the requirements for unfiltered systems were, in total,overly conservative.In response, the following changes will be made in the final Guidance Manualto address these concerns:andbullet; In the draft Guidance Manual, EPA had recommended that credittoward <T3>Giardia</T3> and virus inactivation in the water prior to filtrationbe allowed only if the turbidity of that water is less than 5 and 1 NTU,respectively. The final Guidance Manual will recommend that credit be givenfor disinfection of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and viruses prior to filtration regardless of theturbidity level. This recommendation is based on the assumption that anypathogens present in the source water will be either removed by filtrationor directly exposed to disinfection.andbullet; The final Guidance Manual will recommend that, in general, systemsusing conventional treatment which are able to achieve turbidity levelsof less than 0.5 NTU in the filtered water in 95 percent of the samplesbe assumed to achieve 2.5-log removal of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and 2-log inactivation of viruses, provided thatcoagulation and flocculation conditions are optimized for turbidity removalby filtration. These systems would thus only need to achieve a 0.5-loginactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and a 2-log inactivation of viruses withdisinfection to satisfy the overall 3-log and 4-log minimum performancerequirements. EPA believes that these revisions are appropriate since sedimentationand filtration (preceded by coagulation) provide more removal of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and viruses than does filtration (preceded by coagulation)alone. This conclusion is based on two recent studies. In pilot plant studiesusing Ohio River water, Logsdon (1985) has shown that sedimentation achieves0.5- to 1-log removal of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. Since filtration provides 2-log removal, it isappropriate to assume that sedimentation and filtration together provideat least 2.5-log removal. In addition, in pilot plant studies using LakeHouston water, Rao et al. (1988) have shown that sedimentation (precededby coagulation) achieves generally greater than 90 percent removal of virusesand that sedimentation and filtration together generally achieve greaterthan 99 percent removal of viruses.andbullet; The CT values for free chlorine have been lowered up to 10 percent,for the same reasons discussed above for unfiltered supplies.andbullet; The CT values for ozone and chlorine dioxide have been loweredby about one-third, for the same reasons discussed above for unfilteredsupplies.andbullet; Regarding the use of chloramines, the final Guidance Manual willrecommend that, in general, for the reasons discussed above for unfilteredsystems, filtered systems which add chlorine to the water prior to ammoniaaddition be assumed to be achieving 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivationof viruses if they are achieving 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts. This is a change from the draft GuidanceManual which recommended that all systems using chloramines for primarydisinfection demonstrate the adequacy of virus inactivation based on on-sitechallenge studies. For systems which add ammonia to the water prior tochlorine, the final Guidance Manual will continue to recommend on-sitechallenge studies to determine the adequacy of disinfection for virus inactivation.Figures III.1 and III.2 indicate the levels of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cyst inactivation that filtered systems in theU.S. are currently achieving from disinfection alone, assuming the criteriain the final rule and final Guidance Manual for calculating percent inactivationwere implemented. EPA estimates that 10 to 20 percent of filtered systemswill need to augment existing disinfection in order to comply with thisfinal rule and to meet the criteria recommended in the final Guidance Manual.This is a large reduction from AWWA's estimates that 82 percent of filteredsystems would need to enhance their current disinfection practice to meetthe criteria in the proposed rule and the draft Guidance Manual (AWWA,1987). H. Potential Conflict Between Today's Rule and Future Rules for Disinfectantsand Disinfection By-Products EPA intends to promulgate national primary drinking water regulations toregulate levels of disinfectants and disinfectant by-products for all systemswhen it promulgates disinfection requirements for groundwater systems.Many commenters expressed concern that changes that systems might needto make in their disinfection practice in order to comply with today'sfinal rule might be inconsistent with the treatment changes necessary tocomply with these forthcoming regulations for disinfectants and disinfectionby-products. EPA believes that many of the specific concerns expressed by commentershave been substantially mitigated by the changes in the final rule andplanned changes in the final Guidance Manual discussed previously. As aresult of these changes, EPA believes that many systems already are incompliance with today's rule, so changes in disinfection practice willnot be necessary. In addition, under the final rule, the State has discretionto determine what disinfection conditions are needed for filtered systemsto meet the 3- and 4-log removal and/or inactivation requirements for <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses (or any higher level of performancethat might be specified by the State, depending upon source water qualityconditions). In exercising this discretion, the State could take into accountany potential conflict with forthcoming regulations for disinfectants anddisinfection by-products. For example, if a system using conventional treatmentis well-designed and is optimizing its clarification processes for turbidityremoval, and is achieving very low filtered water turbidities, it may beappropriate for the State to give that system 3 logs of credit for <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst removal (in lieu of the generally recommended 2.5-logcredit); in this way, the system can avoid substantial (if any) upgradesin disinfection practice and, in turn, potential increases in health risksfrom higher levels of disinfection by-products. In the final Guidance Manual,EPA expects to recommend that States give credit for 3 logs of <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst removal by conventional treatment only if: (a) Thetotal treatment train achieves at least 99 percent turbidity removal, orfiltered water turbidities are consistently less than 0.5 NTU, whicheverresults in lower levels; and (b) the level of HPC in the finished (disinfected)water entering the distribution system is consistently less than 10/ml.In general, EPA believes that filtered systems need to achieve 0.5- to1-log inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts (depending on the type of filtration used)to achieve an overall 3-log removal and/or inactivation. However, it maybe appropriate to allow more credit for filtration and thus require lessdisinfection, e.g., less than 0.5 logs for conventional treatment, untilregulations for disinfectants and disinfection by-products are promulgatedand the optimum treatment for achieving compliance with both regulationscan be determined. However, EPA recommends that these lower levels of disinfectiononly be allowed if the source water is expected to have concentrationsof less than one <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst/100 l. Likewise, for systems using slow sand filtrationand diatomaceous earth filtration, EPA believes it would not be unreasonablefor States to allow 2.5 or 3 logs of credit for <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst removal in lieu of the generally recommended guidelineof 2 logs of credit, depending upon source water quality and concerns aboutdisinfection by-products. Pilot plant studies have demonstrated (USEPA,1988b) that these technologies, when well-operated, generally achieve theseremovals or better. Assuming these technologies achieve only a 2-log removal,as generally recommended by EPA for the purpose of determining the appropriatelevel of disinfection necessary for the system to meet the overall treatmentperformance standard, provides a very conservative margin of safety tocontrol for microbiological concerns. However, EPA recognizes this assumptionmay not always be appropriate depending upon source water quality, reliabilityof system operation, and potential increased health risks from disinfectionby-products. Thus, the final rule does not dictate how the State must calculatetreatment efficiencies for filtered systems; it is left to State discretion.In the final Guidance Manual EPA plans to recommend that States allow,for the interim (i.e., between now and the time EPA promulgates regulationsfor disinfectants and disinfection by-products), more credit for <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst removal (and, in turn, virus removal) only if itdetermines that a system is not currently at significant risk from microbiologicalconcerns at the existing level of disinfection, and that a deferral isnecessary for the system to upgrade its disinfection process to achievecompliance with this rule as well as the forthcoming regulations for disinfectantsand disinfection by-products. Since EPA intends to regulate disinfectantsand disinfection by-products by 1991 (<T3>see </T3>53 FR 1899), and compliance with today's final rule for filteredsystems is not required until June 1993, it is anticipated that most ofsuch systems will have sufficient time to optimally address the requirementsof both rules. EPA does not believe that the same discretion discussed above for filteredsystems is appropriate for unfiltered systems since (a) they are at muchgreater risk from waterborne disease than are filtered systems, (b) SDWArequires that the State determine whether filtration is required within30 months following the promulgation of this rule, and the State cannotmake the decision whether filtration is necessary without knowing whatdisinfection will be in place. Also, the installation of filtration byan unfiltered supply allows a system to use much lower levels of disinfectionthan is necessary in a system without filtration; as a result, levels ofdisinfectants and disinfectant by-products are lower in filtered systems,assuming the same source water quality conditions.I. Turbidity Monitoring and Performance Criteria<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Unfiltered Systems </ITAG>EPA proposed that, to avoid filtration, a system demonstrate on an ongoingbasis that the turbidity of the water prior to disinfection does not exceed5 NTU, based on measurements at least every four hours. Under the proposal,a system would not be required to filter if it occasionally exceeded the5 NTU limit (although such an exceedance would be considered a violationof the treatment technique requirements which posed an acute risk to humanhealth). Specifically, a system could exceed the 5 NTU limit no more thantwo periods during twelve consecutive months or five periods during 120consecutive months, provided that (a) the system informed its customersand the State of the violation, as soon as possible but in no case laterthan 72 hours after the violation occurred, and customers were instructedto boil their water before consumption until it was determined that thewater was safe, and (b) the State determined that the exceedance occurredbecause of unusual or unpredictable circumstances. A ``period'' would bedefined as a series of consecutive days in which at least one turbiditymeasurement each day exceeded 5 NTU. Some commenters were opposed to allowing any periods when turbidities exceeded5 NTU since systems are most vulnerable to microbiological risk at suchtimes. Others thought that the periods in which turbidity could exceed5 NTU should be limited in duration. Some commenters stated that an absolutelimit for turbidity was inappropriate since the significance of turbiditylevels as an indicator of possible interference with disinfection dependson the size and chemical composition of the particulate matter present.Other commenters supported the proposed turbidity limits. Some commentersopposed the proposal to classify an exceedance of 5 NTU as an acute healthrisk since high turbidity does not necessarily indicate a health hazard,depending on the nature of the particulate matter present. Similarly, theyobjected to the proposal that systems issue a boil water notice to thepublic whenever the turbidity exceeded 5 NTU; many thought that such arequirement should be left to State discretion based upon an evaluationof actual health risk. In the final rule, EPA has retained the provision that allows unfilteredsystems to exceed the turbidity limit of 5 NTU a limited number of times,i.e., no more than two events during 12 consecutive months or five eventsduring 120 consecutive months, as long as the State is informed of eachexceedance and determines that it was caused by unusual or unpredictablecircumstances. (In the final rule, EPA uses the term ``event'' rather than``period.'') EPA believes that the other requirements for avoiding filtrationin the rule ensure a high probability that adequate treatment is stillbeing provided if the turbidity were to exceed 5 NTU for short periodsof time. These include the requirements to (a) comply with fecal or totalcoliform source water quality limits; (b) maintain disinfection conditionssufficient to achieve at least 99.9 and 99.99 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses, respectively, as indicatedby meeting the CT requirements; (c) comply with the total coliform MCL(the coliform rule, published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, requires unfiltered surface waters to take coliformmeasurements at or near the first customer on days when the turbidity exceeds1 NTU and to include these measurements in the MCL compliance determination);and (d) maintain a watershed control program to restrict human activities.The requirement to have a watershed control program reduces the probabilitythat human viruses will be present in large numbers, so there is less concernabout turbidity interfering with disinfection of viruses. In addition,there is much less concern about turbidity interfering with inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts by disinfection than viruses or bacteria since <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts are much larger than viruses and bacteria and areless likely to be occluded or protected by particulate matter. The final rule does not specify a maximum duration for a turbidity event,as a condition for avoiding filtration, since other requirements (discussedabove) must also be met to avoid filtration; EPA expects that, if the durationof an event is long, and the system is at risk (which will depend on thenature of the particulate matter causing the high turbidity level, andthe source water quality), one of the other requirements for avoiding filtrationis likely to be exceeded, thereby requiring the system to install filtration.EPA agrees with public commenters who stated that interference with disinfectionby turbidity will depend on the nature of the particulate matter that ispresent. However, as discussed in the proposal, EPA believes an upper limitof 5 NTU is appropriate. Increases in turbidity occurrence levels fromless than 1 NTU to greater than 5-10 NTUs have been shown to correlatewith decreases in disinfection effectiveness in unfiltered source waters(Le Chevalier et al., 1981). In addition, high turbidity waters may beunaesthetic in appearance and cause consumers to avoid use of the publicwater supply and possibly choose less safe waters. The requirement that systems inform their customers to boil their waterbefore consumption when source water turbidities exceed 5 NTU has beendeleted from the final rule. EPA agrees with the commenters that Statesshould determine if such an order should be issued, since certain site-specificfactors might not warrant such action. Also, in the final rule, an exceedanceof the turbidity limit of 5 NTU is considered a violation of a treatmenttechnique requirement, but not, as proposed, one which poses an acute riskto human health. Therefore, violation of the 5 NTU limit does not requirea system to notify the public via electronic media, posting, or hand delivery,depending on system type, within 72 hours. (Only written notice is required,as specified for Tier 1 violations. <T3>See</T3> the public notification regulations at 40 CFR 141.32.)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Filtered Systems</ITAG>EPA proposed to require systems that filter to measure the turbidity levelof a representative sample of filtered water every four hours when wateris being delivered to the distribution system. For a system using conventionaltreatment or direct filtration, EPA proposed to require that the turbiditylevel of the system's filtered water be less than or equal to 0.5 NTU inat least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month. For a systemusing slow sand or diatomaceous earth filtration, EPA proposed to requirethat the turbidity level be less than 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of themeasurements taken each month. Under the proposal, for systems using conventionaltreatment or direct filtration, if the State determined that on-site studiesdemonstrated at least 99.9 percent overall removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, the State could specify a higher turbidity limit,up to 1 NTU in 95 percent of the samples in a month.Many commenters, especially those representing small systems, favored retainingthe current turbidity monitoring requirements in the interim regulations,i.e., one sample per day (40 CFR 141.22). Commenters claimed that monitoringof turbidity every four hours, or by continuous monitoring and recordingequipment, is not feasible for small systems. In addition, many commentersobjected to the 0.5 NTU limit for systems using conventional treatmentor direct filtration; they favored retaining the existing standard of 1NTU. Some commenters stated there is no evidence that the more stringentturbidity criteria EPA proposed would result in increased health protection,i.e., fewer waterborne disease outbreaks, compared to the existing turbidityMCL. Commenters stated that many systems, especially smaller systems, wouldincur significant costs to make treatment changes to comply with the proposedturbidity criteria. In a survey by AWWA (1987), which sampled mostly largesystems, 24 percent of the filtered systems which responded did not havefiltered water with turbidity less than 0.5 NTU 95 percent of the time.Some commenters supported the 0.5 NTU limit, claiming it would significantlyimprove the quality of drinking water nationwide. Other commenters supportedthe 0.5 NTU limit but only for large systems; they suggested EPA promulgatea separate limit of 1 NTU for small systems. Still other commenters favoredthe 0.5 NTU limit but thought the rule should allow the State to increasethe limit if there was evidence of effective removal of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts or <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst-sized particles at higher turbidities.In response to these comments, EPA requested comment on alternatives tothe proposed turbidity provisions in the May 6, 1988, notice of availability(53 FR 16354). Most commenters responding to this issue supported thesechanges. As a result, many have been included in the final rule. Thesechanges are described below.The final rule allows the State to reduce the monitoring frequency forturbidity to one grab sample per day for systems serving 500 or fewer peopleif the State finds that the historical performance and operation of thesystem indicates effective particulate removal under the variety of conditionsexpected to occur in that system. EPA believes this provision for reducedmonitoring is appropriate because, for very small systems, grab samplemonitoring every four hours of operation may not be feasible (i.e., itis economically infeasible to provide the degree of operator attentionnecessary to conduct such monitoring; likewise, it is costly to installand impractical to maintain automated turbidity monitoring equipment).At the reduced monitoring frequency, the same performance criteria wouldapply. Thus, for instance, if two or more of the 30 samples taken in onemonth exceed the turbidity limit, then less than 95 percent of the sampleswould meet the turbidity performance criterion, and the system would bein violation of a treatment technique requirement.EPA believes that it is feasible for most systems using conventional treatmentor direct filtration to achieve the turbidity performance criterion of0.5 NTU (see 52 FR 42200, 42205-42206). EPA believes it is generally necessaryfor systems using conventional treatment or direct filtration to meet thisturbidity limit to achieve at least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts with filtration and disinfection. EPA recognizesthat many existing filtered systems currently may not be meeting the proposedturbidity limit; however, EPA believes that most of these systems can meetthese limits with treatment modifications that involve very low costs (<T3>see</T3> Table VI-3).EPA recognizes that it may be possible for some systems that currentlyare not meeting the turbidity performance criterion, depending upon rawwater quality and other treatment characteristics, to still achieve theoverall minimum (or better) removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts. Therefore, the final rule allows a system to operateat higher filtered turbidities, up to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of themeasurements, if the State determines that the system is achieving theminimum performance requirement of 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts at the higher turbidity level. Unlike the proposal,the final rule does not require the system to actually demonstrate (e.g.,with pilot plant study results) it is achieving the minimum performancerequirements at the higher turbidity level to be allowed to operate atthis level. Instead, the State's determination may be based upon an analysisof existing design and operating conditions (e.g., adequacy of treatmentprior to filtration, percent turbidity removal across the entire treatmenttrain, stringency of disinfection) and/or performance relative to certainwater quality characteristics (e.g., microbiological analysis of the filteredwater, particle size counts in water before and after filtration). TheState may wish to consider such factors as source water quality and systemsize in determining the extent of analysis necessary. The final GuidanceManual will provide additional guidance to the States for determining whena higher turbidity limit might be appropriate.For any filtration technology, EPA believes that filtered water turbiditiesshould generally be less than 1 NTU in order to prevent interference withdisinfection of viruses. Allowing an average turbidity of less than 1 NTU,as some commenters suggested, would allow systems to exceed 1 NTU a highpercentage of the time, during which time there might be interference withdisinfection. Therefore, EPA has set an upper limit for turbidity of 1NTU in 95 percent of the measurements, rather than specifying an average.As in the proposal, exceptions to this limit are allowed for slow sandfiltration, up to 5 NTU, but at no time exceeding 5 NTU, if the systemdemonstrates to the State that there is no interference with disinfection,because studies demonstrate that slow sand filters can achieve greaterthan 99.9 percent removal of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts by filtration alone at turbidities exceeding 1 NTU(Bellamy et al., 1985a, b).The additional flexibility in the final rule will allow States to applyengineering judgment, as appropriate, to determine what information isnecessary for demonstrating adequate treatment performance. EPA anticipatesthat this added flexibility will reduce costs, especially for small systems,while still ensuring that adequate treatment is in place.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Description of the Final Rule </ITAG>EPA believes that all surface waters and ground water under the directinfluence of surface water are at risk, at least to some degree, from contaminationby <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>and other protozoa, viruses, and pathogenic bacteriaand that public water systems using such source waters should provide minimumlevels of treatment to ensure protection from illness caused by these contaminants.Therefore, this rule applies to all public water systems (both communityand non-community) which use a surface water source or a ground water sourceunder the direct influence of surface water. This rule defines ``surface water'' as all water open to the atmosphereand subject to surface runoff (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs,impoundments). This rule defines ``ground water under the direct influenceof surface water'' as:<ITAG tagnum="20">any water beneath the surface of the ground with (i) significant occurrenceof insects or other macroorganisms, algae, or large-diameter pathogenssuch as </ITAG><T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, or (ii) significant and relatively rapid shiftsin water characteristics such as turbidity, temperature, conductivity,or pH which closely correlate to climatological or surface water conditions.Direct influence must be determined for each individual source in accordancewith criteria established by the State. The State determination of directinfluence may be based on site-specific measurements of water quality and/ordocumentation of well construction characteristics and geology with fieldevaluation.The State is responsible for determining whether a system uses ground waterunder the direct influence of surface water and is, therefore, subjectto the requirements of this rule. Determinations of whether a ground watersystem is under the direct influence of surface water must be made within5 years following the promulgation date of this rule for community watersupplies and within 10 years following the promulgation date of this rulefor non-community water systems. Procedures that may be used for determiningwhether there is direct influence by surface water will be included inthe final Guidance Manual. States may choose to apply general guidelinesbased on source characteristics to expedite the determination for easilycharacterized sources, and to apply more specific criteria, including microbiologicalanalysis, for sources more difficult to characterize. For systems whichuse mixed source water supplies (i.e., ground water not under the directinfluence of surface water and surface water), this rule applies only tothe water originating from the surface water source. A. Operator Personnel Requirements Under the final rule, all systems using surface water or ground water underthe direct influence of surface water must be operated by personnel thatmeet qualifications specified by the State. As described later, Statesmust develop operator qualifications if they do not already have them andrequire that systems be operated by personnel who meet these qualifications.The appropriate criteria for determining if an operator is qualified dependupon the type and size of the system. EPA encourages States which do notyet have operator license certification programs in effect to develop suchprograms. B. Treatment Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary </ITAG>Under this rule, all community and non-community public water systems usingany surface water source must treat their surface water source(s) to achieveat least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts, and at least 99.99 percent removal and/orinactivation of viruses. A system is deemed to be in compliance with thisrequirement if it complies with the treatment technique requirements specifiedin this rule. At a minimum, the treatment required for any surface watermust include disinfection. Thus, systems with very clean and protected source waters that meet thesource water quality criteria (including low total coliform or fecal coliformlevels and low turbidity levels, as specified in the rule) and certainsite-specific criteria (including an effective watershed control program),are required to use only disinfection to achieve 99.9 percent and 99.99percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and viruses, respectively. If such systemscan continually meet the applicable CT values specified in the rule (or,if a disinfectant other than chlorine is used, other criteria specifiedby the State), the system is considered to be in compliance with the requiredremoval and/or inactivation requirements for <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>and viruses without monitoring for these organisms.Systems which cannot meet the source water quality criteria and site-specificcriteria of this rule are required to filter their water. Systems required to filter can use a variety of treatment technologiesto meet the minimum 99.9 and 99.99 percent performance levels. A systemwith filtration that achieves certain turbidity levels and meets specifieddisinfection requirements is deemed to be in compliance with these performancerequirements. For most source waters in the United States, EPA considers conventionaltreatment (which includes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, rapidgranular filtration, and disinfection) to be the best technology for controllingmicrobiological contaminants because of the multiple barriers of protectionthat it provides. Conventional treatment has been demonstrated to achieveat least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivationof viruses under appropriate design and operating conditions (USEPA, 1988b);it is the benchmark against which water treatment decisions should be judged.Direct filtration (which includes coagulation), slow sand filtration, anddiatomaceous earth filtration, each with disinfection, also have been demonstratedto achieve at least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivationof viruses under appropriate design and operating conditions (USEPA, 1988b).Under the final rule, a public water system also may use a filtration technologyother than the four specified above if it demonstrates to the State usingpilot plant challenge studies, or other appropriate means, that the filtrationtechnology, in combination with disinfection, achieves at least 99.9 percentand 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses, respectively. In addition,the State may approve a technology demonstrated to be effective at onesite for use at another site if the source water quality conditions atthe two sites are similar. In determining the appropriate technology to be used, source water quality,site-specific factors (e.g., available land, location of the treatmentplant relative to the water source, waste-disposal concerns), and costeffectiveness need to be considered. In general, the level of treatmentprovided should be commensurate with the potential for pathogen contaminationin the source water. Table IV-1 provides guidelines for selecting filtrationtechnology(ies) to be used based on source water quality. EPA recommendsconducting pilot plant studies to help determine the most appropriate filtrationtechnology and the optimum design conditions. More detailed guidelinesfor determining the appropriate technology and design conditions will beincluded in the final Guidance Manual.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s100,12,xs17,6</C><T4>Table IV-1._Generalized Capability of Filtration Systems to AccommodateVarious Raw Water Quality Conditions</T4><H1>Treatment technology</H1><H1>General constraints (i.e., indicated values occasionally could be exceeded)</H1><H2>Total coliforms (andplusmin;/100 ml)</H2><H2>Turbidity (NTU) \1\</H2><H2>Color (CU) \2\</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Conventional Treatment<D>andless;20,000</D><D>no restrictions</D><D>andless;75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(with no predisinfection)<D>andless;5,000 </D><D>no restrictions</D><D>andless;75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Direct Filtration<D>andless;500</D><D>andless;7-14</D><D>andless;40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Slow Sand Filtration<D>andless;800</D><D>andless;10</D><D>andless;5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diatomaceous Earth Filtration<D>andless;50</D><D>andless;5</D><D>andless;5</D><F>\1\ Nephelometric turbidity units.</F><F>\2\ Colorimetric units.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Criteria for Determining if Filtration Is Required </ITAG>Under the final rule, a public water system using surface water must usefiltration unless it meets the following criteria: <T3>Source Water Quality Criteria</T3>andbullet; Coliformsandbullet; Turbidity<T3>Site-specific Criteria</T3>andbullet; Disinfectionandbullet; Watershed controlandbullet; On-site inspectionandbullet; Absence of waterborne disease outbreaksandbullet; Total coliform maximum contaminant level (MCL)andbullet; Total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) MCLThese criteria are described in detail below.(a) <T3>Source Water Quality Criteria_</T3>(1) <T3>Coliform limits.</T3> To avoid filtration, a system must meet one ofthe following criteria: (1) The fecal coliform concentration in water priorto disinfection is equal to or less than 20/100 ml in at least 90 percentof the samples; or (2) the total coliform concentration in water priorto disinfection is equal to or less than 100/100 ml in at least 90 percentof the samples. If a system monitors for both parameters, it may exceedthe total coliform limit, but not the fecal coliform limit, and still avoidfiltration, while a system that meets the total coliform limit, but notthe fecal coliform limit, must install filtration. Minimum sampling frequenciesfor different system sizes are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,9</C> <H1>Population served</H1><H1>Samples/week \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;500<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">501 to 3,300<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301 to 10,000<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001 to 25,000<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;25,000<D>5</D><F>\1\ Must be taken on separate days.</F></ITAG></ITAG>This sampling must include one measurement on every day during which theturbidity exceeds 1 NTU (unless the State determines that the system, forlogistical reasons outside  the system's control, cannot have the sampleanalyzed within 30 hours of collection). This sample counts towards thetotal number that must be taken each week. The coliform limits are an ongoing requirement; at the end of each month,the system must evaluate the data collected for the preceding six monthsthe system served water to the public and determine if this source waterquality condition is still being met. If the criterion has not been met,the system must install filtration. (2) <T3>Turbidity limits. </T3>To avoid filtration, the turbidity of the waterprior to disinfection cannot exceed 5 NTU, on an ongoing basis, based ongrab samples collected every four hours (or more frequently) that the systemis in operation. A system may substitute continuous turbidity monitoringfor grab sample monitoring if it validates such measurements for accuracywith grab sample measurements on a regular basis, as specified by the State.If a public water system uses continuous monitoring, it must use turbidityvalues recorded every four hours (or some shorter regular time interval)to determine whether it meets the turbidity limit for raw water. A systemoccasionally may exceed the 5 NTU limit and still avoid filtration as longas (a) the State determines that each event occurred because of unusualor unpredictable circumstances and (b) as a result of this event, therehave not been more than two such events in the past twelve months the systemserved water to the public or more than five such events in the past 120months the system served water to the public. An ``event'' is defined asa series of consecutive days in which at least one turbidity measurementeach day exceeds 5 NTU.  It is important to note that every event, i.e., exceedance of the 5 NTUlimit, regardless of whether the system must filter as a consequence, constitutesa violation of a treatment technique requirement. For example, if the turbidityexceeded 5 NTU in at least one measurement each day for three consecutivedays, this would constitute one event and one treatment technique violation.If this was the third event in the past 12 months the system served waterto the public, or the sixth event in the past 120 months the system hadserved water to the public, the system also would be required to installfiltration. In all cases, the system must inform the State when the turbidityexceeds 5 NTU as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the nextbusiness day. (b) <T3>Site-Specific Criteria_</T3>(1) <T3>Disinfection requirements. </T3>To avoid filtration, this rule requiresthat a system practice disinfection and have either (a) redundant disinfectioncapability, including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-upand alarm, to ensure that continuous disinfection is provided; or (b) automaticshut-off of delivery of water to the distribution system whenever the disinfectantresidual is less than 0.2 mg/l in the water. A system that fails to meeteither of these requirements must install filtration. The option of automaticshut-off is not permitted if the State determines that this action couldcause an unreasonable risk to health (e.g., automatic shut-off is not appropriateif it results in negative pressures within the distribution system or inadequatewater supplies for fire protection). (i) <T3>Maintenance of a disinfectant residual at the point of entry. </T3>Toavoid filtration, the disinfectant residual in water entering the distributionsystem cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than four hours, with oneexception noted below. Systems serving more than 3,300 persons must monitorcontinuously. If there is a failure in the continuous monitoring equipment,the system may substitute grab sampling every four hours for up to fiveworking days following the failure of the equipment. Systems serving 3,300or fewer people may monitor continuously or take grab samples at the frequenciesprescribed below:  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,9 </C>  <H1>System size by population </H1><H1>Samples/day \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1"> andCx.190;500 <D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50 to 1,000 <D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 2,500 <D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,501 to 3,300 <D>4 </D><F>\1\ Samples cannot be taken at the same time.

For all systems, ifthe residual concentration is not restored to at least 0.2 mg/l withinfour hours after a value of less than 0.2 mg/l is observed, the systemis in violation of a treatment technique requirement, and must installfiltration. However, if the State finds that the exceedance was causedby an unusual and unpredictable circumstance, the State may choose notto require filtration. EPA expects the States to use this provision sparingly;it is intended to encompass catastrophic events, not infrequent large stormevents. In addition, any time the residual concentration falls below 0.2mg/l, the system must notify the State. Notification must occur as soonas possible, but no later than by the end of the next business day. Thesystem also must notify the State by the end of the next business day whetheror not the residual was restored within four hours. (ii) <T3>Minimum percent inactivation requirements. </T3>To avoid filtration,a system must maintain disinfection operational conditions which inactivate99.9 percent of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent of viruses. To make thisdemonstration, the system must determine disinfectant residual(s), disinfectantcontact time(s), pH, and water temperature, and use these data to calculatewhether it is meeting the minimum total percent inactivation requirementsin the rule. (The CT values necessary to achieve 99.9 percent inactivationof <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent inactivation of virusesby various disinfectants and under various conditions are specified inthe rule.) A system is deemed in compliance  with the inactivation requirementsif the CT value(s) calculated for its disinfection conditions meet (orexceed) the relevant CT value specified in the rule. The system must makethis determination each day that it is delivering water to its customers.For disinfectants other than chlorine, a system may demonstrate, throughuse of a State-approved protocol for on-site disinfection challenge studiesor other information satisfactory to the State, that disinfection conditionsother than those specified in the rule are adequate for meeting the minimumlevels of inactivation.For the purpose of calculating CT values, disinfection contact time (inminutes) is the time it takes the water, during peak hourly flow, to movebetween the point of disinfectant application (or the previous point ofmeasurement) to a point before or at the point where the residual disinfectantconcentration (in mg/l) is measured (which in turn must be before or atthe first customer). The point of disinfectant application is defined asthe point where the disinfectant is applied and water downstream of thatpoint is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff. Contacttime in pipelines must be calculated based on ``plug flow'' (i.e., whereall water moves homogeneously in time between two points) by dividing theinternal volume of the pipeline by the peak hourly flow rate through thatpipeline. Contact time within mixing basins and storage reservoirs mustbe determined by tracer studies or an equivalent demonstration. Under this rule, systems with only one point of disinfectant applicationmay measure ``C'' at any number of points within the treatment train, determineeach corresponding ``T'' and thereby calculate the CTs for each sequenceto determine the percent inactivation achieved. The total inactivationratio achieved is the sum of all the fractional inactivations calculatedfor each point where disinfectant residual was measured. To determine thetotal inactivation ratio achieved using this method, the system must calculatethe CT for each point where ``C'' was measured (CTcalc) and compare thiswith the CT<T2>99.9</T2> value (the CT value required to achieve 99.9 percent inactivationof <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts) given in the rule for the particular conditions(pH, temperature, and residual disinfectant concentration) at that point.Specifically, the system must divide each calculated CT value by its correspondingCT<T2>99.9</T2> value in the rule to determine the inactivation ratio foreach point where ``C'' was measured. If the sum of the inactivation ratios,or<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,aw,4,8</C> <H1/><T4>0</T4><H1>CTcalc</H1><H2>CT</H2><T2>99.9</T2>,<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">is equal to or greater than 1.0 (i.e., the sum of all the sequencesfor which CT was calculated before or at the first customer provides 99.9percent or more inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts), the system is meeting the disinfectionperformance requirement. In other words, if: C<T2>1</T2>T<T2>1</T2>/CT<T2>99.9</T2> + C<T2>2</T2>T<T2>2</T2>/CT<T2>99.9</T2> + C<T2>3</T2>T<T2>3</T2>/C T<T2>99.9</T2> + . . . + C<T2>n</T2>T<T2>n</T2>/CT<T2>99.9</T2> &quot;1.0 (where CT<T2>99.9</T2> is specified in the rule for each combination of C<T2>1</T2>, C<T2>2</T2>, C<T2>3</T2>, . . . C<T2>n</T2>; temperature; and pH), the system is meeting the disinfectionperformance requirement.Systems need only calculate one CT (CTcalc) each day for a point beforeor at the first customer. Alternatively, systems have the option of calculatingmultiple CTs after the point of disinfectant application but before orat the first customer to determine the inactivation ratio. If one CT iscalculated (CTcalc) and this exceeds the applicable CT<T2>99.9</T2>, the system is meeting the disinfection performance requirement;this may be all that is necessary for systems with very low oxidant demandin the water or systems where it is obvious they will achieve at least99.9 percent inactivation.For systems with multiple points of disinfectant application (e.g., ozonefollowed by chlorine, or chlorine applied at two different points in thetreatment train), the inactivation ratio of each disinfectant sequencebefore or at the first customer must be used to determine the total inactivationratio. The disinfectant residual of each disinfection sequence and thecorresponding contact time must be determined at some point prior to thesubsequent disinfection application point(s) to determine the inactivationratio for that sequence, and whether the total inactivation ratio of 1.0or greater is achieved. For example, if the first disinfection sequenceprovided an inactivation ratio of \2/3\ (or 99 percent inactivation) andthe second disinfection sequence provided an inactivation ratio of \1/3\(or 90 percent inactivation), the total inactivation ratio would equal1.0 (\2/3\ + \1/3\ = 1). The total percent inactivation could also be determinedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,21,3</C> <H1>% inactivation=100^</H1><H1>100</H1><H2>10</H2>Y<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,11,8,4</C> <H1>where y=</H1><T4>0</T4><H1>(CTcalc)</H1><H2>(CT</H2><T2>99.9</T2>) <H1>andmultiply;3</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>If the system fails to achieve at least 99.9 percent inactivation (i.e.,the inactivation ratio is less than 1.0) any two or more days in one month,the system is in violation of a treatment technique requirement for thatmonth. If this violation occurs during a second month in any 12 consecutivemonths the system serves water to the public, the system must install filtration,unless the State determines that at least one of these violations was causedby circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable. A third violationin 12 months, regardless of the cause, triggers filtration.Guidance for determining the percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts and viruses under different conditions will be providedin the final Guidance Manual.(iii) <T3>Maintenance of a disinfectant residual in the distribution system.</T3>To avoid filtration, the disinfectant residual in the distribution systemcannot be undetectable in more than five percent of the samples in a month,for any two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public.Systems may measure HPC instead of disinfectant residual. Sites with HPCconcentrations of less than or equal to 500/ml are considered equivalentto sites with detectable residuals for the purpose of determining compliance.Public water systems must monitor for the presence of a disinfectant residual(or HPC levels) at the same frequency and locations as total coliform measurementstaken pursuant to the total coliform regulation published elsewhere intoday's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> However, if the State determines, based on site-specificconsiderations, that a system has no means for having a sample transportedand analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory within the requisite timeand temperature conditions (Method 907, APHA, 1985), but that the systemis providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, this requirementdoes not apply to that system.For systems which use both surface and ground water sources, the Statemay allow the system to take disinfectant residual or HPC samples at pointsother than the total coliform sampling locations if the State determinesthat such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) waterquality within the distribution system.If a system fails to maintain a detectable disinfectant residual or anHPC level of less than or equal to 500/ml in more than 5 percent of thesamples during a month, for any two consecutive months the system serveswater to the public, the system is in violation of a treatment techniquerequirement. In addition, this system must install filtration unless theState determines that the violation was not due to a deficiency in treatmentof the source water (e.g., the violation was due to a deficiency in thedistribution system, such as cross-connection contamination or failurein the pipeline).(2) <T3>Watershed control requirements.</T3> To avoid filtration, systems mustestablish and maintain an effective watershed control program to minimizethe potential contamination by <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses in the source water.The State must determine whether the watershed control program is adequateto limit potential contamination by<T3> Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses. In making this determination,the State must consider the comprehensiveness of the watershed review;the effectiveness of the system's program to monitor and control activitiesoccurring in the watershed that could have an adverse effect on water quality;and the extent to which the system has maximized land ownership and/orcontrol of land use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed controlprogram must: (1) Characterize the watershed hydrology and land ownership;(2) identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have anadverse effect on source water quality; and (3) monitor the occurrenceof activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.The public water system must demonstrate through ownership or written agreementswith landowners in the watershed, or a combination of both, that it controlsall human activities which may have an adverse effect on the microbiologicalquality of the source water. The system must submit an annual report tothe State that identifies any special concerns about the watershed andhow they are being handled; describes activities in the watershed thataffect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are expectedto occur in the future and describes how the public water system intendsto address them. For systems using a ground water source under the directinfluence of surface water, an approved wellhead protection program developedunder section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act may be used, if the Statedeems it appropriate, to meet these requirements. Guidance for developingand maintaining an effective watershed control program will be includedin the final Guidance Manual.(3) <T3>On-site inspection requirements. </T3>To avoid filtration, a systemmust have an annual on-site inspection conducted by the State, or by aparty approved by the State, which demonstrates that the system is maintainingan adequate watershed control program and reliable disinfection treatment.The purpose of the on-site inspection is to identify all microbiologicalhealth hazards and assess their present and future importance. The on-siteinspection must include:(a) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;(b) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how wellit is protected;(c) A review of the system's equipment maintenance program to ensure thatthere is low probability for failure of the disinfection process;(d) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;(e) A review of operating procedures;(f) A review of data records to insure that all required tests are beingconducted and results recorded, and that disinfection is effectively practiced;and(g) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment,system maintenance and operation, or data collection.The on-site inspection must be conducted by a competent individual(s) suchas a sanitary or civil engineer, sanitarian, or technician who has experiencein and knowledge about the operation and maintenance of a water system,and who has a sound understanding of public health principles and waterbornediseases. A report of the on-site inspection summarizing all findings mustbe prepared every year. The State will review the report and determinewhether the system is maintaining an adequate watershed control programand reliable disinfection treatment. EPA will include detailed suggestionsfor conducting an on-site inspection and interpreting the results in thefinal Guidance Manual.(4)<T3> Absence of waterborne disease outbreaks.</T3> To avoid filtration,a system cannot have been identified as a source of waterborne diseaseoutbreak, or if it has been so identified, the system must have been modifiedsufficiently to prevent another such occurrence, as determined by the State.An unfiltered system that has a waterborne disease outbreak is in violationof a treatment technique requirement which poses an acute risk to health.A ``waterborne disease outbreak'' is defined as a significant occurrenceof acute infectious illness that the State or local health agency has determinedto be epidemiologically associated with the ingestion of water from a publicwater system that is deficient in treatment.(5) <T3>Compliance with the total coliform maximum contaminant level (MCL).</T3>To avoid filtration, a system must comply with the MCL for total coliforms,published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> at least 11 out of the previous 12 months thesystem served water to the public on an ongoing basis, unless the Statedetermines that failure to meet this requirement was not caused by a deficiencyin treatment of the source water. If the State makes such a determination,the system is not required to install filtration. The total coliform rulerequires systems using surface water or ground water under the influenceof surface water which do not filter to collect a sample at or near thefirst customer each day that the turbidity level exceeds 1 NTU within 24hours of learning of the result and to analyze the sample for the presenceof total coliforms. (If the State determines that it is not possible forthe system to have such a sample analyzed within 24 hours, this time limitmay be extended on a case-by-case basis.) This sample may be used to fulfillthe routine compliance monitoring requirements of the total coliform rule.The results of the additional sample must be included in determining whetherthe system is in compliance with the monthly MCL for total coliforms.(6) <T3>Compliance with the total trihalomethane MCL.</T3> To avoid filtration,a system must comply with the total trihalomethane (TTHM) regulation (40CFR 141.12 and 141.30). An unfiltered system that violates the TTHM regulationmust install filtration. Currently, this requirement only applies to systemsserving more than 10,000 people. When new regulations for disinfectionby-products are promulgated, EPA expects they will apply to smaller systemsas well as these larger systems. At that time, those smaller systems wouldbe required to comply with these requirements to avoid filtration.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Criteria for Determining if Treatment is Adequate for FilteredSystems</ITAG>Systems which fail to meet one or more of the above criteria for avoidingfiltration must install filtration. This section describes the performancecriteria for these systems which must install filtration, as well as systemsthat already are filtering their water.(a)<T3> Disinfection requirements.</T3> Under this final rule, the requirementsfor maintaining a disinfectant residual at the entry point to the distributionsystem and in the distribution system described above for unfiltered systemsalso apply to filtered systems. The State must determine the level of disinfectionrequired for each system to ensure that the total treatment process (i.e.,filtration and disinfection) achieves at least a 99.9 percent (3-log) and99.99 percent (4-log) removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses, respectively. The final GuidanceManual will recommend different levels of disinfection as a function ofdifferent treatment technologies and source water qualities.(b) <T3>Turbidity monitoring requirements. </T3>Under this rule, systems servingmore than 500 people which use conventional treatment, direct filtration,or diatomaceous earth filtration must monitor the turbidity of representativefiltered water by grab sample every four hours (or more frequently) thatthe system is in operation. A system may substitute continuous turbiditymonitoring for grab sampling if it validates such measurements for accuracywith grab sample measurements on a regular basis, as specified by the State.If a system uses continuous monitoring, it must use the turbidity valuefor every four-hour interval (or some shorter regular time interval) todetermine compliance with the turbidity performance criterion. For systems using slow sand filtration or technologies other than conventionaltreatment, direct filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration (such ascartridge filtration), the State may reduce the sampling frequency forturbidity to one sample per day if the State determines that less frequentmonitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance.For systems serving 500 or fewer people, the State may reduce the samplingfrequency to once per day, regardless of the type of filtration treatmentused, if the State determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficientto indicate effective filtration performance. (c) <T3>Turbidity performance criteria</T3>_(1) <T3>Conventional treatment or direct filtration. </T3>For systems usingconventional treatment or direct filtration, the final rule requires thatthe filtered water turbidity level be less than or equal to 0.5 NTU in95 percent of the measurements taken every month, and at no time exceed5 NTU. The system must inform the State when the turbidity exceeds 5 NTUas soon as possible, but not later than the end of the next business day.The State may allow any system an alternate turbidity limit, up to 1 NTUin 95 percent of the meassurements, if the State determines that the systemis achieving the minimum overall performance requirement of 99.9 percentremoval and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts at the higher turbidity level. Such a determinationmay be based upon an analysis of existing design and operating conditions(e.g., adequacy of treatment prior to filtration, percent turbidity removalacross the entire treatment train, and level of disinfection), and/or filtrationeffectiveness relative to certain water quality measurements (e.g., microbiologicalanalysis of the filtered water, particle size counting before and afterthe filter). Under this provision, the State may consider such factorsas source water quality, extent of treatment, and system size to determinethe analysis necessary to justify the higher turbidity limit. In the finalGuidance Manual, EPA will provide additional information for determiningwhen it may be appropriate to allow higher turbidity performance criteria.All systems are expected to optimize their treatment so as to achieve thelowest turbidities feasible at all times. This will promote optimal removalof <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and other pathogens, and provide optimalconditions for disinfection. (2) <T3>Slow sand filtration. </T3>For systems using slow sand filtration,the final rule requires that the filtered water turbidity be 1 NTU or lessin 95 percent of the measurements taken each month and at no time exceed5 NTU. However, the State may allow a turbidity value greater than 1 NTU,but below 5 NTU, in 95 percent of the measurements if the State determinesthere is no significant interference with disinfection at the higher turbiditylevel. The system must inform the State when the turbidity exceeds 5 NTUas soon as possible, but not later than the end of the next business day.(3) <T3>Diatomaceous earth filtration. </T3>For systems using diatomaceousearth filtration, the filtered water turbidity must be less than or equalto 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month. Atno time may the turbidity exceed 5 NTU. The system must inform the Statewhen the turbidity exceeds 5 NTU as soon as possible, but not later thanthe end of the next business day. (4) <T3>Other filtration technologies. </T3>A public water system may use afiltration technology other than one described above if it demonstratesto the State, using pilot plant studies, conducted on-site or at anothersite with similar source conditions, that the alternative filtration technology,together with disinfection, consistently achieves 99.9 percent removaland/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivationof viruses. The system must meet the same turbidity limits prescribed forslow sand filtration. C. Reporting Requirements Reporting requirements for all public water systems which use a surfacewater source or a ground water source under the influence of surface waterare specified in andSection; 141.75 of the final rule. These reports aredesigned to document compliance with the treatment and monitoring requirementsin andSection;andSection; 141.71, 141.72, 141.73, and 141.74 (described above).Separate requirements are specified for systems which do not use filtrationand systems which do use filtration. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Unfiltered Systems </ITAG>Systems which do not use filtration are required to report to the Stateon a monthly basis whether they are meeting the treatment and monitoringrequirements for avoiding filtration, for each month they serve water tothe public. The report must include a summary of the results of sourcewater monitoring for total or fecal coliforms (if the system monitors forboth, only fecal coliforms must be reported) and turbidity, to demonstratecompliance with andSection; 141.71(a). The specific items to be reportedare listed in andSection; 141.75(a)(1).Each system that does not use filtration must report disinfection conditionsmonthly to demonstrate that: (1) It met the 99.9 percent <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cyst and 99.99 percent virus inactivation performancecriteria; (2) there was not less than 0.2 mg/l disinfectant residual inthe water supplied to the distribution system for more than four hours;(3) it met the requirement to have a detectable disinfectant residual oran HPC level less than or equal to 500/ml. The specific information aboutdisinfection to be reported is listed in andSection; 141.75(a)(2). Aftera system reports this information for one year, the State may waive mostof the disinfection reporting requirements. Other reporting requirements for systems which do not provide filtrationinclude: andbullet; An annual report which summarizes the system's compliance withall watershed control program requirements specified in andSection; 141.71(b)(2).andbullet; An annual report summarizing results of the on-site inspectionwhich evaluated the effectiveness of the watershed control program andthe reliability of the disinfection process, unless the on-site inspectionwas conducted by the State. If the inspection is conducted by the State,the State must provide a copy of its report to the public water system.andbullet; Reports of waterborne disease outbreaks, turbidity measurementsover 5 NTU, and failure to maintain a disinfectant residual of 0.2 mg/1at the point of entry to the distribution system for more than 4 hours.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Filtered Systems </ITAG>Public water systems which use filtration must report to the State on amonthly basis information regarding filtered water turbidity, disinfectantresidual concentration in the water entering the distribution system, anddisinfectant residual concentrations and/or HPC measurements in the distributionsystem. Turbidity reporting requirements vary depending upon the filtrationtechnology used. Reporting requirements pertaining to disinfection requirementsat the point of entry to the distribution system and within the distributionsystem are the same for filtered and unfiltered systems. The specific requirementsare set out in andSection; 141.75(b). Systems must also report waterborne disease outbreaks, turbidity measurementsover 5 NTU, and failure to maintain a disinfectant residual of 0.2 mg/1at the point of entry to the distribution system for more than 4 hours.D. Compliance <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Compliance Transition with Current Turbidity Requirements </ITAG>The existing (interim) NPDWR for turbidity, including the MCL in andSection;141.13 and the monitoring requirements in andSection; 141.22 will continuein effect for unfiltered systems using a surface water source until 30months after promulgation of this rule. However,  there is an exceptionto this requirement. If the State determines that a system must filter(in writing, in accordance with section 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii)) earlier than30 months from the promulgation date, that system must continue to complywith the interim turbidity rule until 48 months from promulgation or untilfiltration is installed, whichever is later. Thus, if the system installsfiltration before 48 months from promulgation, it would comply with theinterim turbidity requirements until 48 months from promulgation, and theturbidity requirements for filtered systems promulgated today in andSection;141.73 and andSection; 141.74(c) would apply after that date. It is important to note that, for awhile, unfiltered systems will be subjectto both the interim turbidity MCL and monitoring requirements, and theturbidity monitoring requirements for unfiltered systems promulgated inandSection; 141.74(b)(2), at the same time. This is appropriate because themonitoring required under andSection; 141.22 is different from that requiredunder andSection; 141.74(b)(2): andSection; 141.22, requires that samples betaken daily at a representative entry point to the distribution system,while andSection; 141.74(b)(2) requires that samples be taken every fourhours prior to the point of disinfectant application. Thus, the formeris a measure of finished water, while the latter is a measure of sourcewater quality. The interim requirements for turbidity under andSection;andSection; 141.13and 141.22 will apply to filtered systems using a surface water sourceuntil 48 months after the promulgation of this rule. Beginning 48 monthsafter the promulgation of this rule, the turbidity performance criteriafor filtered systems in andSection; 141.73 and the monitoring requirementsunder andSection; 141.74(c), both promulgated today, will apply. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Systems Using a Surface Water Source (Not Including Systems Usinga Ground Water Source Under the Direct Influence of Surface Water) </ITAG>As required by SDWA, within 18 months following the promulgation of thisrule, States must promulgate any regulations necessary to implement thisrule. Under section 1413, these rules must be at least as stringent asthose required by EPA. Within 30 months following promulgation of thisrule, each State must determine which systems are required to install filtration.If filtration is required, it must be installed within 48 months followingthe promulgation of this rule. If it is not feasible for a system to installfiltration within this time, the State may allow for a longer period underthe exemption provisions of section 1416, as discussed in Section IV.G,below. Procedures for State implementation of today's rule appear in SectionV, below. As described above, today's rule specifies (a) conditions systems mustmeet to avoid filtration (and other criteria for unfiltered systems), and(b) requirements that apply to filtered systems. Regardless of whetherthe State complies with the statutory schedule for adopting the criteriaand applying them to determine which systems must install filtration, eachsystem using a surface water source must comply with one or  the other,i.e., either the criteria for avoiding filtration and other requirementsfor unfiltered systems or the requirements for filtered systems, by therelevant statutory deadline. Thus, beginning 30 months after promulgationof this rule, the requirements for avoiding filtration specified in andSection;141.71 (a) and (b) and the requirements of andSection; 141.71(c) and andSection;141.72(a) go into effect unless the State already has determined that filtrationis required; a system that fails to meet any one of the criteria for avoidingfiltration in andSection; 141.71 (a) and (b) must install filtration andcomply with all the requirements for filtered systems (the general requirementsin andSection; 141.73 and the disinfection requirements in andSection; 141.72(b))within 48 months of promulgation. Likewise, beginning 30 months after promulgation,if a system fails to meet any one of the criteria for avoiding filtration,even if the system was meeting all the criteria up to that point, it mustinstall filtration and comply with the requirements for filtered systemswithin 18 months of the failure. In either case, whenever a State determinesthat filtration is required, it may specify interim requirements for theperiod prior to installation of filtration treatment.To obtain the information necessary to determine whether an unfilteredsystem is meeting the criteria for avoiding filtration in andSection; 141.71(a) and (b), the rule includes monitoring and reporting requirements forunfiltered systems (<T3>see</T3> andSection;andSection; 141.74(b) and 141.75(a), respectively).These requirements go into effect 18 months after promulgation of thisrule, unless the State has already determined that filtration is required.In reviewing these data, it is up to the State to determine how it willweigh the data gathered during the first 30 months following promulgationin deciding whether filtration is required. Thus, for instance, a systemmay not meet the specified CT requirements for the first four months ofmonitoring (i.e., months 19-23), upgrade its disinfection practice andthen begin meeting the CT values in subsequent months. In this case, theState could conclude that the system would be able to meet this criterionfor avoiding filtration, even though the system did not meet the criterion11 out of the 12 previous months, as specified in andSection; 141.71(b)(1).In other words, the time periods specified in the criteria for avoidingfiltration (e.g., six months for total coliforms, one year and ten yearsfor turbidity, one year for CT requirements) do not begin until 30 monthsfrom the date of promulgation (unless the State specifies an earlier date).All systems with filtration in place must meet the treatment techniquerequirements specified in andSection; 141.73 (filtration criteria) and andSection;141.72(b) (disinfection criteria), and the monitoring and reporting requirementsspecified in andSection;andSection; 141.74(c) and 141.75(b), respectively,beginning 48 months after promulgation.The above compliance dates are different from what were proposed. Underthe proposed rule, all monitoring, reporting, and treatment technique requirementsfor unfiltered and filtered systems would have gone into effect beginning48 months after promulgation of this rule. EPA believes that this schedulewould not have been consistent with the intent of the SDWA. First, EPAbelieves that the statutory schedule (i.e., States make filtration decisionswithin 30 months and systems install filtration 18 months later) contemplatesthat systems which meet the criteria for avoiding filtration will meetthem beginning no later than 30 months from promulgation, since this isthe date by which all filtration decisions are to be made. Accordingly,EPA changed the compliance date in the rule. Second, it is clear that Stateswill need monitoring information to determine whether systems are meetingthe criteria for avoiding filtration. Therefore, the final rule requiresunfiltered systems to begin monitoring 18 months from promulgation (unlessthe State has already determined that filtration is required).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Systems Using a Ground Water Source Under the Direct Influenceof Surface Water</ITAG>As explained in the section on State Implementation, below, the State'sprogram revisions to adopt this final rule must include procedures fordetermining, for each system in the State served by a ground water source,whether that source is under the direct influence of surface water. Withinfive and ten years following the promulgation of this rule (i.e., by June29, 1994 and June 29, 1999 each State must determine which community andnon-community public water systems, respectively, use ground water whichis under the direct influence of surface water. EPA recommends that thesedeterminations be made in conjunction with related activities requiredby other regulations (e.g., sanitary surveys pursuant to the final coliformrule, vulnerability assessments pursuant to the volatile organic chemicalsrule, assessment requirements in the forthcoming disinfection rule forground water systems). In addition, section 1428 of the Safe Drinking WaterAct requires States to develop wellhead protection programs for ground-watersupply wells. EPA-approved wellhead protection programs may contain methodsand criteria for determining zones of contribution, assessments of potentialcontamination, and management of sources of contamination. These programsmay be used as a partial basis for determining (a) whether a system isunder the direct influence of surface water and (b) if direct influenceexists, whether current watershed controls are adequate to meet the watershedcontrol requirement for avoiding filtration (andSection; 141.71(b)(2)). Guidelinesfor developing and implementing a State wellhead protection program arefound in ``Guidelines for Applicants for State Wellhead Protection ProgramAssistance Funds under the Safe Drinking Water Act'' (U.S. EPA, 1987d).A system using a ground water source under the influence of surface waterthat does not have filtration in place must begin monitoring and reportingin accordance with andSection;andSection; 141.74(b) and 141.75(a), respectively,to determine whether it meets the criteria for avoiding filtration in andSection;141.71 (a) and (b) beginning 18 months after promulgation or six monthsafter the State determines that the ground water source is under the influenceof surface water, whichever is later. Within 18 months following the determinationthat a system is under the direct influence of surface water, the Statemust determine, using the same criteria that apply to systems using a surfacewater source, whether the system must provide filtration treatment. (The18-month period was derived by adding the six months until monitoring beginsto the 12 months SDWA provides States to make the filtration decision forsystems using a surface water source.) Beginning 30 months after promulgationof this rule, or 18 months after the determination that a system is underthe direct influence of surface water, whichever is later, the criteriafor avoiding filtration in andSection; 141.71 (a) and (b) and the requirementsfor unfiltered systems in andSection; 141.71(c) and andSection; 141.72(a) gointo effect, unless the State has determined that filtration is required.Thus, a system using a ground water source under the influence of surfacewater that fails to meet any one of the criteria for avoiding filtrationafter the relevant date must install filtration and comply with all ofthe requirements for filtered systems (the general requirements in andSection;141.73 and the disinfection requirements in andSection; 141.72(b)) 48 monthsafter promulgation of this rule, or within 18 months of the failure tomeet the criteria for avoiding filtration, whichever is later. As withsystems using a surface water source, subsequent failure to comply withany one of the criteria for avoiding filtration also requires the installationof filtration treatment. Thus, beginning 30 months after promulgation or18 months after the State determines that a system is using a ground watersource under the direct influence of surface water, whichever is later,if that system fails to meet any one of those criteria (even if the systemwas meeting the criteria for avoiding filtration up to that point), itmust install filtration and comply with the requirements for filtered systemswithin 18 months of the failure. As with systems using a surface watersource, in reviewing the data collected by an unfiltered system using groundwater under the influence of surface water, for the first 18 months followingthe determination, it is up to the State to determine how it will weighthe data in deciding whether filtration is required.Any system using a ground water source that the State determines is underthe direct influence of surface water that already has filtration in placeat the time of the State determination must meet the treatment techniquerequirements specified in andSection; 141.73 (filtration criteria) and andSection;141.72(b) (disinfection criteria) and the monitoring and reporting requirementsspecified in andSection;andSection; 141.74(c) and 141.75(b), respectively,beginning 48 months after promulgation or 18 months after the State determination,whichever is later.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Strategies for Implementation </ITAG>To comply with this final rule, a system that uses surface water and doesnot currently disinfect its water must begin disinfection, and possiblyfiltration. While the system is being evaluated to determine what treatmentneeds to be installed (e.g., disinfection without filtration; disinfectionfirst and filtration later because of time differences needed for construction;or filtration and disinfection at the same time), the State may determinethat interim measures to reduce risk to health (e.g., notice to consumersthat water should be boiled before use or distribution of bottled water)might be appropriate. Similarly, for systems which are already disinfecting, but do not meetone or more of the requirements for avoiding filtration, the State maydetermine that interim measures are necessary to reduce risk to health(e.g., maintaining more stringent disinfection conditions until filtrationis installed). Some systems already have filtration and disinfection in place. While manysuch systems are already in compliance with all the requirements of therule, other systems will require significant upgrades in treatment to meetall the performance criteria. As discussed earlier, filtration withoutdisinfection, with proper pretreatment where appropriate, can be expectedto achieve 99 to 99.9 percent (2- to 3-log) removal of <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts and 90 to 99.9 percent (1- to 3-log) removal ofviruses (Logsdon, 1987). Some disinfection will be necessary to supplementfiltration so that the overall treatment achieves the minimum treatmentrequirements of the rule, i.e., 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivationof <T3>Giardia </T3>cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation ofviruses. To achieve these performance criteria with a substantial marginof safety, EPA recommends different minimum levels of disinfection, dependingupon the filtration technology in place.

However, for other disinfectants, dependingupon the filtration technology in place, the CT values for achieving therecommended minimum level of virus inactivation may in some cases be higherthan those necessary to achieve the minimum recommended level of <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst inactivation. Guidance for making these determinationswill be included in the final Guidance Manual. The degree of disinfection should be commensurate with the degree of potentialpathogen contamination in the source water and the type of clarificationand filtration. For example, the system should provide higher levels ofdisinfection (e.g., 99 or 99.9 percent inactivation of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts) when there is evidence of significant <T3>Giardia</T3> cyst contamination in the source water. Guidelines forproviding an appropriate level of disinfection as a function of sourcewater quality conditions and the extent of treatment processes will beavailable in the final Guidance Manual.E. Public Notification On October 29, 1987, EPA promulgated regulations to revise the existingpublic notification requirements in 40 CFR 141.32 to implement the 1986amendments to the public notification provisions in section 1414(c) ofthe Safe Drinking Water Act. These regulations specify general notificationrequirements, including the frequency, manner, and content of notices,and require the inclusion of EPA-specified health effects information ineach public notice. The public notification regulations divide violationsinto two tiers based on the seriousness of the violation, with each tierhaving different public notification requirements. Tier 1 violations includeviolations of an MCL, a treatment technique requirement, or a varianceor exemption schedule. Some Tier 1 violations are designated as violationsposing an ``acute'' risk to health. Tier 2 violations include violationof a monitoring requirement, failure to comply with a testing procedureprescribed by a NPDWR, and operating under a variance or exemption. Underthis rule, andSection;andSection; 141.70, 141.71(c), 141.72, and 141.73 prescribetreatment technique requirements. Thus, violation of these requirementsare classified as Tier 1 violations. Violations of andSection; 141.74, whichprescribes testing procedures and monitoring requirements, are classifiedas Tier 2 violations. Violations of andSection; 141.75 (reporting requirements)do not require public notification. All of the requirements of andSection; 141.32, the general public notificationrequirements, including the manner and frequency of notification, applyto violations of this final rule. The mandatory language to be includedin public notices for violations of the filtration and disinfection requirementsof this rule (i.e., andSection;andSection; 141.70, 141.71(c), 141.72, and 141.73),including an acute violation (i.e., a waterborne disease outbreak in anunfiltered supply), is specified below:<T3>Microbiological contaminants</T3> (for use when there is a violationof the treatment technique requirements for filtration and disinfectionin Subpart H of this part). The United States Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) sets drinking water standards and has determined that thepresence of microbiological contaminants are a health concern at certainlevels of exposure. If water is inadequately treated, microbiological contaminantsin that water may cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea,cramps, nausea, and possibly jaundice, and any associated headaches andfatigue. These symptoms, however, are not just associated with disease-causingorganisms in drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factorsother than your drinking water. EPA has set enforceable requirements fortreating drinking water to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects.Treatment such as filtering and disinfecting the water removes or destroysmicrobiological contaminants. Drinking water which is treated to meet EPArequirements is associated with little to none of this risk and shouldbe considered safe.The above mandatory public notification language was changed from whatwas proposed. Types of disease, namely hepatitis, giardiasis, and gastroenteritis,which might be caused by consumption of inadequately treated water, havebeen deleted. Also, wording has been added which indicates that symptomswhich may be associated with consumption of inadequately treated watermay be caused by other factors not associated with drinking water. Thesechanges were made in response to public comments which expressed concernthat the general public would not be familiar with disease names such asgiardiasis and gastroenteritis, and that most of the symptoms mentionedin the notice are so common that the water treatment plant might be consideredresponsible without justification. F. VariancesSection 1415 allows States to grant variances from national primary drinkingwater regulations under certain conditions. However, section 1412(b)(7)(C)(ii)of the Safe Drinking Water Act states that, in lieu of the variance provisionsof section 1415, EPA is to specify criteria by which States will determinewhich public water systems will be required to filter. This notice promulgatesthese filtration criteria. Accordingly, the rule does not permit variancesfrom the filtration requirements. As for the disinfection requirementsin this rule, due to the acute nature and high risk associated with poordisinfection of surface waters, no variances are allowed.G. ExemptionsSection 1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act allows a State to exempt anypublic water system within its jurisdiction from any treatment techniquerequirement imposed by a national primary drinking water regulation upona finding that:1. Due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors), thepublic water system is unable to comply with the treatment technique requirement;2. The public water system was in operation on the effective date of thetreatment technique requirement or, for a system that was not in operationby that date, only if no reasonable alternative source of drinking wateris available to the new system; and3. The granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable riskto health.If a State grants a public water system an exemption, the State must prescribe,at the time the exemption is granted, a schedule for:1. Compliance (including increments of progress) by the public water systemwith each treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exemptionwas granted; and2. Implementation by the system of such control measures as the State mayrequire during the period the exemption is in effect.Before prescribing a schedule, the State must provide notice and opportunityfor a public hearing on the schedule. The schedule prescribed must requirecompliance by the public water system with the treatment technique requirementas expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than one year afterthe exemption is issued (except that, if the system meets certain requirements,the final date for compliance may be extended for a period not to exceedthree years from the date the exemption is granted). For systems servingfewer than 500 service connections, and meeting certain additional requirements,the State may renew the exemption for one or more additional two-year periods.Under this rule, no exemptions are allowed from the requirement to providedisinfection for surface water systems, for the same reason variances arenot allowed. However, exemptions are available to reduce the degree ofdisinfection required. Exemptions from the filtration requirements areavailable as well. For example, under certain conditions, it might be appropriatefor an unfiltered system to receive an exemption, for a limited time, ifit achieves only 99 percent inactivation of<T3> Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts (i.e., it did not meet the 99.9 percentinactivation requirement). Guidance for determining conditions under whichan exemption might be appropriate is provided in the final Guidance Manual.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. State Implementation of the Surface Water Treatment Requirements</ITAG>A. GeneralSection 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act establishes requirements aState must meet to have primary enforcement responsibility for public watersystems (``primacy''). These include: (1) Adopting drinking water regulationsno less stringent than the NPDWRs in effect under sections 1412(a) and1412(b) of the Act; (2) adopting and implementing adequate procedures forenforcement; (3) keeping records and making such reports with respect toits activities as EPA may require by regulation; (4) issuing variancesand exemptions (if allowed at all by the State) under conditions no lessstringent than allowed by sections 1415 and 1416; and (5) adopting andbeing able to implement an adequate plan for the provision of safe drinkingwater under emergency situations.40 CFR Part 142 sets out the specific program implementation requirementsfor States to obtain primacy for the public water system supervision (PWSS)program as authorized under Section 1413 of SDWA. EPA first promulgatedthese regulations on January 20, 1976. Since 1976, however, much has happenedin the PWSS program, and portions of the implementation regulations at40 CFR Part 142 have become outdated. In response, on August 2, 1988, theAgency proposed revisions to 40 CFR Part 142, Subpart B which take intoaccount the program's evolution since 1976, as well as the new legislativemandates (53 FR 29194). These regulations, when promulgated, will specifythe procedures and timing for States to follow to obtain approval of programchanges to adopt new or revised regulations that EPA promulgates.When today's regulations for surface water treatment were proposed on November3, 1987 (52 FR 42178), the schedule for revising the implementation regulations(40 CFR Part 142) was not known. Consequently, the implementation portionof the proposed surface water treatment requirements included a completelist of requirements for States to meet to obtain approval of their programrevisions, including both general requirements applicable to all programrevisions (e.g., regulations that are no less stringent than the NPDWRsthat EPA promulgates in Part 141), as well as specific requirements applicableonly to the surface water treatment provisions. However, EPA expects topromulgate the revised implementation regulations shortly. These implementationregulations will specify procedures, timing, and other general requirementsa State must meet to retain primary enforcement responsibility. For instance,these final rules will make it clear that each time EPA adopts (or revises)an NPDWR under section 1412, primacy States must adopt drinking water regulationsthat are no less stringent than the new regulations. Therefore, today'samendments to Part 142 only address ``special primacy requirements,'' i.e.,requirements that are unique to the surface water treatment requirementspromulgated in Part 141; general primacy requirements applicable to allNPDWRs are not addressed in today's amendment of 40 CFR Part 142.In some respects, the State implementation of the regulations in 40 CFRPart 141, Subpart H_Filtration and Disinfection, is different from implementationof other NPDWRs. The surface water treatment requirements promulgated todayconsist of both objective, uniform criteria and criteria that provide theprimacy State broad discretion to decide whether to implement them (andif so, how), considering the objectives of the regulations and the variabilityencountered in surface water treatment throughout the diverse geographicalareas of the United StatesAs a condition of primacy, States must promulgate regulations that incorporaterequirements that are no less stringent than these objective criteria inthe surface water treatment requirements. Since the general primacy rulewill require all State program revisions to include requirements that areno less stringent than Federal requirements, today's amendments to Part142 do not list each provision of the surface water treatment requirementsfor which the State must adopt a corresponding revision which is no lessstringent. (However, to assist States developing program revisions to adopttoday's regulations, Section V.B.1. below identifies such provisions.)Where it was not possible to develop uniform national criteria or whereStates are provided flexibility to modify the national criteria to accountfor site-specific circumstances, the surface water treatment requirementsgive the States discretion to adopt appropriate requirements. For purposesof implementation, EPA has divided these areas of State discretion intotwo categories. For items in the first category, the State must demonstratethat it has adopted enforceable requirements in the form of State rules,regulations, and/or permit requirements. For items in the second category,the State need only describe the practices or procedures it will use toimplement those parts of its program. The specific items in these two categoriesare listed in Sections V.B.2 and 3 below.Where the State must have enforceable rules, regulations, and/or permitrequirements, i.e., elements in the first category, EPA review of thisportion of the State program revision will generally be limited to a determinationthat the State requirements are enforceable, rather than a detailed evaluationof the content of the requirements per se. For items in the second category,where the State only is required to describe the practices or proceduresit will use in exercising the discretion provided in the surface watertreatment requirements, EPA review of the State program revision will generallybe even more limited. It will consider whether the State practices or proceduresare clear and unambiguous. In both cases, however, EPA will consider whetherthe State's provisions can be reasonably expected to accomplish the objectivesof the surface water treatment requirements.B. Specific Primacy Requirements for States to Adopt 40 CFR Part 141 SubpartH_Filtration and DisinfectionThe three types of provisions States must adopt are described in greaterdetail below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Primacy Requirements_State Requirements Must Be No LessStringent than Federal Requirements</ITAG>As explained above, for those portions of the surface water treatment requirementspromulgated today which establish objective criteria, primacy States mustadopt equivalent, i.e., no less stringent, requirements. Although theseobjective criteria are not listed in the revisions to Part 142 for thereasons described in the previous section, EPA has, for convenience, summarizedthese criteria below. (Some of these criteria allow exceptions on a case-by-casebasis, as described in Part 141, Subpart H. These exceptions are listedin andSection; 142.16(b)(2) (iii) and (iv) of the rule and Section V.B.3of this preamble. For each provision that allows exceptions, States maychoose to simply adopt the requirement as listed here (allowing for exceptions),or permit the exceptions described in the later section.)

Special Primacy Requirements_State Requirements Must Be Enforceable</ITAG>State program revisions to adopt the surface water treatment requirementspromulgated today in Part 141, Subpart H must include enforceable requirementsthat specify design and operating conditions for all disinfection and filtrationtreatment processes and/or equipment used by public water systems to complywith 40 CFR 141.70, 141.71, 141.72 and 141.73. Alternatively (or in combinationwith enforceable design and operating conditions), the State may establisha procedure for setting enforceable design and operating requirements ona system-by-system basis (e.g., a permit system). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Special Primacy Requirements_State Must Establish Practices orProcedures </ITAG>An application for approval of a State program revision must describe thepractices or procedures that the State will use to implement provisionsof the surface water treatment requirements that provide the State flexibilitywith respect to how the objectives of the regulation are to be achieved.Examples include the authority to modify certain monitoring, analytical,performance, and reporting requirements; approve alternate disinfectionprocesses or technologies; determine whether the combination of treatmentsprovided achieve the required level of removal and/or disinfection; establishqualifications for public water system operators and parties conductingon-site inspections; and determine which systems supplied by ground waterare under the direct influence of surface water. It is important to note that these provisions take two forms: Provisionsin Part 141, Subpart H, that give the States full implementation discretionand provisions that allow the State to modify the stated requirements undercertain circumstances if the State so chooses. The corresponding primacyrequirements depend on the category of the provision. For each of the provisions in andSection; 142.16(b)(2)(i), which fall inthe first category, State program revisions must include a descriptionof the practices and procedures (or regulations, if they cover these items)that explain how the State will exercise its discretion. Likewise, Stateswhich allow public water systems to avoid filtration by meeting the requirementsof andSection; 141.71 must also submit the practices and procedures (or regulations)describing how they will exercise their discretion for each of the provisionslisted in andSection; 142.16(b)(2)(ii). Provisions in the second category are listed in andSection; 142.16(b)(2)(iii)(which are options available to all States) and in andSection; 142.16(b)(2)(iv)(which are options available to States that allow systems to avoid filtrationby meeting the requirements of andSection; 141.71). For each of the provisionsin this second category, the State needs to submit procedures and practices(or regulations) that explain how it will exercise the discretion allowedonly for those options it plans to exercise. For instance, if the Statedoes not plan to set alternative turbidity limits under andSection; 141.73(a)(1) or (b)(1), its program revision need not address this provision,i.e., it need not submit anything under andSection; 142.16(b)(2)(iii)(C).C. State Reproting and Recorddeeping Requirements Today's notice amends 40 CFR Part 142 to require States with primary enforcementresponsibility to retain records and report information to EPA sufficientto ensure adequate oversight of the States' activities to implement thesurface water treatment requirements. Specifically, States must: (1) Retain for not less than one year records of microbiological analyses,i.e., analyses for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and heterotrophicplate count (in both finished water and source water), in a form whichmakes possible comparison with the total coliform, fecal coliform, andheterotrophic plate count limits specified in 40 CFR 141.63, 141.71, and141.72. (2) Retain for not less than one year records of disinfectant residualmonitoring and other parameters necessary to document disinfection effectivenessin accordance with andSection; 141.72. Reports submitted by public watersystems must comply with andSection; 141.75. (3) Retain for not less than one year records of turbidity monitoring necessaryto document filtration effectiveness in accordance with andSection; 141.73.Reports submitted by public water systems must comply with andSection; 141.75.(4) Retain, for specified periods, records of determinations made by theState where the State has exercised discretionary authority allowed byandSection; 142.16(b). This discretionary authority includes modified monitoring,analytical, performance, and reporting requirements, as well as authorityto qualify operators or approve on-site inspectors. Where such decisionsare made on a system-by-system or case-by-case basis, the State must keepa record in its files which documents that decision. A State is requiredto provide a formal, written notice of certain determinations to the system(e.g., reduced monitoring and substitute turbidity limits), and it maywant to do so in other instances to prevent confusion on the part of thesystem or other party. Appropriate cases could include notification ofqualified operators and approved on-site inspectors. A list of determinationsfor which these records must be kept is included in the rule promulgatedtoday in andSection; 142.14(a)(4)(ii).(5) Retain indefinitely records of any determination under andSection; 141.71that a public water system using a surface water source or a ground watersource under the direct influence of surface water is not required to providefiltration treatment. (6) Report annually the name and PWS identification number of each publicwater system using a surface water source or a ground water source underthe direct influence of surface water that the State has determined neednot provide filtration treatment, and the date that the State made thedetermination for each such system. (7) Report annually the name and PWS identification number and date ofeach determination of each public water system supplied by a surface watersource or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface waterthat the State determined is providing adequate disinfection even if thesystem is not meeting the criteria for residual disinfectant concentrationspecified by andSection; 141.72(a)(4)(i) or 141.72(b)(3)(i). (8) Notify EPA within 60 days of the end of each calendar quarter of anydetermination that a public water system using a surface water source ora ground water source under the direct influence of surface water is notrequired to provide filtration treatment. D. EPA Oversight of State Decisions Regarding Filtration Requirements EPA intends to periodically review States' decisions as to whether publicwater systems supplied by a surface water source or a ground water sourceunder the direct influence of surface water are required to provide filtration.EPA will use procedures similar to those spelled out in Section 1415(a)(1)(F)of the Act for EPA oversight of variances issued by States. EPA considersthis to be an appropriate procedure for review of filtration decisionssince (1) the Act links filtration determinations and decisions on variancesby requiring EPA to specify ``in lieu of the variance requirements of Section1415'' procedures by which States are to determine which public water systemsmust adopt filtration, and (2) the filtration and variance decisions aresimilar in nature. Essential elements of this procedure which appears at40 CFR Part 142, Subpart I include: (1) Reporting by States of filtrationdecisions; (2) periodic review, preceded by<T4> Federal Register </T4>notice, of State filtration decisions by EPA;(3) notice to the State if the Administrator finds the State has abusedits discretion in making filtration decisions; (4) an opportunity for theState to take corrective action; (5) a public hearing conducted by a hearingofficer to review testimony; and (6) a final decision by the Administratorthat upholds or rescinds the finding that the State has abused its discretion.In the event the Administrator finds that the State has abused its discretion,(s)he would revoke decisions with regard to filtration made by the Stateand/or revoke any compliance schedule approved by the State. It is important to note that EPA need not undergo these procedures priorto taking an enforcement action against a specific public water systemfor failure to comply with today's rule, if, for instance, the State hasdetermined that the system is not required to filter, but the system isnot complying with the requirements for avoiding filtration. Likewise,promulgation of the procedures in Part 142, Subpart I does not precludeEPA from using other appropriate means to ensure that the State exercisesits discretion properly. Such measures may include grant conditions orinitiation of primacy revocation procedures when there is evidence thata State is not making appropriate filtration decisions. E. Response to Comments on Proposed Requirements for State Implementationof the Surface Water Treatment Requirements Commenters on the proposed surface water treatment requirements and theassociated proposed implementation regulations at 40 CFR 142.16 (52 FR42178, November 3, 1987) generally focused on the requirements addressedto public water systems in the primary regulation (i.e., the Part 141 provisions)rather than the proposed State implementation requirements. However, somecommenters did express concern that the proposed SWTR implementation regulationswould require them to adopt enforceable regulations, which EPA could disapprove,without EPA having to propose and receive comment on the appropriate criteriafor approving such revisions. Some commenters also expressed concern thatEPA, through the primacy review process, would attempt to establish uniformnational criteria for treatment requirements that would not account forlocal variability. Finally, some commenters were concerned that the proposedamendments to andSection; 142.17 (special primacy requirements, promulgatedtoday in andSection; 142.16) implied that States must adopt provisions toexempt some systems using surface water sources from the filtration requirements.Other commenters suggested that EPA was asking for too much informationfrom both systems and States. In the final rule, EPA has revised the State implementation requirementsin response to commenters' concerns. First, EPA expects to promulgate revisedgeneral implementation regulations shortly; these revised provisions willestablish standard procedures, timing, and other requirements States mustmeet to revise their programs following promulgation by EPA of new or revisednational primary drinking water regulations. Accordingly, the general Stateprogram revision requirements in the November 3, 1987, notice are not includedin today's final rule. Since the forthcoming amendments of the primacyrule will require that, whenever EPA adopts new or revised NPDWRs, Statesadopt requirements no less stringent than these NPDWRs, it is not necessaryto list each new requirement promulgated in Part 141 in Part 142 as well.As a result, the list of special primacy requirements to adopt this regulationhas been significantly reduced. Special primacy requirements are limitedto those included in 40 CFR 142.16(b), promulgated today (and describedearlier). Today's implementation provisions (in both the regulation and preamble)make it clear that EPA is not establishing uniform national treatment requirementsthrough the program revision process. States are given a great deal ofdiscretion in implementation; many provisions in the final rule may bemodified by the States in appropriate circumstances. Also, the languagepromulgated in andSection; 142.16(b)(2) clearly indicates that States havethe option to require that all public water systems using surface watersources or ground water directly influenced by surface water provide filtrationtreatment. Finally, the amount of public water system reporting to States has beenreduced to the lowest level practicable. This reduces the State recordkeepingrequirements as well. In addition, the number and frequency of reportsStates are required to provide EPA has been reduced. Those that remainare considered essential for EPA to perform its oversight function.<ITAG tagnum="84"> VI. Economic Analysis</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirements of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This action constitutes a ``major'' regulatory action because it will havea major financial or adverse impact on the regulated community of over$100 million per year. Therefore, EPA prepared a Regulatory Economic ImpactAnalysis for both the proposed and final rules and submitted them to theOffice of Management and Budget for review. In the draft RIA (USEPA, 1987c),the capital cost was estimated to be $2.0 billion, and the annualized cost,$338 million.In response to public comments on the estimated cost of complying withthe rule as proposed, EPA made several changes in its estimating methodologywhich resulted in a significant increase in the projected compliance cost.The nature of these changes, and their corresponding effects on the originalcost estimates, are described below.1.<T3> Land, piping, and pumping costs in newly installed filtration plants.</T3>These items were not included in the earlier analysis because they arehighly site-specific. Including these costs increases EPA's previous estimateby $695 million for capital, or $121 million/year on an annualized basis.It should be borne in mind, however, that the costs used are extremelyrough estimates.2.<T3> Disinfection for filtered systems.</T3> At the time of proposal, EPAdid not include any costs for upgrading disinfection practices becausethe Agency believed that most systems were already complying with disinfectionstandards similar to those in the proposed rule (e.g., the ``Ten-StateStandards''). Subsequently, EPA learned that, in fact, many systems willneed to upgrade their disinfection practice to comply with the disinfectionrequirements of this rule, and has adjusted its cost estimate accordingly.EPA expects systems to expend an estimated $258 million in capital costsfor improved disinfection. On an annualized basis, this amounts to an additional$27 million/year.Other costs which commenters suggested EPA should include in the estimatehave not been estimated, as explained below:1.<T3> Covering open distribution reservoirs.</T3> Apparently, some commentersthought this was a requirement of the proposed rule. This is incorrect.Such a requirement was not part of the proposed rule and is not requiredin the final rule, either. Therefore, the cost of covering reservoirs isnot considered to be a compliance cost imposed by this rule.2.<T3> Preparation of environmental impact statements and mitigation of environmentalimpacts.</T3> Costs for these items are highly site-specific. To projectthem with any degree of accuracy would require an engineering cost studyof each system in the U.S. Clearly, this is not possible. Also, relativeto other costs, these costs are not expected to be significant. Therefore,the final RIA (USEPA, 1989a) does not assess these costs.3.<T3> Installation of meters and correction of leaks in the distributionsystem.</T3> EPA agrees that, in systems experiencing high rates of leakage,it may well make good economic sense to correct excessive leaks in viewof the higher cost of produced water resulting from compliance with thisrule. Likewise, unmetered systems tend to encourage extravagant use andthe additional costs imposed by this rule might cause operators to feelthat the provision of unmetered water can no longer be justified. Nevertheless,the correction of leaks and installation of meters are economy measuresand are not required to achieve compliance with the rule. Therefore, theircost is not properly attributable to these requirements. (Even if suchcosts were attributable to the rule, they should be offset by the savingsfrom the reduction in leakage and wasteful use. In fact, it is conceivablethat, over the long run, such savings could largely offset the cost ofcompliance with this rule.) Finally, the cost of correcting leaks is highlysite-specific and EPA knows of no way to make a reasonably accurate estimateof such costs other than performing engineering studies at each affectedlocation, which clearly is not feasible. Based upon these considerations,EPA has not included any costs for leak correction and meter installation.The following sections summarize EPA's detailed cost analysis providedelsewhere (USEPA, 1987c, 1989a).A. Total Cost of the Final RuleThe filtration and disinfection requirements of this rule will impose costson four groups of public water systems using surface water sources:1. An estimated 1,346 community water systems that are currently unfiltered.2. An estimated 1,536 non-community water systems that are currently unfiltered(non-community water systems include systems serving transient and non-transientpopulations).3. An estimated 4,611 community water systems that are currently filtered.4. An estimated 2,308 non-community water systems that are currently filtered.There are, therefore, an estimated total of 2,882 water systems that arecurrently unfiltered and 6,919 systems that are currently filtered whichwill be affected by this rule. All 2,882 unfiltered surface water systemswill incur some costs under this rule. However, systems that meet the specifiedrequirements for avoiding filtration will not incur the costs associatedwith installing filtration.Of the estimated 6,919 filtered surface water systems, EPA estimates thatabout 5,128 will incur total annualized costs of $113 million per yearto upgrade their systems from their current level of performance to meetthe new turbidity requirements. Were all of them in compliance with theexisting (interim) national primary drinking water regulations at thistime, the annualized cost to the nation would be only $95 million per year.However, EPA estimates that 1,409 systems are not. Thus, these systemswill have to do more than those in compliance with the interim rule tomeet the new requirements. For these deficient systems, the additionalcost of meeting the new regulations is $18 million per year. The annualizedcost of $95 million is considered to be the ``incremental'' cost of thisrule because it is based on a comparison between the cost of complyingwith the new requirements and the cost of complying with the interim regulations(assuming 100 percent compliance). The annualized cost of $113 millionis considered to be the ``total'' cost of today's rule because it takesinto account the additional expense to be incurred by systems not presentlycomplying with the interim regulations.The same 6,919 filtered water systems will also be subject to the disinfectionperformance requirements. As discussed earlier, at the time of proposal,these costs were not believed to be significant and thus were not includedin the estimates. It is now estimated that approximately 1,200 of thesesystems will have to upgrade their disinfection practices, at a cost of$27 million/year. EPA also has estimated compliance costs for systems usinga ground water source under the direct influence of surface water. Thesesystems will incur capital costs of $164 million and annualized costs of$11 million per year.All systems subject to this rule, except those which are able to avoidfiltration, will incur incremental annualized monitoring costs of $17 million.The total annualized monitoring cost of $18 million takes into accountthe additional expense to be incurred by systems not currently complyingwith the interim monitoring regulations. Monitoring costs for systems thatmeet the criteria for avoiding filtration were counted as costs of treatmentfor unfiltered systems. States will incur annualized implementation costsof $12 million.The estimated costs of the proposed and final surface water treatment requirementsare presented in Table VI-1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>VI-1._<T4>Projected Cost of the Proposed and Final Surface Water Treatment Requirements</T4><H1>Cost category</H1><H1>Costs under the proposed rule</H1><H2>Capital cost ($mil)</H2><H2>Annualized cost ($mil/yr.)</H2><H1>Current estimate</H1><H2>Capital cost ($mil)</H2><H2>Annualized cost ($mil/yr.)</H2> <T3>Treatment Requirements </T3><ITAG tagnum="2">Unfiltered Systems (installing or avoiding filtration) <D>1613 </D><D>216 </D><D>2308 </D><D>337 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Filtered Systems </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Turbidity Reduction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Incremental <D>333 </D><D>95 </D><D>333 </D><D>95 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>NA </D><D>NA </D><D>403 </D><D>113 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Disinfection </ITAG><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>258 </D><D>27 </D><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface-Influenced Ground Water Systems <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>164 </D><D>11 </D></ITAG><T3>Monitorinq Requirements </T3><ITAG tagnum="12">All Surface Systems Except Those Able to Avoid Filtration\1\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Incremental <D>58 </D><D>20 </D><D>30 </D><D>17 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>NA </D><D>NA </D><D>30 </D><D>18 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>State Program Costs </T3><D>0 </D><D>7 </D><D>0 </D><D>12</D><R/></ITAG><T3>Cost of Rule </T3><ITAG tagnum="4">Incremental <D>2004 </D><D>338 </D><D>3093 </D><D>499 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>NA </D><D>NA </D><D>3163 </D><D>518  </D><F>NA=not applicable. </F><F>\1\ For the projected 16 percent of systems able to avoid filtration,the monitoring costs associated with meeting the criteria for avoidingfiltration are included as costs of treatment for unfiltered systems.</F></ITAG></ITAG> B. Concepts of Cost Analysis Capital, operating, and annualized costs for individual filtration anddisinfection technologies appear in ``Technologies and Costs for the Removalof Microbiological Contaminants from Potable Water Supplies'' (USEPA, 1988b).The annualizing procedure used in that document is intended to reflectthe actual financing cost that a typical water system might face in capitalmarkets, i.e., it is an estimate of the ``market'' cost. However, the totalannual cost estimate of $518 million discussed above (see Table VI-1) isintended to represent the total ``social'' cost to the nation for purposesof making benefit/cost comparisons. It is computed using a different discountrate. The discount rate used to assess ``market'' cost is ten percent.This is made up of three components: (1) A risk premium (reflecting themarket's assessment of the risk of default); (2) an inflation premium (reflectingthe market's expectations about the economy); and, (3) the true carryingcost of capital (the time value of money). The first two components arefinancial concepts while the third is both a financial and an economicconcept. The ``social'' discount rate consists only of the third of thesethree components because the benefits to which costs are being comparedare a risk-free, inflation-free economic concept. Three percent was selectedfor use in these analyses. An analysis of costs based on the financing options a typical system mightface in capital markets appears in Figure VI-1. C. Costs of Compliance for Currently Unfiltered Surface Water Systems EPA based its estimates of the number of community and non-community watersystems that are currently unfiltered on a survey conducted by the Associationof State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA, 1986). EPA estimated thetotal national cost of compliance for the 2,882 currently unfiltered systemsusing a straightforward procedure for forecasting likely compliance choices.Predicted compliance choices for the 2,867 systems which each serves fewerthan 100,000 people, appear in Table VI-2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,10,r30 </C><T4>Table </T4>VI-2._<T4>Predicted Compliance Choices for Unfiltered Systems  </T4><H1>Number of systems</H1><H1>Projected action</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">457 <D>Meet requirements for avoiding filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">899 <D>Switch to an alternate water source (ground or purchased). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">221 <D>Install a package treatment plant. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">58 <D>Install conventional treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">89 <D>Install direct filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115 <D>Install diatomaceous earth filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">990 <D>Install slow sand filtration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38 <D>Install ultrafiltration.</D></ITAG></ITAG>  EPA based the forecasts of compliance choices largely on the comparativecosts of the different options. The Agency predicted that slow sand filtration,switching to an alternate source, and package treatment plants would bepopular solutions due to the relatively low costs of these technologiescompared to other technologies and the preponderance of small water systemsamong those affected (over 90 percent of currently unfiltered water systemsserve fewer than 10,000 people). It is important to note that a large proportion of total costs for currentlyunfiltered systems is attributable to a small group of fifteen unfilteredsystems which each serves more than 100,000 people. These fifteen systemsaccount for approximately 40 percent of the $518 million total annualizedcost. However, these fifteen systems also serve approximately 16 millionof the estimated 21.4 million people exposed to unfiltered surface water(75 percent). As discussed above, the cost estimates presented with the proposed ruledid not include certain site-specific cost elements, such as land costsand costs of additional piping and pumping, due to the difficulty of assessingthese site-specific factors. EPA believes these costs could increase thetotal cost of installing filtration on the order of $695 million, or $121million per year on an annualized basis, over the original estimate. Figure VI-1 illustrates the system level market costs of complying withthe filtration requirement for system size categories serving fewer than100,000 persons. The costs shown represent the approximate high and lowextremes of the cost of installing filtration. For systems serving fewerthan 10,000 people, EPA used slow sand filtration as the basis for thelow-cost estimate and package treatment as the basis for the high-costestimate. For systems serving between 10,000 and 100,000 people, EPA useddirect filtration to represent the low-cost case and conventional treatmentfor the high-cost estimate. System level costs for installing filtrationin the 15 large systems, i.e., the systems which serve more than 100,000persons and not represented in Figure VI-1, were based on a case-by-caseassessment of the actual types and sizes of filter plants that might bebuilt in those cities. These costs ranged from $0.37 to $0.72 per thousandgallons of water produced.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 184</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>D. Costs of Compliance for Currently Filtered Surface Water Systems EPA estimated the total national cost of the turbidity performance requirementsfor filtered systems using a methodology which utilized survey data froma random sample of over 500 water systems, stratified by system size. Thesurvey data provide a profile of the type of filtration technologies currentlyin place and their turbidity performance. A summary of the survey datais presented elsewhere (ASDWA, 1986). EPA estimates that the average monthly turbidity in the water industryis currently 0.7 NTU. For the purposes of the Regulatory Impact Analysis,EPA assumed that the turbidity performance requirement in this final rule(less than 0.5 NTU, 95 percent of the time) for systems using rapid granularmedia filtration, i.e., direct filtration or conventional treatment (systemsusing diatomaceous earth or slow sand have less stringent turbidity performancerequirements), is equivalent to a monthly average of about 0.3 NTU. Fromthe survey data, EPA estimated that approximately 5,128 systems exceedthis average. Of these, 1,409 are estimated to be in violation of the interimturbidity requirement, which is a monthly average of 1 NTU. EPA further subdivided the systems which currently do not meet the turbidityperformance requirements in the final rule by size and type of filtrationprocess currently in place. A forecast of the likely compliance choicesof systems in each subcategory was developed. The compliance choices evaluatedinclude various combinations of the following: andbullet; Hiring a consulting engineer to do a diagnostic analysis; andbullet; Improving operation and maintenance practices; andbullet; Adding rapid mix; andbullet; Adding pH adjustment capability; andbullet; Replacing filter media; andbullet; Adding polymer; andbullet; Adding alum or FeCl<T2>3</T2>; andbullet; Adding flocculation or contact chambers. The system-level cost of each of the above compliance options is estimatedelsewhere (USEPA, 1987c, 1988a). Average system-level costs based on variouscombinations of these options, are shown in Table VI-3. The total nationalcapital cost, based on predicted compliance choices, is $403 million. Thetotal annualized cost is $113 million.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,s25,8</C><T4>Table </T4>VI-3._<T4>Costs of Upgrading To Meet Turbidity Performance Requirements</T4><H1>System size (by population served)</H1><H1> Costs  (andCx.11;/1,000 gallons)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">25 to 100<D>78</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101 to 500<D>32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">501 to 1,000<D>27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 3,300<D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301-10,000<D>7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001-25,000<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,001-50,000<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;50,000<D>andless;2</D></ITAG></ITAG>These national cost estimates for compliance with the turbidity requirementsmay be on the high side because the turbidity performance profile whichunderlies the analysis is based on survey results which embody a certainamount of statistical error. The foremost concern is that the survey soliciteddata on monthly average turbidity. Under the interim turbidity requirement,it is conceivable that there are many water systems that are monitoringwell enough to document they are below a 1 NTU monthly average, but notwell enough to document lower levels with precision. Measurement in the0.3 NTU range would require greater care. Thus, some of the systems believedto be above a monthly average of 0.3 NTU may require no more than bettermonitoring to demonstrate compliance.On the basis of data developed in a survey conducted by the American WaterWorks Association (AWWA, 1987), EPA estimates that approximately 1,163filtered surface water systems currently do not meet the disinfection performancerequirements of this final rule and will have to undertake modificationsto upgrade their disinfection practices. To meet the inactivation levels specified in the final rule, systems areexpected to choose from among several compliance options, including: andbullet; Increasing the chlorine or ozone dose; andbullet; Baffling clearwells; andbullet; Relocating the point(s) of ammoniation/chlorination; andbullet; Adding storage to increase disinfectant contact time; andbullet; Applying ozone or chlorine dioxide as alternate disinfectants;andbullet; Combinations of the above. From this mix of compliance options, assumptions were made regarding theones which will be selected by systems in different size categories, andthe average cost of compliance estimated. The results are presented inTable VI-4.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,s25,8</C><T4>Table </T4>VI-4._<T4>Costs of Upgrading To Meet Disinfection Performance Requirements</T4><H1>System size (by population served)</H1><H1> Costs  (andCx.11;/1,000 gallons)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">25 to 100<D>61</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101 to 500<D>22</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">501 to 1,000<D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 3,300<D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301 to 10,000<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001 to 25,000<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,001 to 50,000<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,001 to 100,000<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;100,000<D>1</D></ITAG></ITAG>E. BenefitsIn the November 3, 1987 proposal, EPA estimated there are between 212,000and 470,000 cases of waterborne disease annually in the United States amongpersons served by surface water systems, as described below.andbullet; First, EPA used data collected over a 15-year period by the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC) on the number of reported outbreaks (106) andthe number of cases of disease (34,436) to obtain an estimate of the averagenumber of illnesses per outbreak (325).andbullet; Second, to compensate for widespread underreporting in the numberof outbreaks, the reported number above (106) was multiplied by a factorof four.andbullet; Third, the adjusted number of outbreaks per year (424 dividedby 15) was multiplied by the average number of cases per outbreak (325)to obtain an estimate of the number of cases of disease per year attributableto waterborne disease outbreaks. EPA considered this result (9,183 casesof illness) the ``lower bound'' estimate.andbullet; Next, the ``upper bound'' estimate of cases of illness was calculated.To compensate for underreporting in the number of cases of illness in systemsserving 100,000 or fewer people, it was assumed that half of the populationexposed during an outbreak episode became ill. (This assumption replacedthe estimate of 325 cases of illness per outbreak.) Using this approach,the number of cases of illness per year was estimated to be 50,740.andbullet; In addition, for systems serving more than 100,000 people, itwas assumed that there would be two outbreaks per year_one in a large filteredsystem, and one in a large unfiltered system. Assuming an average of 6,000cases of illness per outbreak in large systems, based upon CDC data ofrecent record, EPA estimated that there would be 12,000 cases of illnessper year attributable to outbreaks in systems serving more than 100,000people.andbullet; Finally, the 50,740 and 12,000 cases, calculated above, were addedtogether to obtain a total of 62,740 cases of illness, taking into accountunderreporting of the number of cases.In addition to illnesses observed during an outbreak, there are waterborneillnesses occurring throughout the year, but not at sufficiently high ratesto attract attention as an outbreak. These endemic illnesses were estimatedusing a different methodology, as follows:andbullet; First, it was assumed that the rate of giardiasis in unfilteredsystems was similar to that observed in townships adjacent to Luzerne County,Pennsylvania, (i.e., one percent) at the time a significant outbreak occurredin 1983. For populations served by unfiltered systems, it was assumed thatthe rate ranged from a maximum of one percent to a minimum of one-quarterof one percent. For filtered systems, it was assumed that the rates werehalf those of unfiltered systems.andbullet; Next, EPA applied these rates to the population served by filteredand unfiltered systems to obtain an estimate of the upper and lower boundsof the number of endemic cases of illness per year (see Table VI-5).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,s10,6,5,10,6,6</C><T4>Table VI-</T4>5._<T4>Baseline Number of Endemic Cases per Year as Estimated in the DraftRegulatory Impact Analysis (USEPA, 1987c) </T4><H1>Endemic analysis </H1><H1>Assumed endemic rate</H1><H2>Lower bound </H2><H2>Upper bound </H2><H1>Population exposed </H1><H1>Lower bound endemic cases/yr </H1><H1>Upper bound endemic cases/yr</H1>Unfiltered systems:<ITAG tagnum="1">Large systems (andgreater;100,000) <D>0.0025 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>16,000,000 </D><D>40,000 </D><D>80,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Small systems (andgreater;100,000) <D>0.005 </D><D>0.01 </D><D>5,649,353 </D><D>28,247 </D><D>56,494</D><R>n,n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total, unfiltered <D> </D><D> </D><D>21,649,353 </D><D>68,247 </D><D>136,494</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Filtered systems:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Large systems (andgreater;100,000) <D>0.00125 </D><D>0.0025 </D><D>34,288,580 </D><D>42,861 </D><D>85,721</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Small systems (andless;100,000) <D>0.0025 </D><D>0.005 </D><D>36,764,700 </D><D>91,912 </D><D>183,824</D><R>n,n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total, filtered <D> </D><D> </D><D>71,053,280 </D><D>134,773 </D><D>269,545</D><R>n,n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total, filtered and unfiltered <D/><D/><D>92,702,633 </D><D>203,020 </D><D>406,039</D></ITAG></ITAG>andbullet; Finally, the lower bound estimates of cases of illness from outbreaks(9,183) and endemic illnesses (203,020) were added together to obtain thelower end of the range of illnesses (212,203). Doing the same for the upperbound estimates (62,740 + 406,039) resulted in an estimate of 468,779 totalcases of waterborne illness. Based on information submitted by several commenters, new data on theoccurrence of <T3>Giardia,</T3> and a revised methodology for the estimation of the numberof endemic cases of illness, these estimates have been substantially revised.EPA now estimates that currently there are approximately 89,000 cases ofwaterborne disease annually in systems using surface water. This figurewas derived as follows:andbullet; Using data on occurrence of <T3>Giardia</T3> in source water from Rose (1988) and estimates of treatmentefficiences, EPA estimated the present exposure to <T3>Giardia</T3> of people served by filtered and unfiltered systems indifferent size categories.andbullet; Next, these data were applied to a dose-response model (Rose,1988) to determine the daily individual risk of disease associated withthe above exposure.andbullet; The daily individual risk was then converted to an annual riskand applied to the population served to estimate the number of cases ofendemic illness per year from giardiasis in the absence of the treatmentrequirements of this rule.andbullet; Then, based on an analysis of the relative rates of all waterbornedisease, this value was adjusted upwards by 85 percent to take into accountdiseases other than giardiasis.andbullet; Finally, the number of cases of disease which will be avoidedby compliance with the rule was estimated based on the increase in removaland/or inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms expected from implementationof today's requirements.Using this methodology, EPA estimated that this final rule will prevent79,854 endemic cases of disease per year. In addition, 9,294 outbreak caseswill be avoided as a result of compliance with this rule. This number wasestimated using the same methodology employed in the draft Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (USEPA, 1987c) but is slightly higher (9,294 versus 9,183 forthe lower bound estimate) because of revisions to the data base since therule was proposed.The total number of cases avoided per year, 89,148, represents EPA's bestpoint estimate, or best single value, of the benefits of the rule. TheAgency also calculated an upper and lower bound, based on the 95 percentconfidence interval around the dose-response curve. By this method, thenumber of endemic cases could be as high as 149,181, or as low as 36,980.Thus, the total cases avoided per year could range from 46,274 to 158,475.In addition, EPA believes that many more cases than the number given maybe avoided by implementation of this rule because the number of cases peroutbreak is understated (it was not adjusted, as was done for underreportingin the number of outbreaks). By one account, the underreporting in casesper outbreak could be on the order of twenty-five times the actual levelsreported (Hauschild, A.F. and Bryan, F., 1980).EPA also examined the net benefits of installing filtration at the individualwater system level. Net benefits were analyzed for systems of various sizesby estimating the annual expected value of economic damages resulting fromvarious levels of endemic and outbreak disease incidence in communitiesof various sizes and subtracting the annual cost of installing filtration.It is important to note that it is difficult to estimate the value of thebenefits associated with reducing the endemic and outbreak incidence ofwaterborne disease, because there are many benefits which cannot be quantified.As described at length previously (USEPA, 1987c), EPA's analysis is structuredupon hypothetical assumptions which have been developed on the basis ofthe insights gained in two documented case studies: A 1981 outbreak ofviral gastroenteritis in Eagle-Vail, Colorado (Hopkins, 1986), and a 1983outbreak of giardiasis in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania (Harrington, 1985).The damage functions derived from these studies consist primarily of twotypes of costs: (1) Direct costs of medical treatment and the value oflost work, and (2) costs incurred due to ``averting behavior'' such asboiling water or purchasing bottled water undertaken in the event of anoutbreak. While it is difficult to generalize from the results of casestudies, it is currently the best means of estimating damages.Another shortcoming with the net benefits analysis at the time of proposal,and perhaps the biggest one, is the degree of uncertainty in the assumptionsmade regarding both the endemic and outbreak incidence of waterborne disease.It was estimated (Craun, 1987) that the annual probability of outbreakincidence in unfiltered surface water systems_averaging all such systemstogether_is roughly once in every one hundred years. Data with which toassess the endemic level of waterborne disease (the sub-outbreak, baselinelevel of disease) were not available at the time of the November 1987 proposal.Therefore, the net benefits analysis was conducted in a manner intendedto show what assumptions regarding the endemic level of disease would haveto hold true in order to produce net benefits near the margin (i.e., thepoint where net benefits approach zero), indicating that filtration isa breakeven or better proposition.In the draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (USEPA, 1987c), an assumption ofan endemic level of disease of 0.5 percent of the exposed population wasrequired to produce marginally positive or marginally negative net benefitsin the fifteen unfiltered systems serving more than 100,000 persons, assuminga one percent annual probability of an outbreak (once every 100 years).An endemic level assumption of 1.0 percent was required to produce marginallypositive or marginally negative net benefits in systems serving between1,000 and 100,000 persons. It was not possible to produce positive netbenefit estimates near the margin for systems serving fewer than 1,000persons. (Endemic level assumptions significantly above 1.0 percent wererequired; such levels would probably begin to become associated with epidemic,rather than endemic, incidence.)The breakeven assumptions regarding the probability of outbreak and theendemic level of waterborne disease were the subject of extensive commentson the proposed rule.Several large systems stated that the probability of outbreak, computedby averaging all unfiltered systems together, yields an estimate whichoverstates the risk of outbreak in large systems that have diligent watershedmanagement and disinfection programs. It has been contended that such systemscan reduce the risk of outbreak to a level comparable to that achievedby filtered systems (the reported outbreak risk in filtered systems is1/750 years according to Craun, 1987). This perception of outbreak riskin large systems is consistent with the rationale for providing criteriato avoid filtration for such systems in the proposed rule. On the otherhand, two systems among the fifteen unfiltered surface systems servingmore than 100,000 persons have experienced outbreaks since 1982, suggestingthere may be some large systems for which the probability of an outbreakis greater than 1/750.Many commenters expressed the view that the endemic levels of waterbornedisease assumed in the net benefits analysis (5andmultiply;10^3 for systemsandgreater;100,000; 1andmultiply;10^2 for systemsandgreater;100,000) are muchhigher than the levels actually occurring. As explained earlier, since publication of the proposed rule, new informationhas become available which has made it possible to assess the validityof the endemic level assumptions using a toxicological, or dose/response,approach to estimation. The average concentration of <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts in water sources with ``pristine,'' or protected,watersheds has been estimated to be 9andmultiply;10^3 cysts per liter (Rose,1988). An EPA study (USEPA, 1988a) of disinfection practices at unfilteredsystems shows that systems are currently achieving an average of 1.34 logsof inactivation. Thus, the implied average dose to consumers is 4andmultiply;10^4cysts/liter. A recently developed dose/response function (Rose, 1988) indicatesthat this exposure results in a daily risk of 1.65andmultiply;10^5 and isequivalent to an annual endemic rate of 3andmultiply;10^3. This estimatedaverage endemic level is relatively close to the range of 5andmultiply;10^3to 1andmultiply;10^2 originally assumed to be the endemic level in the netbenefits analysis at the time of proposal, lending support to the validityof the assumption. The above risk assessment indicates that unfiltered systems achieving averagelevels of inactivation may be facing greater risk of outbreak and incurringhigher levels of endemic disease than may be evident from the number ofcases reported. It should be noted however that, since this estimate isbased on average influent levels and average inactivation rates, actuallevels will vary. Systems achieving higher inactivation rates are probablycorrect in their assessment that they are not experiencing endemic levelson the order of 10^3 or 10^2. On the other hand, by definition, there alsois variation on the other side of the average estimate, indicating thatthere may be systems which are experiencing endemic levels higher than3andmultiply;10^3. In addition, it must be kept in mind that <T3>Giardia</T3> is not the only pathogen that contributes to the overallendemic incidence of waterborne disease. Data reported to the Centers forDisease Control indicate there are 0.85 cases of other types of waterbornedisease for every case of giardiasis. Thus, while it is true that somesystems are not experiencing the levels of outbreak risk and endemic incidencethat are associated with breakeven benefit/cost economics, it is also clearthat there are other water systems which may fall within the range of thebreakeven assumptions. Most importantly, there may be many water systemsin which it is not possible to make a definitive assessment of the risk.If the <T3>Giardia</T3> occurrence data presently available to EPA is representativeof unfiltered systems, the treatment requirements will, by requiring aminimum of 3-log removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia,</T3> reduce the maximum daily risk_the risk on days of peakoccurrence_to 4.56andmultiply;10^5; the average daily risk to 3.6andmultiply;10^7;and the average annual endemic level to 6.57andmultiply;10^5. These levelsprovide virtually complete assurance against outbreaks caused by <T3>Giardia</T3> cysts, as well as most other pathogens, and assure negligiblelevels of endemic incidence. A significant additional benefit of the treatmentrequirements, therefore, is the confidence derived from knowing they factorin an adequate margin of safety. As stated earlier, the estimated cost of this rule is approximately 50percent greater than that estimated at the time of proposal. When combinedwith substantially fewer cases of illness avoided, the net benefits forsystems in different size categories necessarily become less advantageousthan previously estimated. But the way to best generalize about the effecton public water systems is not unequivocal. On the one hand, an analysisfocusing on the typical system in each size category and using EPA's bestestimate of the benefits (Exhibit 5-10 of the Regulatory Impact Analysis)leads to the conclusion that household net benefits may be negative forcurrently unfiltered systems required to install filtration, possibly asmuch as $262 per household per year (in systems serving fewer than 100people). However, this interpretation is not entirely valid because thisresult applies to the typical system in each of these size categories,not to all systems. Moreover, the benefit analysis did not include allbusiness benefits; benefits accruing from the avoidance of pain and suffering;and benefits from reduced anxiety over the safety of the water. Since EPA'scalculation is only a partial measure of benefits it is reasonable to concludethat actual net benefits in all size categories may be greater. In addition,small systems unable to meet the criteria to avoid filtration would probablyinvestigate less expensive options than filtration, such as conversionto ground water or connection to a larger regional water system, whichwill increase the net benefits. Under SDWA, exemptions are also available.Under this provision, a system might use interim alternatives such as bottledwater and point-of-use devices, with State approval, thereby incurringlower compliance costs (at least temporarily), and thus experience concomitanthigher net benefits. In the case of systems which do not serve more than500 service connections and which need financial assistance for the necessaryimprovements, the SDWA permits the exemption to be renewed for one or moreadditional two-year periods if the system establishes that it is takingall practical steps and there is no unreasonable risk to health, therebyfurther reducing cost impacts. Another way of evaluating the benefits of these requirements is to considerthe percent of the population experiencing positive and negative net benefits.This is presented in Table VI-6. For the estimate of outbreak probabilitymost in keeping with available data (once in one hundred years), systemsserving approximately 90 percent of the population will achieve positivenet benefits, predominantly because currently filtered systems will incursmall costs to comply with the rule. In most of the remaining systems,customers will generally pay only up to about $20 more than the value ofthe benefits quantified. Less than one percent of the affected populationis expected to incur household net benefits of minus $40 or more, and thesewould only occur in systems serving fewer than 1,000 people. And thesepercentages would be even lower if all of the benefits had been capturedin the analysis, and alternatives to filtration considered.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,s25,10</C><T4>Table </T4>VI-6._<T4>Percent of Affected Population Incurring Varying Levels of Positiveand Negative Net Household Benefits Where the Probability of an Outbreakis 1/100 Years </T4><H1>Net household benefits ($/HH/Yr)</H1><H1>Approximate percent of the affected population</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Greater than 0<D>90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">^20 to 0<D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">^40 to ^20<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Less than ^40<D>andless;1</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Other Requirements</ITAG>A. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 602 <T3>et seq.,</T3> requires EPA to explicitly consider the effect of proposedregulations on small entities. If there is a significant effect on a substantialnumber of small systems, the Agency must seek means to minimize the effects.EPA has concluded that this final rule will not have a significant effecton a substantial number of small entities, for purposes of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.The Small Business Administration defines a ``small water utility'' asone which serves fewer than 50,000 people. There are about 199,000 publicwater systems using surface and ground water supplies which are consideredsmall systems under this definition. Of those, about 11,000 systems areexpected to incur total annualized costs of $333 to $439 million per yearto comply with the rule. Compared to total operating expenses of $14.7billion per year for this group, the cost of compliance amounts to an increaseof 2.3 percent to 3.0 percent over current operating costs. EPA believesthat an increase of this magnitude is not a substantial economic impactwithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. However, EPA recognizesthat today's action could have a substantial effect on some small systems.Therefore, the Agency has attempted to provide less burdensome alternativesto achieve the rule's goals for small systems wherever possible. To illustrate:andbullet; With respect to monitoring of the disinfectant residual at theentry point to the distribution system, systems serving fewer than 3,300people may take grab samples in lieu of using continuous-monitoring equipment;andbullet; With respect to disinfectant residuals in the distribution system,systems which are unable to maintain such residuals will still be consideredin compliance if the State determines that it is not feasible for thatsystem to monitor for HPC, and that disinfection is adequate, based ona review of site-specific considerations (e.g., source water quality, pastcoliform monitoring results);andbullet; With respect to the turbidity monitoring, for filtered systemsserving fewer than 500 people, the State may reduce the number of samplesto one per day if it finds that the historical performance and operationof the system indicates effective particle removal under the conditionsexpected to occur in that system.In addition, many of the provisions of this rule allow the State to modifythe stated requirements in appropriate cases, regardless of system size.Although not specifically aimed at reducing the burden on small systems,these systems may avail themselves of such flexibility in the same manneras their larger counterparts.B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> The information collection requirements are not effectiveuntil OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The public reporting burden on public water systems for this collectionof information is estimated to average 0.1 hours per response (i.e., sampletaken, or report submitted to the State or EPA), including time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''

These regulations establish criteria under which filtrationis required as a treatment technique for public water systems suppliedby a surface water source and public water systems supplied by a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water. In addition,these regulations establish treatment technique requirements in lieu ofmaximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants: <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3>, viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria,<T3>Legionella</T3>, and turbidity. Each public water system with a surfacewater source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surfacewater must provide treatment of that source water that complies with thesetreatment technique requirements. The treatment technique requirementsconsist of installing and properly operating water treatment processeswhich reliably achieve: (1) At least 99.9 percent (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of <T3>Giardia lamblia </T3>cysts between a point where the raw water is notsubject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstreambefore or at the first customer; and (2) At least 99.99 percent (4-log) removal and/or inactivation of virusesbetween a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination bysurface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer.(b) A public water system using a surface water source or a ground watersource under the direct influence of surface water is considered to bein compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:(1) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in andSection; 141.71and the disinfection requirements in andSection; 141.72(a); or (2) It meets the filtration requirements in andSection; 141.73 and the disinfectionrequirements in andSection; 141.72(b). (c) Each public water system using a surface water source or a ground watersource under the direct influence of surface water must be operated byqualified personnel who meet the requirements specified by the State.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 141.71</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria for avoiding filtration.</ITAG>A public water system that uses a surface water source must meet all ofthe conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and is subjectto paragraph (c) of this section, beginning December 30, 1991, unless theState has determined, in writing pursuant to andSection; 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii),that filtration is required. A public water system that uses a ground watersource under the direct influence of surface water must meet all of theconditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and is subject toparagraph (c) of this section, beginning 18 months after the State determinesthat it is under the direct influence of surface water, or December 30,1991, whichever is later, unless the State has determined, in writing pursuantto andSection; 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), that filtration is required. If the Statedetermines in writing pursuant to andSection; 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii) before December30, 1991, that filtration is required, the system must have installed filtrationand meet the criteria for filtered systems specified in andSection;andSection;141.72(b) and 141.73 by June 29, 1993. Within 18 months of the failureof a system using surface water or a ground water source under the directinfluence of surface water to meet any one of the requirements of paragraphs(a) and (b) of this section or after June 29, 1993, whichever is later,the system must have installed filtration and meet the criteria for filteredsystems specified in andSection;andSection; 141.72(b) and 141.73.(a)<T3> Source water quality conditions.</T3> (1) The fecal coliform concentrationmust be equal to or less than 20/100 ml, or the total coliform concentrationmust be equal to or less than 100/100 ml (measured as specified in andSection;141.74 (a)(1) and (2) and (b)(1)), in representative samples of the sourcewater immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant applicationin at least 90 percent of the measurements made for the 6 previous monthsthat the system served water to the public on an ongoing basis. If a systemmeasures both fecal and total coliforms, the fecal coliform criterion,but not the total coliform criterion, in this paragraph must be met.(2) The turbidity level cannot exceed 5 NTU (measured as specified in andSection;141.74 (a)(4) and (b)(2)) in representative samples of the source waterimmediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant applicationunless: (i) the State determines that any such event was caused by circumstancesthat were unusual and unpredictable; and (ii) as a result of any such event,there have not been more than two events in the past 12 months the systemserved water to the public, or more than five events in the past 120 monthsthe system served water to the public, in which the turbidity level exceeded5 NTU. An ``event'' is a series of consecutive days during which at leastone turbidity measurement each day exceeds 5 NTU.(b) <T3>Site-specific conditions.</T3> (1)(i) The public water system mustmeet the requirements of andSection; 141.72(a)(1) at least 11 of the 12 previousmonths that the system served water to the public, on an ongoing basis,unless the system fails to meet the requirements during 2 of the 12 previousmonths that the system served water to the public, and the State determinesthat at least one of these failures was caused by circumstances that wereunusual and unpredictable.(ii) The public water system must meet the requirements of andSection; 141.72(a)(2)at all times the system serves water to the public.(iii) The public water system must meet the requirements of andSection; 141.72(a)(3)at all times the system serves water to the public unless the State determinesthat any such failure was caused by circumstances that were unusual andunpredictable.(iv) The public water system must meet the requirements of andSection; 141.72(a)(4)on an ongoing basis unless the State determines that failure to meet theserequirements was not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the sourcewater.(2) The public water system must maintain a watershed control program whichminimizes the potential for contamination by <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses in the source water. The Statemust determine whether the watershed control program is adequate to meetthis goal. The adequacy of a program to limit potential contamination by<T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses must be based on: the comprehensivenessof the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to monitorand control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and theextent to which the water system has maximized land ownership and/or controlledland use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed control programmust:(i) Characterize the watershed hydrology and land ownership;(ii) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have anadverse effect on source water quality; and(iii) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effecton source water quality.The public water system must demonstrate through ownership and/or writtenagreements with landowners within the watershed that it can control allhuman activities which may have an adverse impact on the microbiologicalquality of the source water. The public water system must submit an annualreport to the State that identifies any special concerns about the watershedand how they are being handled; describes activities in the watershed thataffect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are expectedto occur in the future and describes how the public water system expectsto address them. For systems using a ground water source under the directinfluence of surface water, an approved wellhead protection program developedunder section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act may be used, if the Statedeems it appropriate, to meet these requirements.(3) The public water system must be subject to an annual on-site inspectionto assess the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process.Either the State or a party approved by the State must conduct the on-siteinspection. The inspection must be conducted by competent individuals suchas sanitary and civil engineers, sanitarians, or technicians who have experienceand knowledge about the operation and maintenance of a public water system,and who have a sound understanding of public health principles and waterbornediseases. A report of the on-site inspection summarizing all findings mustbe prepared every year. The on-site inspection must indicate to the State'ssatisfaction that the watershed control program and disinfection treatmentprocess are adequately designed and maintained. The on-site inspectionmust include:(i) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;(ii) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how wellit is protected;(iii) A review of the system's equipment maintenance program to ensurethere is low probability for failure of the disinfection process;(iv) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;(v) A review of operating procedures;(vi) A review of data records to ensure that all required tests are beingconducted and recorded and disinfection is effectively practiced; and(vii) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment,system maintenance and operation, or data collection.(4) The public water system must not have been identified as a source ofa waterborne disease outbreak, or if it has been so identified, the systemmust have been modified sufficiently to prevent another such occurrence,as determined by the State.(5) The public water system must comply with the maximum contaminant level(MCL) for total coliforms in andSection;141.63 at least 11 months of the12 previous months that the system served water to the public, on an ongoingbasis, unless the State determines that failure to meet this requirementwas not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the source water.(6) The public water system must comply with the requirements for trihalomethanesin andSection;andSection;141.12 and 141.30.(c) <T3>Treatment technique violations.</T3> (1) A system that (i) fails tomeet any one of the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sectionand/or which the State has determined that filtration is required, in writingpursuant to andSection;1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), and (ii) fails to install filtrationby the date specified in the introductory paragraph of this section isin violation of a treatment technique requirement.(2) A system that has not installed filtration is in violation of a treatmenttechnique requirement if:(i) The turbidity level (measured as specified in andSection;141.74(a)(4)and (b)(2)) in a representative sample of the source water immediatelyprior to the first or only point of disinfection application exceeds 5NTU; or(ii) The system is identified as a source of a waterborne disease outbreak.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;141.72</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Disinfection.</ITAG>A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not providefiltration treatment must provide the disinfection treatment specifiedin paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 30, 1991, unless theState determines that filtration is required in writing pursuant to andSection;1412(b)(7)(C)(iii). A public water system that uses a ground water source underthe direct influence of surface water and does not provide filtration treatmentmust provide disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (a) of thissection beginning December 30, 1991, or 18 months after the State determinesthat the ground water source is under the influence of surface water, whicheveris later, unless the State has determined that filtration is required inwriting pursuant to andSection;1412(b)(7)(C)(iii). If the State has determinedthat filtration is required, the system must comply with any interim disinfectionrequirements the State deems necessary before filtration is installed.A system that uses a surface water source that provides filtration treatmentmust provide the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (b) of thissection beginnng June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed,whichever is later. A system that uses a ground water source under thedirect influence of surface water and provides filtration treatment mustprovide disinfection treatment as specified in paragraph (b) of this sectionby June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed, whicheveris later.

Each day a system serves water to the public, the publicwater system must calculate the CT value(s) from the system's treatmentparameters, using the procedure specified in andSection;141.74(b)(3), anddetermine whether this value(s) is sufficient to achieve the specifiedinactivation rates for <T3>Giardia lamblia</T3> cysts and viruses. If a system uses a disinfectantother than chlorine, the system may demonstrate to the State, through theuse of a State-approved protocol for on-site disinfection challenge studiesor other information satisfactory to the State, that CT<T2>99.9</T2> values other than those specified in Tables 2.1 and 3.1 inandSection;141.74(b)(3) or other operational parameters are adequate to demonstratethat the system is achieving minimum inactivation rates required by paragraph(a)(1) of this section.(2) The disinfection system must have either (i) redundant components,including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-up and alarm toensure that disinfectant application is maintained continuously while wateris being delivered to the distribution system, or (ii) automatic shut-offof delivery of water to the distribution system whenever there is lessthan 0.2 mg/l of residual disinfectant concentration in the water. If theState determines that automatic shut-off would cause unreasonable riskto health or interfere with fire protection, the system must comply withparagraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.(3) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distributionsystem, measured as specified in andSection;141.74(a)(5) and (b)(5), cannotbe less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours.(4)(i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system,measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, asspecified in andSection;141.74(a)(5) and (b)(6), cannot be undetectable inmore than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutivemonths that the system serves water to the public.
