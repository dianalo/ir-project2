White, head of Eastman KodakCo.'s newest and most ambitious business venture, isn'teasily daunted.   Take the time he was giving a speech on electronic imagingat a recent computer trade show in New York. A power outagesuddenly left the room pitch-black, but Mr. White continuedspeaking, interjecting humorous anecdotes where slides weresupposed to be shown.</LP><TEXT>   That unflappable style, picked up during his days as aMarine lieutenant, should help him as he faces one of hismost challenging tasks: turning Kodak's disjointed and poorlyperforming electronic imaging business into a moneymaker. Mr.White was brought in as vice president, integration systems,late last year to integrate Kodak's computerbased products,such as scanners and printers, which were marketed separatelyby individual units.   If Mr. White is successful, the payoff could be enormous.By 2000, the electronic imaging industry is expected togenerate as much as $20 billion in annual sales. Moreover,the company's revenue from the imaging market is expected tosurpass Kodak's traditional business in photographic film andpaper.   The new marketing thrust is already paying off. Lastmonth, Kodak signed an agreement to provide InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. with imaging application software forIBM's PS-2 computer system. Industry observers termed theagreement a breakthrough for Kodak's electronic imagingbusiness.   Unlike chemical imaging -- such as photographic film andpaper, which are based mostly on silver-halide technology --electronic imaging uses electronic technology to store,retrieve and send images; it will be used in a number offields, from medicine to education and office management.   For the affable, 52-year-old Mr. White, a history buff whoseems more comfortable in jogging sweats than a businesssuit, the task of opening new markets for an emerging fieldcomes after a long stint in government.   As an assistant secretary of defense during the Carteradministration, Mr. White managed policies of the newall-volunteer army, playing a key role transforming themilitary from a draft system to a volunteer force. Also underPresident Carter, he served in the Office of Management andBudget as deputy director responsible for the Defense, State,Treasury and Labor departments' budgets. Mr. White waseventually awarded the Distinguished Public Service medal, anannual award given by the president.   He joined Kodak in 1988 after it acquired a Santa Monica,Calif., computer firm he headed, Interactive Systems. &quot;Thestakes are big in electronic imaging and that's anotherchallenge,&quot; he adds.   To illustrate the emerging technology, Mr. White likes todescribe a future hospital in which a New York patient'smedical history, X-rays and charts are stored in a computerelectronically. They can be called up instantly on a displayscreen and then transmitted to a Los Angeles hospital overthe telephone. &quot;It's the next information revolution,&quot; Mr.White asserts.   But putting together an electronic system won't be an easytask in tradition-bound Kodak, where departments and expertsin different areas were isolated from each other. &quot;Thisrequires a lot more cooperation among business units thanthey're used to,&quot; says Mr. White.   Moreover, Mr. White is one of the few outsiders amongveteran Kodak executives. &quot;It would have been harder if Icame in saying I understand photography,&quot; Mr. White says.&quot;But I came here with a computer industry view which Kodakdoesn't have much in the way of.&quot;   Until now, &quot;we've never had a central organization tointegrate these products,&quot; says Lawrence J. Matteson, generalmanager of Kodak's imaging information systems. JacquesKauffmann, president of Imaging Management andamp; Consulting Inc.,puts it more bluntly: &quot;They were going all over the place.&quot;   Although the photographic giant has developed someinnovative products in electronic imaging, such as a devicefor digitizing microfilm and the world's biggest capacityoptical disk, it hasn't been able to put together a completesystem.   That has contributed to the financial woes of the segment,which has yet to show a profit. Kodak, noting that electronicimaging is a &quot;business opportunity for the 1990s and beyond,&quot;admits to letting individual units become too independent.Counters Jack Ennis, who follows Kodak technology for ArthurD. Little Co., &quot;From a sales viewpoint, it's much moreattractive to market packages.&quot;   Mr. White says Kodak, like other computer companies, islearning that &quot;the future is going to require a lot ofintegration.&quot;   The biggest hurdle in his new job will be explainingelectronic imaging to the average person, he believes.&quot;People don't quite know what it is,&quot; he says. &quot;The excitingaspect of it is the possibilities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
