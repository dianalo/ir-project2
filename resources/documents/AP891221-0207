But a few minutes later, as she concentrated on her recollectionof him turning his head to the side, she remembered a gold earring.   That memory helped solve the case, says psychologist RonaldFisher, who interviewed her at the request of police. The payoffcame from an experimental technique called the cognitive interview,aimed at getting crime victims and witnesses to remember more thanunder standard police questioning.   The technique is one of several contributions psychologyresearchers hope will help solve crimes and convict criminals.   Much of this work has been done only in laboratories. But thecognitive interview recently showed promise in a real-world testwith detectives at the Metro-Dade Police Department in Miami.   It ``proved to be real fruitful,'' said police Sgt. Jim Wander.``The guys who took part in it are appreciative of the results, andI think they're probably better detectives overall as a result ofit.''   Results were reported in the October issue of the Journal ofApplied Psychology by Fisher and Michael Amador of FloridaInternational University and R. Edward Geiselman of the Universityof California, Los Angeles.   By analyzing interviews with robbery victims and witnesses, theyfound that seven detectives trained in the technique elicited 47percent more information than before training, and 63 percent morethan did nine untrained detectives.   The technique involves asking fewer questions than a standardinterview, putting more burden on the witness to actively generateinformation rather than simply respond to queries, Fisher said.   Among its strategies is to discern the witness' job or hobbyinterests, which might indicate details he is more likely torecall. A clothing designer might be able to describe in detailwhat a suspect was wearing, for example.   The witness is also asked to recall his emotions and thoughts atthe time of the crime, because studies suggest that will helprecollection.That can be tricky in the case of a victim who wasfrightened by the crime, Fisher said.   The interviewer also asks the witness what happened, not so muchto get information as to determine the witness' vantage point inseeing the crime and the ``mental pictures'' he has of it. The meatof the interview lies in asking the witness to recall the event,one mental picture at a time, and probe each picture for detail asit unfolds.   For example, if a suspect initially approached the witness andthen walked away, the witness should be asked about the suspect'sface only while recalling the approach. Questions about the back ofthe suspect's jacket should wait until the witness has moved on torecalling the departure.   The technique has ``a lot of promise,'' said Gary Wells,chairman of the psychology department at Iowa State University andthe author of a handbook on eyewitness identification for police.   But he and Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington havesome reservations. For example, the interview combines severaltechniques, and it is not clear which produces the results. Findingthat out might help researchers determine when to use the interviewand when not to, Wells said.   Loftus also questioned whether the extra details recalled duringthe cognitive interview are important. ``Some of them areimportant, some of them are not,'' replied Fisher. ``I go for allthe information I can get.''   Wells said more tests of the technique are needed.   Another line of memory research deals with the risk that avictim or witness will falsely identify an innocent person. Severalhundred people a year may be falsely convicted of felonies in theUnited States through erroneous identification, said KenDeffenbacher, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraskaat Omaha.   Laboratory experiments have shown two strategies useful inreducing the risk of false identifications in police lineups, Wellssaid. Lineups include a person suspected by police and severalpeople who generally resemble him.   In one strategy Wells studied, the witness is shown a ``blank''lineup which, unknown to him, does not contain any suspects. If hefingers somebody, he is discarded as unreliable.   In the other strategy, the witness is shown one person at a timeand asked if it is the right person. In the laboratory, thistechnique reduced false identifications by 20 percent to nearly 40percent, Wells said.   But Lt. Ron Lewis of the robbery-homicide division of the LosAngeles Police Department said he considered the ``blank'' lineupunnecessary because a regular lineup can already expose anerroneous witness if the witness fails to choose the suspect. Healso said the district attorney generally will not file a complaintagainst a person identified by only one witness; corroboratingevidence or multiple witness identifications are generally needed.   On another aspect of eyewitness reliability, studies show thatpeople do more poorly in identifying people of a different racethan of their own, said Florida State University psychologist JohnBrigham. His recent analysis of 14 studies involving blacks andwhites found the problem affected each race about equally. ``A lotof people had assumed that whites would do worse with blacks thanblacks would do with whites,'' Brigham said.   The reason for the problem is not clear. The observer's degreeof racial prejudice doesn't seem to make a consistent difference,and evidence suggesting the cause is lack of exposure to people ofa different race is ``pretty weak,'' he said. Maybe scientists needa better measure of exposure, including types of exposure, todemonstrate such a relationship, he said.   Brigham suggested that in appropriate cases, jurors be told ofthe hazards of cross-racial identification. He also recommendedthat lineups be arranged by an officer who is the same race as thesuspect and may be better able to choose people who resemble thesuspect, providing a fairer test of the identification. Policedepartments do not appear to do that generally now, he said.   Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Associationof Chiefs of Police, said he doubts such a practice would be widelyused because of the logistics of having enough officers of theproper race available.   Wells said that when he describes his lineup techniques and thecognitive interview while giving workshops to police, ``they arequite impressed with the kinds of findings that we're coming upwith.   ``I really think this is one of the areas of applied psychologythat is making a real contribution and a real difference.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 25</NOTE></DOC>
