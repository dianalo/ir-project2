Also Monday, a former hostage fought back tears as he recalledoffering to take his son-in-law's place when the hijackers tookseveral hostages off the plane in Beirut.   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger made no immediate ruling onlawyer Hans-Burkhardt Steck's request for a psychiatrist.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and airpiracy in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 after it left Athens forRome in June 1985. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39Americans were held hostage for 17 days.   Hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killingStethem.   Steck said Hamadi ``appears to be an adult in many things, but isa child that had been hindered in his development.''   He said Hamadi was ``mentally disturbed at the time of thehijacking'' but had wanted ``a bloodless hijacking.''   ``The mental and physical damage'' Hamadi had suffered fromfighting in Lebanon ``should have an influence on the sentence.''   While Steck spoke, the mother of the slain diver, PatriciaStethem, walked out of the courtroom, apparently fighting back tears.   She and her husband, Richard, have followed all 34 sessions sincethe trial opened July 5.   Later, American real estate developer Vincente Garza testifiedthat his son-in-law, Robert Trautmann, was among several hostagestaken off the plane at Beirut Airport and hidden in the city.   ``I thought he could be the first to be shot, and I asked Hamadi`don't take him away, take me.' Hamadi just pushed me back,'' saidGarza, 57, his voice cracking with emotion.   Another American testified that she feared the hijackers wouldharm her because she is Jewish.   ``I heard screams and beatings on more than one occasion,'' saidMauri Schwarz, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman. ``I was veryafraid because I am Jewish and I didn't know if they knew it.''   Ms. Schwarz said she saw one passenger ask for medical helpbecause he had a heart condition ``but the hijackers refused.''   Hamadi denied this when asked to comment.   ``If anyone had asked me for a doctor, I would have done that,''he said.   The court Monday completed cross-examining Dr. Burton Weber,whose testimony was interrupted Nov. 15 when Hamadi said he felt ill.   Weber said Hamadi appeared ``less wild and less mean'' than hisaccomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, who is a fugitive.   ``He (Hamadi) was not kind and nice and good, but in my mind hewas less frightening,'' Weber said.   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages donot reveal their hometowns.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after customsofficials found liquid explosives in his luggage.   The United States requested his extradition last year, but theWest German government turned it down, fearing for the lives of twoWest Germans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostages since have beenreleased.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prison termin West Germany in connection with the kidnappings.</TEXT></DOC>
