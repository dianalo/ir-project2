 Inference-based DataProcessing (IBDP), has emerged as a robust solution to these requirements.andM;IBDP consists of rule-based expert systems, object-oriented programming andstandard data processing technology.andP;  When evaluating inference-basedsoftware tools, a company should consider performance, flexibility,usability/power, integration and vendor strength.andM;Production Performance.andM;In an MIS environment, response time and resource utilization are alwaysimportant issues.andP;  To deliver production performance it is necessary to havecompiled, re-entrant machine code.andP;  Unfortunately, most inference-basedsystems produce an application that is interpreted.andP;  Some vendors haveprovided a high-performance option that will translate a knowledge base intore-entrant machine code resulting in a 10 to one performance improvement overinterpreted systems.andM;Development Model Flexibility.andM;Modern commercial applications are becoming more complex and need more than asingle method of problem solving, and are therefore best addressed by using avariety of integrated models and approaches.andP;  State-of-the-artinference-based tools provide flexibility to the developer through thesupport of rule processing, procedure processing, object processing,input/output processing and inference engine models.andM;A comprehensive hybrid tool should support goal-directed backward chaining;data-driven forward chaining; bidirectional chaining; object-oriented datastructures that simplify maintenance through specialization and inheritance;message passing; procedural techniques to provide control of applicationflow; and, extended data processing to include reports, graphs, messages andexternal databases.andP;  The more advanced tools also include knowledgehierarchies to facilitate structuring and partitioning of complex knowledgebases into manageable segments.andM;Usability and Power.andM;The raison d'etre of hybrid inference-based technology is to deliverproduction applications and therefore these tools must provide more than justa development language.andP;  They have to be able to span a spectrum ofapplications.andM;Powerful and complete inference-based tools provide facilities for changemanagement, multi-developer support, intelligent editors, powerful testingand debugging tools, keystroke-sensitive menus, design aids and integratedscreen/report formatting, enhancing the ability of the tool to deliverproduction applications.andM;Integration.andM;Inference-based technology needs to access or interface to externaldatabases, networks and more traditional tools like Cobol and fourthgeneration languages, thus mandating close integration betweeninference-based tools and the MIS environment.andP;  Leading tools provide awell-defined application programming interface (API) to facilitate theembedding of knowledge-based components within the scope of a largeapplication, and also automatically generate data structures and access code(DML) for external databases while extending the rules-based, object-orientedand procedural models to the data (e.g.andP;  a record can be an instance of classhierarchy with attached methods.)andM;With the proliferation of desktop workstations, the ability to develop anddeploy on disparate platforms using transparently portable knowledge bases iscrucial, as in Figure 3.andP;  For example, a developer could build a knowledgebase on a PC but deploy the appliction on a mainframe under MVS and DB2 wherethe corporate data resides.andP;  Co-operative processing provides a corporationwith even more flexibility to leverage desktop MIPS.andM;Vendor Strength and Commitment.andM;An inference-based development tool is only as good as the vendor that backsit.andP;  The availability of strong local support and education can be criticalto the success of a development project.andP;  Since no one buys execution-onlylicences until they have an application to deploy, a good measure of a tool'sand vendor's ability to deliver production applications is the number ofexecution systems deployed rather than development platforms.andP;  Your vendorshould have strategic partnerships in place with leading computer industrycompanies to ensure that the technology will exploit current and futurestandards and work with other industry solutions such as IBM's SystemsApplication Architecture, Common User Access and ApplicationDevelopment/Cycle initiatives.andM;Inference-based DP is a powerful technology that can help business addressthe complexity and changing requirements of applications in the '90s.andM;Andrzej Taramina is a senior account manager for Aion Corp. in Richmond Hill,Ont, and chairman of the newly-formed Canadian Information Processing Societyknowledge-based systems special interest group in Toronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
