We want to preserve it.''   Talmadge made the comments Tuesday after the EnvironmentalDefense Fund released a report alleging that the agency's bases inAntarctica are violating U.S. environmental laws and aninternational agreement governing use of the frozen continent.   ``The environmental practices of the NSF ... would not bepermitted anywhere in the United States,'' said the EDF, whichfrequently brings lawsuits against polluters in this country.   The group said the science agency is dumping untreated sewageand other wastes in Antarctic waters, engaging in open burning ofsome wastes and operating diesel power generators without emissionscontrols.   The report said McMurdo Sound, adjacent to the largest U.S.installation, is more polluted than virtually any U.S. waterway andthat highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals arebeing found in the tissues of penguins and seals.   ``It is incredible that these practices are observed by the U.S.government in the most pristine environment in the world,'' saidBruce Manheim, the report's author and an EDF attorney andscientist. ``Rather than addressing environmental threats inAntarctica, NSF has ignored them.''   Talmadge said that many of the report's findings are true, buthe said the agency is taking steps to improve environmentalpractices at its four bases.   NSF, which gets $125 million a year for its Antarcticactivities, is in the process of adopting an environmentalprotection plan and may ask Congress for cleanup money, accordingto Talmadge.   ``We have been doing pollution control, maybe not asaggressively as they'd like,'' he said, referring to the EDF. ``Wehave been undertaking extensive efforts to clean up since 1980.''   Talmadge said this year, NSF shipped 160 tons of scrap metal andmore than 500 drums of waste oil out of Antarctica. He said thosematerials are no longer dumped in the Antarctic waters.   He said the agency is reviewing a recommendation by an internalsafety panel that it stop using hazardous materials to ignitewastes in open-air burning pits. He said raw sewage is dumped intoAntarctic waters because officials believe it is less harmful thanthe chemicals that could be used to treat it.   The EDF report said the United States is not the only polluteramong the 18 nations with bases in Antarctica. It noted, however,that Australia and Japan remove all wastes from the continent andthat Poland and New Zealand treat sewage and control incineratoremissions.   The report said that if the United States did a betterenvironmental job in Antarctica, it ``would be in a much strongerposition to press for more comprehensive pollution control by lessresponsible nations.''   EDF said the NSF operations, which include 1,000 people atMcMurdo during the Antarctic summer months, violate U.S. lawsregulating ocean dumping and land disposal of waste materials.   The landfill at McMurdo does not comply with the internationalCode of Conduct on Waste Disposal adopted in 1975, according to thereport, which said NSF officials told a Senate panel last year thatit was ``in full compliance'' with the code.   ``We comply with most of the code except that provision,''Talmadge said. ``As far as we know, we are in compliance'' withU.S. laws, he said.   The report said NSF, despite a 1978 directive from Congress, hasfailed to assess the environmental impacts of its activities,including dynamite blasting and construction near Antarcticwildlife colonies.   ``In 1980 ... NSF promised to issue pollution controlregulations and to mitigate environmental impacts, but neither ofthese actions has ever been taken,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
