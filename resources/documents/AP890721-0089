STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On Budapest's busy Liberation Square,passers-by browse at a stand stacked with books and pamphletschronicling the Soviet suppression of the 1956 anti-Kremlinuprising in Hungary.   At a nearby state-run bookstore, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' thechilling account of Stalinist repression by Alexander Solzhenitsyn,the exiled Soviet Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is on prominentdisplay, along with the works of Hungary's most gifted oppositionwriters.   ``A year ago, we would have been hauled to the police station,interrogated, beaten and fined for this,'' said Zoltan Kurdi, adissident-turned-publisher who operates a small book stand onLiberation Square.   His selection contains memoirs of those who fought in thestreets in the 1956 uprising, works critical of Hungary's rulingCommunist Party, and Western accounts of life and politics inEastern Europe.   Buoyed by a new law that virtually eliminates all forms of pressand book censorship, Hungary's underground publishers haveabandoned their basements and attics for the streets andstorefronts.   They are being joined by an increasing number of privateentrepreneurs trying to cash in on a new and unfettered market,with official publishing houses also eager to compete.   Even state-run firms freely tout interpretations of the 1956revolt against Stalinism that contradict the long-held officialview that it was a counterrevolution.   Instead of smuggling them in from the West, Hungarians need onlywalk to their neighborhood bookstore for copies of George Orwell's``1984'' or ``Animal Farm'' and the works of distinguishedHungarians that were published only abroad for decades.   Even an essay by the founder of Socialist ideology, Karl Marx,has returned to the shelves, freed from a ban imposed because itstridently condemned censorship.   ``After 40 years of a controlled book culture, we are rapidlyentering an era of open and free book publishing,'' said PeterInkei, general director of the Ministry of Education and Culture'spublishing division.   ``Two years ago all this seemed like something that could onlyhappen in the very distant future,'' added Inkei, whose office oncewas responsible for red-flagging potentially troublesomemanuscripts for Central Committee censors.   The changes, like the bold overall reforms that made thempossible, have brought new challenges.   ``For years, the people who published underground literaturewere risking their freedom to fight cultural repression,'' saysKurdi, 24, whose group this year formed a limited publishingpartnership.   ``Now our biggest problem is to find ways of dealing withunscrupulous publishers and making sound business decisions to stayafloat.''   The publication of Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag Archipelago'' hascaused the most headaches for government officials and fledglingprivate publishers.   The Hungarian translation is a pirate edition, publishedprivately without the author's permission and in violation ofinternational copyright laws.   ``These people (the pirate publishers) are only motivated bygreed,'' fumed Kurdi, who said he and his friends had risked prisonfor years to bring out similar books at or below cost when therewas no other legal outlet.   Inkei said publication of ``Gulag Archipelago'' put thegovernment in a quandary.   ``If we had tried to ban it at first, we would have been accusedof trying to suppress it,'' said Inkei, whose office is moving toprohibit sale of the book because it violates Hungarian marketinglaws.   Inkei said his staff gets criticized by the 30 state-runpublishing houses for allegedly favoring the 100 or so new privatepublishers, who in turn have not forgotten that his office was onceresponsible for ``sniffing out trouble'' in submitted manuscripts.   ``We are now on the castle's ramparts, defending ourselves fromall sides,'' he said.   In the old days, he said, ``most books that intellectuals wantedto read were unavailable.''   Often, he said, proposed books were withdrawn quietly after hisoffice informed publishers that manuscripts had been earmarked for``consultations'' with the policy-setting Central Committee.   Inkei said his staff devotes its time to advising the governmenton publishing and tax laws and evaluating grant applications fromgovernment-owned and private publishers.   All could use the money.   ``Right now we're operating in the red,'' Kurdi said, surveyingthe array of once-outlawed books at his book stall.   ``We over-estimated the demand for books on the 1956 revolt,''he added. ``The market's glutted now and they're not moving veryfast.''   Warm summer weather also was hurting business, he said. ``Peopleare looking for light reading right now.''</TEXT></DOC>
