On other markets, cattle futures were mostly higher; stock-indexfutures fell sharply and precious-metals futures dipped as theprime lending rate rose; soybeans posted strong gains while grainswere lower; and energy futures advanced.   The rally in pork futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange waspowered mainly by technical buying based on traders' analyses ofprice charts, market analysts said.   For example, heavy buying occurred and selling interestevaporated each time the contract for June delivery of hogs movedabove Tuesday's high price of 51.97 cents a pound, said CharlesRichardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock andamp; Co.   On the fundamental side, some traders believed the annual dropin hog supplies had begun, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicagowith Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   More pigs are born in the fall than at any other time of year,and most of those animals have been sold for slaughter by latespring, Levitt said.   ``Since Monday, the hog flow has dried up considerably and somepeople feel this is the start of the seasonal move,'' he said.   The drop in supplies means higher prices but ``we can alsoexpect an increase in volatility,'' Levitt said. ``The size oftoday's advance is already giving us a prelude to that.''   Cattle futures advanced in line with higher cash prices buttraders were cautious about establishing new positions ahead ofMonday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the AgricultureDepartment, analysts said.   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .62 cent higher with thecontract for delivery in June at 73.42 cents a pound; feeder cattlewere .20 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 80 cents apound; hogs were .32 cent to 1.38 cent higher with June at 52.77cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.75 centshigher with May at 53.07 cents a pound.   Stock-index futures plunged along with stock prices as big banksraised their prime lending rates from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. Itwas the first increase in the closely watched rate since theOctober stock market crash.   Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange registered early losses in reaction to a sharpdrop in worldwide stock prices caused by interest rate fears,analysts said.   The second jolt came at midday when U.S. banks began announcinghigher prime lending rates.   ``The market did not react well to the increase in interestrates,'' said Robert Ray, an analyst in Chicago with Dean WitterReynolds Inc.   The contract for June delivery of the Sandamp;P 500 index settled 5.20points lower at 253.40.   The precious-metals markets also registered disappointment atthe rise in interest rates but they absorbed the news in a matterof hours, then began moving higher and finished nearly unchanged.   ``The markets were aware that beyond the negatives of a higherprime rate is the feeling that it fuels inflation, and that'sbullish for the precious metals,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metalsanalyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 40 cents loweracross the board with June at $451.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8cents to 2 cents lower with May at $6.552 a troy ounce.   Soybean futures prices soared as much as 9{ cents a bushel onthe Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the AgricultureDepartment's latest supply and demand report. Grain futuresretreated slightly.   The surge in soybean prices was expected after the USDA, in areport Tuesday afternoon, predicted the U.S. soybean stockpilewould dwindle from 275 million bushels this Aug. 31 to 145 millionbushels a year later.   The report was seen as neutral for corn futures, which finishedmodestly lower in Wednesday's session.   The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest wouldbe about 4 percent larger than last year's and that predictionweighed on wheat futures Wednesday, analysts said.   Wheat settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $3.03 abushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with May at $1.97 abushel; oats were 3\ cents to 3} cents lower with May at 1.58{ abushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9{ cents higher with May at $7.12a bushel.   Energy futures prices were mostly higher in quiet trading on theNew York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline made the greatestgains because of a report showing heavy drawdowns of supplies overthe past week, analysts said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 centshigher with June at $17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent lowerto .44 cent higher with June at 47.46 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .20 cent to .63 cent higher with June at 52.25 cents agallon.</TEXT></DOC>
