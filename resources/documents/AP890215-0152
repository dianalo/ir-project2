(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only three people have turned in assaultrifles to police since the City Council banned the semiautomaticweapons following a schoolyard rampage in which a gunman killed fivechildren, authorities said.   The ban on a variety of assault weapons began Tuesday, one weekafter the council passed it unanimously.   Police Lt. George Lerner said that although only three residentshave given assault rifles to police, others are selling their gunsor storing them outside the city to comply with the law.   ``Certainly, we'd like to see them off the streets altogether,but they have alternatives to stay within the law,'' Lerner said.   The ban was in response to the Jan. 17 attack in which PatrickEdward Purdy sprayed his AKM-47 at Cleveland Elementary Schoolstudents, killing five youngsters and wounding 30 other people. Hethen took his own life.   Some gun shop owners said people won't give the guns to policebecause the weapons are expensive, starting at around $300.   ``Nobody is going to turn them in to the cops,'' said TimCassidy, owner of Cassidy's Pawn Shop. ``They'll just take them intoan area where it's still legal to have them.''   Several Stockton gun dealers sold their stocks of semiautomaticweapons to retailers outside the city, and some said they stored theguns with other dealers because of the possibility that the ban willbe overturned in court.   Stockton's ban, similar to one under study by the stateLegislature, prohibits possession or sale of semiautomatic rifleswith detachable magazines that hold 20 or more rounds and aredesigned for military purposes.   The ordinance also applies to some semiautomatic shotguns andpistols.   Violators can be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a $500fine.   A similar ban has been adopted in Los Angeles, 325 miles south ofStockton.</TEXT></DOC>
