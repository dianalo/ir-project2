These measurements provide useful information for the assessmentof cardiac performance. Systolic cardiac performance is determined byfour major factors: (1) frequency of contraction, (2) preload, (3) afterload,and (4) contractile state. For clinical assessment of cardiac hemodynamicsthese determinants are often represented by (1) heart rate, (2) leftventricular end-diastolic volume, (3) systolic arterial blood pressureor systemic vascular resistance, and (4) ejection or pre-ejection phaseindices of the rate or degree of cardiac pressure or volume change. Inorder to further characterize the contractile state of the left ventricle,radionuclide ventriculography may be used to measure noninvasively leftventricular volumes. The rational for making such measurements is discussed,as are the methods employed. Practical clinical aspects of these measurementsare to be considered. Finally, the use of indirect radionuclide measuresof left ventricular filling pressure are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
