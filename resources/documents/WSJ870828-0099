The legislation, which is expected to be passed by Parliament today, would require an immediate return to work by more than 47,000 employees of government-owned Canadian National Railways and CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. The legislation would require workers to begin reporting to work tomorrow.    The strike, now in its fifth day, has paralyzed the country's rail and passenger traffic. About 30% of Canada's freight, including most grain, potash, sulfur and forest products, is shipped by rail. Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux said that if the strike were allowed to continue it would be &quot;disastrous&quot; for the economy.    The legislation will provide binding arbitration to settle the contract. The main outstanding issues involve job security. William Kelly, the government's senior mediator who was called in Monday in a final negotiating attempt, called off the mediation effort yesterday morning, saying the two sides were refusing to move on major issues.    The back-to-work legislation had been urged by farm groups, manufacturers and others. The strike has already caused plant closedowns and layoffs across Canada. A spokesman for the Canadian Manufacturers' Association said, &quot;Any rail strike that goes beyond a week would just be devastating.&quot;    Canadian National and CP Rail, in a joint statement, said the failure to obtain a negotiated settlement was &quot;a bitter disappointment.&quot; An industry source said one of the major unresolved issues was the railroads' demand to eliminate staffed cabooses.    A union spokesman said the nine rail unions involved in the dispute would comply with any return-to-work legislation. The unions have been negotiating jointly with the railroads.    The bill permits the previous contract to be extended for two years from its Dec. 31, 1986, expiration date. The last rail strike, which also was terminated by back-to-work legislation, occurred in 1973.    Mr. Cadieux said he decided to intervene in the current dispute when it became apparent that there was &quot;no reasonable prospect for a settlement.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Canadian Pacific closed at $20.625 a share, unchanged.    In another labor development, the 23,000-member Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents letter sorters and other indoor postal workers, said its members voted 75% in favor of strike action, if necessary, to support the union's contract demands. The union has been without a contract since Dec. 31.    Jean-Claude Parrot, the union's president, said he expects that the membership will be legally entitled to strike about Sept. 20. He predicted a walkout will occur if Canada Post, a government agency, doesn't abandon its demands for union concessions on job security.    The country's postal service was disrupted earlier this summer by three weeks of rotating strikes by the Canadian Letter Carriers' Union in support of contract demands. A settlement in the letter carriers' dispute was reached July 5. </TEXT></DOC>
