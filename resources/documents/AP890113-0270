Perez is promoting a summit of OPEC heads of state to ease theinternal political tensions that have eroded the cartel'seffectiveness in controlling the world oil market.   Although Perez is still in an unofficial capacity, his scheduledvisit next week to both Baghdad and Teheran is the first by a toplevel representative of a non-Arab member of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries since Iran and Iraq agreed last yearto end their eight-year war.   Perez' brief talks will follow a day of discussion in Zurich withOPEC Secretary General Subroto, who was instrumental in getting Iranto agree to allow Iraq to produce the same amount of oil as Iran inthe cartel's new output quota system. The accord, signed inNovember, reduced OPEC's oil production by 4 million barrels to 18.5million barrels a day starting Jan. 1 and extending for six months.   ``He will be discussing petroleum, international cooperation,South-South relations, and of course the (OPEC) summit,'' Perezpress spokesman Pastor Heydra said.   Perez is scheduled to meet with Subroto on Sunday in Zurichbefore leaving for Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a visit to promotebilateral cooperation and trade.   He will stop in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates beforemoving on to Teheran next Tuesday and Bahrain and Baghdad onWednesday.   Perez visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Algeria last December todrum up support for the summit. Arab members of OPEC have been coolto the idea.   Indonesia has expressed support for a summit in 1990, the year ofOPEC's 30th anniversary. The cartel's 20th anniversary summit,scheduled for 1980 in Baghdad, was cancelled because of the Gulf war.   Perez is also promoting a summit of Latin American nations topressure for better conditions to repay the region's foreign debt ofover $400 billion.   Perez' inauguration ceremony Feb. 2 will be attended by 21 headsof state, including Fidel Castro. Unofficially, several OPECministers, including Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer, may also attend,Venezuelan officials said.   The inauguration will be followed by an informal meeting amongthe region's top debtors to discuss a Perez proposal for a ``commonframework'' for future debt negotiations.   Among the biggest debtor nations _ Brazil, Mexico and Argentina _only Mexico is not sending its president. Venezuela is the region'sfourth largest debtor.   This week in New York Venezuela began talks with major creditorsto refinance most of its $33 billion foreign debt.</TEXT></DOC>
