Likethe British of India or the Portuguese of Mozambique, some ofwhom never saw London or Lisbon, 26 million Russian colonialshave lost their authority, are losing their work and may facethe loss of their homes.   &quot;When the Latvians fought for independence, they wantedour support,&quot; says Katya Borshchova, an editor, born in Riga,whose Russian father was an officer of the occupying army.&quot;But now even good Russians aren't acceptable. It's us andthem. Three years ago, I felt the pain and hurt of theLatvian nation. Now, I feel nothing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The Russians are in shock,&quot; a Latvian says. &quot;Moscow,&quot;says another, &quot;isn't answering their letters anymore.&quot;   Near the center of Riga, an old Cold War bomb shelter,covered in grass, squats in an apartment-house courtyard. Adoor leads to a dank, sunken room crammed with shoe boxes,sweaters, sacks of leather scraps and rolls of cottonticking. Space has been cleared for a small counter. This isMikhail Litviniuk's office.   He is 28, blond and Slavic-eyed. Ten years ago, hemigrated to Riga from Siberia. &quot;It's mostly Russians inbusiness here,&quot; he says. &quot;We're doing commerce.&quot; He is buyingup goods, that is, and waiting to sell when the price isright. Mr. Litviniuk would like a decent office, but he hasgot nowhere with Riga's authorities. A bomb shelter is thebest he can do.   &quot;It's prejudice,&quot; he says. &quot;I can feel it.&quot; Civil-defensecartoons taped to the concrete wall behind him show B-52sdropping bombs and mushroom clouds rising. &quot;Russians are likeworms. We can live anywhere. But it turns out I may not beable to own property. I may not be a citizen.&quot;   &quot;No place to invest money,&quot; says his partner, Igor Ivanov,squeezing around a stack of shoe boxes to lean on thecounter. &quot;It will never be too late to go back to Russia.&quot;   &quot;But I wanted to be a Latvian,&quot; Mr. Litviniuk says.   In the mid-1970s, a pop tune promoted the myth of theSoviet melting pot. &quot;My address is not a house,&quot; went thewords. &quot;My address is the Soviet Union.&quot; Few believed it, butthe Russians sent out to the republics to ensure Moscow'srule found life better there and gladly stayed. Now,abruptly, they have all had a change of address. DespiteBoris Yeltsin's assurance of granting them Russiancitizenship, going home is their worst fear.   Yet in the independent republics, &quot;Russians go home&quot; isthe new pop refrain. Russians in Moldova are picking up gunsto defend their turf. In the Crimea, an appendage of Ukrainewhere Russians hold a majority, a move is on to pledge fealtyto Moscow. And here, Russians are at the short end of aLatvian campaign to erase 50 years of unwilling&quot;Russification.&quot;   Before the Soviet Union annexed Latvia in 1940, a tenth ofthe republic's population was Russian. Death and deportationpared the Latvians to 1.4 million by 1945, and there theyremained. Between 1946 and 1988, 940,000 Russians poured in,plus 400,000 Slavs who spoke Russian. They dominated thearmy, ran the bureaucracy, managed and manned the factoriesand cornered the best apartments. Latvians drew closer thanany people in the empire to becoming a minority in their ownland.   In October, a month after independence, Latvia'slegislature moved to &quot;liquidate the consequences&quot; of theannexation. It adopted guidelines for possible future lawsthat would deny citizenship to former Communists and retiredarmy officers, to anyone who can't speak Latvian, and toanyone who has lived here fewer than 16 years. For Russians,whether they qualify or not, the message is brutal.   &quot;They were always the winners, they `freed' us,&quot; a Latviansays derisively. &quot;If they don't like it, let them leave.&quot;   The cultural abyss cuts deep. Latvians had to learnRussian, so even Russians who married them rarely learnedLatvian. Russians and Latvians go to separate schools.Russian children call Latvian children fascists; Latvianchildren call Russian children occupiers. Russians likecloseness and hyperbole; Latvians like distance andunderstatement. A drunken Russian tells stories to strangers;a drunken Latvian sings. Russians hang rugs on their walls;Latvians think that's boorish. Latvians love choral music;Russians think that is a bore.   At the Latvian Movement for National Independence,Visvaldis Lacis has finished speaking, in Russian, with somevisiting Hungarians.   &quot;The language of empire,&quot; he says as they leave. He hasbeen a dissident for 45 years. Not long ago, the group heheads was on the fringe. Now, its legalistic views oncitizenship have been embraced by the People's Front,Latvia's largest mass organization.   &quot;We have our prewar constitution,&quot; Mr. Lacis says, inEnglish this time. &quot;We will elect our parliament, and it willdecide the fate of the Russians.&quot; Only those with Latvianroots should be fit to vote, he insists. &quot;Are Germanscitizens of Greece, of France? Russians are not citizens. Wedidn't ask them to come. It is not legal entry when you areoccupied, arrested, shot, deported.&quot;   What would he do about Russians who are here nevertheless?   &quot;Stimulate voluntary repatriation. Otherwise, we Latvianswill see the death of our identity.&quot;   Cyrillic signs are coming down around Riga as the Russiansawait their fate. Latvian is the one official language now.Parliament has pulled the plug on interpretation for Russiandeputies, who have had to finance a service of their own.Russians who can't understand local television tune to Moscowinstead.   Stopped from teaching in their language, Russianphysicists from the Academy of Sciences have opened a privatecollege in a vacated military college. At state enterprises,where much of the work force is Russian and much of the workis military, accounts and documents all must be in Latvian.And Russian managers are getting the ax.   &quot;Under Soviet rule,&quot; Anatoly Belaychuk is saying, &quot;I heldsecret information. I had no right to contact Westerners.Now, they say I'm too close to Moscow to start a Westernjoint venture.&quot;   Two years ago, he became Latvia's civil aviation chief.Today, he sits in his high-ceilinged apartment, out of a job,having a cup of tea and a Marlboro. He was banging out a dealto create a Latvian airline, along with Westerners and avariety of Slavs, until August's coup. Free Latvia's leadersthought a national airline should be more than half-owned bya nation. They axed Mr. Belaychuk.   &quot;It was all an excuse to get me out,&quot; he says. &quot;They couldnever forgive me for belonging to the Communist Party. Ialways said secession would bring disaster. I thought the wayGorbachev did.&quot;   When he was five, in 1944, Mr. Belaychuk was brought toRiga, where his father worked on the military railroad. Hehas lived here since, never quite mastering Latvian; hisfather is buried here. He doesn't know where to go now.   &quot;I've got ideas that are in great demand in Kazakhstan,&quot;he says. &quot;I could go to Ukraine, to Russia. In Latvia, I haveno trust for democracy. My family always thought we were heretemporarily anyway. We never bought a dacha.&quot;   Mr. Belaychuk had his counterparts in every republic. Hewas one of Moscow's foot soldiers, the closest the systemcame to nullifying nationalism and forging a &quot;Soviet Man.&quot;Not all were Russians. Latvia had its own Soviets: ViktorAlksnis, the colonel who cried for a crackdown; party bossAlfreds Rubiks, who greeted the coup with &quot;joy and pride&quot;;Boris Pugo, the interior minister who killed himself when itflopped.   Nor were all Soviets big shots. Doormen, waiters and everypetty functionary who passed out socialism's candy fit thedescription. In a different way, so did the thousands whoseitinerant lives afforded no other identity to choose from.Esmira Timofeyev is one of them.   She sits shyly at the end of a food-heaped coffee table inher parents' living room. On the couch sit her parents:Galina Sviklis was born to an Azerbaijani father and aRussian mother in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan's Armenianenclave. Victor Sviklis, a pure Latvian, joined the army in1952, and served for 33 years in Lithuania, East Germany,Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkmenia, Egypt, Leningrad and Russia'sFar East; he came home to retire.   Their daughter, born in East Germany 30 years ago, livednearly everywhere her parents did. She came to Latvia withthem and married Vasily Timofeyev, who was born here ofBelarussian parents. He sits by her side now, eating a sliceof stuffed carp Azerbaijani style.   &quot;Of course I'm not Latvian,&quot; he says in Russian. &quot;I'm notRussian, too. What am I?&quot; he asks his wife. &quot;What are you?&quot;   &quot;I don't know what I am,&quot; says Mrs. Timofeyev. &quot;I'vealways joked about it. I was taught that there is a Sovietpeople, that my homeland is the whole Soviet Union. I wasn'tborn in Latvia. I spent my childhood in the Ukraine. I don'thave that Latvian mentality. My father is very troubled aboutit.&quot;   She is speaking Russian, too, and her father looks pained.   &quot;There's something not quite genuine about me,&quot; she says.&quot;Everyone belongs somewhere, but I can't feel it. I'm notUkrainian or Latvian or Russian. What does independence mean?Independent from where? Independent from what?&quot;   If Latvia models its citizenship law on the guidelinesalready set down, Mrs. Timofeyev would qualify through herLatvian father, but her mother and husband may not; theirabilities in the national language could be too weak. SomeLatvians think that's cruel.   &quot;Russians strive for the same goals we do,&quot; a young womansays. &quot;You can't alienate them all. It's racist.&quot; But Latvianmoderates lack a political voice. &quot;Extremists organizedfastest,&quot; says Alex Grigorievs, a member of parliament whohas a Latvian mother and a Russian father. &quot;In the center, wehave a vacuum.&quot;   So do the Russians. They have no political party. Theironly advocates are the former Communists left in parliamentwho may be less intent on stemming hatred than stirringhysteria. Reborn as rights activists, the old comrades havecomplained to Helsinki Watch and plan to alert the UnitedNations. One of them, Gennady Romashov, says Latvia isbecoming &quot;a totalitarian regime with an ethnic ideology.&quot;   But some Russians may be more unequal than others. TheSoviet Union reversed the patterns of empires past: Ratherthan import raw material and cheap labor, it exported both.Thousands of Russians earn their keep in Latvian factories.Technocrats and managers might flee as economic doom closesin, but workers could lose not only a job but also the rightto stay in the only place they call home.   At the hostel in one of Riga's seedier parts, a Latvianwoman answers the knock on her door. Do any Russians livehere? &quot;Yes,&quot; she says, &quot;too many.&quot; She leads the way toanother door along a pitch-black hallway. Under the linoleum,something smells rotten.   A sleepy Russian man responds to the knock and lets astranger into a small room warmed by body heat. It has threebeds and three cribs, a clothesline, and cupboards stuffedwith toys, pots and pans, hair curlers. Three young women inhouse robes hold three squirming babies. Another man is deadasleep on a bed.   &quot;We were wanted here when we came,&quot; says Natalya. Her babygrabs a plastic horn and toots it. &quot;Now we're immigrants. Wehad a hope of buying an apartment. Now it's all ruled out. Wehave no right for anything.&quot;   The women, one a single mother, are on maternity leave;they all make microchips at the factory that owns the hostel.They won't give their last names because the two husbands arein Latvia illegally. If the country goes through with itscitizenship law, all eight in this room will fail the test.The women know it, and they are scared.   &quot;The layoffs have already started,&quot; Irena says. &quot;If welose our jobs, we have to get out of the hostel. We couldlose our right to live in Latvia. We could have no place togo.&quot;   &quot;If I had a place to live in Russia, I'd go back,&quot; Natalyasays. &quot;Of course, I'd be sorry to leave. I did find somethinghere. It happens, you know. People can find happiness inforeign places.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
