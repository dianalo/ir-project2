Silverman's comments were echoed by others as the FourthInternational Conference on AIDS, the largest AIDS meeting everheld, ended last week.   Seven-thousand researchers from 140 countries had met to poreover 3,200 research reports on acquired immune deficiency syndromeand its cause, the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.   ``More people are studying HIV than any other virus,'' saidDavid Baltimore of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.   AIDS research ``is a growth industry,'' said Silverman. ``AndI'd like to think with all that dedication there will be somebreakthroughs.''   No breakthroughs were announced in Stockholm.   Bo Oberg of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said more than50 experimental drugs were under development as possible AIDStreatments.   ``It's hopeful that a large number of compounds are comingalong,'' he said, ``but it's going to be complicated to evaluatethem.''   As of June 1, the World Health Organization had received reportsof 96,433 AIDS cases from around the world, double the numberreported at the time of the Third International Conference on AIDSheld in Washington, D.C., a year ago.   Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's AIDS program, estimated thatthe actual number of AIDS cases in the world was closer to 150,000,and that another 150,000 cases would occur this year.   At least 5 million people are infected with the AIDS virus andas many as several hundred million people are engaging in behaviorthat puts them at risk of AIDS, Mann said.   In the United States alone, new AIDS cases are being reported atthe rate of one every 14 minutes, said Dr. James Curran of the U.S.Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.   Curran, who updates the U.S. statistics each year at theinternational AIDS conference, seemed painfully aware of the humantoll that those figures represent. ``It's getting harder everyyear,'' he said.   Standing in the cavernous main hall at the Stockholm conventioncenter, Curran looked up at two enormous quilts suspended from theceiling, each with a score of panels bearing the names of AIDSvictims. ``It's even harder to have the predictions turn outright,'' he said.   The AIDS research effort has matured, Curran said, providing asolid foundation of knowledge on the virus and the epidemic. But hesaid thornier questions remain to be answered.   ``More people are getting involved in prevention and behaviorresearch, but still not enough,'' he said. ``There's a gap inunderstanding of sexual behavior and intravenous drug abuse.''   Such research is crucial because, as a Swedish AIDS publicationsaid last week, ``knowledge is the only vaccine we have.''   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, remains the only drugthat's been shown to improve the lot of people with AIDS _ or PWAs,as they're often called.   With AZT, ``we've improved the quality of life and extendedsurvival,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami.She, too, said she was disappointed by the pace of drug research.   Dr. Samuel Broder of the National Cancer Institute, a leader inthe U.S. government's effort to devise newer and safer AIDS drugs,had a different view.   ``There is more drug development and more progress against theAIDS virus than against any other virus known,'' he said. Half adozen drugs look especially promising and are under intensivedevelopment, he said.   The disappointment that some researchers expressed reflected ``asense of frustration, of the urgency of the problem,'' he said.   ``We all have a sense of urgency to come up with safe andeffective ways of handling the AIDS virus. As long as we have onepatient who will die of AIDS, we haven't made enough progress.''   If the development of drugs to treat AIDS is tough, thedevelopment of a vaccine to prevent AIDS is tougher still. Dr.Jonas Salk, the polio vaccine pioneer, and Dr. Daniel Zagury, thecourageous French researcher who in 1986 injected himself with anexperimental AIDS vaccine, both reported encouraging plans _ andlittle progress _ toward an AIDS vaccine.   Attempts to vaccinate chimpanzees against AIDS have largelyfailed, various researchers reported.   ``We should not despair,'' said Reinhard Kurth of the PaulErlich- Institute in Frankfurt, West Germany. ``Many avenues havenot been tried yet.''   One important development welcomed at the conference was thefinding that a new AIDS test called the polymerase chain reactiontest, or PCR, is apparently much more sensitive and accurate thanany existing test.   The test, which can detect even very small amounts of the AIDSvirus, will assist researchers studying the development of AIDS ininfected individuals.   And if its effectiveness is confirmed in subsequent studies, thetest may be critical to the detection and treatment of AIDS ininfants, researchers said.   Infants born to infected mothers carry AIDS antibodies that theyhave acquired in the womb, but not all actually acquire the virus.Yet because all of them have antibodies to the virus, antibodytests cannot reveal which are infected and which aren't.   The PCR could provide the first definitive diagnosis of AIDS ininfants. The number of such unfortunate babies is growing, as AIDSspreads among drug abusers.   This year's AIDS conference was somewhat unusual in thatparticipants were regularly reminded that the object was to curesick people _ not merely to advance an intellectual enterprise.   Many medical conferences are rather impersonal affairs, in whichscience is discussed on a lofty plane and the immediate concerns ofpatients are left to another place and time.   At this conference, however, a variety of talks dealt with theimportance of taking care of patients.   ``I've been critical of some meetings in the past, becausepatient care hasn't been important,'' said Dr. Constance Wofsy ofSan Francisco General Hospital. ``And I think that's important.''   Dr. Anthony Pinching of St. Mary's Hospital Medical School inLondon brought the concerns of patients to center stage,emphasizing that doctors have much to learn from them.   ``They are the most important teachers,'' Pinching said, ``andif we listen, there is hope.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 19</NOTE></DOC>
