Its left front door won't close, and the plant managers have displayed it to make a point: Faulty doors should be corrected before vans leave the assembly line.    &quot;A few years ago, this would have triggered a delegation of 20 people in my office complaining about intolerable pressure,&quot; says Michel Challande, a Renault department chief. Pausing under a sign reading &quot;Quality isn't an option,&quot; he adds: &quot;Now, I've finally got my hands free to manage.&quot; He points proudly to a new chart showing that his assembly line topped its quality goals for the first time in years.    Mr. Challande's newfound freedom to spur his work force is symptomatic of many changes that have transformed Renault, and much of French industry, over the past five years. Battling competition within Europe, from the United States and from Japan and tiring of horrendous losses at many state-owned companies, France has discovered the bottom line.    Nowhere is the change more striking than at Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, which this year expects to earn at least one billion francs ($165 million), following losses of 30 billion francs over the past six years. Renault says its turnaround was faster and bigger than Chrysler Corp.'s. It was certainly more surprising.    However, it has been based more on cost cutting than on a true long-range strategy, skeptics say, and they doubt that what has been achieved is much more than a first step toward rehabilitation.    &quot;The real question,&quot; says Donald L. Kress of Booz, Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc., a consulting firm, &quot;isn't how well you're doing today against your own history but how you're doing against your competitors.&quot; Renault is &quot;still last in a very fast race,&quot; he adds.    Nonetheless, the company has changed greatly. For four decades, it was operated as a social laboratory where making profits didn't count. Until three years ago, managers couldn't fire workers. The government frequently pressured Renault into buying ailing machine-tool or tractor makers to protect jobs. Wages were 15% higher than at France's private auto maker, Peugeot S.A.    As long as the French car market kept growing, Renault could afford such largess. But in 1984, the bottom fell out of the market. In one year, Renault, long Europe's biggest auto maker, plunged to sixth place, and its 1984 loss widened sharply to 12.5 billion francs on sales of 117.6 billion francs. Acknowledging that Renault had driven off a cliff, France's then-Socialist government abruptly fired the chairman, Bernard Hanon, in January 1985. It replaced him with Georges Besse. His mission: make money.    Mr. Besse broke with tradition. He slashed Renault's work force by 25%, to 79,000. He all but froze wages and cut many bonuses. He sharply reduced output. He dropped such marginal activities as making Formula One racing cars and bicycles and pulled back from troubled markets such as Mexico.    But just as a turnaround was becoming apparent -- Renault's losses were halved in two years -- tragedy struck: Mr. Besse was murdered by terrorists last November.    However, his successor, Raymond Levy, is pursuing the cost-cutting strategy. Earlier this year, Mr. Levy ended Renault's costly involvement with American Motors Corp., and by year end Renault's work force is expected to be down to 75,000. With sales likely to reach about 140 billion francs this year, Mr. Levy is talking of making the company the most profitable auto maker in Europe.    &quot;To repay our debts, we have to earn money,&quot; he says. &quot;To earn money, we have to sell cars. To sell cars, we have to have good products that sell at a good price.&quot;    Under the new strategy, Renault, which once simply relied on expanding sales to cover its high costs, now is adapting its costs to a stagnant market. It sells fewer cars -- 1.4 million last year, down from 1.8 million in 1980 -- but it should earn more money because its productivity gains have cut its costs.    So swift has been its return to profitability that France's conservative-led government will soon submit to parliament a proposal that Renault switch from being a state agency to a limited-liability, state-owned company. Though remaining state-owned, it would no longer have a blank check from the government. Ultimately, it may be sold to private investors.    That idea would have been unthinkable here a few years ago. When Charles de Gaulle nationalized the company in 1945 to punish its owner, Louis Renault, for collaborating with the Nazi occupation, he called Renault &quot;my daughter.&quot; Over the years, the Communist Party found a home in Renault. When the Socialists nationalized many French companies in 1982, they held up Renault as a model.    But today Renault has become a model for all that is wrong with state intervention in business. The Socialist government's economic failures rehabilitated the ideas of free enterprise and profit in France. And now the conservative government, breaking with a long French tradition of state involvement in the economy, is returning to private ownership most of the nationalized companies and banks and is deregulating business. Renault has turned into a conservative showpiece.    &quot;The most spectacular symbol of the profound change in France is to take the most spectacular symbol of the state-owned company, make it profitable and then put it on the market,&quot; says Marc de Scitivaux, a top adviser to French Industry Minister Alain Madelin.    The changes in Renault are important not only for France. Even though the company had to withdraw from the U.S. market, it still could reconquer Europe. With the European Community scheduled to tear down its internal trade barriers in 1992, a revitalized Renault might be able to forge a strategic alliance with another European car maker, perhaps Peugeot.    &quot;At the moment, no Western European auto manufacturer can look General Motors, Ford or Toyota squarely in the eye,&quot; says Arthur Way of the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London market-research concern. &quot;But if the two French makers could somehow get their act together, that would be a formidable European car maker with a big, loyal home base.&quot;    However, Renault still has a long drive ahead to catch up with German quality or Japanese efficiency.    Though acknowledging that Renault has improved its cars, Mr. Kress of Booz Allen contends that &quot;they haven't kept up with the world standard of quality. That's what killed them.&quot;    Manufacturing efficiency presents a similarly mixed picture, even though the layoffs have raised Renault's productivity 10% annually in each of the past two years. At 13.5 cars per employee per year, it is comparable to some U.S. producers but only one-third as good as the Japanese. At Billancourt, robots now do 60% of the chassis welds, a big change; but in some Japanese plants, robots do them all.    &quot;The guy who gets his lifeboat bailed out has accomplished something,&quot; Mr. Kress says. &quot;But he's not saved if he's 1,000 miles from land and he's not sure where the land is and he hasn't found the paddle yet.&quot;    Moreover, the years of losses have left Renault awash in 54 billion francs of debt, and its liabilities exceed its assets by 16.4 billion francs. To help Renault out, the government will probably inject 10 billion to 12 billion francs into Renault as part of its plan to change its legal status, despite howls of unfair competition from Peugeot. But the government argues that it is simply doing its job as a shareholder and that, without these funds, Renault would be bankrupt.    Though viewing the government's plan to change Renault's status as a sign that now the company can stand on its own, Mr. Levy himself comments, &quot;We're like a kid whose training wheels are being taken off his bike.&quot;    Preparing his managers for the tough ride ahead, Mr. Levy held two weekend seminars for them last summer at a chateau near Paris. &quot;They shouted at each other but emerged with an idea of what they wanted to do,&quot; says a source close to Renault. Such results-oriented management, executives say, contrasts sharply with the previous civil-servant mentality. Even Renault's advertisements have become more aggressive; the current campaign, called &quot;The Challenge,&quot; shows Renaults soaring down a German autobahn.    Mr. Levy moved boldly in March to end Renault's long-held &quot;American dream&quot; and sell its 46% stake in American Motors to Chrysler. Since 1979, Renault had pumped $645 million into AMC, and during that period AMC lost about $750 million. Some analysts think Renault bailed out just as its investment was starting to pay off. But Renault officials say they had to choose between continuing to pour money into the U.S. and focusing on Europe. &quot;It was a necessary amputation for Renault's good,&quot; says Jose Dedeurwaerder, Renault's sales director and formerly AMC's chairman. &quot;We have no regrets.&quot;    But Renault's recovery is fragile. It was helped by two record years for European car sales and by the French government's recent decision to cut the sales tax on cars. &quot;About 40% of their recovery is due to their own efforts, about 60% due to the market,&quot; says John Lawson, a Nomura Securities analyst in London. Others wonder how Renault will fare in a general auto-sales slump.    Although Mr. Levy says Renault's cost cutting precludes future losses of the 1984 magnitude, Booz Allen's Mr. Kress complains that its moves so far &quot;haven't been done with a vision. Levy has a tactic for the next two years but no strategy.&quot; Mr. Kress discerns few plans for reducing design or parts costs and little vision of what Renault's products will be a few years down the road.    Still, the government wants to push ahead with the change in Renault's status, a move that one government official describes as &quot;the antechamber of privatization.&quot; Turning Renault into a private company would be the ultimate symbol of the change in industrial France.    Long gone are the days when Renault's flagship Billancourt plant was regarded as a workers' fortress employing 30,000 and essentially co-managed by the Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once summed up French social policy by saying, &quot;One mustn't dishearten Billancourt.&quot; Today, only 5,000 people work here.    The five-story plant, marooned on an island in the Seine on the western edge of Paris, looks like a giant cruise ship badly needing a paint job. Inside, the remaining assembly line turns out a respectable 450 minivans a day, but nobody feels secure. &quot;I'm scared of losing my job,&quot; says an assembly-line worker as he solders a rear chassis.    He has reason to be scared. On a similar assembly line nearby, a yellow and black robot is performing the same soldering job, a lot faster. This section of the Billancourt line lost 50 men last year and will shed another 50 of its current 420-man work force next year. Managers say they hope to squeeze more productivity out of custom-designed robot welders and through Japanese-style &quot;quality circles&quot; and work teams.    Although CGT bulletin boards carry yellow posters emblazoned &quot;That's Enough&quot; and decrying the coming change in Renault's legal status, most of the fearful workers ignore them. They know Billancourt's days are numbered: Management has said Renault's next car, a replacement for the mid-sized Renault 9, won't be built here. When the minivan line closes, so probably will Billancourt.    The plant is hopelessly outdated, Renault managers say, despite the productivity gains. Started in 1929, it was built upward because land was scarce. Now, the cost of moving parts and finished assemblies from floor to floor is prohibitive.    Billancourt does retain some value, though. Stopping alongside the fifth-floor spray-painting line, Michel Gornet, the deputy plant manager, throws open a door to reveal what he calls &quot;the best view of the Eiffel Tower from anywhere.&quot; And Edouard Cointreau, a consultant, says that if Renault did close the factory and sell the island, it would benefit mightily. &quot;It's the last real-estate gold mine in Paris,&quot; he says.    Wouldn't selling Billancourt be a powerful symbol of the new Renault? Mr. Gornet is asked. &quot;We don't want to be a symbol of anything,&quot; he retorts. &quot;We want to be a company like all the others.&quot;    ---                  Renault Aims for a Comeback                       Europe's Leaders        Car makers ranked by market share in June 1987    Fiat                                            15.0%    Volkswagen                                      14.8%    Ford                                            11.8%    Peugeot                                         11.6%    General Motors                                  10.9%    Renault                                         10.4%    Mercedes-Benz                                    3.5%    Rover Group                                      3.3%    Nissan                                           2.8%    Toyota                                           2.7%    BMW                                              2.4%                            Renault                 (Dollar amounts in millions)    12/86       12/85       12/84       12/83       12/82    Sales   $21,714     $20,207     $19,478     $18,253     $17,242    Net Income (Loss)    $(918)     $(1,810)    $(2,080)     $(261)      $(212)    Long-Term Debt    $8,947     $10,090      $7,622      $5,339      $4,032    Car Production (in millions)      1.5         1.4         1.5         1.8         1.7    Share of European New-Car Market     10.7%       10.7%       10.9%       12.6%       14.6%   NOTE: Dollar amounts translated from French francs attherate of 6.0375 francs per dollar   Sources: Economist Intelligence Unit; Fitch InvestorsService</TEXT></DOC>
