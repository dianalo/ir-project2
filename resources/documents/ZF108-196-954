(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE TECHNICAL documentation market has been swept by dramatic changes in thetwo years since the U.S.andP;  Department of Defense launched the Computer-aidedAcquisition and Logistics Support (CALS) initiative.andP;  Two years ago, the newmandate was viewed as a potential milestone that contractors would have towear, and few were warm to the idea.andP;  The DoD did its best to pitch the greatbenefits of its program, but to industry, it looked like a burden they wouldbear in the long-term interest of American taxpayers, who presumably wouldsee the military get more or at least better weapons for its dollars in thefuture.andP;  (In the interim, the costs of CALs compliance will certainly bebuilt into the price of new weapons; contractors aren't going to undertakecompliance for free.)andM;By last year, when demos of new products began to appear, the tone hadshifted from putting off the pain as long as possible to one of turning toface the bear (or gorilla, as we called it) that loomed ahead.andP;  But in thepast year, as large contractors began to tackle in earnest the problem ofmeeting the CALS requirements, a strange thing happened: industry met thebear and discovered that the two had something in common.andP;  In the process offacing CALS, industry is becoming a supporter of CALS, not only because itmust, but because it is discovering that it makes sense.andM;In the beginning, CALS was viewed as a set of data formats that industry andgovernment would use to transfer information by computer instead of by paper.andO;That view still holds, and to many it is all CALs will ever be used for.andP;  Butwe also see a new, broader view of CALS.andM;The new view is a more holistic one premised on the assumption that documentswill not only be transferred electronically, they will be created, revised,updated, published and delivered electronically.andP;  With this premise in mind,contractors are starting to view CALS as the catalyst for overhauling theirentire information infrastructure.andP;  The mood has changed from viewing CALS asa burden for production departments of publishing operations to seeing CALsas a component of an overall model for database building and documentinterchange in industry at large, not just within defense contracts.andM;The shifting mindset was evident at the second CALS Expo, held in December inOrlando, Florida.andP;  Critics who once contended that CALS is too limited to beof much use outside the defense world were admitting that some of the samepaper-intensive problems exist in other industries, and that the approachembodied by CALS makes sense for many other applications.andP;  And within thedefense sector, the tone of the speeches changed from persuading the audiencethat CALS is good to discussions about how to make it work and explorationsof where it will lead in the future.andM;The most encouraging aspect of the Expo, though, was the exhibition, whichhad upwards of 3,000 attenders (including the first wave of nonaerospaceparticipants), more than 100 exhibitors (including full-sized booths by halfa dozen computer companies) and-most importantly-new products that serve abroader market than CALS.andP;  Although the vast majority of attenders at CALSExpo will be directly affected by the DoD mandate, some of the products theysaw may soon appear at other trade shows aimed at other markets.andM;At the first CALS Expo in October 1988, most products shown were prototypesaimed at providing base-level compliance with the interchange standards.andP;  Inplain terms, this meant being able to write a document to a magnetic tape inSGML, IGES and CCITT group 4 formats.andP;  In many cases, it meant interim,inelegant solutions designed to convert formatted data and documents into aneutral interchange format.andP;  Reality check.andP;  This year's demonstrations werequite different in two respects.andP;  First, reality is taking hold, among bothvendors and users.andP;  It is now becoming apparent that making CALS work will bemore difficult than the DoD believed.andP;  But offsetting current problems is thebelief that in the long run the CALS approach is viable-and potentiallyrewarding.andM;The downside this year was discovering how much work has yet to be done.andP;  Thesheer difficulty of making the interchange standards work in actualapplications is hampering product development at the same time that vendorsare desperately trying to position themselves as CALS compliant.andP;  The newlyissued output specification is a case in point.andP;  We had hoped to see itimplemented by several vendors.andP;  Instead, we saw only one vendor (Datalogics)demonstrating a small portion of the output spec.andP;  As vendors try to finishtheir products, they are quickly discovering that there are more wrinkles toiron out in the nitty-gritty details of CALS than customers are willing tobelieve.andM;We hope that the DoD seriously considers the complaints of the vendors,because CALS win only work if there are widely available products thatsupport it.andP;  Right now, the industry faces a Catch-22: vendors are uncoveringbugs, and customers are holding out for shrink-wrapped CALS products thathide most of the gory details from the user.andP;  Serious prospective customersare currently faced with the sobering prospect of becoming experts themselvesin order to understand why products do not conform or why the standards donot meet their requirements.andP;  That prospect leads to further reluctance tobuy systems, which constricts product development:andM;The inexperience with SGML that characterizes most users has also driven upthe costs of CALS systems, as vendors find that training is the mostexpensive component of supplying a CALS system.andP;  This trend was driven homethis year, as vendors began pricing CALS packages.andP;  Implementing CALS in thenear term is going to be far messier than the simplistic flow charts the DoDuses to convey the concepts of its initiative, and it will be far moreexpensive in terms of human resources than many users had hoped.andM;But some we looking ahead.andP;  There was an upside to this year's CALSexhibition, though, and it may be more far-reaching than the downside.andP;  Thisyear's show marked the emergence of a new wave of CALS products.andP;  These newtools are not limited to publishing production; they encompass the entirepublishing cycle, from creation to maintenance.andP;  Tech-doc has just become thevanguard of database management and retrieval for the entire publishingmarket.andM;IBM is a good example.andP;  Although IBM's development efforts are being drivenby its need to fulfill CALS requirements, it is looking ahead to the adoptionof standards such as SGML in other industries.andP;  Accordingly, its products,although packaged for CALS, are sufficiently general in design and purposethat they could be adapted to other industries.andP;  Although the complexity ofimplementing SGML is still a barrier to its use, a few of IBM's customers inpharmaceutical, automotive and other industries, as well as aerospace, arebeginning to explore the use of SGML for more than just interchange.andP;  IBM'sdatabase approach to CALS is shadowed by Digital and HewlettPackard, both ofwhich showed database products in their exhibits.andM;joining the computer suppliers in the insurgence into the CALS arena areapplication vendors such as Oracle and Sherpa.andP;  The new buzzword is&quot;configuration management.&quot; Configuration management tools address theproblem of managing information, not just formatting it.andP;  Again, althoughCALS is driving much of the development, these tools are likely to be adoptedby a wide range of engineering users in many areas outside of CALS in the1990s, and, before long, they win be tailored to publishing applicationsoutside of engineering.andP;  Hypertext meets SGML.andP;  As contractors begin toexplore the world of digital documents, they are looking for computer toolsto navigate by.andP;  The hierarchical approach to structuring informationcontinues, and object-based programming is starting to make object-baseddatabases a viable alternative to relational ones.andP;  But hypertext-ornonsequential writing-is emerging as an additional tool for viewing documentdata-bases.andP;  Several people have already discovered that hypertext links maybe intertwined with SGML markup.andP;  The result is that as industry begins tomove from formatted documents to generically identified databases ofinformation, it will also move toward new forms of communication andpresentation of that information to the person sitting in front of a computerscreen.andP;  Those new forms of communication will not be limited to CALS; CALSwill only be one application of technologies developed as a result of theDoD's initiative.andM;As is our custom, our review is focused on the new products we found on theshow floor.andP;  As companies implement the products, we hope to bring you casestudies as well, and already we are planning to have several case studiespresented at this year's Seybold Seminars.andP;  For now, we'd like to note thatthis is the first time that we've covered database applications as a separatetopic at a trade show.andP;  We doubt it will be the last.andM;Database ProductsandM;DEC: Engineering flavor to management Digital's current management tool isits Engineering Document Control System (EDCS), a program designed for basicfile management of large databases residing on distributed Vax systems.andP;  EDCSnow runs on DECwindows, which gives it a nice, menu-driven interface.andP;  Thequerying, searching and viewing tools are fairly intuitive, for example.andM;The drawback to EDCS is that because it is a finished application, the userinterface (what attributes may be applied and tracked) is not customizable.andO;Thus, although Digital offers EDCS as a management tool for publishing, theprogram carries a strong engineering flavor that publishing managers may findtoo restrictive.andP;  As Digital considers its role as a system supplier inenvironments that run many applications, we would expect it to extend EDCS toallow more customization, but it has made no commitments to doing so.andM;Currently, EDCS supports one process-electronic mail- that may beautomatically invoked at the completion of certain tasks.andP;  This is animportant first step.andP;  We hope Digital will enhance this capability tosupport other processes as well.andM;HP: Apollo spotlights SherpaandM;In the CALS market, Hewlett-Packard is letting its Apollo Division take thelead in exploring solutions for customers.andP;  For over a year, Apollo hasencouraged its third-party developers to join its CALS solution group.andO;Interleaf and Context were the first publishing vendors to join the group.andO;The newest members, announced at CALS Expo, are Arbortext, developer of ThePublisher; GTX, a supplier of scanning and graphics products; MentorGraphics, the leading supplier of integrated electronic design systems andthe parent of Context; and Sherpa, which supplies document managementsoftware and services.andM;A guide to the publishing trail.andP;  Sherpa, named for the guides who accompanyclimbers in the Himalayan mountains, demonstrated its Design ManagementSystem, which is software for data and configuration management.andP;  Thesoftware helps manage and track the flow of engineering data, from designinception through manufacturing, in a way that is independent of file W.andO;Sherpa's software runs on any TCP/IP or DECnet network, on HP minicomputers,Digital Vaxes, and HP, Apollo and Sun Unix workstations.andP;  It supports the useof PCs on the net.andM;in broad terms, Sherpa puts a wrapper around every file associated with aproject, regardless of the applications (database, CALS, c&quot;, CALS,publishing, etc.) used to create and manipulate the data of die projectitself.andP;  Each wrapper is a series of attributes associated with the file.andO;Sherpa tracks the logging in and out of files and their movement through thedatabase and engineering or publishing process and enables the manager tochange the configuration of the project by changing the attributes.andM;Sherpa's system operates as a layer above the operating system thatinterfaces to applications.andP;  A full programming language interface supportingC and Fortran allows Sherpa or its customers to write their own applications.andO;An example might be programs to generate and view customer-specific formsbased on frequently used query sets.andM;One of the interesting aspects of Sherpa's system is the notion of triggers.andO;Triggers are events that automatically invoke other actions.andP;  For example, anadministrator might want to change access privileges to a project once itreaches a certain stage.andP;  The changes could be set up ahead of time, and whenthe trigger event happens (such as when the file is reviewed by a designatedmanager), the changes to privileges are automatically invoked.andP;  Although itis possible in most systems to set up batch files that do automaticprocessing, even to the point of running batch routines when a file enters acertain queue, few systems support the invocation of processes based onchanging attributes of a file.andM;In managing the configuration of a project, Sherpa's system welds databasemanagement with the process of managing and tracking the flow of a particularproject in a way that does not alter the existing database.andP;  It is a databasemanagement shell that the user wraps around a project to control it at amanagement level, without touching the content of the data.andP;  As such, itholds promise as a forerunner of future application oriented managementtools.andM;Sherpa now has dozens of customer sites at Fortune 500 companies in the U.S.andO;and Europe, including Hughes Radar, Rockwell, Ford Aerospace and N.V.andO;Phillips.andP;  Although the initial release of its product was targeted atstraight engineering applications, Sherpa already has several customers whoare using it to manage the publishing process.andP;  For example, Ford Aerospaceand Boeing Electronics are using Sherpa to track work instruction packagesthat are produced in Interleaf TPS.andP;  Work instruction packages are documentsthat tell assemblers how to build highly complex electronic devices.andP;  Theyare technically complex but are produced m very low volume.andP;  In October,Sherpa entered into a cooperative marketing agreement with Interleaf.andM;The pricing of Sherpa's software varies according to volume.andP;  In volumes ofmore than 100 users, the price is between $1,000 and $2,000 per user.andM;Sherpa Corp., 611 River Oaks Pkwy., San Jose, CA 95134; phone (408) 433-0455.andM;IBM shows a prototypeandM;IBM showed a prototype tool for managing a document database.andP;  Essentially,the product is a relational database manager that puts a wrapper on everytext file.andP;  The wrapper consists of database field records that containattributes about the file.andP;  By using a full-fledged database manager, IBMmakes the number and types of fields open-ended, which allows the system tobe tailored to specific applications and user requirements.andM;The use of a full-fledged database manager also opens up the possibility forsophisticated query and report facilities at the document management level.andO;Strategically, IBM's product looks to be the sort of powerful management toolthat will be needed as documentation is generated on demand from distributeddatabases, rather than from localized document repositories.andM;Unlike Sherpa's program, though, IBM's is based on a relational databaseprogram that does not support processes-at least at this time.andP;  The detailsof what IBM's product might look like in the first release are still sketchy,but the underpinnings look promising.andM;IBM demos its CALS suiteandM;CALS Expo marked the formal launch of IBM's suite of CALS products, which wereported on in our November 27 issue (Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  6).andP;  This was our firstchance to see the products, and we were favorably impressed.andP;  IBM is notknown for its application software.andP;  Yet in its CALS suite, it has not onlypieced together several products to create an end-to-end solution but alsoestablished the framework for integrating those products under a single userinterface.andP;  Just as important, IBM has developed general-purpose productsthat may be tailored to other applications that do not fall directly underthe CALS directive.andM;As we mentioned in the introduction, most of the computer suppliers aretrying to position their platforms as foundations for CALS systems.andP;  But sofar IBM is the only one to also follow through with a full suite of its ownCALS products.andP;  IBM TextWrite.andP;  Those people who are familiar with thetechnical documentation market will recognize TextWrite's origins fromDatalogics, which supplied its Writerstation editor to IBM to form the coreof the product.andP;  IBM incorporated its own parser and spelling checker andthen added an OS/2 interface to the product, giving it a more appealing userinterface than the command-driven Writerstation, which is targeted attechnical writers in a Datalogics publishing environment.andM;It won't be ready to ship until this spring, but IBM TextWrite has in one fenswoop legitimized the SGML editor marketplace.andP;  Other SGML editors were outfirst, but TextWrite brings SGML editors into the realm of the commercialworld.andP;  We have always felt that SGML need not be as cumbersome for writersto deal with as it is proclaimed to be; SoftQuad has shown that for sometime.andP;  IBM's product shows it can be done on a PC-and brings the weight ofIBM behind the concept of structured editors.andP;  In our eyes, the question isnot how many other vendors will respond, but how quickly they will do so.andM;In general, TextWrite has most of the features we would expect of astructured editor.andP;  The program uses a context-sensitive cursor to inform theuser where in the hierarchy the cursor is at any given location and promptthe user with a list of valid tags, depending on context.andM;TextWrite will validate entire documents or document sections.andP;  Validating anentire document creates an error log, which may be opened at the same time asthe document in another window.andP;  The user can then search on the errors tocorrect invalid markup.andM;When inserting a tag, the system automatically invokes a dialog box askingthe user to fill in the attributes associated with that clement.andP;  Ellipsesindicate required attributes; asterisks indicate optional ones.andP;  This is justthe sort of help software developers can offer end users in demystifyingSGML.andM;Any element in the document may be styled by the user (or systemadministrator m a controlled environment).andP;  The style palette supports up to128 different styles on the screen, through the use of colors and othercharacter attributes (bold, italic, etc.).andP;  The styles are automaticallyapplied as elements are inserted by picking their tags (either from die menuor by a function key).andM;One of the powerful aspects of SGML is its support for externalentities-elements of a document may reside outside of the document itself.andO;In TextWrite, such entities may be searched separately from other textstrings.andP;  Furthermore, using the multitasking capability in OS/2, IBM enablesthe user to launch external applications (such as a graphic editor) fromwithin the entity reference of the document.andP;  Someone with access to graphicscould use this feature to edit both graphics and text in a document withoutviolating the document's SGML structure or syntax.andM;TextWrite is intended to be a multiuser application, with PC networkingsupport provided automatically by OS/2 Lan Manager.andP;  Currently, the productwill also interface to an MVS or VM host.andM;Although they were few, there were some disappointments.andP;  The spellingchecker, thankfully, works both as a batch process and interactively.andP;  But itlacks support for user dictionaries.andP;  We have yet to encounter a commercialdictionary that is so complete as to include proper nouns such as companynames.andP;  A user dictionary is essential if the operator is to employ aspelling checker effectively for regular word processing.andM;Another disappointment was that some of the keyboard shortcuts that makeWriterstation so fast have been omitted because OS/2 reserves certainkeystroke combinations.andP;  A basic example was the lack of a single keystrokefor defining a sentence.andP;  Using the application builder (TextWrite Tools,available in May), it may be possible to create alternative shortcuts.andP;  Wehope IBM will offer users help in this area: not every writer is enamored ofthe mouse.andM;TextWrite: Bringing SGML for the masses.andP;  Two years ago, Jeff Mason, thenhead of IBM's Publishing Business Unit, said that SGML was a strategicdirection for IBM.andP;  His statement was not accompanied by product details, soit was difficult to assess just what that meant.andP;  The real implications ofthe strategy will be felt later in the 1990s, but IBM has already made onedramatic move: it has introduced a commercial SGML editor, IBM TextWrite.andM;It is no surprise that TextWrite will find its first use in the CALSenvironment, where SGML is a prerequisite.andP;  But the significance of TextWriteis that it is a true SGML editor that may be used with any SGML application.andO;IBM strategically did not develop a CALS-only product.andP;  In taking a strategicapproach to the use of SGML, IBM is preparing for a future in whichpublishing is as closely linked with databases as it is with formatteddocuments.andM;IBM's vision for the use of SGML is one that we believe is not yet trulyappreciated.andP;  Many users still view SGML as a tagging scheme that facilitatesdocument interchange.andP;  It certainly serves that purpose.andP;  But SGML is ameta-language that may be used for databases as well as composed documents.andO;As that realization begins to take hold among users, SGML editors likeTextWrite will become much more widespread, as users search for newdatabase-entry tools.andP;  Os/2 CALS Driver.andP;  We mentioned in our initialcoverage of IBM's CALS products that the utilities for building CALS tapesreside on the mainframe.andP;  What we didn't know was that IBM has developed aPC-based tool for controlling what happens on the mainframe.andP;  At CALS Expo wesaw the OS/2 CALs Driver, an interface between mainframe and PC that enablesthe CALS production manager to control virtually all operations at the PC.andM;The &quot;driver&quot; is in one sense the program for creating CALS tapes: the outputdriver in this case is a magnetic tape format rather than a page descriptionlanguage.andP;  But the program is really an application for managing documents,with tools for filing, filtering, organizing and assembling documentcomponents--text, graphics and images-into whole documents.andM;In its initial implementation, document formatting and most of thetransforms, or filters, take place using the mainframe publishing system.andO;But the driver itself is detached from the formatting and tape-buildingprocesses, so that it could be configured with other applications-such asInterleaf-that perform the same role.andP;  IBM is the first vendor to demonstratethis sort of configurable-system approach, and it is one we find appealing.andM;One reason for its appeal is that the OS/2 CALS Driver underscores IBM'semphasis on workstation functionality in its CALS suite.andP;  In a radicaldeparture from IBM's traditional approach to large-scale publishing, the CALSgroup is making use of as many workstation applications as possible, usingthe host as more of a database server than the engine for core applications.andO;Mainframe customers will continue to make use of main-frame-based graphics,word processing and publishing tools.andP;  And, with the new software, they canuse mainframes to produce CALS-compliant documents.andP;  But IBM's publishingunit sees the role of the mainframe changing as more and more users havetheir own microcomputers.andP;  IBM also recognizes that many customers don't havemainframes, and those that do may not have large-scale CALS publishingrequirements.andP;  Accordingly, its strategy for CALS is not premised on theassumption that users will have mainframes.andM;IBM's demo highlighted text processing, autotagging and graphics editingtaking place on PS/2s.andP;  In the graphics area, IBM is working with thirdparties such as Micrografx and Corel to ensure that graphics editors willcontain the filters necessary for CALS.andP;  And although its firstimplementation of CALS compliance, which was shown at CALS Expo, uses amainframe for building the tapes, IBM emphasized that what was shown was onlya first product.andP;  Future products will advance the role of workstationproducts.andM;IBM did not comment on how soon it might offer an entire solution based onworkstations, but elsewhere on the floor US Lynx introduced several PC-basedproducts that make such a scenario possible today (see US Lynx, below).andM;Interleaf teams with AvalancheandM;Most users do not currently have their documents in SGML form.andP;  But the SGMLconversion of most publishing products (Interleaf included) assumes anincoming SGML file.andP;  How then, do you get your existing document databaseinto SGML coding?andM;Avalanche is by far the most popular supplier of software for convertingformatted files into generic ASCII files with SGML markup.andP;  It has become anOEM to the majority of tech-doc publishing suppliers.andP;  The latest reseller isinterleaf, which introduced LeafTag, a version of Avalanche's software forInterleaf users.andM;LeafTag  will convert Interleaf documents that were created in TPS on Unixworkstations or with IBM Interleaf Publisher on PCs.andP;  It also supportsconversion of hard-copy files scanned via an optical character reader,several word processing formats and straight ASCII files.andM;Interleaf expects to have LeafTag available on Sun workstations in March.andO;Pricing was not available at press time.andP;  Taunton: SGML, retrieval andhypertext How do you put CALS documents on a CD-ROM? Taunton Engineering'sanswer is to use its PC-based indexing and retrieval engine.andP;  Taunton is anOEM for the federal government and government contractors.andP;  Its engine, onwhich we briefly reported in April 1988 (Vol.andP;  17, No.andP;  14), has beenavailable for several years as an OEM product.andP;  The latest version of theretrieval engine incorporates hypertext links and foreign character sets intothe basic engine, which is designed to work with SGML constructs.andM;The system works with SGML in several ways.andP;  It will expand entityreferences-abbreviations in SGML parlance.andP;  It can restrict searches andviewing to document elements, such as searching and displaying just footnotesif you remember that you saw something in a footnote but couldn't rememberwhere.andP;  Its proximity parameter works with document elements, so that thenearby text strings must be found within specified document elements (toavoid matches that span different chapters, for example).andP;  Finally, Tauntonis able to search on tag attributes, as well as the tags themselves.andP;  Thisfeature might be used to locate information that had been marked as topsecret, to use a current CALS example.andM;Another use of the SCML coding is formatting.andP;  Taunton interprets the tags inits formatted, which generates PostScript output.andP;  This enables the user togenerate formatted hard copy of documents found during the search.andM;Adding hypertext.andP;  Taunton has devised a scheme by which publishers can addhypertext link to their electronically published information.andP;  The Wandamp; areinserted manually into a document by the publisher before it is indexed andput on CD-Rom.andP;  The links are then activated by an end user within thecontext of the retrieval engine.andM;Links are embedded using SGML syntax but are displayed on screen ashighlighted comments.andP;  Links may be to text or images.andP;  In each case,following the link stores the file on the screen and calls the associatedtext file or image to the screen for viewing or printing.andP;  The process offollowing links among documents is quite fast because of the quickness ofTaunton's retrieval engine.andM;The system maintains an audit trail of your path as you traverse severaldocuments, so you can return to your starting point no matter how far awayyou wander.andP;  Aside from being able to retrace your steps, there aren't anynavigational aids for viewing the links the publisher created.andM;Foreign character sets are sometimes problematic for retrieval engines.andO;Taunton supports all of the ISO character sets as well as Norse runes, Hebrewand Hiragana.andP;  The system will automatically switch character sets ifnecessary when following hypertext links.andM;Taunton Engineering, 505 Middlesex Turnpike, Suite 11, Billerica, MA 01821;phone (508) 663-3667.andM;US Lynx: CALS to VenturaandM;US Lynx is applying its expertise in data and media conversion to the CALSmarket.andP;  Its first CALS product was its CALS-to-XICS converter, which Xeroxis using in its system.andP;  Having done the hard part of figuring out how tointerpret an SGML file for one formatter, US Lynx announced the CALS InstanceImager, a generalized product that will read 1840A tapes and convert them foruse with any of several formatters.andP;  At CALS Expo, US Lynx introduced supportfor one of the most popular formatters on the market: Ventura Publisher.andM;Ventura  CALS Instance Imager.andP;  The CALS-to-Ventura software reads an1840A-compliant tape and reshapes the SGML text files into tagged, formattedVentura multichapter documents, complete with graphics and tables and readyfor output.andP;  The US Lynx converter includes the page styles for formatting38784-B pages and the graphics filters for converting IGES, CGM and CCITTGroup 4 fax files into Gem formats.andP;  Although we didn't see it running, USLynx says its converter handles tables, automatic counters andcross-references, index extraction, generated lists, footnotes, entityreferences, nested elements, security levels, ISO character sets and allforms of character emphasis.andM;When we saw the initial unveiling of the CALS Instance Imager, we wereimpressed with the level of understanding US Lynx has incorporated into itsproduct (Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  2).andP;  Applying the product to Ventura has beendifficult, because US Lynx does not have access to the Ventura code, andVentura Publisher doesn't handle all of the conditions required by the 1840Aspecification.andP;  To automate the conversion process, US Lynx has had to writesome of its own routines-for indexing to four levels (Ventura only supportstwo levels) and maintaining revision levels and security attributes, forexample-to accomplish tasks that Ventura does not currently support.andM;The product's functionality is impressive, but so is the price: $14,950.andO;This includes three days of training; the Datalogics parser and Writerstationeditor; US Lynx Instance Imager; and PC Tape Handler (see below).andP;  Althoughit sounds exorbitant by mass market standards, $15,000 is one-third the priceof a CALS package from any other vendor.andP;  The only drawback is that someVentura users may find three days of training  insufficient.andP;  Additionaltraining would naturally raise the price, and, in fact, the high price ofmost CALS packages is directly attributable to the amount and quality ofsupport provided.andM;PC tape handler.andP;  The product that dovetails with the Ventura converter is USLynx's new PC Tape Handler.andP;  It is the first product on the market forreading and writing 1840A files on a magnetic tape drive attached to a PC.andO;Currently, all other products on the market are connected to Unixworkstations, minicomputers or mainframes.andM;The US Lynx tape handier is software for reading and writing to the tapedrive, including a menu-based interface for adding the necessary CALS headerinformation when writing files.andP;  It will automatically validate that therequired information is in the Document Declaration; append CALS headers asit writes the files; and create a transaction log as it reads incoming files.andM;The software, which is available now, costs $4,000 and works with mostPertec-compatible drives.andM;Xerox: Hypertext in ViewCardsandM;The ViewPoint environment is currently being ported over to Sun hardware, butin the meantime, Xerox continues to offer new products on the 6085 platform.andO;The latest product is a hypertext application called ViewCards.andM;Viewcards is a single-user application for creating a series of cards (framesas large as a full screen) that may be linked bidirectionally with othercards.andP;  It is an object-based system in which the root box is a compositeobject that contains one or more cards.andP;  Each successive card is an objectthat may terminate the node or itself be a composite object, containing othercards.andP;  Links need not follow the hierarchy of the objects.andM;Two views.andP;  There are two views of the card set.andP;  One is the browser, whichshows the hierarchy of the cards along with the links.andP;  The other view isgraphical-the links associated with a card are shown as symbols within thecard itself.andM;Both views may be used to navigate by opening a link to follow it to itsdestination, which opens the frame at the other end.andP;  Because ViewPointsupports multiple windows, the user may have any number of frames open atonce.andM;Different link type.andP;  The user may differentiate types of links.andP;  Each linktype has its own property sheet in which the user can name and associatespecific attributes with different types of links.andP;  For example, in weaponsdocumentation, links to supporting illustrations or lists might bedifferentiated from links to frames that are snapshots of book pages.andP;  (Youcan't actually link to a document that is more than one frame, but you canpaste screen images of pages onto frames.) The fact that links may be ofdifferent types is indicated by link icons, which may be unique for each linktype.andM;The symbols, or icons, that represent links are created and modified in asymbol editor that works just like a bitmap paint program.andP;  The editor showsa matrix of pixels that may be turned on or off to create a shape within thebounding limits of the symbol area.andM;The price of ViewCards is $595 for single licenses.andP;  The initial applicationof ViewCards is by Westinghouse, which is applying it to documentation of theF-16 fighter plane.andM;Packaging of CALS product.andP;  At CALS Expo, Xerox formally announced its CCALSCompliance Service as a commercially available product.andP;  The Service is a12-month contract  that provides software licensing, site planning, trainingand on-site applications consultation.andP;  Contracts, customized to eachsituation, are priced from $54,000-a bargain considering that the trainingincludes 3 days at a Xerox site and 20 days of consulting at your site.andM;In addition to training and consulting, the basic configuration includesthree licenses for SGML authoring in VewPoint; one license each for SGMLvalidation and editing, SGML-to-XICS conversion, IGES to/from Xerox Expertconversion, CCITT Group 4 to/from Xerox Pro Illustrator conversion, the 1840Atape software for a Vax and the CALS style information for the XPS publishingsystem.andP;  The base price assumes you already have an XPS system and three6085s (one with Companion 386).andM;The fuctionality of the system's components was described in our articleabout Tech-Doc.andP;  In general, we found Xerox's end-to-end approach quitethorough, although it does not address any documentation management issues.andO;The pricing, as we mentioned, is aggressive.andP;  Our one objection is that 6085users have to buy an XPS to output pages.andP;  US Lynx has already demonstratedone alternative that the 6085 user base may find more appealing than learningan XPSandM;Yard unveils Write-itandM;The formal debut of the Write-It SGML editor was as disappointing as it wasgratifying.andP;  Among those at the show with whom we discussed the product, manybelieved it to be the most thorough SGML editor to date.andP;  Write-It makes useof the Mark-It parser (developed by Yard's sister company Sobemap), which isused by many publishing vendors in their SGML packages.andM;Two important aspects of the program arc its price ($475) and its ability torun within 640K on an AT-class PC.andP;  Although Yard does not yet have itsdistribution channels in place, Write-It is being offered at an affordableprice to the large installed base of PCs.andM;As you would expect, the program prompts you as to what tags are valid at anygiven cursor location, and it warns you when you are about to insert aninvalid tag.andM;The display of characters may be altered to show formatting through the useof control characters.andP;  The user may apply various stylistic changes anywherein the document, the same as in a conventional word processor.andP;  When it isexported, all control characters are stripped from the file.andM;Although formatting may be simplified through the use of macros, there is nostyle palette as in IBM's TextWrite.andP;  Thus, there is no automatic way toapply styles to entire elements.andP;  Such a feature would be useful, given thefact that in Write-It the user is always working within the framework ofelements.andM;Its features arc bountiful, but Mark-It's user interface is not one that webelieve many customers will find appealing.andP;  The difficulties of SGML aredaunting to most users.andP;  The challenge for vendors, then, is in designingproducts that reduce that complexity by giving the user visual cues, promptsand plenty of online help.andP;  Mark-It has some of these, but its overall userinterface is akin to the friendliness of WordStar.andP;  It seems designed forpower users but lacks the inviting face that SoftQuad pioneered and IBMadopted.andP;  Without a better user interface, we are unsure how well it willcompete with IBM's TextWrite.andP;  In terms of audience, it has the advantage ofrunning under DOS, but that advantage may be offset by the additionalcapabilities IBM is able to offer through its OS/2-based product.andM;Mark-It parser update.andP;  Yard has also released an update to its parser (knownby many as the Sobemap parser), which may be the one most widely used in theindustry.andP;  The new version adds a complete programming language implementedwithin the link feature of SGML.andP;  The language was described by its developeras much like Snobol; that is, designed for string manipulation.andP;  Yard showedprivate demonstrations of what the language might be used for-one demo evenhad the program drawing rules and boxes within an SGML document.andM;The use of full-fledged programming languages within publishing applicationsis gaining popularity as a means of customizing the application to specificrequirements of users (shades of Interleaf and Bestinfo).andP;  In Yard's case,because its primary customers are oems, we suspect its customers will welcomethis new addition to its parser.andM;Mark Walter</TEXT></DOC>
