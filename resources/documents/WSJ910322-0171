They blitzed the U.S. consumer with sales pitches,collectively spending more than $6 a week on every man, womanand child in the U.S. -- almost 50% more per capita than inany other nation.</LP><TEXT>   In retrospect, too much of it was wasted. Flawed products,inept ad campaigns, misguided gimmicks, poorly monitoredpromotions -- these are the marketing legacies of the decade.Sales receipts often couldn't justify the soaring bills foradvertising and promotion.   Robert Blattberg, a visiting professor of marketing atNorthwestern University, says he frequently hears thismarketers' lament: &quot;I'm spending hundreds of millions ofdollars to advertise, and I get one or two share points forit? It doesn't pay.&quot;   So, in the dawn of a jittery new decade, a tough tacticaland strategic reappraisal is under way. The new resolution:Reap more with less.   &quot;I'm telling my people that every dollar they spend has towork 25% harder than it did in the good old days of endlesssupplies of money,&quot; says Brian Ruder, vice president forconsumer products marketing at H.J. Heinz Co.'s U.S. unit.   Consider Anheuser-Busch Cos. In 10 years, the giantbrewer's selling costs have risen four times faster than theprice of its product; it now spends $9 marketing a barrel ofbeer, compared with $3 in 1980. Thus, as it reappraises itsbehemoth budget, &quot;cost sensitivity and efficiency are thename of the game,&quot; says Michael J. Roarty, who overseesmarketing at Anheuser-Busch. &quot;The days of mass marketing inone media are over.&quot;   Instead, companies in the 1990s are expected to emphasizea number of tactics to sell more efficiently. One obvious wayis to target advertising primarily at likely prospects,rather than just blaring the message to everyone. Companiesalso will be more careful -- before plowing ahead -- inassessing which forms of promotion actually work the best fora particular product.   &quot;We're not able to throw something against the wall and ifit doesn't stick say, fine, we'll try a different kind ofadhesive,&quot; says Subaru of America marketing vice presidentChris Wackman.   Other marketers believe they can achieve greater costeffectiveness if they can establish a lasting dialogue orcloser relationship with their customers. The idea is that itis a lot easier to keep an existing customer than it is tostart from scratch over and over again.   Finally, more companies are increasing their researchactivities to pay closer attention to what customers want. Tothem, the mission of marketing isn't just persuasion, butlearning how to satisfy customer wants. Among other things,the customer demand for quality and reliability of the 1980shas taught companies that it is easier to sell products thatmeet the true needs of consumers.   But none of this will be easy. Particularly cost-cutting.Louis Stern, a marketing professor at NorthwesternUniversity, forecasts &quot;bloody expensive&quot; battles, partlybecause of a slow-growth prognosis for many industries.Growth will mean grabbing market share from someone else.&quot;You'll have people crawling over one another trying tointerest customers in their products,&quot; he says. &quot;They willhave to spend a lot of money to do it.&quot;   Companies, though, feel they have to become morecost-conscious -- if only because the soaring price ofadvertising has made it more difficult to earn a return onmarketing investments. The Big Three networks get much of theblame for this. &quot;Expenditures escalated incredibly during the'80s because of television,&quot; says Mr. Roarty ofAnheuser-Busch.   Even some on Madison Avenue are echoing the criticism. Thepresident of the American Association of AdvertisingAgencies, John O'Toole, calls the networks &quot;the OPEC ofmedia.&quot; He adds: &quot;We saw double-digit increases in rates inthe '80s while losing share and while the memorability of30-second spots was declining.&quot;   Indeed, in 1980 an average 30-second spot on prime-timetelevision cost $57,900. Last year, the average was $122,200-- despite a loss of viewing audience. A.C. Nielsen Co. saysthe average cost to reach 1,000 TV households has more thandoubled, to $9.74 from $3.79 a decade ago. During the sameperiod, the consumer price index rose only 58%.Balking atsoaring prices for network baseball games, Anheuser-Buschrecently signed a $100 million contract with ESPN, the cablesports channel.   Similarly,Nissan Motor Corp. USA turned down sponsorshipof the 1992 Olympic Games because of the cost. Instead, theauto maker signed up with cable's Turner Broadcasting Systemas a sponsor of National Basketball Association games.   But TV isn't the only culprit. During the past decade, thecost-per-thousand &quot;reach&quot; of a full-page color magazine advirtually doubled, to $18.44 from $9.72. Newspapers ratesalso rose rapidly. Editor andamp; Publisher International Yearbookreports that the cost-per-thousand reach of average dailynewspapers rose to $29.22 in 1989 from $14.46 in 1980.   The obvious result from all this: A decade of growingdiscontent over prices.   &quot;We've got a far more fractionated audience inbroadcasting and magazines, and yet costs aren't reflectingthat less delivery of audience,&quot; says L. James Kennedy, vicepresident and corporate director of marketing at ConAgra Inc.&quot;We've got to get back to the days of sitting down eyeball toeyeball and making sure the media understand our viewpoint.&quot;   Many already are backing up such rhetoric with action.Overall advertising expenditures may decline this year -- forthe first time in a decade. &quot;Worse than mediocre,&quot; is oneMadison Avenue agency's description of its outlook.   As companies hold down spending, the only way reachconsumers as frequently is to make sure they aren't throwingmoney at people who aren't good sales candidates. Networktelevision may still be less expensive than some other formsof advertising on a cost-per-thousand basis, but it alsodoesn't offer a very selective audience.   To get closer to their customers, marketers are puttingmore dollars into promotional vehicles that guarantee theywill hit the right audience. Thus, Procter andamp; Gamble Co. isinvesting more of its budget in such alternatives asshopping-cart ads, even as it seeks to restrain marketingexpenses. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has increasedits telemarketing efforts to augment its TV blitz. Tire makerB.F. Goodrich Co. spends nearly a third of its marketingdollars on events like auto races. McDonald's Corp., longwedded to the tube, is giving franchisees greater discretionto buy whatever media works best locally.   As yesterday's mass audience fragments, even traditionalmass marketers are changing tactics. Chewing-gum giant Wm.Wrigley Jr. Co. now considers cable television the key toreaching its crucial 12-to-24-year-old market. &quot;They'rebecoming increasingly difficult to reach through the threebasic network buy,&quot; says Michael J. Hedge, senior vicepresident and director of media services for BBDO Chicago,Wrigley's ad agency. So Wrigley's spots appear on MTV andVH-1, cable's two main video-jukebox channels. And, to tapmore mature markets, Wrigley runs ads for its Freedent gumfor denture wearers on Cable News Network.   Choosing channels, BBDO Chicago looks at an array of data,including relative costs, demographics and the number ofcommercials on the medium. &quot;It's not just the number ofeyeballs you reach but also the environment you reach themin,&quot; Mr. Hedge explains.   Account executives and media buyers at Saatchi andamp; Saatchi'sCampbell-Mithun-Esty agency in Minneapolis went through asimilar exercise recently in deciding how to market HealthyChoice, a line of frozen entrees from ConAgra. A typicalnew-product rollout five years ago would have reliedprimarily on price promotion -- &quot;mass mass mass, cheap,cheap, cheap,&quot; says Karen Murray, associate media director onthe account. &quot;We looked for the computer to spit outefficiency and coverage. We didn't look for a special twistthat we look for now.&quot; Such &quot;special twists&quot; might mean, forinstance, asking a magazine to help set up a promotion forthe food in health clubs -- in return for placing an ad inthe magazine.   Once ads are placed, advertisers today are increasinglyresults-oriented. Like mechanics fine-tuning a race car,Nissan and its agency closely monitor sales and adjust plansaccordingly. One tool they use is a continuous tracking studythat calls for a thousand consumer interviews each month. &quot;Weget week-by-week reporting of how we're doing,&quot; says JohnRinek, Nissan's ad manager. The tracking, which he says is&quot;very expensive,&quot; measures brand awareness, familiarity withparticular vehicle models, commercial recall and what hecalls the &quot;image issue -- how people feel about us.&quot; Ads thatflop can be spotted, and yanked, in short order.   Before Anheuser-Busch shelled out $7 million for thisyear's &quot;Bud Bowl&quot; commercials during the Super Bowl,researchers assembled focus groups and phoned a thousand beerdrinkers nationwide. Did they recall last year's Bud Bowl?Did viewers think the animated containers were clever orsilly? After the Super Bowl, the brewer closely watches salesfigures to see how well the promotion pays off.   This new attention to accountability follows years of &quot;toomany big programs that haven't panned out,&quot; says Al Ries, aStamford, Conn., marketing consultant.   Anheuser's Mr. Roarty likens the marketers' planningprocess today to the construction of an intricate mosaic.Before it is completed, the plan will include such minutedetails as the number of baseball hats a promotion willrequire. &quot;We're getting far more definitive every year,&quot; hesays.   Philip Guarascio, executive director of marketing programsand advertising at General Motors Corp., says, &quot;every productwill have its own individual mix of marketing elements. Theissue will be how much will be spent on direct advertising,on event marketing, on third-party endorsement, and onprice-offs. How those are blended will be key.&quot;   The mix is making for some unusual promotions. ConsiderColgate-Palmolive Co., which lost business during the late1980s after cutting marketing costs to improve profits. Nowthe goal is to rebuild market shares without bloating itsbudget. &quot;Maximize the dollars,&quot; says Edward T. Fogarty,president of Colgate's U.S. operations. &quot;Doing that meanschallenging a lot of the old conventional wisdom aboutnational advertising and promotions.&quot;   Colgate recently defied convention by joining competitorWarner-Lambert Co. in a novel promotion: Buy a tube ofColgate's toothpaste and a bottle of Warner-Lambert'sListerine mouthwash and get a $1.99-value Colgate toothbrushfree. The combination racked up one of the highestdisplay-exposure levels ever, says Colgate promotion directorKeith Jones. He figures the bold move made a nationwidesampling campaign for the toothbrush unnecessary. Estimatedsaving: $15 million.   Data from supermarket scanners is also helping marketersimprove the cost-effectiveness of their promotions. Suchinformation doesn't come cheap, but companies are discoveringthat paying more up front often means less waste later.Analysts at Chicago scanner specialist Information ResourcesInc. reviewed a big Kraft General Foods promotion in 1989 andconcluded that seven of every 10 boxes of its macaroni andcheese would have been sold even without the promotion. Twoof the three incremental-sale boxes moved because of instoredisplays, while the other was purchased with coupons, theresearchers concluded. Since promotion campaigns are pricy,such findings can save plenty.   &quot;The availability of scanner data has caused an explosionin learning how promotion affects purchasing,&quot; says GianFulgoni, Information Resources chairman. It found, forinstance, that while a 40-cent coupon on a tube of toothpastecould yield $147,000 in profits, a 50-cent coupon on the sameitem could mean a $348,000 loss.   At Campbell Soup Co., Ed Russell Jr., the company'sdirector of market research, says scanner analysis revived amajor soup line by persuading company marketers to forgoprice markdowns for more in-store displays.   Companies also believe they can spend their money moreeffectively if they build long-term relationships withconsumers. Pillsbury sends brand-oriented newsletters topeople who, for whatever reason, have contacted the companyabout products. Green Giant vegetable customers get a letterpacked with recipes and nutrition information, as well ascome-ons for new items. Convincing customers that a companycares about them is a &quot;very, very efficient use of dollars,&quot;says John Speirs, senior vice president of marketing atPillsbury Brands, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan PLC.&quot;You have the opportunity to have them shop more of yourtotal line.&quot;   Polishing up old-shoe brand names is another relativelyinexpensive way of enhancing relationships with customers.That's partly why RCA Corp.'s Ammirati andamp; Puris agencyrecently brought back Nipper, RCA's old cock-eared mascot,accompanied by a frisky pup. &quot;A young way of thinking, yetwe're still the old familiar RCA,&quot; says an agency spokesman.   General Motors is trying to do as a corporation what itsbest dealers have been doing for years -- drawing the samebuyers in year after year through continuing contact. Afterall, the average American will spend some $400,000 on carsand related expenses during a lifetime. &quot;If you look at acustomer like that as opposed to a oneshot sale, you dealwith that person in a completely different way,&quot; says Mr.Guarascio.   Rival Ford Co. is chasing the same concept. &quot;Everythingyou do you have to do from a customer standpoint,&quot; says acompany spokesman. To help find out what the customer thinks,Ford sends car and truck buyers a &quot;satisfaction&quot;questionnaire, then follows up with phone inquiries to defusecomplaints.   Packaged-goods companies, meanwhile, are fighting anothersource of budget bloat: new-product introductions. Rollingout a new breakfast cereal can easily consume $30 million inmarketing support. Even then, most products don't survive.   A lot of that money goes into trade promotion -- payingretailers to accept the item, make space on their shelves,program their scanner computers and promote the product.   Trade promotion for established products also takes bigmoney, as manufacturers seek to buy an end-of-the-aisledisplay, pay for grocery ads in newspapers, or put theirproducts &quot;on special.&quot;   For many companies, trade promotion gobbles up far moremarketing dollars than does consumer advertising. By oneestimate, $25 billion was spent on promotions last yearalone. And, as in advertising, promotion is coming underintense scrutiny for potential savings, and accountability.   &quot;You don't know how it's going to be used,&quot; says Mr. Jonesat Colgate. A study by Neo Inc., a sales-analysis concern,found that trade promotion expenditures can typically yield abare 1% return. Often, says Walter Williams, Neo's seniorvice president, marketing, programs are so poorly designed orineptly executed that they actually lose money.   Now, powerhouse companies like Procter andamp; Gamble and KraftGeneral Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., are seeking tostrike &quot;marketing alliances&quot; with their retail counterparts.One goal, industry sources say, is to disclose the totalamount of trade-promotion money available for each product --often a source of uncertainty today -- in exchange forverifiable sales results.   &quot;It's a change in the style of doing business,&quot; says JeffNoddle, senior vice president, marketing, for Super ValuStores Inc., a big food wholesaler based in Hopkins, Minn. Hepredicts that the decade will see more of what he calls&quot;negotiated merchandising&quot; as both manufacturers andretailers seek more marketing flexibility. &quot;It's no longerone-size shoe fits all,&quot; he says.   But some consultants doubt that trade promotion costs willtaper off anytime soon. First, they say most companies assumethe expenditures are necessary to grow -- although they willscrutinize returns more carefully. Second, the way businessworks makes cutbacks extremely difficult.   Robert G. Brown, chief executive officer of Spar Inc., atrade-promotion company, explains that too often workers getpaid for meeting a sales quota, or a chief executive needs tomake an earnings-per-share number, and the easiest way toachieve these goals is to buy the numbers withtrade-promotion dollars. That makes it harder to cut thepromotion budget.   &quot;Rarely do you see people getting fired because theyoverspent their trade-promotion budget,&quot; Mr. Brown says. &quot;Butyou see a lot getting fired because they didn't make theirsales quota.&quot;   ---                    Covering All the Bases                                                                                                          For most marketers, a primary goal is to bombard consumerswith images of their products. The idea is to brand thatproduct into their heads -- on their way to work, while theyread the newspaper, at lunch, while listening to the radio.And so on.   What follows is a rundown of all the ways that just onecompany tries to put its product in the public's eye. Theproduct: Johnnie Walker Red (an eight-year-old scotch) spendsabout $7 million a year on advertising and marketing;Johnnie-Walker Black (a 12-year-old scotch) spends about $6million. About half of the spending is on advertising and therest is divided among merchandising, sales promotions, publicrelations and price promotions. In 1990, sales for JohnnieWalker, a product of Guinness PLC, totaled $290 million --$175 million for Red and $115 million for Black.
