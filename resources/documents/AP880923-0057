(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Internal Revenue Service says PTLcan't pay its bills and has asked a bankruptcy judge to stop theministry's religious broadcasting.   In motions filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the IRS asked JudgeReynolds to act Tuesday to terminate a lease between PTL and its7-week-old spin-off, Heritage Ministries.   The IRS objected to the lease when Reynolds approved it in July.   If Reynolds agrees with the IRS, the ministry's 19-year-old talkshow _ first known as ``The PTL Club,'' later as ``The Jim andTammy Show'' and now as ``Heritage Today'' _ could go off the airwithin a week.   The PTL satellite network is carried by about 900 cable systemsand the ministry has estimated its worth at $15 million.   PTL filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federalbankrupcty code in June 1987, three months after PTL founder JimBakker left following a sex-and-money scandal.   All of PTL's property must be sold to pay creditors. One of thelargest creditors is the IRS, with a $55 million claim.   Reynolds suggested last spring that PTL spin off its religiousfunctions into a separate ministry that would own no property andowe none of PTL's debts. The idea was to give the ministry a chanceto continue after the liquidation of PTL itself.   But Heritage Ministries is in trouble even if Reynolds rejectsthe IRS motion, officials say.   The new ministry's president, Don Edwards, said this week thatcontributions have virtually ceased and that Heritage can't affordto continue another month unless Reynolds grants permission to usemoney from the sale of PTL real estate.   Heritage Ministries was unable to make its first month's rentpayment of $117,000 for the use of PTL's broadcasting and churchfacilities, the IRS said. It also said the ministry owes PTL$125,000 for air time on the PTL satellite network.   Contributions to Heritage Ministries in August were only$703,000. As recently as March, PTL was taking in that much everyweek.   Last Saturday, Heritage Ministries suspended the operations ofits home for unwed mothers and dormitories for homeless,drug-addicted and troubled men.   Reynolds has instructed a federal bankruptcy trustee torecommend a buyer for PTL by Tuesday. Reynolds said he has offersfrom two or three unidentified groups. A bid by Bakker fell apartearlier this month when he couldn't secure financing.   In addition to the ministry, Fort Mill-based PTL owns aChristian theme park, a hotel and land.</TEXT></DOC>
