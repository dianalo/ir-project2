(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Caterpillar Inc. forecast a sharp drop inits second-quarter and 1990 earnings Monday, largely blaming thebusiness impact of Brazil's economic austerity program for hurtingits results.   Caterpillar projected its annual profits will be ``substantiallylower than in 1989,'' when it earned $497 million. The 1989 resultsrepresented a 19 percent drop from the previous year's recordprofit of $616 million.   Revenue is expected to remain flat this year, matching therecord $11.1 billion of 1989.   The Peoria-based maker of farm and industrial equipment said itsresults would be affected adversely by the Brazilian government'sefforts to slow inflation and increase competition.   ``We knew the government's plans to restore Brazil's financialviability would be severe and would cause us some short-termproblems. But we support the government's actions,'' said companyspokesman Richard E. Stober.   Stober said sales volumes would be lower, but higher priceswould compensate for the drop.   Second-quarter results, due out July 20, will be more than 50percent below the $99 million profit in the first quarter, Stobersaid. In the second quarter last year, Caterpillar earned $141million on sales of $2.9 billion.   The first quarter earnings were down 30 percent from the $141million earned during the same period a year earlier, althoughsales improved 10 percent to $2.86 billion.   Stober said sales in Brazil have been relatively strong, but``without any price relief. The government has frozen all theprices, and it appears we will be selling at a loss for the year inBrazil.''   Caterpillar employs 5,100 of its 60,000-member worldwideworkforce at two plants in Brazil.   Workers there build gas, diesel and marine engines, generatorsets, winches, as well as an assortment of wheel loaders, tractorscrapers, bull dozers, rippers, motor graders and track-typetractors.   In 1989, Caterpillar's Latin American territory, includingMexico, Central America and South America, bought $447 million ofequipment manufactured at the company's U.S. factories. Inaddition, Caterpillar sold $382 million worth of products made inLatin America.   Other factors contributing to Caterpillar's profit declineinclude tight U.S. monetary policies and higher inflation, Stobersaid. Also, a costly plant modernization program is taking longerthan expected and costing more than projected.   Caterpillar says that with no further deterioration in the worldeconomy and a more stable economy in Brazil, its profits areexpected to improve in 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
