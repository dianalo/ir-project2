This order is effectiveunder the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 115 handlers of California almonds, and there areapproximately 7,500 producers in the regulated area. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR121.1) as those having average gross annual revenues for the last threeyears of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are definedas those whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majorityof almond handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The marketing order for California almonds requires that the assessmentrate for a particular crop year shall apply to all assessable almonds handledfrom the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses is preparedby the Board and submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval.The members of the Board are handlers and producers of regulated almonds.They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the costs for goods,services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a positionto formulate an appropriate budget. The budget is formulated and discussedin public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunityto participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Board is derived by dividing anticipatedexpenses by expected shipments of assessable almonds. Because that rateis applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate whichwill produce sufficient income to pay the Board's expected expenses. Therecommended budget and rate of assessment are usually acted upon by theBoard shortly after July 1 of each crop year, and expenses are incurredon a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvalsmust be expedited so that the Board will have funds to pay its expenses.The Board met on July 21, 1989, and unanimously recommended 1989-90 marketingorder program expenditures of $12,339,618, and an assessment rate for the1989-90 crop year of 2.75 cents per pound (kernelweight basis). The Boardalso recommended that handlers should be eligible to receive credit fortheir own marketing promotion activities for up to 2.50 cents of this 2.75-cent-per-poundassessment rate. The 2.75-cent-per-pound 1989-90 assessment rate compares with a 1988-89assessment rate of 2.65 cents per pound. While the 2.50-cent-per-poundcreditable rate is the same as the 1988-89 rate, the 0.25-cent per-poundnon-creditable portion of the total assessment, which handlers must payto the Board, is 0.10 cents higher than the 0.15-cent-per-pound 1988-89rate. Projected expenses of $12,339,618 for 1989-90 compare with 1988-89 budgetedexpenses of $16,130,309. Budget categories for 1989-90 are $890,200 foradministrative expenses, $352,018 for production research, $937,700 forpublic relations, and $59,700 for the 1990 crop estimate. Comparable actualexpenditures for the 1988-89 crop were $779,561, $197,101, $996,900, and$56,800, respectively. The remaining $10,100,000 of proposed 1989-90 expensesis the estimated amount which handlers would spend on their own marketingpromotion activities based on a projected 1989-90 marketable Californiaalmond production of 404,000,000 kernelweight pounds and assumes that allhandlers receive full credit against their 2.50-cent-per-pound creditableassessment obligations. For the 1988-89 crop year, $13,925,000 was budgetedfor handler marketing promotion activities based on a projected marketableproduction of 557,000,000 kernelweight pounds. An actual figure is notyet available because handlers have until December 31, 1989, to completemarketing promotion activities for which they may receive credit towardtheir 1988-89 crop year creditable assessment obligations. While this proposed action would impose some additional costs on handlers,the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Someof the additional costs may be passed on to producers. Further, these costswould be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operationof the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determinedthat this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Based on the foregoing, it is found and determined that a comment periodof less than 30 days is appropriate because the budget and assessment rateapproval for this program needs to be expedited. The Board must have sufficientfunds to pay its expenses, which are incurred on a continuous basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 981 </ITAG>Almonds, California, and Marketing agreements and orders.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 981 is proposed tobe amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 981_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
