Patricia Malloy said Monday a decision on a compensation planfor salaried employees in 1989 has not been made. But she said thecompany is reacting to changes in the program which resulted insome employee concern that judgments about their performanceweren't fair.   She said GM has used some form of a pay-for-performance plan forits salaried employees for years.   ``The problem with the modifications made last year was not somuch that it distinguished among employees as much as theperception that some people were judged, in their minds,unfairly,'' Malloy said.   The rankings were created to determine how large a raise, ifany, GM's 114,000 salaried employees should receive. But workerswho learned of the rankings began grumbling that such informationshould not be widely circulated.</TEXT></DOC>
