The far-right Conservative Party stamped its pro-apartheid brand on local government across the country's most-populous province, sweeping to victory in about 70 of the 100 or so white municipalities in Transvaal Province. Prior to the election, the Conservatives controlled only three city councils in a region long dominated by the ruling National Party.    The Nationalists did gain outright control of Johannesburg from the prior coalition-ruled council and narrowly kept Pretoria, the capital, out of Conservative hands. But the Conservatives scored big in the rural and blue-collar heartlands.    Party leader Andries Treurnicht said the Conservatives now will set their sights on grabbing national power in the next parliamentary election, which may be held next year.    In the black elections, anti-apartheid organizations proved that they still wield considerable influence despite a 28-month-old state of emergency designed to crush black opposition. Their call for a boycott of the election generally was heeded.    In Soweto, the country's largest black township with some two million people, only about 28,000 voters cast ballots, about 10% of those eligible. And most of those who did vote did so during the two-week &quot;prior voting&quot; system set up to avoid intimidation; on election day, fewer than 10,000 Sowetans ventured to the polls. In Port Elizabeth, one of the country's most militant black areas, only 9% of those eligible actually voted.    (Tamsanqa Linda, who was the subject of a Wall Street Journal page-one story on Wednesday, lost his bid for re-election as mayor of Port Elizabeth's black townships.)    The government was quick to put a favorable spin on the results. Various ministers pointed out that the Conservative Party's success was confined largely to the Transvaal, and they claimed to be delighted with the black turnout, which they said was about 30% nationwide. This figure is based on the number of registered voters in wards where there was a contest (about one-third of the black candidates were unopposed). Based on total eligible voters, however, the black turnout was less than 20%.    Local government is crucial to Pretoria's plans to erect a new constitutional structure from the &quot;bottom up,&quot; in which blacks will participate in various levels of government without having a vote on the national level. The municipal elections were to serve as the foundation by electing blacks to city councils. From there, according to government strategy, they will be drawn into regional and provincial bodies, and then, ultimately, to a national advisory council.    But political analysts said the election results portend a future of constitutional stalemate and political confrontation. They said the Conservative victories likely will act as a brake on the government's tentative steps toward integration. And the black opposition, which rendered the townships ungovernable during the unrest of the mid-1980s, will continue to discredit Pretoria's moves to re-establish local government until the black majority is given equal political rights on all levels of government, the analysts said.    Since the imposition of the state of emergency in June 1986 and the subsequent detention of thousands of black activists and banning of many anti-apartheid organizations, Pretoria has spent millions of dollars in a strategy dubbed WHAM -- winning hearts and minds. The money went to upgrading roads, housing and sewage systems in the townships. The government also spent some $2 million on advertising exhorting people to vote in the municipal elections. But the black turnout indicates the WHAM strategy hasn't worked as designed.    Now, the government also will have to contend with the Conservative Party in local government, at least in the Transvaal. The Conservatives will be in control of many of the province's Regional Services Councils, which are multiracial bodies responsible for community development. The Conservatives have threatened to block all attempts to spend money on upgrading projects in the black townships.    Also, the Conservative-dominated councils will be intent on adhering to a strict segregation of the races and will roll back any past moves by the National Party to open local facilities to all races. </TEXT></DOC>
