<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-29-0679 </DOCNO><TEXT>The absorption coefficient and band gap for CuInSe/sub 2/ thin-films arederived from transmission and reflection data in the near infrared (NIR)spectrum, 2000 nm to 740 nm, and are determined to be in the range 2-6x10/sup4/ cm/sup -1/ and .94-1.02 eV, respectively. Measurements are made forseveral film compositions ranging from 18.7 at .% to 26.0 at .% Cu, withSe/metal ratio of about 1.0. A mild dependency of {alpha} and energy-gapon composition is observed.</TEXT></DOC>
