<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0174 </DOCNO><TEXT>Four laboratory leaching methods (the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) extraction procedure, ATSM method D3987, and two column tests)were used to extract leachates from four low-void retorted oil shalesto 1) compare the leaching procedures based on the chemical characterizationof leachates derived from leaching method and 2) establish the toxicityof each leachate relative to published EPA water quality criteria. TheEPA extraction procedure extracted the greatest concentration of traceelements of the methods tested. None of the concentrations of the sevenmetals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, chronium, lead, selenium, and silver)selected from those listed in the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA) exceeded the RCRA limits defining a hazardous waste. On thatbasis, the low-void retorted oil shales would not be classified as hazardous.</TEXT></DOC>
