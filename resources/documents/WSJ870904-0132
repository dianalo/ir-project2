Standardized test scores have stopped plummeting, but remain at a low level despite a rising awareness that an educated work force is important to the international competitiveness of U.S. industry.    Efforts at school reform have focused on introducing more competition and consumer choice. Not much has come of the Reagan administration's early hopes for voucher systems. But private firms have resorted more and more to their own remedial training, providing an ad hoc answer to the failures of the public school monopoly.    When New York Telephone Co. launched its first large-scale recruiting effort in years this spring, it found some 84% of its New York city applicants failing entry-level exams in English and problem-solving. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers suggest that such inadequacies will create more serious problems. Of the 21 million additional jobs the U.S. economy is expected to generate between now and the year 2000, a high percentage will demand verbal, mathematical and reasoning skills.    Corporate solutions are proceeding apace. Some 1,700 of Polaroid's employees -- approximately one-third of the firm's hourly workers -- are studying in a program that teaches them kindergarten through 12th-grade skills. The number of such students has tripled since 1985, and the company stresses the program's necessity. &quot;We don't do this to be nice guys,&quot; a spokeswoman says.    Since 1977, Adolph Coors's &quot;Golden Door&quot; program has trained 112 chronically unemployable citizens, such as former drug addicts, to work at the firm.    GE recently has shifted its emphasis in philanthropy from teacher training to students. In June it announced a million-dollar program to improve pre-college standards in Lowndes County, Ala., where it has a new plastics plant requiring a high-tech work force. Time Inc. and CBS Magazines recently revoked their support for a high-school writing program because of their unhappiness with the way school officials were running it. When New York area banks offered 250 jobs to city high-school graduates, the public system was able to come up with only 100 acceptable candidates.    IBM says its support for education isn't specifically designed to provide the company with recruits. But it is spending about $18 million, or one-fifth of its educational budget this year, on training centers in inner-cities that give young people starter skills from telephone etiquette to math. It now has 71 such centers, up from eight in 1982. It sees this rise as &quot;an identification of the problem.&quot;    Many firms haven't yet made the conceptual jump from general philanthropy in education to applied teaching for their own employees. They see their programs as mainly corporate citizenship endeavors. Prudential trained 400 underachievers and made 150 of them job offers in a remedial training program that was part of the settlement of an employment-practices dispute with the Labor Department. But Prudential, as with some other firms, says it really doesn't want to &quot;get into the education business.&quot;    Regardless of how they describe their spending, though, corporations are already party to a private education contract. A Conference Board report shows that since 1978, more corporate dollars have gone to education than to any other category of beneficiary. About 70% to 75% of that money still goes to college-level institutions.    David T. Kearns, CEO at Xerox, has been a leading spokesman for industry concerns. Xerox isn't spending much on remedial education now. And Mr. Kearns estimates that remedial education currently accounts for only about 1% of all corporate education philanthropy. But he points to an American Society for Training and Development study that predicts industry may have to spend as much as $25 billion a year on remedial education in the future.    Efficiency here depends in large part on how soon states, the U.S. government, parents and companies recognize to what extent market forces are already at work in the delivery of education. One way or another, the market will come into play in education as it does elsewhere, producing alternatives if the public sector doesn't improve its performance. </TEXT></DOC>
