Since civil war erupted full-force in Lebanon in early March,diplomats at the embassy in Christian-controlled East Beirut were incontact with Moslem-controlled West Beirut only by telephone, saidGeorge Malleck, a State Department spokesman.   The eight American captives in Lebanon are believed to be held bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslems, all linked to the Hezbollah umbrellagroup.   Another State Department official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the diplomats were ``limited in their movements'' inLebanon, confined primarily to the embassy compound and theirapartments.   Neil Livingstone, a private consultant who has writtenextensively about the hostages, said it was doubtful embassypersonnel had much to do with the hostage situation. ``The optionsand decisions to be made are done in Washington. They are done at ahigh level,'' he said.   Any indirect contacts with hostage-holders or their Iraniansponsors usually take place in European capitals, he said.   Ambassador John McCarthy and 29 American diplomats were evacuatedby helicopter Tuesday.   On Friday, McCarthy met with Secretary of State James A Baker IIIto discuss the situation in Lebanon where heightened hostilitieshave claimed the lives of 827 people over the last six months. U.S.diplomats fled, first shredding documents and destroying electroniccoding equipment, after Christian factions besieged the embassy,claiming that the Americans had not done enough to protect from theSyrian army and its Moslem allies.   Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa., the brother of hostage JosephCicippio, said the family had heard nothing about the captives, butthey were worried. ``We just have to keep our fingers crossed,'' hesaid.   Joseph Cicippio's wife, a Lebanese-born woman employed at theembassy, continued to work with other foreign nationals who stayedto run the embassy compound, officials said. Thomas Cicippio said hehad not been in touch with his sister-in-law because of thedifficulty in making telephone calls. Regular mail service also issporadic.   The American aid program, most of it consisting of food and othersupplies, is in the hands of local private voluntary organizations.The program totalled about $16 million in the fiscal year that endsthis month.   Cicippio, 58, was threatened with death, but granted a reprievein early August, shortly after a group calling itself theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth released a videotape showingLt. Col. William R. Higgins in a noose. American officials confirmedthe picture showed Higgins, but his corpse has not been returned.   Livingstone said the hostages are moved around among various safehouses, probably no more than a dozen, operated by the captors. Atdifferent times, the hostages reportedly have been held in thesouthern suburbs of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley, northeast ofBeirut.   President Bush focused on the hostage issue in early August afterthe death of Higgins, prompting a flurry of optimism about theirpossible release. When none were released, the Bush administrationtook another tack, announced that it would lower the decibel ondiscussions about the hostages.   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let these issuesplay out for a few days and see what happens,'' Bush spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said on Aug. 11.   In an interview published Tuesday in The Washington Post, SheikMohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of the ShiiteMoslems in Lebanon, said Bush would have to make the first gestureof good will toward Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
