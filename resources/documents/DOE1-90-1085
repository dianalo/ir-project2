Using the total current method, the role of space chargein the bunching of accelerated electrons is taken into account. Expressionsare obtained for spectral composition of the output convection current,limiting values of flight angle, the length of accelerating space, aswell as the density of current from cathode, at which complete debunchingof electron beams at the output of the space takes place. It is shownthat the limiting length of the accelerator and limiting convection currentdensity do not depend on modulating signal. The limiting current densityfor certain cases is estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
