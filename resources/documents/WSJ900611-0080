With surprisingly little debate and lessdeliberation, Congress and the administration have all butagreed to take Social Security out of the officialcalculation of the budget deficit. &quot;We're going to takeSocial Security off budget,&quot; says Sen. Pete Domenici, a NewMexico Republican. &quot;There's no doubt.&quot;   Many Democrats and some Republicans talk about balancingthe budget over the next several years without counting theannual Social Security surplus. But considering theirinability to make progress toward a balanced budget even withthe $63 billion Social Security surplus, it's a pipe dream.&quot;Macho talk,&quot; says House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, aCalifornia Democrat.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, in the Washington political hothouse,rhetoric has a way of driving policy, and the rhetoricsurrounding Social Security is thick. Sen. Daniel Moynihan, aNew York Democrat, started all this when he accused hiscolleagues and the president of &quot;thievery&quot; by relying on theregressive Social Security payroll tax to fund otheroperations. The competition to talk tough on Social Securityhas escalated since.                                                                                                          This isn't simply a matter of accounting. Some experts towhom Democrats usually turn say that taking Social Securityoff budget could prove to be the biggest blunder Democratsmake this year. While politicians love to proclaim that theyhave &quot;protected&quot; Social Security, these experts look beyondoratory and don't like what they see. &quot;Democrats are shootingthemselves in the foot by supporting this,&quot; asserts IsabelSawhill of the Urban Institute.                                                                                                          For one thing, segregating Social Security would makecutting the deficit much tougher. The program is at the rootof the surge in spending of the past two decades -- from 15%of the budget in 1970 to 21% today. Budget experts long haveassumed that any deficit fix would include restraint in thegrowth of benefits for older folk.   By removing Social Security from deficit totals, however,the budget summiteers would eliminate any incentive to trimthe program. &quot;If it's not part of the problem, it's not partof the solution,&quot; says Robert Reischauer, director of theCongressional Budget Office. So much for promises aboutsharing the sacrifice of deficit reduction.   Social Security beneficiaries won't object, of course. Butwith such a big piece of the budget exempt, the rest of itwould get squeezed all the harder to reduce the deficit.Higher taxes and lower defense spending wouldn't suffice;popular spending programs such as the war on drugs andfederal aid to education would surely suffer. Congressionaladvocates of taking Social Security out of the budget &quot;don'trealize what a terrific crimp it'll put on domesticspending,&quot; Ms. Sawhill says.   Moreover, removing Social Security from the budget mightweaken rather than strengthen the hallowed trust fund.Currently, Congress can't tap Social Security funds withoutincreasing the deficit and risking the Gramm-Rudman law'sacross-the-board spending cuts; this has kept Congress fromraising benefits for certain age groups or using SocialSecurity taxes to pay for long-term health care.   If Social Security is removed from the budget, however,the limited discipline of the Gramm-Rudman law woulddisappear. Mr. Reischauer says the Social Security trust fundcould become a &quot;honey pot&quot; that legislators would dip into toprovide more benefits to seniors, weakening the trust fund'sability to cope with baby-boomer retirees in the nextcentury.                                                                                                          To take Social Security off budget could be a recipe forthe failure of the budget summit. The spending cuts and taxincreases required to balance the budget without SocialSecurity anytime soon could prove politically impossible. Forthis reason, White House Budget Director Richard Darman keepsurging the summit to agree on a deficit-reduction package andthen to write new accounting rules to accommodate it.                                                                                                          Given the pitfalls, why is Congress so determined to takethis step?   Many members want to boast that they've protected SocialSecurity without having to vote for the costly payroll taxcut proposed by Sen. Moynihan. And some Republicans suspectthat Democrats are trying to make the deficit look huge soPresident Bush will have to raise taxes. Another theory hasDemocrats using the Social Security move as a wedge to weakenor eliminate the Gramm-Rudman law and thus avoid the pain ofdeficit-reduction altogether.   Conventional wisdom to the contrary, politicians often dowhat they promise. But if they take Social Security offbudget, they may come to regret it.   ---       The Deficit, With or Without Social Security                                                                                                                        (In billions of dollars)                                                                                                                                        WITH            WITHOUT   FISCAL                   SOCIAL SECURITY  SOCIAL SECURITY   YEAR                        SURPLUS           SURPLUS                                                                                                          1990                         $155.0            $218.3   1991                          137.9             214.7   1992                          128.7             215.8   1993                           90.7             194.2   1994                           60.5             180.0   1995                           31.6             164.2                                                                                                          Note: Deficit projections exclude spending on thriftindustry bailout   Source: Office of Management and Budget, May 1990</TEXT></DOC>
