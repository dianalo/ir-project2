One or the other would be closed.   Willow Run sits in the heart of car country. It'srelatively cheap to ship parts into Willow Run and cars out,giving the Michigan plant a huge $325-a-car edge in freightcosts over Arlington, which is 1,000 miles south of Detroit.</LP><TEXT>   But that distance ultimately worked to Arlington'sadvantage. It left lots of space between the factory andSolidarity House, headquarters of the United Auto Workersunion. That had a lot to do with why, last week, Arlingtonbeat long odds to emerge as the winner. Willow Run is now setto close in 1993.   Arlington's 3,200 workers flouted UAW headquarters tooffer GM a package making it cheaper to build cars there thanat Willow Run. Local union officials gave Arlington a runningstart in the survival race by calling a plant-wide &quot;crisisplanning&quot; meeting a week before GM announced that the plant'sfuture was on the line.   Thus, the day that announcement came, Dec. 18, Arlington'sworkers voted to allow a three-shift schedule to build carsround the clock without overtime pay. The workers also voted,among other things, to give management more authority toassign jobs in the plant's paint shop. Workers at Willow Run,meanwhile, didn't offer GM much of anything.   &quot;The world is smaller, there's a lot more competition, andanybody who didn't realize that in the 1980s just wasn'tlooking,&quot; says Michael Sieler, the top UAW official at theArlington plant, near Dallas.   Some still aren't looking. Ever since GM announced itsdecision, Willow Run's defeat has been treated as a bigmystery in Michigan. UAW leaders have blamed state officials.Some have even speculated that President Bush could haveintervened to save a plant in his home state. The White Houseand GM call that notion ridiculous.   Rather, worker attitudes made the real difference. Byselecting Arlington, GM strongly signaled that workercooperation will determine which factories will -- and whichwon't -- survive the extensive downsizing the company plans(cutting out 21 plants and 74,000 employees) between now and1995.   &quot;Innovative labor agreements and work arrangements aregoing to be part of our decisions,&quot; said Robert C. Stempel,GM's chairman, on the day he announced Arlington's victoryand Willow Run's demise. GM, he added, will ask each factory:&quot;Can you improve the productivity of your operations, can youimprove costs, can you improve quality?&quot;   UAW leaders knew either Arlington or Willow Run would haveto close, but the circumstances of Arlington's victory havemade them livid. GM is &quot;playing with fire&quot; by trying to pitplant against plant, says Stephen P. Yokich, the combativeleader of the union's GM department. Last week he threatenedstrikes at some of GM's most critical facilities. And thisweek, the union's executive board huddled to devisestrategies to keep workers from competing against each other.   For Solidarity House, long a stronghold of organized laborin America, this is a time of trial. The UAW already islocked in a bitter, four-month strike against CaterpillarInc. At issue: the company's demand for concessions onhealth-care benefits and for a two-tier wage scale that wouldpay new workers less. Agreeing to those items would break thefarm-equipment industry pattern the union already hasnegotiated with Deere andamp; Co.   &quot;Part of the reason the UAW has dug in at Caterpillar isthat it doesn't want to establish a precedent for breakingpattern,&quot; says Harley Shaiken, a labor-relations expert atthe University of California at Berkeley. &quot;GM, Ford andChrysler are very closely watching what is happening atCaterpillar.&quot;   With good reason. The International Union of ElectricalWorkers, which represents workers at a GM truck plant inMoraine, Ohio, agreed to major concessions in January. A newpact pays new hires less than current employees.   Wages and benefits weren't an issue in the Arlington vs.Willow Run contest, but work rules were. Solidarity House hasallowed several GM plants to adopt flexible work rules, butonly after GM approached top union leaders about it. Facedwith a union election this year and Big Three contract talksin 1993, UAW leaders fear they may lose control of theprocess if individual plants cut their own deals with GM andask headquarters approval as an afterthought.   &quot;The stakes are very high,&quot; Mr. Shaiken says. &quot;Whathappens next could influence labor relations for years tocome.&quot;   Consider the attitude of Arlington's Mr. Sieler. He sayshe gets along fine with Solidarity House -- but adds thatlocal union leaders must seize the initiative to save theirfactories. &quot;Steve Yokich isn't going to come down here andthrow me out of office,&quot; he declares. &quot;He doesn't vote forme. My members vote for me.&quot;   Self-preservation has guided the Texas local all along. Inearly December, UAW leaders in Arlington concluded there wasonly enough demand for the full-size, rear-wheel-drive carsbuilt here and at Willow Run to keep one of the factoriesopen. That meant they would have to win the work in a contestwith their brothers up north.   Arlington, unlike Willow Run, had faced extinction before.In 1985 GM said it would stop building the Chevy Monte Carloat the plant and close it. The day was saved only whenworkers voted to adopt a &quot;team concept&quot; approach to theirwork.   This time Mr. Sieler, as shop chairman, and David Perdue,president of Local 276, joined forces with Arlington plantmanager Art Hester. On Dec. 11, the three men called ameeting of the 1,800 first-shift workers in the plant'scavernous &quot;People Center.&quot; Mr. Hester spoke first.   He told the group that orders for the Chevrolet Capriceand the Buick Roadmaster, built at both Arlington and WillowRun, seemed stuck at around half the level needed to run bothplants. GM probably would close one of the plants soon.   Then Messrs. Sieler and Perdue implored the workers tovote to authorize the the plant's union leaders to negotiatework-rule changes with GM. &quot;We had to make something happen,&quot;Mr. Sieler says.   Permission to adopt a three-shift production system wascrucial. It would enable GM to use the factory fully withoutcostly overtime. The company uses the three-shift system atthree European plants, and it's one reason GM of Europe ishugely profitable, in contrast to the company's loss-riddendomestic business.   The paint-shop changes also were important. Previously,Arlington workers had plant-wide &quot;bumping&quot; rights, meaningthat high-seniority workers could replace those with lowertenure anywhere in the factory in case of a layoff. Sometimesthat meant senior assembly workers would be operatingpainting equipment they didn't know how to use, hurtingquality and efficiency. But with the change, senior workersfrom other departments can't bump others out of the paintshop.   Arlington's white-collar employees used the changes tochart a course for making the plant profitable. They alsopointed out to GM headquarters that their cars had fewerdefects; Arlington averages 3.5 defects per car, GM sourcessay, while Willow Run has averaged five defects a car.   Arlington's managers also argued that, by keeping theirplant open, GM could save the cost of moving the tools tobuild the Cadillac Brougham. It's built at Arlington, but notat Willow Run.   Meanwhile, Union Pacific Corp., not wanting to losefreight business, offered to cut its rates to the Arlingtonplant. The railroad won't specify the amount, but &quot;we triedto encourage them to use their Arlington plant,&quot; a spokesmansays.   State and local officials also took action. ArlingtonMayor Richard Green, who owns a Chevrolet dealership, calledan emergency meeting of the city council and gave all eightcouncil members assignments. He assigned one to expedite atax abatement analysis, and another to step up work todesignate the factory an enterprise zone. The Texans wound upoffering GM $30 million in tax breaks.   Government officials also bragged to GM about theirweather. That point hit home when Willow Run was forced toclose for two days in January following the worst snowstormto hit southeast Michigan in a decade. Meanwhile, Texas Gov.Ann Richards journeyed to Detroit in January for the footballplayoff game between the Detroit Lions and the DallasCowboys. The Lions mauled the Cowboys 38-6, but the governorwedged in some schmoozing with GM officials present.   Throughout all this, union leaders at Willow Run remainedconfident of victory. &quot;When it's all said and done, WillowRun will be building cars,&quot; Jerry Clifton, the union's topofficial at the plant, told a reporter one week before thedecision was announced. &quot;You can't get the numbers to add upto Arlington being more profitable than Willow Run.&quot;   Mr. Clifton figured that Arlington could never overcomethe handicap of its location, and he wasn't alone. As farback as 1988, an internal GM &quot;plant competitiveness&quot; studygave Willow Run a 4.1 rating on a five-point scale, whileArlington ranked second to last with a 1.5. Shipping costswere the big difference.   But that study also listed such &quot;assumptions&quot; as identicallabor practices and, lower on the list, unchanged propertytax rates. Arlington simply attacked and overturned theassumptions.   Which is why, in late January, a 20-member GM task forceled by Thomas Spielman, a mid-level executive, crunched thenumbers and recommended keeping Arlington. Lloyd E. Reuss,GM's president, ordered many of the primary conclusionsdouble-checked. The conclusion held up.   As decision day grew near, Willow Run's union leaderssignaled to GM a general willingness to negotiate three-shiftproduction and other changes. But it was too little, toolate.   Essentially, when GM picked Arlington, it chose workerslike James Heath, who has worked at the factory for 15 yearsbut waited eight years to join the union. &quot;The key thing isgetting along with management,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem with alot of unionists is that they don't look at this as abusiness. They don't think GM is in business to make money,but to provide union members with a good, steady source ofincome.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
