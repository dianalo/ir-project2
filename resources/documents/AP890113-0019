James D. Watkins is scramblingback to his battle station three years after ending a sparkling41-year Navy career. But this time the threat is a homegrown crisisinstead of a foreign power.   He was nominated Thursday by President-elect Bush to head theEnergy Department, which has been rocked by a partial shutdown ofthe nuclear plants that produce the nation's atomic warheads and bythe prospect of devoting tens of billions of dollars to rebuildingand cleaning up the aging nuclear complex.   Watkins, 61, has no background in the commercial energy field,but he has been associated with the Navy's nuclear operations sinceearly in his career, which was capped by a four-year stint as chiefof naval operations, the top Navy officer.   In 1958, Watkins studied nuclear engineering at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,National Laboratory, one of the links in the nationwide nuclearbomb-making network. He later taught at Navy nuclear trainingcenters and worked in the Naval Reactors Division of the AtomicEnergy Commission, a forerunner of the Energy Department.   At a news conference following the announcement of his nominationas energy secretary, Watkins said grappling with the nuclear weaponsplants problem would be his ``first order of business'' before hisSenate confirmation hearings start.   Watkins' selection came just hours after President Reaganformally endorsed an Energy Department report recommending that $81billion be spent over the next two decades to modernize the nuclearbomb factories. It acknowledged that budget constraints would makeit difficult to carry out the plan.   One of the most immediate threats posed by the nuclear weaponsplant problem is the possibility that the United States could runlow on tritium, a short-lived radioactive gas that Energy Departmentreactors produce for atomic warheads.   Last year, the last of the tritium-producing reactors was shutdown for safety reasons, leaving the country at least temporarilywithout fresh supplies of the gas.   The Pentagon has said the reactors must be restarted soon inorder to avoid jeopardizing the nation's nuclear arsenal, butofficials have not said just when the problem would become critical.No date has been set for restarting the tritium-producing reactors,although Reagan's report said it was unlikely before late 1989.   Even once the key reactors are made safe and put back intooperation, the new energy secretary will face great uncertainty overwhether and when to build a new generation of tritium-producingplants. The existing ones are more than 30 years old. Reagan'sreport called them obsolete and in need of replacement.   A related, and perhaps more long-lasting, problem is finding thetechnology _ and the money _ to clean up the widespreadenvironmental damage caused by four decades of bomb-making.   Energy industry officials welcomed the selection of Watkins,although his name was not among the many that had churned throughWashington rumor mills in recent weeks.   ``Adm. Watkins has demonstrated his ability as a leader andadministrator,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the AmericanPetroleum Institute, representing major oil companies.   Other officials urged Watkins to tackle the military reactorsproblem immediately.   ``It is especially important that this national security issue behandled skillfully ... so it does not become an abiding distractionto other energy issues,'' said George H. Lawrence, president of theAmerican Gas Association, a trade group.   Although the nuclear problem is likely to give Watkins his mostimmediate headaches, the new energy secretary will face challengeson other fronts. Among them are:   _An emerging battle in Congress over whether to raise the federalgasoline tax as a way of curbing gasoline consumption and cuttingthe federal budget deficit. Debate over a possible tax on oilimports also is likely to heighten this year.   _A growing wave of oil imports that has increased concern aboutU.S. dependence on OPEC. Some economists and members of Congresshave said the government should act now to insulate the nationbetter against a supply disruption _ particularly in the volatileMiddle East _ that could force up oil prices.   _Calls by the natural gas industry for ending all controls on gasprices. Consumer groups are opposed.   _Deciding whether to open up more federal lands in Alaska andelsewhere for oil and gas exploration. Conservations are stronglyopposed; the oil companies say such additional exploration is vitalto halting a recent slide in domestic oil production.</TEXT></DOC>
