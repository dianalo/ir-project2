Norman, the entrepreneur who co-foundedBusinessland, created a fortune for his investors, then nearly lost it all.JWP said that Norman &quot;will maintain a consulting role with the newoperation.&quot;;    JWP, based in Purchase, N.Y., will merge the financiallytroubled retailer with its computer systems group to form the world's largestcompany-owned computer-distribution operation.;    The takeover by JWP, one ofthe industry's most efficient retailers, portends more painful cuts forBusinessland, the least efficient of the major computer distributors. JWPofficials said Monday they plan to eliminate jobs and consolidate facilitiesat Businessland to bring down costs.;    JWP said it would reduce theworkforce of the new organization by 10 percent to 20 percent. Most of thecuts among the 3,500 employees of the combined unit are likely to come fromBusinessland's administrative operations.;    &quot;It's very important we movequickly,&quot; said Harold D. Copperman, who was named president of the mergedunit, which will be known as JWP Businessland. &quot;We will begin to get immediatecost savings.&quot;;    Copperman said JWP Businessland will be based in Canton,Mass., home of JWP's computer systems group. Many of the functions performedby Businessland headquarters in San Jose will be shifted to Canton, he said.;   In the process, about half of the 350 jobs at the San Jose headquarters arelikely to eliminated, according to Robert J. Crowell, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of JWP Businessland.;    &quot;We are designing the mostefficient organization possible,&quot; Crowell said. &quot;We want to streamlineoperations.&quot;;    The only function that seems certain to remain in San Jose isBusinessland's catalog sales operation.;    Crowell and Copperman unveiled thenew name and logo of the combined company in New York Monday and discussedtheir plans for a swift transition. JWP already has placed full-page ads inThe Wall Street Journal and other major daily newspapers around the country tointroduce the new identity and reassure Businessland customers of the unit'sfinancial stability.;    Businessland's heavy losses during last the yearresulted in the cancellation of credit arrangements and a brush withinsolvency in May. The company's problems stalled sales and causedBusinessland's key customers to reconsider their relationship with the firm.;   &quot;We were very concerned about the potential erosion of customer accounts,&quot;Crowell said. The announcement of JWP's tender offer in May &quot;stabilized thesituation&quot; and limited the loss of business, he said.;    &quot;Customers realizedthat a company with a lot of financial strength and stability was coming in,&quot;Crowell said.;    After the merger, JWP will have annual sales of about $4billion. Sales of the JWP Businessland unit should total about $1.8 billion.;   JWP must overcome many problems to transform Businessland into an efficientcompetitor, industry analysts said.;    William Y. Tauscher, chairman andchief executive officer of Computerland Inc. of Pleasanton, another majorcomputer retailer, said in a statement, &quot;It remains to be seen whether JWPwill ever be able to successfully turnaround Businessland's operations andintroduce the distribution efficiencies and back-end management systemscritical to survival in today's price-sensitive, support-intensive market.&quot;;   Computerland made an offer to buy Businessland while JWP was trying tocomplete its deal, but the Computerland offer was quickly rejected.;    JWPhas managed four previous acquisitions very successfully to create anextremely efficient retailer. The company has prospered by concentratingprimarily on discount direct sales to the county's largest corporations. Thecompany avoided expensive real estate and costly services.;    Businesslandinitially sought to win customers among the country's largest corporations byproviding a higher level of service than other computer retailers -- astrategy that entailed additional expenses.;    The 9-year-old companycontinued to provide its costly services at a time when most its largecorporate clients simply wanted to buy personal computers at the lowestpossible price. Over the past few quarters, Businessland has struggled tobring its costs down by cutting jobs and shedding expensive office and retailspace. The firm has not been able to pare costs fast enough to matchcompetitors, however.;    In announcing its plans for Businessland, JWP alsoidentified senior executives who will be managing the merged unit. Copperman,who was named president, joined JWP in June after two years as president ofCommodore Business Machines Inc. He had been vice president and generalmanagerof Apple Computer's eastern operations group from 1987 to 1989 after 20 yearswith IBM.;    The only senior executive from Businessland included in the newmanagement team is Barry Cioffi, senior vice president of customer services,who has been overseeing Businessland's service operations. SeveralBusinessland executives cleaned out their offices and left the company overthe weekend.;    JWP's latest tender offer, which eliminated a requirementthat allowed Businessland bondholders to block the deal, expired at midnightFriday. JWP said Monday that nearly two-thirds of Businessland shareholdershad tendered their stock by the deadline. JWP said it will begin Aug. 9 toexchange $32.4 million in cash and JWP securities for the 32.4 million sharesof Businessland stock.; THE SELLING OF BUSINESSLAND; (box)May 14 -- After aseries of quarterly losses, Businessland says its lenders are cutting offfunds to finance inventory.
