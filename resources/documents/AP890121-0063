An army spokesman said a Palestinian was killed early today bysoldiers in the West Bank village of Yatta, 10 miles south ofJerusalem, but the spokesman could not confirm whether the manworked as a bodyguard.   Military sources said an Israeli-made Uzi machine gun was foundnext to the body of the Palestinian man. The army routinely givesweapons to pro-Israeli Palestinian figures.   Arab reporters, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identifiedthe dead man as Yasser Karaish, 28, and said he was a bodyguard forYatta's Israeli-appointed mayor, Ismaeel Abu Hemeid.   The reports said a small crowd of young Palestinian nationalistsgathered in front of Hemeid's home early today and began shoutingslogans accusing him of collaborating with Israel. When the groupbegan to throw stones at his house, Hemeid called his armedbodyguards and the Israeli army.   Israeli troops rushed to the scene, saw Palestinians with guns infront of Hemeid's home and opened fire, accidentally killingKaraish, Arab reporters said. It was not immediately clear whatKaraish was doing when he was shot.   Military sources said Israeli troops opened fire after being shotat several times. An army spokesman said the military has sealed offthe village and is investigating the incident.   The Arab reporters said the Israeli soldiers apparently thoughtthe bodyguards were members of a Palestinian strike force.   On Thursday, a group calling itself the Palestinian Popular Armyissued a leaflet calling for attacks on soldiers and Jewish settlers.   The PLO claims it is forming strike forces in villages and townsthroughout the occupied territories under the command of Force-17, aunit of Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the PLO. There havebeen no reported incidents of group members firing guns at Israelitroops.   More than a dozen Palestinians have been killed by their fellowArabs for cooperating with the Israeli military.   On Friday, the deaths of two alleged collaborators were reported.   Ahmed Jeredat, 36, was killed Thursday night by a shot in theface in the West Banmk village of Atil, and Mohammed Irut, 18, diedFriday of wounds sustained in a Jan. 12 shooting in Nablus.   Reporters said Jeredat was a shopkeeper who cooperated with theIsraeli government and Irut was from a family closely linked withthe authorities.   Also today, a 60-year-old man was wounded in the neck in theoccupied Gaza Strip after troops opened fire with plastic bullets todisperse stone-throwing youths. On Friday, Defense Minister YitzhakRabin gave troops permission to fire plastic bullets atstone-throwers and Arabs setting up roadblocks.   Fifteen Palestinians were wounded Friday in violence in the WestBank and Gaza Strip.
