The Soviet government retaliated Wednesday for Canada's actionby kicking out two Canadian diplomats and telling three others theyare not welcome.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported late Wednesday thatsome of the Soviets who were expelled had attempted to infiltrateParamax Electronics, a U.S.-owned military contractor in Montrealthat has access to highly classified U.S. naval technology.   The CBC reported on its late-night television program, TheJournal, that Paramax had access to highly classified radar, sonarand and communications systems.   The New York Times said in its Thursday edition that thetechnology to which Paramax has access included computer-drivenequipment that controls shipboard weapons systems.   Paramax, a subsidiary of the Detroit-based Unisys Corporation,has a $1 billion contract with the Canadian government as theprimary subcontractor on a fleet of six newpatrol frigates for theCanadian navy, the Times reported. Unisys is one of the largestmilitary contractors in the United States.   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark told Parliament that eightSoviet diplomats were expelled last week and another nine diplomatsand officials who recently left the country have been told theyshould not return.   Clark said there was not one conspiracy but several operationsthat formed the object of ``parallel but distinct investigations.''   He said the Soviets' transgressions included an attempt topenetrate the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and itspredecessor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service.   ``We are confident that Canadian security was not compromised,''Clark said.   He said the Soviet diplomats also tried to gain access toclassified information and technology with commercial and militaryapplications.   Clark said a Soviet official at the International Civil AviationOrganization headquarters in Montreal, identified as Yuri Smurov,has defected and asked to remain in Canada with his wife anddaughter after supplying ``useful information'' to Canadiansecurity. Clark did not elaborate.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said earlierin Moscow the Canadian action was ``entirely groundless.''   ``Here we have an apparent provocation planned in advance thathas nothing to do with the activity of Soviet citizens in Canada,''Gerasimov said. ``The provocation of the Canadian authorities willnaturally not remain without due reply.''   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Soviet Deputy ForeignMinister Alexander Bessmertynkh informed Canadian Ambassador VernonTurner of the explusion order against the Canadians.   In a note to Turner, Bessmertynkh called the Canadiangovernment's move ``a rude antagonistic act.'' The note accusedCanada of trying to spoil relations with the Kremlin at a time whenEast-West ties were improving.   However, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Wednesday:``There's just no question about what the Soviets were doing here.''   Clark did not say how long the various diplomats had been undersurveillance or why the government decided to act against them lastweek.   Seven Soviets left Canada last Friday, 48 hours after they wereordered out. They included a consular official in Ottawa, threediplomats from the Soviet consulate in Montreal, a traderepresentative in Montreal and two officials from the Sovietdelegation to the International Civil Aviation Organization.   An eighth diplomat, Capt. Boris Tatarintsev, assistant navalattache at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, was on the expulsion listbut was outside Canada last week. He will not be allowed to return.   The nine Soviets who worked in Canada previously and are nowpersona non grata include two former Soviet Embassy diplomats inOttawa, a journalist based in Ottawa, three members of the Sovietconsulate in Montreal, two civil aviation officials in Montreal anda former manager of the Aeroflot office there.   The Canadian Press news agency, quoting unidentified sources inOttawa, said the Soviet diplomats were believed to have links toboth the KGB, the Soviet secret police, and the GRU, the Sovietmilitary intelligence agency.   Viacheslav Bogdanov, second secretary at the Soviet Embassy,said there would be no comment on the affair.   The Tass dispatch said two Canadian diplomats in Moscow _Raymond Steele, a naval attache, and Evelyn Puxley, a secondsecretary _ had three days to leave the Soviet Union. They wereaccused of ``engaging in activity which is absolutelyunacceptable'' and which did not correspond to their officialstatus _ diplomatic language for spying.   Three Canadians who worked previously at the embassy weredeclared persona non grata and forbidden from returning to theSoviet Union. They were identified as Ann Leahy, a first secretary;John DiGangi, a second secretary; and Kenneth Moody, an air attache.   Mulroney disclosed the action against the Soviets on Tuesday ata news conference concluding the seven-nation economic summit. Heaccused the diplomats of ``improper and unacceptable behavior.''   More than 40 diplomats from the Soviet Union and East Europeancountries have been ordered out of Canada for alleged espionageactivities since 1945.   The last expulsion of Western diplomats from the Soviet Unionwas in April 1987, when the Kremlin ordered out four Frenchdiplomats and two French businessmen. That move was in retaliationfor the earlier expulsion by France of three Soviet diplomatsaccused of spying.</TEXT></DOC>
