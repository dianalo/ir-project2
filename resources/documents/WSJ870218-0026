Mr. Reagan disclosed his plans to a group of U.S. industrialists invited to the White House. He warned that &quot;history has taught us that we cannot become more competitive or enjoy major job growth by restricting imports across-the-board.&quot;    Administration spokesmen said the White House still hasn't completed the schedule for the trips the president will make. But one official said the trips probably will begin in March or April and involve one-day visits to cities around the country. Mr. Reagan did a similar stint in the autumn of 1985 to promote his tax-overhaul proposal.    Mr. Reagan said yesterday he wanted to make the tour &quot;a great national discussion of our future, a kind of great national tent-meeting, what they used to call a Chautauqua.&quot; He said he would be traveling &quot;to schools and factories, to laboratories and work-places all across America.&quot;    The administration's competitiveness package is a potpourri of measures designed to bolster over the long-run the nation's ability to compete in business, by improving educational standards, increasing research and development and easing some restrictions on business. It also contains some modest suggestions for streamlining existing trade law. The administration is proposing it partly to help deflect Congress's attention from more protectionist measures.    At a briefing later for reporters, Treasury Secretary James Baker said the president would be taking two &quot;messages&quot; to the American people during his travels -- first, &quot;that we don't want to march down the road to protectionism,&quot; and second, that his competitiveness package is a better alternative.    The Treasury secretary conceded that &quot;It's no secret that we've changed our strategy&quot; on the trade issue in the wake of last November's Democratic victories in Congress. &quot;Our strategy last year was to fight protectionism with the threat of a veto,&quot; he said. This year, &quot;we plan to cooperate&quot; with Congress in drafting trade legislation.    Mr. Baker also repeated once again that he and other U.S. officials &quot;have not been talking the dollar down&quot; in recent weeks and &quot;have not been for some time.&quot; And he again refused to speculate on what the proper exchange-rate for the dollar ought to be. The U.S. has offered to help its economic allies slow the dollar's slide if West Germany and Japan agree to stimulate demand at home, but the negotiations are still going on.    &quot;We're continuing to work on that problem,&quot; the secretary said. </TEXT></DOC>
