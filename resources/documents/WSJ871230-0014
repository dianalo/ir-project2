The Commerce Department bureau put the overall estimated U.S. population as of July 1 at 243.4 million people, up from nearly 241.1 million in mid-1986 and 226.5 million in the 1980 census.    The latest estimates showed that Florida's population has grown by 2.3 million people, or 23%, since 1980 when it ranked seventh.    Pennsylvania now ranks fifth, followed in order by Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and North Carolina, the Census Bureau said.    Meanwhile, Alaska, the least-populous state at the time of the 1980 census, is now second-smallest with an estimated population of 525,000. Wyoming ranks last with a population of 490,000.    Population losses continued in the past year in five farm states -- Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho.    Energy-depressed states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming, also showed losses, and Texas grew far more slowly than earlier in the decade, the agency said.    The new figures are only estimates. The government will conduct a fullfledged census in 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
