This new facilitywould provide centralized treatment, processing, and storage of LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory's (LLNL's) non-radioactive (both hazardousand nonhazardous), mixed, and radioactive waste, and would also includea decontamination facility. The proposed DWTF, which would replace existingHazardous Waste Management (HWM) facilities, would assure that the longterm management of waste at LLNL is accomplished in a safe, efficient,and environmentally acceptable manner in compliance with federal, state,and local environmental regulations and DOE orders.Public comments are invited and a public hearing will be held with respectto the DEIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments to the Department of Energy should bepostmarked by September 6, 1988 to ensure consideration in the preparationof the final Environmental Impact Statement.

Previous Notice of Intent</ITAG>The Department of Energy published a Notice of Intent (52 FR 8503) on March18, 1987, regarding the preparation of a DEIS on the construction and operationof the DWTF at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background Information</ITAG>The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a diversified applied researchcenter operated by the University of California for DOE. LLNL is involvedin nuclear and non-nuclear weapons design and also non-defense relatedprograms such as magnetic and laser fusion energy research, basic scienceresearch, and biomedical and environmental science studies. LLNL generatesa diversity of non-radioactive, mixed, and radioactive wastes. To handlethis wide variety of generated wastes, flexible treatment processes andknowledgeable personnel are required to assure safe and effective wastemanagement operations that are fully in compliance with applicable federal,state, and local regulations. An extensive upgrade in hazardous waste managementat the Laboratory would result through the construction of the proposedDWTF. The proposed DWTF would replace and consolidate existing storage,treatment, and decontamination facilities presently in use at LLNL. Theexisting facilities are located in three separate areas of the Laboratory.The Decontamination Building, Building 419, is a 40-year-old former paintshop with limited capability to accept large pieces of equipment for decontamination.The Building 514 area contains the existing liquid waste treatment facilitiesconsisting of a 15,000 gallon storage tank, six (6) open-top treatmenttanks, and a vacuum filter press. Radioactive, mixed, and non-radioactivewastes are handled in the facility. The Building 612 area contains theoutside waste storage yard receiving area, solid waste processing building,reactive material storage, and a controlled air incinerator.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Scope of the DEIS</ITAG>The scope of the DEIS was developed using comments received during a publicscoping period (March 18 through May 7, 1987) including the public scopingmeeting held in Livermore, California on April 30, 1987.The U.S. Department of Energy has prepared this project-specific DEIS toprovide environmental input into the selection and implementation of along-term solution for treating, processing, and storing of radioactive,mixed, and non-radioactive wastes generated by LLNL programs that is consistentwith federal, state, and local environmental regulations and DOE orders.The DEIS was prepared in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as amended, and to satisfy therequirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and thestate's permitting regulations. It is intended to provide environmentalinput and support for project-specific decisions on the construction andoperation of the DWTF. DOE has evaluated several alternatives for managingradioactive, mixed, and non-radioactive wastes generated by LLNL programs.The alternatives range in concept from the continued use of existing HWMfacilities to the construction of a new DWTF that could safely treat, process,and store waste generated by LLNL in-house, thereby reducing the risksand liability of transporting large volumes of toxic waste to off-sitetreatment or disposal sites. Various sites for the construction of theproposed DWTF are also evaluated.The following alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS:andbullet; No action, i.e., continued operation of the existing hazardouswaste management facilities;andbullet; Increasing off-site treatment and disposal of waste generatedby LLNL at DOE and commercial facilities;andbullet; Upgrading the existing LLNL hazardous waste management facilities;andandbullet; Developing a new on-site hazardous waste facility for which twodesign alternatives and three site alternatives are evaluated.The environmental effects of the above alternatives are evaluated withrespect to seismicity and to construction and operational impacts on soils,hydrology, air quality, occupational and public health, vegetation andwildlife, socioeconomics, land use, noise, transportation, and culturalresources. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Comment Procedures</ITAG>A. Availability of Draft EISCopies of the DEIS have been distributed to federal, state, and local agencies,organizations, environmental groups, and individuals known to be interestedin the construction of the proposed DWTF at the Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory. Additional copies may be obtained by contacting Mr. WilliamHolman at the address given above.Copies of the DEIS and the documents referenced in the DEIS are availablefor public inspection at the LLNL Visitors Center which is located at theGreenville Road entrance to the Laboratory and at the Freedom of InformationReading Room, Room I E-190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence AvenueSW., Washington, DC.
