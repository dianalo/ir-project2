TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Analysts said Israel may make a limitedmilitary response to Wednesday's suicide bombing by the pro-IranianHezbollah, despite the risk to diplomatic efforts aimed at endingthe hostage crisis.   The government did not mention retaliation in its response tostatements from Beirut saying the suicide car bomb, which woundedfive Israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman, was a response tothe abduction July 28 of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Hezbollahspiritual leader.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir telephoned President Bush as a wayof ``achieving a better coordination between the Israeli and U.S.positions on hostages and prisoners of war,'' said Shamir'sadviser, Avi Pazner.   He described the 10-minute conversation as ``very good andfriendly.'' He said Shamir repeated Israel's position that it willfree Obeid only in exchange for the three Israeli soldiers held inLebanon and ``all the hostages.'' Pazner would not give details ofBush's replies.   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eightAmericans.   An Israeli government statment after the bombing said:   ``To our great sorrow, another brutal attack was committed todayclose to our northern border. This attack, for which Hezbollahassumed responsibility, is another link in a long and bloody chainof attacks along this border which has been going on for many years.   ``This is another horrible reminder of the constant securityproblem along our northern border which unfortunately places Israelon the frontline of the struggle against international terrorism.''   Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, Uri Lubrani, said therewould be retaliation eventually, but he did not say when or whatform it would take.   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all theorganizations which threaten the normal life of the securityzone,'' he said. ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliatein one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.''   Ariel Merari, a terrorism expert at Tel Aviv University's JaffeeCenter for Strategic Studies, said in an interview that Israelwould be viewed as weak unless it retaliated.   ``An Israeli retaliation would disrupt negotiations no more thanthis car bombing. Unless this becomes a trend, a single Israeliretaliation would not change anything,'' he said.   He suggested the military response should be measured so as notto provoke a cycle of attack and counterattack.   ``I would recommend some type of strike or force in retaliationfor this,'' he said. ``The only way to bring Hezbollah to a(hostage) deal is to project force against force.''   Speaking on Israeli TV, military commentator Ron Ben-Ishai saidin the past Israel had used air raids to respond to such attackseven when Israeli prisoners were threatened.   ``When we had a car bomb attack last year, Hezbollah threatenedthat if Israel reacted, it would harm Israeli prisoners of war. Thearmy then made its calculations and the air force bombed Hezbollahcommand headquarters,'' he said.   The suicide car bomb in October 1988 claimed the lives of eightIsraeli soldiers and wounded seven others. Israel responded withthree air raids and a ground assault in which 16 Lebanese werekilled and 40 wounded.   Ben-Ishai also said Israel risked being viewed as weak if it didnot retaliate.   Aharon Levran, a retired brigadier general and a commentator onmilitary affairs, said Israel response would be ``moderate'' if amilitary option was chosen to punish Hezbollah.   But he suggested Israel might refrain from any military activityso as ``not to agitate world public opinion'' after the U.S.criticism over Israel's abduction of Obeid.   ``I would not be surprised if Israel will swallow hard and donothing. Israel does not want to disrupt the process (ofnegotiations) which has begun with Sheik Obeid,'' he said in aninterview.   ``If Israel is going to punish Hezbollah by launching reprisalsit will be shooting itself in the foot. It will not facilitate theexchange of prisoners,'' he added.   Israel abducted the Shiite clergyman to try to prod Hezbollahinto agreeing to a prisoner exchange. Shiite radicals aligned withthe group are believed to be holding three Israeli servicemencaptured in 1986.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to exchange Obeid andseveral hundred other Shiite prisoners held in Israeli jails forthe Israeli airman and two soldiers. But Rabin stressed Tuesdaythat Israel would not start negotiations until they had some signof life from the POWs.</TEXT></DOC>
