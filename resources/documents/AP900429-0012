But the No. 2-ranking defense official said a hot-line betweensenior military commanders of India and Pakistan remains open andthe tense situation between the uneasy neighbors ``is graduallymoving toward normalcy.''   The remarks by a foreign ministry spokesman and the deputydefense minister Col. Ghulam Sarwar Cheema were in response toIndia's latest charges Pakistan is arming and training Moslemseparatists in Indian-controlled Kashmir.   ``No amount of sophistry can hide the fact that the insurrectionthere is totally indigenous,'' the foreign ministry spokesman said.``The root of the insurrection is the continued denial of the rightof self-determination of the people in Indian-occupied Kashmir.''   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,said Pakistan was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ``falseallegations and untenable assertions'' made Saturday by the Indiangovernment.   New Delhi warned Pakistan it would not tolerate infringement ofits sovereignty in Kashmir, and a government spokesman refused torule out cross-border raids to eliminate suspected guerrilla camps.   ``There will be no compromise on the measures necessary toprotect our integrity,'' the Indian government said in a statement.   The foreign ministry spokesman said Pakistan regrets India ``haspersisted in its belicose statements after the foreign minister ofIndia in New York three days ago agreed with his Pakistancounterpart to exercise restraint.''   More than 300 people have been killed in Indian-held Kashmirsince Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched their latest and harshestcrackdown on Moslem separatists. Most were Moslem militants orsupporters shot by Indian troops during anti-India demonstrationsor while defying curfews.   India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming, training andfinancing the Kashmiri militants who want to secede from mostlyHindu India and become an independent nation with neutral status.Islamabad routinely denies the allegations, but says it supportsthe Kashmiris right to self-determination.   ``Instead of whipping up a war psychosis and indulging insabre-rattling, we hope India will align its position to theposition of the international community, which stands for thepeaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute,'' the foreign ministryspokesman said.   As violence by Moslem militants escalated, both countriesreinforced their troops along the border and the contested Kashmirfrontier. Each side has repeatedly said it does not want war buthas accused the other of fomenting a climate that could lead toarmed confrontation.   New Delhi has repeatedly denied allegations of abuse and tortureby Indian troops in Kashmir.   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which isdivided by a cease-fire line monitored by the united nations.   Kashmir was a princely state when India and Pakistan werepartitioned along religious lines into separate nations. Most ofKashmir's residents were Moslems, but the ruler was a Hindu whoopted for union with India.   Pakistan moved into the northern third of Kashmir. The rest cameunder Indian control as part of the state of Jammu-Kashmir, theonly Moslem state in India.   ``Pakistan does not want another war and no saner elements _either in India or Pakistan _ will support war,'' Cheema toldreporters in Rawalpindi.   ``The hot-line is still open between the senior militarycommanders of the two countries and Pakistan is taking all steps toreduce tension.''</TEXT></DOC>
