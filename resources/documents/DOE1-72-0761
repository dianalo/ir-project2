These fuels include wastes from processing wood intolumber, plywood, and pulp; manure from cattle, poultry, and hogs; cropwastes such as rice straw; and wastes from food processing operationssuch as the refining of cane sugar, the manufacture of instant coffee,and the canning of fruits and vegetables. Biomass fuels also includecrops raised specifically for energy such as fast-growing trees, sugarcrops (e.g. sorghum), and other plants. Almost all of the biomass usedfor energy today is combusted directly. Biomass combustion is being usedfor electricity generation, process heat raising, and cogeneration.</TEXT></DOC>
