No. 188,480, filed Apr. 29, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,924,498 which is      hereby incorporated in its entirety by this reference thereto. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to an improved scrambling apparatus or      encoder for self calibrating a selectively scrambled or encoded video      signal. Currently, several techniques are known for scrambling a video      signal. These techniques include, but are not limited to, selective      inversion of at least a portion of the video signal, selective      synchronization (sync) suppression and/or generation of split sync pulses.      Typically, the sync pulse comprises a single pulse between the front and      back porch characterized by a single voltage level for substantially the      entire sync interval. A split sync pulse generally refers to a sync      interval comprising two or more pulses, i.e., two or more voltage levels      between the front and back porch. The desirability of providing split sync      pulses and the advantages derived therefrom are fully described in the      above referenced copending application. For purposes of illustration, an      example of a video signal having a split sync pulse is shown in FIG. 1. It      is to be understood that many other embodiments of a split sync signal      will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, the horizontal sync interval of the video signal      comprises two signal portions. The first portion is preferably a pulse      having a level at substantially -40 IRE corresponding to the sync tip      level. The second portion of the sync interval preferably comprises a      pulse having a level of substantially andplus;100 IRE corresponding to the peak      white level of the signal. Many other formats for split sync pulses are      described in the referenced copending application and it is to be      understood that split sync pulses may be used with selectively inverted      video or non-inverted video signals and the split sync pulses may      themselves be selectively inverted or non-inverted. </PAR><PAR>  As more fully described in the referenced application, a signal transmitted      with such a split sync signal has many advantages. For example, if it is      desired to scramble the signal by inverting the video portion of the      signal, the signal must be reinverted at the receiver and significantly,      this inversion and reinversion must occur around the same axis of      inversion in both the transmitter (scrambler) and receiver (descrambler).      If it is desired to establish an axis of inversion substantially midway      between the peak white level (e.g., andplus;100 IRE) and the sync tip level      (e.g., -40 IRE), it will be apparent that the axis of inversion should be      andplus;30 IRE. This axis of inversion can be calculated in the receiver by      averaging the peak level and sync tip level. One way of selectively      inverting signals or portions thereof is to produce substantially parallel      signal paths in a scrambler comprising, e.g., a non-inverted signal path      and an inverted signal path. Since there will be different components in      the different signal paths which may introduce an offset of the signal in      one path with respect to the signal in another path, it is important to      ensure that the selected pulse levels of both the inverted and      non-inverted signals produced in the scrambler are accurately calibrated,      i.e., at least a portion of one of the signals substantially corresponds      to at least a portion of another of the signals. Plural paths may be used      in other scrambling applications as well. For example, they may be used to      provide various levels of sync suppression. </PAR><PAR>  In the past, scramblers were manufactured and subsequently calibrated in      the factory using external calibration instruments known to those of      ordinary skill in the art. This calibration was necessary to ensure that      corresponding portions of the signals in each of the signal paths occurred      at desired levels, e.g., in the case of split sync pulses it may be      desired to have the low sync tip and high sync tip levels correspond to      -40 IRE and andplus;100 IRE levels respectively. This calibration step adds      additional expense and time to the manufacture of scramblers which is      obviously undesirable. To carry out this external calibration, the video      signal in a non-inverted signal path might be sampled and compared to a      video signal from an inverted path and any difference between a      predetermined portion of the signals would be corrected. </PAR><PAR>  As will be explained more fully below, the present invention relies on      self-calibration. Self-calibration is distinguished from external      calibration in that self-calibration is performed by circuitry within the      scrambler itself and automatically adjusts at least a portion of one      signal to correspond to a portion of another signal without the use of      external calibration equipment. </PAR><PAR>  As described in the cross-referenced application, video signals comprising      a split sync pulse may be generated by using internally generated voltage      levels that are multiplexed with a standard video signal to replace the      normally occurring sync signal with an internally generated split sync      signal. According to a preferred embodiment of the copending application,      the split sync signal may comprise a pulse corresponding to the sync tip      level (-40 IRE). It is also disclosed that it is desirable to perform the      functions of D. C. clamping and automatic gain control (AGC). It is      preferred tha the sync tip level be clamped to the -40 IRE voltage level      and then the gain be adjusted so that the back porch level corresponds to      the O IRE level. If clamping and gain control do not occur prior to      insertion of internally generated split sync pulses, errors can occur if,      e.g. the clamped sync tip level is not substantially the same as the      internally generated low sync tip level portion of the sync pulse. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In order to overcome these and other drawbacks of prior art scramblers, it      is an object of the present invention to provide a self-calibrating      scrambler which avoids the need for factory calibration. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of this invention to provide encoded and non-encoded      signals along plural paths, selectively output one of the signals and      self-calibrate the signals along the plural paths. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, it is an object of this invention to obviate the need      for factory calibration of scramblers that are used for producing video      signals with split sync pulses. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved scrambler      for use in producing video signals with split sync pulses that may be      scrambled by a variety of known scrambling techniques. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a more efficient      scrambler. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a scrambler that may be      produced more economically. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to minimize signal errors in a      scrambler capable of generating split sync pulses. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to minimize discrepancy between      clamped signal levels of signal portions and corresponding internally      generated signal portions that are inserted into a scrambled video signal. </PAR><PAR>  Generally speaking, one aspect of the present invention relates to self      calibrating a scrambler wherein, e.g., plural signal paths are used to      generate various types of signals. For example, if selective inversion of      a part of a video signal is desired, there may be a non-inverted signal      path and an inverted signal path. The self calibration referred to is the      process whereby at least a portion of a signal from one of the plural      paths is made to correspond with a corresponding portion of a signal from      another of the plural paths. For example, the sync tip level of a first      signal on a first path may be made equal to the sync tip level of a second      signal on a second path. Additionally, the gain of a first signal may be      made equal to the gain of a second signal to self-calibrate the signals. </PAR><PAR>  This self calibration may be implemented in a number of ways which may      include comparing corresponding signal portions and using a feedback      signal to make one signal correspond to the other signal, clamping a      portion of a signal to a corresponding portion of another signal, clamping      signals from two separate paths to the same reference level and other      techniques that will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the      art. </PAR><PAR>  According to another feature of the invention, an incoming video signal may      be clamped and gain controlled based on internally generated levels, which      levels are also used to generate scrambled video signals including split      sync signals. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a video signal having a split      sync signal. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 3 are a block diagram of a scrambler according to a preferred      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 are block diagrams of the High and Low sync comparators of      the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 8c are a schematic representation of the      scrambler according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a timing diagram illustrating various timing signals that control      portions of the circuits of FIGS. 6-8. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a diagrammatic representation of a noninverted and inverted      video signal including split sync pulses. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 11 and 12 are block diagrams illustrating alternative ways of      self-calibrating signals on plural signal paths according to the teachings      of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is an alternative voltage divider circuit. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14 and 15 show alternative self-calibration circuitry. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments that      will be described below. Rather, one aspect of the invention is broadly      defined as self-calibrating signals on plural signals paths of a      scrambler. This technique may be implemented in a number of ways and may      be used with various types of scrambling (encoding) techniques. For      example, the plural signal paths could generate inverted/non-inverted      signals; suppressed/non-suppressed signals or various levels of      suppression; or broadly speaking encoded/non-encoded signals. </PAR><PAR>  For the sake of clarity, all of these permutations will not be discussed      herein. However, the preferred embodiment of using selective      inversion/non-inversion of a signal having split sync pulses will be      discussed. It will be readily apparent to one or ordinary skill in the      art, from a description of the preferred embodiment, how to implement the      various other permutations of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a scrambler according to the present      invention. The encircled numbers in FIG. 2 indicate various nodes of the      circuit to aid the reader in understanding this embodiment. At node 1, a      standard NTSC video signal is input to a scrambler. This signal may be      passed through the appropriate signal conditioning circuits and is applied      at node 2 to an input of an operational amplifier 21. A portion of the      output of operational amplifier is provided along a feedback path 22 and      is fed back to an input of the operational amplifier 21. The output of the      operational amplifier is indicated by node 3. Another portion of the      output of operational amplifier 21 is provided along feedback path 23 to a      DC clamp circuit 24. This DC clamp circuit locks the sync tip level to 0      volts. The DC clamp circuit 24 also receives as inputs, a 0 volt signal      and a control signal designated as &quot;A-40&quot; which corresponds to a clamp      enable signal. The output of the DC clamp is provided along path 25 to an      input of operational amplifier 21. Another portion of the output of      operational amplifier 21 is provided along feedback path 26 to AGC circuit      27. This AGC circuit performs automatic gain control and provides an      output signal to light dependent resistor 28 which is connected between      node 2 and ground. The AGC circuit 27 receives an input indicated by BURST      WINDOW and an input from node 6 which corresponds to the 0 IRE level of      the video signal. The AGC circuit locks the portions of the video signal      (at node 3) that are to occur at the 0 IRE level to the voltage at node 6.      Node 3 is connected to node 4 through a resistor. Node 4 is connected to a      peak clip circuit 29 which performs the function of clipping the video      signals or portions thereof that exceed a predetermined reference level.      Typically, this reference level may correspond to the 100 IRE level. An      input to the peak clip circuit is a voltage tapped from node 5      corresponding to the 100 IRE level of the video signal. The output of node      4 which is a conditioned video signal in NTSC format, is applied as one      input to multiplexer 30. Another input to multiplexer 30 is a signal      corresonding to the 100 IRE level. Additionally, the multiplexer 30      receives inputs corresponding to a 0 IRE level and a -40 IRE level. The      100 IRE and 0 IRE levels may be generated by a voltage divider network      consisting of a voltage source connected to node 5 via a resistor, a      second resistor connected between node 5 and node 6, and a third resistor      connected between node 6 and ground. (If additional voltage levels are      desired, a voltage divider such as the one shown in FIG. 13 may be used to      generate any number of voltages at any voltage levels.) The -40 IRE level      is preferably a signal corresponding to ground. Multiplexer 30 also      receives inputs corresponding to SYNC A and SYNC B timing signals which      will be described more fully below. Based on these inputs, there may be      produced at node 7 a video signal with split sync pulses similar to the      signal shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  A more detailed description of how this video signal with split sync pulses      is produced is provided in the cross-reference application. However, a      brief description will be provided here for clarity. In essence, the      output 7 is normally connected to the video signal input. However, during      the horizontal blanking interval, e.g., multiplexer 30 connects the output      node 7 to either the 100 IRE, 0 IRE or -40 IRE inputs. For example, the      output node 7 may be connected through multiplexer 30 to the video input      during the portion corresponding to the video interval of the signal.      During a blanking interval or reference level, the output may be connected      to the 0 IRE level input signal. This may correspond to the breeze-way or      front porch interval of the video signal. To generate the synchronization      interval, the output 7 may first be connected to the -40 IRE input signal      for a period of time corresponding to one-half of the synchronization      interval period and for the second half of the synchronization interval      period, the output 7 may be connected to the 100 IRE input signal. At the      end of the synchronization interval the output node 7 may then again be      connected to the 0 IRE input for the back porch interval and then again to      the video signal input. By repeating this pattern, video signals with      split sync pulses can be internally generated. </PAR><PAR>  The output of multiplexer 30 indicated by node 7 is then applied to the      input of emitter follower buffer 31. The output of emitter follower buffer      31 as indicated at node 8 is provided along two signal paths to generate      an inverted and a non-inverted video signal. One portion of the output is      provided to the positive input of a non-inverting unity gain operational      amplifier 32 to generate the non-inverted video signal. The output of this      non-inverting amplifier 32 is indicated as node 11. The other portion of      the output of emitter follower buffer 31 is provided through a resistor to      the negative input of inverting amplifier 33 to generate the inverted      video signal. The output of amplifier 33 indicated as node 12 is fed back      to a feedback path comprising a resistor connected in parallel to a light      dependent resistor indicated by LDR3. For the reasons noted above, it is      important that, e.g., the sync levels of the inverted and non-inverted      video signals be substantially identical. Therefore, the positive input of      amplifier 33 is provided as a feedback signal from node 10 corresponding      to the output of a low sync compare circuit 34 which will be described      more fully below. A portion of the output of amplifier 33 is also provided      as an input to each of a low sync compare circuit 34 and a high sync      compare circuit 35. Each of the low sync compare circuit and high sync      compare circuit 34 and 35 respectively, also receives an input from node      11 corresponding to the output of amplifier 32. The output of high sync      compare circuit 35, indicated by node 9, is provided as an input to the      light dependent resistor indicated by LDR3. As will be explained more      fully below, this arrangement causes the sync tip levels of the inverted      video signal to track the sync tip levels of the non-inverted video      signals. </PAR><PAR>  The non-inverted video signal from the output of node 11 is provided as an      input to mode select switch 36. Another input to mode select switch 36 is      the inverted video signal provided from node 12 corresponding to an output      of amplifier 33. Mode select switch 36 also receives a signal indicated as      &quot;INVERT&quot; which is used to select an inverted or non-inverted mode of      operation to thereby provide an output signal at node 13 corresponding to      a video signal having split sync pulses wherein portions of the video      signal may be selectively inverted or non-inverted according to a desired      operation. A description of the INVERT signal will be provided below. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIG. 3, it can be seen that the output of mode select      switch 36 indicated by node 13 is provided as an input to emitter follower      buffer 37. The output of buffer 37 indicated by node 14 is provided along      two signal paths. A portion of the output of buffer 37 is provided along a      path comprising voltage divider network 38. The output of the voltage      divider network 38 is provided as an input to switch 40. Another portion      of the output of amplifier 37 is provided to a SIN.sup.2 filter 39 and      other circuit components including resistors as shown. The output of      filter 39 is provided as another input to switch 40. Additionally, switch      40 receives a timing signal indicated by &quot;/AREL,&quot; which corresponds to a      ring eliminating timing signal. The output of switch 40 is AC coupled      through capacitor 41 to an output buffer 42 and is provided as a video      output signal. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the low sync compare circuit 34 and high      sync compare circuit 35 of FIG. 2 will now be described. FIG. 4      illustrates a preferred embodiment of a high sync compare circuit      comprising a gated integrator. As shown, the high sync compare circuit has      two inputs, an inverted input and a non-inverted input from nodes 12 and      11, respectively. The non-inverted input corresponds to the output of      amplifier 32 of FIG. 2. The inverted input corresponds to the output of      amplifier 33 shown in FIG. 2. Each of these inputs is connected through a      switch and resistor to an input terminal of operational amplifier 43. The      inverted input is applied through a switch which is controlled according      to a timing signal corresponding to &quot;/A-40&quot; while the non-inverted input      is applied through a switch controlled by a timing signal corresponding to      &quot;/A100.&quot; </PAR><PAR>  This circuit samples both the reference and the signal to be locked. The      difference between them is integrated during the gate window. </PAR><PAR>  Attention is now directed to FIG. 5 and the following description of the      low sync compare circuit 34 of FIG. 2. The low sync compare circuit has      two inputs, a non-inverted input and an inverted input. The non-inverted      input corresponds to the output of amplifier 32 of FIG. 2 while the      inverted input corresponds to an output of amplifier 33 of FIG. 2. Each of      these inputs is connected through a switch and resistor to an input      terminal of amplifier 44. The switch through which the non-inverted input      is connected to amplifier 44 is controlled by a timing signal      corresponding to &quot;/A-40.&quot; The switch through which the inverted input is      connected to amplifier 44 is controlled based on a timing signal      corresponding to &quot;/A100.&quot; Amplifiers 43 and 44 are configured in a known      manner as comparators to compare the sync levels of the inverted and      non-inverted sync signals. Since the output of these comparators are      connected to the feedback paths of amplifier 33 as described above, the      inverted video signal with split sync pulses is made to track the      non-inverted video signal with split sync pulses thereby self calibrating      the system. This circuit operates in a similar manner as that of the high      sync compare circuit. Alternatives to the gated integrator approach are      disclosed in FIGS. 14 and 15 and the description thereof. </PAR><PAR>  What has been described above is a block diagram illustrating the major      components of the present invention presented in a simplified manner to      enhance the clarity of the description of the novel features of the      present invention. Schematic diagrams of a preferred implementation of the      present invention are provided in FIGS. 6, 7 and 8. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 6, op amp U1 corresponds to op amp 21 of FIG. 2. DC CLAMP LOOP      corresponds to D.C. Clamp 24 and AGC LOOP corresponds to AGC circuit 27.      The /ABUR signal corresponds to &quot;BURST WINDOW.&quot; Q3 and Q4 comprise the      PEAK CLIP circuit 29. U6 corresponds to multiplexer 30. Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4,      5, 6 and 7 of FIG. 6 correspond to the respective nodes of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 7, Q5 and the associated circuitry corresponds to buffer amp 31 of      FIG. 2. U7 and U8 correspond to non-inverting amplifier 32 and inverting      amplifier 33, respectively. U9 and U10 correspond to the HIGH SYNC COMPARE      circuit 35 and LOW SYNC COMPARE circuit, respectively. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11      and 12 of FIG. 7 correspond to the respective nodes of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 8, Q9 and Q8 correspond to node select switch 36. /AINV corresponds      to the INVERT signal applied to switch 36. Q10 corresponds to buffer 37.      R38 and R37 comprise resistor network 38 of FIG. 3. L1-L3 and C35-C40      comprise SIN.sup.2 filter 39. Q11 and Q12 comprise switch 40 of FIG. 3.      U12 corresponds to amplifier 42. Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 correspond to      the respective nodes of FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  The operation of the schematically illustrated circuitry will be readily      apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the discussion of      the block diagram of FIGS. 2-5 presented above. However, the High and Low      sync compare circuits will be further described. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10, represents a non inverted video signal as would be found on pin 11      of U7, labeled NONINVERTED VIDEO, in FIG. 7. This signal has already had      the split sync signal added in switch U6 (FIG. 6). However, the selective      video inversion has not yet been accomplished. Indeed it is the function      of the High and Low sync compare circuits to condition the video signal so      selective portions of it can be inverted. One object of the circuitry of      FIG. 7 is to generate both non inverted and inverted video (present on pin      11 of U7 and U8 respectively) having substantially identical amplitudes      and offsets, though of opposite polarity. Inversion is then accomplished      by switching between the two video signals at the appropriate times. The      switching is accomplished in transistors Q9 and Q8 (FIG. 8). Timing of the      switching action is governed by some of the waveforms on the timing      diagram, which will be explained below. The object of the High and Low      sync compare sample and hold circuits (FIG. 2), is to ensure that the      video appearing on the two amplifier outputs are indeed identical in gain      and offset, though of opposite polarity. The LOW sync comparator governs      the operation of the DC matching. FIG. 10 helps clarify the operation of      this loop. The LOW comparator seeks to maintain the -40 IRE level of the      two video signals at the same D.C. reference, regardless of offsets in the      two video operational amplifiers, U7 and U8. This is accomplished by      sampling the -40 IRE level of the two signals, and applying a correction,      if required, to one input of amplifier U8. This correction is supplied to      pin 6 of U8 through resistor R84. As shown in FIG. 10, the &quot;-40 IRE REF&quot;      signal controls operation of two sampling gates, though we only address      one of them now. This &quot;A-40 IRE REF&quot; signal is so annotated on the timing      diagram of FIG. 9, and is referred to on the schematic by its circuit      designation /A-40. With reference again to FIG. 7, the -40 IRE REF (a.k.a.      &quot;/A-40&quot;) is supplied to switch U11 pin 9, which is closed while the non      inverted sync is at the -40 IRE level. This -40 IRE level is stored on      capacitor C67. During the last half of the split sync, signal &quot;100 IRE      REF&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;/A100&quot;) is active. It causes switch U11 pin 16 to close.      This connects a -40 IRE level signal from the inverted video, to capacitor      C70, which stores that voltage level. Operational amplifier U10 compares      the voltage stored on C67, representing -40 IRE of the non inverted video,      with that stored on C70, representing -40 IRE of the inverted video.      Ideally the two voltages are equal. If not the output from U10 changes.      This changes the voltage on pin 6 of inverting operational amplifier U8,      in turn changing the output voltage (during the -40 IRE portion of split      sync) until it is the same as the -40 IRE voltage of the non inverted      video. </PAR><PAR>  In a like manner, the andplus;100 IRE levels of the non inverted and inverted      video are sampled respectively by U11 pin 1 and U11 pin 8. Timing of the      two samples is controlled again by the -40 IRE REF and 100 IRE REF logic      levels, operating on the video at the proper times to recover the andplus;100 IRE      level. The two voltages representing the andplus;100 IRE portion of the two video      signals, are stored on capacitors C29 and C30 and compared in comparator      U9. The output from U9 controls a light dependent resistor, LDR3, which      controls the gain of the inverting video amplifier, U8. </PAR><PAR>  To summarize, the amplitude and gain of the inverted and non-inverted video      signals are made equal by first adjusting the offset (DC) voltage of one      signal until the two match at the lowest voltage level. Then the gain of      one signal is adjusted until the two signals are of equal magnitude,      determined by measuring their respective peak amplitudes. After it has      been assured that the two signals are of identical DC level and gain, they      are considered self-calibrated and the self calibrated selectively      inverted signal can be composed by switching between these two signals. </PAR><PAR>  It will be readily apparent that the &quot;LOW&quot; circuit operates faster than the      &quot;HIGH&quot; circuit, based on the value of the holding capacitors in the two      circuits. In the &quot;LOW&quot; circuit, the value of holding capacitors C67 and      C70 is 0.01 uF. The value of the holding capacitors in the &quot;HIGH&quot; circuit,      C29 and C30, are 0.47 uF, i.e., 47 times larger. Since all four capacitors      are charged through like resistances (R 29, 30, 32, 60), the smaller      capacitors will charge faster, resulting in faster operation of the &quot;LOW&quot;      sampling circuit. For loop stability reasons a significantly faster &quot;LOW&quot;      loop than &quot;HIGH&quot; loop is desired.Since the &quot;HIGH&quot; value of the video      signal is affected by the &quot;LOW&quot; amplitude, if the two loops operated at      about the same speed, the &quot;HIGH&quot; loop could wind up &quot;chasing&quot; the &quot;LOW&quot;      loop, resulting in an unstable circuit. </PAR><PAR>  The &quot;LOW&quot; circuit acts as a DC level adjust by changing the voltage on pin      6 of U8, in response to the difference between the -40 IRE level voltages      of the two video signals. The voltage output of this amplifier can be      shown to be equal to:      ##EQU1##      where .sup.R Fandequals;R.sub.55 in parallel with R54andplus;LDR3. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, by adjusting the input voltage on pin 6 of U8, its output voltage is      correspondingly adjusted. Similarly, the gain is adjusted by changing the      value of light dependent resistor LDR3. This can also be seen from the      equation. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a timing diagram which shows relative timing between various      signals shown in the schematic and block diagrams. The upper portion of      FIG. 9 depicts a portion of a video signal having a split sync pulse.      Above the video signal, there are various symbols which are defined as      follows. </PAR><PAR>  1. ENWS--ENable Window Start: At this time the video being processed      through the scrambler is switched to go through the ring eliminator      SIN.sup.2 filter to eliminate Gibbs ringing caused by sharp transitions of      video inversion processing. </PAR><PAR>  2. INVS--INverting Window Start: At this time the video being processed by      the scrambler is brought to 0 IRE to prepare it for processing. Failure to      do so will under certain conditions result in an improperly descrambled      video signal. Also, at this time the video inversion starts if the sync      invert mode is selected. If video invert is selected, this is the time at      which the inversion stops. For both of the above cases, this condition      will continue until INVE. If either sync suppression or invert all modes      is selected, nothing happens at this time. </PAR><PAR>  3. SYWS--SYnc Window Start: This is the time at which the sync pulse starts      on the incoming video. It is also the time that the reconstructed sync      starts (reconstructed sync is used to generate the split sync signal). </PAR><PAR>  4. 300N (first occurrence)--300 nanoseconds: This is the time required for      the sync to transition from 0 IRE to -40 IRE. It is determined by the ring      eliminator filter of FIG. 8. This filter is added to restrict the      frequencies involved in the split sync pulse otherwise the phenomenon of      &quot;Gibbs ringing&quot; may occur. Sampling of the -40 IRE pulse is delayed to      make it insensitive to any transients which may exist on the edge of the      sync pulse at the sampling point. </PAR><PAR>  5. SPLT--SPLiT. This defines the beginning of the split sync pulse, which      is generated by controlling switch IC U6 (top right of FIG. 6). </PAR><PAR>  6. 300N (second occurrence)--300 nanoseconds: </PAR><PAR>  This is the time required to allow the split sync to reach 100 IRE. It is      controlled as above. Sampling of the 100 IRE level is delayed with the      &quot;100 IRE&quot; signal supra, again to eliminate any sampling errors caused by      ringing in the internal circuits. </PAR><PAR>  7. SYWE--SYnc Window End: This is the time at which the split sync signal      is ended, and sampling the 100 IRE level is ended. </PAR><PAR>  8. 300N (third occurrence)--300 nanoseconds (again): This is the time      required for the sync signal to reach 0 IRE. Nothing is done at this time. </PAR><PAR>  9. BURS--BURSt: At this time the circuit is preparing to transmit the      incoming color burst to the output. During most of the horizontal blanking      interval we are reconstructing the video waveform, but it is desirable to      pass the incoming burst to the output unaffected. So the output, which has      been switched to internally generated signals since time ENWS, is switched      back to the input. (The output video is connected to internally generated      signals whenever either SYNCA or SYNCB is high--see the right side of the      timing diagram.) Also, the ring element invert is switched off during this      time. </PAR><PAR>  10. CBUR--Color BURst: This designates the time for the color burst on the      incoming signal. Nothing is done during this time. </PAR><PAR>  11. BURE--BURst End: At this time, the video is switched back to internally      generated signals in preparation for ending the blanking mode and      returning to the active video mode. </PAR><PAR>  12. INVE--INVert End: At this time, the output is switched back to the      input video, and depending on the scrambling mode, inversion is either      begun or ended at this time. </PAR><PAR>  13. ENWE--ENable Window End: At this time, the ring eliminator filter is      switched off and the active line begins. </PAR><PAR>  The timing signals of FIG. 9 are described as follows. </PAR><PAR>  1. SUPPRESSION WINDOW: Controls operation of the switched sync suppression      part of the scrambler. </PAR><PAR>  2. INVERSION WINDOW: Controls inversion of all or part of the video (active      or blanking), depending on the mode of scrambling. This signal appears on      FIG. 8 as /AINV, (bottom left). It controls the two transistors switches      Q8 and Q9, which select inverted or non inverted video. </PAR><PAR>  3. SYNCB: When high, switch U6 connects the outgoing video to signals      generated internally in the scrambler. When low, the incoming video is      passed to the output (unless overridden by SYNCA). This signal appears on      FIG. 6 (top right). </PAR><PAR>  4. SYNCA: High during the sync tip. This signal appears at the top right of      FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  5. SPLIT: This signal is part of the logic that makes up SYNC B (FIG. 6,      top right). SPLIT controls selection of the 100 IRE level or -40 IRE      (ground), selected in U6 </PAR><PAR>  6. BURST WINDOW: This signal is used as a sample window for the AGC Loop      which comes before the video inversion circuitry. The signal is also      involved in calculating /AREL and SYNC (FIG. 8, lower left), in order to      transmit the incoming color burst to the output. This signal appears in      the middle of FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  7. -40 IRE REF(/A-40): Described above for video inversion, this signal is      also used as a sample window for the DC clamp loop. It is found in the      middle of FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  8. 100 IRE REF. Described above. </PAR><PAR>  9. Ring eliminator: Switches in the ring eliminator filter (FIG. 8) when we      generate a transition, for which Gibbs ringing must be suppressed. This is      shown at /AREL, in the lower left of FIG. 8. </PAR><PAR>  10. ENABLE WINDOW: Defines the times when we substitute internally      generated signals for the incoming video (except for the burst time). This      signal is part of the make-up of SYNCB. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 11 and 12 show block diagrams of circuits capable of use in the      present invention to self calibrate output signals of plural signal paths.      In FIGS. 11 and 12, there is shown at least two signal paths. One path      represents an encoded signal path and another path represents a      non-encoded path. The nonencoded path contains &quot;non-encoding circuitry&quot;      which may comprise for example a unity gain amplifier. The encoded path      contains &quot;encoding circuitry&quot; which may comprise circuitry for modifying      at least a portion of a signal to thereby effect at least one type of      scrambling of the signal provided to the encoded path. Portions of the      outputs of the non-encoding and encoding circuitry may be provided to self      calibration circuitry to self calibrate the signals. </PAR><PAR>  The encoding may comprise one or more of a number of known encoding      techniques including, but not limited to, video inversion, sync inversion,      sync suppression including one or more levels of suppression or other      encoding techniques that will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill      in the art. </PAR><PAR>  For example, the self calibration circuitry may comprise gated integrators,      gated sample and hold devices and/or peak detectors to compare      corresponding portions of signals in the plural paths. Outputs of the      self-calibration circuitry may be fed back to either or both of the      encoding/non-encoding circuitry to self calibrate the signals. Outputs of      the encoding/non-encoding circuitry are also provided to a mode select      switch to manually or automatically select a desired mode, e.g.,      non-encoded video out or encoded video out. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 12, there is shown an example of self calibration circuitry that      may be used in accordance with the present invention. There is shown      plural signal paths and appropriate circuitry for each path. Here the self      calibration circuitry is shown in the form of clamping and gain control      circuitry for clamping a portion of one signal to a value corresponding to      a portion of another signal. Alternatively, or in addition to clamping, a      gain control operation may be performed to make the gain of a portion of      one signal correspond to the gain of a portion of another signal. </PAR><PAR>  For any of the embodiments described herein, it may be desirable to use      other internally generated levels. This may be accomplished according to      the voltage divider of FIG. 13 which shows levels may be generated above,      below, or between 100 IRE and 0 IRE. In this Figure, X, Y and Z are      variables such that (100andplus;X), (100-Y) and (-40andplus;Z) are desired voltage      levels. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 shows a gated sample and hold device which drives an integrator. In      this case, the integrator would be operable substantially all of the time,      not just during the sample window. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 shows a peak detector to perform the self-calibration. In this      embodiment, no gate signal is required but the circuit operates when the      &quot;periodic voltages&quot; are at the extremes (e.g., sync tip levels). </PAR><PAR>  Shown in FIG. 15 is a positive peak detector. For a negative peak detector,      the diode is reversed. </PAR><PAR>  What has been described is the preferred embodiments of the present      invention. Other embodiments will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in      the art. For example, even through the preferred embodiment utilizes      parallel paths for the encoded/non encoded signals, the present invention      could be applied to serial path systems.
