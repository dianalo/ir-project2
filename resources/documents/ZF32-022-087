(Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet)(includesrelated article on rating bank interest rates) (Tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Delonas, Nicholas.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet model is developed to rate investmentpotentials using the net present value (NPV) method, which is moreaccurate than the popular internal rate of return (IRR) method.andO;(at)IRR and (at)NPV both require investments of similar risk to becompared for reliable results.andP;  IRR measures in percent, while NPVadds up dollar values that have been converted into present-valuequantities while discounting future values by the rate of returnon a similar investment.andP;  Many companies establish such a discountrate, calling it the hurdle rate, or cost of capital.andP;  If thepresent-value (PV) dollar result is greater than 0, the investmentis sound.andP;  The PV of a future value FV for a given i=discount rateper period can be calculated using FV/(1 + i)(power of n), wheren=number of intervening compounding periods.andP;  (at)NPV, like(at)IRR, assumes a series of periodic cash flows and that all cashflows are included, but unlike (at)IRR the NPV method does notrequire cash flow at time 0 to be included.andP;  A specific exampleinvolving a condominium investment is detailed to illustrate thedifferences between IRR and NPV.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 (Spreadsheet software) (Usage).andO;Topic:     SpreadsheetsFinancial AnalysisCapital InvestmentForecastingTutorialReturn on InvestmentInvestments.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
