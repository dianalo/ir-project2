But 88-year-old Fidel Velazquez, head of the Mexican LaborFederation, also said last week's crackdown on leaders of thepowerful Oil Workers Union on weapons charges was without precedentin Mexico's labor history.   Velazquez told a news conference: ``The effect what has happenedin the oil union could have on public opinion is worrisome. It ishoped that all will turn out well for the country and the oilworker's union.''   He did not elaborate, but the oil workers and others haveexpressed concern over the violence used in arresting JoaquinHernandez Galicia, the longtime de facto chief of the oil workers,though he held only a minor office.   Soldiers fired a bazooka to blast down the door of HernandezGalicia's home in the northeastern city of Ciudad Madero on Jan. 10and with agents of the Attorney General's Office arrested him in agunfight.   One federal agent was killed. Fifty other union leaders andHernandez Galicia associates also were arrested.   Velazquez said efforts to wipe out union corruption ``must beaccomplished where necessary.'' He did not refer specifically to theOil Workers Union.   But in an informal meeting with reporters after his newsconference, Velazquez did indicate some disagreement with thetactics Salinas used in cracking down on the union.   He said Salinas ``has tried to implant a new politics, using themaximum force of the law to reform attitudes. I don't believe thereis going to be a clash over the new way of politics, although webelieve that they must use other tactics and strategies.''   The Mexican Labor Federation includes the oil workers and claims5 million members of a total national workforce of about 25 million.   Velazquez also said the man chosen to replace the jailedsecretary-general of the oil workers, whose appointment thegovernment opposed, may serve only temporarily.   ``He will only be in charge for the moment,'' he said of RicardoCamero Cardiel, named to replace jailed Salvador Barragan Camacho.``A special general convention will be held to decide the newsecretary-general.''   Velazquez said he would do whatever he could to clean up and savethe union.   ``The future of the oil union is uncertain, but we will fight forits unity and to save the organization,'' Velazquez said.   Government officials last week complained that Camero Cardiel'selection violated union bylaws. They also said he had close ties toBarragan Camacho and Hernandez Galicia, both arrested on weaponscharges during the crackdown on oil union leaders.   The Attorney General's office said 200 Uzi submachine guns werefound inside Hernandez Galicia's home.   Barragan Camacho pleaded innocent to weapons charges Friday in aMexico City hospital where he is undergoing treatment for hearttrouble.   Five of the 51 were released for lack of evidence; bail was setfor 28, and the rest remained in a Mexico City on Monday.   The government news agency Notimex said maximum security measureswere imposed to prevent possible escape attempts by those still incustody, including stringing wires to prevent helicopters fromlanding.   Notimex also said 120 other people, including other oil unionleaders, have sought injunctions against arrest.   Velazquez said he would not personally support Barragan Camachoand Hernandez Galicia, both old acquaintances.   ``Here there is no friendship,'' Velazquez said. ``We will defendthe union, as is our obligation and will continue defending itsworkers.''   He brushed off suggestions that the federation was bowing togovernment pressure by not giving Camero Cardiel his support as theoil union's permanent replacement.</TEXT></DOC>
