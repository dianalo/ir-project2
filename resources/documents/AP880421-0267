Boesky's help in exposing other WallStreet felons is more significant than previously recognized andcould spark new indictments by fall, his lawyers have indicated ina request to cut the convicted speculator's prison sentence.   In seeking to reduce the three-year term, lawyers Leon Silvermanand Robert McCaw also disclosed that federal officials physicallyprotected Boesky from a death threat before he began serving hissentence last month.   They also claim Boesky has been tailed and harassed by others _sometimes using telephone-equipped cars _ he has implicated infinancial felonies.   ``Mr. Boesky has been asked, and has volunteered, informationabout topics, people, relationships, transactions and securitiesthat were not the subject of pre-sentence debriefing sessions,''the document states. ``He has suggested new avenues of inquiry forgovernment investigators.''   The document, filed with U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker lastFriday and made available by his office Wednesday, marked one ofthe clearest public indications yet that Boesky's disclosures willmean a broad range of new indictments. It also provided new insighton the extent of his cooperation.   Boesky's lawyers did not suggest how much the sentence should bereduced. They also asked Lasker not to consider the request untilabout October, claiming by then ``the extraordinary extent andvalue of Mr. Boesky's cooperation will become even more evidentthan it was at sentencing, or than it can be now.''   John Carroll, an assistant U.S. attorney handling the Boeskycase, would not comment on the request or other aspects of thedocument. But he said the government intended to file a writtenresponse with Lasker by Friday.   Once Wall Street's best-known speculator in stocks of companiestargeted for possible takeovers, Boesky stunned the financial worldin November 1986 when he paid the Securities and ExchangeCommission a record $100 million to settle charges he illegallyused secret insider information to profit in securities deals. Hewas banished from the securities business for life.   Boesky has since cooperated in a massive federal probe that hasresulted in four criminal charges in the United States, seven inBritain, four guilty pleas and nine civil actions by the SEC.   In return, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single countof conspiracy to lie to the SEC. He was sentenced to three years infederal prison by Lasker on Dec. 18 and began serving it March 23.   Five days after sentencing, Boesky was back in debriefingsessions with federal prosecutors, his lawyers said in the documentfiled with Lasker. In addition, the document said he has attendedmore than a dozen other meetings since then with agents of theJustice Department, Internal Revenue Service and SEC.   It also said the sessions covered ``new topics, newtransactions, new relationships, and new securities growing out ofMr. Boesky's earlier cooperation and other governmentalinvestigations.''   Boesky also helped investigators in analyzing hundreds ofdocuments involved in its criminal and civil investigations, theplea contended.   His lawyers said Boesky cooperated despite a death threat fromformer friend and fellow speculator John Mulheren, who was arrestedFeb. 18 with a loaded assault rifle, two pistols and a shotgunafter making death threats. Federal prosecutors have since saidthat Boesky implicated Mulheren in illegal conduct.   In a previously undisclosed detail, his lawyers said federalofficials ``took a number of public and private steps to protectMr. Boesky's safety.''   They also said Mulheren's death threat came ``at a time whenother subjects of the United States Attorney's Boesky-relatedinvestigations had Mr. Boesky under physical surveillance.''   They said those people, who weren't identified, hired agents who``watched Mr. Boesky's movements from telephone-equipped cars,followed him on the streets, questioned other patrons atestablishments he utilized and harassed him in various other ways.''</TEXT></DOC>
