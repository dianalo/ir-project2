 Some use satellite for data,while others have video or voice applications.andP;  Theses networks can betotally within Canada, extend to the U.S.andP;  or provide overseas links toEurope and Asia.andM;The reasons why so many organizations have chosen to use satellitecommunications are varied.andP;  The most common motivation is to save money sincesatellite communication can typically save an organization between 20 percent and 40 per cent of its network costs.andP;  However, there are many othervalid reasons for using satellite including improve network reliability; theprovision of a new or improved service to end-users; expanding a businessinto new markets; and, increasing the productivity of that organization.andM;This article will focus on the key trends in satellite communications inCanada -- trends that will lead to many more users in the 1990s.andM;The first trend has already been mentioned: the ever-broadening range ofsatellite communications technology and services.andP;  There are now nine primaryapplication categories:andM;* TV and radio distribution;andM;* telephone networks;andM;* point-to-point;andM;* data broadcast;andM;* VSATs;andM;* business TV;andM;* TSATs;andM;* transportables; and,andM;* mobile communications.andM;Second, we are going to see a tremendous increase in the number of satellitenetworks in Canada, particularly in the area of business and governmentnetworks (both fixed and mobile) and business TV (the use of an in-housesatellite network to improve communications with employees and providetraining programs).andP;  One key area for the 1990s will be Satellite Wide-AreaNetworks (SWANs) that can link local- and metropolitan-area networks intointegrated, multipurpose national and international networks.andM;A third trend is that earth station costs will continue to decrease.andP;  If welook back over the last 10 or more years, we can seen there has been atremendous decrease in costs.andP;  TV receive-only earth stations used to costover $100,000.andP;  Nowadays, we can buy a backyard dish for $1,000-$2,000.andP;  Thistrend will continue and the decrease in hardware costs will be driven bythree factors.andM;Today, there are economies of scale that simply did not exist five or 10years afo when earth stations were manufactured on a one-by-one basis.andP;  Withthousands of earth stations in use in Canada and tens of thousands in theU.S., manufacturers can have true production lines.andM;Earth station costs will also be driven down by technological changes.andP;  Weare seeing the introduction of more and more digital signal processing andlarge-scale integration (LSI) microprocessor chips into earth station design.andO;In fact, the insides of some types of earth stations more closely resemble apersonal computer than traditional earth station hardware.andP;  The advances inLSI technology pioneered by the computer industry will have significantbenefits for earth station costs.andM;The final issue that will help to drive down earth stations costs iscompetition.andP;  There is substantial competition between the different Canadiancompanies selling earth stations to Canadian users.andP;  This competition ishealthy for the market and beneficial to the end-users.andM;For all three reasons, I predict that earth station costs will continue todecline, even though satellite capacity costs will increase if TelesatCanada's new tariff is approved by the Canadian Radio-television andTelecommunications Commission.andP;  The major portion of the cost of mostnetworks is the ground segment, i.e.andP;  the procurement, installation andmaintenance of the earth stations.andP;  The downward trend on the cost of theground segment will outweigh the expected increases in satellite capacitycosts.andM;We are also seeing the start of a convergence between personal computers andearth stations.andP;  Norsat, a Vancouver-based company, already sells a smalldata receive-only earth station that is an expansion board that slots into apersonal computer.andP;  The antenna on the roof plugs directly into the computer.andO;I predict that we will see an extension of this approach in the years ahedand the incorporation of transmit/receive earth stations into personalcomputers.andM;In the future, we will view earth stations built into PCs in the same way inwhich we currently regard modems: as an integral part of the personalcomputer.andP;  The impact of this trend will be to further reduce the cost ofearth stations.andM;The changes in earth station technology are being matched by equivalentchanges in satellite design.andP;  The present generation of satellites arebasically sophisticated amplifiers in the sky.andP;  The new satellites that willbe launched in the early part of this decade, such as Telesat's Anik e, willgenerally be larger, more powerful version of this existing type ofsatellite.andP;  However, we are starting to see a new generation of satellites onthe drawing boards with features such as on-board call processing andinter-satellite links.andM;One of the most interesting of these new systems is &quot;Iridium,&quot; recentlyunveiled by Motorola (see CC, Aug. 2, 1990, page 37).andP;  This system wouldallow people to communicate by telephone anywhere on earth--whether on land,at sea or in the air.andM;Users will not need to know the location of the person being called; theywill simply dial that person's number to be connected instantly.andP;  The Iridiumsystem combines the technology of cellular telephones and satellitecommunications.andM;The Iridium system will use a total of 77 satellites in low-earth orbit (413nautical miles).andP;  This means the satellite will be moving quite fast relativeto a user on earth.andP;  Each of the Iridium satellites will incorporate aswitching function very similar to that of a cellular telephone switch.andP;  Asone satellite heads for the horizon, there will be an automatic hand-off toanother satellite that has just come over the horizon.andP;  This will provide aseamless communications service to every user in the world.andM;There are also significant changes in the area of satellite policy andregulation.andP;  If we look back over the last 10-15 years, we can see a verygradual but deliberate deregulation of the satellite industry.andP;  Today, anyonecan own and operate a satellite up-link for a network in Canada, providedsome basic conditions are met.andP;  The area of resale and sharing of satelliteservice is also wide-open, with only a few restrictions.andP;  However, there isscope for more deregulation in the future.andP;  The next restrictions likely tobe eased are those on transborder networks.andM;At the time of writing this article (August 1990) the basic rule is that onlyTelesat Canada can own transmit earth stations working into the U.S.andO;irrespective of whether a Canadian or U.S.andP;  satellite is used.andP;  This area isbeing reviewed by the Federal Department of Communications and a formalCanada Gazette notice was published in September 1989.andM;We can also expect to see simplifications in the process for getting earthstation licenses.andP;  In the U.S.andP;  for example, some types of very smallaperture satellites (VSATs) can be licensed on a network basis, rather thaneach VSAT requiring an individual licence.andP;  I predict that the Canadianregulations will be modified in the two to three years to allow this to takeplace in Canada.andM;Finally, we can look forward to a reduction in the restrictions oninterconnecting satellite and terrestrial networks.andP;  There are existingrestrictions that vary from one jurisdiction to another.andP;  Restrictions thatcan be very frustrating for both suppliers and users of satellite networks.andO;As part of an overall national telecommunications policy, I expect there willbe a move towards a consistent set of interconnection rules without theregional variations we now experience.andP;  Not only will the rules bestandardized across the country -- they will also be liberalized.andM;Finally, a few words about the impact of the Canada-U.S.andP;  Free TradeAgreement (FTA).andM;The key part of the FTA is that there is little change in the stauts quo forsatellite services.andP;  Canadia users cannot deal directly with the U.S.andO;satellite carriers, and Canadian carriers cannot deal directly with U.S.andO;customers.andP;  A satellite carrier in one country must deal through a satellitecarrier in the other country when transborder satellite networks are beingmarketed and implemented.andP;  However, under the FTA, a carrier based in onecountry can set up and incorporate a subsidiary in the other country withoutfear of that country's government discriminating between the subsidiary andexisting domestically-owned value-added carriers.andM;We have not seen a great flood of U.S.andP;  satellite carriers incorporatingsubsidiaries in Canada.andP;  The reason is that to be successful in thisbusiness, a company needs far more than a legal subsidiary.andP;  A successfulsatellite supplier needs to have the infrastructure comprising the marketingteam, the earth station installation and maintenance teams, the warehousingfacilities for spare parts, and the know-how to license earth stations inCanada.andP;  If is such easier, less expensive, and far less risky if a U.S.andO;company forms a teaming arrangement with a Canadian company that is alreadyin the business.andP;  This has been the trend during the 1980s and I predict itwill continue during the 1990s.andM;Barrie Kirk is vice-president, Satellite Information Services division ofTelesat Canada Communications Inc. of Gloucester, Ont.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
