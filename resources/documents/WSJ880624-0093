The topic is Moses; the book, Exodus. The former president quizzes his class like a schoolmaster: &quot;How did the Hebrew women survive? Why?&quot;    Then, softly, as if reaching deep within himself, Mr. Carter assures his audience: &quot;God has a purpose for every person in his world. . . . Under pressure, we grow. We become aware of a degree of resilience in us we might not have been aware of before.&quot;    Under pressure, surviving his political wilderness, Jimmy Carter has grown. Resilient, driven by a New Testament sense of stewardship, he is doing things no other former president has ever done -- or contemplated. Personally working to eradicate the Guinea worm parasite in Africa, for example. Building, with his own sweat and claw hammer, homes for the homeless.    He is also edging back into the limelight. In four weeks, he will speak in a prime-time slot at the Democratic convention, to be held in his native Georgia. And as the 1988 campaign heats up, he has become an issue yet again, with George Bush attacking his record and trying to paint Michael Dukakis as a Carter with a Boston accent.    But Mr. Bush may be behind the times in his attacks on the former president. Despite Mr. Carter's record-low approval ratings while he was in office, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that Americans now approve of the way he handled his job, by 47% to 43%. By comparison, another ex-president on the rebound, Richard Nixon, still has negative ratings.    It isn't only the public that has a higher estimation of Mr. Carter these days; he is also gaining respect among top presidential scholars. &quot;We made Jimmy Carter a scapegoat for the problems of the late '70s,&quot; says Erwin Hargrove, a Vanderbilt University political scientist. &quot;History will treat him more kindly.&quot; Charles O. Jones, a University of Wisconsin political scientist, calls Mr. Carter a classic example of &quot;a man using his independent judgment to try to do what he thought was right&quot; -- with all the inherent perils of such a course.    The revisionist scholars aren't calling Mr. Carter great or near-great. They see him as someone who unnecessarily alienated Congress, was unable to project a coherent national agenda and was ultimately buffeted by events. But some do now rate him an average or better president who pitched -- awkwardly but head-on -- into the toughest issues of his time and emerged with scattered triumphs.    &quot;What Carter lacks, and this is what makes him appealing as a human being, is a mask,&quot; Mr. Hargrove concludes. &quot;It may be that to be a genius politician, you have to have that mask.&quot;    Since leaving office in January 1981, Mr. Carter also has been viewed -- unfairly, contends George Washington University historian Leo Ribuffo -- as &quot;the great aberration of recent American history.&quot; But he is perhaps better seen as a transitional figure in history -- a little like Moses, who led the Israelites toward a strange new land, only to perish in the journey.    To the Democratic Party, scholars say, his presidency represents a squandered opportunity to adapt to, not a Promised Land, but the cheerless economic and political confines of a post-liberal era. Michael Dukakis, if elected, may pay for this failure.    &quot;Dukakis will inherit the same exhaustion of ideas that Carter did,&quot; predicts Mr. Hargrove, whose own book on the Carter presidency comes out this fall. &quot;And the liberals will make demands of him he won't be able to meet.&quot;    &quot;They will,&quot; agrees Mr. Carter with quiet certainty. In an interview, he reflects on his presidency with detachment, tinged with bitterness.    &quot;The liberals want 100%,&quot; he says. &quot;And if you can't give it to them, you're their enemy. The Kennedy wing just gave me hell. They thought I was a traitor to Democratic Party principles. If you get Dukakis in there, they're going to jump on him. But coming from Massachusetts, he'll be better able to adapt than I was.&quot;    Mr. Carter concedes that, politically, his wife was right all along: She repeatedly urged him to postpone some tough political issues to a second term. (Others did, too. The Carter library in Atlanta contains this plaintive 1978 memo from media adviser Gerald Rafshoon: &quot;Please, Mr. President, we need some good, visible domestic victories before we solve the world's problems.&quot;) But this stubborn, straight-ahead man -- a fisherman who estimates he cast 11,000 times before hooking his first Atlantic salmon -- rejected such advice then. He rejects it now.    &quot;It's my nature to assess a problem and try to move aggressively to solve it,&quot; he says. &quot;That's just the way I am.&quot;    Character is fate, a truism through which Mr. Jones sees all the strengths and weaknesses of the Carter presidency. In his new book, &quot;The Trusteeship Presidency,&quot; Mr. Jones interprets the Carter years as a 20th-century attempt to govern by the principle of an 18th-century statesman, Edmund Burke. That principle is that what a politician most owes his constituents is his independent judgment -- unpopular or not.    &quot;A trustee takes on the difficult issues first, not the easy ones,&quot; Mr. Jones says. &quot;The Panama Canal treaty is a perfect example. And no pure trustee is going to want to be 'political.' The notion that Jimmy Carter should have been like Lyndon Johnson is crazy.&quot;    But a trustee is alone on a high wire. Jimmy Carter alienated Congress, a collection of smart people with their own agendas. And by promising to always do &quot;right,&quot; he invited measurement against impossible standards. &quot;The difference between Reagan and Carter is that Reagan can extract victory from defeat,&quot; says Mr. Jones, &quot;whereas Carter couldn't even extract victory from victory.&quot;    Today George Bush pounds at Jimmy Carter like a triphammer, invoking his years as a metaphor for Democratic disaster: &quot;Double-digit inflation . . . savings going right up in smoke . . . malaise.&quot; The tactic has obvious potential. Even Democrats concede it's no compliment to compare Mr. Dukakis or any other politician with Jimmy Carter. Johnny Carson says that &quot;having your campaign endorsed by Jimmy Carter is like having your ministry endorsed by Jimmy Swaggart.&quot;    But attacking the Carter era also has limitations. The Journal/NBC poll found that one-third of voters say they view him more favorably now than they did while he was in office, while one-fifth regard him less favorably. And some Reagan administration failures make elements of the Carter record look good by comparison. The combined four-year Carter budget deficit was $227 billion; the eight-year Reagan deficit is projected to top $1.3 trillion. The Carter administration had nothing comparable to the Iran-Contra scandal, or the sucession of top Reagan officials who have been haled into court.    Jimmy Carter's Iran hostage ordeal was a national humiliation, but he did get the hostages out alive. President Reagan still has U.S. hostages in Lebanon and lost 241 American servicemen in a futile peacekeeping mission there.    Mr. Carter believes the vice president's repeated attacks on him are actually &quot;good for the Democrats. It shows his inability to talk about his own issues,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a sign of weakness on his part.&quot;    There's another limitation to Carter-bashing: People often sympathize with the man, if not his record. They don't blame him for causing the problems, says one Democratic pollster, but just see him as being unable to deal with them.    President Reagan's pollster, Richard Wirthlin, records a curious and continuing ambivalence. Periodically, Mr. Wirthlin asks people to register their feelings toward public figures on a &quot;thermometer,&quot; where 100 degrees represents love and zero hate. Mr. Carter's latest reading, last October, was 51 degrees -- exactly his reading of May 1980. By comparison, the Ayatollah Khomeini rated nine degrees, General Motors Chairman Roger Smith 55 and Nancy Reagan 61.    The verdict: &quot;Neither hot nor cold,&quot; says Mr. Wirthlin.    Things may be looking up. At the Mondale convention of 1984, there was long, embarrassing haggling over when and how long Mr. Carter would be allowed to speak, according to his Georgia friend Bert Lance. But months ago, Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk publicly invited him to address this year's Atlanta convention. And almost every 1988 Democratic presidential candidate made a pilgrimage to Mr. Carter. Mr. Dukakis met him at 6 a.m. in New York: two focused, disciplined men, already at work while others slept.    Mr. Carter emphasizes that he isn't &quot;looking for a job in Washington&quot; should Mr. Dukakis win. But &quot;I would take some particular {temporary} assignment . . . promoting peace in the Middle East, promoting human rights.&quot;    In any event, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have settled back into the quiet rhythms of this modest little town. A quarter-mile beyond their unpretentious home, a neighbor parks a tractor on a side lawn; a quarter-mile the other way lie the red clay and wooded fields of south Georgia. Like any other parishioners, the Carters take their turn mowing the churchyard lawn. His 13-week discussion of Moses will run into September.    A bubble of warmth surrounds Mr. Carter when he travels now, as on his recent tour promoting his new book, &quot;An Outdoor Journal.&quot; People reach out to comfort him, rather as they might a family member who had survived some serious illness. They snap his picture, thrust forth papers for autographs. On a flight to the West Coast, a high-school choir back in coach asked to serenade him -- and got a note from first class: &quot;OK by me. JC.&quot;    &quot;I don't grieve about it,&quot; he says of his 1980 landslide loss. &quot;I don't lose sleep over it.&quot; He has built, as painstakingly as the Shaker-like chairs he turns out in his workshop, a new outlet for his drive and Baptist idealism. The Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, adjacent to the presidential library, is far more than a think tank. It's a social-action agency.    &quot;We're here to address problems so big they have to be addressed, problems so bad that nobody else addresses them,&quot; says executive director William H. Foege.    There's nothing glamorous, nothing merely symbolic, about these problems. Last spring, Mr. Carter went to Africa to oversee a Center program to eradicate the Guinea worm, a parasite that grows more than two feet long inside the victim's body. Other projects include introducing new crop hybrids to African subsistence farmers and immunizing Third World children against disease. Recently he and Gerald Ford, a good friend now, announced a bipartisan program to ease the transition of incoming presidents.    Can he imagine similar projects with an ex-President Reagan? A cloud seems to darken Mr. Carter's face, and he hesitates just an instant before replying: &quot;Not really.&quot; Mr. Carter is coldly furious at what he regards as repeated Reagan distortions of fact. &quot;Well, he just doesn't know how to tell the truth,&quot; the former president told an Emory University magazine last year, adding that the real question is whether Reagan misstatements are &quot;deliberate, or out of ignorance.&quot;    But such public expressions of anger are rare. Jimmy Carter remains a controlled and private man, quietly going about his business. Regularly, without fanfare, the former president saws boards and pounds nails for Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit group that builds homes for the homeless. His first project, in 1981, took him and Mrs. Carter to a derelict home in the Bronx; she scraped linoleum off the floor. Another Habitat project found him amid the grit and dirt of New York's Lower East Side, calling out advice: &quot;Don't fall in a hole, anybody!&quot;    He is driven, he says, by &quot;a sense of pleasant obligation.&quot; He seems at peace, fulfilled. He takes things in stride, even an unruly passenger on a recent flight.    Obviously feeling no pain, the passenger up ahead abruptly flipped his damp face cloth over his shoulder and into the air. It landed with a sodden plop -- on the eating tray of the former president of the United States.    Jimmy Carter eyed the face cloth, then the passenger. &quot;That's OK,&quot; he said. &quot;I've had worse things thrown at me.&quot;    ---   Compared to when Jimmy Carter was in office, has your opinion of him gotten better or gotten worse?
