WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis kept up his attack against George Bushon the evironment Saturday, saying the Democrats would win theWhite House and put an end to years of ``desecrating our heritage.''   Republican Bush was taking the weekend off from campaigningbefore flying to California on Monday to welcome back the spaceshuttle and its astronauts.   The vice presidential candidates, Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and DanQuayle, spent much of Saturday preparing for their onlyface-to-face debate of the campaign, Wednesday night's nationallytelevised confrontation in Omaha, Neb.   A Quayle spokesman said the Indiana senator met with PresidentReagan at the White House and later had a mock debate with Sen. BobPackwood, R-Ore., standing in for Bentsen. Spokesman David Prosperisaid of the meeting with Reagan, ``The senator was looking foradvice and counsel from the president who has participated in quitea few presidential debates in his lifetime.''   Bentsen spoke briefly to reporters in Washington after astrategy session with four fellow Democrats in Congress. He saidsimply, ``Their advice is to be myself'' in the debate.   Former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson urged acrowd at a voter-registration rally in Chicago to support Dukakisover Bush, whom he called ``mean-spirited.''   Jackson said Bush's attacks on Dukakis for being a member of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union amounted to ``a back-handed swipe atthe entire civil rights community, not just the ACLU.''   ``You see, Mr. Bush, you call people who fight for libertysubversive,'' Jackson said, accusing Bush of being on an ``ugly andmean side of history.''   Dukakis was the only candidate on the campaign trail Saturday,pledging at a rally near the Golden Gate Bridge to declare morethan half California's coastline ``marine sanctuaries'' to protectit from offshore oil drilling.   ``Our environment can't take four more years of damage andneglect,'' Dukakis said. ``Starting on Jan. 20, 1989, we're goingto stop desecrating our heritage and start preserving andprotecting our environment once again.''   Dukakis spoke while standing before fog-shrouded San FranciscoBay and Golden Gate Bridge, addressing a crowd of 2,000 people ormore at a sandy stretch of U.S. Park Service-protected land.   He has previously opposed offshore oil drilling in areas alongCalifornia's coast, and in the spring Bush changed his position toback a temporary halt in the sale of drilling leases in sections ofthe state. Aides said Dukakis does not oppose drilling in all areasbut in those deemed ``environmentally sensitive.''   Dukakis renewed his blasts at Bush's environmental record,saying the vice president had supported controversial InteriorSecretary James Watt, had supported vetoes of the Clean Water Act,had fought to keep harmful lead in gasoline and ``still supportsdrilling for offshore oil in the most environmentally sensitiveareas.''   ``George Bush is trying to throw his environmental recordoverboard in this campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``That's a case ofocean dumping we're going to stop right now.''   Dukakis said he would designate sanctuary along the coast fromBig Sur, south of Monterey, north to the Oregon border, an areacovering more than half the 1,200-mile shoreline that Californiaenvironmentalists have sought to have protected from drilling. Healso promised to consider portions of other coastal states.   He has been focusing on the environment in his bid to become thefirst Democrat since 1964 to carry California. On his last trip tothe state, Dukakis pledged to make the Environmental ProtectionAgency a Cabinet department.   The Massachusetts governor also has been critiized by Bush onthe environmental issue, in television ads blaming Dukakis forpollution in Boston Harbor.   Dukakis answered back in his speech, ``I'll tell you one kind ofgarbage the people of Boston won't harbor _ and that's GeorgeBush's claim to be an environmentalist.''   Earlier, Dukakis stopped at a children's soccer field inSacramento, where he talked with the kids and kicked a soccer ball,kicking two balls into the goal and sailing one over it.   Elsewhere in California, at Edwards Air Force Base, a Bushcampaign spokesman said the vice president wanted to be the firstperson to greet the returning astronauts when they get out of thespace shuttle Discovery after landing there Monday.   Bush figures to gain favorable publicity by his appearance atthe end of a space mission widely hailed by Americans. However, hisspokesman said Bush would be there by virtue of his office, not asa candidate for the presidency.   Bush himself said last week that inviting Dukakis to the eventwould turn it into a political event.   Dukakis declined to comment directly when asked about former CIADirector Stansfield Turner's contention that Turner took PanamanianGen. Manuel Noriega off the agency's payroll when he took over fromBush but that Bush reinstated Noriega after becoming vice presidentin 1981.   The Democrat did say, ``Maybe at the next debate we'll get a fewstraight answers out of Mr. Bush'' about his relationship withNoriega.   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said Friday that Turner's allegationthat Bush had reinstated Noriega was ``absolutely untrue.''</TEXT></DOC>
