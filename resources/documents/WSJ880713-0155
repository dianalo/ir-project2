Hauser </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Portland, Ore.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It is a tradition here to pretend that picking up sailors is a civic duty. The arrival of numerous Navy vessels is a high point of the annual Portland Rose Festival, and is eagerly awaited by thousands of civic-minded women.    These days girl meets sailor boy by filling out a guest request form (in triplicate) or phoning her request to one of three unblushing volunteer operators at the Rose Festival's Dial-A-Sailor headquarters. &quot;Guest&quot; is our new word for sailor, and &quot;hostess&quot; is our word for girl.    During Rose Festivals of yore, folks used to say, &quot;Well, the Navy's comin' up river to spawn,&quot; and the hostesses who met the ships had beehive hairdos, tight skirts and black eyelashes that stuck together.    Since the Dial-A-Sailor program began 13 years ago, it is considered hospitable to pick up a sailor, especially if you are a church group. But if you are a hostess, you will hear from a sailor sooner.    Emboldened by the revered status now given to Portlanders hospitable enough to dial a sailor, I dialed. The application had a section for special requests. I requested &quot;sweet young thing from Kansas.&quot; I figured he'd be seasick and I could comfort him.    I noticed that on another application the prospective hostess had written STUD under special requests. When my guest finally called and revealed himself to be a Marine from California and not a sailor from Kansas, I wondered what the girl who asked for a stud got.    Diane Blum, volunteer coordinator for Dial-A-Sailor, was apologetic that I didn't get what I wanted. &quot;But Susan,&quot; she said, &quot;they're all the same.&quot; To make it up to me, she promised a two-fer. If I kept the Marine she'd throw in a sailor.    My sailor turned out to be an officer, but who's complaining when everyone salutes you as you walk down the street? The only drawback was that my Marine guest had to salute him, too. He also had to call him &quot;Sir.&quot; My naval officer guest called my Marine guest &quot;Corporal.&quot; Both of them called me &quot;Ma'am.&quot; I could tell it was going to be a hot date.    Frankly, I was relieved at my guests' good manners and shy demeanor, especially since the local newspaper reported that the Marines had run out of condoms in Portland. An emergency shipment went astray and thousands sent from Camp Pendleton were misdelivered to Portland Mayor Bud Clark, who is famous for having posed as a flasher in an art poster.    Hoping to steer the conversation toward uncontroversial ground, I asked my guests if they were still wearing their original hats since coming to town. A friend, experienced in rolling out the red carpet for sailors, had told me that the customary expression of welcome from exceptionally hospitable women was: &quot;Hey, sailor. Can I have your hat?&quot; And the customary response was: &quot;How're ya gonna pay for it?&quot; (Exit, pursued by a hostess.)    My Marine guest admitted that he'd lost his hat about the same time he'd lost his senses. It seems that as his ship was mooring there was a boatload of bikinied city boosters offering to give him and his shipmates an eyeful if they threw their hats across the water.    My officer guest said he'd already had three requests for his dress hat, but since it cost him 50 bucks he was not about to give it up. However, he said, his ship had stocked up on 600 extra sailor caps before embarking for Portland.    Both of my guests remarked that Portland is considered one of the best ports for shore leave. The ultimate is a tossup between Portland and Perth, Australia, where the natives also are very hospitable.    There are, of course, some places in the world where the sight of a man in uniform does not cause a hormone rush and where townsfolk put up such signs as: &quot;Sailors Keep Off the Grass.&quot; My officer guest said one of the least hospitable places he'd visited was Subic Bay, the Philippines. There, he said, the women pinch men.    How rude.    After dinner I walked my guests back to their ships. Directly back. Without passing go. Before we parted, my officer guest ran on board and came back with a hat for me.    Since the fleet has departed from Portland, I have worn my hat to several social engagements. The women always draw away from me and begin to point and whisper. Usually a bold one will frostily inquire, &quot;What did you have to do to get that hat?&quot;    C'mon girls. Haven't you ever heard of Dial-A-Sailor? Don't you know the meaning of hospitality?    ---   Ms. Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Portland, Ore. </TEXT></DOC>
