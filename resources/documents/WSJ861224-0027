Jack A. Robinson, chairman and chief executive officer, declined to predict earnings for the year ending Oct. 31, other than to say that they will exceed the year earlier's $5.9 million, or 59 cents a share.    He said the company is off to a good start in the first quarter. In November, for example, sales rose 19%. Although sales in the early part of December have been &quot;sort of dragging,&quot; the last 10 days of the month are likely to be brisk, Mr. Robinson said in an interview.    Perry operates drugstores, health care units and auto parts retailing stores. Mr. Robinson said increased sales in fiscal 1987 will come from existing as well as planned new stores. The company will add 70 new units by the end of the fiscal year; it currently has 450 units.    Mr. Robinson said the current fiscal year &quot;is not going to be a big acquisition year.&quot; Last year, the company acquired 20 auto parts stores, seven drugstores, and one clinical and one surgical supply outlet. Capital spending in 1987 will fall to $21 million from $27 million last year, he said.    The company's auto parts business, which accounts for about 22% of sales, will show better results compared with last year, Mr. Robinson said. In fiscal 1986, car-part sales &quot;were softer than expected&quot; because of strong new-car sales in that year, he said. Perry retails auto parts for the used-car market. </TEXT></DOC>
