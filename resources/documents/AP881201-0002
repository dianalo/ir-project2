Ortega asked the U.S. Embassy for more than 20 visas for hisentourage, La Prensa said in its afternoon edition.   Nicaraguan government sources told The Associated Press they wereunable to confirm the visa request because Ortega has been in Mexicosince Sunday. He is in Mexico to attend the inauguration ofPresident-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Thursday.   La Prensa said that Ortega plans to leave for the United Statesnext weekend, shortly after returning from Mexico.   ``It is not known if Gorbachev's tight schedule in New Yorkincludes a visit with Ortega,'' La Prensa said.   Gorbachev plans to meet with President Reagan and President-electGeorge Bush on Dec. 5.   ``Political observers and diplomats'' said Ortega's tripindicated ``Sandinista concern about possible negotiation betweenthe two powers regarding Soviet presence in Nicaragua,'' La Prensasaid.   In a separate editorial, La Prensa said that ``for Gorbachev todevelop his perestroika ... he must seek better relations with theUnited States.''   ``Here is where Nicaragua enters the picture,'' the paper said.``The Sandinistas with their politics of alignment toward the SovietUnion have put Nicaragua into the field of the East-West fight,making a place for itself in the agenda for any dialogue between thesuperpowers.... Ortega's potential trip to New York confirms that.''   The paper also said, ``Ortega runs to the United Nations,undoubtedly to seek concessions from the Soviet delegation.''   Perestroika, Russian for restructuring, refers to Gorbachev'sprogram for reforming Soviet economy and society for efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
