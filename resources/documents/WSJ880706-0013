Meanwhile, as the Reagan administration began seeking answers to the questions surrounding the incident, some legislators called for the U.S. to pay compensation to Iran. In addition, officials confirmed that President Reagan sent a message Sunday to Tehran conveying &quot;deep regrets&quot; over the accident in the Persian Gulf, in which 290 people died.    Dan Howard, a Pentagon spokesman, said a &quot;substantial factor&quot; in the decision of the captain of the USS Vincennes to fire was that the Iranian airliner was emitting signals &quot;previously identified with F-14&quot; fighter aircraft. Iran has about a half-dozen operating F-14s purchased from the U.S. during the reign of the shah.    Adding to the confusion surrounding the incident, Mr. Howard said, the Iranian jetliner also was transmitting identifying signals usually associated with civilian aircraft.    Mr. Howard conceded that there were still several unanswered questions concerning the airliner, which was downed about seven minutes after taking off from Bandar Abbas, an Iranian airfield used by both civilian and military aircraft, on a routine flight across the Persian Gulf to Dubai. There are conflicting reports concerning the plane's flight path, its altitude and whether it was ascending or descending when it was struck. A Navy investigating team from the Pentagon arrived in Bahrain yesterday to try to resolve the conflicts.    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said the administration should go beyond apologizing and offer compensation to the families of the victims. &quot;If that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved party, surely we could do that,&quot; he said in London. &quot;Congress would support that if it were requested.&quot;    Virginia Sen. John Warner, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also called for compensation, although he added that the U.S. should wait until all the facts are in.    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said discussion of compensation is &quot;premature&quot; until the investigation is completed. &quot;There are questions that remain and we're going to get the answers to those questions before discussing anything about the question of reparations,&quot; she said.    Mrs. Oakley also said that the president's regrets to Iran, conveyed through the Swiss, stated the U.S. &quot;would continue to work for an end to the (Iran-Iraq) war,&quot; and hopes Iran will, too. U.S. officials said Washington is willing to talk to representatives of the Khomeini regime, but won't respond to feelers from Iranians purporting to represent one faction or another in Tehran.    In Iran, top officials appeared to disagree on whether to seek revenge against the U.S. Iranian radio quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying Iran has the &quot;right to avenge the blood of innocent children, men and women.&quot; The radio also said Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's designated successor, called for &quot;revolutionary cells . . . inside and outside Iran . . . to unleash their wrath on American financial, political and military targets everywhere.&quot;    But Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament and military chief, sounded a more cautious note, warning that a clumsy attempt at retaliation could divert attention from the downing of the airliner. &quot;We do not permit ourselves to give up revenge. But the timing is up to us, not America,&quot; Mr. Rafsanjani told parliament, according to Tehran Radio.    U.S. intelligence analysts conceded that they have little insight into the machinations of the Iranian leadership. &quot;We don't know what the Iranians do, and anybody in this town who says he does is a charlatan,&quot; one official told a State Department meeting yesterday morning. Added a Pentagon official: &quot;All we can do is wait for the next shoe to drop.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
