The State and the mining industry requirereliable official estimates of the economically mineable coal reservesfor planning purposes. An overview of all the previous reserve estimatesis given, with specific attention to the two most recent estimates -those of Petrick and de Jager. The differences between these two estimatesare highlighted. The following important aspects are discussed: the needto update the information regarding South Africa's mineable coal reserves,the necessity of understanding and agreement between the coal-miningindustry and the State department responsible for updating the coal-reservedata, and the importance of the specific assumptions used in the updatingof the data. A downward adjustment of mineable reserve figures is proposed,and the factors that influence the meaningful exploitation of the coalreserves are discussed. A recommendation is made as to how the Waterbergcoal reserve should be exploited, and it is concluded that the SoutpansbergCoalfield cannot be exploited economically in the foreseeable future.An evaluation of the status of the coal-export trade is made and comparedwith the assumptions and targets set at the start of the coal-exportationscheme. Recommendations are made regarding planning for the coal-exportmarket, and the aspects that have to be taken into account to keep SouthAfrica in the export market are identified. Reference is made to thefact that the present unrestrained wage and salary adjustments, whichshow a total disregard of South Africa's poor productivity record, requireserious thought and speedy rectification if the country is to survivein the export market. A salary and wage strategy must be developed tosuit the specific needs of the Republic of South Africa. 13 refs., 7figs., 24 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
