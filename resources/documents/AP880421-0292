Until about 1950, when more food was needed, larger cropswere planted.   But from that point on, farmers relied on boosting theproductivity of their land to get more bushels from fewer acres,says Lester R. Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute, a private,non-profit research organization based in Washington, D.C.   And to do that, he said, farmers rapidly became hooked on oil _the fossil-based energy that provides fuel for tractors andirrigation pumps. The fossil fuels, which include natural gas, alsobecame a giant provider of chemical fertilizers used to boostper-acre yields.   The basic problem, says Brown in World Watch magazine, is thatwhere once there were lakes of oil beneath the surface of America,there are now only puddles.   ``In North America, which produces nearly one-fifth of theworld's grain, 80 percent of the oil discovered to date already hasbeen burned,'' he said. ``Current proven reserves in the UnitedStates total 36 billion barrels, enough to supply domestic needsfor less than nine years at current rates of use.''   The problem is not confined to the United States. The ThirdWorld countries which have rising food demands, no oil reserves andlimited funds for expanding imports could be headed for traumatictimes.   The Indian subcontinent, which has nearly a billion people tofeed _ and, according to World Bank projections, another billion onthe way before population growth stops _ has less than 1 percent ofthe world's oil reserves.   China, which also has a billion people, is expected to show onlymodest population growth and is in somewhat better shape. But ithas only 3 percent of the global oil reserves.   ``The Middle East, with reserves of 398 billion barrels, lies atthe other end of spectrum,'' Brown said. ``It has 56 percent of theworld's oil reserves and only 4 percent of the people. Moreover,the Middle East's share of the remaining world oil reserves isrising as reserves outside the region are rapidly depleted.''   Brown said that while OPEC _ the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries _ has had difficulties agreeing on productionstrategy, ``the growing Middle East control of the world's oil issetting the stage for prices to rise in the not-too-distantfuture.''   He added: ``With petroleum reserves concentrated in one regionand with food production becoming more oil-dependent, food securityand access to oil are becoming closely entwined issues.''   Brown noted that as the 20th century began, the world's farmerswere almost entirely energy self-sufficient. The sun providedenergy for crops to grow, livestock provided fertilizer and animalpower for tillage. Farmers supplied labor for planting andharvesting.   Today, on the average, the world's farmers use the equivalent ofmore than a barrel of oil to produce a ton of grain. Each year, hesaid, it takes more.   ``Since 1950, agriculture's use of fossil fuels has multipliedsixfold,'' Brown said. ``Between 1950 and 1985, the farm tractorfleet quadrupled, world irrigated area tripled, and fertilizer useincreased ninefold.''   Despite agriculture's heavy reliance on oil, its share of worldoil use remains small, so a shortage of oil for food production isnot of immediate concern, he said.   ``The economics of food production are, however, increasinglyshaped by the price of oil,'' Brown said. ``Moreover, in contrastto some other important oil-using activities _ such as electricitygeneration, which is reducing its dependence on oil _ agriculture'sreliance on oil is rising, making it more vulnerable to futureprice increases.''   Some observations:   _Draft animals are still used extensively for tillage in Africaand Asia, but the real workhorses of modern agriculture aretractors. As much as two-thirds of the world's cropland may now beplowed with tractors. The global tractor fleet has increased fromfewer than 6 million in 1950 to 24 million today.   _World use of chemical fertilizers soared from 14 million to 131million tons between 1950 and 186. As cropland area per persondeclined, fertilizer use per person increased. This increase waslargely reponsible for world grain production climbing to 1.66billion metric tons from 624 million during the same period.   However, in some agriculturally advanced countries fertilizeruse is leveling off. In the United States, for example, fertilizeruse peaked in 1981 and then dropped as land prices and the farmeconomy weakened.   _Irrigation today ranks third behind tractors and fertilizer asan energy user. In 1900, world irrigation encompassed an estimated100 million acres. By 1950, it grew to 230 million acres. Today,the irrigated area is about 670 million acres and has contributedgreatly to record advances in global food production. That includesthe use of both surface water and underground sources, whichrequire energy-intensive pumping to get it to crops.   ``The worldwide production of oil and grain has moved inopposite directions since 1978. Both moved steadily upward from1950 to 1978, but since then, oil production has fallen while grainoutput has continued to go up,'' Brown said.   ``More importantly,'' he added, ``the demand for grain isprojected to rise until at least the middle of the next century,while oil production is projected to decline over the same period.''   Brown said the challenge to the world's agricultural scientistsis to devise less energy intensive methods of expanding world foodoutput. Recent moves by American farmers to ``minimum till'' and``no-till'' crop production is a step in that direction, he said.   Another move has been Brazil's use of more tractors usingethanol, or fuel alcohol made from sugarcane.   ``Agriculture cannot expand its use of petroleum indefinitely ina world where oil production is falling,'' Brown said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday April 24</NOTE></DOC>
