(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Middleton stood by a pavementcrack left by the earthquake along the wharf on the Port ofOakland's Seventh Street Public Container Terminal and took a linefrom a watch commercial.   ``The Port of Oakland,'' Middleton, a port spokesman, saidWednesday. ``It takes a licking, but keeps on ticking.''   Officials are still toting up the damage from last week'searthquake, but it appears the port _ the nation's fourth-largestand the biggest in the Bay area _ suffered about $70 million worthof damage, said James J. O'Brien, executive director oftransportation services for the port.   Most of that can be accounted for at the Seventh Streetterminal, which also accounted for about 7 percent of the 14.7million revenue tons of cargo that moved through the port last year.   The terminal's three huge container cranes can't run up and downthe wharf because their tracks were knocked off level by the quake.There is no good idea when they will be ready to go again.   However, nine other terminals remain in operation, and portofficials have been berthing ships normally handled at SeventhStreet at other terminals so they won't have to be turned away.   ``At the moment, we have the capacity to accommodate all ourpresent customers with a lot of cooperation,'' O'Brien said. ``Weare not out to bring in any new users at this point until we getthe Seventh Street facility back on line.''   With news of the earthquake flashed around the world, the portis working to maintain the confidence of its shippers throughrepresentatives in Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Taipai, Tokyo, and Seoul.   Reports of heavy congestion around Los Angeles during the 1984Olympics caused some shippers to divert cargo to Oakland and nowOakland hopes to escape having the tables turned, Middleton said.   The Port of Oakland serves about 1,500 ships a year and 88percent of the cargoes come in containers. Oakland handles 90percent of the container cargo moving through the Golden Gate.   Cargos headed out tend to be raw materials, agricultural goodsand partially finished goods. Cargoes coming in tend to be consumergoods. About 90 percent of the shipping is on the Pacific Rim,though some comes from Europe and South America.   The same seismic forces that swayed the Bay Bridge so much thata section of the upper deck fell also hit the 2-decade-old SeventhStreet Terminal, heaving up a big crack where the wharf, supportedby concrete pilings driven down the bedrock, meets the yard, whichrests on fill.   The jolt shook the wharf, sheering off the row of batter pilesat the top, he said. The batter piles are a set of two diagonalconcrete pilings that come together like an A-frame. Forming a rowfarthest from the water side of the wharf, they were designed toprotect the wharf from the sideways shake of an earthquake.   When they failed, the wharf tilted, lowering the crane tracks onthe water side several inches _ enough to put the cranes out ofcommission.   The wharf will likely have to be replaced, and there is notelling how long that will take, said Steve Kappler, civil engineerfor the port.   But it offers a lesson to engineers on how to build a wharf towithstand an earthquake.   The wharf stood up at the Howard Terminal, which was built in1980 with the benefit of more advanced understanding of earthquakeengineering, though a container crane was knocked off its tracks.</TEXT></DOC>
