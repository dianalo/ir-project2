A written Iraqi statement dismissed Iran's position as ``fantasyto explain its flight from direct talks lately as a result of theinstability of the government it represents.''   The Iraqi statement said negotiations cannot move past basiccease-fire arrangements without action on two of the Baghdadgovernment's demands: free navigation in the Persian Gulf andU.N.-supervised clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which formsthe southern frontier.   The waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the gulf, has been blockedby sunken ships and silt since the early weeks of the war, whichbegan in September 1980.   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati repeated theIranian position that those issues were ``extraneous elements'' andcould be addressed later.   Velayati said negotiations have been hung up the agendadisagreement since they began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-firetook effect. He said Iran's priority is withdrawal of militaryforces to internationally recognized boundaries.   Iraq said Iran was giving a false picture and that Baghdad hadstated its position in two letters to U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar before the talks began, ``so the raising of thesetwo issues is neither extraneous nor new.''   The statement said Iran was procrastinating and Velayati should``get down to business.''   Direct talks occurred only on the first two days in Geneva andneither Velayati nor the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, hasmet with U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson since last Saturday. Perez deCuellar was mediator when the talks began, but put Eliasson incharge Sept. 1.   Signs increased Friday that the talks will recess and resumelater this month in New York.   U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said continuing low-level,indirect contacts were focusing on ``how to proceed'' and Eliasson,a Swedish diplomat, probably would hold a news conference Saturdayor Sunday.   Sources close to the talks said privately he was expected toannounce a recess but there still was disagreement over a date forresumption.</TEXT></DOC>
