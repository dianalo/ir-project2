At a House oversight hearing yesterday, SEC officials disclosed that Mr. Boesky's sales of securities from his investment funds were far greater than the previously reported $440 million, but they wouldn't provide a precise figure.    The disclosure came as lawmakers questioned SEC Chairman John Shad and other officials about their decision to permit large-scale liquidations before the market learned Nov. 14 of the arbitrager's $100 million settlement.    &quot;We were very concerned that if it wasn't handled with discretion, it could have a drastic effect on the market,&quot; Mr. Shad told lawmakers.    Although SEC officials wouldn't specify when the sales began, Mr. Shad previously has said they started in early September. The Boesky funds had &quot;initial aggregate&quot; securities positions of $2.2 billion, SEC officials said yesterday. Those holdings were offset by $2.36 billion in liabilities, including margin debts of $1.1 billion, $660 million in debentures and $600 million in stock loans.    By Nov. 14, the officials said, Mr. Boesky had drastically reduced the liabilities to $938 million by selling securities, drawing cash from other sources and cutting back on stock loans. At that point, margin debt stood at $233 million and stock loans at $45 million.    Most of the stock loans were so-called matched-book transactions in which Boesky partnerships borrowed stock from institutional investors and then lent the stock to brokerage firms, making a profit on the difference in loan rates, according to Richard Ketchum, the SEC's director of market regulation.    The debentures still are outstanding, the officials said. They were underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. last spring when Mr. Boesky was raising money for his main arbitrage fund, Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co., a limited partnership.    The SEC won't say whether the stock sales were part of Mr. Boesky's agreement to pay a $50 million penalty and give up $50 million in illicit profits made on tips from Dennis Levine, formerly an investment banker at Drexel. But the agency clearly acquiesced to Mr. Boesky's moves to reduce the margin debt and other obligations of his highly leveraged partnerships. It isn't known when Mr. Boesky agreed to cooperate with the SEC's investigation.    The stock sales weren't for his &quot;personal benefit, but for the benefit of the limited partners and debenture holders,&quot; Mr. Ketchum told lawmakers.    As reported, one Boesky fund sold at least $440 million in securities, liquidating large positions in several stocks, in the week before the settlement announcement to reduce the margin debt of funds Mr. Boesky managed.    That burst of selling provoked a storm of protest from professional traders and lawmakers, who contended that Mr. Boesky was given an unfair -- and possibly illegal -- edge over other market participants. Yesterday, under sharp questioning by Michigan Democrat John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, SEC officials insisted that the sale of securities was lawful and was preferable to throwing the market into turmoil.    The agency had feared that news of the Boesky scandal would prompt a flurry of margin calls from brokers demanding full payment for stock bought by Mr. Boesky's funds on margin, or credit. That would have forced Mr. Boesky to unload the stock, depressing the market and triggering more margin calls.    &quot;It could have been uncontrolled selling on a down market, which would have had a snowballing effect,&quot; Mr. Shad told lawmakers.    The repercussions of the announcement, which was made on a Friday, proved to be fleeting. &quot;By the end of the (next) week, the market had bounced back, and the market has gone on to a new all-time high,&quot; Mr. Shad said. &quot;He (Mr. Boesky) lost money, on average, by selling when he did.&quot;    At yesterday's hearing, Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, defended the settlement with Mr. Boesky, asserting that the agency &quot;didn't get short-changed&quot; in taking stock in two Boesky concerns, rather than cash, to cover the penalty.    On Nov. 14, he said, the stock value exceeded $50 million. Moreover, he said he received telephone calls from bidders for Mr. Boesky's Cambrian andamp; General Securities PLC stock as soon as he returned from the news conference on the settlement.    Mr. Lynch and Rep. Thomas Luken (D., Ohio) clashed over whether the SEC let Mr. Boesky off too lightly. Mr. Lynch said the SEC &quot;could be litigating with him three years from now,&quot; but decided to gain his cooperation instead to curb trading abuses on Wall Street. </TEXT></DOC>
