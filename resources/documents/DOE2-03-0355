Time to peak contrast(TPC) and time constant of thewashout exponential curve(T) were measured in 14 patients with stableeffort angina pectoris and critical one vessel lesion before and afterpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty(PTCA). All patients hadnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (59 +- 7 %) and Tl/sup 201/myocardial image at rest. The values of TPC and T were significantlyshortened from 5.4 +- 1.3 to 4.5 +- 1.0 sec (p andless; 0.02) and from 10.9+- 3.8 to 5.3 +- 1.3 sec(p andless; 0.001) after PTCA, respectively. However,in 9 of all patients TPC after PTCA showed approximately the same valuedas those before PTCA. In 5 experimental dogs with critical circumflexstenosis, coronary flow(CF;Doppler flow meter) and systolic thickningof the posterior wall(by sonomicrometry) at rest were not different fromcontrol, however, contrast media-induced reactive hyperemia was markedlyattenuated, accompanied with a significant of T (7.7 +- 4.5 vs 15.8 +-10.9 sec, p andless; 0.01) and completely unchanged TPC (both 6.8 sec). Withsimultaneous tracing of CF and time-density curve, TPC and washout phasecorresponded with contrast-induced transient CF reduction and hyperemicphase, respectively. We conclude that T might be more sensitive for estimationof CF is maintained almost normal, such as patients with stable effortangina pectoris having normal left ventricular wall motion at rest.</TEXT></DOC>
