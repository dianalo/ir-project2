These would, in turn, result in a worldwide rise of about 0.8 metersin sea level by the year 2100. This sea level change, increased temperature,and chemical changes in seawater composition produced by increased CO/sub2/ levels could affect the production of near-shore marine communities.Temperature increase and pH decrease lead to decreased growth rates andskeletal chemical changes in coralline algae and have been documentedin experimental microcosms. These environmental responses, coupled withthe projected rate of sea level rise, potentially could lead to a decreasein vertical carbonate accretion of coralgal reefs in the Hawaiian archipelagoand throughout the world. Carbonate sand production would be altered,resulting in changes in the supply of sand for beaches and the potentialdrowning of some shoal-water areas. There is a strong need for more documentationof the response of shoal-water, benthic marine communities to environmentalstress induced by the release of CO/sub 2/ and of trace gases to theatmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
