The report followed the resignation Monday of Sune Sandstrom,head of the secret service since 1987. He said the government hadlost confidence in him and apparently wanted a more political manin the job, rather than ``only a policeman.''   The secret service came under sharp attack after the 1986assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme because some securityofficials took part in a private hunt for a suspect.   The new 215-page report urged tighter supervision of the secretservice and greater documentation of its work.   It was compiled over six months by Carl Lidbom, Sweden'sambassador to France, and submitted to the government today. Thegovernment ordered the report independently of the Palme scandalwhen the agency came under criticism for keeping political filesand other issues.   Lidbom confirmed that the Sakerhetspolis, or SAPO as theSecurity Police are known, kept files on political opinions ofcivil servants and citizens. In most cases, the practice is barredby the constitution.   The ambassador also said SAPO may have used illegal wiretaps insome of its anti-terrorist and counterespionage operations.   ``Seemingly, it has been characteristic for SAPO to conduct itswork in a gray zone between the legal and illegal, the ethical andunethical,'' the report said.   The disclosure of irregularities in the private operation tofind Palme's killer shadowed the government of Prime MinisterIngvar Carlsson for most of last year.   Several SAPO officers were enlisted in a private investigation.They were uncovered smuggling eavesdropping equipment into thecountry.   The scandal led to the resignations of a national police chiefand a justice minister.   A 42-year-old man suspected in Palme's killing was arrested Dec.14. Officials have said the trial of the suspect, ChristerPettersson, will start May 29. Pettersson has denied he shot Palme.   At a news conference today, Lidbom recommended that Sandstom'sreplacement ``have broader experience'' and not necessarily comefrom the ranks of the national police.   He also said the agency should be required to gain priorapproval for wiretapping from the justice chancellor or anotheroversight body.   Lidbom, a senior member of the governing Social DemocraticParty, was a controversial choice to investigate the secretservice, since he was sharply critical of SAPO in the past.   He said SAPO had followed the lead of other countries'intelligence agencies in working in secret. He did not name theother nations.   ``It has become the practice to leave as few tracks aspossible,'' he said of the agency's working methods.</TEXT></DOC>
