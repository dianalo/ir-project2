The ruling came over the objections of a foundation formed by the late Conrad N. Hilton, Barron Hilton's father.    The appeals court, reversing a 1986 probate court decision, ruled that Mr. Hilton has the option of buying 6.8 million shares, or about 27% of Hilton Hotels' stock outstanding, from his father's estate. The stake originally had been bequeathed, with certain restrictions, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, a charitable organization that chiefly benefits Catholic nuns, upon the hotel magnate's death in 1979.    The appeals court didn't rule on the terms under which the stake would be purchased, a major point of contention in the nine-year legal battle. Mr. Hilton claims that his father's will allows him to buy the stake for its 1979 value of about $24 a share, or about $165 million. The appeals court yesterday, however, remanded the case to the probate court to rule on price and other terms of the sale.    The stock of the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based hotel and casino concern closed at $91.50, up 25 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At that price, the disputed stake's current market value is about $620.8 million.    The 66-page decision did outline several possible methods for valuing the shares, including one that would call for Mr. Hilton to pay a substantial premium for the stake over his proposed price. But the three-judge panel said that &quot;always in mind should be the decedent's intent to cause his son (Barron) Hilton to pay a reasonable and fair price that (Barron) Hilton can find economically feasible, while at the same time not depriving the Foundation of an unreasonable value in the residue.&quot;    Donald H. Hubbs, president of the Hilton foundation, said officials of the charity hadn't fully reviewed the decision and couldn't elaborate. Based on his brief reading, Mr. Hubbs said, the ruling &quot;would certainly be appealed.&quot;    Mr. Hilton currently holds about 4% of Hilton Hotels' approximately 25 million shares outstanding. In a statement, he said he was pleased by the court's decision. &quot;It validates the position I have taken since my father's death,&quot; he said.    It was unclear whether the two sides still might attempt to negotiate a settlement, rather than continue the protracted court battle. Last week, Leroy A. Judge Jr., a Hilton Hotels vice president and assistant to Mr. Hilton, had said it was likely that the case would be settled out of court. At that time, however, he stressed that he wasn't speaking for Mr. Hilton and that the company wasn't a party to the litigation.    Yesterday, Mr. Judge said the company couldn't speculate about whether the parties would settle. Ronald E. Gother, a lawyer representing Mr. Hilton, said the appeals court had admonished the parties to make a good-faith attempt to resolve the value issue. &quot;It's our intention to make that effort,&quot; Mr. Gother said. </TEXT></DOC>
