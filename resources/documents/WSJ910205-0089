Koch</HL><DATE>02/05/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A22</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   Why is the newly introduced Civil Rights Bill still aquota bill?   Because, like the 1990 version known as Kennedy-Hawkins,the legislation finds that an unlawful employment practice isestablished when &quot;a complaining party demonstrates that anemployment practice (or group of practices) results in adisparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sexor national origin, and the respondent fails to demonstratethat such practice is required by business necessity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The employer would have the burden of proving that thehiring practice or group of practices bear a &quot;significantrelationship to successful performance of the job.&quot; Contraryto the claims of the legislation's supporters, this standardis more stringent than the standard consistently applied inthis area by the Supreme Court. The court says that employersmay justify hiring practices if they bear a &quot;manifestrelationship to the employment in question.&quot;   Under the Supreme Court test, employers can justify manyhiring practices as bearing a &quot;manifest relationship&quot; to theemployment. Under the bill's proposed test, it is unlikelythat employers would be able to prove that a challenged jobrequirement bears a &quot;significant relationship&quot; to&quot;successful&quot; job performance. To avoid potential liabilityunder such a murky standard, employers would, of necessity,resort to quota hiring.   Cases under the disparate-impact standard have focused onracial and gender discrimination. But under the bill,disparate impact will be so easy to prove that it will beapplied to alleged religious discrimination, and employerswill react defensively to the threat of such lawsuits.   Proponents of the bill note that some Jewishorganizations, traditionally opposed to quotas, endorse thelegislation. I suggest that Jewish organizations haven'talerted their memberships to the fact that under such a lawemployers probably will have to justify why there are moreJews on a percentage-basis in a particular job than in theapplicant job pool.   To defend themselves from suits, employers would have tojustify the disparate impact. Surely that would mean keepingstatistics on the number of Jews, Catholics, Protestants,Muslims, etc. It might even mean keeping track of all thesubdivisions -- such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh DayAdventists; Sunni and Shiite Muslims; Orthodox, Conservativeand Reform Jews -- as well.   The proposed law would particularly create a misplacedincentive for governments and universities to hire on thebasis of race, color, religion, gender or national origin.They would feel intense pressure to select thelesser-qualified individual of a group not adequatelyrepresented from a statistical standpoint -- both to avoidthe &quot;disparate impact&quot; and exposure to costly lawsuits theywould be likely to lose, as well as to avoid student unrest,picket lines and adverse publicity. They will hire thestatistically correct. (In New York City, those who wouldsuffer disproportionately would be white Jewish males.)   Few employers, would be likely to want to run the risk ofcostly lawsuits, attorneys' fees and massive back-pay awards.The mere filing of a lawsuit could hurt sales and publicacceptance of the company's product.   Nationwide, the percentage of blacks is 12%; Hispanicsabout 8%; Asians about 2%. Among whites, those who are Jewishwould still suffer the most because they are only 2% of thepopulation.   Many who support this bill deny they support quotas, butacknowledge supporting affirmative-action programs requiringgoals, timetables and sanctions; they claim that theseprograms do not entail preferences and reversediscrimination. But goals and timetables quickly become defacto quotas when employers face sanctions if they don'tachieve them, and when the burden of proof falls upon theemployer to justify hiring practices.   It is not &quot;immoral&quot; to be for quotas, nor is it &quot;immoral&quot;to oppose them. New York Mayor David Dinkins publiclysupports quotas, as do many other New York City leaders; theythink the benefits outweigh the costs. But there is much moreto be said in support of the position that this bill wouldcreate reverse discrimination and would be bad for America asa whole.   During November's election campaign, many editorialsaround the country denounced Sen. Jesse Helms's ad depictinga white worker losing his job as a result of quotapreferences. What if his opponent, Harvey Gantt, had run anad that showed two black hands and commentary saying, &quot;Is itunfair for us to be given preferential treatment to catch upfrom the burden of slavery?&quot; Would that ad have beendenounced? I doubt it.   Will the supporters of this bill attack those of us whooppose it as racists because we honestly believe that it willfoster quotas? Unfairly, they will probably do so again thisyear, as they did last year. False charges of racism are therefuge of those who cannot argue on the merits.   Civil-rights groups have been seeking a fig-leafcompromise with some opponents of the bill to facilitate anoverride of any presidential veto. Their latest ploy has beento approach some big businesses with a new offer. Thesecivil-rights groups are hoping that if the damages availableunder the bill for intentional discrimination are reduced,the businesses will agree to language that, while ostensibly&quot;solving&quot; the quota problem, does not do so. But so long asthis bill encourages quotas, and it does, it should not beacceptable no matter what compromise is offered.   ---   Mr. Koch, former mayor of New York, writes a weekly columnfor the New York Post and is in private legal practice.</TEXT></DOC>
