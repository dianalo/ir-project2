The OPEC regular general meetingwas over without making new effective measures for stabilizing the internationalpetroleum market. A significant decline in the market occurred in theearly spring, 1988. It is estimated that there is a large possibilitythat the oil price will temporarily fall below 15 dollars. The reasonlies in that the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran which hassupported the 18 dollar new fixed price system has began to break, resultingin the loose control of OPEC for the system, and the production reductionagreement is hardly kept. It is likely that the price-reduction salewill be spread. However, there is a large possibility that OPEC, facingthis severe crisis, will strongly bind themselves together, so that the18 dollar fixed price system will be maintained. In brief, it seems thatthe international petroleum market is very similar to that in 1985 beforethe severe fall in oil price. (8 figs, 11 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
