And we're making very clear to the coupplotters and the coup people that there will not be normalrelations with the United States as long as this illegal coupremains in effect.'&quot; Coup plotters and coup people? Mr. Bush,get a grip.</LP><TEXT>   Americans are unsophisticated because we are spoken to asif we all came from the backwoods. Consequently, we expectnews (and TV) to be scaled down to our ignorant level, whichin turn prompts the public officials and the news media (andTV producers) to give us our news (and TV shows) in ascaled-down version that we ignorant folk can understand.It's a vicious circle.   Perhaps if the American public demanded a higher qualityof news presentation (and TV shows), we would receive them.   But as it is, we hear such language from our president ascoup plotters and coup people when he is referring to one ofthe most momentous events to occur in the U.S.S.R. since1917, which is: A coup d'etat by hard-line Communists whotried to overthrow the increasingly democratized Sovietgovernment.   Perhaps I should have said &quot;America, get a grip.&quot;   Amalia Davison   South Bend, Ind.</TEXT></DOC>
