The prime minister said he briefed Bush on his talks with theleaders of the Angolan and Mozambique governments. Cavaco Silvasaid he had ``expressed the hope that if all interested partiesshow a positive attitude, it will be possible to put an end to theconflict that exacts such a heavy toll on the peoples in those twoAfrican countries.   Bush called Portugal ``a close and enduring ally'' and saidtheir talks had been productive. The prime minister said he wanteda ``broader and deeper relationship'' with the United States.   The impasse in talks between the Soviet-backed governmentsupported by Portugal and the UNITA rebels armed by the UnitedStates had been expected to be a significant part of discussionsbetween Bush and Cavaco Silva.   A senior Portuguese diplomat flew to Angola last week fordiscussions with the president of the former Portuguese colony,Eduardo Jose dos Santos, in advance of Cavaco Silva's Washingtontrip.   The Portuguese leader, who arrived in Washington on Wednesday,is bringing Bush ``lots of information'' about the situation thereand Angola's views, said an aide to the prime minister.   A truce between the Angolan government and UNITA broke down lastsummer and efforts since then to hold peace talks have failed,despite intense U.S. lobbying. On Tuesday, the State Departmentchastised the Soviet Union for supporting a Angolan governmentoffensive against UNITA that began Dec. 23.   ``We welcome an active Portuguese involvement'' in bringing thetwo sides together, said a senior administration official whobriefed reporters about Cavaco Silva's visit. He spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Despite differences over U.S. support for UNITA, the Union forthe Total Independence of Angola, led by Jonas Savimbi, theofficial stressed both countries are now eager to seek peace in theAfrican nation.   Cavaco Silva's aide, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,said the prime minister also hoped to reassure Bush that theeconomic integration of the 12-nation European Economic Communityby 1992 will not exclude American products and services.   Cavaco Silva's visit is meant to highlight the rapid growth ofU.S. investment in Portugal, which doubled to more than $1 billionfrom 1988 to 1989, the American official said. An agreement oninvestment is to be signed Thursday.   Also on the agenda was a preliminary discussion on renewing theU.S. rights for use of Portugal's Lajes air force base in theAzores Islands. The eight-year agreement expires next year and theofficial predicted prospects for renewal are ``pretty good.''   Lajes is a strategic refueling depot for U.S. military aircraftand is also used to track Soviet submarine activity in the Atlantic.   Bush and Cavaco Silva were also to focus on the role of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization in light of the changes inEastern Europe and Soviet disarmament proposals. Portugal is anactive member of the 16-nation Atlantic alliance.   Cavaco Silva was to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheneylater in the day. On the agenda was a U.S. program to modernize thePortuguese armed forces.   The U.S. official said some of the modernization will be fundedby the annual military aid appropriated by Congress for Portugal.The assistance for this year is $100 million and will probablydecline slightly next year in light of budget constraints, theofficial said.</TEXT></DOC>
