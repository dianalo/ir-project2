(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Folk singer Pete Seeger and New York Cityactivist Al Sharpton were sentenced to 15 days in jail Friday ondisorderly conduct charges stemming from a racially chargeddemonstration over an alleged rape.   Albany Police Court Judge Thomas Keegan also found 10 othersguilty of disorderly conduct for disrupting traffic during an April4 demonstration near the state Capitol in Albany. The protestersclaim racism in the investigation of a claim by Tawana Brawley, ablack Wappingers Falls teen-ager, that she was abducted and rapedby six white men last November.   Two defendants were acquitted after the three-day, non-jurytrial. One of those acquitted, Rodney Stewart, had tears runningdown his face as he said he wanted to join the others as they weretaken directly to jail.   As he was led out of court, Sharpton, a minister who also is thesubject of state and federal investigations into his financialdealings, raised his fist and shouted, ``Tell Cuomo to straightenthis out!''   Sharpton and two other Brawley advisers, New York City lawyersAlton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, have accused New York Gov.Mario Cuomo of racism because he appointed the state attorneygeneral, rather than a prosecutor of their choosing, to look intothe Brawley case.   A handful of demonstrators in court briefly chanted ``Nojustice, no peace'' following the sentencing.   The defendants, who all got 15 days in jail, were led away tobegin serving their sentences immediately at the Albany County Jail.   Maddox, who represented all the defendants except Seeger, calledthe decision a ``political hit.''   ``It's clear the Constitution does not apply to Al Sharpton,Pete Seeger and any other people who support the elimination ofracism and discrimination and particularly those who support TawanaBrawley,'' Maddox said.   Maddox said after the sentencing he was searching for a judgethat he could ask to grant bail Friday evening pending appeal ofthe demonstrators' convictions.   Maddox had argued that the defendants were exercising theirconstitutional right to free speech in the demonstration.   Assistant Albany County District Attorney Steven Doughertyfocused his case on whether the demonstrators ignored repeatedwarnings by police to disperse when they tried to block traffic. Hesaid the demonstrators could have gotten off with fines if they hadnot insisted on a trial.   State Attorney General Robert Abrams has said his inquiry willprobably end without the arrest of any suspects because MissBrawley and her family will not cooperate, on the advice ofSharpton, Mason and Maddox.</TEXT></DOC>
