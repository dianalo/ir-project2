<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-0034 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new imaging system for the dental field that combines recent advancesin both the electronics and computer technologies was developed. Thisnew imaging system is a computed panoramic tomography process based onthe newly developed laser-scan system. In this study a quantitative imageevaluation was performed comparing anatomical landmark in computed panoramictomography at a low exposure (LPT) and in conventional panoramic tomographyat a routin (CPT), and the following results were obtained: 1. The diagnosticvalue of the CPT decreased with decreasing exposure, paticularly withregard to the normal anatomical landmarks of such microstructural partsas the periodontal space, lamina dura and the enamel-dentin border. 2.The LPT was highly diagnostic value for all normal anatomical landmark,averaging about twice as valuable diagnostically as CPT. 3. The visuallydiagnostic value of the periodontal space, lamina dura, enamel-dentinborder and the anatomical morphology of the teeth on the LPT beeing slightlydependent on the spatial frequency enhancement rank. 4. The LPT formedimages with almost the same range of density as the CPT. 5. Computedpanoramic tomographs taken at a low exposure revealed more informationof the trabecular bone pattern on the image than conventional panoramictomographs taken under routine condition in the visual spatial frequencyrange (0.1 - 5.0 cycle/mm).
