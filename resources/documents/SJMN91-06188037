The Serbian men who remain are out of sightand heavily armed, preparing for what they believe will be a bloodletting thatwill decide whether Croatia's 600,000 ethnic Serbs will remain part ofCroatia.;    &quot;Only the bravest or the completely mad are still here,&quot; said aSerbian woman who sat crocheting in the park, her gun hidden but handy. &quot;Ihave a gun, and I will shoot it. In two minutes, you all are dead.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SERBIANS IN CROATIA AWAITING BLOOD BATH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related article this page  </MEMO><TEXT>     While international attention has focused on the battles betweenindependence fighters in neighboring Slovenia and federal troops, thisrepublic's ethnic tangle may eventually explode into an even deadlier and moreintractable conflict. If attempting to secede from Yugoslavia has beendifficult for Slovenia, which is ethnically homogenous, it could be muchharder for this ethnically mixed republic of 4.5 million.;    Forty-one peoplealready have been killed in Croatia since May, many in clashes between Serbianguerrilla squads and Croat-controlled police, and the violence has onlyintensified since late last month when Croatia declared its intention tosecede from Yugoslavia.;    The Serbs and the Croats, Yugoslavia's two largestethnic groups, long have been at odds. The Serbs of Croatia have declaredthemselves independent of Croatian rule and have vowed to fight the republic'sindependence. Many of Croatia's Serbian enclaves now resemble armed camps.;   In Glina, 35 miles from the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the streets aredeserted, cafes closed, and house windows shuttered, despite the Balkan heat.The Croatian police also wait, in a station yard littered with grenades androckets. Federal troops sit in seven T-72 tanks in the central park of thistown of 7,500 people.;    &quot;We expect 2,000 dead here,&quot; said Dragan Roksandic,a Serbian politician in Glina. Roksandic, a well-spoken, well-dressed lawyer,moves through the empty midday streets with a revolver tucked into his belt.His bodyguard wears a pistol and a hunting knife.;    &quot;We are heading backinto feudal times,&quot; said the local army commander.;    In Yugoslavia,Croatians are outnumbered 2 to 1 by the Serbs, who have dominated the countrysince its founding in 1918. The newly elected Serbian President SlobodanMilosevic is hostile to the idea of an independent Croatia and has threatenedto go to war against Croatia to protect the Serbs living in the republic.;    A high price?;  Many observers believe Milosevic has encouraged the armedrebellion of the Serbs in Croatia as a means of showing Croatia thatindependence from Yugoslavia will come at a high price. It is widely believedthat the Croatian Serbs receive some help from members of theSerbian-dominated officer corps of the Yugoslav army.;    The differencesbetween Serbs and Croats are political, cultural and religious. They reachback before the first and second world wars, back before the time thatNapoleon's men planted linden trees in Glina's central park. They are rootedin the centuries-old line that divided Byzantine, Ottoman-ruled Serbia fromCatholic Croatia, which was ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire.;    InGlina, there is also a monument to more recent cause for mistrust. It is awhite sculpture that marks where more than 1,200 Serbs were herded into achurch in 1941 and murdered by the fascist Ustasha regime, Croatia's war-timerulers who traded Nazi allegiance for the hope of an independent Croatianstate.;     Attacks on police;  Last week, Serbian forces laid siege to thepolice station in Glina. Four people were killed, including two civilians, and10 were wounded. The Serbs say 21 police were taken hostage, including the newpolice chief. A few days later, the police station was attacked again. Severalpolice were wounded. The Serbian townspeople say the Croat police later gunneddown an unarmed Serbian in front of his house.;    On Monday, a Croat mayorand deputy and a Serbian council member were gunned down. They were trying tomediate a cease-fire in a village in eastern Croatia. The suspect is a Croatwhose house had been bombed by Serbs the night before and reportedly was in nomood for mediation.;    The official line of the Croatian government is thatall disturbances in Croatia have been instigated by outsiders, radical Serbswho cross into Croatia from neighboring Serbia bearing weapons, encouraged bythe hard-line Milosevic.;    On Friday in Zagreb, Croatian Defense MinisterSime Dodan said &quot;95 percent&quot; of Serbs in Croatia were loyal. He denounced&quot;Serbian imperialists&quot; for provoking a war between Serbia and Croatia anddeclared that the main aim of the Yugoslav national army was to &quot;maintainSerbian hegemony&quot; in Yugoslavia.;    But in Glina, asked how many local Serbs-- three quarters of the town population -- were involved in the paramilitaryorganization, Roksandic said simply: &quot;All.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY BATTIATA, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Glina, Yugoslavia  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910706  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  810  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 6, 199100188037,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
