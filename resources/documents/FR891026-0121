Notice of receipt of the petition was published on September 1, 1989, andan opportunity afforded for comment (54 FR 36406). The make and type of passenger car for which exemption was requested isthe Morgan open car, or convertible. The British manufacturer of the Morganhas not offered its vehicle for sale in the United States since the earlydays of the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. In recent years, however,Isis Imports has bought a small number of incomplete Morgan cars from theBritish manufacturer, and imported and sold them in the United States.They differ from their British counterparts, not only in equipment itemsand modifications necessary for compliance with the Federal motor vehiclesafety standards, but also in their engines, which are propane fueled.Isis imports as motor vehicle equipment the individual components of theMorgan other than the engine, assembles them in the United States, addsthe propane engine, and as the assembler of the vehicle, certifies itsconformance to all applicable Federal safety and bumper standards. Thishas been a long-standing practice, and acceptable to NHTSA. In contrastto this is the practice of concern to NHTSA (see 54 FR 17775) in whichall parts necessary to the vehicle, including its engine, are importedseparately as motor vehicle equipment for subsequent assembly, in an attemptto avoid importation bond and NHTSA compliance procedures applicable tofully assembled nonconforming motor vehicles. The vehicle assembled byIsis in the U.S. is deemed sufficiently different from the one producedby Morgan in Britain that Isis may be regarded as its manufacturer, notits converter, even though the brand names are the same. Isis assembled 11 Morgans for sale in the U S. in the 12-month period precedingthe filing of its petition. It argued that compliance with the passiverestraint requirements of Standard No. 208 would cause it substantial economichardship, and that it had in good faith attempted to comply with the standard.It asked for a 3-year exemption from the requirements, during which timeit would continue to provide protection through its current three-pointlap-shoulder belt system The passive restraint requirements became effective September 1, 1989,for 100% of passenger car production, through a 3-year phase-in periodduring which convertibles such as petitioner's car, were exempted fromcompliance. On March 30, 1987, the agency published a notice announcingthat it had reexamined the question of automatic restraint requirementsfor convertibles, and that it had concluded that it was reasonable andpracticable for convertibles to meet these requirements as of September1, 1989 (52 FR 10122). Two comments for reconsideration of the requirementwere filed, one by Isis. It commented that the necessary automatic restraintcomponents would not be available through its normal commercial channelsuntil a considerable period of time after the major manufacturers' vehicleswere equipped with automatic restraints. The agency denied these petitionson April 27, 1988 (53 FR 15067), on the basis that insufficient evidencehad been submitted to show that automatic restraint systems could not beinstalled in vehicles that were not originally equipped with such systems.The denial was published approximately 16 months before the effective dateof September 1, 1989. In the months following the denial and preceding its petition, Isis pursuedseveral avenues of compliance, discussed in greater detail in its petition.Its initial interest was acquisition of an air bag system, but it foundinsufficient information available in the U.S. as to whether Chrysler Corporation'ssystem would be suitable for its car. Because NHTSA's notice of denialhad mentioned the automatic restraint system in Alfa Romeo convertiblesas a viable and practicable method of compliance. Morgan on behalf of Isiscontacted Autoliv. ``U.K. agents for the Electrolux 2-point motorized beltsystem used in the Alfa.'' Although Autoliv submitted a proposal for installationof the Alfa system, it expressed reservations about the space availablefor its installation and the maintenance of rail form and reliability withvehicle movement over uneven surfaces. Morgan had also contacted the MotorIndustry Research Association (MIRA), which submitted a proposal late inMarch 1989, for development of an airbag system. In July 1989 the developmentcosts of such a system were judged too high to be feasible, and MIRA'sefforts then turned towards an automatic belt restraint system. Isis believesit can financially meet the MIRA development costs spread over a 3-yearperiod, whereas a more immediate compliance (18 months) through the Autolivsystem could not be amortized through a retail price increase in a volumeof 11 cars without creating substantial financial hardship. Petitionerhad a net loss exceeding $63,000 in 1988, and a cumulative net loss exceeding$60,000 for its last four tax years. New car sales generate 90% of the petitioner's income, so that a denialof the petition would force it ``to cease doing business''. Sales of spareparts and service would be inadequate to fund development of a passiverestraint system without new car sales. Isis argued that an exemption wouldbe in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of the NationalTraffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, because its vehicles contribute tothe alternative fuel industry. Continued availability of the Morgan wouldhelp to maintain the existing diversity of motor vehicles in the UnitedStates. The small number of vehicles likely to be covered by the exemption,and the limited use that is made of them as second or third vehicles, wouldhave an immaterial effect upon motor vehicle safety in Isis's opinion.No comments were received on the petition. It is apparent from the Isis petition that the slender volume of vehiclesit imports and sells afford it only a marginal existence under the bestof circumstances, and have not, at least in recent years, provided it witha profit. Its petition indicates that installation of the Autoliv systemis not immediately practicable for its design, and would involve some reengineeringof the basic car. Its preference is for an airbag system, and it is proceedingin this direction over the next 3 years. Thus it is manifest that to requireit to comply with the passive restraint requirements recently applicableto it would cause it substantial economic hardship, and that it has, ingood faith, in the months since the denial of its petition for reconsideration,attempted to comply with the standard. NHTSA also is able to find thatan exemption is in the public interest. The addition to the vehicles ofa propane-fueled engine is consistent with efforts within the Administrationto promote alternate fuels, even if the volume is not significant. An exemptionis also consistent with the objectives of the Vehicle Safety Act; if thepresent rate of importation is maintained, less than three dozen vehicleswill be manufactured under the exemption. Further, they will be equippedwith a restraint system that complied with Standard No. 208 before September1. In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that the petitionerhas met its burden of persuasion that compliance would cause it substantialeconomic hardship, and that it has, in good faith, attempted to complywith Standard No. 208. It is further found that an exemption would be inthe public interest and consistent with the objectives of the Vehicle SafetyAct. Accordingly, Isis Imports is granted NHTSA Temporary Exemption 89-4,expiring October 1, 1992, from sections S4.1.2.1 and S4.1.2.2 of 49 CFR571.208 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 <T3>Occupant Restraint Systems.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">(15 U.S C. 1410; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: October 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey R.
