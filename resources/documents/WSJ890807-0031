Nothing, say lots of analysts and stock market traders. They figure the slump is simply the economy's glide path down to a soft landing and investors are enjoying the ride.    But there's a minority of economists who monitor the stock market who are becoming convinced that if the economy isn't already in a recession, it isn't very far away.    To these pessimists, there's something wrong with the premise that the economy can keep sinking while stock prices keep rising. Several months ago, when the soft landing thesis -- moderate economic growth with declining inflation and lower interest rates -- first emerged, some of these economists conceded that a soft landing was possible, even though they thought it wasn't very probable.    Now they are convinced the soft landing was merely wishful thinking, and a recession is imminent. &quot;All the classic signs are there,&quot; warns A. Gary Shilling, an economist and partner in Thematic Investment Partners. &quot;The run-up in interest rates slowed the growth of housing and auto sales, which in turn slowed employment growth, which in turn has made consumers cautious. All that is leaving retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers with inventories they don't want, setting the stage for a big recessionary decline.&quot;    These economic bears see the latest evidence of slowdown in last week's economic reports. Although the economy overall created some 169,000 jobs in July, the manufacturing sector of the economy added a scant 3,000 jobs. And earlier in the week the National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey hit a six-year low. That was enough to push Bostian Research Associates' macro-economic index well into negative territory, which is supposed to signal that a recession is imminent.    &quot;In the past, when the index has signaled a recession, the economy has managed to struggle higher for an average of five months before a recession started,&quot; says David Bostian, president of the firm. &quot;But with the very volatile world we live in, the recession could come a lot sooner than five months,&quot; he says.    To be sure, there are plenty of economists who think the soft landing is still on track. Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, says that past recessions have been preceded by persistent Fed credit tightening that drove up interest rates. Past recessions &quot;weren't accidents; they were engineered to remedy severe inflation problems,&quot; he says. This time it's different. &quot;The Fed already has eased three times. If the Fed is easing before the economy goes negative, the risk of a big recession is small.&quot;    Skeptics might ask the doomsayers why stock prices don't reflect the recessionary threat. The easy answer, the pessimists say, is that many investors are still betting on the soft landing. Investors haven't seen enough evidence yet that corporations are cutting back on production to be convinced that a recession is under way. And they like the fact that merger and buy-out activity continues to demonstrate that companies are willing to pay premiums above current prices for corporate assets.    But James Solloway, an economic bear at Argus Research, suggests that stock prices do reflect recession worries. He says the traditional measures of stock prices -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index -- are merely the average of a variety of stock prices. But if the stock market is viewed as two distinct markets -- one cyclical and the other defensive -- there's clear evidence that investors are bracing for a recession.    &quot;The action has been in the defensive stocks like food, utilities and beverages,&quot; he says. These stocks tend to fare well in economic declines. &quot;The traditional industrial stocks, such as steels, chemicals and papers, haven't done that well.&quot; These so-called cyclical stocks are sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy.    While the two-tiered stock market indicates some recession anxiety, Mr. Solloway thinks that investors still haven't fully discounted the effects of a recession he believes is at hand. &quot;The fact that the stock market is trading at about 13 times earnings is some indication that investors are discounting a decline in profits,&quot; he says. &quot;But that doesn't mean that prices can't move lower from this point. It just isn't going to be the kind of bloodbath that we saw in October 1987.&quot;    Maybe. But Wall Street's bears don't agree themselves about how severe the downturn will be and how far stocks will drop. Mr. Solloway's predictions of modest declines are predicated on a mild recession. But Mr. Shilling is worried that there will be nothing at all mild about the recession he thinks is developing. Not only does he predict that it will be deep and long, but that it will be world-wide.    &quot;Even though some people think Europe and Japan will continue to hold up the U.S. economy, those countries are going through the same cycle, only a little later than us,&quot; says Mr. Shilling. &quot;We're saying the whole world will be in recession by the first half of next year.&quot;    Mr. Bostian, too, is very bearish. His concern is that the prevalence of tactical asset allocation -- computer-driven switches among stocks, bonds and cash -- and volatile program trading could bring about a startlingly swift decline in stock prices. &quot;Who knows what the cause will be, maybe some political or foreign event?&quot; he says. &quot;But you give the market a little jolt, and you could get one of those futures-driven meltdowns.&quot;    In line with his grim outlook, Mr. Bostian is recommending to his pension-fund clients that they hold only 10% of their portfolios in stocks, while keeping 40% in high-quality bonds and 50% in cash. And he figures he will soon recommend that conservative investors get out of stocks altogether.    &quot;People say, 'Why rush? Stocks can go higher?',&quot; he says. &quot;But I tell them to remember how they felt in October 1987. The time to get rid of stocks is before that happens, not afterward.&quot;    Obviously, the majority of investors don't buy the bears' doomsday scenario. Right after the 1987 crash, there were widespread warnings that the nation was headed for a deep recession. Investors who ignored those predictions and stayed in stocks have been amply rewarded.    However, some bears like Mr. Shilling aren't recommending that investors dump all stocks, albeit he is counseling caution. Right now, he says, the best shares to own are high-yielding stocks that act much like bonds, such as telephone and some electric utilities and some regional banks. Later, after the recession is clearly under way and interest rates are tumbling, some growth stocks could perform well, he says. What not to hold: Cyclical stocks and heavily leveraged issues.    Mr. Shilling also recommends high-quality bonds and intermediate-term notes on the assumption that interest rates will plunge as the Federal Reserve attempts to restimulate an ailing economy. &quot;The Fed is already easing, but when it becomes evident the economy is in trouble, they'll be virtually throwing money out of airplanes,&quot; says Mr. Shilling.    Because Mr. Solloway of Argus Research is predicting only a relatively mild recession, he finds it more difficult to come up with recommendations for investors. He doesn't think investors should risk buying depressed cyclical stocks right now, yet the traditional defensive stocks that everyone wants to own are expensive, he believes. While bonds look safe, Mr. Solloway doesn't anticipate a big enough drop in interest rates for bonds to provide much in the way of capital gains.    &quot;We're at the point of a dilemma,&quot; he says. &quot;You can take stocks like PepsiCo, Coke, and Philip Morris because they all seem to have good-looking earnings patterns that will hold up in a recession. But there isn't anywhere you can go at this point to get spectacular total returns on your money.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The July employment report thundered through the stock market, causing broad selling of defensive stocks and aggressive bidding for cyclical shares.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.16 to 2653.45, with the big defensive issues, such as Procter andamp; Gamble and Merck among the decliners. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.82 to 343.92, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite index fell 0.45 to 191.64. Big Board volume was 169,750,000 shares compared with 168,690,000 Thursday. Decliners outpaced advancers, 867 to 642.    For the week, the Dow industrials added 18.21 points, while the Sandamp;P 500 added 1.77. The New York Stock Exchange composite gained 1.26.    After taking a look at July employment data, investors concluded that the U.S. economy is stronger than expected. U.S. employment growth in July eased slightly less than projected, with new non-farm payrolls up 169,000; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.2% of the work force in July from June's 5.3%. June employment data were revised upward to an increase of 250,000 jobs.    The employment report -- which suggests the economy is stronger than many investors believed -- diminished expectations of further interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and supported the case for continued economic growth.    This resulted in an accelerated rotation Friday by many investors out of defensive stocks -- which perform well in a recession -- and into cyclical stocks, which move up and down with the economy. This rotation began early last week.    Earlier this summer, investors fearing a recession bought drug, food and utility shares that retain earnings ability in an economic downturn. But they stampeded out of those issues Friday.    Philip Morris fell 1 5/8 to 162, Merck tumbled 1 to 73 1/2, Gerber fell 2 1/8 to 96 7/8, Coca-Cola Co. tumbled 1 1/4 to 65 7/8, Procter andamp; Gamble dropped 3 3/8 to 116, Quaker Oats fell 1 1/4 to 64 5/8 and Campbell Soup fell 1 3/4 to 53 1/4.    Money flowing out of defensive shares ran into cyclicals. Dow Chemical rose 1 1/4 to 93, International Business Machines gained 1 3/4 to 115 1/2, Motorola rose 1 5/8 to 59 and Compaq Computer gained 3 3/8 to 94 7/8.    If recession fears do abate, cyclical stocks have room for a 5% to 7% gain before they catch up with the broader market, said John L. Manley Jr., portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. That could provide the market with the leadership it lacked all last week.    Another reaction to the July jobs report was an abrupt rise in the dollar. Foreign exchange traders expect U.S. interest rates to remain high compared with foreign economies. That in turn brought in a lot of Japanese buying Friday, traders said, which is expected to continue this week.    The employment data hurt bank stocks. A slower decline in interest rates will keep the cost of funds high for banks. Citicorp lost 7/8 to 32 1/8, Manufacturers Hanover fell 1 to 40 3/8, Bankers Trust slipped 3/4 to 54 3/4 and BankAmerica fell 5/8 to 31.    Brokerage stocks traded on heavy volume and slipped slightly. Salomon Brothers traded at more than three times its average daily volume, slipping 3/8 to 26 on 1,417,200 shares. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. crossed two large block trades of Salomon.    Merrill Lynch fell 1/4 to 35 3/8, PaineWebber Group slipped 3/8 to 22 5/8, and Bear Stearns eased 1/4 to 17 1/2.    UAL, the parent of United Airlines, ended down 9 1/2 to 164 1/2, a plunge of 17 1/2 for the week. There was talk in the market that regulators will take a harder look at airline mergers in the future, following the buy-out of Northwest Airlines.    Walt Disney dropped 4 7/8 to 116 1/8 after gaining 6 3/8 Thursday. The drop was attributed to profit-taking following its recent strength.    Prime Computer gained 1 1/8 to 17 3/4, as some investors decided anew that the company will be taken over. J.H. Whitney andamp; Co. said it wants to lower its bid for Prime to $20 a share from $21.50. Thursday, Whitney said it was doubtful it could get financing for the bid at $21.50 a share.    Federal Express lost 5/8 to 50 1/8. The Wall Street Journal reported pilots are unhappy with the handling of the air freight concern's merger with Tiger International.    Orion Capital surged 2 3/4 to 25 3/4. The company reported second-quarter operating net of $1.07 a share, compared with net income of 44 cents a year ago.    Atlantic Richfield rose 3 to 101 1/8. The company's Arco Alaska unit said testing of one of its Alaskan wells indicates it may recover about 300 million barrels of oil from the area.    Crane added another 3/4 to 30 1/2, after rising 1 5/8 Thursday. Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette added the company to its recommended list. The stock was added to Shearson Lehman Hutton's recommended list Thursday.    Time slid 2 1/2 to 141 after Chris-Craft Industries' BHC Inc. unit elected to require Warner Communications and Time to distribute all of the BHC shares held by Warner to shareholders of Time Warner following the merger of the two media giants. Warner rose 1/8 to 67.    Mylan Laboratories gained 1 to 10 1/2. The Wall Street Journal reported that the company's 50-50 joint venture with Bolar Pharmaceutical, Somerset Pharmaceuticals, owns the U.S. rights to a drug that may help treat Parkinson's disease.    The American Stock Exchange Index eased 0.72 to 376.10.    Bolar Pharmaceutical plunged 4 3/4 to 23. The company's stock was halted Thursday after congressional investigators accused the company of submitting brand-name drugs as its own in testing for generic-drug marketing approval. The company has denied the allegations.    (See related story: &quot;Credit Markets: Economy's Vigor Spooks Bond Market...&quot; -- WSJ Aug. 9, 1989) </TEXT></DOC>
