In its analysis of the bilateral trade pact's effect on the Canadian economy, the economic research concern said GDP will increase by $9.3 billion over 10 years. It said net employment will increase by 150,000 during the period, inflation will fall slightly and the value of the Canadian dollar will be unchanged.    &quot;The free trade agreement can benefit Canada through higher living standards and more secure access&quot; to the U.S., the Conference Board said, but &quot;Canadians are going to have to work very hard to reap potential benefits of the agreement.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
