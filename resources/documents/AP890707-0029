I can't quote you a figure,'' Toni Simonetti, aspokeswoman for General Motors Corp., said Thursday shortly afterthe government announcement.   But many companies, including General Motors, have beensubstituting other materials for asbestos in products such as brakepads and linings for several years. Consumers, therefore, havealready paid the price for the change.   ``We have known that we should be eliminating asbestos fromvarious parts of our products,'' said Fred Bowditch, vice presidentfor technical affairs at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Associationof the United States.   The industry official also said he did not believe the switch tosubstitute material would be considerably more expensive.   In the face of widespread criticism, the Environmental ProtectionAgency ordered a ban on asbestos used in a range of items fromautomobile brake parts to roof shingles. The prohibition is to bephased in over the next seven years.   The ban will reduce the number of asbestos-related cancer deathsby at least 200, the EPA said.   The ban, however, does not affect existing asbestos-containingproducts. EPA officials expressed concerns that replacing thehazardous material might be more dangerous than a phase-out.   The agency first listed asbestos, a natural product that has astrength 10 times of steel but can be woven like cotton, as ahazardous air pollutant in 1972 and urged it to be banned in 1979.   ``The first question I had was why has this thing been around solong,'' said EPA administrator William Reilly in announcing the ban.Critics have charged that the Reagan administration preventedearlier EPA action on asbestos.   Nevertheless, use of the material has declined significantly. In1987, 85,000 metric tons of asbestos was used for a wide array ofproducts, down from the 240,000 metric tons used in 1984.   Asbestos has been linked with various forms of cancer, includinglung cancer.   Auto makers have been phasing out asbestos for use in brake padsand linings, and many said Thursday that the EPA decision came as nosurprise.   ``A company-wide program to remove asbestos from our disc brakepads, drum brake linings and other components began in the early1980s. Since that time, considerable progress has been made,'' saidVictor H. Sussman, an official at the Ford Motor Co.   Ford is aiming for a total phase-out of asbestos in its NorthAmerican passenger cars by 1993 for 1994 models.   General Motors, meanwhile, produces front disc brakes that arealmost all asbestos-free. However, 75 percent of the company's carsand half of its small trucks have rear drum brakes with asbestospads and liners.   Under the ban, the use of asbestos in some products, includingroofing material, pipe wrap and sheet products will be prohibitednext year. Use in brake pads and linings will be banned in 1993, andits use in auto replacement parts, cement water distribution pipes,roof shingles and a variety of other products will end in 1996.   The agency estimates that the cost to consumers for the phase-outwill be about $460 million over the next 13 years.   Among the substitute products are kevlar, a synthetic fabric usedwith resin, and some types of metallic fiber, industry officialssaid. One manufacturer, who requested anonymity, said he prefers thesubstitute.   ``Most of us would rather sell metallic pads, anyway. They costmore,'' he said.   The ban does not cover guided missile liners, acetylene cylindersand some sealing tapes. The EPA said it was difficult to findadequate substitutes and the hazards involved were minimal.</TEXT></DOC>
