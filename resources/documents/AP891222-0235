ATandamp;T Computer Systems announced Thursday it had won the``networked computing contract,'' which will provide computerhardware, software, training and maintenance for FAA and othergovernment transportation offices.   Initial value of the three-year contract is $18.8 million, butboth government and company officials said it could reach $853million with five one-year options to install a network ofcomputers in all department regional, branch and local offices.   The department now uses ``a hodgepodge'' of 56 brands ofmicrocomputers, several incompatable software programs and avariety of local area computer networks, said FAA spokesman JohnLeyden. He said the new contract covers desk, laptop and othercomputers in a network for administrative offices and is not partof plans to upgrade FAA air traffic control operations.   Leyden said it was the biggest contract FAA has awarded. He saidabout $534 million worth of equipment and work would be for FAAoffices and the rest for other Transportation offices.   The system to be installed is called OATS, for Office AutomationTechnology and Service.   ``We believe this is one of the largest desktop officeautomation contracts ever awarded, '' said Gordon J. Bridge,president of ATandamp;T Computer Systems. He said it represents a majormilestone in ATandamp;T's computer company, which is six years old.   He said the new system will save the government money byincreasing productivity with state-of-the-art computers andsoftware.</TEXT></DOC>
