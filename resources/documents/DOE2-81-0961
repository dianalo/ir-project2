The optimal pH region of aminoorthanilic-azo-chromotropicacid interaction with Be 5-6.5; the optimal wavelength is 640 nm. Thesolution colour changes from violet-red to blue during complex formation.Selectivity increases after addition of masking substances. Be determinationon the background of 4-fold Cu and VO/sup 2+/ amounts 8-fold Al amounts,2-fold Zn amounts is possible in the presence of 5-fold EDTA amountsunsubstituted reagent is characterized by the lowest degree of contrastand selectivity of reactions with metals.</TEXT></DOC>
