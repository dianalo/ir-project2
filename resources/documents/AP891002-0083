The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeeringconvictions of family bosses Anthony Salerno, Anthony Corallo andCarmine Persico, high-ranking mobsters Salvatore Santoro,Christopher Furnari and Gennaro Langella, and mob members AnthonyIndelicato and Ralph Scopo.   The racketeering convictions stemmed, in part, from the plottingof Galante's July 12, 1979 murder at a Brooklyn restaurant. Alsogunned down were Leonard Coppola and Giuseppe Turano.   Federal prosecutors say there are five distinct Mafia groups inNew York City _ the Genovese, Gambino, Colombo, Lucchese andBonanno ``families.''   Prosecutors say Corallo was boss of the Lucchese family, whichSantoro served as ``underboss'' and Furnari as ``consigliere.''Persico led the Colombo family and Langella served as his underboss.   Salerno was boss of the Genovese family; Persico boss of theColombo family and Langella its underboss.   Scopo, a member of the Colombo family, was also president of theDistrict Council of Cement and Concrete Workers, LaborersInternational Union.   Indelicato, a Bonanno family ``soldier'' promoted after theGalante killings, was the only defendant accused of participatingin them.   Evidence at the eight men's 11-week jury trial indicated thatthe activities of Mafia families throughout the nation arecoordinated by a ``commission'' which each family boss serves as amember.   Through the 1970s, the Bonanno family was not representeddirectly on the commission because of internal disputes. Galantewas the Bonanno family boss, and prosecutors said the commissionordered his murder as a means of resolving the disputes.   Each of the defendants was convicted of conspiracy in violationof the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO).   All the defendants except Indelicato received 100-year prisonsentences. He was sentenced to 40 years but that term was reducedto 20 years on appeal.   Except for overturning part of Indelicato's conviction, the 2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the RICO conspiracyconvictions last Jan. 31.   In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the Mafia figuresargued, among other things, that prosecutors failed to prove asufficient connection between the Galante murder and the commission.   The cases are Indelicato vs. U.S., 88-1881; Salerno vs. U.S.,88-2060; Persico vs. U.S., 88-2061; Scopo vs. U.S., 88-2071.</TEXT></DOC>
