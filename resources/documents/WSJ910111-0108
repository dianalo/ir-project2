The company at the end of this year will be a smallerentity focused on property and asset management rather thandevelopment. It will have fewer far-flung offices and astructure more closely resembling a traditional corporationthan Crow's signature amalgamation of independentpartnerships.</LP><TEXT>   The reorganization includes a consolidation of thecompany's management and a removal of the compensationincentives that encouraged partners to develop new realestate projects, sometimes to the point of market saturation.It also means Joel Peterson, one of the company's co-managingpartners, will step aside.   Once the nation's pre-eminent builder, the company expectsto start less than $500 million of new construction thisyear, less than a quarter of the $2.2 billion in newconstruction begun in 1985 and less than half of the $1.3billion in construction starts in 1989, the most recentfigures available. And the company hopes to push its feerevenue, including revenue from managing property owned byothers, to $160 million this year from $137.3 million in1989. In 1980, Trammell Crow booked just $20 million in feerevenue.   In the heady days of speculative real estate investment,the company was known for its unusual corporate culture, apartnership in which all partners were expected to generatebig deals and all partners, even founder Trammell Crow andtop management, drew small salaries and worked mostly forequity participations in their projects. In the coming year,however, the company will be transformed into a moretraditional corporate entity.   &quot;For us, in our culture, these are major changes,&quot; said J.McDonald &quot;Don&quot; Williams, who will serve as the sole chiefexecutive officer of the Crow company. The changes don'taffect the operations of Trammell Crow Residential, aseparate operation with headquarters in Atlanta, or the Crowfamily interests, which include hotels and retail trademarts.   Mr. Williams previously shared managing partner dutieswith Mr. Peterson, who is based in the company's Foster City,Calif., office. Mr. Peterson will continue to serve on thecompany's board and work on strategic planning but won't beinvolved in the overall management of the company, Mr.Williams said.   The company's chief financial officer, Robert Whitman,also is stepping aside, Mr. Williams said. Mr. Whitman willcontinue as managing partner of Trammell Crow Ventures, aproperty acquisition unit of the Crow company.   Messrs. Whitman and Williams devoted much of the past twoyears to refinancing Crow's massive, but undisclosed, debtand negotiating with lenders that were threatening toforeclose on troubled properties. In its largest refinancingto date, Crow got $456 million from Equitable Real EstateInvestment Management Inc. to pay off the debt on 90 of itsproperties and reduce debt on 60 more.   The company, with much of its portfolio near its Dallashome, was hit hard by the real estate downturn in theSouthwest, but the spreading real estate recession took itstoll on Crow properties across the country. The company'scurrent assets are valued at no more than $14 billion, downsignificantly from the company's glory days.   In addition to acquisitions through its ventures unit, thecompany will be putting more emphasis on its corporateservices unit, which was formed last year to pursue realestate management contracts with national companies, and onthe newly formed Trammell Crow Capital unit, which willhandle asset management and portfolio management for Crowproperties and third-party properties.   Crow's shift from its traditional development business is&quot;prudent and realistic,&quot; said Richard Kateley, president andchief executive officer of the Chicago-based Real EstateResearch Corp. &quot;It seems not only a sane but a safe strategyto be out of the development business.&quot; Mr. Kateley addedthat the changes don't signal that Crow is out of thedevelopment business for good. &quot;They're just standing on thesidelines,&quot; he said.   Mr. Kateley did caution that the transition from Crow'straditional entrepreneurial, deal-based business won't beeasy. &quot;It's not just a matter of changing methods ofcompensation,&quot; he said. &quot;You need different kinds of people.&quot;   The immediate response of Crow's 170 partners wasn'tknown. They were attending the annual partners' meeting inDallas at the Loew's Anatole Hotel tower, one of TrammellCrow's favorite projects and the target of a foreclosureproceeding by the lender.   The lender, the Texas Teachers Retirement System, declinedto comment on the proceeding, but Mr. Whitman saidnegotiations are continuing and the tower isn't expected tobe foreclosed.</TEXT></DOC>
