The regulations revise current regulations on removal of careerappointees from the SES during the probationary period and for less thanfully successful executive performance, as well as placement rights followingremoval. They also add provisions on removal and placement of career appointeesas a result of reduction in force. In addition, the regulations cover theremoval of noncareer and limited SES appointees, and reemployed annuitantsholding any type of SES appointment. Note that disciplinary removals ofcareer SES appointees who have completed the SES probationary period arecovered in 5 CFR Part 752, Subpart F.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Neal Harwood, (202) 632-4486.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 10, 1988, OPM published proposedregulations (53 FR 30061) on removal from the SES and guaranteed placementfor certain employees following removal. The comment period, which was60 days from the date of publication, ended on October 11, 1988. Commentswere received from nine agencies and one executive organization. Commentsare summarized below, along with any changes in, or clarifications of,the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Career Appointees During Probation (Part 359, Subpart D)</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 359.402(b) stated the basis for action to remove a probationerfor unacceptable performance.One agency requested that typical causes or situations where removal actionis appropriate be included. While we do not believe it would be usefulto list typical causes or situations, since those will be specific to theindividual probationer, we can point out that removal can be based on eitherunacceptable managerial or technical performance. It should be kept inmind that the probationary period is the final step in the examining processfor initial career appointment to the SES. It allows the agency an opportunityto assess the new appointee's actual performance in an executive positionand to remove the appointee without due formality should circumstanceswarrant.The proposed regulations stated that removal ``may, but need not, be basedupon a final unsatisfactory rating under the agency's SES performance appraisalsystem.'' This language has been clarified to indicate that removal maytake place at any time during the probationary period and is not dependentupon a formal rating under the agency's performance appraisal system.If removal is based on a formal rating, however, the rating must followall the requirements of the performance appraisal system, including anopportunity for a higher level review and review and recommendation bythe Performance Review Board. One agency asked whether removal could bebased on a formal rating above unsatisfactory. The answer is yes. Evenif a formal rating would not be a basis for removal of an individual whohas completed the probationary period (e.g., a single minimally satisfactoryrating), that does not prevent the removal of a probationary employee.If removal is based on a formal rating, the removal still takes place underandSection; 359.402 and not under Subpart E of Part 359, which covers performanceremoval of individuals who have completed the probationary period.Proposed andSection; 359.404(b)(2) stated that a probationary employee hadto be given a reasonable time to reply to a notice of proposed removalbased on conditions arising before appointment. An agency asked that thenumber of days be specified. We have not specified the number of days becausethe number could be dependent on how close the employee is to completingthe probationary period. It should also be noted that there is no specificresponse time provided under andSection; 315.805(b) for removal of probationersoutside the SES for conditions arising before appointment.As an exception to the normal moratorium on removal actions during the120 days following the appointment of a new agency head or a new noncareersupervisor, proposed andSection; 359.406 permitted an agency to proceed witha removal under certain emergency conditions. These conditions were similarto those provided in Part 752, Subpart F, which covers adverse actionsagainst SES career appointees who have completed probation. The way inwhich the conditions were stated in andSection; 359.406, however, differedsomewhat from the way they were stated in Part 752. In the final regulationsat andSection; 359.406(c)(4), the conditions are not the same, so that aprobationer can be removed when retention may pose a threat to the appointeeor others, may result in loss of or damage to Government property, or mayotherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests.<ITAG tagnum="85">Removal of Career Appointees for Less Than Fully Successful ExecutivePerformance (Part 359, Subpart E)</ITAG>Under current andSection; 359.501(d), a career appointee must be removedfrom the SES after two annual summary ratings of unsatisfactory withinfive consecutive years or two annual summary ratings of less than fullysuccessful (unsatisfactory or minimally satisfactory) within three consecutiveyears. 5 U.S.C. 4314(b)(1)(D) provides that an appraisal period ``may beterminated in any case in which the agency making an appraisal determinesthat an adequate basis exists on which to appraise and rate the seniorexecutive's performance.'' Proposed andSection; 359.501(d) dropped the term``annual'' ratings from the regulations to make clear that ratings basedon a shortened appraisal period were still to be considered final ratingsfor removal purposes.The executive organization stated, ``If these proposed regulations areenacted allowing both ratings to be less than annual ratings, then theresult could be that two periods of less than satisfactory employment coveringninety days each in a five year period would result in the removal of anemployee from the SES.'' The organization recommended that at least oneof the two ratings must be an ``annual rating'' and cover a one-year period.We have retained the provision as stated in the proposed regulations. Itis in accord with the law, and we believe there are advantages to bothagencies and employees with this provision over the current regulations.If an agency was dissatisfied with an employee's performance and wantedto take some action before the end of the appraisal year, it might be willingto give an unsatisfactory or minimally satisfactory rating and allow theemployee to stay in the SES provided that the agency could remove the employeebefore the end of a full year if the employee's performance did not improve.However, if the agency knew it would have to wait a full year before givinganother rating that could result in removal, it might just give an unsatisfactoryrating initially and remove the employee immediately without giving theemployee a further chance. (Under 5 U.S.C. 4314(b)(3), a career appointeemay be removed after a single unsatisfactory rating.)It should be noted that any shortened appraisal period must meet the minimumappraisal period established in the agency's SES performance appraisalplan. The rating must also meet all other requirements of law and regulation,including opportunity for review by a higher-level executive and reviewand recommendation by the Performance Review Board. Further, if an employeereceives a less than fully successful rating, the agency is required under5 CFR 430.304(h) to assist the employee in improving performance beforethe next rating of record is given. We believe these provisions provideadequate safeguards for affected employees, and we will note them in theFederal Personnel Manual instructions.One agency asked that OPM clarify in andSection; 359.502(b) the role of theMerit Systems Protection Board in holding informal hearings following performanceremovals. This is not appropriate for these regulations, since MSPB hasits own regulations on informal hearings (see 5 CFR 1201.141 and 1201.142).We will provide in the Federal Personnel Manual, however, further informationon the hearing process.Proposed andSection; 359.503 covered the 120-day moratorium on the removalof a career SES member for performance following the appointment of a newagency head or the member's most immediate supervisor who was a noncareerappointee and had the authority to remove the member. One agency recommendedthat the definition of a ``noncareer appointee'' in andSection; 359.503(b)be revised to include an appointee who is traditionally changed upon achange in Administration or a change in the agency head. We have not adoptedthis recommendation since such an appointee in most instances will be oneof the noncareer appointees already listed in the section (e.g., a Presidentialappointee or a noncareer SES appointee), but could be an SES or other careerappointee, who would not be subject to the statutory moratorium in anyevent.One agency recommended that proposed andSection; 359.504 be revised to incorporatefrom andSection; 359.505(b) of the current regulations the statement thatan employee may submit a complaint to the Special Counsel of the MeritSystems Protection Board if an agency violates the 120-day moratorium onperformance removals following the appointment of a new agency head ornoncareer supervisor. An employee has such a right under 5 U.S.C. 1206since any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice may be submittedto the Special Counsel. We deleted the provision from the regulations becausewe do not want to give the impression that an individual has a right tosubmit a complaint to the Special Counsel only when the right is specificallystated in the regulations.Note that the 120-day moratorium applies to all performance removal actionsunless the removal is based on an unsatisfactory performance rating issuedbefore the appointment of the new agency head or noncareer supervisor.<ITAG tagnum="85">Removal of Career Appointees as a Result of Reduction in Force (Part359, Subpart F)</ITAG>The executive organization recommended that probationary employees shouldbe given a separate, lower retention standing than employees who have completedthe probationary period during RIF competition and that employees who havecompleted the probationary period and have a fully successful rating orhigher should be placed first in available positions if they are affectedby a RIF. The organization stated, ``The whole purpose of a RIF is to retainthe most experienced, highly qualified within government.''Under 5 U.S.C. 3595(a), the competitive procedures in a RIF in the SESmust be based primarily on performance, not on length of experience. Therefore,we do not believe the regulations should require that agencies give allprobationary employees a lower retention standing than employees who havecompleted the probationary period, irrespective of the performance of theemployees. We have revised andSection; 359.602(a), however, to provide thatif a probationary employee and an employee who has completed the probationaryperiod have the same retention standing, the employee who has completedthe probationary period must be retained over the probationary employee.For example, if employees were placed on the retention register based ontheir last SES performance rating of record and both a probationary employeeand an employee who has completed the probationary period had an outstandingrating, the latter employee would be retained over the probationary employee.We will also indicate in the Federal Personnel Manual that although theyare not required to do so, agencies in their RIF plans may place all employeeswho have completed the probationary period, and who have a rating of fullysuccessful or above, higher on the retention register than probationaryemployees.As far as placement is concerned, under 5 U.S.C. 3595(b)(3)(A), if an employeehas completed the probationary period and is affected by a RIF, the agencymust place the employee in any vacant SES position for which the employeeis qualified. There is no such requirement for a probationary employeeaffected by a RIF, although the agency may place the employee elsewherein the SES if a vacant position is available. In accordance with the recommendationof the executive organization, we have revised the regulations to statethat if both a probationary employee and an employee who has completedthe probationary period are affected by a RIF and are qualified for a vacantSES position, the employee who has completed the probationary period mustbe placed in the position since that employee has a statutory entitlementto the position while the placement of the probationary employee is optionalwith the agency.<ITAG tagnum="85">Guaranteed Placement and Saved Pay (Part 213, Section 3202; Part 359,Subpart G; Part 536, Subpart A)</ITAG>Guaranteed placement, with saved pay, at GS-15 or higher is provided underSubpart G of Part 359 for certain career employees who are removed duringtheir probationary period, removed for performance reasons following theprobationary period, or removed as the result of a reduction in force (RIF).The proposed regulations provided that a career appointee removed fromthe SES as the result of RIF was entitled to SES pay retention under Part359, section 359.705, and was not covered by the general pay retentionprovisions in Part 536. The regulations continued to permit agencies toexercise their discretionary authority in andSection; 536.104(b), however,to grant pay retention in RIF situations when the individual was not entitledto pay retention under andSection; 359.705. An agency asked for examplesof when andSection; 536.104(b) might be applicable. These include when anindividual voluntarily accepts a GS-15 position following receipt of ageneral RIF notice or a notice of position abolishment, or accepts a positionbelow GS-15 following a RIF.An agency stated that pay savings under andSection; 359.705, rather thanPart 536, should be applicable if an employee voluntarily returns to theGS-15 level after receiving notice that his or her position is being abolished,even though there is no formal RIF. The statute is clear that positionabolishment alone does not entitle an individual to guaranteed placementat GS-15 and pay savings under 5 U.S.C. 3594, but that the individual mustbe removed from the SES in a RIF action under 5 U.S.C. 3595(b) (4) or (5).(See 5 U.S.C. 3594(b)(2).) It may well be that there are other SES positionsto which the individual could be assigned, and it would not be appropriateto require that the agency provide pay savings under 5 U.S.C. 3594 if theindividual voluntarily decided to take a GS-15 position in lieu of acceptingreassignment within the SES.If an agency has no vacant position currently available at GS-15 or abovefor which the individual qualifies and cannot make a placement in anotheragency, the introductory material to the proposed regulations stated thatthe agency still must create a position to permit the fallback and shouldthen continue its efforts to find an appropriate position for the individualeither internally or in another agency. An agency stated that OPM ``shouldestablish some expressed limit on this continuing effort to avoid adverseimpact as an agency seeks to recover the equilibrium lost after a RIF inits executive ranks.''As was pointed out when the proposed regulations were issued, if it doesnot prove possible to find the individual another position following fallback,an agency can conduct a further RIF under Part 351 RIF procedures; butthis action may not be taken within three months of the removal from theSES. It was also pointed out that this is the same period provided in Part351 (5 CFR 351.701(a)) as the minimum length of time a position must lastwhen an employee is assigned to another position under RIF procedures outsidethe SES.The executive organization argued that the three-month period did not providesufficient protection to a former SES member. It was concerned that anagency might abolish a GS-15 position in which the individual was placedand conduct a RIF as soon as the period had ended, and it recommended thatthe agency be required to retain the individual in the position until anotherGS-15 or SES position could be found. It is not the intent of the law,however, that a former SES member be granted indefinite tenure at the GS-15level. There may be legitimate situations where because of budgetary orother reasons an agency finds it necessary to conduct a RIF under Part351 procedures at the GS-15 level, and it is not possible to find the formerSES appointee another GS-15 position. Therefore, the final regulationsdo not require continued placement at GS-15 should a RIF be necessary atthat level after the three months.Proposed andSection; 213.3202 established a new Schedule B appointing authorityfor those instances in which an individual entitled to guaranteed placementdoes not have reinstatement rights in the competitive service and cannotbe placed under another excepted appointing authority. An agency recommendedthat a time limit be placed on how long the individual may stay under theSchedule B appointment and permit an agency to convert the employee noncompetitivelyto a career or career-conditional appointment in the same manner that PACemployees can now be converted. In order to provide for noncompetitiveconversion to the competitive service for employees who do not have reinstatementeligibility, there must be an Executive Order, as was done for PAC employees,or legislative action. We will explore these possibilities, but in themeantime the final regulations contain the governmentwide Schedule B authoritywithout time limitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under Section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it will only affect Governmentemployees who are members of the Senior Executive Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>5 CFR Part 213Government employees.5 CFR Part 359Government employees.5 CFR Part 536Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Wages.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR Part 213, 5 CFR Part 359, and 5 CFRPart 356 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE</ITAG>1.
