EPA has defined ``substantially similar'' at 46 FR 38528 (July28, 1981). Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides that upon application by any fuelor fuel additive manufacturer the Administrator of EPA may waive the prohibitionsof section 211(f)(l) if the Administrator determines that the applicanthas established that such fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contributeto a failure of any emission control device or system (over the usefullife of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achievecompliance by the vehicle with the emissions standards to which it hasbeen certified pursuant to section 206 of the Act. If the Administratordoes not act to grant or deny a waiver within 180 days of receipt of theapplication (in this case, February 3, 1988), the statute provides thatthe waiver shall be treated as granted. The Texas Methanol Corporation submitted a waiver application for a gasoline-alcoholfuel blend, referred to as OCTAMIX, such that the resultant fuel is composedof a maximum of 3.7 percent by weight fuel oxygen, a maximum of 5 percentby volume methanol, a minimum of 2.5 percent by volume cosolvents and 42.7milligrams/liter (mg/l) of Petrolite TOLAD MFA-10 corrosion inhibitor oran appropriate concentration of other corrosion inhibitor such that thefuel will pass the National Association of Corrosion Engineers' test TM-01-72(NACE Rust Test). <T3>See</T3> 52 FR 33262, September 2, 1987. With the exceptions of theallowance for higher molecular weight alcohols (C5 through C8) in the cosolventmix, the allowance for any corrosion inhibitor which would pass the NACERust Test, and an allowance for 2 percent by volume methyl tertiary butylether (MTBE) in the base fuel (if present as a result of unintentionalcommingling during transport or storage), the application specified thatOCTAMIX would meet the same conditions specified in the waiver grantedto E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Inc., as revised on October 31,1986, at 51 FR 39800 (the DuPont blend). For reasons specified in the decision document (available as describedabove), EPA has decided to conditionally grant Texas Methanol's waiverapplication, provided the production of the gasoline-alcohol fuel is donein accordance with the requirements stipulated by Texas Methanol, withthe exception that the NACE Rust Test not be allowed as the sole criterionfor selection of an alternative corrosion inhibitor. Instead the blendwill be subject to the alternative condition specified in the waiver request,that Petrolite TOLAD MFA-10 at a concentration of 42.7 mg/l be used. Somecommenters indicated that the NACE Rust Test was not adequate in determiningthe suitability of a corrosion inhibitor. Since enough questions remainas to the adequacy of this corrosion test as the sole criterion for alternativecorrosion inhibitors, EPA has determined that this one criterion is notenough to reach a conclusion on the adequacy of a corrosion inhibitor ata given concentration. Therefore, as was the case with the DuPont blend(51 FR 39800, October 31, 1986), the Agency invites other corrosion inhibitormanufacturers to submit test data to the Agency to establish, on a case-by-casebasis, whether their formulations are acceptable as an alternative to TOLADMFA-10. This decision is based on the determination that Texas Methanol has demonstratedthat the gasoline-alcohol fuel, when used as specified in the decisiondocument, will not cause or contribute to a failure of 1975 or subsequentmodel year vehicles or engines to comply with the emission standards withrespect to which such vehicles or engines were certified under section206 of the Act. Thus, the waiver request is granted provided the followingconditions are met:(1) The final fuel consists of a maximum of 5 percent by volume methanol,a minimum of 2.5 percent by volume cosolvent in unleaded gasoline. Thecosolvents are any one or a mixture of ethanol, propanols, butanols, pentanols,hexanols, heptanols and octanols within the following constraints: theethanol, propanols and butanols or mixtures thereof must compose a minimumof 60 percent by weight of the cosolvent mix, whereas a maximum limit of40 percent by weight of the cosolvent mix is placed on the pentanols, hexanols,heptanols and octanols or mixtures thereof. Furthermore, the heptanolsand octanols are limited to a maximum 5 percent by weight of the highermolecular weight alcohol mix (pentanols, hexanols, heptanols and octanols);(2) A maximum concentration of up to 3.7 percent by weight oxygen in thefinal fuel is observed; (3) Petrolite,s proprietary corrosion inhibitor formulation, TOLAD MFA-10,is blended in the final fuel at 42.7 milligrams/liter; (4) The final fuel must meet ASTM D439-85a Standard Specifications forAutomotive Gasoline (a copy of which is in the docket), with the qualificationthat Test Method D323 for RVP be replaced by the ``dry'' test method describedin ASTM D-2 Proposal P-176, Proposed Specification for Automotive SparkIgnition Fuel, Annex A.3 or by automatic apparatus described in Annex A.4of the D-2 Proposal 176 (attached to the decision document as AppendixB); (5) The final fuel must meet the maximum temperature for phase separationas specified in ASTM D-2 Proposal P-176, Table 4 using the test methodfor water tolerance contained in Annex A.5 (attached to the decision documentas Appendix C); (6) The fuel manufacturer must take all reasonable precautions, includingidentification and description of the product on shipping manifests, toensure that the finished fuel is not used as a base gasoline to which otheroxygenated materials are added, provided, however, that up to two percentby volume of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) will be allowed in thebase stock to which the alcohols are added if the MTBE is present onlyas a result of commingling in transport and storage, not purposefully addedas an additional component to the alcohol blend; (7) Specifications for alcohol purity attached to the decision documentas Appendix D are met. EPA has determined that this action does not meet any of the criteria forclassification as a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore,no regulatory impact analysis is required. This action is not a ``rule'' as defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>because EPA has not published, and is not required topublish, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative ProcedureAct, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or any other law. Therefore, EPA has not prepareda supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of thisaction on small entities. This is a final Agency action of national applicability. Jurisdiction toreview this action lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicialreview of this action is available only by the filing of a petition forreview in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitwithin 60 days of February 8, 1988. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act,today's action may not be challenged later in separate judicial proceedingbrought by the Agency to enforce the statutory prohibitions.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">A.
