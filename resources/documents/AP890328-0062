(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A privately owned rocketship carrying experiments on weightlessness will blast off on a15-minute mission Wednesday, the nation's first licensed commercialspace flight.   The flight of Consort I, owned by Space Services Inc. ofWashington, marks another stage in the private space researchefforts that gained in significance after the 1986 Challengertragedy.   ``This launch you can probably trace to the Challenger disaster,because these experiments were hoped to be carried aboard theChallenger or future shuttles,'' said Walter Pennino, an investorand spokesman for Space Services.   The company launched the first privately financed space shot,Conestoga I, with a dummy payload in 1982. Since then, the federalgovernment has begun licensing private launches, and Consort I isthe first to get the green light.   Conestoga I proved private industry could launch spacecraft, andalso showed that the government was unprepared for the newindustry, Pennino said.   ``There was no single agency we or anyone else could go to andask if we could do this,'' Pennino said, adding his firm had toconsult with the Federal Aviation Administration, FederalCommunications Commission and Defense Department, among otheragencies.   The Department of Transportation was assigned the task oflicensing private launches and coordinating with differentagencies. Consort I received its license from the department's newOffice of Commercial Space Transportation.   Consort I's 650-pound payload will include experiments that willmeasure how liquids mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam formsand cures, how liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts inweightlessness and how finely powdered metals bond under hightemperature to produce alloys without melting.   The experiments have applications in the manufacture ofmedicines, alloys and ball bearings, and in the construction offuture space stations.   The payload was assembled by the University ofAlabama-Huntsville's Consortium for Materials Development in Space,one of 16 NASA-sponsored consortiums for the commercial developmentof space.   Consort I will be boosted into space by a modified Terrier Navyrocket; the second stage is a Black Brant rocket. The entirevehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds at liftoff.   The rocket will achieve a top speed of 5,016 mph, and in alittle less than five minutes will rise 198 miles above Earth. Itwill land about 50 miles north of the launch site.   The entire venture should cost about $2 million, including thecost of reimbursing White Sands for the use of its time andpersonnel, Pennino said.</TEXT></DOC>
