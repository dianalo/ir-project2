North and John M.Poindexter and said he expects they would be exonerated if tried.   During a photo session with visiting Turkish President KenanEvren, Reagan was asked if he favored speeding up thedeclassification of documents considered necessary for the trialsof North and Poindexter.   ``Well, I hope that we could,'' he replied.   ``I believe in the innocence of the two men and I would like tosee that established once and for all.''   The White House had said last week that it favored legalproceedings in the Iran-Contra case going forward, but said thequestion of setting a trial date is up to the judge and theprosecutors.   Reagan has refused to say whether he would grant pardons toNorth and Poindexter, former National Security Council aides oustedin November 1986 amid revelations that proceeds from secret armssales to Iran had been diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
