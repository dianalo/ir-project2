Products </HL><SO> </SO><CO> UIS </CO><DATELINE> BLUE BELL, Pa.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. said it will buy network products for its personal computers from closely held Proteon Inc., Westborough, Mass.    The purchase agreement is initially valued at $7.5 million for the next three years, a spokesman for the computer maker said.    Proteon, a maker of high-speed ring networks, which connect personal computers, was one of the first to develop such technology. International Business Machines Corp. and an industry group since have established industry standards for the technology.    Proteon was launched in 1972 as a hightechnology consulting company but began making technology products in 1983. Its investors include Sevin-Rosen Management Co., which also has backed companies such as Lotus Development Co. and Compaq Computer Corp., and Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, which has invested in Genentech Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
