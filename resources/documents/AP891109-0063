Tornadoes touched down Wednesday evening in Georgia, Alabama andMississippi, and rains continued in already flooded parts ofLouisiana,   ``If there was a Richter scale for floods, this would havetopped it,'' said Mike Yenni, president of Jefferson Parish, La. A2-year-old boy there died when he fell into a drainage canalearlier this week.   The 3-year-old and his parents were in a mobile home smashed bya tornado in Pineview, Ga., a town of 560 people.   ``The child was found under a car 200 yards from the foundationof the trailer,'' said Deputy Sheriff Dianne Roberts. ``Someonejust happened to look under it and saw the baby.'' The child's namewas unavailable.   His father, Billy West, was found lying in the road with abroken neck and was in critical condition early today, said MandyShackleford, a spokeswoman at the Medical Center of Central Georgiain Macon. The mother also was hurt.   The tornado damaged at least four other homes and caused threeadditional injuries, authorities said.   A tornado touched down near Stonewall, Miss., on Wednesdaynight, the National Weather Service said, but no details wereavailable.   Two tornadoes hit two counties in southeast Alabama on Wednesdaymorning.   In Geneva County, a woman was hurt when her mobile home wastossed into a fish pond. Her husband paddled to the trailer in hisboat to retrieve his wife and their daughter.   ``It just all happened so fast,'' Mrs. E.C. Barnes, 54, said ina telephone interview from her hospital bed. ``The trailer is stillintact. It got picked up and was dropped in the pond. I'm fine,though.''   A tornado damaged more than 40 homes and businesses in the townof Dothan.   ``This is the worst tornado I've seen in Houston County in 10years,'' said Pat Bradley of the Dothan-Houston County EmergencyManagement Agency. ``We've found some roofs that were taken sevenblocks away and dropped.''   The Red Cross opened a shelter for those left homeless orwithout power because of the storms.   About 2,000 students at Wallace College were kept in hallwaysfor an hour during the worst of the storms and then were sent home.Several found their cars floating in a flooded parking lot.   The weather service on Wednesday reported 5.6 inches of rain inMobile, 9.6 inches in Dothan, and nearly 10 inches in Florala.   More than 2,200 homes and businesses flooded after a record 17inches of rain drenched New Orleans and three surrounding parishesduring a 24-hour period that ended Tuesday night, according topreliminary estimates. The rains continued in some areas Wednesday.   Of the 1,400 homes in the Ormond Estates subdivision, 20 milesup the Mississippi River from New Orleans, 1,000 were flooded.Water was up to 2 feet deep in homes that cost from $100,000 to$500,000. Another 1,000 homes flooded in Gretna, Kenner and partsof Jefferson Parish.   Yenni said he would call for passage of a $100 million plan formajor canal improvements and two more pumping stations in the NewOrleans area, which is below sea level and relies on a network ofdrainage canals and pumps to protect neighborhoods from flooding.   ``I cannot believe this. I think I'm going to be sick. Brand newcarpet ruined, everything ruined,'' said Liz Arceneaux, whoreturned to her Ormond Estates house by boat to find 5 inches ofwater standing in the home.</TEXT></DOC>
