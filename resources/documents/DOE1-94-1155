The CLEFT process allows to fabricateseveral thin film single crystal GaAs solar cells reutilizing the sameGaAs substrate after each run. The process is based on the epitaxiallateral overgrowth of GaAs film over a photolithographically masked monocrystallinesubstrate. The preliminary results show that the morphology of the epitaxiallayers is strongly influenced by the cleaning procedure. Silane has beenutilized to obtain the required high doping level of N-type layers. TheP-type doping is performed by means of Zn using a metallorganic source.The doping level of Zn must be reduced using an appropriate dilutionsystem. 5 figs., 7 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
