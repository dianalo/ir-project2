On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the major grade of U.S. crude, settled at$19.04 a 42-gallon barrel, up 43 cents. The June contract expiredMonday and finished at $20.93, with a gain of 33 cents fromFriday's close.   Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later than July allposted gains.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale homeheating oil for delivery in June rose 0.52 of a cent to 47.50 centsa gallon after falling 1.08 cents on Monday. The June contract forunleaded gasoline rose 0.34 cent to 64.24 cents a gallon followingMonday's decline of 1.29 cents.   Analysts said crude demand was sparked by new theories about thepossible outcome of next month's meeting of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries.   The latest speculation centered on the possibility the cartelmay decide against adjusting its output ceiling and altering its$18-a-barrel benchmark price when members gather in Vienna on June5.   Previous reports have indicated various cartel members areproducing above their self-imposed output targets.   Andrew Lebow, a broker with E.D.andamp;F. Man International FuturesInc., said a comment by Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa AlSabah appeared aimed at playing down a report Monday whichsuggested Kuwait might increase production unilaterally if thecartel didn't agree to grant it a larger share of the overalloutput quota.</TEXT></DOC>
