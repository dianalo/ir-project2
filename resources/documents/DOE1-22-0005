<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0005 </DOCNO><TEXT>A positronium (Ps) beam has been constructed by transmitting monoenergetic,low energy positrons through a gas cell containing either Ar or He whichprovide an electron to form positronium. The positrons were obtainedby magnetically deflecting positrons in the straight section of the positronbeamline into a beamline which contained the gas cell and a Ps detectionchamber. The two beamlines provide the capability of switching from anexperiment which uses positrons (a study of the angular correlation ofannihilating radiation - ACAR) to one which uses Ps atoms without breakingvacuum, nor moving equipment. The authors report the characteristicsof the two beams and state that very preliminary information has beenobtained on the characteristics of the Ps beamline and on the reflectionof Ps from a LiF crystal.</TEXT></DOC>
