The Defense Ministry said the rebels, known as Contras, had firedupon Nicaraguan troops and civilians on 140 occasions since Jan. 1.   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistanceorganization said Sandinista troops fired on its forces 69 timesduring January and February.   Defense Ministry spokeswoman Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos denied theResistance allegations and said the rebel attacks were ``an openviolation of the cease-fire.''   ``We completely respect the cease-fire, but if the Contras attackwe have to defend ourselves,'' she told The Associated Press. Shesaid none of the rebel attacks was ``of great scope.''   The leftist Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels reached aprovisional cease-fire agreement in March 1988, but talks on apermanent truce to the 8-year-old civil war stalled in September.   Since June the government has extended a unilateral cease-fire ona monthly basis that has been tacitly accepted by the rebels.   An estimaed 11,000 Contra guerrillas fled to Honduras after U.S.military assistance expired in February 1988. They have drawn from$27 million in U.S. humanitarian aid that is to expire at the end ofthis month.   Col. Pasos said ``small, dispersed Contra groups that have lostsocial support and are desperate because of the scant supplies theyreceive'' were responsibile for the attacks this year.   A statement released by the Sandinista army listed what it saidwere recent cease-fire violations by the rebels. It gave thisaccount:   On Sunday rebels fired into the village of San Jose, 190 mileseast of Managua, killing three peasants, including two who belongedto a civilian militia. The day before rebels stopped a truck at LaPinnuela, 175 miles east of the capital, and robbed the peopleaboard the vehicle.   On March 1, two people were killed when about 40 rebels fired ona small boat carrying passengers on the Escondido River near SaltoHamaca, 195 miles east of Managua.   The Nicaraguan Resistance report accusing the Sandinistas ofcease-fire violations said that on Feb. 20 Rafael Ramos Herrera, arebel officer known as Commander Nelson, was killed in an ambush bygovernment troops in Zelaya province.   ``All of these Sandinista attacks that constitute a frankviolation of the cease-fire declared by the Nicaraguan regime havebeen denounced to the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
