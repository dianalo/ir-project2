As with all dynalinks, it stays in suspendedanimation until an application is loaded that needs the library services.andM;As it happens, the user shell is the first program loaded by the operatingsystem, and version 1.1 and later of the shell make calls to the dynalink PMlibraries.andM;Therefore, a lot goes on when OS/2 boots up, including the loading of the PM.andO;This is why it takes so long for OS/2 to boot: A lot of software has to beloaded into RAM.andM;PM's initial menu screen also does not look at all like Windows' MS-DOSexecutive screen.andP;  For those of you who love to issue OS/2 commands and missthe good old ''C:andgt;'' prompt, you can still have your cake and eat it, too.andO;By selecting the CMD.EXE file name from your root directory (or wherever youdecide to keep it), you can invoke a secondary OS/2 command processor andquickly get a ''C:andgt;'' prompt to issue OS/2 commands.andP;  You might even want tokeep a screen group at the ready with such a prompt for old time's sake or asa convenient way to run OS/2 commands.andM;Four potential types of applications are recognized by the OS/2 PM.andP;  First isthe DOS-mode application.andP;  This application runs in its own screen group,independent of anything happening in protected mode, and it uses the entirescreen surface.andP;  As we have said before, any DOS application is suspendedwhen you switch into the protected mode.andM;A second type of application is called ''non-windowable.'' This is aprotected mode application that also needs its own screen group and requiresthe entire screen surface.andP;  This application needs a whole screen because itrequires direct access to the screen buffer, video memory and otherresources, which means it can't share the screen with anyone.andM;A third type is called a ''VIO'' (for video input/output) application.andP;  Ithas been written to run in character windows, and is easy to recognize.andP;  Itdoesn't have any menu bars, graphics (other than simple line-charactergraphics), dialogue boxes or scroll bars.andP;  It isn't as nasty asnon-windowable applications because it doesn't access video memory directly.andM;A final series of applications is the fully Presentation Manager-readyapplication.andP;  These applications have all the accoutrements, including thescroll bars, dialogue boxes, pull-down menus and graphics images that theothers lack.andP;  They have been written to the full PM programming interface,and can share the screen real estate with each other without causing pain andsuffering to another application.andM;Ultimately, all your applications will have the full PM style, but, in themeantime, you will have to put up with managing the various different typesof PM applications.andM;Extended EditionandM;Extended Edition (EE) is almost as much of a jump from Standard Edition (SE)as OS/2 was from DOS.andP;  IBM has packed loads of functions into EE.andP;  Perhapsthe two most important groups are the ability to organize databases and touse a variety of communications links.andM;OS/2's standard editions were jointly developed by IBM and Microsoft, whichMicrosoft in turn licensed to a variety of PC manufacturers such as ZenithData Systems and Compaq Computer Corp. However, EE is IBM's domain alone.andM;The EE is IBM's first step toward a unified Systems Application Architecture(SAA), a collection of protocols and interfaces that allow programs to run ona variety of operating systems across IBM's product line of microcomputers,minicomputers and mainframes.andM;SAA-compatible products will have a similar look and feel, use the samecommunications interfaces and protocols, and require a minimum of fuss andbother to run on these different operating systems.andP;  IBM has chosen OS/2 EEas its SAA-certified operating system for the PC.andM;EE comes in two distinct versions, just like the Standard Edition: version1.0, which is a character-based application, and version 1.1 (and beyond),which uses the Presentation Manager.andM;EE is positive proof that operating systems will become increasingly moreintegrated into a user's working life, blurring the distinction between whatis considered an operating-system function and what is truly the domain of anapplications program.andP;  Let's take a closer look at these extensions.andM;Database features.andP;  OS/2 EE database manager is IBM's first try at writing PCdatabase software.andP;  What is most interesting about the product is how it isintegrated wholly into the overall fabric of the operating system itself, insuch areas as file management, communications and programming interfaces.andM;The database component uses a relational structure.andP;  In other words, data isarranged in tables of columns and rows, defined by the user.andP;  In manyrespects, it is a scaled-down version of DB2, very similar to many PCpackages such as Ashton-Tate's dBASE and Borland International Inc.'sParadox.andM;The database manager has three important components: a query manager, a setof utilities and a set of database programming interfaces.andP;  Let's look ateach of these in detail.andM;Query Manager.andP;  The Query Manager component handles the user interface, sendsqueries to the database and produces reports.andP;  There are two separate userinterfaces, one using full-screen menus and one using a command line.andM;In operation, the database bears a striking resemblance to other PCdatabases.andP;  You can add, delete and modify data, generate queries andreports, create customized views of the database, index and sort.andP;  There isnothing new about all of this, except that it is included as part of theoperating-system software, and that it is coming from IBM.andM;The maximum size of a PC database is 255 columns or 4,000 bytes, whichevercomes first.andP;  There is no limit to the number of rows, other than your localdisk storage.andP;  The entire database must reside on a single logical disk,which must be less than 32M bytes for version 1.0 of OS/2.andP;  (Version 1.1 ofOS/2 will remove this restriction, however.)andM;The 4,000-byte limit on each row is not as severe a restriction, because IBMhas included a feature similar to the dBASE ''note'' field.andP;  An entry in adatabase can reference a PC file, which can be as large as 32,000 bytes.andP;  Thefile can contain graphics, ASCII text or other data that needs a large fieldlength.andM;One twist is that the data can be located on either a PC or mainframe.andP;  Insome sense, then, OS/2 EE takes the user friendliness of dBASE or Paradox andcombines it with the power of a PC version of DB2.andM;Because this was written by IBM, the query manager includes support forStructured Query Lanaguage or SQL (pronounced ''sequel'').andP;  You can createSQL inquiries in your PC or mainframe databases, with many user help screensand prompts if you forget your field or database names or structure.andP;  Again,this compares to the features of PC/FOCUS or Paradox.andP;  IBM has designed thequery manager as part of its SAA.andP;  The architecture spells out a consistentinterface for a variety of communications protocols and other components,such as database queries and report generators.andP;  These components willeventually be used by all IBM operating environments, including OS/2 EE.andM;Database Utilities.andP;  No database program would be complete without a completeset of utilities, and OS/2 EE is no exception.andP;  IBM includes the standardfare of file-format conversion, backups and restorations, table restructuringand update-control utilities.andP;  For example, you can convert your Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet into an OS/2 EE data file, or vice versa.andP;  You can import andexport selected subsets of the entire database to a Lotus 1-2-3 file, or evenan ASCII flat file.andM;IBM's mainframe-database experience is evident when we look at the utilityfor update control.andP;  Mainframe databases have what is called a''rollback/commit'' feature.andP;  The database doesn't post any updates until alltransactions have been successfully completed.andP;  If your machine hangs up inthe middle of a transaction, OS/2 will automatically back out all data thatwas not committed and completely processed.andP;  This keeps your data integrityhigh and helps you separate out any garbled updates easily.andP;  It is a nicefeature that should be included on other PC databases.andM;Programming Interfaces.andP;  A third part of the OS/2 EE database manager is itsprogramming interfaces.andP;  Programs will be able to take control of PC datafiles and do in code what you normally do at the keyboard.andP;  Some of theseinterfaces won't be fully specified until later versions of OS/2.andM;One of the more important extensions of the database manager will be theaddition of Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) interfaces.andP;  Afuture version of OS/2 will allow APPC function calls to be directlyintegrated into the database component, so that two OS/2 EE PCs (or a PC anda mainframe) can update each other's files.andP;  Multiple applications will beable to access multiple databases concurrently, all without the knowledge ordirect keyboard control of a PC operator.andP;  This could prove to be quitepowerful, once developers catch on to this idea.andM;Direct support for SQL statements will also be added to the COBOL/2 andPascal/2 languages.andP;  This support means that programmers will be able towrite code incorporating SQL queries directly.andM;Communications Features.andP;  In addition to these database features, OS/2 EEalso folds in the functionality of several of IBM's communications programs,including the 3270 and 3101 emulation programs, IBM's APPC and the local areanetwork (LAN) operating system.andM;Because the LAN software (called the LAN Manager by Microsoft and the LANServer by IBM) is so important, we discuss it separately on Page S/48.andO;However, one point to keep in mind during our discussion on OS/2 EE is thatany LAN support, at least from IBM, is only included in OS/2 EE version 1.1and not 1.0.andM;Three different programming interfaces are supported, along with a variety ofterminal emulators and file transfer protocols.andP;  For an outline of thecomponents of IBM's OS/2 EE version 1.1, see the chart on Page S/34.andM;Programming Interfaces.andP;  There are three different programming interfacessupported by the EE: APPC, Server-Requester Programming Interface (SRPI) andan asynchronous interface.andM;APPC is IBM's strategic direction for cross-systems communications.andP;  Programswritten to this interface can run other programs without any userintervention once the programs have begun.andM;APPC has already been adopted by a variety of systems vendors, includingDigital Equipment Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and TandemComputers Inc., to name a few.andP;  This means that programmers can writesoftware that updates databases distributed on a mixed-vendor network usingthe APPC interface.andM;However, this is still far from perfect.andP;  Each vendor uses inconsistent APPCinterfaces and different subsets of the full 47 APPC command set.andM;As we mentioned earlier in the database discussion, this is the goal of IBM'sSAA.andP;  IBM currently supports APPC on its two major mainframe operatingenvironments -- Customer Information Control System (CICS) and VirtualTelecommunications Access Method (VTAM) -- on several of its minicomputers --the Series/1, System/36, System/38 and 88 -- and on PCs.andM;APPC support is limited by the type of transportation link between systems.andO;IBM currently only supports two: synchronous modems and Token-Ringconnections.andM;The type of link is called logical unit 6.2, or LU6.2.andP;  IBM's APPC is notpossible without this type of transportation, although several other vendorsoffer their own APPC implementations running over non-LU6.2 links.andM;The vast majority of corporate mainframe connections are made using regularcoaxial cables, rather than using synchronous modems.andP;  IBM calls thesecoaxial links logical unit 2, or LU2.andP;  However, there is an interface thatmarries the best features of APPC with this more popular transportationsystem -- IBM's SRPI.andP;  SRPI uses a subset of the APPC functions but issupported over coaxial-connected terminals.andM;SRPI is used by IBM's Enhanced Connectivity Facilities (ECF), a series ofmainframe and PC programs that provide services such as virtual disks andhost-database access from PCs.andM;In other words, with ECF you can store files on the mainframe as if they wereon a huge hard disk, reading and writing to the file across a communicationslink to the mainframe.andP;  ECF was first released in October 1987, and it hasquickly become a standard mechanism for providing more intelligentmicro-to-mainframe links.andM;Several of IBM's DOS-based 3270 communications programs support ECF and SRPI,so it's no surprise that OS/2 EE does as well.andP;  OS/2 EE supports SRPI over avariety of connections, including coaxial connections to 3274/3174communications controllers, and the standard APPC methods such as synchronousmodems and Token-Ring links.andM;A third interface is one IBM calls the Asynchronous Communications DeviceInterface (ACDI).andP;  This is IBM's attempt to standardize on the many differentasynchronous line connection control and line characteristics.andP;  It is hopedthat the interface will minimize the hassles of using different asynchronousmodems and serial ports when running communications programs.andM;Having these three interfaces makes it easier for both program developers andusers alike.andP;  Developers can write more powerful communications programs thatuse these interfaces.andP;  This means that we will see communications softwarethat can intelligently take control over a session, without any operatorintervention, and extract and download data, for example.andP;  Users will benefitby not having to baby-sit for each communications program and not having tolearn the idiosyncracies of matching specific communications software andhardware.andM;OS/2 EE version 1.1 adds two other interfaces to this collection: NetBIOS andIEEE 802.2.andP;  While we won't get into details here, you should know that theseare the two popular LAN programming interfaces that are supported by avariety of PC DOS networks, including existing IBM software such as the PCLAN Program and the LAN Support Program.andP;  These interfaces are important forPCs attached via LANs to IBM mainframes.andM;Future versions of EE promise additional goodies.andP;  IBM has committed torunning ECF over LU6.2 links, along with support for X.25 packet-switchednetworks and its 3270 High Level Language Application Programming Interface(HLLAPI), for example.andM;Terminal Emulators.andP;  OS/2 EE supports several popular terminal emulationprotocols.andP;  Because OS/2 is multitasking, you can run several differentsessions concurrently.andP;  However, only one asynchronous session can run,although it can run concurrently with synchronous sessions.andM;IBM supports VT100, 3101 and 3270 terminals in its first release of EE.andO;VT100 terminals are often used by DEC minicomputers and are a popular choiceas the ''lowest common denominator'' when communicating between differentsystems.andP;  IBM's 3101 protocol is for simpler ASCII terminals.andM;Both VT100 and 3101 terminal emulation types are used to connect toinformation services such as Dow Jones News/Retrieval, the Source and MCIMail.andM;A third terminal type supported by EE is for 3270 emulation, the IBMmainframe standard.andP;  Up to five or 10 3270 sessions are supported, dependingon what hardware you choose.andP;  (Synchronous modems can handle as many as 10sessions under EE, while Token-Ring and coaxial connections can handle asmany as five.)andM;Not all VT100, 3101 and 3270 functions are supported by OS/2 EE.andP;  OS/2 onlysupports full duplex operation in 3101 emulation (and only 7-bit asynchronousconnections), cannot set top and bottom margins with VT100 emulation, anddoes not support light pens, mice, or A Programming Language (APL) characterson 3270 terminal emulation.andM;Future editions of EE will support other terminals, including the 5250emulation used for IBM System/36 and S/38 minicomputers.andM;File-Transfer Protocols.andP;  OS/2 EE supports three mechanisms for filetransfer, the 3270 PC File Transfer program, XMODEM and straight ASCIItransfer.andM;IBM uses the 3270 PC program on three of its mainframe operating systems:TSO, CICS and VM.andP;  However, your corporate mainframe administrator will needto upgrade this software if you want to perform file transfers under OS/2.andM;XMODEM is a popular asynchronous file-transfer protocol used in many DOScommunications packages such as Crosstalk Communications/DCA's Crosstalk Mk.4and Relay Communications' Relay Gold.andP;  OS/2 EE supports a form of XMODEMusing 128-byte blocks to transfer files.andM;Any PC file can be transferred via XMODEM.andP;  However, OS/2 EE has a thirdmethod to transfer files via ordinary ASCII capture/send commands.andP;  Thismeans that straight ASCII text files, without any control or specialcharacters, can be transferred by this method.andP;  Typically, you would use thisto capture information from an E-mail system, or to send a print-image textfile to another computer.andP;  This straight ASCII capture is similar to what isfound on other communications products such as Crosstalk and HayesMicrocomputer Products Inc.'s Smartcom.andM;As you can see, OS/2 EE wears several communications hats: part synchronous3270 terminal, part asynchronous ASCII terminal, part LAN workstation.andM;Several of IBM's existing communications-software functions have been rolledinto the operating system, at the same time integrating the programminginterfaces and file-transfer features.andM;This raises some questions.andP;  How do you decide whether to purchase EE?andP;  Let'slook at these questions next.andM;The LAN ManagerandM;As we said earlier, the OS/2 LAN Manager represents the beginning of a newgeneration of PC-based LANs.andP;  It is also one of the more significant elementsof IBM's Extended Edition collection.andP;  (While different vendors refer to thefeatures with different names, for simplicity we have adopted the name ''LANManager,'' which is the one used by Microsoft as the generic description ofOS/2's networking software.)andM;Summary of Features.andP;  The OS/2 LAN Manager is almost a completely newproduct, and it bears almost no resemblance to its DOS progenitor, MicrosoftNetworks.andP;  In fact, they are so different, it is hard to imagine that the twoproducts can operate together over the same network.andM;Yet Microsoft and IBM have designed them this way, so that workstations (PCsthat are using files on other machines, called servers) can operate eitherwith DOS or OS/2 and still use the same network wire and share serversrunning either DOS or OS/2.andM;If you know or use IBM's PC LAN Program or other implementations of MSNetworks (such as those available from AST Research Inc., Ungermann-BassInc., NCR Comten and other system vendors), you are already halfway towardusing the LAN Manager.andP;  The syntax of many of the commands is very similar,and, in many ways, the distance between PC LAN Program and OS/2 LAN Manageris equal to the distance between DOS and OS/2.andM;There are several important differences between the old and new networks,however.andP;  Perhaps the most important issue is that the LAN Manager is a fullpartner to OS/2, rather than another software-application program as PC LANProgram was under DOS.andM;Being a full partner means that LAN Manager shares many of theapplication-programming interfaces with OS/2, along with other OS/2 featuressuch as multitasking, large RAM space, and all the pipes, queues andinterprocessing communication functions that we mentioned.andP;  There is someelegance in this design: OS/2 processes can communicate with each other amongnetworked computers, almost as they do inside the same PC.andM;The LAN Manager has, in fact, added some of its own interfaces to make thisinterprocessing communication more powerful.andP;  Almost everything that a usercan accomplish with a set of keystrokes is under program control.andP;  This makesOS/2's networking services easy to use but powerful to expand and integrateinto other applications.andM;One example of how this programming interface can be exploited is illustratedin OS/2's LAN Manager messaging features.andP;  Programs detect when errorconditions occur on the network and automatically send messages to theappropriate parties for information.andP;  The messages are standard ones thatusers can send to each other as part of the LAN Manager program, but, in thiscase, they are sent by software programs rather than actual users.andM;These changes are good news for many of you who are still suffering from thePC LAN Program.andP;  Network administration will be a lot easier with OS/2because you have one operating system running on both the workstation and theserver.andP;  Another plus is that programs will be more transportable in OS/2between a single-user and multiuser application.andM;This means that a protected-mode application written for a single-user PC cantake advantage of network services such as shared disks and printers withalmost no modification.andM;None of this was the case with DOS network applications.andP;  No matter whetheryou used Novell's NetWare or PC LAN or something else, it was all verydifferent from DOS and required a lot of careful attention to a variety ofadministrative details.andP;  DOS applications software often needed a great dealof modification to work under any network operating system as well.andM;The LAN Manager also brings new and improved functionality when compared toPC LAN Program, especially in terms of user log-in, access security,remote-program execution, printer management, status reporting and networkadministration.andP;  Let's discuss each of these in more detail.andM;The first and most noticeable difference between PC LAN Program and OS/2'snetwork services is the way that you log in to the network and access variousnetwork resources.andP;  In the old days with PC LAN, you needed to create batchfiles or use the menus to share individual resources.andP;  This was cumbersomeand difficult to administer.andM;With OS/2, the user just logs in to the server, similar to the way it is donewith NetWare or Banyan Systems Inc.'s VINES.andP;  A special log-in script,prepared by the network administrator, quickly and automatically attaches thedesired network resources, such as sharing specific subdirectories andprinters.andP;  All this is done with one log-in command.andM;The network administrator can set up as many profiles as necessary, each fora different group of users.andP;  For example, everyone in payroll can have oneprofile, while the engineers and accounts-payable departments can have otherprofiles.andP;  In our example, the payroll profile allows them to review thecorporate payroll database, while the other people are prevented from suchaccess.andM;A second area is improvements to access security.andP;  Network administrators canspecify execute-only access to files, meaning that network users can only runprograms and not copy or delete them.andP;  Previously, PC LAN had only read,write or create/delete options.andM;This execute-only option can be useful, particularly if combined with somesort of ''software checkout'' scheme on the network.andP;  The administrator canset up a software program that allows only a specified number of users to runa program simultaneously.andP;  This scheme may be required by some applicationsvendors.andP;  Thus, with this option, the limits to simultaneous access can nowbe enforced by the network administrators.andM;More Security FeaturesandM;Another security feature is that passwords are stored and transmitted inencrypted format.andP;  A network administrator can change but not view a password(if someone is forgetful, for example), similar to the many ways mainframesecurity systems work.andM;One new feature that OS/2 LAN Manager brings to the party is the ability torun programs in the server, using the server's processor and the server's RAMspace.andP;  While this is not necessarily a good idea for every network program,it can be useful in some applications, particularly with databases if youexecute the database application on the same machine in which the files arelocated.andM;Remote execution can eliminate much input/output traffic, but the trade-offis a more crowded CPU with slower execution on the server.andM;Network administrators can specify who can use this remote-execution featureand which programs users can run.andM;Another enhancement is the LAN Manager's printer-management features.andO;Printing was almost painful under PC LAN Program, and most of this has beenfixed under OS/2, although there still is some work to set up printers.andM;Printing queues can support multiple printers, so that, if one printer isbusy, a printing job can be routed automatically to another.andP;  This appliesequally well to serial and parallel printers, something that couldn't be saidabout DOS networking programs.andM;Printing jobs can also automatically wait for a specific printer, if, forexample, you want your file to be printed on legal-sized paper.andP;  Anotherfeature is the ability to install printing post-processors, which wouldenable you, for intance, to run your printing job through a PostScriptinterpreter on its way to the printer.andM;One interesting addition is that OS/2 talks to the network users.andP;  They areconstantly informed about what is going on.andM;For example, when a printing job is finished, OS/2 tells the user.andP;  If theserver's hard disk is almost full (by whatever definition you decide), thenetwork administrator is altered to this fact.andP;  As we said earlier, this isan implementation of the LAN Manager's messaging application-programminginterfaces, whereby software programs send messages directly to networkusers.andM;LAN Manager provides enhancements for displaying the status of other networkactivities, such as who logs in to what resource, what resources areavailable to a user and in general, who else is logged on.andP;  In fact, the LANManager can produce a variety of audit trails and error logs to assist indebugging tricky network problems.andM;One final feature is enhanced network administration.andP;  You can already seethat many of the aforementioned items make it easier for administering thenitty-gritty of the network.andP;  OS/2 also allows complete remote control over aserver from a workstation, with the appropriate password.andP;  This means thatyou can configure the server's hard disk, run programs, delete files -- inshort, do everything you could do at the server's keyboard.andM;If you have multiple servers on your network scattered about ingeographically hard-to-reach places (such as in several cities), this couldbe a big time saver in debugging problems.andP;  An administrator would (almost)never have to leave his or her office.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
