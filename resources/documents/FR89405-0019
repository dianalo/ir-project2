A ``framework amendment'' to the FMP (frameworkFMP) was approved by the Secretary in 1984 and established an annual regulatoryprocess setting each fishing season's management measures. The major purposes of Amendment 9 are to (1) replace the longterm spawningescapement goal and rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fall chinookwith fixed annual spawning escapement and harvest rates that will allowa fixed percentage from each brood of natural spawners to escape the fisheriesand spawn, subject to a minimum escapement floor for naturally spawningadults; (2) modify the ocean harvest allocation of coho and chinook betweennon-Indian commercial and recreational fisheries north of Cape Falcon,Oregon; (3) revise the coastwide notice procedures for inseason managementactions; (4) conform Federal and State regulations regarding the incidentalharvest of steelhead by recreational fishermen; (5) authorize inseasonreporting requirements for commercial fishermen to provide timely accountingof catches from any regulatory area subject to quota management; and (6)remove the limitations on commercial and recreational season beginningand ending dates. A notice of availability of Amendment 9 for public review and comment wasfiled with the Office of the Federal Register on December 27, 1988; waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 54 FR 49 on January 3, 1989; and was followedby a 60-day public comment period as provided under the Magnuson Act. Proposedregulations to implement five of the six amendment issues were filed withthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 17, 1989; were published at 54 FR2177 on January 19, 1989; and were followed by a 45-day public commentperiod ending on March 3, 1989. The remaining amendment issue, inseasonreporting requirements, contains a collection-of-information requirementsubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and to OMB review and approval.Proposed regulations for this issue were published separately at 54 FR11976 on March 23, 1989, with a 15-day public comment period. The preamblesto the two proposed rules discussed the rationale for the proposed amendments.The Secretary approved all measures of Amendment 9 on March 14, 1989. Thisfinal rule consolidates the implementing regulations for all six amendmentissues, although the inseason radio reporting requirements authorized bythe amendment are not effective until such time as OMB approves the collection-of-informationrequirement and a supplemental final rule is published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>announcing the OMB control number and the effectivedate for these specific regulations. Comments received during the public comment periods are summarized andresponded to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment Issue 1_Klamath River Fall Chinook Escapement Goal </ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Productivity of these stocks has increased in the pastthree years, leading to considerable uncertainty among technical staffof the Klamath Fishery Management Council as to what an appropriate escapementgoal should be. <T3>Response: </T3>The amendment is designed to determine the optimum carryingcapacity of the Klamath River Basin and hence the optimum spawning escapementgoal for fall chinook. It links spawning escapement to stock productivitysuch that, as stock abundance increases, escapement will be allowed toincrease proportionately, and as stock abundance decreases, escapementwill decrease proportionately, subject to a minimum level below which escapementwill not be allowed to fall in order to protect the stock's productivity.Under the amendment, a range of actual annual spawning escapements shouldresult from which better information on productivity of the Klamath RiverBasin will be obtained. It will take a number of years of assessing differentlevels of spawning escapement and the resulting stock production to determinethe optimum spawning escapement goal that may be expressed as a fixed escapementlevel or a fixed escapement rate.Theoretically, when optimum escapement is being achieved, the highest levelof sustainable biological yield also can be achieved because the optimumnumber of juvenile salmon for the productive capacity of the watershedwill be produced. The survival of the maximum number of juveniles thatcontribute to harvests will depend on many uncontrollable environmentalfactors affecting their life cycles. Over time, the amendment is expectedto provide information that will allow production of maximum sustainableyield (MSY) from the resource. <T3>Comment 2:</T3> The fixed 35 percent spawning escapement rate for KlamathRiver fall chinook stocks leaves the Council with almost no flexibilityto adjust this rate as changing conditions warrant. Only the Council'sSalmon Technical Team (STT) can approve a change in the spawning escapementand harvest rate percentages. The Council is unable to change the spawningescapement rate for social and economic reasons. <T3>Response:</T3> The Council is free to initiate either of two kindsof actions to modify the 35 percent spawning escapement rate for Klamathchinook without the STT's concurrence. Although the Council's STT neednot necessarily agree with the information on which such a modificationis based, the change must be based on the best scientific information available.Such a change could be implemented either by an amendment to the FMP under16 U.S.C. 1852(h)(1) or, if circumstances justify, by emergency actionof the Secretary pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1855(e). In addition to this procedure, the Council can initiate a change in the35 percent spawning escapement rate during the process of establishingannual management measures, but only if the STT concurs in the change.By imposing upon itself the requirement for STT concurrence before thespawning escapement rate can be changed without FMP amendment or emergencyaction, the Council has not delegated to the STT either its authority orresponsibility to determine optimum yield (OY). Rather, the Council hasdecided that, absent some indication from the STT that the spawning escapementrate is not based on the best biological information available, the currentspawning escapement rate should remain intact unless changed by amendmentto the FMP or by emergency action by the Secretary. The record indicates that the Council believed that the modification ofthe spawning escapement rate would be a rarity, realizing that in yearsof high abundance some additional economic benefits to the ocean fisheriescould not be enjoyed. By the same token, under the spawning escapementrate approach, when abundance is down, the ocean fishery does not sufferas much as if escapement were expressed in terms of immutable numbers offish. This was considered an appropriate downside risk which all user groupswere aware was necessary to test the carrying capacity of the Klamath Riverover time. The Council was concerned that, if the escapement rate wereallowed to change annually, for reasons other than technical adjustmentsby the STT, only because abundance was estimated to be above or below theprevious year, the long-term productive capacity of the river might neverbe known. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment Issue 2_Harvest Allocation of Non-Indian Fisheries Northof Cape Falcon, Oregon </ITAG>Almost all of the approximately 190 letters received addressed this issue,of which about 10 supported the revised allocation, and about 170 supportedthe status quo. (These numbers overstate the actual number of respondentsbecause many of them submitted multiple letters.) This issue was also thesubject of 35 petitions containing about 470 signatures in support of therevised allocation, and 118 petitions containing about 940 signatures insupport of the status quo. Many of the respondents opposed this portion of the amendment, suggestingit violates National Standards 4 or 5 of the Magnuson Act, in whole orin part. Comments directed to National Standards 4 and 5 will be addressedseparately, followed by other comments. National Standard 4 National Standard 4 states that ``Conservation and management measuresshall not discriminate between residents of different states. If it becomesnecessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various UnitedStates fishermen, such allocation shall be: (A) Fair and equitable to allsuch fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and(C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation,or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.'' Publiccomments on the National Standard 4 issue and responses are categorizedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Discrimination Between Residents of Different States </ITAG><T3>Comment 3:</T3> The reallocation of coho and chinook from the commercialto the recreational fishery discriminates between residents of differentstates. <T3>Response:</T3> Disagree. Access to the commercial or recreational allocationof coho or chinook in the United States exclusive economic zone (EEZ) inthe area north of Cape Falcon is open to anyone with a valid commercialor recreational fishing license, issuance of which by the States of Washingtonand Oregon does not depend on state of residency. <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Fairness and Equity </ITAG><T3>Comment 4:</T3> The condition of the fishery has not changed sufficientlyto warrant a departure from the framework allocation schedule. <T3>Response:</T3> The Council chose to restructure the allocation scheduleto address problems created partially by the current allocation scheduleand partially by very low stock abundances. In recent years, the ratiosof coho and chinook allocated to each fishery have resulted in incompletelyharvested quotas because of difficulty in structuring fishing seasons toharvest allowable allocations of both species. Numerous inseason regulatorychanges were necessary to utilize quotas more fully, resulting in confusionamong fishermen and decreased participation in the fishery. Recreationalseasons have been very short, which has been detrimental to local communitybusinesses dependent on attracting recreational fishermen from many differentgeographic areas. Modification of the allocation schedule will help amelioratethese problems and represents the Council's view as to what harvests willresult in optimum yield from the resource. <T3>Comment 5:</T3> Under the amendment, significant reallocation of cohoto the recreational fishery occurs at all levels of coho allowable harvest.There is no attempt to increase the troll allocation of chinook to equalizethis reallocation of coho. Because the amendment deviates from the statusquo, it is not fair or equitable to commercial salmon trollers who suffera net loss in benefits. <T3>Response:</T3> Disagree. The guidelines for National Standard 4 at50 CFR 602.14(c)(3)(i)(B) provide that ``An allocation of fishing privilegesmay impose a hardship on one group if it is outweighed by the total benefitsreceived by another group or groups. An allocation need not preserve thestatus quo in the fishery to qualify as `fair and equitable,' if a restructuringof fishing privileges would maximize overall benefits.''The guidelines for National Standard 4 at 50 CFR 602.14(c)(3)(i)(A) statethat ``An allocation of fishing privileges should be rationally connectedwith the achievement of OY or with the furtherance of a legitimate FMPobjective.'' A principal objective of the framework FMP is to manage andregulate the fisheries so that the OY encompasses the quantity and valueof food produced, the recreational value, and the social and economic valuesof the fisheries. The Council concluded that the current allocation schedule does not adequatelyoptimize the recreational value or the social and economic values of thefisheries consistent with the concept of OY. Specific allocation objectivesfor both commercial and recreational fisheries were adopted by the Councilin the belief that fishing regimes based on these objectives will betterachieve OY from the fishery. The revised allocation schedule, specifically adopted fishery allocationpriorities, and the measure providing flexibility to deviate from the allocationschedule are intended by the Council to guide it in establishing annualfishing regimes that will more fully utilize the available quotas and betterdistribute social and economic benefits among commercial and recreationalfishermen (i.e., by stabilizing and lengthening recreational seasons andmaximizing the value of the commercial catch). <T3>Comment 6: </T3>The wording accompanying the revised allocation scheduleis generalized and provides no protection for the troll industry. The Councilwould be allowed to reallocate most if not all of the commercial coho allocationto the recreational fishery and provide few if any chinook in exchange.<T3>Response:</T3> Disagree. The criteria described below limit the abilityof the Council to initiate preseason species trades that would be unacceptablydisadvantageous to either the recreational or commercial fisheries. Preseasonspecies trades, and any deviations from the exchange ratio of 4 coho to1 chinook, can only be made if they: (1) Are based upon the recommendationof the commercial and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representativesfor the area north of Cape Falcon, (2) simultaneously benefit both thecommercial and recreational fisheries or benefit one fishery without harmingthe other, and (3) are supported by a socioeconomic analysis that comparesthe impacts of the recommendation to those of the standard allocation scheduleto determine the allocation that best meets the allocation objectives.Therefore, the Council is prevented from initiating reallocations or exchangeratio modifications that would be unacceptably disadvantageous to the commercialtrollers. These criteria serve to protect the trollers from any perceivedabuse of discretion by the Council. <T3>Comment 7:</T3> The amendment would allow the Council to shift theall-species troll fishery south of Leadbetter Point, Washington, or evensouth of the Columbia River, which would be unfair to fishermen north ofLeadbetter Point and possibly discriminate against Washington fishermen.<T3>Response:</T3> The Regional Director received clarification from theCouncil on the provision for geographic deviation from the allocation percentagesbetween the two major subareas (from the U.S.-Canada border to LeadbetterPoint, and from Leadbetter Point to Cape Falcon). The Council recognizesthat geographic deviations in excess of 50 percent of the allocation thatwould have been established in the absence of the transfer have equityimplications and are to be used rarely. Deviations of more than 50 percentmay be made only if there is a conservation need to protect the weak stocksand the deviation will provide larger overall harvest for the entire fisherynorth of Cape Falcon than would have been possible without the deviation.This clarifying language also has been incorporated into the final implementingregulations. Further, this provision does not discriminate between citizens of differentStates. If the all-species troll fishery were shifted south of LeadbetterPoint or south of the Columbia River, participation in the fishery offOregon is open to citizens of other states. <T3>Comment 8:</T3> The economic analysis contained a comparison of changesin income impacts by user groups due to the amended allocation schedule.Out of 63 combinations of coho and chinook harvest levels tested, therewere 58 negative combinations for commercial and 0 negative combinationsfor recreational. This is not fair or equitable to trollers. <T3>Response:</T3> An economic model was used to project the benefits andcosts of the revised allocation schedule relative to the status quo. Theeconomic analyses demonstrated that the commercial fishery incurs mostlynegative impacts in net economic value (NEV) and local community incomeas a result of the amended allocation schedule when compared to the statusquo. However, the recreational fishery incurs offsetting positive impactsin NEV and local community income for most levels of total allowable harvestthat are likely to occur in the next few years. Overall benefits are maximizedby providing net positive impacts in NEV and local community income. <T3>Comment 9:</T3> The Council has broken the laws governing it that guaranteeuser groups parity in allocation issues. <T3>Response:</T3> Allocation guidelines for National Standard 4 do notguarantee parity to each user group. The Council's recommendation to revisethe allocation schedule to benefit the recreational fishery will betterachieve OY, further the objectives of the framework FMP, maximize overallsocial and economic benefits, and still meet the fairness and equity criteriaunder National Standard 4. <T3>Comment 10:</T3> In Washington State, less than 15 percent of the citizensare salmon sport fishermen. The revised allocation will deprive the remaining85 percent of their only access to Washington ocean-caught salmon, whichis from commercial ocean fishermen. <T3>Response:</T3> Disagree. Commercially caught salmon from the oceanoff Washington will continue to be available because the commercial allocationis only being slightly reduced, not eliminated. The commercial share ofcoho salmon is reduced only between 6 and 14 percent, while the commercialshare of chinook salmon ranges between a reduction of 4 percent and anincrease of 2 percent depending upon the abundance of each species. Commerciallycaught salmon are also available from ocean fisheries off Oregon, California,and southeast Alaska. <T3>Comment 11:</T3> Ocean sport fishermen have ample opportunity to takewhat one would consider a fair amount of salmon for an individual, includingthe opportunity to fish in inside waters such as the Columbia River mouth,Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and streams. <T3>Response:</T3> Agree. However, numerous commercial salmon fishing opportunitiesalso exist in inside waters. Also, commercial fishermen harvest salmonspecies not generally available to recreational fishermen in ocean waters(i.e., chum, sockeye, and pink salmon). <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Avoidance of Excessive Shares </ITAG><T3>Comment 12:</T3> The revised allocation scheme will promote severehardship on commercial fishermen in years of low abundance and may eliminatethe commercial troll fishery and give the entire resource to the recreationalfishery. <T3>Response:</T3> The guidelines for National Standard 4 at 50 CFR 602.l4(c)(3)(iii)imply that an allocation scheme is consistent with this part of the standardif it does not result in a monopoly of benefits from the fishery by anyparticular entity or group. The commercial share of coho salmon is reducedfrom a range of 31 to 69 percent under the current allocation scheduleto a range of 25 to about 55 percent (the percent increases as the cohoabundance increases) under the revised allocation schedule. Likewise, thecommercial share of chinook salmon changes from a range of 54 to 63 percentto a range of 50 to about 65 percent. Therefore, both user groups willcontinue to harvest significant shares of the resource, and no one groupwill be achieving what could be considered a monopoly. The revised allocationscheme does not result in allocation of an excessive share of the resourceto a single user group. National Standard 5 <T3>Comment 13:</T3> The imbalance in economic changes indicates that fisheryresources are being distributed among fishermen on the basis of economicfactors alone, in violation of National Standard 5. <T3>Response:</T3> The amendment has multiple purposes. A major purposefor the revised allocation scheme is to provide allocations to both commercialand recreational fishermen that can be fully harvested, to the extent possible,without leaving quantities of either fishery's quotas unharvested. Otherpurposes include better achievement of OY by more fully utilizing availablequotas, reducing the inseason regulatory burden and its resulting confusionto fishermen, providing longer and more stable recreational fisheries forthe social as well as economic benefit of coastal communities, and maximizingthe value of the commercial catch. Other Comments <T3>Comment 14:</T3> The revised allocation is not fair because it departsfrom the allocation schedule in the framework FMP that the Secretary agreedto adopt in a 1984 stipulation for dismissal of a pending court case broughtby the Washington Trollers Association (WTA). This stipulation will beviolated if the current allocation schedule is revised without WTA agreementand submission to the Court for approval. <T3>Response:</T3> The 1984 stipulation did not and could not obligatethe Secretary to maintain the current allocation schedule and could notdeprive the Council from its statutory responsibility to prepare, fromtime to time, such amendments to the FMP as are necessary. The Secretaryhas the duty to take action on such amendments. <T3>Comment 15:</T3> The draft amendment contained language on flexibilityto deviate from the allocation schedule that was agreed to by the usergroups and included in both alternatives to the status quo. At its November1988 meeting, the Council adopted a new alternative that contained flexibilitylanguage not included in the draft amendment. The final amendment failsto mention that this wording was changed by the Council and provides nodiscussion of the potential impacts of these changes. Agency compliancewith the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the issuanceof a second draft amendment and, if these flexibility provisions are includedas an alternative in this second draft, the upgrading of the environmentalassessment (EA) to a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS).<T3>Response:</T3> The final amendment contained flexibility language thatwas similar to and was based upon the draft amendment. It was modifiedby the Council based on public comment and discussion. The final amendment,while incorporating the revised flexibility language without mention ofthe specific changes in the wording, does analyze the impacts of the Council-adoptedalternative. Even with the inclusion of the revised flexibility provisions,the final EA concludes that no new significant impacts will result relativeto those described in the SEIS prepared for the framework FMP. Therefore,an EA, and not an SEIS, is the appropriate NEPA document for this action.NEPA does not require the issuance of a second draft amendment. <T3>Comment 16:</T3> The final EA contains a false and misleading analysisof the impacts that was not contained in the draft EA distributed for publicreview and comment. <T3>Response:</T3> The final EA contains an analysis well within the scopeof impacts examined in the draft EA. A notice of availability of the amendmentand its incorporated EA was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 54 FR 49 (January 3, 1989). Public commentswere considered by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, inhis determination that, based on the EA, the amendment will not have asignificant effect on the human environment and that a finding of no significantimpact (FONSI) is appropriate. This determination had the concurrence ofthe Director, Ecology and Environmental Conservation Office, NOAA Therefore,the EA and FONSI are the final environmental documents required by NEPA.<T3>Comment 17:</T3> The final framework amendment dated October 1984 doesnot adequately address the environmental impacts of complete eliminationof the salmon troll fishery north of Cape Falcon, which might be accomplishedunder the flexibility provisions to deviate from the allocation scheduleadopted by the Council at its November 1988 meeting.<T3>Response:</T3> The flexibility language adopted by the Council cannotbe used to eliminate the salmon troll fishery north of Cape Falcon. Therefore,the SEIS for the framework amendment and the EA for the amendment adequatelyaddress the environmental impacts of the revised allocation scheme. <T3>Comment 18:</T3> The amendment states that recent total allowable oceanharvest quotas have been consistently below those anticipated. A detailedanalysis of the reasons for the low harvest quotas is required since environmentaldocuments are supposed to be analytical. This analysis must also includethe past history of the Council's performance in monitoring the divisionbetween Indian and non-Indian fishermen. <T3>Response:</T3> The amendment specifically lists numerous reasons forthe reduced non-Indian ocean salmon fisheries north of Cape Falcon, includingthe constraints imposed by legal obligations for treaty Indian allocationrequirements and by inside/outside sharing. In addition, the Council annuallyproduces a comprehensive review of the coastwide ocean salmon fisheries,which specifically discusses trends in stock assessments and managementconcerns. This report is distributed to the public in February of everyyear. The Council and Secretary are responsible for managing the ocean fisheriesonly. They have no jurisdiction over non-ocean fisheries or the actionsof other management entities such as the States of Washington and Oregonand the treaty Indian tribes. Ocean quotas are designed to achieve appropriateCourt-ordered and/or negotiated treaty/non-treaty allocations. Detailsconcerning regulation of non-ocean fisheries usually are not availableduring the Council's preseason process of adopting management measuresbecause they have not yet been agreed upon by the State of Washington andthe treaty Indian tribes. Consequently, it is not possible for the Councilto predict nonocean treaty/non-treaty sharing in advance of the fishingseasons. The Council has received from the Washington Department of Fisheries, andmade available to the public, a post-season accounting of treaty/non-treatysharing of certain key coastal coho salmon stocks for 1985 and 1986. <T3>Comment 19:</T3> It is not true for the 1988 season that the currentallocation schedule resulted in extremely short recreational seasons. In1988 the entire total allowable commercial ocean catch of coho was tradedby the commercial fishermen to the recreational fishery; a large portionof the chinook allocated to the recreational fishery remained unharvestedat the end of the season because achievement of coho quotas closed therecreational fishery before the chinook quota could be caught. Analysisshould also include several past seasons and a discussion and comparisonof the status quo schedule and the revised schedule. <T3>Response:</T3> The 1988 allocation north of Cape Falcon was based onan agreement between representatives of both commercial and recreationaluser groups to trade the 34,000 commercial coho allocated by the frameworkschedule for 8,500 recreational chinook. Recreational representatives agreedto the species trades because the increased share of coho (and any reallocatedchinook not harvested by the commercial fishery) would extend the recreationalseason. This agreement was implemented by emergency regulation, not underthe allocation schedule in the FMP. When it was apparent that a considerableamount of the recreational chinook quota would remain unharvested, it wastoo late in the season for the commercial fishery to take advantage ofthis chinook without unacceptable impacts on coho. It is not always possibleto predict the harvest ratio for the two species. Table 3 of the amendment shows that the season length for the recreationalfishery in 1988 was 33 days, compared with the 1976-1980 average of 153days and a range of 37 to 107 days between 1981 and 1987. It is very likelythat in the absence of the trades, the recreational season would have beeneven shorter. Table 3 also provides annual data on season length beginningin 1981. <T3>Comment 20:</T3> Four negative signs were omitted in the draft amendmentand could have misled reviewers to conclude there were no negative impactsassociated with the non-status quo alternatives. <T3>Response:</T3> In those instances where negative signs were inadvertentlyomitted from the discussion of the range of socioeconomic impacts, thetext immediately following clearly stated negative impacts were found whenthe two alternatives were compared with the status quo. Also, referenceswere made to tables that contained the correct negative values. <T3>Comment 21:</T3> The amendment is false when it states that the presentframework FMP's allocation schedule has not adequately served the commercialand recreational fisheries. The amendment is also false when it statesthat the failure of the present allocation schedule has resulted in failureto fully attain OY. There have been no problems with the allocation schedule;the real problem has been the lack of realistic quotas and the flexibilityto transfer fish. To obtain OY in the 1988 season, less chinook shouldhave been allocated to the recreational harvest. The revised allocationschedule, however, allocates even more chinook to the recreational fishery.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees that recent allowable harvest levels ofcoho and chinook have been consistently below those anticipated at thetime the allocation schedule in the framework FMP was proposed and implemented.These levels are not expected to change significantly in the near future.However, the current allocation schedule has mandated the structuring offishing seasons that are not the most beneficial for either the commercialor recreational fisheries. Short commercial all-species seasons make itdifficult not only to predict the harvest potential of the commercial fleetand, thus, manage to a quota without exceeding it, but also to maximizethe value of the catch. Recreational seasons also have been very short,which has been detrimental to local community businesses dependent on fishingactivities. In response to these problems, the Council recommended revisingthe allocation schedule. Although the recreational chinook quota in 1988 was not completely harvested,a larger recreational chinook allocation was built into the revised allocationschedule to allow for increased recreational fishing opportunities througha chinook-only recreational fishery in years of low allowable coho harvest.Incorporating this provision into the schedule, instead of depending onpreseason species trades, provides additional assurance to local communitiesfor the base seasons that can be expected. <T3>Comment 22:</T3> The amendment states that a portion of the loss tothe commercial sector by the transfer of fish to the recreational fisheryis offset by the ability and practice of some commercial fishermen to moveto other fishing areas. This statement is incomplete because: (1) It doesnot identify the other fishing areas and how many Washington trollers havelicenses in these other areas or the availability and cost of these licenses,and (2) no mention is made that recreational fishing vessels also havethe ability to move to other fishing areas and participate in tuna, bottomfish,and whale watching trips. <T3>Response:</T3> Appendix Table B-2 of the amendment contains data oninterstate troller activity for 1985, which shows that, of the vesselsthat participated in the Washington fishery, 12 percent also participatedin Oregon and/or California. The availability and cost of state commercialfishing licenses are determined by the states. Appendix B mentions thatmany of the recreational charter vessels operating in the ocean also operatein the Columbia River. However, local communities that depend on recreationalfishing as an economic base are unable to move.Changes to Proposed Regulations This final rule makes the following changes to the proposed regulationsfound at 54 FR 2183, January 19, 1989. Items (1) through (4) are technicalcorrections or clarifications. Items (5) through (7) respond to the Council'sFebruary 27, 1989, letter which clarifies major aspects of Amendment Issue2 (harvest allocation north of Cape Falcon). (1) Add a technical correction at andSection; 661.2 to remove a referenceto the Magnuson Act as being defined below because the technical amendmentpublished at 53 FR 24644 on June 29, 1988, removed the definition of MagnusonAct from Part 661 and placed it in a new Part 620. (2) Delete andSection; 661.5(a)(16) because the provision prohibiting fishermenfrom fishing without first listening to the telephone hotline or the U.S.Coast Guard broadcast is unenforceable. Fishermen are advised in Appendixsection II.B.11 to monitor the hotline or broadcast to receive actual noticeof inseason actions. (3) Revise andSection; 661.23(a)(2) and Appendix sections II.B.11 and III.B.2(c)to clarify that inseason actions will be filed with the <T4>Federal Register </T4> as soon as practicable, and not as soon as practicablefollowing the action. When practicable, inseason actions will be filedbefore the action becomes effective. In andSection; 661.23(c)(2), add theparenthetical ``(telephone hotline and U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts)'' after``actual notice of the action.'' (4) Revise Appendix section II.B.2(a)(i) subparagraph (A) to clarify thatthe allocation schedule for the area north of Cape Falcon applies to allowablenon-treaty ocean harvest. Revise Appendix section II.B.2(a)(i) subparagraph(B) to read ``The initial allocation may be modified annually in accordancewith paragraphs (iii) through (v) of this section.'' (5) Redesignate Appendix section II.B.2(a)(iii) as section II.B.2(a)(v),and clarify the use of the fishery allocation priorities to structure seasonsas follows. The fishery allocation priorities will provide guidance inthe preseason process of establishing final harvest allocations and structuringseasons that best achieve the allocation objectives. To the extent fishare provided to each fishery by the allocation schedule, these prioritiesdo not favor one user group over the other and should be met simultaneouslyfor each fishery. Seasons may be structured that deviate from these prioritiesconsistent with the allocation objectives. (6) Redesignate Appendix section II.B.2(a)(iv) as section II.B.2(a)(iii),and clarify the preseason and inseason flexibility for deviation from theallocation schedule as follows. Deviations are to better achieve the allocationobjectives and the fishery allocation priorities. Preseason trades maybe made if they: (1) are based upon the recommendation of the commercialand recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives for the areanorth of Cape Falcon; (2) simultaneously benefit both the commercial andrecreational fisheries or benefit one fishery without harming the other;and (3) are supported by a socioeconomic analysis that compares the impactsof the recommendation to those of the standard allocation schedule to determinethe allocation that best meets the allocation objectives. Preseason tradeswill use the exchange ratio of four coho to one chinook as a desirableguideline. Inseason trades or transfers may vary from the guideline ratioto meet the allocation objectives. Deviations in geographic distributionof the allocation percentages that exceed 50 percent of the allocationthat would have been established in the absence of the transfer may bemade if there is a conservation need to protect the weak stocks and thedeviation will provide a larger overall harvest for the entire fisherynorth of Cape Falcon than would have been possible without the deviation.(7) Add a new Appendix section II.B.2(a)(iv) to incorporate the allocationobjectives that were included in the amendment but omitted from the proposedregulations. Classification The Regional Director determined that the amendment is necessary for theconservation and management of the ocean salmon fishery and that it isconsistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Council prepared a final environmental impact statement for the FMPand concluded that there will be no significant adverse impact on the humanenvironment. The Council prepared an environmental assessment for thisamendment. Based on this assessment, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheriesconcluded that there will be no significant impact on the environment asa result of this rule. The environmental assessment is part of the amendmentand may be obtained from the Council at the address listed above. The Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere has determined that this ruleis not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This determination was based on analysis of the regulatoryimpact review (RIR) prepared for this rule. This rule has a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small businesses for purposesof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus required an initial regulatoryflexibility analysis (IRFA). The RIR/IRFA is part of the amendment andmay be obtained from the Council at the address listed above. A summaryof the RIR/IRFA was published at 54 FR 2182, January 19, 1989. Based oncomments, no changes were made in the initial RIR/IRFA; therefore, thedocument is now a final RIR/RFA. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries has determined that this rulemust be effective no later than May 1, 1989, at which time commercial andrecreational ocean salmon fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon,and California are scheduled to open in accordance with the annual managementmeasures. These management measures are based on the provisions of thisrule. Therefore, it is impractical and contrary to the public interestto delay for 30 days the effective date of this final rule, and the agencyfinds good cause to waive the delayed effectiveness provision (5 U.S.C.553(d)(3)) of the Administrative Procedure Act. This rule contains, but does not put into effect a collection of informationrequirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) which wasproposed at 55 FR 11976. A request to collect this information has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as providedby section 3504(h) of the PRA. The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management programs of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California,and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Thisdetermination was submitted to the responsible state agencies and the SanFrancisco Bay Commission for review under section 307 of the Coastal ZoneManagement Act. All agencies either agreed with this determination or failedto comment within the statutory time period for comment. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 28, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Allocation of ocean harvest levels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Allocation schedule. (A) Initial allocation of coho and    chinooksalmon north of Cape Falcon, Oregon, will be based on the following schedule:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8,8</C>  <H1>Allowable non-treaty ocean harvest (thousands of fish) </H1><H1>Percentage \1\ </H1><H2>Commercial</H2><H2>Recreational</H2> Coho: <ITAG tagnum="2">0-300<D>25</D><D>75 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">andgreater;300<D>60</D><D>40 </D></ITAG>Chinook: <ITAG tagnum="2">0-100<D>50</D><D>50 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">andgreater;100-150<D>60</D><D>40 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">andgreater;150<D>70</D><D>30 </D><F>\1\ The percentage allocation is tiered and must be calculated in additivesteps when the harvest level exceeds the initial tier. For example, fora total allowable ocean harvest of 150,000 chinook, the recreational allocationwould be equal to 50 percent of 100,000 chinook plus 40 percent of 50,000chinook or 50,000 + 20,000=70,000 chinook.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The initial allocation may be modified annually in accordancewith paragraphs (iii) through (v) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Total allowable ocean harvest will be maximized to the extentpossible consistent with treaty obligations, state fishery needs, and spawningrequirements. Every effort will be made to establish seasons and gear requirementsthat provide troll and recreational fleets a reasonable opportunity tocatch the available harvest. These may include single-species directedfisheries with landing restrictions for other species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The following deviations from the allocation schedule will beallowed annually. These deviations provide flexibility to account for thedynamic nature of the fisheries and better achieve the allocation objectivesand fishery allocation priorities in paragraphs 2.(a) (iv) and (v) of thissection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Preseason species trades (chinook and coho) may be made if theyare based upon the recommendation of the commercial and recreational SalmonAdvisory Subpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon; simultaneouslybenefit both the commercial and recreational fisheries or benefit one fisherywithout harming the other; and are supported by a socio-economic analysisthat compares the impacts of the recommendation to those of the standardallocation schedule to determine the allocation that best meets the allocationobjectives. This analysis will be made available to the public during thepreseason process for establishing annual management measures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Inseason transfers, including species trades of chinook and coho,may be permitted in either direction between commercial and recreationalfishery quotas to allow for uncatchable fish in one fishery to be reallocatedto the other. Fish will be deemed uncatchable by a respective commercialor recreational fishery only after considering all possible annual managementactions to allow for their harvest that are consistent with the harvestmanagement objectives specified in the FMP including consideration of singlespecies fisheries. Implementation of inseason transfers will require consultationwith the pertinent commercial and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanelrepresentatives from the area involved and the Salmon Technical Team, anda clear establishment of available fish and impacts from the transfer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Preseason trades will use an exchange ratio of four coho to onechinook as a desirable guideline. Inseason trades or transfers may varyfrom the guideline ratio to meet the allocation objectives in paragraph2.(a)(iv) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) The percentages presented in the allocation schedule are averagesfor the entire area between Cape Falcon and the U.S.-Canada border. Thegeographic distribution of the allocation percentages may be varied bymajor subareas (i.e., north of Leadbetter Point and south of LeadbetterPoint) if there is need to do so to protect the weak stocks. Deviationsfrom the overall percentages in each major subarea will generally not exceed50 percent of the allocation of each species that would have been establishedin the absence of the transfer. Deviation of more than 50 percent willbe based on a conservation need to protect the weak stocks and will providelarger overall harvest for the entire fishery north of Cape Falcon thanwould have been possible without the deviation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) The goal of allocating ocean harvest north of Cape Falcon isto achieve, to the greatest degree possible, the following objectives forthe commercial and recreational fisheries. When deviation from the allocationschedule is being considered, these objectives will serve as criteria tohelp determine whether a user group will benefit from the deviation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Provide recreational opportunity by maximizing the duration ofthe fishing season while minimizing daily and area closures and restrictionson gear and daily limits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Maximize the value of the commercial harvest while providing fisheriesof reasonable duration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The following fishery allocation priorities will provide guidancein the preseason process of establishing final harvest allocations andstructuring seasons that best achieve the allocation objectives. To theextent fish are provided to each fishery by the allocation schedule, thesepriorities do not favor one user group over the other and should be metsimultaneously for each fishery. Seasons may be structured that deviatefrom these priorities consistent with the allocation objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000chinook: For the recreational fishery, provide coho for a late June throughearly September all-species season; provide chinook to allow access tocoho and, if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to the all-speciesseason; and adjust days per week and/or institute area restrictions tostabilize season duration. For the commercial fishery, provide chinookfor a May and early June chinook season and provide coho for hooking mortalityand/or access to a pink fishery, and ensure that part of the chinook seasonwill occur after June 1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000 coho and above100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, relax any restrictions inthe all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species season beyond LaborDay as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Day through lateJune chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to ensure continuitywith the all-species season. For the commercial fishery, provide coho foran all species season in late summer and/or access to a pink fishery; andleave adequate chinook from the May through June season to allow accessto coho.</ITAG>12.
