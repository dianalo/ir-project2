The Congressional office also suggested that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. doesn't have access to such funds.    &quot;Further congressional action may well be needed to obtain adequate funding,&quot; Frederick Wolf, director of the GAO's accounting and financial management division, concluded in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday.    Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), who is expected to be chairman of the panel next year, said the new Congress will have to deal immediately with the problem, which calls for &quot;some kind of restructuring&quot; of the thrift regulatory and insurance system. &quot;The structure that we have today is not getting the job done,&quot; he said.    GAO is auditor of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures more than 3,100 savings institutions.    Two private financial analysts, who also testified before the panel, said the restructuring could cost as much as $50 billion; another said $64 billion.    All the estimates far exceed that of the Bank Board, which last month put the cost at $15.3 billion to $21.8 billion. The GAO's Mr. Wolf said the Bank Board based its numbers on a series of &quot;optimistic,&quot; implausible assumptions.    Danny Wall, chairman of the Bank Board, insisted that FSLIC has sufficient resources to function effectively until late 1990, when the insurer is expected to exhaust the $10.8 billion in borrowing authority that it obtained from Congress last August.    Mr. Wall rejected the private analysts' suggestions that the board should be closing or merging insolvent thrifts much faster than its current funding allows. That would &quot;dump&quot; too many bad loans and foreclosed properties on the markets, he said, driving down already depressed prices in the Southwest.    The most pessimistic view of the industry came from Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant, who said it would cost $64 billion to close or cure all sick thrifts, and that at least $40 billion would have to come from the taxpayers.    There is little consensus in Congress on what to do. Several senators reaffirmed the government's commitment to fully protect every insured savings institution's deposits up to the $100,000 limit provided by law, but they didn't say where Congress would get the money.    Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) insisted, &quot;I am never going to support a taxpayers' bailout.&quot; Stanley Silverberg, former research director for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., replied that without funds from outside the thrift industry, &quot;the money just isn't there&quot; to deal with all the insured losses. </TEXT></DOC>
