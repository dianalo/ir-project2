The reactions came after the Iranian president, HashemiRafsanjani, said there are ``reasonable, prudent solutions'' to thehostage problem.   Rafsanjani's comments appeared to be the most hopeful indicationof a possible accommodation between the two countries since Islamicfundamentalists ousted the pro-American monarchy in Iran 10{ yearsago.   The loss of Iran into the anti-American camp was considered oneof the worst strategic setbacks for the United States since WorldWar II, given Iran's location and abundant oil reserves.   For the third day in a row, the State Department on Fridayissued a cautious but upbeat statement citing evidence that Iranwas moving away from its policy of unswerving hostility toward theUnited States.   ``We do not have a full text of President Rafsanjani's remarksand we are reacting cautiously to the reported excerpts,'' saidState Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``However, based onthe excerpts we have seen, President Rafsanjani's remarks appear tobe moderate and are therefore encouraging.   ``We have reason to believe that Iran is genuinely engaged andno reason to believe that its engagement is not focussed in apositive direction,'' she said.   But she added that any improvement in relations will becontingent on Iranian willingness to act ``responsibly in the worldarena to include an effort to resolve the hostage issue once andfor all by producing release of all our hostages and by making itclear that they have turned away from support of terrorism.''   For his part, President Bush said he would explore ``to thefullest'' Rafsanjani's offer of cooperation. But he added, ``Idon't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.''   Hours earlier, Rafsanjani had said in his weekly prayer sermonat Tehran University that Iran will ``help solve the problems'' inLebanon.   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said.   But, like the State Department statement, Rafsanjani attachedconditions to his offer of cooperation.   He said the United States must take the initiative by pressuringIsrael to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric itkidnapped from south Lebanon a week ago.   If the United States responds by saying it cannot do so, ``thisisn't acceptable to us,'' Rafsanjani said.   Still, Iranian behavior for much of the hostage crisis this weekhas been in marked contrast to what the United States wasaccustomed to under the rule of the late Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, who died in June.   The first hint of a new Iranian approach occurred Tuesday, whenRafsanjani and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze issued astatement in Tehran expressing regret over the reported killingMonday of Lt. Col. William Higgins.   The statement appeared to put Iran at odds with the pro-Iraniangroup in Lebanon that claimed to have carried out Higgins'execution.   Then, on Thursday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization inLebanon indicated in a statement announcing a reprieve in the deathsentence for American hostage Joseph Cicippio that it was bowing toIran's wishes.   In the past, Iran has also linked improved relations to U.S.release of Iranian assets frozen after the seizure of the U.S.Embassy in Tehran in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
