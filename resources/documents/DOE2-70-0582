One of the major goalsin all medical imaging techniques is to maximize one's ability to visualizeand differentiate adjacent tissue regions in the body on the basis ofdifferences in anatomy, physiology, or various pathological processes.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers distinct advantages over conventionalx-ray imaging because of the possibility of selecting specific pulsesequences that can differentiate adjacent structures on the basis ofdifferences in proton density, T{sub 1} or T{sub 2} relaxation rates,or flow. As a result of applying these various pulse sequences, numerousimages have been obtained of the brain and other organs that demonstrateconsiderably more-detailed anatomical structure than had previously beenavailable with computerized tomography, ultrasound, or nuclear medicinetechniques. In some situations it is clearly superior, such as in thediagnosis of multiple sclerosis.</TEXT></DOC>
