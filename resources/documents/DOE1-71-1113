<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-1113 </DOCNO><TEXT>China is currently undertaking a massive programme of power station construction- an estimated 25 GW of capacity is at present in various stages of planningand construction, involving over 17 different projects. Yet electricpower output remains a bottleneck in the economy and a 10% annual increasemay be required to keep pace with demand. Two organisations are responsible- the Huaneng International Power Development Company and the China NationalTechnical Import Corporation - and both rely on equipment from the Westor USSR. The largest demand for electric power comes from the southeastcoastal region but the coal resources are in the interior of northernChina and hydropower resources are in South West China; current plansfor increased rail links may be inadequate and coal imports have beenvetoed. A nuclear programme may be pursued as an alternative but theshortage of foreign exchange will again be a problem. Financing of plantpurchase for nuclear and fossil-fuel power plants will be achieved bya combination of barter, World Bank, government-to-government fundingand money from oil exports. Build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes arebeing considered.</TEXT></DOC>
