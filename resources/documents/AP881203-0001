The Industry Ministry informed oil companies operating in Franceon Friday that imports of Iranian crude are henceforth subject tothe usual French regulations governing oil imports.   France severed its diplomatic relations with Iran following the``Embassy War'' in the summer of 1987 when the Iranian Embassy inParis refused to allow Wahid Gordji, an interpreter withoutdiplomatic status, to be interrogated by a French judge inconnection with terrorist attacks in Paris in September 1986.   The French police blocked off the embassy and the Iraniansretaliated by preventing French diplomats in Tehran from leavingtheir embassy. Gordji and the French consul in Tehran wereeventually exchanged in November 1987.   The embargo was partially lifted Sept. 9 when France resumednormal diplomatic relations with Iran.   Oil industry officials said the partial lifting of the embargodid not have any practical effect because it simply involved givingauthorization to French oil companies on a case-by-case basis to dobarter deals involving Iranian crude.   The barter deals were negotiated by French trading houses andinvolved exchanges of French food and farm products, notably sugarand meat, for Iranian crude.   Industry sources said none of the barter deals was everconcluded, however, because the Iranian asking price was felt to betoo high in view of the bearishness of the oil market at the time.   Latest oil industry statistics show no imports of Iranian crudeby France in the first nine months of this year.   France imported 4.4 million tons of Iranian crude during thefirst eight months of 1987. Imports totalled 2.9 million tons in1986.   Jean-Louis Breuil-Jarrige, president of the French oil industryassociation, wrote to Industry Minister Roger Fauroux in June afterdiplomatic relations were restored to point out that the embargo washaving no real effect.   He argued that French refiners were importing petroleum productsmade from Iranian crude imported by other European refiners. Frenchoil companies also pointed out at the time that they had acompetitive disadvantage compared with European counterparts becauseIran was selling its crude relatively cheaply.</TEXT></DOC>
