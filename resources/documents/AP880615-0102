Ariane-4 is capable of hauling up to 4.6 tons into orbit.Ariane-3, the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8tons.   In addition to its increased power, the rocket design allowsengineers to strap on different configurations of solid and liquidboosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific budget andneeds, the agency said.   Ariane-4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launchservices market until the end of this century,'' according toArianespace officials.   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575, Ariane-4will be competing in the coming decade with America, the SovietUnion, China and Japan.   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloadsand currently holds 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion.   For the inaugural launch, Ariane-4 put into geostationary orbitMeteostat-P2 which will furnish weather data to 16 Europeancountries.   The 1,559 pound satellite will monitor weather over most ofEurope, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of SouthAmerica.   It replaces the Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which untilrecently sent back pictures every half hour.   The 330 pound Amsat-3C, known by the knickname Oscar-13, willserve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.   Meteosat and Oscar reached orbit about 20 minutes after blastoff.   About three minutes later, the American satellite PAS-1 reachedorbit. The satellite owned by the American telecommunicationscompany Pan American satellite will further telecommuncationsservice at moderate cost between Latin America, the United Statesand Europe.   Officials at the space center called the inaugural launch acomplete success.</TEXT></DOC>
