ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators seized New Jersey's largestsavings bank Friday after the institution recorded large lossesfrom real estate ventures in New Jersey, Florida and Texas.   The government transferred control of City Federal Savings Bankin Bedminster, N.J., to the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federalagency created in August to dispose of failed institutions.   ``City Federal was below all its capital requirements. Itdoesn't look to us like they could recapitalize this institutionwithout federal assistance,'' said Bob Albanese, senior deputydirector of the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, in New York.   ``And the institution is continuing to experience operationslosses and loan losses,'' Albanese said.   Chief Executive Officer John Atherton, other top City Federalofficers and the thrift's board of directors were removed andreplaced by a managing agent and an oversight team, while somemanagers were retained, he said.   City Federal Savings Bank officials could not immediately bereached for comment.   The savings bank had $9.8 billion in assets and $7.3 billion in858,348 deposit accounts, according to the federal Resolution TrustCorp., which has taken control of about 280 thrifts and hasdisposed of more than 30 nationwide.   The agency will either help find a buyer for the institution ordecide to liquidate it. City Federal has 105 retail branches in NewJersey and Florida.   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced RTC would overseeoperations of a new federal mutual association, City Savings Bank,which will maintain normal business hours and operations while apermanent resolution is sought.   ``For right now, it's business as usual,'' said Albanese.   Word of the thrift's potential collapse had been discussed inthe industry since the institution posted third-quarter losses.   ``It's not surprising,'' said William McCrystal, an analyst withRyan, Beck and Co. in West Orange, N.J. ``This is a largeinstitution. This is a sign of what's going to happen in theNortheast. This says the government is going to follow through onthe legislation passed to do something about these large, troubledthrifts.''   McCrystal said City Federal was plagued by bad commercial realestate and construction loans after becoming heavily involved inreal estate and mortgage banking.   As of Sept. 30, City Federal had $747 million in non-performingassets, which are past-due loans and loans that don't pay interest,and only $89 million in equity compared with $326.2 million at theend of 1988.   ``Under normal conditions, non-performing assets are no morethan 25 percent of equity,'' McCrystal said. ``With $89 million inequity, their losses probably would have wiped out equity had thefeds not stepped in.''   The thrift had said last month it would be unable to meet newcapital requirements that became effective Thursday under thethrift bailout law signed this past summer.   Four other New Jersey thrifts already have been taken over byfederal regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
