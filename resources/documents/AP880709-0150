(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of this southern Indiana farmingtown offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that werefound beneath bridges, behind businesses and two historic buildings.   The bombs, traced to a theft of dynamite last month in anotherIndiana town, were defective and failed to detonate, but thethought of what might have happened has made an impact on the townof 6,000.   Patrons at Donanna's Restaurant kidded each other Friday aboutthe 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blastingcaps.   ``They'll look under a chair and say `Is there a bomb underhere?' and laugh,'' said Forest P. Noland, a manager at therestaurant.   But, says Noland, ``it isn't anything to joke about, really.''   Rewards totaling $10,000 have been offered for information aboutthe explosives. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmsposted the original $5,000 reward Thursday, and the Indiana ArsonCrime Association matched that Friday.   ``Now anyone who calls stands to gain $10,000, so maybe it willhelp,'' said ATF spokesman Joe V. Thurman.   Thurman said about 35 investigators from his agency, the FBI,the Army and state police were in the town about 30 miles northwestof Louisville, Ky.   On Saturday, Thurman said the dynamite used in the bombs hadbeen traced to a theft at Mulzer Crushed Stone in English.   He said the dynamite, which was stolen between June 6 and 13,also has been linked to a bomb similar to those planted in Salemthat exploded along Indiana 37 about a mile south of English onJuly 1. The town of English is about 30 miles southwest of here.   ``A passing motorist reported some smoke and fire at a roadsiderest area,'' Thurman said. ``It was the same type of device and thedynamite was from the same theft.'' There have been no arrests inthe theft.   Three of the dynamite bundles found Tuesday morning detonatedpartially, producing smoke and small fires. Authorities closed offthe central business district and disarmed the 10 remaining bombs,which had been concealed in brown grocery bags and covered withdebris.   Mayor Frank Newkirk Sr. said the explosives were the work ofterrorists, but others disagree.   ``I think whoever did it just wanted publicity,'' said Noland.``If they were serious, they could have rigged at least one of themto go off, anyway, out of 13.''   The bombs failed to explode because black powder chargesintended to trigger the dynamite was improperly packed,investigators said.   Dynamite is no harder to obtain than a handgun in Indiana sinceit is used in road construction, in quarries and in mining. Itrequires careful handling, but the techniques are widely known inthe construction and mining trades.   ``I'm no expert, but you don't need to be a specialist forsomething like that,'' said Noland, who also owns a 130-acre farmoutside nearby Pekin.   Mitch Ferguson, a retired contractor who used explosives in roadconstruction, noted reports from investigators that the amount ofdynamite involved could have leveled a sizable portion of thedowntown.   ``They were just lucky that whoever did it didn't know anythingabout (black) powder,'' Ferguson said.   Police have refused to discuss a possible motive, and residentscould point to no community-wide disputes in the town.   ``I think they're interested in any theory,'' said state Rep.Frank Newkirk Jr., a former deputy county prosecutor who now has aprivate law practice.   A bomb containing 52 sticks of dynamite was found beneath thewooden back steps to his office, and Newkirk had a long meetingwith investigators late in the week.   Newkirk doubted he was the target of the explosives. And thefact that most of the bombs were placed near government propertymight not mean much either, he said.   ``Often with a crime like this, when you look for somephilosophical explanation, what you find instead is some personal,selfish explanation,'' he said. ``It's just as likely that this wasdone to destroy documents or collect insurance.''   Police and federal agents set up a command post at Salem HighSchool and questioned residents door-to-door throughout the week.Some found the police presence reassuring but wondered what wouldhappen if authorities left without making an arrest.   ``I find myself, when I drive down the street, looking in thefaces of the people I pass,'' said Newkirk. ``I'm asking myself `Isthis the kind of person who would do something like that?'''</TEXT></DOC>
