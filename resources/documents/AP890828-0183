AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opposition parties said Monday the newgovernment that takes over Sept. 1 will continue ``the militarydictatorship,'' but promised they will not take to the streets tofight the new regime.   In an official communique, the opposition coalition led by theChristian Democratic Party called on people to remain ``alert andwatchful and determined to impose through peaceful means itsvocation of democracy, justice and freedom.''   It did not call on Panamanians to protest in the streets, as ithas in the past.   Also Monday, pro-government parties met to discuss the formulafor a government that takes over Sept. 1 when the currentgovernment's term expires without an elected replacement.   Two possibilities were being discussed: forming acivilian-military junta or appointing an acting president withauthority to call elections in the near future.   The government annulled May 7 presidential elections, arguingU.S. intervention in favor of the opposition distorted the results.International observers backed opposition claims they won alandslide victory.   Washington accuses Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of thePanamanian defense forces, of canceling the elections in anothermove to fight U.S. attempts to have him removed from power.   Noriega has been indicted in the United States ondrug-trafficking charges. He denies the charges as another U.S.government plot to discredit him.   Oppositon parties refused a government offer to participate in acivilian-military junta on Sept. 1.   ``On Sept. 2, the government will find that it has not solved theeconomic crisis and its international isolation is worse than itwas,'' Christian Democratic leader and former vice presidentialcandidate Ricardo Arias Calderon told The Associated Press.   He said the new government will be ``another version of themilitary dictatorship.''   The government and opposition failed to agree on a new governmentbecause the opposition insists that Noriega retire. The governmentwill not consider dimissing the general who wields the real power inPanama.   The Organization of American States tried unsuccessfully tomediate the dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
