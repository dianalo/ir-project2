But the ruling left open the possibility that New Jerseydrivers, who already pay among the highest car insurancerates in the nation, may be subject to more rate increases.</LP><TEXT>   In a unanimous decision, the seven-member court turneddown an insurance-industry challenge to the Fair AutomobileInsurance Reform Act of 1990, which assesses the industry$1.4 billion over seven years to partly pay off debt incurredby the now-defunct pool for high-risk drivers, the JointUnderwriters Association.   &quot;The effort to strike down the law in its entirety hasbeen rejected by the court,&quot; said Tom Weidner, counsel forState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.   State Farm, Liberty Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.and Allstate Insurance Co. -- among the state's largestinsurers -- had challenged the constitutionality of the law,alleging that it deprives them of their right to make a fairand reasonable return on their businesses because ofprohibitions against passing through assessments to driversas premiums.   While the ruling supports the law's prohibition onautomatic, direct passthroughs, it does allow the insurers away to recover all, or part, of the surcharges andassessments related to the insurance pool by applying to theinsurance commissioner for rate increases. Attorneys for theinsurers say the process is likely to result in furtherchallenges to the law.   Nevertheless, Gov. Florio called the ruling a &quot;victory forthe drivers of New Jersey.&quot; He said, &quot;After years of beingout of control, our car insurance system is now back in thehands of the drivers.&quot; Jack Sabatino, assistant attorneygeneral, said, &quot;The overall scheme (of the law) has beenvalidated by the court.&quot;   Meanwhile, the American Insurance Association, a tradegroup, said, &quot;The only reason (the law) survived theconstitutional challenge was because one of its sectionsguarantees insurance companies an adequate rate of returnthrough the rate-making process.&quot;   Jerry Lane, regional vice president for State Farm, said,&quot;Our initial interpretation of the decision is that down theroad the state's JUA deficits will be paid by New Jerseymotorists&quot; through rate increases. Last year, State Farm'sJUA assessment was $18.7 million.   Auto insurance reform has been a priority for Gov. Florio,who made a campaign promise to abolish the insurance pool.The JUA was established in 1983 as a self-supporting insurerof last resort. But it ended up covering nearly half of NewJersey's 4.3 million insured cars as insurers began rejectingall but the least risky drivers because of rate curbs. By1990, the JUA had a deficit of $3.1 billion. To fund thepool, each insured car in the state was subject to surchargesof up to $222.   Under Gov. Florio's reform act, which was passed March1990, the JUA was abolished, and the so-called risky driversin the pool were distributed among the state's insurers. Thereform act also called for the insurance industry to pay for$1.4 billion of the JUA's deficit. It also eliminatedsurcharges on car owners.</TEXT></DOC>
