ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group led by the buyout firmForstmann Little andamp; Co. and that includes the consumer products giantProcter andamp; Gamble Co. has emerged as a possible ``white knight'' inthe fight for RJR Nabisco Inc.   Forstmann Little said late Friday the group was considering a bidfor the food and tobacco products company that would surpass a $20.7billion offer made by Nabisco management and a competing $20.3billion bid by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.   In a statement, Forstmann Little said a special committee of theRJR Nabisco board set up to review the offers ``had welcomed theinterest'' of the group, which also included the food companiesRalston Purina Co. and Castle andamp; Cooke Inc. and the investment firmGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   The statement appeared to indicate RJR Nabisco was seeking awhite knight, or a friendly suitor, that could outbid KohlbergKravis.   Kohlberg Kravis, a leveraged buyout specialist, had been expectedto answer the $92-a-share bid from RJR Nabisco management by raisingits own $90-a-share offer.   On Thursday, Kohlberg Kravis withdrew a $2.5 billion offer forthe publishing and information services giant Macmillan Inc., whichcould leave the investment firm with considerable resources to mounta battle for RJR Nabisco.   The combination of Forstmann Little and its partners could beexpected to easily counter a higher Kohlberg Kravis bid.   ``Each group member has indicated its intention to have acontinuing debt or equity participation in the entire transaction,''the Forstmann Little statement said.   Forstmann Little said RJR Nabisco had agreed to provide the groupwith confidential information about its finances.   There was no answer at the Atlanta offices of RJR Nabisco when areporter called late Friday to confirm the Forstmann Littlestatement. There also was no answer at the offices of KohlbergKravis' spokesmen.   If either of the outstanding bids, or a higher bid by theForstmann Little group, is successful, it would rank as the largestU.S. takeover in history.   On Wednesday, a day before the management bid was announced, thespecial committee of RJR Nabisco's board seemed to be attempting toflush out other offers when it issued a statement saying it wouldreview all other bids for the company from credible parties. Thecommittee's chairman, Charles Hugel, already had acknowledged thatthe sale of the company was a virtual certainty.   The battle over the nation's 19th largest industrial concern _the maker of such well known brands as Camel and Winston cigarettes,Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers _ began last month when companypresident F. Ross Johnson announced he and other top managers werecontemplating a $75-a-share deal valued at about $17 billion.   Kohlberg Kravis countered with its own offer and said it hoped adeal supported by RJR Nabisco's management could be worked out. WhenJohnson's group rebuffed the firm, Kohlberg Kravis launched a tenderoffer directly to stockholders, but still made the bid contingent onwinning management's cooperation.   Kohlberg Kravis, RJR Nabisco and one of its financial partners inthe management-led buyout, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., talked offand on over the past two weeks without success about a possiblejoint effort to buy the company.   Discussions that pitted Shearson Chairman Peter Cohen against hisone-time skiing partner, Henry Kravis, over joining forces to takeover RJR Nabisco also deteriorated.   Kohlberg Kravis said the management bid ``did not foreclosefurther discussions in the future although there could be noassurances that such discussions would occur.''   Procter andamp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, is the nation's17th largest industrial company with sales of $17 billion in 1987.   It is a leading soap and detergent maker, with brands such asTide, Cheer, Ivory, Zest and Oxydol. It also makes and markets Headandamp; Shoulders and Prell shampoos, Charmin bathroom tissue, Criscoshortening and Folgers coffee.   St. Louis-based Ralston is the world's largest producer of drydog and cat foods, including the Purina Dog and Cat Chow labels.   It is also a leading maker of dry-cell batteries, including theEveready and Energizer brands, and makes Chex cereals and Wonder andHostess snack foods. Ralston had 1987 sales of $5.87 billion.   Castle andamp; Cooke Inc., based in Hawaii, grows, processes andmarkets foods including Dole fresh fruits and processed foods andBud fresh vegetables.   Its sales in 1987 amounted to $1.75 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
