The price monitoring panel, which tracks world oil trends andOPEC member compliance with the organization's output policies,called for a joint meeting of the price committee and another OPECgroup, the Long-Term Strategy Committee.   The joint meeting, which could be held in October, would reviewthe objectives and strategies of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, the ministers said in a communique followingthe meeting.   OPEC Secretary General Subroto, speaking to reporters, said thatthe ministers would decide following the joint session whether tocall for a full gathering of the cartel before November.   The ministers began meeting Sunday to review ways to harness asurge in production being blamed for forcing down internationalcrude prices, an OPEC source said.   The meeting of the Price Evolution Committee of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries began just after 11 a.m. at theIndonesian embassy in the Madrid suburbs.   The committee comprised of delegates from Nigeria, Algeria,Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela was not expected to take anydecisive action, the source said.   The meeting was called after the recent slump in crude oilprices due largely to burgeoning oil production by OPEC members,analysts say.   The Paris-based International Energy Agency reported OPEC wasproducing 19 million barrels a day in August, far more than the15.06 million barrel ceiling set by the cartel last June.   In recent weeks world oil prices have fallen to their lowestlevel since the summer of 1986 when they dropped below $10 a barrel.   World oil prices firmed slightly in the days leading up to themeeting as hopes escalated that the gathering might lead to a fullmeeting of the oil cartel and a restoration of quota disciplinewithin the group.   Although the committee, which monitors crude prices and membercompliance with OPEC policies, has no enforcement powers, it canrecommend an emergency meeting of all 13 OPEC member nations priorto the scheduled fall session set for Nov. 21 in Vienna.   Meanwhile, Iraq's Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi wasquoted as saying that falling oil prices would not deter Iraq fromboosting its production.   In an interview published Monday in Nicosia, Cyprus, the Iraqiminister reiterated earlier statements that Iraq would not adhereto its OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and instead was inthe process of increasing oil output to 4.5 million barrels a dayby 1991.   The minister said Iraq needed to boost its oil revenue torebuild its economy shattered during an eight-year Persian Gulf warwith Iran.   Other OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates, also are reported to be exceeding their quotas andcompeting for market share, leaving some analysts skeptical aboutthe cartel's ability to reinstitute discipline among theorganization's members.   On Sunday, the price committee held a one-hour formal meeting atthe same embassy in the Madrid suburbs and discussed a report onthe current state of world oil prices and production, a seniordelegate said.   The OPEC source said the meeting was likely to break for lunchMonday at 1 p.m. and then resume talks in the afternoon.   The source also said Indonesian OPEC Secretary General Subroto,who is also attending, may make a statement to reporters laterMonday.   He described the report as ``not very good.''   On Friday, North Sea Brent crude for October delivery dropped to$13.10 per barrel on rumors later proven false that Saudi ArabianOil Minister Hishan Nazer would not appear at the price committeemeeting.   By 12 p.m. Monday, North Sea Brent crude for October deliveryhad risen to $13.25 per barrel.   Algeria, whose minister hosted a dinner here Saturday for hiscommittee colleagues, has complained to Saudi Arabia and other Gulfproducers that failure to respect OPEC production quotas is causingserious hardships for other OPEC members whose economies aredependent on oil revenues.   Besides Saudi oil minister Nazer, the others at the meetinginclude OPEC chairman Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oilminister, Algeria's Belkacem Nabi, Indonesia's GinandjarKartasasmita and Venezuela's new oil minister Julio Cesar Gil.</TEXT></DOC>
