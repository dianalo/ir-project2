The study, what's more, is going to be hard for theindustry to ignore or dispute: It was commissioned by theindustry itself. &quot;Not only does the public hold the industryin low esteem,&quot; the survey concludes in part, &quot;they alsobelieve strongly that the industry is moving in the wrongdirection.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The new survey, prepared by Wirthlin Group, McLean, Va.,was conducted on behalf of the Century Council, a groupformed by the alcohol industry in June. Though it hasn't beenreleased publicly, copies are circulating among anti-alcoholactivists and legislators on Capitol Hill.   The study undercuts the industry's frequent insistencethat its critics are fringe-group &quot;neo-Prohibitionists.&quot;Instead, it suggests that its critics' views are widely anddeeply held among Americans.   For example, the survey concludes that overall, the publicviews the industry as &quot;not honest and ethical,&quot; &quot;not acredible source for information,&quot; and &quot;uncaring.&quot;Particularly troubling for the alcohol industry, anoverwhelming 73% of people polled said they either &quot;strongly&quot;or &quot;somewhat&quot; agree that alcohol advertising is &quot;a majorcontributor&quot; to underage drinking.   Activists are already regarding the study as ammunition intheir battle to pass a pending bill that would put warningmessages in alcohol advertisements. The measure is sponsoredby Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D., Mass.) and Sen. StromThurmond (R., S.C.). The new survey &quot;clearly gives thelegislation more credence,&quot; said Maureen Toal, Mr. Kennedy'spress secretary. &quot;The public clearly understands the role thealcohol industry plays in encouraging underage drinking,&quot; shesaid.   &quot;The bottom line is, the industry has to make profoundchanges in the way they advertise their products or they areextremely vulnerable to government intervention,&quot; saidChristine Lubinski, director for public policy at theNational Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.   The study's conclusions -- particularly regardingadvertising and teen drinking -- are already drawing firefrom some alcoholic beverage companies that aren't affiliatedwith the council. Spirits makers and especially beercompanies have insisted for years that their marketingefforts aren't aimed at and don't influence juveniles.   Among the critics is Anheuser-Busch, which has weathered abarrage of criticism over its &quot;spokesdog&quot; Spuds MacKenzieand, more recently, its Bud Man cartoon promotion.Advertising &quot;really isn't a factor&quot; in juvenile drinking,contends Joseph Castellano, an Anheuser-Busch vice president.He cited studies that he said concluded that advertisingisn't even a perceived cause of teen drinking.   The Century Council itself -- which insists it is anindependent anti-alcohol abuse group, even though it wasfounded and is funded by alcohol companies -- played downsome of the survey's harsher findings. Peter Dailey, itspresident, said the survey reflects perceptions rather thanreality and that the industry is &quot;more credible than thepublic perceives it to be.&quot;   He said that whatever perception problems exist will becleared up by the council's new code of conduct foradvertising, which goes into effect Oct. 1.   The voluntary code dictates, among other things, thatalcoholic beverages shouldn't be &quot;actively promoted&quot; atevents where most of the audience is underage. But a footnoteexplains that the restriction doesn't apply to professionalsports events or to signs already present in stadiums andarenas. The code also prohibits practices such as marketingto underage drinkers, referring to alcohol content andmarketing at college events -- though apparently campusmarketing is fine if it doesn't violate the college's rules.   Perceptions, Mr. Dailey said, will change because of thecode -- but he immediately added that &quot;most&quot; alcoholcompanies are already working within the guidelines and won'tneed to change their ads anyway. If the few companies thataren't currently within the code begin to follow it, he said,&quot;maybe that will begin to change perceptions.&quot;   Mr. Dailey stresses that the council's primary goal is toprevent alcohol abuse, not clean up the industry'sreputation. But the survey suggests that marketing changesare urgently needed.   In the council's poll of 1,500 adults last August andSeptember, 62% of respondents agreed that the industry is onthe &quot;wrong track.&quot; Asked why, the most prevalent response wasthat &quot;ads target young&quot; -- a reason that showed up more oftenthan alcohol-related accidents and deaths. Some 95% of peoplepolled said teen-age drinking is a problem, and 75% agreedthat the problem has become worse in the past five years.   &quot;Clearly,&quot; the study says, &quot;the industry must direct itsaction against alcohol misuse if it is to build a favorableimage among its stakeholders.&quot;   The study shows, in fact, that the alcohol industry'sefforts to promote moderation have done more than anythingelse to improve its image. Of the 29% of consumers whobelieve the industry is moving in the right direction, thelargest single reason given in response was its &quot;Don't drinkand drive&quot; ads.   Despite the study's harsh conclusions, alcoholic beveragecompanies show no sign of changing their ways. &quot;The factthere are some misperceptions wouldn't be reason to changethe advertising,&quot; said George Kuehn, a senior vice presidentat Stroh Brewery Co. Peter Seremet, a vice president forHeublein Inc., maker of Smirnoff vodka, said Heublein alreadyis involved in &quot;Don't drink and drive&quot; campaigns. &quot;Was {thesurvey} disappointing?&quot; he asks. &quot;Sure. But was it a bigsurprise? No.&quot;   ---   Chiat Unit Wants Out                                                                                                          Anderson andamp; Lembke, the unit of Chiat/Day/Mojo thatspecializes in creating business-to-business advertising, isnegotiating with Chiat to buy a majority interest back.   Hans Ullmark, the unit's president and chief executiveofficer, confirmed industry reports that the agency is thelatest Chiat unit seeking to buy majority ownership back. Mr.Ullmark said that if the agency strikes a deal, Chiat wouldprobably retain a minority interest. &quot;We really likeChiat/Day,&quot; he said. &quot;But we've found out that it suits usbetter to be on our own.&quot; In the past year or so, other Chiatunits including Bright andamp; Associates and Jessica DeeCommunications, as well as the San Francisco office of Chiat,have repurchased majority stakes.   Mr. Ullmark said the Chiat parentage had increasinglycreated problems so that Anderson andamp; Lembke couldn't pitch forcertain accounts that conflicted with existing Chiat clients.   Anderson andamp; Lembke, whose major clients include Agfa andSun Microsystems, has billings of about $67 million, Mr.Ullmark said. The agency is headquartered in New York and hasan office in San Francisco. It couldn't be determined whatprice Anderson andamp; Lembke executives might pay for the stake.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          U.K. ACCOUNT: Nissan Motor (GB), the Japanese car maker'sBritish marketing arm, named TBWA/Holmes Knight Ritchie tohandle its ad account. Billings are estimated at $40 million.Nissan is currently setting up a dealer network in the U.K.;it previously sold its cars through a distributor, withSaatchi andamp; Saatchi Advertising handling ads. TBWA ChairmanWilliam Tragos said the win would remove his agency from therunning for Mazda Motor's pending Amati line. TBWA, whichdoesn't have a car account in the U.S., has often beenmentioned as a possible contender for the coming luxury-carline, which had been code-named Pegasus.
