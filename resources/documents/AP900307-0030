But those who set the clock at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientistsback four minutes Tuesday _ from six minutes to 10 minutes beforemidnight, or nuclear destruction _ pointed out that nuclear weaponsexist in alarming numbers.   ``The likelihood of a full-scale nuclear holocaust has beenreduced,'' said Leonard Rieser, chairman of the Bulletin's board ofdirectors, before moving the minute hand on the bronze 18-inchinstrument that hangs in the magazine's headquarters at theUniversity of Chicago.   The 21 directors, 41 sponsoring scientists and editor of theBulletin voted on the question of changing the clock inmid-January. Only four said the clock shouldn't be changed, whiletwo wanted it set even farther from doomsday.   Tuesday's move marked the eighth setting of the clock in its43-year history.   ``Most Americans have thought of the Cold War as a permanentfacet of international relations,'' said Gloria Duffy, a boardmember and president of Global Outlook, a Palo Alto, Calif.,security research institute. ``They never expected it to change intheir lifetime.''   Dr. Michael McCally, a University of Chicago doctor, was amongthose opposing change. ``My concern is with the weapons''proliferation, he said.   The clock came closest to midnight _ just two minutes away _ in1953, after the United States successfully tested the hydrogen bomb.</TEXT></DOC>
