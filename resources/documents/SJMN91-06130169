But in 1941, it was noteworthy becauseCole became the first black employee of the city's transportation system. Itwas before Jackie Robinson broke the color line of major league baseball,before Rosa Parks declined to yield that seat on the bus, before Martin LutherKing Jr. conveyed his dream to the world.;    Other Muni employees didn't taketo Cole too kindly. They threatened to get Cole's wife, Josephine, fired fromSt. Vincent's, where she was the only black teacher.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MUNI'S FIRST BLACK WILL TELL THE WAY IT WAS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Today on the Peninsula  </MEMO><TEXT>     And it was a while before Cole got his job training. Fourteen workers weresuspended for refusing to train him.;    The city was different then. Therewere two black doctors, one black dentist and a handful of other professionalblack men. And being a motorman was a &quot;white man's job.&quot; Shortly after he wentto work for Muni, Cole quit to enlist in the Army to fight in World War II.;   Cole and his wife will talk about their experience of being black in SanFrancisco at Stanford's Little Theater on May 28, from noon to 1 p.m. Thetheater is at the rear of Memorial Hall, across from Hoover Tower on SerraStreet.;    The event, sponsored by the African-American Staff and theStanford Staffers, is part of the university's centennial celebration.

In recent weeks, staffers haveapproved removal of 50 trees and relocation of six. A record. Six requestswere turned down. Many of the timbers to be cut down are at El Camino Hospitaland San Antonio Shopping Center, where more developments are taking place.There should be little loss of green acres, however. Developers are requiredto grow two trees for every mature one cut down.; MORE TIMBER: Sometimes,thieves will take anything. A police blotter in a local weekly noted that nine3-foot redwood trees were &quot;dug up and removed from a yard in the 800 block ofCanada Road sometime between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m. . . . Their value is $230.&quot;Whoa. The daring act occurred in broad daylight. In the protected haven ofWoodside, for that matter.; ROSEBUD: Palo Alto's Stanford Theatre reported thesecond-highest attendance of 10 movie houses in the United States showing there-release of &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;;    Only the Castro Theater in San Franciscorecorded higher patronage than Stanford, where 6,100 people waited in line tosee the Orson Welles' masterpiece.
