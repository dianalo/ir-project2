(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CD-ROM Takes On Dial-Up DataandM;By now, everyone has heard about the benefits of compact disc-read onlymemory (CD-ROM).andP;  A single $2 disc can hold 600 megabytes of information.andO;Ordinary PCs work well as CD-ROM workstations.andP;  And CD-ROM drives haveplummeted in cost to about the same level as high-end dot matrix printers.andO;But what does this new form of data distribution mean to corporatewidedatabases?andM;Plenty.andP;  Many companies are finding a natural fit between remote databasesand CD-ROM.andP;  In some cases, firms are extending the reach of databases suchas parts catalogs or bill of materials listings by providing information viaboth on-line terminals and CD-ROM.andP;  Other businesses are doing away with moreexpensive remote access altogether in favor of low-cost CD-ROM workstations.andO;In many situations, the mainframe or some other host-based system is stillused for database maintenance.andP;  Only the means of information distributionand retrieval is changed and, in virtually all cases, considerably enhancedby the use of CD-ROM.andM;&quot;A significant percentage of in-house CD-ROM applications are formermainframe-access situations,&quot; says Julie Schwerin, president of Infotech, aconsulting company in Pittsfield, Vt.andP;  What's driving these companies towardCD-ROM, says Schwerin, is a combination of high telecommunications costs foron-line database access; rising costs of paper and distribution formaintenance manuals and other lengthy documents; and end-user need forfaster, more flexible information retrieval.andM;Extending The MainframeandM;While corporate converts to CD-ROM rely on those devices for datadistribution, they continue to use mainframes for data gathering andcentralization, says Schwerin.andP;  Some former mainframe-only shops withtime-sensitive data combine on-line database access with monthly or quarterlyCD-ROM updates so that users always have access to the most up-to-dateinformation.andM;Companies that maintain both on-line and CD-ROM access are finding CD-ROM tobe far more powerful than remote access alone.andP;  Two years ago, Ford NewHolland Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer based in New Holland, Pa.,andO;discovered that CD-ROM was the fastest and most practical way to distributeparts and pricing information to its dealer network.andP;  As a new conglomerateof three former tractor and farm equipment manufacturers, Ford New Hollandbestowed its IS staff with three different mainframe systems.andP;  Each systemcontained parts and pricing information, which the company delivered todealers primarily through catalogs, microfiche and on-line access.andM;Despite the on-line capability, Ford New Holland's dealers were not gettingall the information they needed conveniently brom a single source.andP;  Thecompany discovered CD-ROM as a way to extend the reach of its mainframe data,says Carmen Martin, dealer services project specialist with Ford New Holland.andM;In order to produce quarterly CD-ROM updates for the field, Martin regularlytakes nine-track mainframe tapes from her IS department and moves the dataover to an IBM PS/2 model 80 equipped with two 300-megabyte drives.andP;  Usingindexing and authoring software from Cambridge, Mass.-based DatawareTechnologies Inc., she then &quot;premasters&quot; some 400MB of data--that is, sheformats them for CD-ROM production.andP;  Afterwards, the data are distributed ondisc to 700 dealers, each of which is equipped with an IBM PC compatible withCD-ROM drive.andP;  Martin hopes to have all 2,000 dealers using CD-ROM by the endof 1992.andM;There are incentives for switching to CD-ROM, not least of which is the lowcost of entry.andP;  Ford New Holland dealers who are already using PCs can add aCD-ROM drive for under $1,000.andP;  More important, the CD-ROM is the only placedealers can go to conveniently get pricing information from all three formercompanies that make up Ford New Holland today.andP;  &quot;We give them a lot moreinformation on the CD,&quot; explains Martin.andP;  New data on the CD include productusage details and parts expiration information.andP;  And many dealers now extractpricing information from the CD-ROM to update their internal accountingsystems.andP;  &quot;When the CD-ROM first came out, dealers thought that it was a newtoy,&quot; recalls Martin.andP;  &quot;Now that they've had it, they realize they can domore searches using different kinds of combination search criteria than everbefore.&quot;andM;A New SynergyandM;Chicago-based R.R.andP;  Donnelley Technical Documentation Services, part of the$3 billion printing company R.R.andP;  Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., offers databaseservices.andP;  It has also found synergy between mainframe data and CD-ROM.andP;  Fiveyears ago, Intel Corp. asked Donnelley to design on-line access for its hugedatabase of semiconductor product information.andP;  Donnelley had been keepingIntel's database on an IBM 4381 used in the production of thousands of paperdata sheets sent to distributors, sales people and product designers.andM;Donnelley's on-line system went live three years ago.andP;  It allowed dial-updatabase access for field personnel equipped with standard IBM PCcompatibles, modems and laser printers.andP;  &quot;The downside was thetelecommunications,&quot; recalls Richard Thorn, a Donnelley general manager.andO;&quot;Even with our data compressing, it would still take about 40 or 50 secondsto send a page at 9,600 baud.&quot;andM;Intel's product database is still running on the mainframe and is still usedfor print production purposes, but the expensive telecommunications link hasbeen cut.andP;  After considering various lower cost modes of distribution toovercome the problems of print and data transmission--including downloads toa local hard disk and use of write once, read many (WORM) drives--Intel andDonnelley settled on CD-ROM.andM;Today, Donnelley produces &quot;Data On Demand&quot;--the CD-ROMs for Intel--each monththrough an automated process that pulls text and graphical information offthe mainframe, processes it on a DEC VAX and ultimately loads it onto a PCfor index and retrieval processing using Dataware's software.andP;  A PC usertakes the data through various simulations and into premastering.andP;  Formatteddata are then sent to a mastering house for actual CD-ROM production.andM;&quot;Data on Demand has solved a real tough problem for engineers with theirclosets full of data sheets,&quot; says Donnelley's Thorn.andP;  &quot;The name of the gameis to get the data sheet under the design engineer's face.andP;  With themainframe software, users just didn't have the search capabilities thatCD-ROM gives them.andP;  Now we have a whole new era of finding information.&quot;andM;A New Market EmergesandM;IS managers are just now discovering the benefits of in-house CD-ROMdistribution, but dozens of companies that sell proprietary information arealready into full CD-ROM production.andP;  Yet few of those suppliers that beganby selling their information on line have abandoned telecommunicationsaltogether.andM;National Planning Data Corp., a large vendor of demographic databaseinformation and related software, is one such company.andP;  For 20 years, theIthaca, N.Y., firm supplied its data on magnetic tape and through on-linecustomer access to its DEC VAX minicomputer.andP;  When the company began to sellhigh-resolution satellite images for market analysis purposes, however,on-line access to the 50MB of data per image became impractical.andM;Now the information is available on CD-ROM.andP;  National Planning markets afour-drive CD-ROM system that uses 386-based PCs.andP;  The system allowscustomers to analyze actual satellite images of the United States and then toexamine demographic data that relate directly to the image.andP;  The demographicdata include such items as Zip code locations and the number of householdswith income over a certain amount.andM;Not all of National Planning customers have switched to CD-ROM, despite theadvantage it offers in data storage.andP;  &quot;The VAX is the core of our business,&quot;says chief operating officer Andy Paul.andP;  &quot;For every client who wants a CD-ROMdesktop system, there are still 10 people who need information on line.&quot;andP;  Thereason: many customers still require up-to-the-minute information retrieval,an obvious advantage that telecommunications will always have over the morestatic CD-ROM.andP;  &quot;I view CD-ROM as a product extension and not a replacementfor other technologies,&quot; says Paul.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
