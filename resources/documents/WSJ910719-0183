The Central Park Zoo, for example,has problems of its own, as do many zoos that are dependenton municipal funding.   Still, London Zoo is special. In the first place, there isits literary celebrity, as in Hilaire Belloc's &quot;Jim, Who RanAway From His Nurse, andamp; Was Eaten by a Lion&quot; (moral: &quot;alwayskeep a-hold of Nurse/For fear of finding something worse&quot;),which is set at London Zoo, as is the late Sir Angus Wilson's&quot;The Old Men at the Zoo,&quot; in which the animals in Regent'sPark even survive a nuclear war. And there is &quot;A Man in theZoo&quot; by Bloomsbury Group member David (&quot;Bunny&quot;) Garnett, inwhich a spurned lover offers himself to the zoo, and isaccepted, for exhibition as a specimen of Homo sapiens.</LP><TEXT>   In the second place, London Zoo is architecturallysignificant. It is chock full of protected, &quot;listed&quot;buildings. When I visited the zoo recently, the koala bearswho now inhabit Bertold Lubertkin's listed Gorilla House(1933) were as somnolent as ever, and the penguins in thesame architect's listed abstract sculptural Penguin Pool(1934) seemed to be suffering as much as the visitors fromthe unseasonable June chill. The birds in Lord Snowdon'sas-yet-unlisted aviary were almost grounded by the cold, andthe elephants were huddled for warmth in Sir Hugh Casson'smodern and still-unlisted Elephant House. I couldn't see whatwas going on in Decimus Burton's listed Giraffe and HippoHouse (1836), and the monkeys and apes were sheltering fromthe weather in their houses opposite his listed II ClockTower (1830).   Finally, some of the animals in London Zoo are unusual.When I visited, Chia Chia the giant panda was in Mexico City,where it was hoped he could be persuaded to father a newentry in the international giant panda stud book, which isoverseen by London Zoo's Jo Gipps. He also looks after thebreeding records of the golden lion tamarin (a small SouthAmerican squirrel monkey) and those of Sumatran tigers. Histwo pairs of young Asian lions are particularly important, inview of the recent discovery that the captive population ofAsian lions in the U.S. is made up not of purebreds, but ofanimals that have at some point acquired an admixture ofAfrican-lion bloodlines.   Not counting insects, there are 8,000 animals at the&quot;mother of zoos&quot; (it opened in 1826) that will have to berehoused or disposed of if it closes, as is now threatened,in September 1992. There is obviously an element ofbrinkmanship in the posture of the new director general,David Jones, and the zoo's treasurer, Lord Peyton of Yeovil.The zoo is losing approximately $2.5 million a year, has cashreserves of only $8.25 million, and doesn't seem able toattract the 1.4 million visitors it needs every year to stayin the black. In 1988 the government gave it aonce-and-for-all grant of $16.5 million, and MichaelHeseltine, the minister for the environment, and his juniorminister, David Trippier, are standing pat.   In this zoo poker game Mr. Trippier is now claiming thathis ministry is reflecting the most up-to-date thinking aboutzoos -- that such urban institutions are unsuitable, evenimmoral, from a conservation point of view. His critics sayit is hypocritical of the government to latch onto theprejudices of animal-rights activists. Lord Peyton,meanwhile, has called the ministry's bluff by hinting that itwill be the Department of the Environment's fault if theanimals have to be put down.   The British, as is well-known, are wacko about animals.Old ladies really do leave their fortunes to cat and doghomes. The government has to call a general election withinthe next year, and as the Tory newspaper the Daily Telegraphsaid in a recent editorial, &quot;The zoo's directors know that nogovernment facing an election in the next few months couldface doing so against a background of mass executions ofanimals taking place a few miles north of Westminster.&quot;Perhaps it is malicious to suggest that this was the reasonthat the deadline for closing the zoo was just moved ahead to1992.   Of course, the zoo may not close at all, if sufficientfunds can be raised. But it is perhaps not too early to thinkabout what the worst case would entail. Auberon Waugh, in hiscolumn in the Daily Telegraph (the Conservatives are muchmore exercised about the issue than is the Labor Party), hasmade two modest proposals. As nobody would actually want tobuy a bunch of gorillas, kangaroos and alligators, why notmake the zoo into a temporary game park? Encourage Japaneseand American businessmen to stalk and shoot whatever animalsthey choose, photograph them with their trophies, then takethe game away and &quot;give it to the poor to eat.&quot; The rarestspecies, &quot;strange birds, as well as flying foxes, koalas andcentipedes,&quot; should be kept for a great London gastronomicfestival, &quot;where Britons can taste delicacies from all overthe world, which they might otherwise miss from their life'sexperience.&quot;   ---   Mr. Levy is a staff journalist for the Observer in London.</TEXT></DOC>
