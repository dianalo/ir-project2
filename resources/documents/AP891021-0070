The Manila weather bureau said Elsie was packing winds of 127mph when it blew ashore Thursday but had since weakened to 75 mph.If Elsie maintains its westward course at 11 mph, it will hitHainan by Monday, said meteorologist Felio Bartolome.   A compilation of reports from the Red Cross and the military'sOffice of Civil Defense showed 10 people died in Isabela province,four in Quirino province, two in La Union province and one inBenguet province. Most of the dead either drowned or were hit byfalling trees and flying galvanized iron roofing.   Officials added 15 people were injured and more than 326,800others were taking temporary refuge in government shelters. Morethan 5,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged, they added.   Capt. Donna Eggleston, a U.S. Air Force spokeswoman, said ClarkAir Base had minimal damage as Typhoon Elsie spared Pampangaprovince, 50 miles north of Manila, from the brunt of itsdestructive winds.   Wallace Air Station, a joint Philippine-U.S. air defense radarcomplex in La Union, suffered damages worth $20,000 and the restand recreation facility, Camp John Hay, had about $10,000 indamage, mostly caused by detached roofs.   Officials said many northern provinces lost electricity whenhigh winds toppled power lines. Fallen trees littered the nationalhighway and blocked dozens of other roads.   Civil defense said Elsie's winds caused two tugboats to sink anda British-registered yacht to slam into port at La Union's PoroPoint, but there were no immediate reports of casualties on thevessels.   An average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike thePhilippines annually. Elsie is the 17th this year.   Manila newspapers reported today that U.S. pop-rock star CyndiLauper, who was in Manila last week for a two-day concert, lastSunday donated $2,300 to typhoon victims.
