These proposed regulationswould control lead and copper in drinking water that is due both to theiroccurrence in source waters and to the corrosion of lead and copper plumbingmaterials by water. EPA is proposing an MCLG of zero for lead and an MCLGof 1.3 mg/l for copper. For both lead and copper, EPA is proposing an NPDWRconsisting of a treatment technique requirement which would require optimalcorrosion control to minimize lead and copper as corrosion by-productsand public education to reduce exposure to lead as a corrosion by-product.In addition, EPA is proposing NPDWRs specifying maximum contaminant levels(MCLs) for lead and copper in water entering the distribution system, afterany treatment: 0.005 mg/l for lead and 1.3 mg/l for copper. EPA is alsosoliciting comment on alternatives to some of these proposals related totreatment requirements, monitoring, and lead pipe replacement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments should be submitted by October 17, 1988.Public hearings will be held at the addresses indicated below under ``<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>'' on September 28 (and 29, if necessary), 1988 in Washington,DC; on October 3 (and 4, if necessary), 1988 in Chicago, IL; and on October6 (and 7, if necessary), in Seattle, WA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The Agency will hold public hearings on the proposalat three different locations indicated below:<ITAG tagnum="15">1.

Statutory Requirements  </ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f <T3>et seq.) </T3>(``SDWA'' or ``the Act'') requires EPA to establish maximumcontaminant level goals (MCLGs) and national primary drinking water regulations(NPDWRs) for contaminants which, in the judgment of the Administrator,may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and which are knownor anticipated to occur in public water systems. Section 1412(b)(3)(A).MCLGs and MCLs are to be proposed and promulgated simultaneously. Section1412(b)(1).  MCLGs are Non-enforceable Health Goals  MCLGs are to be set at a level at which, in the Administrator's judgment,``no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occurand which allows an adequate margin of safety.'' Section 1412(b)(4). TheHouse Report on the bill that eventually became the SDWA of 1974 providesCongressional guidance on developing MCLGs:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he recommended maximum contaminant level [renamed maximum contaminantlevel goal in the 1986 amendments to the SDWA] must be set to prevent theoccurrence of any known or anticipated adverse effect. It must includean adequate margin of safety, unless there is no safe threshold for a contaminant.In such a case, the recommended maximum contaminant level should be setat the zero level. (H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185, Pg. 20, 1974)  </ITAG>NPDWRs Set the Enforceable Standards  NPDWRs include either MCLs or treatment technique requirements as wellas compliance monitoring requirements. Section 1401(1). A treatment techniquerequirement can be set only if ``it is not economically or technologicallyfeasible to ascertain the level of the contaminant.'' Section 1412(b)(7)(A).The MCL for a contaminant must be set as close to the MCLG as is ``feasible.''Section 1412(b)(4). Feasible means ``feasible with the use of the besttechnology, treatment techniques and other means, which the Administratorfinds after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solelyunder laboratory conditions are available (taking costs into consideration.)''Section 1412(b)(5). A treatment technique must ``prevent known or anticipatedadverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible.'' Section1412(b)(7)(A).  Secondary MCLs  EPA sets national secondary drinking water regulations (NSDWRs) to controlwater color, odor, appearance, and other characteristics affecting consumeracceptance of water. The secondary regulations are not federally enforceable,but are considered guidelines for the States. Section 1401(2).  Amendments to the SDWA  The 1986 amendments to the SDWA established a list of 83 contaminants forwhich EPA is to develop MCLGs and NPDWRs. Lead and copper are among thesecontaminants, and this proposed rule is the first step in fulfilling thisstatutory requirement for lead and copper in drinking water.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background  </ITAG>A. Regulatory Background  The current MCL for lead is 0.050 mg/l (see 40 CFR 141.11(b)). EPA promulgatedthis MCL as an interim drinking water regulation in 1975. For copper, thereis currently a NSDWR of 1 mg/l. On November 13, 1985, EPA began the processof revising the standards for lead and copper by proposing MCLGs for them(50 FR 46936, November 13, 1985). Because the 1986 amendments to the SDWArequire that MCLGs and NPDWRs be proposed and promulgated simultaneously,EPA must repropose MCLGs for contaminants for which MCLGs were originallyproposed in the November 1985 notice, including lead and copper, when itproposes the corresponding NPDWRs. Accordingly, this notice, which proposesNPDWRs for lead and copper, also reproposes MCLGs for these contaminants.The MCLG proposed for lead in this notice (zero) is lower than the MCLGfor lead proposed in November 1985. The MCLG proposed for copper is thesame as that proposed in 1985 (1.3 mg/l).  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Lead  </ITAG>The November 1985 notice proposed an MCLG for lead of 0.020 mg/l. Thisgoal was based on an assessment of data on adverse health effects of leadon infants. The assessment concluded that blood lead levels of 15 to 20ug/dl represented levels of concern for infants. Effects of lead foundat these levels are discussed in detail in the November 1985 notice; morerecent data on these and other effects are discussed below. The 1985 proposedMCLG of 0.020 mg/l for lead in water assumed that 15 ug/dl was the bloodlead level of concern for infants, assumed that infants receive 100 percentof their lead exposure from drinking water, and used a factor of 0.16 ug/dlper ug/l lead to correlate water lead levels to blood lead levels (i.e.,every 1 ug/l lead in drinking water was estimated to contribute about 0.16ug/dl to a child's blood lead level). An uncertainty factor of 5 was usedin the calculation to account for uncertainty in the data and provide amargin of safety.There also are several positive carcinogenicity bioassays using differentlead salts. Therefore, in the November 1985 notice, EPA classified leadas a Group B2 carcinogen (probable human carcinogen) according to the draftEPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (since promulgated as finalguidelines at 51 FR 33992, September 24, 1986). However, the proposed MCLGwas not based on the carcinogenicity data because the doses used in thestudies were much higher than the overt toxicity levels in humans, andbecause several epidemiology studies did not show an association betweencancer and lead exposure in occupationally exposed workers.In addition to directing EPA to revise the NPDWR for lead, the SDWA includesother provisions that affect lead contamination of drinking water. The1986 SDWA amendments banned the use of lead solder or flux (i.e., solderor flux containing more than 0.2 percent lead) and lead-bearing pipes andfittings (i.e., pipes and fittings containing more than 8 percent lead).Section 1417. The lead ban was effective June 19, 1986. States were requiredto implement and enforce the lead ban as of June 19, 1988. EPA is developinga program to withhold 5 percent of Federal grants for drinking water implementationfrom States that fail to enforce the ban.The SDWA also imposes special public notification requirements regardinglead in drinking water. Section 1417(a)(2). Public water systems are requiredto identify and provide notice to persons who may be affected by lead contaminationin their drinking water, when such contamination results from either theuse of lead in the construction materials of the system and/or corrosivityof the water supply sufficient to cause lead leaching from plumbing systems.This provision requires notification even if the system is in compliancewith the current MCL for lead. EPA published final regulations to implementthis requirement of the SDWA on October 28, 1987 (52 FR 41534). Under theseregulations, systems were required to begin providing notice to consumersby June 19, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Copper</ITAG>EPA proposed an MCLG of 1.3 mg/l for copper in the November 13, 1985 notice.This value was based on short-term effects of copper on humans at relativelyhigh doses; no long-term effects at lower exposure levels have been predicted.No new data have become available since November 1985 that have alteredEPA's evaluation of the health effects of copper.B. Overview of Problem<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Lead</ITAG>Lead occurs in drinking water from two sources: (1) Lead in raw water supplies,i.e., source water, and (2) corrosion of plumbing materials in the waterdistribution system. Most of the lead in drinking water is a result ofcorrosion by water of plumbing materials containing lead.EPA estimates that approximately 900 public water systems (or andless;1 percentof the community water systems in the country) may have water leaving thewater supply plant that has greater than 0.005 mg/l lead. In fact, somesystems deliver water to customers that exceeds the current MCL of 0.050mg/l. Because of concern about low level exposures to lead, as describedin Section III.B.1. below, lead in source water even at low levels maybe an important contributor to lead in drinking water in some systems.Lead in drinking water as a by-product of corrosion results primarily fromcorrosion of plumbing materials in the distribution system and in buildings.The amount of lead in drinking water due to corrosion depends on a numberof factors, including the amount and age of lead material present in thesystem to be corroded and the degree of corrosivity of the water.As illustrated in Figure 1, potential sources of lead in drinking waterdistribution systems (including plumbing in buildings) include:andbullet; Water service mains (rarely);andbullet; Lead goosenecks or pigtails (short sections of pipe leading fromthe water main to the meter or main portion of the service line, and whichis genrally 6-8 feet long);andbullet; Lead service lines and interior household pipes;andbullet; Lead solders and fluxes used to connect copper pipes; andandbullet; Alloys containing lead, including some faucets made of brass orbronze.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2541</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>Most public water systems serve at least some buildings with lead solderand EPA estimates that there are about 4.4 million lead service lines stillin use in the U.S. About 25 percent of water suppliers have some lead servicelines within their distribution system (EPA, 1987a). Lead service linesand interior plumbing are significant potential sources of lead in drinkingwater and can contribute large amounts of lead to water for the life ofthe pipe. Lead solder can contribute large amounts of lead to water forup to five years after installation, and longer if exposed to corrosivewater (EPA 1986a). In addition, brass and bronze in faucets and fixturescan contain lead and there is evidence that they can be an important sourceof lead in drinking water that stands in the fixtures.The amount of lead in drinking water also depends on the corrosivity ofthe water. All water is corrosive to metal plumbing materials to some degree,even water termed non-corrosive or water treated to make it less corrosive.The corrosivity of water to lead is influenced largely by the pH and totalalkalinity of the water (water with low pH and/or low alkalinity wateris more corrosive to lead than water with high pH and alkalinity). Galvaniccorrosion of lead into water also occurs with lead-soldered copper pipes,due to differences in the electrochemical potential of the two metals.Grounding of household electrical systems to plumbing can exacerbate galvaniccorrosion. There are other factors that also may affect water corrosivity,such as water temperature (seasonal variations in lead levels are common),and levels of free chlorine, total dissolved solids, and oxygen.Lead levels in drinking water can vary considerably from system to system,among houses supplied by the same system, among different taps in the samehouse, and at different times of the day at a single tap. Factors thataffect lead levels in water independent of the corrosivity of water include:andbullet; The number and age of lead-soldered joints in the building andthe quality of workmanship of the joints (new solder releases high amountsof lead and sloppy solder joints have more lead available to be leached);andbullet; The contact time between the water and the lead (longer contacttime results in higher lead levels so, for instance, morning first drawwater samples have higher lead levels than samples with shorter standingtimes or flushed water samples); andandbullet; The length and diameter of the lead service line (longer linesgenerally result in higher lead levels in water at the tap since the wateris in contact with more lead, while smaller diameter pipes have a greaterratio of pipe surface to water volume so there is more contact betweenthe lead and water which can result in higher lead levels, and small diameterpipes can also result in higher lead levels because of increased velocityof the water flow which causes scouring of the sides of the pipe).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Copper</ITAG>The primary source of copper in drinking water is corrosion of copper pipes,which are widely used throughout the U.S. for interior plumbing of residencesand other buildings; copper in source water is a problem for very few watersupplies. In some cases, copper is a component of additives to drinkingwater used by suppliers to control the growth of algae. EPA estimates thatonly 66 water suppliers would need to install treatment to reduce copperin source water to the MCLG (EPA, 1988a).Like lead in drinking water, the occurrence of copper in drinking waterresulting from corrosion when copper is present in the distribution system,including interior plumbing, depends on the corrosivity of the water. Also,as with lead, all water is corrosive to copper to some degree. Corrosivitytoward copper depends primarily on the pH of the water, with very low pHsassociated with the highest levels of copper in water due to corrosion.Free chlorine levels also affect corrosion of copper; higher chlorine residuallevels increase copper corrosion (Stone et al., 1987; Reiber et al., 1987;EPA, 1987b). Dissolved carbon dioxide and oxygen can also contribute tocopper corrosion (Cohen and Meyers, 1987).Many of the other factors that affect the corrosivity of water towardslead can also be expected to affect the corrosion of copper. For instance,flow rate, standing time, water temperature, and length of copper pipecan affect copper levels in drinking water (Maessen et al., 1985). Thereare few data on whether age of plumbing affects copper corrosion rates(EPA, 1987b; Rieber et al., 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. MCLGs for Lead and Copper </ITAG>A. Exposure <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Exposure to Lead </ITAG>a. <T3>General. </T3>Assessing actual human exposure to lead is difficultdue to the variability of lead levels at the tap and the existence of otherexposure sources. As described above, water lead levels at any one tapvary throughout the day, and vary among taps with constant standing timesdue to differences in the amount of available lead to which the water isexposed. People are exposed to lead from a variety of sources in addition to water,including food, air, and dust; the proportion of total exposure attributableto drinking water varies by individual. The typical drinking water contributionto total lead exposure for an average two-year-old child is estimated tobe about 20 percent (EPA, 1988b), but this varies with different levelsof lead in the water and with variations in other lead exposures, and canrange from about five to 30 percent of total intake. For children withextraordinary exposures, such as those exposed to deteriorating lead paint,including paint chips or leaded-paint dust, or living near lead smeltersor other point sources of airborne lead, those sources predominate anddrinking water contributes a much lower, although still relevant, proportionof total exposure. For residents of buildings with new lead solder servedwith corrosive water, drinking water can be the primary source of exposure.b. <T3>Exposure to Lead Through Drinking Water. </T3>The magnitude of humanexposure resulting from the ingestion of lead in drinking water dependsupon many factors. Patterns of consumption may vary among individuals,from those who flush taps before drinking to those who drink first flushwater. There are few actual data on individual water consumption patterns(i.e., percent consumption of standing and flushed water) and the leadexposures that result from them. EPA is conducting a pilot study of drinkingwater consumption patterns which may provide additional data on this questionfor use in developing the final MCLG and enforceable standards. However,these data are not yet available. The problem of assessing exposure from drinking water can be addressedby bracketing exposures. Assuming that an adult consumes two liters ofwater (one liter for children) per day from the same water supplier, morningfirst draw samples (or service connection samples if the service connectionis lead) will represent a case of high exposure and fully flushed sampleswill represent the minimum exposure. For example, in a home where fullyflushed samples are consistently 0.005 mg/l and morning first draw (orservice connection) samples are consistently 0.010 mg/l, the occupantswill have actual lead intake from drinking water of 0.005-0.010 mg/l, ora total of 0.010-0.020 mg/day for adults. Patterson (EPA, 1981) conducted a national study of lead levels in drinkingwater. Random daytime grab samples from taps that had been flushed for30 seconds were collected from 580 cities in 47 states. While 30-secondflushed random grab samples are not necessarily representative of actualhuman exposure, EPA believes that they are more representative of waterconsumed in the U.S. than are fully flushed samples since many people regularlyconsume some morning first draw water. Because these data portray neitheran upper bound of exposure (morning first draw or lead service line samplelevels) nor a lower bound of exposure (fully flushed) levels, they maymore closely portray actual average exposure. Therefore, these data provideinsight as to the magnitude of lead exposure via drinking water. In thePatterson study, which used a reporting limit of 0.010 mg/l, the nationalmean lead level in water was 0.029 mg/l. The midwest had the highest meanlead level (0.047 mg/l) and the south-central portion of the country hadthe lowest mean lead level (0.012 mg/l). The median value for the U.S.and for all of the regions of the country identified in the analysis wasthe reporting limit, 0.010 mg/l. An EPA analysis of the benefits of regulatinglead in drinking water used these data to estimate that 42 million peoplein the U.S. may be exposed to lead levels in water of 0.020 mg/l or greater(EPA, 1986a). As discussed in Section III.B. below, the toxic effects of lead are correlatedwith blood lead levels rather than lead exposure levels or intake amounts.Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between leadintake and blood lead levels. Many investigators have attempted to correlateblood lead levels with drinking water lead levels and estimate the contributionof water lead to blood lead levels. Several of these studies correlatedmorning first draw water lead levels with blood lead levels (U.K. Dept.of Environment, 1982; Thomas et al., 1979). Other studies correlate standingrandom daytime grab sample water lead levels with blood lead levels (Worthet al., 1981; Moore, 1977). While neither morning first draw nor standingrandom daytime grab data is a better predicator of blood lead level thanthe other, of the currently available data, both are better than fullyflushed samples (EPA, 1986b). Duplicate diet studies by Ryu (1983) andLacey et al. (1985) have correlated measured lead intake with blood leadlevels, and can also be used to predict blood lead levels. EPA has useda correlation coefficient of 0.20 ug/dl per ug/1 derived from these lasttwo studies to relate lead levels in drinking water to blood lead levels(EPA, 1988c). c. <T3>Non-Drinking Water Exposures to Lead. </T3>There are several sourcesof lead exposure in addition to drinking water. Directly inhaled airbornelead and lead that settles out to dust and dirt from the air are importantsources, especially for children who tend to play in the dirt and who oftenput their hands in their mouths. Other important sources of lead are airdeposition on food crops, leaching to food from lead soldered cans, andin the case of exceptionally high exposures, lead paint. Lead in air arises from industrial emissions and combustion of leaded gasolinein cars. EPA estimates that average urban air lead levels ranged between0.2-0.4 ug/m3 in 1986 (EPA, 1988d). Much higher levels are found in areasnear stationary lead sources such as smelters and battery plants. Ingestion of leaded paint chips and dust accounts for most of the reportedcases of overt lead poisoning in children. Many local community healthprograms (especially in urban areas) screen the blood lead levels of childrenand identify high risk housing (i.e., those houses likely to have deterioratinglead paint) and assist with remediation of lead paint problems. Food is also a source of lead exposure. Lead can contaminate food by uptakefrom soil, direct deposition on crops from the air, or use of lead solderto seal cans (especially with acidic foods such as tomatoes). The Foodand Drug Administration has recommended the use of non-lead soldered cansfor baby foods and encourages food processors to eliminate the use of lead-solderedcans for all foods. In the U.S., no baby foods are currently sold in lead-solderedcans and most domestic can manufacturers have voluntarily converted tolead-free cans for other foods as well. In addition, lead can contaminatefood in the handling, transportation or preparation stages. Finally, foodprepared with water, either in manufacturing or at home, can be contaminatedby lead from the drinking water.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has compileda report to Congress on lead hazards and exposures of children (ATSDR,1988). The ATSDR report reviews the non-drinking water sources of leadexposure in greater detail than is presented here. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Exposure to Copper </ITAG>Human exposure to copper results from a variety of sources, including drinkingwater. As described earlier, copper in drinking water occurs primarilyas a result of the corrosion of copper plumbing pipes, although some copperoccurs in raw water. Patterson (EPA, 1981) measured copper levels in the 30-second flushed randomdaytime grab samples described above. In that survey, 3 percent of 772samples exceeded 1 mg/l of copper and 19 percent exceeded 0.2 mg/l. Thenational average level of copper in water was 0.221 mg/l (median 0.04 mg/l),the south central U.S. had the lowest average levels (0.082, median, 0.02mg/l), and the northeast had the highest average levels (0.526 mg/l; median,0.06 mg/l). Exposure to copper can also come through air and food. In a 1966 NationalAir Sampling Network survey, copper levels in the air were 0.01 and 0.26andCx.18;g/m\3\ in rural and urban areas, respectively (U.S. Dept. of Health,Education, and Welfare, 1968). Airborne copper levels near copper smelterscan range up to 2 andCx.18;g/m\3\, but even these high levels contributeonly about 1 percent of normal daily intake. Copper is found in shellfishand organ meats, nuts, and dried legumes; dried vine and stone fruits andcocoa are especially rich in copper. Copper levels can range up to 400andCx.18;g/g in these foods (50 FR 46967, Nov. 13, 1985). B. Toxicity <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Health Effects of Lead </ITAG>As noted above, the health effects of lead are generally correlated withPbB levels. Lead exposure across a broad range of blood lead (PbB) levelsis associated with a continuum of pathophysiological effects, includinginterference with heme synthesis necessary for formation of red blood cells,anemia, kidney damage, impaired reproductive function, interference withvitamin D metabolism, impaired cognitive performance (as measured by IQtests, performance in school, and other means), delayed neurological andphysical development, and elevations in blood pressure (EPA, 1986b). At this time, it is difficult to identify clearly what PbB level is anappropriate criterion or ``threshold'' below which there are no or onlyminimal risks of adverse health effects. Although there is some uncertaintyregarding the point at which subtle biochemical or other changes combineto cause a discernable adverse effect on organs or systems in the body,effects clearly become more pronounced and broaden to cause more severedisruptions of the normal functioning of many organ systems as PbB levelsincrease. The following considerations are important in determining a targetPbB of concern to be used in setting an MCLG. PbB levels above 30 andCx.18;g/dl in young children are associated with clearlydeleterious effects in several organ systems (EPA, 1986b). These includereduced hemoglobin synthesis (at 40 andCx.18;g/dl), frank anemia (at 70 andCx.18;g/dl),peripheral neuropathies (at 60 andCx.18;g/dl), encephalopathy (at 80-100andCx.18;g/dl), and in some cases, death. At levels below 25-30 ug/dl, many different, less obvious effects indicateinterference by lead with normal physiological processes. The onset ofsigns of detectable heme synthesis impairment in many different organ systemsoccurs at PbB levels starting around 10-15 andCx.18;g/dl, along with indicationsof pyrimidine and vitamin D metabolism interference and signs of alterednervous system activity (EPA, 1986b). Evidence also indicated that fetal exposure at PbB levels around 10-15andCx.18;g/dl is associated with delays in early mental and physical development(EPA, 1986b; Davis and Svendsgaard, 1987). In adults, several studies have found a small but consistent relationshipbetween blood lead levels and blood pressure, with some indications ofa continuous relationship down to the lowest levels measured. The bloodpressure increases may be associated with some increased risk for moreserious cardiovascular disease events, especially if PbB levels are chronicallyelevated (EPA, 1986a). Some of the important effects of low-level lead exposures are: 1. Inhibition of pyrimidine-5-nucleotidase (Py-5-N) and delta-aminolevulinicacid dehydrase (ALA-D) activity, which appears to begin at a PbB levelof 10 andCx.18;g/dl or below (Angle et al., 1982). Hernberg and Nikkanen(1970) found 50 percent inhibition of ALA-D activity at PbB levels above16 andCx.18;g/dl. Inhibition of erythrocyte ALA-D appears to occur at virtuallyall blood lead levels measured so far, with no evident threshold (EPA,1986b). Inhibition of ALA-D activity is manifested in increased levelsof aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in blood and soft tissue, which appear tooccur at PbB levels of about 40 andCx.18;g/dl (O'Flaherty et al., 1980) andmay occur at levels as low as 18 andCx.18;g/dl (Meredith et al., 1978). Severalstudies indicate that increases of ALA in the brain interfere with thegamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system in various ways(EPA, 1986b). 2. Elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in red blood cellsoccurs at PbB levels as low as 15 andCx.18;g/dl. This probably indicatesa general interference in heme synthesis throughout the body, includinginterference in the functioning of mitochondria (Piomelli et al., 1980).Changes in heme metabolism have been reported perinatally at blood leadlevels of 8-10 andCx.18;g/dl (Lauwerys et al., 1978). Some studies that accountedfor iron status show that children with low iron stores are more sensitiveto lead in terms of heme biosynthesis interference (e.g., Mahaffey andAnnest, 1986).   3. Interference with vitamin D metabolism has been associated with leadexposure with no apparent threshold down to the lowest PbB level measured(12 ug/dl) in studies by Rosen et al. (1980) and Mahaffey et al. (1982).4. Correlations between lead exposure and changes in electrophysiologicalfunctioning of the nervous system have also been reported. These includecorrelations with: Changes in slow-wave electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns,increased latencies in brainstem auditory evoked potentials (Otto et al.,1981, 1982, 1985), and slowed nerve conduction in the auditory pathwayassociated with PbB levels with no clearly discernable threshold apparentdown to 6 ug/dl (Schwartz and Otto, 1987). Also, peripheral nerve conductionvelocities have been shown to be slowed in children, with significant correlationat PbB levels above 20 ug/dl (Landrigan et al., 1976; Schwartz et al.,1988).5. As stated in recent reviews (Davis and Svendsgaard, 1987; EPA, 1986b),evidence from longitudinal studies in several different communities consistentlyindicates that perinatal exposure to blood lead levels as low as 10-15ug/dl, and possibly lower, is linked to delays in early cognitive and physicaldevelopment. Four independent studies show an association between maternalor cord blood lead levels at birth and reduced performance on a standardindex of infant mental development through two years of age (e.g., Bellingeret al., 1984, 1987; Dietrich et al., 1987; Baghurst et al., 1987; Wolfet al., 1985). In addition, birth weight and the length of gestation appearto be reduced in prenatally lead-exposed infants in some of these studies(e.g., Dietrich et al., 1987; Bornschein et al., 1988; McMichael et al.,1986). Analyses also suggest that growth and stature are reduced in olderchildren with PbB levels ranging from 5 to 35 ug/dl (Schwartz et al., 1986),with supporting evidence from other studies of children at higher PbB levels(Lauwerys et al., 1986) and of experimental animals (Grant et al., 1980).Other aspects of physical development may also be disturbed by prenatallead exposure (Davis and Svendsgaard, 1987; EPA, 1986b).6. Recent studies of IQ effects in black children of uniformly low socioeconomicstatus (SES), so that SES was not a confounder, have shown a highly significantassociation between IQ and blood lead across a range of 6 to 47 ug/dl (Schroederet al., 1985; Schroeder and Hawk, 1987). Other recent cross sectional studiesalso provide consistent evidence of IQ deficits in children at PbB levelsbelow 25 ug/dl (Fulton et al., 1987; Hatzakis et al., 1987).Finally, based on the weight of evidence, EPA has classified lead as aprobable human carcinogen (Group B2), because some lead compounds causereal tumors in experimental animals (EPA, 1988e). EPA (1986b) noted thatlead may act as a promoter or initiator of carcinogenesis and that <T3>in vitro </T3>studies support the genotoxic and carcinogenic role oflead. However, EPA recommends that quantitative estimates of the carcinogenicpotency of lead not be used for the purpose of risk assessment, becauseof the considerable uncertainty in the estimates. As EPA has stated previously,``lead has been observed to increase tumorigenesis rates in animals onlyat relatively high concentrations, and therefore it does not appear tobe a potent carcinogen.'' (EPA, 1986b). At low levels, the non-cancer effectsof lead are of greatest concern for regulatory purposes.In reviewing the information presented in the Agency's 1986 Air QualityCriteria Document, EPA's Clean Air Science Advisory Committee concludedthat the various effects starting at PbB levels around 10-15 ug/dl or evenlower in young children ``may be argued as becoming biomedically adverse''(EPA, 1986c).Although no threshold is apparent for various measures of lead toxicity,some distinction can be made between PbB levels where risks of effectsappear more likely (10-15 ug/dl and higher) and levels where risks areless certain (below 10-15 ug/dl). Therefore, 10-15 ug/dl constitutes anappropriate range of concern for health effects that warrant avoidance.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Health Effects of Copper</ITAG>The health effects of copper were discussed in detail in EPA's 1985 MCLGproposal (50 FR 46967, November 13, 1985). No new relevant informationon the health effects of copper that alters the conclusions reached inthat notice has become available. The information presented in the November1985 notice is summarized here.Copper is toxic to humans at high levels and is nutritionally essentialat lower doses. Acute exposure to high copper levels in test animals andhumans can cause gastrointestinal distrubances, liver damage, renal damage,hemolytic anemia, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) inhibition.Chronic toxicity data are limited.Two groups are at increased risk from copper exposure. Individuals withWilson's disease, an inborn error in copper metabolism, are at higher riskthan the general public. The metabolic error in Wilson's disease allowscopper to accumulate in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, causing hemolyticanemia, neurological abnormalities, and corneal opacity. In addition, individualswith existing G6PD deficiencies may also be at greater risk of experiencingtoxic effects from copper exposure.On the other hand, copper is regarded as nutritionally essential becauseit is required in many enzymatic reactions in mammals. Copper deficiencycan result in decreased iron absorption and iron deficiency, and may alsolead to reproductive abnormalities. The National Academy of Sciences hasrecommended 2-3 mg/day copper as a safe and adequate intake (NAS, 1980).Copper is classified in EPA's Group D (insufficient data) for carcinogenicpotential. Copper is generally negative in mutagenicity bioassays and copperproduced equivocal results in carcinogenicity bioassays. Bioassays usingoral copper were negative; subcutaneous injection of copper compounds hasbeen reported to induce tumor formation in one sex and strain of mice.C. Development of the MCLGs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. MCLG for Lead</ITAG>EPA is proposing to set the MCLG for lead at zero, based on subtle effectsat low blood lead levels, the overall Agency goal of reducing total leadexposures, and probable carcinogenicity at very high doses. Specifically,the basis for proposing the MCLG at zero is:1. The occurrence of a variety of low level effects for which it is currentlydifficult to identify clear threshold PbB levels below which there areno risks of adverse health effects;2. The Agency policy goal that drinking water should contribute minimallead to total lead exposures because a substantial portion of the sensitivepopulation already exceeds acceptable blood lead levels; and3. The classification of lead as a Group B2 (probable human) carcinogen.As discussed above, effects of concern have been associated with bloodlead levels beginning at 10-15 ug/dl in adults, children, and fetuses.Below 10 ug/dl, biochemical and other cellular level effects of questionablehealth significance have been reported. Therefore, for purposes of thisregulation, EPA considers 10-15 ug/dl to be an appropriate range of concernfor health effects that warrant avoidance.Lead affects a wide range of organ systems; it can adversely affect theblood, the nervous system, normal growth and development, the kidneys,the reproductive system, and the cardiovascular system. An MCLG of zerois appropriate because there are no clearly discernable thresholds forsome of these effects.Another reason for setting the MCLG at zero is the fact that a portionof the population most sensitive to lead effects already has blood leadlevels above the levels that pose a risk of causing some adverse effects.Although average blood lead levels are expected to be near 4-6 ug/dl inchildren in 1990 when this rule would take effect (EPA, 1988f), many individualchildren would still have PbB levels above 10 ug/dl (excluding childrenwith lead paint/pica exposures, whose exposure from those sources overwhelmsexposure from other sources), the lower bound of the range of concern.Because many children now have blood lead levels above the level of concern,EPA's policy goal is that drinking water contribute minimal additionallead to existing body burdens of lead.Finally, EPA reviewed data on lead's potential carcinogenicity in determiningthe appropriate MCLG. Although difficulties in evaluating the dose-responsedata for lead prevent estimation of its carcinogenic potency, the datanonetheless clearly indicate that lead is carcinogenic in test animals.As explained by EPA in adopting MCLGs for other carcinogenic contaminants,the Agency does not believe that a threshold exists for carcinogenic effects(50 FR 46894, November 13, 1985). EPA therefore believes that, for carcinogens,zero is the level at which no known or anticipated effects occur with anadequate margin of safety, and EPA has established a policy of settingMCLGs at zero for compounds classified as Group A or B carcinogens. Settingthe MCLG for lead at zero is consistent with that policy.EPA has received a request from Multinational Business Services, Inc. (``MBS'')to reconsider the Agency's policy of establishing MCLGs of zero for carcinogensand instead establish MCLGs for carcinogenic contaminants at calculatednegligible risk levels. EPA considered adopting finite, risk-based MCLGswhen it promulgated MCLGs for five carcinogenic volatile organic chemicalsin (VOCs) 1985. EPA decided that, given the nonthreshold nature of carcinogeniceffects, the zero MCLG option best fulfilled the mandate of the SDWA toestablish MCLGs ``at the level at which no known or anticipated adverseeffects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate marginof safety.'' See 49 FR 24347-24348 (June 12, 1984) and 50 FR 46895-46896(November 13, 1985). The Agency's decision to set MCLGs of zero for thesefive contaminants was upheld in <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v. <T3>Thomas,</T3> 824 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir., 1987).In its request, MBS contends that the recent decision by the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 824 F.2d 1146 (1987) (``<T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>''), which construed the Agency's duties under section112 of the Clean Air Act, applies to the establishment of MCLGs under theSDWA.The Agency does not believe that the court's analysis in <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> must be applied to the setting of MCLGs. That decisionconstrued the specific language of section 112 of the Clean Air Act andthe legislative history of that provision. Section 1412 of the SDWA differsfrom section 112 of the Clean Air Act both in terms of its language andlegislative history. Furthermore, the role of the MCLG as a non-enforceablehealth goal, the first step in the process of determining the enforceableMCL or treatment technique, is unique to the SDWA. In light of the distinctionsbetween section 112 of the Clean Air Act and section 1412 of the SDWA,the Agency does not believe that following the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> analysis in setting MCLGs is either necessary orappropriate. For these reasons, and the reasons described in the VOC rulemaking,EPA believes at this time that it is appropriate to set MCLGs for nonthresholdcontaminants at zero. Nonetheless, the Agency has included the requestsubmitted by Multinational Business Services in the record for this rulemaking,and the Agency intends to fully address that submission and any relatedcomments when the Agency publishes the final MCLG for lead.<T3>Public Comments: </T3>In 1985, a total of eight individuals and organizationscommented on the proposed MCLG of 0.02 mg/l for lead. The public commentsand EPA's responses are summarized below:<T3>Comment Summary: </T3>Some commenters stated that the proposed MCLGof 0.02 mg/l for lead was appropriate. There was some disagreement amongthe commenters on whether an uncertainty factor of 5 or 10 (which wouldyield an MCLG of 0.01 mg/l) should be used.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>For the reasons outlined above, EPA is now proposingan MCLG of zero for lead and so a discussion of what the safety factorwould be is much less relevant than when a non-zero MCLG was proposed.The National Academy of Sciences and others suggest that a safety factorof 10 should be used when extrapolating from data obtained in human epidemiologystudies to the general population. This was meant to address well-defined,known toxic endpoints. The endpoints in the case of lead exposure are extremelysubtle enzymic and physiologic occurrences, and are not comparable to thetraditional toxic endpoints. There is considerably less uncertainty abouthealth effects from lead than from any other chemical. Excellent humandata are available. Therefore, there is less need to apply the usual uncertaintyfactors in this case and a lower uncertainty factor is appropriate.<T3>Comment Summary: </T3>Some commenters disagreed with the MCLG of 0.02mg/l proposed for lead. One maintained that it has not been proven thatlow level lead exposure has adverse health effects and, therefore, thepresent level of 0.05 mg/l is fully protective and should not be decreased.Another commenter stated that since the primary sources of lead exposureare air and dust, available funds should be spent on reducing exposurefrom sources such as leaded gasoline and lead-based paint rather than drinkingwater, and cited a study by Morse et al. (1979) in support of the contentionthat drinking water lead does not increase blood lead levels.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA disagrees that low level lead exposure doesnot pose a health risk. The literature reviewed by this commenter is cursoryand very selective, and only literature supportive of the commenter's perspectivewas included in the comment. EPA has reviewed and evaluated all relevantliterature. In the November 1985 proposal, the Agency cited the Ryu etal. (1983) study as being the appropriate study to determine the effectsof low level lead exposure on blood levels in infants, the most vulnerablesubpopulation. In addition, EPA has reviewed further studies, discussedabove, which also support the conclusion that there are adverse healthrisks at low level exposure levels.EPA agrees that lead exposure from air, dust, and paint are important.These exposures are being addressed by other agencies such as the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, and within EPA by other offices suchas the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR). The study by Morse, et al. (1979)concluded that increased concentrations (over source water levels) of leadin soft, acidic drinking water are transported by distribution pipes. Whilethe authors concluded that they could determine no level of drinking waterlead that would increase blood lead levels, the data base was too smallto produce statistically valid results. In addition, the average bloodlead level in both the control group and the case group of children sixyears old and younger both exceeded 15 ug/dl. The blood lead levels ofthe one- and two-year-olds was andCx.170;20 mg/dl. When blood lead levelsare high, the relationship between blood lead and water lead appears tobe relatively obscured by the higher body burden, in both the study andthe control groups.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. MCLG for Copper</ITAG>EPA proposed an MCLG of 1.3 mg/l for copper in the November 1985 notice.As noted above, no new data that change the conclusions presented in thatnotice have become available since its publication. EPA is, therefore,reproposing an MCLG of 1.3 mg/l for copper.The proposed MCLG of 1.3 mg/l for adults and children was based on a LowestObserved Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) of 5.3 mg/day from human clinicalcase studies in which 5.3 mg was the lowest acute oral dose at which gastrointestinaleffects were seen (Chuttani et al., 1965). An uncertainty factor of twowas applied, and daily consumption of 2 liters of water per day by an adultwas assumed. Ten-day and longer exposure values were not derived becausethe data were inadequate.<T3>Public Comments: </T3>Fourteen individuals and organizations commentedon the MCLG proposed for copper in 1985. Several commenters agreed thatit was reasonable to use short-term toxicity data as the basis for theproposed MCLG of 1.3 mg/l.Several commenters thought that an MCLG for copper was unnecessary andthat it would be more appropriate to issue a health advisory for the contaminant.The reasons included: (1) Inadequate adverse health effects data, (2) limitedoccurrence of copper in drinking water, and (3) the fact that copper ispresent in drinking water due to corrosion of copper pipes; thus, treatmentat the water supply plant would not solve the problem of elevated copperconcentrations.<T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA does not agree that there are inadequate healtheffects data for regulating copper. The data indicate that copper is ahealth risk at levels above 1.3 mg/l in water (although it is beneficialat lower levels); acute exposure to copper has resulted in gastrointestinaleffects, such as nausea and diarrhea, as discussed in the 1985 proposaland above. EPA agrees that copper is not commonly found above the proposedMCLG, but high levels of copper have occasionally been detected in drinkingwater supplies across the country, and high levels of copper can leachfrom pipes in areas with corrosive water. Thus, EPA believes an MCLG andNPDWR are justified to protect against adverse health effects. In addition,Congress listed copper as one of 83 drinking water contaminants mandatedfor regulation in the 1986 amendments to the SDWA. Since EPA did not substituteanother contaminant in place of copper (as authorized by section 1412(b)(2)of the SDWA), it remains on the list of 83 contaminants for which EPA mustpromulgate an MCLG and NPDWR.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper</ITAG>A. Occurrence<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Occurrence of Lead and Copper in Source Water and Distributed Water</ITAG>a. <T3>Lead.</T3> There are several national surveys of lead occurrence inwater leaving the treatment plant and entering the distribution system(distributed water). Well water drawn for drinking water generally hasvery low lead concentrations. In a national drinking water survey of nearly1000 randomly chosen groundwater supplies completed in 1987 (the NationalInorganics and Radionuclides Survey or NIRS), about 5 percent of the drinkingwater samples collected from fully flushed taps exceeded 0.005 mg/l oflead (EPA, 1988g). However, recent samples taken to determine the effectof the measurement point on estimates of lead in distributed water indicatethat lead as a by-product of corrosion may enter fully flushed tap samplesand be attributed erroneously to source water. Therefore, EPA resampledthe supplies in NIRS that showed positive results for lead. EPA found veryfew samples above 0.005 mg/l of lead when the sampling point was movedto the entry point to the distribution system. Based on these new data,EPA estimates that approximately 900 groundwater suppliers (or 1 percentof the community and non-transient, non-community water systems) may havewater leaving the treatment plant that has greater than 0.005 mg/l lead(EPA 1988a).A significant portion of the total lead present in surface waters existsas part of the suspended solids. This portion comes from natural soil leadaugmented by atmospheric deposition and discharges by industrial and municipaldischarges to surface water. The level of lead in water drawn from riversand streams is slightly lower than the concentration found in groundwater.Eighty-six percent of the raw surface water samples analyzed by Fishmanand Hems (1976) contained less than 0.010 mg/l of lead and less than 1percent contained over 0.050 mg/l. However, the concentration of lead indistributed water from these sources may be much lower due to removal bytreatment, e.g., sedimentation, prior to distribution.The National Organic Monitoring Survey (NOMS, 1976) also provided dataon the quality of fully flushed water from surface water supplies. Thelevel of lead in the samples in this survey ranged from 1-10 mg/l.Based on this information, EPA estimates that about 99 percent of the 219million people in the United States using public water supplies (both surfaceand groundwater sources) are exposed to distributed water levels between0 and 0.005 mg/l, and that about 2 million people are served by distributedwater with levels of lead greater than 0.005 mg/l.b. <T3>Copper.</T3> Copper levels above the proposed MCLG are rarely foundin raw drinking water supplies or in distributed water. In the NIRS study(EPA, 1988g), which surveyed 983 randomly selected groundwater supplies,85 percent of all fully flushed tap samples had copper levels below 0.06mg/l; and 98 percent of such samples had copper levels below 0.46 mg/l.Less than 1 percent of the samples had copper levels above 1.0 mg/l. Themaximum value found was 2.37 mg/l. In the 1969 Community Water Supply Survey(CWSS), samples were taken from 678 groundwater supplies, 109 surface watersupplies, and 182 supplies of unknown or mixed origin (a total of 969 systems).For the groundwater supplies, the maximum copper level found was 0.47 mg/land the mean of the positive measurements (i.e., those exceeding the detectionlimit of 0.1 mg/l) was 0.075 mg/l. For the surface water supplies, themaximum copper value found was 0.304 mg/l, and the mean of the positivemeasurements was 0.066 mg/l. EPA estimates that only 66 water supplierswould need to install treatment to lower copper levels to the MCLG (EPA,1988a).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Occurrence of Lead and Copper as By-Products of Corrosion</ITAG>a. <T3>Lead.</T3> Even when water leaving the water treatment plant is relativelylead-free, pipes, solder, and fixtures containing lead are corroded bywater resulting in contamination of the water. Lead present in plumbingmaterials can be mobilized, resulting in significantly higher levels atthe user's tap than in the water leaving the treatment plant. Three factorsare particularly important in determining the degree of corrosion. First,the combination of copper pipes with solder containing lead found in mosthouseholds can result in elevated lead levels due to galvanic corrosion.Galvanic corrosion is especially important in the case of newly-installedsolder, which is particularly reactive. Therefore, people living in housingwith lead-soldered plumbing less than five years old are at risk of havinghigh levels of lead in drinking water. Second, the corrosivity of the watertowards lead is a major factor influencing the occurrence of lead as acorrosion by-product. Third, regardless of age, water that has been incontact with lead pipe or solder for a period of time will contain higherlead levels than flushed water from the same pipe.While the critical factors affecting lead levels in drinking water arewell recognized, there are not sufficient quantitative data available todetermine the national distribution of lead levels in drinking water atthe tap in much detail. EPA has some morning first draw data, but thesedata were not collected in a systematic fashion and are therefore not nationallyrepresentative of lead levels at the tap. For example, of the 40 individualcities which collected and provided data to EPA, some targeted new housingor other high risk taps while others took random samples. In addition,certain geographic areas are severely under-represented. These data portraylead levels in cities with several water types, including both waters consideredvery corrosive towards lead and those considered to be relatively noncorrosive.Thus, these data are most useful for assessing the lead levels likely tooccur under specific water quality conditions and with different plumbingmaterials. These systems have frequently measured levels of lead in morningfirst draw samples as high as 1-2 mg/l. A detailed presentation and analysisof these data appears in the Treatment and Occurrence Support Document(EPA, 1988h).As described earlier, in the Patterson (1981) study, random daytime grabsamples flushed for 30 seconds were collected and analyzed for lead. Flushingfor 30 seconds will tend to result in samples with lower lead levels comparedwith levels that might be found in morning first draw samples and randomdaytime grab samples, because of the lower average standing time, tendto be lower also. The Patterson data are useful because of the large numberof samples taken (782 samples), and because the geographic distributionof the samples was representative of the country (58 cities in 47 Stateswere sampled). The percentage of samples collected from each State generallyreflects the State population, except for California, which was slightlyunder-represented, and Illinois, which was somewhat over-represented. Inthe study, 60 percent of all samples were less than or equal to 0.010 mg/l,84 percent were less than 0.020 mg/l, 97 percent were less than 0.050 mg/l,and 3 percent werer greater than or equal to 0.050 mg/l. (Information onlead levels below 0.010 mg/l are not available from this study, as thereported analytic detection limit was 0.010 mg/l.)Because lead in tap water occurs primarily as a by-product of corrosion,the extent of moderately or highly corrosive water can give an indicationof the potential extent of lead in tap water. The extent of corrosive waterin the U.S. has been evaluated in several studies. The U.S. GeologicalSurvey (USGS) (Durfor and Becker, 1964, as reported by EPA, 1986a) foundthat 17 States had very soft (corrosive) water (less than 60 mg/l as CaCO<T2>3</T2>). The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES I) was conducted by the National Center of Health Statistics (Greathouseand Osborne, 1980, as reported by EPA, 1986a). It showed similar results:about one-third of the country had very soft water (under 60 mg/l as CaCO<T2>3</T2>). The American Water Works Association (AWWA) has estimatedthat about 66 percent of public water systems deliver water with pHandgreater;8and/or carbonate alkalinity andgreater;30 mg/l (EPA, 1988a). Also, data reportedby public water supplies to the States pursuant to 40 CFR andSection; 141.42(d)indicate that as many as 80 percent of public water systems may delivermoderately or highly corrosive water, as indicated by pH andgreater;8 and/oralkalinity andgreater;30 mg/l (EPA, 1988i).As explained above, lead levels in tap water can be particularly high whenlead solder is less than five years old, due to galvanic action betweenlead solder and copper pipes (Oliphant, 1982 and 1983). A recent studyby EPA (1986a) estimated the extent of housing likely to contain lead solderparticularly susceptible to galvanic corrosion by estimating the numberof new houses in the U.S. Based on the number of new housing starts in1983 and 1984, EPA estimated in 1986 that there were about 3.5 millionnew housing units less than 2 years old. About 8.1 million people wereestimated to live in new homes served by public water supplies. Using thesame method, the Agency now estimates that about 4.3 million homes arethree to five years old and they house about 11 million poeple served bypublic water supplies. b. <T3>Copper. </T3>Patterson (EPA, 1981) also measured copper levels in the30-second partially flushed samples taken at random times during the day.In that study, 3 percent of the samples had copper levels exceeding 1 mg/land 19 percent exceeded 0.2 mg/l. The national average was 0.221 mg/l (median=0.04mg/l). The south central U.S. had the lowest average levels (average=0.82;median=0.02 mg/l), and the northeast had the highest average levels (average=0.526mg/l; median=0.06 mg/l).B. Regulatory Approach In developing a regulatory approach for controlling lead and copper indrinking water, EPA was confronted with several problems. As describedin the previous section, lead and copper differ in a very basic way fromother drinking water contaminants because they generally do not occur insignificant amounts in source water; rather, they generally enter the waterin the distribution system from the corrosive action of the water in contactwith plumbing materials containing lead and copper. Thus, the traditionalregulatory approach, which is based on removing drinking water contaminantsat the treatment plant prior to distribution, will have little or no effecton lead and copper levels at the consumer's tap (except for systems withlead and/or copper in their source water). Second, much of the lead- andcopper-bearing plumbing material is privately owned (i.e., inside of buildings)and outside the public water system's control, which, in turn, restrictsthe regulatory options available, since national primary drinking waterregulations only apply to public water systems.Third, the occurrence of lead and copper contamination emanating from corrosionof plumbing systems within individual residences and other buildings introducesa wide source of potential variability among lead and copper levels thatwill be present in water samples taken at the tap. This problem makes itdifficult for EPA to set uniform numbers, i.e., MCLs. for these contaminantsthat can be met at taps throughout a public water system. Today's notice proposes a two-part approach to address the two sourcesof lead and copper in drinking water (corrosion of plumbing in the distributionsystem and source water contamination): A treatment technique requiringcorrosion control to reduce leaching of lead and copper and public educationto reduce exposure, and MCLs applicable to water entering the distributionsystem. This section explains EPA's rationale for this approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Treatment Technique Considerations </ITAG>As explained earlier, the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in 1986,requires EPA to promulgate NPDWRs for 83 contaminants including lead andcopper. Section 1412(b)(1). The Act does not distinguish between the twovery different ways in which contaminants can enter drinking water: Asby-products of corrosion versus occurrence in source water. The Act statesthat an NPDWR must contain an MCL or a treatment technique, and that EPAis authorized to promulgate a treatment technique in lieu of an MCL ifit finds that it is not ``economically or technologically feasible to ascertainthe level of the contaminant.'' Sections 1401(1)(C) and 1412(b)(7)(A).In developing the proposed regulation, EPA considered whether it was feasibleto adequately monitor drinking water for the parameters of concern. Althoughit is feasible to measure accurately the amount of lead in a given watersample down to the practical quantitation limit (PQL), 0.005 mg/l (as describedbelow), and copper down to the MCLG, these measurements alone bear littlerelation to the major issue of concern_the rate and extent of corrosionof lead and copper from plumbing materials. As explained earlier, there can be considerable variability in lead andcopper levels at the tap; even under constant water conditions (e.g., pH,alkalinity, temperature, and other parameters), there will be variabilitydepending on the age and configuration of the building's plumbing. In addition,because water suppliers begin with different source waters, after corrosioncontrol treatment to achieve particular levels of specified water qualityparameters (e.g., pH = 8) lead and copper levels can still vary (assumingthere is at least some of each of these metals in the plumbing system).Generally, application of an effective treatment technology to remove contaminantswill result in predictable contaminant levels in the finished water. Thus,measuring these levels will indicate whether treatment was effectivelyapplied. For instance, application of reverse osmosis treatment to influentwater with lead and copper levels in a specified range will reliably reducethe amount of lead and copper to certain levels; thus, measuring the effluentlead and copper levels will indicate whether the treatment was effective.In contrast, a single measurement of the lead or copper level at an individualtap is not a meaningful measure of the efficacy of any corrosion controltreatment that is being applied because lead and copper levels at the tapcan vary for reasons other than treatment effectivness. Since the resultinglead and copper levels will vary from system to system (and even from tapto tap within a system) after corrosion control treatment is applied, itis technologically infeasible to ascertain whether the lead or copper levelat a tap at a single point in time represents effective application ofthe best available treatment technology, assuming BAT is optimal corrosioncontrol treatment. The only way to tell whether a given system has optimizedcorrosion control treatment is to determine which specific water conditions,such as pH level, result in the lowest lead or copper levels for that system.In conclusion, because of the variability of the occurrence of lead andcopper within and among water systems, the Agency is unable to select asingle level of lead or copper in drinking water that indicates whethera system has implemented optimal corrosion control treatment. Unfortunately,there is no known reliable index or measure of water corrosivity towardslead and copper plumbing materials either. Therefore, EPA is proposingtreatment technique requirements to control lead and copper as corrosionby-products. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Problems with Setting an MCL at the Tap</ITAG>EPA considered whether it could set MCLs at the tap for lead and copperthat were based on optimal corrosion control treatment, as well as removalof lead and copper from source water at the treatment plant. Under section1412(b)(4) of the Act, the MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible.``Feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the best technology, treatmenttechniques and other means which the administrator finds * * * are available(taking cost into consideration)'' (BAT). Section 1412(b)(5). Thus, insetting MCLs for lead and copper based on optimal corrosion control treatment,EPA would have to determine what levels of these contaminants are ``feasible''to achieve using this technology. In considering what levels are feasibleto achieve, EPA must consider the range of conditions a public water systemfaces. Some customers may have plumbing containing only small amounts oflead and copper (so leaching is less likely), while others may have plumbingthat contains large amounts of lead, possibly as new lead solder (so leachingis more likely). In determining what is feasible, EPA also must consider the extent of thepublic water system's responsibility under the Safe Drinking Water Actfor contaminant levels at the tap, especially for contaminants enteringthe water from the distribution system after any treatment, i.e., corrosionby-products. Under section 1411, NPDWRs apply to ``public water systems.''Section 1401(4) defines ``public water system'' as:<ITAG tagnum="21">A system for the provision to the public of piped water for humanconsumption * * *. Such term includes (A) any collection, treatment, storage,and distribution facilities under control of the operator of such system* * * and (B) any collection or pretreatment storage facilities not undersuch control * * *. </ITAG>It is important to note that this definition clearly distinguishes betweenfacilities under the system's control and facilities that are not. Furthermore,the term ``public water system'' specifically includes ``distribution facilitiesunder control of the operator of such system''; yet ``distribution facilities''are not listed among the facilities <T3>not </T3>under the system's control that are nonetheless included inthe definition of public water system. Thus, it appears that while Congressincluded distribution systems within the public water system's control,it deliberately excluded distribution facilities not under the system'scontrol, e.g., customers' plumbing, from the definition of ``public watersystem.'' EPA believes this provision precludes the Agency from promulgatingan NPDWR that holds a public water system liable for conditions in theparts of the distribution system that are outside its control. This isa reasonable interpretation since the public water system does not generallyhave control over these facilities and thus should not be held responsiblefor them. Because the public water system is not responsible for distribution facilitiesoutside its control, the question arises as to what MCLs based on corrosioncontrol are feasible for lead and copper given that the standard must takeinto account the range of conditions occurring in these facilities, i.e.,in customers' plumbing. In other words, in setting MCLs for lead and copperbased on optimal corrosion control treatment (and any necessary technologyto remove lead and/or copper in the source water), EPA would have to selectlevels that are feasible for large public water systems to meet, regardlessof the type and age of the plumbing in its customers' homes; any more stringentMCL would hold the system liable for a violation caused by distributionfacilities outside its control, which would be inconsistent with the Act'sdefinition of public water system. In reviewing the data available, it appears that any MCL for lead at thetap that would be feasible, i.e., achievable by systems that have installedthe best available technology (assuming BAT consists of some technologythat removes any lead in the source water and optimal corrosion controltreatment), regardless of the condition of its customers' plumbing, wouldbe relatively high, perhaps a maximum of 0.030-0.040 mg/l in single samplesof morning first draw water, or an average of 0.015-0.020 mg/l in morningfirst draw samples. EPA believes these levels represent unnecessarily highexposures for large segments of the population. It has been suggested that, rather than selecting an MCL that systems couldmeet regardless of homeowner plumbing, EPA should set a more stringentMCL and make variances available for systems that cannot meet it becauseof homeowner plumbing. Under section 1415 of the Act, variances are availableto systems which cannot meet an MCL ``because of characteristics of theraw water sources which are reasonably available to the systems.'' EPAbelieves Congress intended that variances should be available when levelsof the regulated contaminant were so high in the source water that BATcould not remove sufficient quantities to meet the MCL, or when some othercharacteristic of the source water prevented the best available technologyfrom achieving the MCL. In the case of corrosion by-products such as leadand copper, any exceedence of an MCL at the tap after application of BAT(assuming it consists of technology to remove these contaminants in thesource water and installation of optimal corrosion control treatment) wouldnot be the result of extraordinary levels of the contaminant in the sourcewater. Rather, the exceedence would be due to the addition of lead and/orcopper from leaching of materials in the distribution system includingplumbing in individual houses. This rules out the first basis for the variance,i.e., levels too high for effective removal by BAT. Arguably, however,a system could get a variance on the second basis, i.e., because the natureof its raw water source is such that, even after installation of BAT (assumingBAT consists of a technology to remove any lead and/or copper in the sourcewater and optimal corrosion control treatment), the system could not meetthe MCL. At least three problems arise with this approach, however.The first problem is that variances are temporary in nature; section 1415assumes eventual compliance with the standard when a variance is granted.This section specifically requires that every variance be accompanied bya schedule for coming into compliance; this schedule must require compliance``as expeditiously as practicable.'' However, it is likely that, in caseswhere the MCL violation is a result of corrosion of private plumbing, therewill not be sufficient measures that a public water system can take unilaterallyto achieve compliance. Thus, no reasonable compliance plan (much less aschedule for implementing it) could be devised. The second problem is thatmany, if not all, systems would require variances because at least a few,if not many, buildings served by them are likely to have lead and/or copperplumbing that are not under the water supplier's control. The Agency doesnot believe it makes sense to promulgate an MCL that many systems not onlycannot meet now, but also could not meet at some future time. Furthermore,the Act requires that an MCL must be feasible. In determining what is feasible,the legislative history of both the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 andthe 1986 amendments indicates that EPA is to consider whether the technologyis reasonably affordable by regional and large metropolitan public watersystems (see H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185, p. 18 (1974) and statement of SenatorDurenberger, 132, <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>S6287 (daily ed., May 12, 1986)). Large systems arenot less likely than smaller systems to serve homes with lead and/or copperplumbing; in fact, they are probably more likely to serve at least somesuch homes since they serve so many customers. EPA believes that an MCLthat most large systems (as well as many small systems) cannot meet whenthey install BAT is not feasible under the Act. The third problem is thata system qualifies for a variance under section 1415 only if operationunder the variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. Assumingthere is some lead level(s) and some copper level(s) which represent anunreasonable risk to health, then any system exceeding these levels wouldnot qualify for a variance. Thus, the systems that ``need'' the variancethe most (i.e., those least capable of meeting the MCL because they arethe furthest from compliance) would not qualify for it.Despite these considerations, some interested parties nonetheless haveindicated that they believe MCLs at the tap are appropriate for regulatinglead and copper. EPA solicits comments on the details of such a regulation,including suggestions on overcoming the difficulties associated with anMCL approach that are described above. Specifically, commenters shouldspecify the appropriate MCL and the basis for selecting this value, whatmonitoring requirements should apply (e.g., whether the NPDWR should allowsystems to avoid monitoring at residences with high lead and/or coppercontent in their household plumbing), and whether systems that have installedBAT and still cannot meet the MCL because of private plumbing should beconsidered permanently out of compliance (and thus subject indefinitelyto public notification requirements and citizen suit enforcement actionsto compel compliance).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. MCLs Applicable to Water Entering the Distribution System</ITAG>While EPA recognizes that most of the lead and copper found in drinkingwater from the tap is added by plumbing after the water leaves the treatmentplant, as described above, in an estimated one percent of the systems,lead and/or copper may occur at high levels in the source water. Therefore,EPA evaluted the feasibility of establishing MCLs for lead and copper indistributed water, i.e., MCLs that would apply, and for which compliancecould be monitored as the water enters the distribution system, after anytreatment. Such MCLs would not be subject to the problems associated withestablishing MCLs to control contributions of lead and copper due to corrosionand monitoring for compliance with such MCLs. These MCLs would reduce totallead and copper levels by removing these contaminants when they occur insource water.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Summary of Proposed Regulatory Approach</ITAG>In conclusion, most of the lead and copper found in drinking water at thetap is added by plumbing after the water leaves the treatment plant. Ina few systems, lead and/or copper may occur at high levels in the sourcewater. Therefore, the most important step a public water system can taketo control lead and copper levels at the tap is to install optimal corrosioncontrol treatment. However, it is technically infeasible to set MCLs atthe tap for these contaminants because no single lead or copper measurement,or any other water parameter, indicates whether treatment was effectivelyapplied, i.e., corrosion control treatment has been optimized. Consequently,in this rule, EPA is proposing an NPDWR consisting of a treatment techniquerequirement that would require optimal corrosion control treatment. Inaddition, this MPDWR would require public education when lead levels exceedcertain values even after optimal corrosion control treatment.In addition, the Agency is proposing MCLs for lead and copper that wouldapply to water leaving the drinking water treatment plant (if the wateris treated) and entering the distribution system. By limiting lead andcopper in distributed water, this proposal would result in contaminantlevels closer to the MCLGs than would be possible with the treatment techniquerule alone. Together, these three NPDWRs (one for lead and copper as corrosionby-products, one for lead in source water, and one for copper in sourcewater) would address the contamination of drinking water by lead and copper.Today's proposal would fulfill the goal of the SDWA by requiring an importantreduction in the levels of lead and copper present in consumers' water.EPA believes the resulting lead and copper levels would be as close tothe MCLG as is feasible. In addition, EPA believes that these proposedNPDWRs (establishing ``no-action levels'' of an average lead level of 0.010mg/l lead, 1.3 mg/l or less copper in 95 percent or more samples, and pHandgreater;8 in 95 percent or more samples to trigger treatment, and a no-actionlevel of an average of 0.010 mg/l lead and 0.020 mg/l or less lead in 95percent or more samples to trigger public education) would be protectiveof public health. The Agency expects that implementation of this proposalwould result in large reductions in the number of people who experienceblood lead levels above the range of concern of 10-15 ug/dl, and above25 ug/dl, the level above which CDC recommends medical intervention. SectionX.A of this notice presents estimates of the benefits associated with theproposal.<T3>C. Treatment for Lead and Copper in Source Water</T3>EPA evaluated technologies for treatment of lead and copper in source waterto determine which are BAT. Table 1 summarizes the technologies identifiedby EPA for the removal of these drinking water contaminants. Table 2 liststhe removal efficiencies that are attainable through the use of the identifiedtechnologies. Examination of these technologies indicates that they arecapable of reducing contaminant levels from the maximum levels of occurrencein source water to the proposed MCLG for copper and down to 0.005 mg/lfor lead. Table 3 shows the removal efficiencies that would be requiredof treatment technologies to reduce the maximum expected influent concentrationsdown to 1.3 mg/l for copper and 0.005 mg/l for lead (listed as ``MCL-EffluentConcentration'' in the table. The influent concentrations assumed correspondto maximum observed occurrence levels in drinking water sources.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Candidate Best Available Technologies (BATs) for the Removal of leadand Copper From Drinking Water Supplies</T4><H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>Technologies</H1><H2>Coagulation/Filtration</H2><H2>Ion exchange</H2><H2>Lime softening</H2><H2>Reverse osmosis</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s25,7,xs36,7,7</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Removal Efficiencies of Candidate BATs</T4>1,2<ITAG tagnum="96">[in percent]</ITAG><H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>Technologies (percent removal)</H1><H2>Coagulation/Filtration</H2><H2>Ion exchange</H2><H2>Lime softening</H2><H2>Reverse osmosis</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>80-99</D><D>up to 95</D><D>97-99</D><D>90-99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>60-95</D><D>up to 95</D><D>90-96</D><D>90-99</D><F>\1\ </F><T3>Source: </T3>``Technologies and Costs for the Removal of lead fromPotable Water Supplies.''

However, based on available information, the costs in Tables4-7 are representative of typical system costs using these technologies.Two different models have been used to calculate the costs in Tables 4-7.A small system cost model has been used for systems that serve less than3,300 people. This model assumes that a package treatment plant would beinstalled to treat the water. The model used for systems serving more than3,300 people assumes that the treatment plant would be built in the field.Costs of treatment will be less than shown in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7 ifcontaminant concentration levels encountered in the raw water are lowerthan the maximum occurrence levels used for the supporting calculations.EPA expects this to be the case in most instances. For example, if thecontaminant level in the raw water is half of the maximum occurrence level,then treatment costs could be expected to be approximately 20 to 50 percentlower than the costs presented. However, costs of treatment could be higherif, for instance, there are additional site-specific treatment or storagerequirements. The various removal technologies considered are describedin more detail below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Ion Exchange</ITAG>This notice proposes to designate sodium cation exchange to remove leadand copper as BAT because of its demonstrated ability to reduce levelsof lead and copper to 0.005 mg/l for lead and to the proposed MCLG forcopper, at reasonable costs. Sodium cation exchange resins and ion exchangeequipment are readily available commercially. Sodium cation exchange hasbeen successfully used in the field, and pilot plant studies demonstratethat this technology can be used to remove up to 95 percent of lead andup to 95 percent of copper from water. Ion exchange treatment can be implementedeffectively for all sizes of treatment facilities. The cost of employingion exchange for removal of lead and copper in drinking water has beenestimated for source water lead concentrations of 0.100 mg/l and sourcewater copper concentrations of 10 mg/l and are included in Tables 4, 5,6, and 7. Blending can significantly reduce ion exchange equipment requirementsand operating costs, since then only a portion of the raw water has tobe treated. Ion exchange is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity,iron, and organic contaminants. Pretreatment may therefore be necessaryin some cases. Also, ion exchange can soften water, making it more corrosive,especially if calcium breakthrough is used as the indicator for resin regeneration.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reverse Osmosis</ITAG>EPA also is proposing to designate reverse osmosis (RO) technology as BATbecause it has been demonstrated to be effective in removing lead and copperat reasonable costs. RO has been widely used on a full scale basis forthe reduction of other contaminants, and pilot plant studies demonstratethat this technology is capable of removing 95 percent of lead (when sourcewater lead is 0.100 mg/l) and 95 percent of copper (when source water copperis 10 mg/l) from drinking water. The costs of employing RO to reduce thesecontaminants from these levels in drinking water are presented in Tables4, 5, 6, and 7. A major disadvantage of RO is that in removing dissolvedsolids from water, and thereby softening it, RO makes the water more corrosivetoward lead and copper in plumbing. Thus, source water treated by thisprocess would require subsequent corrosion control treatment to raise pHand stabilize the water before distribution.RO performance is adversely affected by the presence of turbidity, iron,manganese, silica, or scale-producing constituents in source water. Ifpretreatment is not already in place to remove these constituents, thecost to install the pretreatment technologies (e.g., pH adjustment, filtration,application of scale prevention additives) may be considerable.In the case of contamination of source water by several contaminants, inaddition to lead and/or copper, the RO process may offer an especiallydesirable and cost effective approach to their removal. Blending can reducecosts, as only a portion of the water may need to be treated.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Lime Softening</ITAG>Lime softening can achieve 97 to 99 percent removal of lead at pH levelsof 9.0 to 10.5 and 90 to 96 percent removal of copper at pH levels of 9.0to 11.5, as indicated by laboratory and pilot plant studies. This technologyis considered BAT because it has been demonstrated to reduce lead and copperin water to 0.005 mg/l for lead and the proposed MCLG for copper at reasonablecosts. Lime softening has been widely and effectively used on a full scalebasis for the reduction of hardness. The costs of installing new lime softeningfacilities to reduce contaminant concentrations in drinking water from0.10 mg/l to 0.005 mg/l for lead and 10 mg/l the MCLG for copper are shownin Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7. One advantage of lime softening is that it increasesthe pH of the water and thus reduces its corrosivity.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Coagulation/Filtration</ITAG>EPA is proposing coagulation/filtration technology as BAT for lead andcopper removal because of its demonstrated ability to reduce levels oflead and copper to the proposed MCLG for copper and 0.005 mg/l for leadat reasonable costs.Laboratory and pilot plant studies indicate that conventional coagulation/filtrationusing alum, and in some cases, ferric sulfate coagulant, can achieve 80to 95 percent removal of lead at pH levels of 8.0 or above, and can achieve60 to 95 percent removal of copper at these same pHs. Removal efficienciesare estimated based on source water lead levels of 0.10 mg/l and copperof 10 mg/l. Published studies (EPA, 1978) suggest that site-specific rawwater quality indicators, such as pH, significantly affect the removalefficiency of alum when used to treat ground water. However, data are notavailable which specifically identify all optimum operating conditionsof coagulation/filtration treatment for lead and copper removal.Coagulation/filtration is very effective when ferric sulfate is used asthe coagulant. In pilot-scale studies, greater than 95 percent removalshave been achieved using this coagulant. When alum is used as the coagulantin doses above 20 mg/l, removal efficiencies of 95 percent have been achievedin surface water. For ground water, either much larger alum doses or pHadjustment is required to achieve 95 percent removal of lead. Coagulation/filtrationhas been used on a full scale basis for the reduction of other contaminantsin water, including turbidity, particulate matter, and microbial contaminants(EPA, 1978). Estimated costs to reduce lead and copper using conventionalcoagulation/filtration are shown in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Selection of BAT</ITAG>In conclusion, the Agency believes that, of the technologies that can removelead and copper from source water, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, limesoftening, and coagulation/filtration fulfill the requirements of the SDWAas BAT for lead and copper in source water. These treatment technologieshave high efficiencies for lead and copper removal from source water, andthe cost of these technologies for large public water systems is reasonable.Under the Act, other treatment technologies could be used to remove leador copper. However, a system would be required to install one of the BATsin order to be eligible for a variance from the MCL.All of the technologies proposed as BAT are currently available, have beeninstalled in public water systems, and are compatible with other watertreatment processes in different regions of the U.S. Furthermore, thesetechnologies are available and effective for the reduction of these contaminantsfrom the maximum levels of occurrence in source water to 0.005 mg/l forlead and to the proposed MCLG level for copper (1.3 mg/l).D. Treatment for Lead and Copper as Corrosion By-products<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Corrosion Control</ITAG>All water is corrosive to metallic plumbing materials to some degree; therelative corrosivity of a given water supply depends on a variety of factors.There is no single corrosivity index that can predict water corrosivityto lead and copper, and the water of each water supplier may be minimallycorrosive to these metals under slightly different finished water qualityconditions.The degree of water corrosivity toward lead and copper plumbing materialsdepends largely on the pH and alkalinity of the water, although a numberof additional factors, such as temperature, flow rate, free chlorine levels,age of plumbing materials, and other factors are important as well. Whilethe use of specific plumbing materials in buildings is not under the controlof water suppliers, water chemistry parameters are. Therefore, adjustmentof water quality parameters, especially pH and alkalinity, to minimallycorrosive ranges and addition of corrosion inhibitors are the primary methodsof corrosion control treatment available to public water systems to minimizelead and copper levels.The corrosivity of acidic water toward lead plumbing materials is welldocumented (EPA, 1982; Hoyt et al., 1979; O'Brien et al., 1976; Lyon andLenihan, 1977; Gregory and Jackson, 1984). Water with pH below 8.0, andespecially below 7.0, tends to be more corrosive toward lead and copperthan water with pH greater than 8.0, and more corrosive water tends toproduce water samples with higher lead and copper levels.The alkalinity of water, which is related to pH, is also an important factorin determining its corrosivity and, in turn, its likelihood of producinghigh lead and copper levels at the tap. Water contains alkalinity in severalforms, including carbonate ion, bicarbonate ion, and hydroxyl ion, in equilibrium.The pH of the water largely determines which of these species predominatesin the equilibrium. At pHs less than 8.3, equilibrium favors the bicarbonateform. At pHs between 8.3 and 10, equilibrium tends toward the carbonateform, and pHs above 10 favor hydroxyl. Under certain chemical conditions (especially high pH), the carbonate inwater will react with lead in the plumbing to form a film of basic leadcarbonate or other relatively insoluble salt on the interior surface ofthe pipes and solder. This film isolates the lead metal from the waterand thus slows the rate at which lead from the pipes or solder is dissolvedinto the water. Carbonate also limits the amount of lead the water willhold in solution. Depending on the raw water quality, treating the water to minimize itscorrosivity may require the adjustment of pH and alkalinity, individuallyor simultaneously. Experience in field and laboratory studies indicatesthat stabilization of the water can reduce corrosion and reduce levelsof lead substantially (EPA, 1982; Karalekas et al., 1983; Karalekas etal., 1978; EPA, 1988h). In addition, the presence of carbonate is an importantfactor in stabilizing the pH of the water because it adds buffering capacity.Without the buffering capacity imparted by the carbonate water pH can decreaseas it moves through the distribution system. There are also other methods for a water supplier to reduce the corrosivityof its water. These include the use of corrosion inhibitors, such as orthophosphates,and the adjustment of free chlorine levels (EPA, 1987c). Sodium hexametaphosphatehas also been used as a corrosion inhibitor, as have other chemicals, althoughthey may not be as effective as orthophosphates. The rate of copper corrosion is also dependent on pH. However, alkalinityappears to be a less important factor than in copper corrosion than leadcorrosion. Corrosion of copper pipe is rapidly accelerated at pHs below5.0; morning first draw samples at pHs less than 5.5 will likely exceed1.0 mg/l. The copper concentrations will increase with decreasing pH, increasingtemperature, and decreasing age of copper pipe. As pH is increased to 8.0and above, the rate of copper corrosion is reduced. The chemical behaviorof copper and lead are similar so that most treatments (such as pH andalkalinity adjustment) to lower the solubility of lead will have a similareffect on copper. For instance, the pH level for effective lead corrosioncontrol is 8.0 or greater, and this is also an appropriate pH for controlof copper corrosion. Therefore, EPA has determined that properly appliedcorrosion control for lead will also adequately control copper concentrations(AWWARF, 1985). a. <T3>Methods of pH Adjustment.</T3> Adjustment of pH is one of the mostcommon methods of reducing corrosion in water distribution systems. Inmany instances, if sufficient alkalinity is present, pH adjustment is adequateto control the corrosivity of water. The least expensive and most commonly used chemical for pH adjustment issodium hydroxide (NaOH, or caustic soda); potassium hydroxide may alsobe used in water with high sodium levels. Lime (especially in the formof calcium carbonate slurry) addition is also used commonly for pH adjustment.Experience in field, pilot plant, and laboratory tests indicates that asubstantial reduction of lead and copper in drinking water may be achievedby pH adjustment. Estimated costs for pH adjustment using sodium hydroxideto control corrosion of lead and copper range from $0.67/1,000 gallonsfor systems serving less than 100 persons to $0.03/1,000 gallons for systemsserving more than 1,000,000 persons. Estimated costs for pH adjustmentusing lime to control corrosion of lead and copper range from $0.85/1,000gallons for systems serving fewer than 100 persons to $0.006/1,000 gallonsfor systems serving more than 1,000,000 persons (EPA, 1988h). The Metropolitan Regional Water Authority (MRWA), which supplies waterto Boston, Massachusetts, and surrounding communities, has implementedcorrosion control by pH adjustment. (The MRWA used to be called the MetropolitanDistrict Commission, or MDC.) The raw water is low in hardness, alkalinity,total dissolved solids, and pH. Prior to the start of corrosion control,treatment consisted of chlorination and ammoniation only. The treatment program implemented by MRWA consists of adding 14 mg/l ofcaustic (50 percent NaOH) to treat 300 million gallons/day (MGD). The pHof the finished water is increased to 8.5 at the reservoir after treatmentbut before distribution. The alkalinity of the finished water is only slightlyincreased as a result of this treatment. Samples were collected in from twelve to fourteen homes served by MRWAover a period of five years. The homes selected for the sampling programhave lead service lines. Three samples were taken at each location representingfirst draw water (i.e., water in the interior plumbing), water from theservice line, and water in the main (i.e., fully flushed water). The goalof the program was to reduce most samples to less than 0.050 mg/l. Sincethe sampling program began before the implementation of the corrosion controltreatment, the effectiveness of this treatment toward its goal can be evaluated.The results of this analysis have been published (Karalekas et al., 1983).In this article, the data from the fourteen locations were evaluated differentlyfrom the approach EPA is proposing in this rule for determining compliance.However, the effectiveness of the treatment in reducing lead levels canstill be evaluated from the data. In this article, the results of all threesamples from all locations sampled were averaged. The average lead concentrationranged from 0.060 mg/l to 0.128 mg/l between February 1976 and May 1977,before the use of NaOH to adjust pH began. The average lead concentrationdropped substantially after the start of this treatment; except duringtwo interruptions in the pH adjustment treatment, the average lead concentrationwas reduced consistently to below 0.050 mg/l (ranging from 0.010 mg/l to0.050 mg/l), MRWA's target lead concentration. In addition, the City of Seattle, Washington, has adjusted the pH of itsCedar River supply in an effort to control corrosion (EPA, 1988h). Thetreatment program implemented by Seattle in 1983 consists of adding 2 mg/lof lime as CaO to adjust the pH from 7.5 to 8.2. The total alkalinity inthe raw water varies seasonally from 16.3 mg/l to 23 mg/l as CaCO<T2>3</T2>. Sampling to determine the extent of the problem began in 1979 and is stillongoing. Two samples are taken at each location. The first sample is astanding sample (not morning first draw) and the second sample is a flushedsample. The mean lead concentration for the Cedar River supply standingsamples dropped from 0.0103 mg/l to 0.0038 mg/l after treatment. The percentageof standing samples with lead concentrations less than 0.010 mg/l rosefrom only 50 percent before treatment of 93.8 percent after treatment.These data demonstrate that adjustment of pH can effectively reduce thecorrosivity of water towards lead in interior plumbing and can greatlyreduce the levels of lead in tap water. b. <T3>Methods of Alkalinity Adjustment.</T3> For waters that are low in carbonateor bicarbonate alkalinity, pH adjustment alone is often insufficient tocontrol corrosion because there are insufficient carbonate ions in thewater to form a protective layer on the interior surface of the pipes orlead solder. In those low alkalinity waters, carbonate ion must be addedto form the insoluble carbonates. Soda ash (Na<T2>2</T2>CO<T2>3</T2>) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<T2>3</T2>) is typically added for this purpose. Lime (calcium oxide slurry) or sodium hydroxide, in conjunction with sodaash (sodium carbonate) and sodium bicarbonate, may be used together toadjust pH and carbonate alkalinity simultaneously. These methods are cost-effectiveand are practiced by many water suppliers already. Estimated costs fortreating the water using these chemicals range from $1.49/1,000 gallonsfor systems serving 25 to 100 persons to $0.08/1,000 gallons for systemsserving more than 1,000,000 persons (EPA, 1988h). A program to control corrosion combining pH and alkalinity adjustment wasimplemented by the City of Bennington, Vermont, on its water supply inAugust 1977. The treatment program consists of adding 3 mg/l of sodiumhydroxide to adjust the pH from 5.0 to 7.2 and 10 mg/l of sodium bicarbonateto adjust the alkalinity from less than 1 mg/l to 15 mg/l as CaCO<T2>3</T2>. The goal of the program was to reduce average lead levels toless than 0.050 mg/l. Samples were collected periodically from nine toeleven homes from April 1977 to November 1980. Three samples were takenat each location, representing first draw water (i.e., water in the interiorplumbing), water in the service line, and water in the main (i.e., fullyflushed water). The mean lead concentration for the first flush sampleswas reduced from 0.101 mg/l to 0.0342 mg/l as a result of the treatment.The mean lead concentration in the service line samples was reduced from0.184 mg/l to 0.0302 mg/l and the mean lead concentration in the fullyflushed samples was reduced from 0.102 mg/l to 0.0167 mg/l as a resultof this treatment. In addition, the number of samples with lead concentrationsless than 0.010 mg/l increased as a result of the corrosion control treatment.While only 2.6 percent of the first flush samples contained less than 0.010mg/l lead before treatment, after treatment was implemented, 20.9 percentof the first flush samples contained less than 0.010 mg/l lead (EPA, 1988h).In 1983, the City of Seattle, Washington began adjusting pH and alkalinityof its Tolt River supply. The treatment program consists of adding 2 mg/lof lime as CaO to adjust the pH from 6.2 to 8.2 and 9 mg/l of sodium carbonateas Na<T2>2</T2>CO<T2>3</T2> to adjust the total alkalinity from 4 to 12 mg/l as CaCO<T2>3</T2>. The study of the Tolt River supply was conducted at the same time as thestudy on Seattle's Cedar River supply, and the sampling procedure was thesame as described in the discussion of the Cedar water supply above. Themean lead concentration for the standing samples from the Tolt River supplydropped from 0.0102 mg/l before treatment to 0.0041 mg/l after treatment.The percentage of standing samples with lead concentrations less than 0.010mg/l increased as a result of treatment from 50 to 90.3 percent (EPA, 1988h).These data show that increasing pH and alkalinity within appropriate concentrationlimits can effectively reduce the corrosivity of water towards lead ininterior plumbing and greatly reduce the levels of lead in tap water. c. <T3>Corrosion Inhibitors. </T3>Corrosion inhibitors control corrosion byaccelerating or enhancing the formation of a protective film to serve asa barrier between the water and the pipe or solder surfaces. The most commonlyused corrosion inhibitors include orthophosphates and silicates (althoughsilicates may be more effective for reducing corrosion of iron or galvanizedpipe than lead and copper pipe and solder). Recent data indicate that zincorthophosphate may be the most effective corrosion inhibitor for lead pipeand solder (AWWARF, 1985).Corrosion inhibitors have been used for years to reduce water corrosionby all sizes of water systems. Estimated costs for controlling corrosionwith inhibitors range from $0.91/1,000 gallons for systems serving lessthan 100 persons to $0.007/1.000 gallons for systems serving more than1,000,000 persons (EPA, 1988h).d. <T3>Consideration of Disinfection Needs in Designing Corrosion ControlTreatment. </T3>Use of corrosion inhibitors or adjusting the pH and alkalinityof water to reduce its corrosiveness toward lead and copper can have unintendedeffects on the quality of finished water. Water treatment should be carefullydesigned to account for the following circumstances.Adjustment of pH can affect the effectiveness of disinfectants. For instance,if systems use chlorination for disinfection, elevation of pH should bedelayed, to the extent possible, until just prior to when the water entersthe distribution system. This will maximize the contact time during whichdisinfection with chlorine is most efficient (since chlorination is mosteffective at low pHs) while also optimizing corrosion control in the distributionsystem.Since elevated pHs may increase trihalomethane (THM) formation in the distributionsystem, systems using surface water sources should assure maximum THM precursorremoval by optimizing the clarification process prior to increasing thepH. Systems using groundwater sources with high concentrations of THM precursorsmay need to install treatment to remove such precursors (e.g., membranefiltration) or use alternative disinfectants to free chlorine (e.g., chlorinedioxide or ozone followed by chloramines) in order to achieve adequatedisinfection, minimize THM formation, and control corrosion at the sametime. In certain cases, THM formation and the need to remove THM precursorsmay be reduced if orthophosphates or another corrosion inhibitor is used,as these chemicals work best at pHs somewhat below 8.e. <T3>Materials Benefits of Corrosion Control Treatment. </T3>EPA recentlypublished an analysis of the benefits of reducing lead levels in drinkingwater (EPA, 1986a). This analysis included an estimate of the materialsbenefits (in terms of reduced pipe corrosion and failure, increased servicelife for water meters, etc.) that are likely to result from requiring watersuppliers to install corrosion control treatment. The report estimatedthat the materials benefits alone of corrosion control would exceed bymore than two times the costs of implementing the treatment.Further, a National Bureau of Standards report estimated that 20 percentof the costs of reported damage from water supply corrosion costs wereavoidable by the use of control measures (Bennett et al., 1979). The nationalannual costs of damage from corrosion in the water supply field were estimatedat $700 million in 1975 (or $1,300 million in 1986 dollars). However, thesecosts are only for distribution systems; often far greater corrosion costsare incurred through damage to interior piping and plumbing systems withinbuildings (Ryder, 1980). Corrosion control by suppliers would reduce thesedamages as well.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Lead Service Connection Replacement </ITAG>EPA evaluated requiring the replacement of lead service, lines, goosenecks,and other lead distribution system piping to control lead in drinking water.The Agency has estimated that there are approximately 4.4 million leadservice lines in use in the U.S. and that about 25 percent of all publicwater suppliers have at least some lead service lines. The number of leadservice lines as a percentage of total service lines in any community withlead services varies from one percent to 80 percent (Chin and Karalekas,1984). While most cities stopped installing lead services after about 1940,at least one large city (Chicago) continue to require their use until late1986.Lead service lines can contribute significantly to lead levels in tap water,especially where water is corrosive. In Karalekas et al. (1976), for example,lead levels in samples from lead service lines (called ``early morningsamples'' in this study) averaged 0.104 mg/1 as compared to morning firstdraw levels (called ``standing samples'') in those same homes which averaged0.053 mg/1. Similarly, Pocock (1980) and the U.K. Department of the environment(1982) found an elevation in lead levels in morning first draw samplesin homes without interior lead plumbing but with lead service lines (called``communication pipe'' in Pocock); these first draw levels were lower thanin homes with interior lead plumbing and higher than in homes without anylead pipes (either as interior plumbing or as service lines). Because leadservice lines can raise lead levels at the tap, and for reasons relatedto system operation and maintenance (e.g., to avoid anticipated pipe failures),several communities around the United States have already begun programsto replace lead service lines.The studies cited above as well as unpublished data from two other cities(see Tables 8 and 9) indicate that not all houses with lead service lineshave high lead levels at the tap, expecially where water is relativelynon-corrosive. The reasons for this vary. One possible explanation is thatover time an insoluble protective coating can build up on the interiorsurface of the lead pipe, preventing (or reducing) the leaching of leadinto the water. The buildup of this film is subject to conditions thatcan vary from house to house including the age of the plumbing, the occurrenceof physical disturbances such as the ground freezing or nearby road repair,fluctuations in pH or water pressure, and the length and diameter of thelead pipe. Another possible explanation is that the samples taken in someof these studies may not have fully captured the contribution from thelead service line, e.g., if morning first draw samples, rather than serviceline samples, were taken (morning first draw samples are not a reliablepredictor of the contribution from the service line). This can be seenin the Karalekas, et al. (1976) data cited above: the service line samples,which were intended to capture the effect of the lead pipes on tap water,showed the highest lead levels. In the Pocock (1980) data as well, thepresence of lead service lines raised the morning first draw lead levelsonly slightly. Given the available data, EPA cannot currently quantify,on a national basis, the contributions of lead service lines and otherlead connections to lead levels at the tap, or the anticipated change inlead levels after corrosion control treatment is in place. EPA solicitsdata to help clarify this issue.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>8._<T4>Average Lead Concentration for Lead vs Non-Lead Service Lines \1\</T4>,\2\<H1>City</H1><H1>Pipe type</H1><H1>pH</H1><H1>Alk \3\</H1><H1>Morning first draw average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Service line average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Fully flushed average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Number of sampes</H1><H1>Vol.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chicago<D>Lead</D><D>8.3</D><D>109</D><D>13</D><D>15</D><D>8</D><D>201</D><D>500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Iron</D><D>8.3</D><D>109</D><D>3</D><D/><D>andless;3</D><D>73</D><D>500</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Louisville<D>Lead</D><D>8.6</D><D/><D>8</D><D>5</D><D>3</D><D>34</D><D>250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Copper</D><D>8.4</D><D/><D>9</D><D>3</D><D>2</D><D>12</D><D>250</D><ITAG tagnum="1">St. Louis<D>Lead</D><D>9.0</D><D>50</D><D>andless;1</D><D>andless;1</D><D>andless;1</D><D>2</D><D>1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Copper</D><D>9.0</D><D>50</D><D>4</D><D>3</D><D>andless;1</D><D>9</D><D>1,000</D><F>\1\ Source: EPA, 1988</F><T3>h.</T3><F>\2\ Values are for reported sample sizes.</F><F>\3\ Alk=alkalinity in mg/l as CaCO</F><T2>3</T2>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>9,L2,i1,s50,r50,10,10,10,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Table </T4>9._<T4>Range of Lead Concentration for Lead vs. Non-Lead Service Lines \1\</T4>,\2\<H1>City</H1><H1>Pipe type</H1><H1>pH</H1><H1>Alk \3\</H1><H1>Morning first draw average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Service line average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Fully flushed average (Pb in andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Number of samples</H1><H1>Vol.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chicago<D>Lead</D><D>8.3</D><D>109</D><D>andless;3-85</D><D>andless;3-127</D><D>andless;3-44</D><D>201</D><D>500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Iron</D><D>8.3</D><D>109</D><D>andless;3-6</D><D/><D>andless;3</D><D>73</D><D>500</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Louisville<D>Lead</D><D>8.6</D><D/><D>ND-29</D><D>ND-15</D><D>ND-15</D><D>34</D><D>250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Copper</D><D>8.4</D><D/><D>ND-19</D><D>ND-7</D><D>ND-5</D><D>12</D><D>250</D><ITAG tagnum="1">St. Louis<D>Lead</D><D>9.0</D><D>50</D><D>andless;1</D><D>andless;1</D><D>andless;1</D><D>2</D><D>1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Copper</D><D>9.0</D><D>50</D><D>andless;1-13</D><D>1-10</D><D>andless;1</D><D>9</D><D>1,000</D><F>\1\ Source: EPA, 1988</F><T3>h.</T3><F>\2\ Values are for reported sample sizes.</F><F>\3\ Alk=alkalinity in mg/l as CaCO</F><T2>3</T2>.</ITAG>A further complication of the pipe replacement issue is that ownershipand/or control of the service line often is split between the public watersystem and the property owner. Depending on State law or regulations orlocal ordinances, some public water systems own and/or control servicelines and other connections up to the property line, others own and/orcontrol the service line and other connections up to the building (especiallyif the water meter is located inside the building), and still others ownand/or control the service line and other connections only up to the curb.(See Figure 1 for a schematic drawing of the parts of the water supplyand distribution system.)EPA believes that, in general, its authority to require replacement ofservice lines and other connections ends where the water supplier ownershipor control of the lines end. EPA has conducted a limited study of somelarge cities, which indicates that these water suppliers generally limitmaintenance on water pipes to those portions they own (EPA 1987d). However,several cities have authority to enter private property to perform workon water lines under special circumstances (EPA 1988j); in such cases,the property owner is generally billed for the work performed.Several cities currently conduct programs to accelerate the replacementof portions of the lead services and goosenecks under their control. SanFrancisco, CA, began a program in the early 1960's, and replaces approximately11,500 linear feet of service line per year at an average cost of $40 perlinear foot. The service line from the water main to the water meter isreplaced with polybutylene, copper, or ductile iron, depending on linediameter. New Haven, CT, has replaced all lead and galvanized steel servicelines (from the water main to the meter) and began accelerated replacementof lead gooseneck connections in 1976-77. New Haven has replaced 15,000of an original 30,000 lead goosenecks to date, at a rate of about 1,000per year. Akron, OH began replacing lead and galvanized steel service linesfrom the water main to the curb in 1964, and has replaced about 1,000 servicelines per year since then. In all of these cases, the service line replacementwas funded by operating revenues paid by the customers. Washington, DChas a program under which they city will replace its portion of lead servicelines provided that the building owner replaces his or her portion.While many studies indicate that lead service connections can contributeto tap water levels of lead, EPA currently has no data to quantify theextent of reductions in lead levels that might be achievable by partialreplacement (i.e., by replacing only that portion under the ownership and/orcontrol of the PWS). One study (Britton and Richards, 1980) found temporaryincreases in lead levels at the tap following the replacement of part ofa lead service line with copper piping. As the authors noted, this probablyresulted from the dislodgement of the protective coating on the insideof the pipe, possibly aggravated by the application of new lead solderto connect the new pipe, and the occurrence of galvanic corrosion relatedto the introduction of a dissimilar metal. Because EPA does not have theauthority to require the replacement of lead service lines owned and controlledby private property owners, the Agency is concerned that a requirementto replace lead service lines would result in only partial replacementof many such lines. EPA solicits any available data on the effect of partialand full lead service line replacement programs on lead levels at the tap.EPA also solicits information on the extent of the authority of publicwater systems over lead service lines and connections under State law andlocal ordinances.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Public Education About Lead in Drinking Water</ITAG>EPA has conducted public education programs and has found that well designedand implemented programs can be an effective means of reducing public exposuresto environmental hazards. Public education programs have effectively changedthe knowledge and/or behavior of their audiences. Examples of such programsare the State and EPA radon programs and programs to educate residentsnear Superfund sites about the degree of hazard presented by improperlydisposed chemicals at these sites.Since 1986 EPA has sponsored a major program to educate the public aboutthe dangers of exposure to radon. Many elements of this program have actuallybeen carried out by State and local governments. The program has includedmonitoring of homes and other buildings for radon in the air, and developmentand testing of innovative exposure reduction methods, including both preventionand removal techniques. Information has been conveyed throughout the communitythrough an ongoing program of pamphlets, public service announcements,television specials, public meetings, and other means. As a result of thisprogram, many people have become aware of the effects of exposure to radonon health and have taken steps to determine their exposure and protectthemselves.A second successful public education program deals with health risks associatedwith specific hazardous waste disposal sites under CERCLA (Superfund).Federal, State, and local governments, together with private parties, provideintensive information to people living or working near hazardous wastesites. Using the methods discussed above, affected persons have learnedabout the nature of the dangers they may face and have learned appropriatesteps to reduce their current and possible future exposures to contaminantsat these hazardous waste sites.All public education programs have two basic elements: the content of theprogram and the method of delivering the information.a. <T3>Content of the Program.</T3> An effective public education programfor lead in drinking water includes information about:(a) The health reasons for concern about lead exposure, including identificationof sensitive subpopulations;(b) Sources of lead exposure (including non-drinking water sources) anda plan to identify the sources of specific problems in individual housesthat are identified as having lead levels above a maximum value; (c) Means of reducing lead exposure from drinking water, including tapflushing and suggestions for modifying water use patterns to conserve watergiven the benefits of flushing. b. <T3>Conveyance of Message. </T3>The effectiveness of public education programsvaries depending upon how the message is conveyed to the community in generaland to key groups in the community. For example, bill enclosures, publicservice announcements, pubilic meetings, and messages on water bills willvary in effectiveness since they present the message in different waysand to different consumers. Identification of key groups in the community can be important in improvingthe effectiveness of public education programs in reducing exposure tolead by targeting them for more intensive public education efforts. Keygroups can include residence in areas identified as at risk for high leadlevels in drinking water or houses that actually have been tested and foundto have high lead levels; schools and other buildings that have a highproportion of children in their population; and institutions that may servea high proportion of pregnant women. Finally, the frequency and duration of the various aspects of a publiceducation program can influence its success. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Selection of Treatment Technique Requirements for Controlling CorrosionBy-Products</ITAG>In the above discussion, EPA has reviewed three potential methods of reducinglead and copper as corrosion by-products in drinking water: Corrosion controltreatment, pipe replacement, and public education. Based on its evaluationof the available information, EPA considers corrosion control and publiceducation to be effective and feasible methods of reducing lead and copperas corrosion by-products in drinking water. Thus, they are both includedas requirements of the proposed rule. Lead service line replacement wasalso considered. EPA believes that in many cases replacement of lead servicelines and connections may reduce the lead levels in tap water. However,there may be temporary risks associated with partial pipe replacement.Because of these potential risks, as well as uncertainty about the effectivenessof partial or complete service line replacement as a final control stepafter implementation of corrosion control treatment, EPA is not proposingservice line replacement as BAT for controlling lead as a corrosion by-productin drinking water. However, as explained below, EPA is requesting commentand data on this subject and is considering adopting pipe replacement asa requirement of the final rule. E. Proposed RegulationEPA is proposing an MCL for lead in distributed water of 0.005 mg/l andan MCL for copper in distributed water of 1.3 mg/l. Compliance would bemeasured at the entry point to the distribution system. The Agency is also proposing a treatment technique requirement to controllead and copper which enters water as corrosion by-products. The proposedtreatment technique consists of optimal corrosion control treatment tominimize lead corrosion, and public education. It would be triggered bythree ``no-action'' levels, as measured in targeted samples: an averagelead concentration in targeted samples of less than or equal to 0.010 mg/l,a copper concentration of 1.3 mg/l or less in at least 95 percent of thetargeted samples, and pH greater than or equal to 8.0 in at least 95 percentof the targeted samples. If all three levels are met, ``no action'' wouldbe required; the PWS would be deemed in compliance with the treatment technique.If any of these three levels is not met by a system, the system would berequired to install or improve its corrosion control treatment. In addition,if the average lead level of 0.010 mg/l or a fourth ``no-action'' leadlevel of 0.020 mg/l or less (in at least 95 percent of the targeted samplestaken for compliance) was exceeded, the PWS would be required to conducta public education program to encourage consumers to reduce their exposuresto lead in drinking water. The Agency is seeking comment on six major alternatives which are permutationsof this proposal. First, EPA is considering treating the fourth no-actionlevel, 0.020 mg/l or less of lead in at least 95 percent of the targetedsamples, the same as the first three no-action levels. Thus, a system thatdid not meet this fourth no-action level would be required to install orimprove its corrosion control treatment. The second alternative would addan additional ``no-action level'' of total alkalinity greater than or equalto 30 mg/l in 95 percent of more samples to trigger treatment. As in thefirst alternative, a system that did not meet this no-action level wouldbe required to install or improve corrosion control treatment. The thirdalternative would eliminate the pH no-action level and rely only on leadlevels measured at the tap to determine whether corrosion control treatmentis required. Under the fourth alternative EPA is considering, a systemwould be required to replace lead service lines and connections that werefound to contribute 0.005 mg/l lead or more to lead levels in tap watereven after installation of optimal corrosion control treatment. The fifthalternative under consideration is a two-tier approach to monitoring whichcould increase the efficiency of sampling and accuracy of determinationsregarding whether additional corrosion control treatment was required.This alternative may also reduce the number of samples required of largerpublic water systems. A sixth alternative EPA is considering would eliminatethe MCLs for lead and copper in distributed water. This section and the following section on monitoring describe each partof the proposal and these alternatives, and explains the rationale forselecting the proposed rule provisions and for considering each alternative.EPA requests comment on the proposal itself, as well as the alternatives.In response to the public comments, EPA may promulgate any of these alternativeoptions or any combination of these options. Persons should, accordingly,comment fully on all these options. In its July 8, 1987 (52 FR 12876) notice promulgating NPDWRs for eightVOCs, EPA added a definition of a non-transient non-community (NTNC) watersystem to the general definitions section in 40 CFR andSection;141.2. Thedefinition of a non-transient non-community water system is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">a ``non-transient non-community water system'' means a public watersystem that is not a community water system and that regularly serves atleast 25 of the same persons over six months per year. </ITAG>In that rulemaking, EPA applied the NPDWRs for the VOCs to these NTNC watersystems. EPA also stated in that notice its intent to apply future drinkingwater standards to NTNC water systems. Accordingly, EPA is proposing toapply the NPDWRs for lead and copper proposed in today's notice to NTNCwater systems as well as to community water systems. EPA recognizes thatsome of the provisions of the proposed regulations would not easily applyto NTNC systems. Therefore, where appropriate, EPA is proposing modifiedprovisions for NTNC water systems to better suit the special circumstancesof the NTNC system. Unless otherwise noted, all requirements in this proposalwould apply to community water systems and NTNC water suppliers in thesame way. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Lead and Copper MCLs </ITAG>Based on the analysis of treatment technologies in Section IV.B.3., above,and an assessment of the PQL in Section V.A., below, EPA is proposing anMCL of 0.005 mg/l for lead in water as the water enters the distributionsystem. The treatment technologies proposed as BAT in Section IV.B.3.,(i.e., ion exchange, reverse osmosis, lime softening, and coagulation/filtration)can reduce lead occurring in source water to 0.005 mg/l at reasonable cost.Based on an analysis of the same treatment technologies, EPA proposes toset an MCL for copper in water entering the distribution system of 1.3mg/l. The treatment technologies proposed as BAT in Section IV.B.3. arecapable of reducing copper found in source water to this level at reasonablecost. EPA considered making these MCLs applicable to fully flushed water at thetap, rather than to treated water entering the distribution system. However,EPA is concerned that distribution system and household plumbing materialsmight contribute to fully flushed lead levels at the tap as water movesthrough the pipes, and tap levels therefore may not reflect the effectiveapplication of treatment to reduce lead and copper occurring in sourcewater. Although EPA has few data on such contributions, especially on contributionsafter application of the corrosion control treatment which would be requiredby this rule, the available data indicate that plumbing materials can contributeto lead and copper levels in fully flushed samples (EPA, 1988h). Therefore, EPA is proposing to require that compliance with the MCLs forlead and copper be measured at the entry point(s) to the distribution system.Water suppliers with more than one well or entry point to the distributionsystem would be required to monitor at each entry point to ensure identificationof all sources requiring treatment. Where several wells draw from the sameaquifer, States would be allowed to identify wells representative of theaquifer for monitoring if there is no treatment; monitoring of the remainingwells would not be required. States would also be allowed to reduce thetotal number of samples by the use of composite samples, described in SectionV.C.1. below. Measuring at the entry point to the distribution system would accuratelyreflect whether the treatment of the source water was effectively applied.While contributions to the lead and copper content of fully flushed waterfrom plumbing materials in the distribution system may be small, even acontribution of 0.001 mg/l from corrosion could result in a violation ofthe lead MCL when in fact the source water has been treated to reduce leadlevels in the source water to below the MCL. A larger contribution wouldbe required for copper, but the same concern exists. EPA solicits commentson both the proposed approach and the alternative of requiring that theMCLs apply to fully flushed water at the consumer's tap.To demonstrate compliance with the MCL for lead, water suppliers wouldbe required to monitor lead in water entering the distribution system andmaintain the lead level at or below 0.005 mg/l in all samples. To be incompliance with the MCL for copper, water suppliers would be required tomonitor copper levels in water entering the distribution system and maintainthe copper level at or below 1.3 mg/l in all samples. These requirementswould apply to both community water systems and non-transient, non-communitywater systems. Monitoring would begin no later than the dates specifiedin Section V.C.1 (depending on system size).It has been suggested that an MCL for contaminants entering the distributionsystem is a contradiction in terms because an MCL, by definition, is astandard that must be met at the tap. Proponents of this view argue thatthe SDWA, the legislative history of the Act, and EPA's own regulationssupport this interpretation.The Safe Drinking Water Act defines an MCL as ``the maximum permissiblelevel of a contaminant in water which is delivered to any user of a publicwater system.'' Section 1401(3). It certainly could be argued that, underthis definition, MCLs must be met in water that actually flows from theuser's tap. Indeed, the House Report on the bill that eventually becamethe Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 states that ``[s]ince drinking waterregulations are intended to be met at the consumer's tap, the committeeanticipates that monitoring would include tap sampling.'' (H.R. Rep. No.93-1185, p. 13, 1974). On the other hand, it could be argued that ``waterwhich is delivered to any user'' refers to water that leaves the part ofthe distribution system that is owned or controlled by the public watersystem and enters the portion of the distribution system that is ownedor controlled by the user, e.g., homeowner. This interpretation would beconsistent with the definition of ``public water system'' in section 1401(4)of the Act which, as discussed earlier, does not include distribution facilitiesthat are not owned or controlled by the public water system.In determining where MCLs apply, EPA's regulations are not conclusive.In 40 CFR 141.2(c), EPA defines ``maximum contaminant level'' as:<ITAG tagnum="20">the maximum permissible level of a contaminant in water which is deliveredto the free flowing outlet of the ultimate user of a public water system,except in the case of turbidity where the maximum permissible level ismeasured at the point of entry to the distribution system. Contaminantsadded to the water under circumstances controlled by the user, except thoseresulting from corrosion of piping and plumbing caused by water quality,are excluded from this definition.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The ``free flowing outlet of the ultimate consumer of a public watersystem'' apparently refers to the user's tap. Under this interpretation,all MCLs, except the MCL for turbidity, apply at the tap. However, manyof the NPDWRs the Agency has promulgated appear inconsistent with thisdefinition because they do not require monitoring, and therefore compliance,at the user's tap. For instance, the NPDWR for coliform bacteria requiresthat ``samples * * * be taken at points which are representative of theconditions within the distribution system.'' 40 CFR 141.21(a). While thisprovision does not preclude sampling at the consumer's tap, it does notrequire it. Some NPDWRs actually preclude compliance monitoring at thetap. For instance, in 40 CFR 141.24(g)(1), the NPDWRs for VOCs that EPApromulgated in 1987 state that ``[g]round water systems shall sample atpoints of entry to the distribution system representative of each well.''Also, the NPDWR for fluoride requires sampling at the entry points to thedistribution system. 40 CFR 141.23(g)(1). Other NPDWRs are silent; forinstance, most of the NPDWRs for inorganic contaminants (other than fluoride)do not specify the sampling (or compliance) point. See 40 CFR 141.23.Of course, for contaminants other than corrosion byproducts, sampling atthe tap is not critical since water leaving a treatment plant is generallyexpected to remain consistent in quality throughout the distribution system,including the portion owned or controlled by the consumer. In fact, forsome contaminants, the level at the tap may even be lower than the levelat the entry point to the distribution system because of dilution (e.g.,mixing of sources) or volatilization of contaminants from water.Thus, EPA's regulatory definition of MCL arguably is inconsistent withboth the statutory definitions of ``MCL'' and ``public water system'' andthe monitoring requirements for many current MCLs. EPA believes it is importantto clarify that, for all contaminants regulated under the Safe DrinkingWater Act, the point of compliance is defined by the monitoring requirementsof each NPDWR. Therefore, in this notice, EPA is proposing to amend thedefinition of ``maximum contaminant level'' to match the statutory definition.Then, for each NPDWR that specifies an MCL, the Agency will specify themonitoring requirements, including the sampling locations, which will inturn define the point of compliance. In the case of the lead and copperMCLs, therefore, the sampling point and point of compliance would be theentry point to the distribution system. While these levels may not necessarilybe the ``maximum levels delivered to any user,'' because lead and/or copperlevels will probably increase from corrosion within the distribution system,these MCLs, measured as specified in the proposed rule, (1) would indicatewhether the treatment for lead and copper in source water was effective,and (2) assess the minimum lead and copper levels that can occur at thetap. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Requirement for Lead and Copper as Corrosion By-Products</ITAG>The treatment technique required by this rule consists of optimal corrosioncontrol treatment (to minimize lead and copper leaching) and public education(to reduce exposure to lead). Systems could comply with the treatment techniqueeither by installing treatment and conducting a public education program,or by meeting specified ``no-action levels'' for parameters of concern.Thus, under this proposal, systems that meet specified levels for lead,copper, and pH, i.e., no-action levels, would be deemed in compliance withthe treatment technique requirement and would not be required to installor improve treatment of their water. Systems that do not meet the no-actionlevels would be required to either improve or install corrosion controltreatment adequate to meet the no-action levels or else demonstrate thatthey have optimized treatment, i.e., that the delivered water is minimallycorrosive towards lead. In addition, if one or both lead no-action levelsare exceeded, the system would be required to conduct a public educationprogram.EPA is proposing no-action levels as a screen to limit the total numberof public water systems which would need to make a detailed demonstrationthat they have optimized corrosion control treatment. These limits arecalled ``no-action levels'' because no further actions are required ifthey are met. Thus, under this proposal, a system that meets the no-actionlevels, i.e., 95 percent of samples at the tap with pH 8, lead levels atthe tap of 0.010 mg/l or below as an average, and 95 percent of copperlevels at the tap of 1.3 mg/l or below, would be considered to have minimallycorrosive water and would be considered in compliance with the corrosioncontrol portion of the treatment technique requirement. Such a system wouldnot be required to perform a detailed demonstration that it had installedoptimal corrosion control treatment. A system that meets the average of0.010 mg/l of lead and 95 percent or more of its samples are less thanor equal to 0.020 mg/l lead would be considered to be in compliance withthe public education portion of the treatment technique requirement.To determine whether it meets the no-action levels, the water system wouldfirst take morning first draw and service connection samples from kitchentaps in targeted residences as described in Section V.B.2. below. For systemsserving more than 3,300 people, the first round of monitoring (four quarters)would be required to be completed during the 15 months after promulgationof the final rule. Water suppliers serving 500 to 3,300 people would have27 months from promulgation to complete the initial monitoring. Systemsserving fewer than 500 people would be required to complete the initialmonitoring 39 months after promulgation of the final regulations. Non-transientnon-community water systems would be required to complete their requiredmonitoring according to this schedule, depending on the number of peopleserved by the system. All other time deadlines are expressed in terms oftime elapsed since the deadline for completion of the initial monitoring.These requirements are summarized in Figure 2. The remainder of this sectiondescribes these requirements in more detail.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2650</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Systems failing to meet the no-action levels by the deadline for completionof the initial monitoring would be required to install corrosion controltreatment, and/or public education, depending on which of the no-actionlevels is exceeded. Corrosion control treatment and public education wouldbe required to be implemented according to a State-approved or issued treatmentplan. The treatment plan would contain specific steps that each water supplierwould be required to take to ensure that either the no-action levels aremet, or optimal corrosion control treatment and/or public education areimplemented, on a specified schedule. All systems would be required tocomplete installation of any treatment required by the treatment plan withinthree years after approval of the plan.Water systems serving 3,300 or more people and failing to meet anyone ofthe no-action levels would be required to apply for approval of a treatmentplan by submitting a proposed treatment plan to the State within one yearafter the deadline for completion of the initial monitoring. These systemswould required to include in their treatment plan the following steps:(1) Design and implementation of pipe loop, laboratory, pilot scale and/orfield studies; (2) analysis of the data generated in these studies to estimateoptimal operating conditions to minimize corrosion of lead; (3) installationof the treatment in the entire water supply system; (4) monitoring to evaluatethe effectiveness of the treatment; (5) additional adjustment of the treatmentif no-action levels continues to be exceeded; and (6) if, after installationand adjustment of treatment, any of the no-action levels continue to beexceeded, submission to the State of all data collected and an analysisdemonstrating that the corrosion control treatment being applied was optimal,i.e., that lead levels were minimized.The State would be required to review the system's analysis and determinewhether treatment was optimal. Once the State determines that treatmentis optimal, the State would also specify required operating parametersand values (such as pH, total alkalinity, or corrosion inhibitor dose rateor residual) to ensure that optimal treatment continues. These operatingparameters may vary by season to account for seasonal variations in watercorrosivity. States would be expected to periodically review and revisethe specified operating parameters if long-term monitoring shows increasingaverage lead levels, or that different values for the specified parametersresult in lower lead levels.Water systems serving fewer than 3,300 people would be required to applyto the State for a treatment plan if any of the no-action levels is exceededat the end of the initial monitoring period. Systems would be requiredto submit or apply for the plan within one year after the close of theinitial monitoring period. States would specify the required corrosioncontrol treatment in the treatment plans for these systems. The treatmentplans would include a schedule for completion of Steps 3-6 described abovefor systems serving more than 3,300 persons. States would also specifyfinal operating parameters for these systems after treatment is appliedand follow-up monitoring conducted. EPA is proposing that States specifythe appropriate treatment for these systems because most smaller systemsare unlikely to have the resources and expertise necessary for determiningwhat corrosion control treatment is appropriate. However, systems thatwish to develop and submit their own treatment plan rather than requestone from the State are encouraged to do so.a. <T3>Corrosion Control_</T3>i. <T3>No-Action Levels.</T3>As described above, if pH is 8.0 or greater (in 95 percent of targetedsamples), lead levels in targeted samples have an arithmetic average of0.010 mg/l or lower, the maximum lead level in 95 percent of targeted samplesdoes not exceed 0.002 mg/l, and the copper levels in 95 percent of targetedsamples does not exceed 1.3 mg/l, the system would be deemed in compliancewith the treatment technique requirement and need not install or improvecorrosion control treatment.The value of 0.010 mg/l as an arithmetic average for lead levels is basedon engineering considerations. EPA reviewed the available literature anddata on lead levels in standing samples (water standing in the pipes 8-18hours), compared with the various plumbing materials water quality factors(particularly pH and alkalinity) present. Analysis of these data indicatesthat, for those water suppliers having water with pH 8 and total alkalinitygreater than 30 mg/l, even in the presence of some lead plumbing materials,average tap lead levels of 0.010 mg/l were achieved.Systems with no lead problem or only a small lead problem (e.g., no leadservice lines and few houses with new lead solder) would be able to meetthe average of 0.010 mg/l relatively easily, especially if they meet theno-action level for pH. Some systems may have more difficulty consistentlymeeting the average. For example, as described above, Boston, MA and Bennington,VT have had serious lead problems in the past due to large numbers of leadservice lines and residences with interior lead plumbing combined withwater which was extremely corrosive before treatment, and thus have institutedcorrosion control programs aimed at reducing lead to below 0.050 mg/l.Both raised their pH to above 8.0 at the treatment plant, and Benningtonraised its raised their alkalinity some. Because alkalinity levels remainlow, pH levels are not maintained throughout the system. Although bothcommunities achieved substantial reductions in morning first draw leadlevels, and met their own program goals of reducing tap lead levels below0.050 mg/l, neither is meeting the 0.010 mg/l target as an average. However,the treatments developed for these cities may not be optimal for theirwater; additional reductions are likely to be possible.The proposed treatment technique requirement would include a no-actionlevel for copper equal to the MCLG, 1.3 mg/l, as a 95th percentile of thedata in morning first draw water. This level is based on a review of theliterature and data on copper levels in morning first draw samples. Thesedata indicate that with good corrosion control, particularly pH adjustment,copper levels in morning first draw water can be consistently reduced tothe MCLG or lower (EPA, 1988h).ii. <T3>Treatment Plan Requirements. </T3>If a water supplier did not meetone or more no-action levels, it would be required to submit or apply for(depending on their size) a treatment plan. The plan would be designedto result in having the system meet the no-action levels or, if the systemdid not meet the pH and/or average lead level after applying optimal treatment,demonstrate that lead levels in tap water had been minimized. (The treatmentplan would also include public education requirements if the average ormaximum lead level is not met. This aspect of the treatment plan is discussedin a later section.) Systems must submit or apply for a treatment planwithin one year after the end of the initial monitoring period showingthat any no-action level has been missed.The contents of the plan, including items such as specific schedules, studies,and installation of treatment, would become effective and enforceable uponapproval or issuance of the plan by the State. Factors affecting the scopeand detail necessary for successful optimization showings include: Localwater chemistry conditions, size and complexity of the distribution system,and the presence of other water treatments which can affect the designand effectiveness of potential corrosion control measures. Compliance wouldbe determined based on whether a system had fulfilled each step of theapproved plan on time and in a manner meeting minimum Federal and Statecriteria.After the system has taken all the steps required by the plan, the Statewould evaluate the results and specify operating conditions for futurecompliance. The system would be required to operate in the manner specifiedby the State (either meeting the no-action levels or operating under otherconditions approved by the State that minimize the corrosivity of the watertowards lead) to remain in compliance in future monitoring periods. Failureto meet the no-action levels or demonstrate that treatment is optimal wouldbe a violation of the treatment technique requirement. Systems that meetall the no-action levels during the initial monitoring period, but exceedone or more of them during a subsequent monitoring period, would have oneyear after their monitoring data showed an exceedance of any no-actionlevel to either meet the no-action level or submit or apply for a treatmentplan.(A) <T3>Large and Medium Size Systems. </T3>Systems serving more than 3,300persons would be required to submit a proposed plan which describes thesystem's approach to obtaining the information necessary to install orimprove treatment sufficient to achieve the no-action levels or to demonstratethat corrosion control treatment has minimized lead levels at the tap dueto corrosion. EPA expects that water suppliers facing situations more complicatedthan average, such as large systems, would need to perform more elaboratestudies to determine optimal operating conditions. A simpler than averageevaluation may suffice in cases where the choice of appropriate corrosioncontrol is fairly obvious. The treatment plan for these systems would includethe following specific steps and a schedule for completing each step:<T3>Step 1: </T3>Pipe loop, laboratory, pilot scale studies, and/or fieldstudies demonstrating reductions in lead and copper levels in actual orsimulated standing samples corresponding to application of optimal corrosioncontrol treatment.To identify and demonstrate to the State that water is minimally corrosivetowards lead or achieve the no-action levels, water suppliers would berequired to conduct pipe loop, laboratory, pilot-scale, and/or field studiesinvestigating the effects of changes in corrosion control treatment andcorresponding changes in lead dissolution. These studies should includeinvestigations of the effects of varying pH over the range of 8.0 to 10.0,and at several total alkalinity levels.Those ground water systems with pH below 8.0 that are saturated or nearlysaturated with CaCO<T2>3</T2>, and that wish to continue operating in the pH range, shoulddemonstrate in the laboratory that precipitation problems could occur ifpH adjustment is implemented. If these bench-scale studies indicate thatCaCO<T2>3</T2> would precipitate at elevated pH, then these systems shouldconcentrate their optimization analysis on the use of corrosion inhibitorssuch as zinc orthophosphate. In addition, systems which prefer to operate outside the required pH rangebecause of other water treatment considerations (such as preference forusing corrosion inhibitors, which function better at lower pH, e.g., pHandless;8.0, so formation of trihalomethanes and other disinfection by-productsis less likely) also could apply for treatment plan approval. Systems thatwant to operate outside the minimum pH must also describe use of any corrosioninhibitors which provide optimum protection outside the preferred pH range,and show in pipe loop or other studies approved by the State in the treatmentplan that lead levels under these conditions are higher than lead levelswhich result under the water supplier's preferred operating conditions.The supplier must test a range of corrosion inhibitor doses and sufficientalternative operating conditions to show that the lead levels cannot belowered using other treatments such as alternative corrosion inhibitors.If a pipe loop study is used to evaluate different treatments, then thepipes used for the study must be representative of the plumbing in thesystem that is causing the lead problem. Lead pipes would be required iflead service connections are used within the system. Lead-soldered copperjoints must be used if the lead problem is the result of corrosion of thesejoints within the system. Because of differences in conditions betweenresidences and pipe loops, the loops will generally not predict the precisetreatment necessary and resultant lead levels for a system. However, theywill accurately predict trends and provide data to plan a treatment strategyand to design and test pilot and field scale studies, as part of the treatmentscale-up and adjustment. <T3>Step 2:</T3> Analysis of the data generated in Step 1 above to identifywater quality conditions under which lead levels in morning first drawand service connection samples (i.e., standing samples) are expected tobe minimized. The purpose of the studies conducted under the treatment plan is to identifywater quality conditions under which corrosion of lead into tap water isminimized and to demonstrate that lead levels in water have been minimizedunder the operating conditions for which the water supplier seeks approval(if it cannot meet the no-action levels after installing or improving treatment).The results of the studies should clearly and unambiguously show the relationshipbetween minimal water lead content and the proposed operating conditions.That is, data gathered under both the operating conditions identified bythe water supplier as optimal and alternative conditions would be required.The State would evaluate the data to assure that the chosen conditionsprovide the lowest possible lead levels. In conducting these studies, there may be a period before the full effectof the pH adjustment is expected to be realized. The system would analyzestanding samples from the pipe loop or other experimental set up for leadduring this period to assess the effectiveness of the pH adjustment. Thosesystems that do not meet the average lead level at any of the pHs withinthe specified range (i.e., 8-10) would then analyze the generated datato determine the optimum pH, i.e., the pH which results in the lowest leadlevels. The system would then adjust the pH to the optimum pH and establishpermanent operating levels for pH and any other parameters specified bythe State. For systems which choose to investigate corrosion inhibitors, lead levelsresulting from a range of doses would be required, and would be comparedwith the results of studies using pH adjustment above. Based on these analyses, a treatment strategy and estimated operating parametersfor minimizing corrosivity of water in the whole system would be identified.<T3>Step 3:</T3> Installation and operation of corrosion control treatmentin the water system as a whole. EPA anticipates that most of the overall demonstration of optimal treatmentwould be completed in the laboratory or in a pilot plant as part of Step1. Only after a PWS has determined the general requirements for treatmentwould EPA expect it to apply the treatment in the distribution system.EPA believes this sequential process is important to assure that protectivecoatings are not accidentally disturbed during the trials, and to allowsystems to make cost-efficient decisions regarding treatment strategiesand the installation of new equipment. The system would be required to scale up its laboratory treatment to installit in the system as a whole within three years of approval of the treatmentplan. The goal of the scale-up would be to identify full scale treatmentthat would achieve in the system as a whole the operating parameters identifiedin Step 2 above as likely optimal operating parameters, or to meet theno-action levels. <T3>Step 4:</T3> Monitoring to determine the efficacy of the treatmentas installed. The treatment plan must require monitoring of the full-scale implementationof the operating conditions determined from the laboratory and pilot studies.Monitoring would be required at the same sites used to evaluate compliancewith the no-action levels. Systems adjusting pH (and alkalinity) may have a several-month stabilizationperiod before the full effect of the corrosion control treatment is realized.The pH level will stabilize first, while lead levels may continue to fallas a film builds up on the inside of the pipes. Systems should sample atthe targeted sites during this period to determine the effectiveness ofthe corrosion control treatment. This monitoring should show lead levelsdecreasing and stabilizing over time as the treatment takes effect. Oncethe system has stabilized, samples from the targeted sites would be analyzedfor lead to demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment at full scale.<T3>Step 5:</T3> Adjustment of the installed treatment as necessary toensure that lead levels are minimized. Once the general treatment steps are determined and installed to treatthe full system to meet the water quality parameters identified, EPA expectsthat most water suppliers would need to fine-tune the treatment to accountfor normal differences between laboratory or pilot plant designs and fullscale operations. The installed treatment must also be adjusted for seasonalvariations in water quality which can greatly affect the corrosivity ofthe water. Water suppliers must adjust the installed treatment as necessaryto account for differences between projections based on laboratory or pilotplant data and full-scale operations by performing minor adjustments orpH or other parameters to try to reduce the lead levels. If, upon implementation of the operating parameters identified by the systemin the laboratory studies, a system meets the no-action levels for fourconsecutive quarters, then the system has adjusted its corrosion controltreatment sufficiently and no further adjustment would be required. Note that because tap water must meet the proposed no-action levels orbe shown to be minimally corrosive towards lead, water suppliers wouldbe required to adjust corrosion control treatment to account for any blendingof water from different sources. There can be significant changes in waterchemistry associated with blending. Therefore, suppliers must demonstratethat each blended product meets the requirements of the regulations. Arelated issue is that of the division of responsibility for treatment amongwholesalers and retailers of water. Retailers may add or blend sourcesof water provided by several wholesalers. Therefore, EPA is proposing toplace ultimate responsibility for the degree of corrosivity of the wateron the retailers. EPA solicits comment on this approach and requests datato support any alternative approaches suggested. <T3>Step 6:</T3> If any no-action levels are still exceeded after installingor improving treatment and making all adjustments, systems must submitto the State an analysis of all treatment and resulting lead levels demonstratingthat treatment is optimal and lead levels are minimized for the specificsystem. This report would include a compilation of all the data generated in thecourse of study and treatment implementation. It must clearly show thatadditional treatment would not reduce lead levels further. Test resultsoutside the operating parameters identified as optimal must be included.Once the State accepts the analysis and approves a set of operating conditionsas optimal, those conditions would become the required operating parametersfor that system for the future. Suppliers serving more than 3,300 persons that wish to change other concurrenttreatments that might reduce the effectiveness of the approved corrosioncontrol treatment, or experience significant change in the population servedor in the extent of the distribution system, would be required to submitto the State for approval new corrosion control data from studies whichreflected the new conditions under which the supplier wishes to operate.These conditions must show that corrosion of lead continues to be minimized.(B) <T3>Small Systems.</T3> Systems serving fewer than 3,300 persons that donot meet the no-action levels simply would be required to apply to theState for a treatment plan. States would determine what type of corrosioncontrol treatment would result in the minimization of lead levels at thetap and specify this treatment in the plan. (Systems that preferred todevelop and submit their own treatment plan would be allowed to do so.)The treatment plan would contain the same performance standard as thatrequired from larger systems_installation of corrosion control treatmentto either meet the no-action levels or minimize the corrosivity of tapwater towards lead, and an effective program of public education if oneor both of the no-action levels are exceeded after treatment. The activitiesrequired of small systems to meet this performance standard would be tailoredto their ability to perform detailed analyses of alternative corrosioncontrol treatments and to conduct public education programs. For example,rather than conducting pipe loop, laboratory, pilot-scale, or field studiesto determine optimal treatment, the State would specify the type of treatmentsmall systems are to install. The State would be responsible for determiningwhat treatment is most likely to be effective in each system. Once thetreatment is designated, the responsibilities of small systems would bevery similar to those of larger systems. The systems would install andfine-tune the full scale treatment, monitor tap water to assure treatmenteffectiveness, and continue to meet the no-action levels (if achieved bythe specified treatment) or to operate under conditions approved by theState.EPA recognizes that some corrosion treatments may be difficult to implementfor small water suppliers without full-time personnel to monitor and maintainoperations. EPA has therefore identified technologies which may be appropriatefor the smallest water suppliers, i.e., those serving fewer than 500 persons.Soda ash (sodium carbonate) may be appropriate for some of these smallsystems. Other systems may require treatment with lower maintenance requirements;limestone bed contactors (calcite contactors) provide a possible alternative.In a limestone contactor, water is closed to the atmosphere and flows throughand dissolves a packed bed of crushed limestone or another source of calciumcarbonate.  Such devices can reduce lead levels in morning first draw drinkingwater by five-fold and copper by more than 50-fold (EPA, 1987d). Thesedevices need relatively low maintenance (although they require occasionalbackwashing), are effective and relatively low in cost, and provide a viabletreatment alternative for many small systems. However, there are a fewlimitations associated with calcite contactors. First, this technologymay not be effective for systems with source water that is already saturatedwith CaCO<T2>3</T2>. Second, systems that do use this treatment technology may notmeet the no-action level for pH, especially if the source water has lowpH and low total alkalinity. This treatment technology may need to be coupledwith another treatment technology to achieve the no-action levels for bothpH and lead. Dolomite contactors may provide treatment similar to thatof calcite contactors. While water suppliers may use any treatment to minimizewater corrosivity, EPA believes the treatment methods described above maybe more practical for the smallest systems, and encourages States to considerthem seriously in developing treatment plans for these PWSs.The treatment plan for systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons would includea schedule for installing and adjusting the treatment designated by theState, and would include the following specific steps, which correspondto Steps (3)-(5) for larger systems (described above):<T3>Step 1:</T3> Installation and operation of the corrosion control treatmentrequired by the State in the water system as a whole, within three yearsof issuance of the treatment plan.<T3>Step 2: </T3>Monitoring to determine the efficacy of the treatmentas installed.<T3>Step 3: </T3>Adjustment of the installed treatment as necessary toensure that lead levels are minimized.<T3>Step 4: </T3>If one or more no-action levels are still exceeded afterinstallation and adjustment of treatment by the system, the State wouldanalyze all treatment and resulting lead levels to determine whether treatmentis optimal, i.e., lead levels are minimized, for the specific system. Monitoringdata supporting the conclusion that treatment is optimal must be submittedto the State.Suppliers serving fewer than 3,300 persons that wish to change other concurrenttreatments that might reduce the effectiveness of the approved corrosioncontrol treatment, or experience significant change in the population servedor in the extent of the distribution system, would be required to notifythe State of the proposed changes. States may disapprove the changes andrequire modifications necessary to preserve the minimal corrosivity ofthe water.b. <T3>Public Education. </T3>Under this proposal, those water suppliers (ofall sizes) exceeding one or both of the no-action levels for lead (eitherthe average or the maximum) would be required to conduct a public educationprogram to reduce exposure to lead. The public education program wouldbe a part of the treatment plan. Public education would begin as soon asthe State approves or issues the treatment plan which includes public educationprogram. States could approve or issue a treatment plan in two steps toallow the public education programs to begin as quickly as possible. Inthese cases, the State would approve the part of the treatment plan thatcontains the public education program first, without waiting for finalanalysis and approval of the corrosion control portion. Two-part approvalwould be especially useful when the corrosion control laboratory work andscale-up analysis is complicated.The proposed public education program differs both from the general publicnotification requirements and the special lead public notification requirementsunder sections 1414 and 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (see 52 FR41534, October 28, 1987). First, the public education program would bean ongoing requirement of the NPDWR for lead and copper, for as long asone or both no-action level is exceeded, as opposed to the special leadnotification requirement, which is basically a one-time notice. Second,the public education program under this proposal would be required to includeintensive interaction between the PWS and its customers to educate themabout lead in drinking water, whereas the general public notification programis passive; it simply notifies customers of violations. As explained inSection III. above, excess levels of lead in drinking water supplies canpose a risk to public health. A well designed and executed public educationprogram can induce public water system customers to voluntarily modifytheir water use behavior, mitigating risks that may result from lead leachinginto drinking water.Water suppliers would be required to design public education programs tomeet three performance standards, one regarding program content, a secondregarding program delivery, and a third regarding program evaluation, asdescribed below.i. <T3>Program Content.</T3> The public education program would include informationon health reasons for concern about lead exposure, including, in qualitativeand quantitative terms, information on specific potential health effectsassociated with excess blood lead levels and the possible contributionof drinking water to them. As described in detail earlier, these effectsinclude interference with heme synthesis, anemia, kidney damage, impairedreproductive function and fetal effects, interference with vitamin D metabolism,impaired cognitive performance (as measured by IQ tests, performance inschool, and other means), delayed physical and neurological development,and elevations in blood pressure (EPA, 1986b). Also, the consumer wouldbe advised that the risks associated with lead in drinking water may beaggravated by exposure to lead from other sources. Other sources includelead from paint chips or paint dust, occupational and home hobby exposures(e.g., smelting, electronics), inhalation of airborne lead, and ingestionof lead in food, especially lead that leaches into food from lead-solderedcontainers.Besides identifying the nature of the problem associated with lead in drinkingwater, the public education program would be required to provide informationthat the consumer may use to evaluate the probability of excess levelsof lead in his or her own household water supply. This information mustinclude the potential for excess lead levels in the water as the waterleaves the water supplier and the potential for further increases in thelead levels as a result of corrosion of water supply system components.In addition, the public education program must advise consumers to examinethe service line, pipes, and soldered joints in their homes for lead, andfaucets and other fixtures for brass, which may commonly contain lead;how to have their water analyzed by a commercial laboratory to determinethe lead content; and to contact the PWS for additional information. Theprogram must also include specific information on the banning of materialscontaining lead for use in drinking water systems. The PWS should be preparedto respond to public inquiries on any issues related to lead in drinkingwater. EPA solicits comment on additional information that the public educationprogram should include.The public education program would be required to advise consumers of theactions that may be taken to immediately reduce exposure to lead levelsin drinking water that exceed the maximum no-action level, i.e., 0.020mg/l. These actions include: Non-wasteful flushing of taps (such as dishwashing)before any water from a tap is consumed or used for any type of cookingor other food preparation including preparation of baby formula; usingonly cold water for drinking or the preparation of any food or formula;possibly replacing portion of the service line owned by the consumer orlandlord if it is made of lead and is contributing significant amountsof lead to the drinking water; ensuring that all plumbing repair work isperformed using lead-free solder (explaining that the use of lead solderin drinking water systems is illegal); and providing an electrical groundfor household wiring other than the household plumbing system if permittedby local building and electrical codes. The Agency invites comments onthe effectiveness of these or any other actions that may be used to effectan immediate reduction in exposure to drinking water lead.The public education program would require the identification of any actionsalready taken by any official parties within the community to evaluate,quantify, and/or reduce the levels of lead in drinking water and must publicizethe results of compliance and other monitoring for lead (including resultsof any monitoring arranged by the PWS at the request of a consumer, asdescribed below).ii. <T3>Program Delivery.</T3> The delivery of the public education programis defined by three factors: The audience, the media used to deliver theprogram, and the frequency and duration with which the program is delivered.EPA believes that often it would be appropriate to target the educationprogram to specific segments of the public. For instance, residences withknown high lead levels, lead service lines, or lead solder less than fiveyears old would be targeted. However, if many or nearly all of the residencesare at high risk, then the program should be conducted community-wide.The Agency expects many systems already have much information regardingplumbing materials in the distribution system and in homes. Under 40 CFR141.42(d) systems were required to identify whether lead from pipe, solder,caulking, interior lining of distribution mains, alloys and home plumbingwas present, and report the results to the States by 1983. Systems arestrongly encouraged to use the results of this identification to assistin the estimation of the prevalence of high risk houses and to assist thetargeting of public education programs to those areas of the communitymost likely to have a large proportion of residences with high lead levelsin their water.Public water systems also would be required to consider whether it is appropriateto target customers on the basis of traits other than geographic locationand household plumbing type. For instance, available data indicate thatchildren and developing fetuses are more susceptible to the effects oflead in drinking water than adults are. Therefore, public water systemscould target programs to customers that are associated with children andpregnant women. These customers include families, child day care providers,schools, and hospitals. Systems could also target customers with othertraits or characteristics that are known to correlate with sensitivityto elevated levels of lead in drinking water supplies such as persons havingoccupational or other high enviromental exposure, e.g., people workingin or living near lead smelters. In addition, bilingual information wouldbe required to be disseminated to non-English speaking portions of thetargeted population.As a part of the public education program, EPA is proposing to requirethat water suppliers offer a program of extended monitoring, beyond thecompliance monitoring requirements. The goal of the extended monitoringis to allow all customers to easily determine lead levels and sources intheir own household water, especially in cases where the household wasnot among the residences chosen for compliance monitoring. EPA expectsthis provision to increase substantially the effectiveness of the publiceducation program in reducing exposure to lead in drinking water.Under the extended monitoring requirement, water suppliers would be requiredto offer all customers the opportunity to have household water tested forlead. The public water supplier would not be required to provide this servicefor free, but would be allowed to pass the costs of gathering and analyzingthe samples on to the customers who elected to participate in the program.The supplier itself could gather, analyze, and report the results to thecustomer, or the supplier could make arrangements with any certified laboratoryto provide the analyses to the customer. In this way, customers would gaineasy access to quality water sampling services, and not be subjected torepeated trial-and-error in finding reasonably priced, qualified samplingservices. At the same time, the public water supplier could minimize itsburden in providing the sampling services by making arrangements with anoutside laboratory.EPA strongly recommends that water suppliers assist customers in identifyingthe sources of high water lead levels when they are found. The suppliercould advise customers to collect samples representative of water thathas stood in the service line overnight and a fully flushed sample fromthe tap. Comparison of the service line sample with the fully flushed samplewould allow the customer to identify the source of elevated water leadlevels and to take appropriate steps to effectively limit further exposure.For example, if the service line sample shows elevated lead levels, a leadservice line may be present. The customer would then be able to determinethe value of service line replacement as a means of reducing exposure.If the alternative of having the public water supply remove lead servicelines that it owns and/or controls and offer to remove the remainder forthe customer at cost (as discussed below) is adopted, these additionalsamples would enable suppliers to determine which service lines must bereplaced. If the fully flushed sample shows elevated lead levels, thiswould indicate that the lead is entering the house from the water supplyeither in the distributed water leaving the plant or as a result of corrosionof pipes owned or under the control of the water supplier. If only themorning first draw sample showed elevated lead levels, the customer couldbe fairly confident that the lead was originating within his/her residence.EPA believes that the appropriate medium for public education and schedulefor delivery of a public education program are largely a function of thetarget population. Thus, under this proposal, systems would be requiredto tailor the form of delivery of the public education program to the natureand size of the target population. For instance, if the target is all residentsof a large city, a radio or television Public Service Announcement (PSA)would be appropriate. Conversely, if the target is all residents of a singleneighborhood or small town, a public meeting in the neighborhood schoolwould be appropriate. Some other possible methods for public educationinclude preparation of pamphlets or brochures for mass distribution andsetting up local telephone hotlines (if used in conjunction with othereducation methods). The severity of the high lead levels is another factorsystems should consider in determining the appropriate medium of educationand intensity of the program.Non-transient non-community water systems serve different populations thancommunity water systems, and thus have different public education requirements.Instead of the requirements described above, NTNC water systems would berequired to take the following actions for the duration of the period duringwhich public education is required: (1) Publicly post informational postersin a prominent place; (2) hold at least one public meeting annually toeducate water consumers about lead in drinking water and to answer questionsabout the subject; and (3) distribute brief informational pamphlets onlead in drinking water at least quarterly.Public water systems serving more than 3,300 persons would be requiredto submit the proposed content of the public education program, as wellas the manner in which the system would implement it, to the State forreview and approval before implementation as a part of the treatment plan.In order to speed implementation of public education, States could approvethe part of the treatment plan which covers public education before approvingthe rest of the treatment plan.As with public notification requirements, public education programs arethe responsibility of the water supplier. However, recognizing that notall systems would have the expertise to conduct such a program in an effectivemanner, EPA encourages systems to develop joint agreements with State orlocal public health agencies which have experience in presenting informationon health hazards to the public. EPA also encourages systems to coordinatetheir activities with other local or State programs designed to reduceexposure to lead. For example, local childhood lead screening programsmay include complementary public education activities.Under this proposal, a public education program would include a seriesof events. For example, a single effort could include several public meetings,a series of PSAs, and a mailing of pamphlets. This series of events couldoccur over a period of time (e.g., several weeks). The public educationprogram, consisting of each of its individual events, would be requiredto occur at the rate of four times per year for as long as the system isrequired to conduct a public education program (i.e., as long as one ofthe two lead no-action levels is exceeded). For example, a note could beplaced on each water bill that says ``Are you aware of the possible effectsof lead in your drinking water? You should be. Contact <T2>XXXX</T2> for more information.''iii. <T3>Program Evaluation. </T3>Under this proposal, a water system whichserves more than 10,000 customers and conducts a public education programwould be required to evaluate the program, within 12 months after the programis undertaken, to determine the extent to which it has been effective.The system must show that consumers have knowledge about lead in drinkingwater. The evaluation would consist of a survey of customers to determinewhether they had acquired useful information that enabled them to reducetheir exposures to lead in drinking water. Based on this evaluation, thesystem would determine if and how the program would be modified to increasethe program's effectiveness if modification is determined by the Stateto be necessary to ensure the program's continued effectiveness.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Alternatives to the Proposed Treatment Technique</ITAG>The SDWA requires EPA to set NPDWRs as close to the MCLG as is feasible.EPA believes the proposed rule meets this standard and also is protectiveof public health. However, EPA is considering several alternatives in additionto the proposed rule. They are discussed in detail below. EPA may decideto promulgate a rule which incorporates any one or more of these alternatives.For example, EPA may retain the average lead no-action level and eliminatethe pH no-action level, and delete the MCL for lead in distributed water.Alternatively, EPA may modify the proposal by having the maximum lead no-actionlevel trigger treatment, requiring replacement of those lead service connectionswhich contribute significant amounts of lead to tap water, and/or adoptan alternative approach to monitoring. Accordingly, the Agency especiallyrequests comments on each of these alternative approaches and combinationsof alternatives.a. <T3>Use of Maximum Lead No-Action Level to Trigger Treatment. </T3>EPAis considering an alternative to the proposal which would likely resultin lead levels in water somewhat closer to the proposed goal of zero. Thisalternative is similar to the proposal except that corrosion control treatmentin addition to public education would be triggered if the lead level inmore than 5 percent of the samples exceeded 0.020 mg/l. Systems that didnot meet this additional no-action level would be required to reduce thecorrosivity of water until it no longer exceeded this level or demonstratedto the State that it had minimized the corrosivity of its water, in additionto conducting public education. (Under the proposed rule, systems failingto comply with the no-action level of 0.020 mg/l or less in 95 percentor more of samples would be subject to the public education requirementonly.)EPA expects that some systems that meet the average lead no-action levelwould not be able to meet the maximum. Thus, more water suppliers wouldbe required to install or improve corrosion control treatment, and to demonstrateto the States that the treatment they had installed resulted in compliancewith the no-action levels or was optimal. Two groups of water supplierswould be affected in this way. Some water suppliers that would meet theproposed no-action level average of 0.010 mg/l without any treatment oradditional treatment (beyond that already in place) may fail to meet the``maximum'' of 0.020 mg/l. In addition, water suppliers that would alreadybe required under the proposal to improve water treatment to meet the averageof 0.010 mg/l might have to improve their treatment more if they must tryto meet both the average and the ``maximum'' of 0.020 mg/l. If they couldnot meet both levels, they would be required to demonstrate that the wateris minimally corrosive. EPA is unable to precisely estimate the increasednumber of water suppliers that would be affected but it is likely to beseveral thousand.Since more systems would be treating their water to make it less corrosivethan under the proposed rule, more people would consume water with lesslead than under the proposals (although precise estimates of these reductionsare not available). EPA seeks comment on this alternative because thisalternative would result in water lead levels closer to the MCLG of zero,thus reducing consumers' exposure to lead more than the approach proposedtoday. This reduced exposure would result in some additional health benefitswith potential theoretical benefits under this alternative that could besubstantial. However, EPA is concerned that many more water suppliers mayhave to demonstrate to the State that they have optimized corrosion controlor that new or improved treatment results in meeting the no-action levels.It is unclear whether the States would be able to sustain a time-consumingand technical interaction with an increased number of facilities over severalyears while at the same time assuring effective implementation of the otherdrinking water regulations. Therefore actual benefits may be less thanthe theoretical benefits and may not be substantially different than theproposed alternative. Because of this concern, EPA is also consideringtwo variations to this alternative which may reduce the magnitude of thisimplementation problem. The first is raising the maximum no-action levelto trigger corrosion control treatment to 0.030 mg/l to better assure thatthis alternative could be implemented while still providing additionalhealth benefits by limiting high lead exposures. The second variation wouldsubstitute the no-action level of 0.020 mg/l or less lead in 95 percentor more sample in place of the two no-action levels in the proposal (averagelevel of 0.010 mg/l for lead and pH andgreater;8 in 95 percent or more samples)and have only one no-action level to trigger both corrosion control treatmentand public education. EPA requests comment on all of these alternatives.b. <T3>Use of Total Alkalinity No-Action Level to Trigger Treatment. </T3>EPAis considering an alternative to the proposal which would likely resultin lead levels in water somewhat closer to the proposed goal of zero. Thisalternative is similar to the proposal except that corrosion control treatmentwould be triggered if the total alkalinity in 95 percent or more sampleswas not 30 mg/l or higher. Systems would be required to reduce the corrosivityof water until it exceeded this level or demonstrated to the State thatit had minimized the corrosivity.EPA expects that some systems that meet the average lead no-action leveland the no-action pH level would not be able to meet the total alkalinityno-action level. Thus, more water suppliers would be required to installor improve corrosion control treatment, and to demonstrate to the Statesthat the treatment they had installed resulted in compliance with the no-actionlevels or was optimal. Two groups of water suppliers would be affectedin this way. Some water suppliers that would meet the proposed no-actionlevel average of 0.010 mg/l lead and the no-action level for pH withoutany new or additional treatment (beyond that already in place) may failto meet the total alkalinity no-action level of 30 mg/l. In addition, watersuppliers that would already be required under the proposal to improvewater treatment to meet the average of 0.010 mg/l and/or the pH andgreater;8might have to improve their treatment more than necessary to meet the averageand the pH only to try to meet the total alkalinity of 30 mg/l. If theycould not meet all three levels, they would be required to demonstratethat the water is minimally corrosive. EPA is unable to precisely estimatethe increased number of water suppliers that would be affected but it maybe about a thousand.Since more systems would be treating their water to make it less corrosivethan under the proposal, more people would consume water with less leadthan under the proposal (although precise estimates of these reductionsare not available). This alternative would result in water lead levelscloser to the MCLG of zero, thus reducing consumers' exposure to lead morethan the approach proposed today. EPA seeks comment on this alternativebecause this reduced exposure would result in some additional health benefitswith potential theoretical benefits under this alternative that could besubstantial. Actual benefits may be less than the theoretical benefitsand may not be substantially different than the proposed alternative. However,EPA is concerned that more water suppliers may have to demonstrate to theState that they have optimized corrosion control. If average lead levelsare equal to or below 0.010 mg/l, but the alkalinity fails to meet thespecified level, additional treatment may not substantially reduce leadlevels further. Therefore, including alkalinity may cause some systemsto incur additional costs unnecessarily. EPA solicits comment on this alternative.c. <T3>Eliminating the pH No-Action Level. </T3>The proposed regulation wouldrequire that water suppliers adjust the pH of their water to 8 or above,unless they demonstrate that corrosion is minimized at lower pH levels,as part of the corrosion control treatment technique. EPA believes thisparameter represents the outer bound of water that is minimally corrosiveto lead. However, concern with using pH as a fixed regulatory requirementhas been raised. If average lead levels are equal to or below 0.010 mg/l,but the pH fails to meet the specified level, additional treatment maynot substantially reduce lead levels further. Therefore, including pH maycause some systems to incur additional cost unnecessarily.Because of this concern, EPA solicits public comment on an alternativein which the pH value is not a regulatory no-action level but only guidance.Under this alternative, determination of compliance with the treatmenttechnique requirement would be based solely on the lead and copper levelsfound in the sampled residences. The MCL of 0.005 mg/l for lead in waterleaving the treatment plant would still apply, as would the MCL of 1.3mg/l for copper. If samples exceed the average of 0.010 mg/l, the PWS wouldbe required to install corrosion control treatment and conduct a publiceducation program as in the proposed rule. Those systems that continueto exceed the 0.020 mg/l lead no-action level in more than five percentof targeted samples must also conduct public education. Once lead was reducedto below the 0.010 mg/l average, or the water supplier demonstrated thatoptimal corrosion control treatment was being applied, the water supplierwould be in compliance with the treatment technique requirement.Under this alternative, suppliers would not be required to measure pH aspart of compliance monitoring. However, systems that did not meet the no-actionaverage level for lead would be required to monitor pH and examine theeffects of increasing pH above 8 as part of the optimization demonstration.This alternative could result in less public health protection becausefewer systems may be required to install corrosion control treatment. ThepH requirement, in conjunction with the lead average no-action level, wouldtrigger treatment in more systems than would the lead average alone. Inaddition fewer small systems may be required to install treatment underthis alternative because these systems are required to take fewer leadand copper samples. Because of the reduced monitoring, more of these systemsare likely to have undetected lead levels above the no-action level andthus would not be required to install or improve treatment; the pH no-actionlevel ``catches'' some of these systems and requires them to control corrosion.Thus final lead levels may not be as close to the proposed MCLG of zeroas under the proposed approach.Note that the actual reduction in benefit in this alternative may be somewhatsmaller than the theoretical reduction because it is easier to administer.Therefore, the actual benefits may not be substantially different thanthe proposed approach.Theoretically, one way to overcome this problem with this alternative wouldbe for EPA to increase the number of lead samples required by PWSs, especiallysmall systems. However, EPA is concerned that small systems may be unableto take the additional number of samples necessary to assure protectionof public health. EPA is especially interested in comment on the trade-offbetween the proposal and improving this alternative by increasing the numberof samples required.d. <T3>Lead Service Line Replacement Program. </T3>EPA considered requiringreplacement of lead service lines and connections in cases where they contributemeasurable amounts of lead to the tap water, but is not now proposing thisprogram. EPA particularly solicits public comment both on the specificalternative described below including the materials evaluation and monitoringrequirements, as well as any alternatives that might better achieve EPA'sgoals in a better and less burdensome way.The program EPA is considering would require the replacement of lead servicelines and connections that, after implementation of any corrosion controltreatment, continue to contribute measurable amounts of lead to drinkingwater (0.003 mg/l or more), and that are under the ownership or controlof the PWS. This alternative would have three components: (1) A full materialsevaluation (i.e., identification of all buildings served by lead servicelines or connections), (2) monitoring at all buildings with lead servicelines or connections, and (3) the replacement of lead service lines andconnections under the ownership or control of the system that are foundto contribute 0.003 mg/l or more to lead levels at the tap. Obviously,no such program would be required in communities in which no lead servicelines or connections have been used.The program considered by EPA would require replacing only those pipesthat contribute measurable amounts to lead levels at the tap. Communitiesthat have residences with lead service lines in their targeted sample set(as described in Section V.C.2.) would be candidates for the lead serviceline replacement program. If the service line sample of any house in thetargeted monitoring set exceeded 0.020 mg/l, the system would be requriedto identify and take service line samples from a number of residences equalto the number of required samples for compliance monitoring. If five percentor more of the total service line samples from this expanded sample exceeded0.020 mg/l, the service line replacement program would be triggered forthat system.Once the service line replacement program was triggered, the system wouldbe required to take the three steps listed above: inventory all lead servicelines and connections in the community, test each of them, and replaceall portions of those connections owned or controlled by the system contributingmeasurable amounts of lead to the drinking water.Under this program, EPA would establish two rebuttable presumptions. Thefirst rebuttable presumption would be that lead service lines and connectionscontribute to lead levels at the tap. The water supplier would first berequired to conduct a full inventory of the materials used in the watersystem and to locate all lead service lines, goosenecks, pigtails, andother lead materials. A materials evaluation should already have been conductedunder the requirements of the 1980 amendments to the National Interim PrimaryDrinking Water Regulations (45 FR 57332, August 27, 1980, 40 CFR 141.42(d)).If not previously done, suppliers would be required to conduct a completematerials evaluation. To rebut the presumption and avoid replacing thelead service lines and other connections, the PWS would be required tomonitor each home in the community with a lead service connection or pipeto determine whether the lead service contributes measureable amounts oflead to lead levels at the tap. Specifically, the PWS would have to takea service connection sample and fully flushed sample and demonstrate thatthe service connection sample has lead levels that are no more than thefully flushed sample from the same tap. This presumption must be rebuttedfor each lead connection the system wishes to avoid replacing. The second presumption is that the water supplier owns or controls andtherefore can replace, the lead components up to the wall of the buildingserved. In this case, the PWS would be required to replace the entire lengthof each lead service connection contributing measurable lead to water,from the water main to the building wall, including lead goosenecks, pigtails,and any other lead connections. This presumption could be rebutted by thewater supplier by citing local ordinances or State statutes, or in thecase or private suppliers, the contract between the system and their customers,that might limit the extent of the PWS' control. Water supplies that rebutthe second presumption would have to replace only the portion of each serviceline and those connections under their ownership or control that contributea measurable amount of lead to the water. Lead service connections would be required to be replaced on a fixed scheduleas part of the system's treatment plan. No water supplier would be allowedlonger than 15 years (starting when the service connection replacementprogram is triggered unless the system is granted an exemption under Section1416 of the Act) to replace all lead service connections that require replacement.Water suppliers would be required to replace, or test and rebut the presumptions,for a number of lead services equal in number to at least five percentof the total service connections in the community each year until all thoserequiring it are replaced. EPA would set the 15-year time limit becausethis schedule accelerates replacement over current practice. e. <T3>No MCL for Distributed Water. </T3>Instead of the proposed two-partapproach consisting of MCLs for lead and copper in distributed water anda treatment technique for lead and copper as corrosion by-products, EPAconsidered an alternative which would establish only a treatment techniquefor those contaminants which can enter water from source water and as aby-product of corrosion. The alternative would resemble the proposed approachexcept there would be no MCL for lead and copper in distributed water.Under this alternative, systems meeting the no-action level average of0.010 mg/l and having 0.020 mg/l or less lead in 95 percent of targetedsamples, and having 1.3 mg/l or less copper in 95 percent of targeted sampleswould be in compliance with the treatment technique requirement. A system not initially meeting the lead average or copper no-action levelswould be allowed to employ whatever combination of corrosion control andsource water treatments the system chooses to meet the no-action level.Systems still failing to meet the no-action levels by the specified date(either due to source water or corrosion problems) would be required toobtain a State-approved treatment plan. The treatment plan would containtwo elements: (1) Steps to reduce lead levels to below the no-action levelsor to demonstrate that source water controls and corrosion control treatmentare optimal if the no-action average lead level of 0.010 mg/l were notmet, and (2) a public education program if the lead average were not metor if five percent of lead samples exceeded 0.020 mg/l. Under this alternative,systems would generally be required to take the following steps to reducethe lead levels in water: (1) Conduct a study to determine the amount of lead in morning first drawsamples that originates in the source water and the amount originatingas a corrosion by-product, in the residences monitored for compliance (monitoringwould be conducted in targeted residences, as in the proposed rule). (2) If lead in source water was found to be above 0.010 mg/l, the systemwould be required to install lead removal technology including any of thosethat would remove lead from source water to below 0.010 mg/l is describedas BAT in Section IV.C. above. (3) If lead as a corrosion by-product was found to be above 0.010 mg/las an average, the system would be required to install corrosion controltreatment, as described in Section IV.D.1. above. (4) If neither source water lead nor corrosion by-product lead were individuallyabove 0.010 mg/l (either naturally or because of treatment installed in(2) or (3) above), but the combination of them was above 0.010 mg/l, thesystem would be required to install either lead removal treatment as describedin (2) above, or corrosion control treatment as described in (3) above,or both. The precise combination chosen would be up to the system, as longas the levels in targeted samples were reduced to 0.010 mg/l or lower asa average. If, after installation of treatment, average lead levels intargeted samples remain above 0.010 mg/l, systems would be required toinstall any additional treatment required by the State (either lead removalor corrosion control treatment), or if none existed, demonstrate to theState that treatment (especially corrosion control treatment) already installedwas being operated in a manner that minimized lead levels.(5) If, after installation of all the treatment described in (2)-(4) above,morning first draw lead levels remained above an average of 0.010 mg/lor if lead levels are 0.020 mg/l or less in 95 percent of targeted samples,the system would be required to conduct a public education program.A potential advantage offered by this alternative is that it offers a PWSthe opportunity to determine for themselves and implement the most efficientcombination of treatments to minimize lead levels at the tap. A disadvantageof this option is that it would allow systems to distribute water at levelsbetween 0.005 and 0.010 mg/l in cases where lower levels are possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Monitoring</ITAG><T3>A. Analytic Methods</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>NPDWRs must include ``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinkingwater which dependably complies with such maximum contaminant levels, includingquality control and testing procedures to insure compliance with such levelsand to insure proper operation and maintenance of the system * * * .''Section 1401(1)(D).EPA evaluated the analytic methods for lead, copper, and pH with respectto the accuracy of recovery (lack of bias) and precision (good reproducibility)in the range of the MCLs and no-action levels being considered. The primarypurpose of this evaluation was to determine:andbullet; Whether analytic methods are technically available to measurethese contaminants in drinking water;andbullet; What are reasonable expectations of technical performance by analyticlaboratories at the proposed MCL and no-action levels; and andbullet; The costs of analysis for these contaminants.The selection of appropriate analytic methods for compliance with theseregulations includes consideration of the following factors:andbullet; Reliability (i.e., precision/accuracy) of the analytical results;andbullet; Specificity in the presence of interferences;andbullet; Availability of sufficient equipment and trained personnel toimplement a national monitoring program;andbullet; Rapidity of analysis to permit routine use; andandbullet; Cost of analysis to water supply systems. 2. Specific Analytic Methods There are analytic methods available and approved by EPA for the determinationof lead in drinking water, as listed in Table 10. There is no currentlyapproved method for copper because there is currently no primary MCL forit. The analytic methods listed in this table have been used for many yearsto meet the compliance monitoring requirements specified in the interimNPDWR for lead. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 10._<T4>Currently Approved Methods for Analyzing Lead Under the Interim Regulations</T4><H1>Methodology </H1><H1>Reference (Method Number) </H1><H2>EPA \1\ </H2><H2>ASTM \2\ </H2><H2>SM \3\ </H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Atomic absorption; furnace technique<D>239.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atomic absorption; direct aspiration<D>239.1</D><D>D3559-78A or B</D><D>301A-II or III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inductively coupled plasma<D>\4\ 200.7A</D><F>\1\ ``Methods of Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,'' EPA EnvironmentalMonitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH (EPA-600/4-79-020), March1979.

The costs associated with the analysis of these metalsare within the economic means of water supply systems. The cost for analyzinglead and copper is estimated at about $6 to $30 per metal per sample. (Theactual analytical costs may vary with the laboratory, analytical techniqueselected, the total number of samples, and other factors.) Also, the numberof laboratories that routinely participate in EPA's Water Supply and WaterPollution performance evaluation studies indicates that there are manylaboratories available that have the capability to analyze for lead andcopper in drinking water using these methods.Below is a description of each of the techniques EPA is proposing to approvefor analysis of lead and copper in drinking water. EPA requests publiccomment on the technical adequacy as well as the economic feasibility ofthe proposed analytic techniques.a. <T3>Atomic Absorption Methods. </T3>Levels of lead and copper in solutionmay be determined by atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy. There are twotechniques that may be used: Direct aspiration and the furnace technique.EPA is proposing to allow use of the direct aspiration technique only toanalyze for copper because this method cannot analyze the low levels oflead specified in this proposal. In direct aspiration, the sample is aspiratedinto a flame and atomized. A light beam is directed through the flame intoa monochromator and onto a detector that measures the amount of light absorbedby the atomized element in the flame. Because each metal has its own characteristicabsorption wavelength, a source lamp composed of that element is used whichmakes the method relatively free from spectral or radiation interferences.The amount of energy of the characteristic wavelength absorbed in the flamefrom the metal being analyzed is proportional to the concentration of theelement in the sample. In the furnace technique, a sample is placed ina graphite tube in a furnace, evaporated to dryness, charred, and atomized.Because the percentage of available analyte atoms vaporized and dissociatedfor absorption in the graphite tube is greater using this method than thepercentage of available analyte atomized in the flame of the direct aspirationAA method, the furnace technique can detect lower concentrations.Low-level analyses of lead in drinking water using atomic absorption methodsmust be performed with uncontaminated glassware. Retained lead is mostlikely to occur on the ground glass surface of volumetric glassware. EPArecommends that laboratories avoid the problem of contamination by usinga separate set of glassware for low-level lead analyses. Also, particularattention should be given to glassware cleaning by ensuring that all groundglass surfaces are soaked and held in contact with cleaning acid for aminimum of two hours.b. <T3>Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)_Atomic Emission SpectrophotometricMethod. </T3>This method (also known as ``EPA Method 200.7'') describesa technique for the simultaneous or sequential multi-element determinationof trace elements in solution. This method is applicable to the measurementof copper only; it is not yet sensitive enough to measure lead for purposesof this regulation. (Further improvement in the method may make it appropriatefor measurement of lead at a later date. If so, EPA would then considerapproving this method for measuring lead.) The basis of the method is themeasurement of atomic emission by an optical spectroscopic technique. Samplesare nebulized and the aerosol that is produced is transported to the plasmatorch where excitation occurs. Characteristic line emission spectra areproduced by a radio frequency inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The spectraare dispersed by a grating spectrometer and the intensities of the linesare monitored by photomultiplier tubes. The photocurrents from the photomultiplierare processed and controlled by a computer system. A background correctiontechnique is required to compensate for variable background contributionsto the determination of trace elements. Background levels must be measuredadjacent to analyte lines on samples during analysis.The appendix to EPA Method 200.7, entitled ``Inductively Coupled Plasma_AtomicEmission Analysis of Drinking Water,'' describes a technique for concentratingthe sample prior to analysis. Under this proposal, systems would be requiredto follow this concentration technique in processing drinking water supplysamples prior to ICP emission spectrometric analysis for copper.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. </ITAG><T3>Method Detection Limits and Practical Quantitation Limits</T3>Generally, EPA defines the method detection limit (MDL) as the minimumconcentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99percent confidence that the true value is greater than zero. The practicalquantitation limit (PQL) is the lowest concentration that can be reliablyachieved by well-operated laboratories within specified limits of precisonand accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. Differencesbetween the MDLs and PQLs are expected; the PQL is generally about 5 to10 times the MDL for relatively clean matrices such as finished drinkingwater. (See EPA 1987e, and 50 FR 46902, November 13, 1985, for a detaileddiscussion of MDLs and PQLs.)The PQL may be determined through interlaboratory studies, such as performanceevaluations (PE) studies. However, if data are not available from interlaboratorystudies, the PQLs may be estimated. In such cases, EPA believes that aPQL set at 10 times the MDL achieved by good laboratories is generallya fair expectation for routine operation of most qualified State and commerciallaboratories. The use of ``five times the MDL'' instead of ``10 times theMDL'' to set the PQL may be appropriate when other considerations suggestthat the PQL should be lower, e.g., see discussion of the PQL for vinylchloride in the final NPDWRs for volatile organic chemicals, July 8, 1987(52 FR 25690).Detection limits have been estimated for the available analytical techniquesfor lead and copper and are summarized in Table 12. Detection limits forlead and copper traditionally have been based on a concentration that correspondsto a specified instrument signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., peak height to background).The detection limits for ICP using the concentration technique (1 andCx.18;g/lfor copper and 0.005 mg/l for lead) were calculated based upon MDLs. TheMDL approach involves the determination of method detection limits usinga procedure defined in Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 136 (analytic methodsfor wastewater pollutants). EPA is using the MDL concept to calculate limitsof detection for analytes in all newly developed methods for determinationof drinking water contaminants.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>12. <T4>Detection Limits for Available Analytical Methods for Copper and Lead</T4><H1>Contaminant </H1><H1>Proposed MCLG (andCx.18;g/l)</H1><H1>Analytic method </H1><H1>Detection limit (andCx.18;g/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>1,300 </D><D>Atomic absorption; furnace </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D>Atomic absorption; direct aspiration </D><D>20</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D>Inductively coupled plasma </D><D>*6(1)</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0 </D><D>Atomic absorption; furnace </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D/>+Atomic absorption; direct aspiration <D>100</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D/>+Inductively coupled plasma <D>*(5)</D><F> *Using the concentration technique in Appendix A to the EPA Method200.7.</F><F> </F>+EPA is not proposing to approve these methods for lead becausethe detection limits are too high to detect low concentrations of leadin drinking water.</ITAG>The PQLs for lead and copper were determined based primarily upon the detectionlimits and the results from PE studies. The PQL for lead was determinedusing EPA and State laboratory data from Water Supply (WS) PE studies andplusmin;12-17.The PQL for copper was determined using EPA and State laboratory data fromWater Pollution (WP) PE studies andplusmin;12-16, since copper is not includedin WS studies. These results are considered to be optimum since they aredrawn from experienced laboratories operating under conditions where theyknew they were being tested, using standard samples in distilled waterand without interferences. Actual day-to-day operations in a wide varietyof laboratories using ``real'' samples of natural tap water would be expectedto produce somewhat poorer results, i.e., have wider performance ranges,especially at the lower concentrations. EPA used the following procedure to determine the PQLs for lead and copperusing the PE study data: 1. Regression equations were generated for precision and accuracy usingthe EPA and State laboratory data for lead and copper. 2. The percent recovery and relative standard deviation were used to estimatethe 95 percent confidence limits. The percent recovery and relative standarddeviation were calculated at the proposed MCLG for copper using the regressionequations generated from the laboratory data for the contaminant. For lead,the percent recovery and relative standard deviation cannot be calculatedat the proposed MCLG because it is zero. Therefore, another concentrationmust be used to calculate the 95 percent confidence limits. This valueis set as close as possible to the proposed MCLG. The lowest MDL for anyof the methods used to detect lead is 0.001 mg/l (for the atomic absorptionfurnace method). The minimum PQL for this method is ``five times the MDL''or 0.005 mg/l using the ``five to 10 times the MDL'' criterion. This valuewas selected as the appropriate concentration to calculate the 95 percentconfidence limits from the regression equations. The percent recovery,relative standard deviation, and the 95 percent confidence limits for leadand copper are summarized in Table 13. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>13._95 <T4>Percent Confidence Limits for Detection of Lead and Copper</T4><H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>MCLG (mg/l)</H1><H1>Percent recovery</H1><H1>Relative standard deviation</H1><H1>95 percent confidence limits (percent of true value)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>\1\ 0.005</D><D>107</D><D>21</D><D>65-149</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>1.3</D><D>99</D><D>4</D><D>91-107</D><F>\1\ The calculations are made assuming that 0.005 mg/l is the lowestpossible PQL instead of zero.

These PQLs aresummarized in Table 14.  Public comments are requested on the PQLs for lead and copper.  <ITAG tagnum="81">4. pH_Electrometric Method  </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve the electrometric method for measuring thepH of drinking water samples collected to determine compliance with thisproposed rule. The references for this method appear in Table 15 below.Under this method, the pH of a sample is determined electrometrically usingeither a glass electrode in combination with a reference potential, orusing a combination electrode. The pH meter must provide accurate and reproducibleresults within andplusmin;1 pH unit and should be equipped with a temperaturecompensation unit. The pH meter may need to be adjusted to compensate forwater temperature.

Total Alkalinity_Titrimetric Method</ITAG>Under the titrimetric method, total alkalinity is measured by titrationto an electrochemically determined end point pH of 4.5. The sample mustnot be filtered, diluted, concentrated, or altered in any way. The samplewould be required to be refrigerated to 40anddegrees;C and run as soon aspractical. The sample bottle should be air tight and should not be openedbefore analysis. The pH measured at the tap must be provided with thissample so that an accurate alkalinity measurement can be made.Under this procedure, the alkalinity is calculated using the followingformula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,20,2,15</C> <H1>Alkalinity, mg CaCO</H1><T2>3</T2>/l<H1>=</H1><H1>Aandmultiply;Nandmultiply;50,000</H1><H2>ml sample</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A = ml standard acid used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">N = normality of standard acid.</ITAG>For low alkalinities, the titration is stopped at a pH in the range of4.3 to 4.7.

The sample is next titrated to a pH exactly 0.3 pH unitslower and the volume of titrant required to reach this end point is recorded.(Method 403, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,16th edition, 1985).For low alkalinities, total alkalinity is calculated by the following formula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,20,2,20</C> <H1>Total alkalinity, mg CaCO</H1><T2>3</T2>/l<H1>=</H1><H1>(2B^C)andmultiply;Nandmultiply;50,000</H1><H2>ml sample</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B = ml titrant to first recorded pH.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C = total ml titrant to reach pH 0.3 units lower.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">N = normality of standard acid.</ITAG>B. Laboratory ApprovalEPA recognizes that the effectiveness of the proposed regulations dependsupon the ability of analytical laboratories to measure lead and copperreliably at relatively low levels. pH measurements must be reliable aswell. EPA's regulations specify that only approved laboratories can analyzecompliance samples (40 CFR 141.28).EPA's existing drinking water Laboratory Certification Program (LCP) hasestablished the use of external checks of performance to evaluate the abilityof laboratories to analyze samples for specific contaminants and to producedata within specific limits. For this purpose, EPA provides performanceevaluation (PE) samples to laboratories on a regular basis; participationin this program is a prerequisite for a laboratory to achieve certificationand to remain certified for analyzing compliance samples. Achieving acceptableperformance in these studies of known test samples provides some indicationthat the laboratory is following proper practices. Unacceptable performancemay be indicative of problems that could affect the reliability of thecompliance data generated for specific contaminants.Unacceptable performance by any laboratory may trigger an investigationto establish the possible cause(s) and to take corrective action. EPA recognizesthat even a superior analytical laboratory occasionally produces data thatare outside the acceptable limits for statistical reasons rather than anyactual analytic problem. A provision for rapid follow-up analysis if alaboratory fails the initial determination is necessary to decrease thelikelihood of statistical error and to determine if a real problem exists.EPA's present PE sample program and the approaches used in the determinationof laboratory performance requirements were discussed at 50 FR 46907 (November13, 1985). Acceptable performance has historically been set by EPA usingtwo different approaches: Regressions from performance of pre-selectedlaboratories or specified accuracy requirements. EPA requested public commenton these approaches in the November 13, 1985 notice. Most commenters onthat notice supported the use of a ``plus or minus percent of the truevalue'' approach to derive acceptance limits instead of generating performancerequirements from study statistics. EPA agrees with these commenters thatthis is the best approach and will specify accuracy requirements in therevised regulations whenever possible.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Laboratory Performance for Lead and Copper</ITAG>EPA has evaluated performance data gathered from past PE studies to setperformance requirements for lead and copper analysis. The available PEdata indicate that both the precision and the accuracy attained for specificinorganic contaminants are contaminant-specific. For example, the percentrecoveries are 99 percent for copper and 107 percent for lead while therelative standard deviations are 4 percent for copper and 21 percent forlead. The ``plus or minus percent of the true value'' acceptance limitshave been derived for each contaminant taking into consideration the expectedprecision and accuracy and using 95 percent confidence limits to estimatethe acceptance limits. For example, the acceptance limits for copper using95 percent confidence limits would be 99 percent andplusmin;2x (4 percent)or 91 to 107 percent of the ``true value.'' Thus, a andplusmin;10 percentof the ``true value'' acceptance limit is approximately equal to the 95percent confidence limits. The acceptance limits would apply to concentrationsequal to or more than the PQL.The acceptance limits are summarized below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s25,xs90</C><H1>Contaminant</H1><H1>Acceptance limits</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D/>andplusmin;10% at andCx.170;0.050 mg/l</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D/>andplusmin;30% at andCx.170;0.005 mg/l</ITAG></ITAG>Public comments are requested on the acceptance limits for lead and copper.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Laboratory Performance for Total Alkalinity</ITAG>The approval criteria for the pH analysis is different from all of theother approval criteria because pH analysis is done in the field. 49 FR43234, Oct. 26, 1984. The pH analyses would be conducted in the targetedhomes with a pH meter. The pH papers would not be permitted for this analyses.The pH meter must meet the specifications listed in the available methods(see Table 15). Under the proposal the pH analyses must be conducted bysamplers who have been certified to use pH meters. This is especially necessarybecause exposure of the sample to air changes sample pH when the samplecontains anions such as carbonate (EPA 1982). However, the analyses conductedon site may be limited by either a lack of certified samplers or a lackof pH meters. EPA requests comment on the pH approval criteria.Therefore, EPA is proposing to allow systems which serve 3,300 personsor less collect the pH sample and send it to a certified laboratory foranalysis. EPA is aware that this exception will often result in a systematicbias of the pH readings to more frequent misses of the no-action levels,and encourages systems to consider carefully the tradeoff between easeof analysis and analytical accuracy (EPA, Method 150.1, Methods for ChemicalAnalysis of Water and Wastes, revised March 1983). EPA requests commenton whether non-field testing of samples should be allowed for systems thatserve fewer than 3,300 persons.EPA is considering and taking comment on a requirement that water systemsmeet a specific alkalinity value in their water in addition to the proposedno-action levels. It is also critical to know the alkalinity of the waterin order to determine the type and extent of appropriate corrosion controltreatment. EPA therefore solicits public comment on the following laboratorycertification requirements that would be necessary if the alkalinity requirementwere adopted in the final rule.Laboratories that meet the approval criteria for metal analyses would alsobe required to meet the performance requirements for total alkalinity analysesbecause, under the proposal, all of these analyses are required for samplestaken from the targeted homes (as explained below), and EPA would requireall analyses for a set of samples to be conducted at the same laboratory.EPA has evaluated performance data gathered from past PE studies to setthe performance requirements for total alkalinity. However, the procedurefor selecting the performance requirements is different than the procedurefor the metal analyses because there is no MDL or PQL for the analysisof total alkalinity. Since laboratories must meet the approval criteriafor total alkalinity in addition to the criteria for the metals, the percentageof laboratories that can achieve this criteria must be higher than thatof the metals so that only a very few laboratories that pass the criteriafor metals are eliminated because of a failure to meet the alkalinity criteria.Therefore, andplusmin;20 percent of the ``true value'' has been selectedas the approved criteria for total alkalinity. In the data from the PEstudies, at least 90 percent of the EPA and State laboratories are typicallyable to measure total alkalinity within andplusmin;20 percent of the truevalue when the active amount is greater than or equal to 30 mg/l.C. <T3>Monitoring Protocols</T3>As explained above, water suppliers would be required to monitor a varietyof parameters in order to demonstrate compliance with the proposed rule.These parameters include lead and copper levels at entry points to thedistribution system and at taps, and pH at taps. As described below, communityand non-transient non-community water systems would have different monitoringrequirements for determining compliance with the corrosion control treatmenttechniques of this proposal.For the purposes of averaging, all lead levels measured between the PQL(i.e., 0.005 mg/l) and the MDL (0.001 mg/l) would be averaged for the compliancedetermination. All lead levels below the MDL of 0.001 mg/l would be reportedas zero and averaged as such. Lead levels reported below an MDL largerthan 0.001 mg/l would be reported as that MDL and averaged as such.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Monitoring for Compliance with the MCLs</ITAG>Water suppliers would be required to sample water as it enters the distributionsystem after any treatment to determine compliance with the MCLs for leadand copper. Water suppliers relying solely on ground water would be requiredto take only one sample per year per entry point to the distribution system.Water suppliers relying on surface water as their source would be requiredto take one sample each quarter to account for seasonal variations in contaminantlevels. Water suppliers with both surface and groundwater sources wouldbe required to monitor quarterly all entry points to the distribution system.States would have the discretion to identify representative wells for sampling(if there is no treatment or blending) for systems with multiple wellsdrawing from the same aquifer.For the first round of MCL monitoring (which would last one year), historicaldata meeting the monitoring requirements specified in the proposed rulecould be used in lieu of new data if the historical data were collectedin a manner consistent with the final regulations. The total number ofsamples could be reduced by the use of composite samples at the discretionof the State. Combinations of samples from up to five sources would beallowed. If the concentration in the composite sample indicates that oneor more of the samples may exceed the MCL, follow-up sampling would berequired at each sampling point in the composite.Follow-up sampling would be required if the reported concentration of afive-sample composite exceeds the method detection limit. For copper, anaccurate analysis of one-fifth of the MCL is not a problem. For lead, however,the method detection limit is equivalent to the detection limit for thefurnace atomic absorption technique. Laboratories should determine theirmethod detection limit for this method by the procedure listed in AppendixB to 40 CFR Part 136. Laboratories should be able to achieve a method detectionlimit of 0.001 mg/l and data should be reported down to this concentration.If a laboratory is unable to achieve an MDL of 0.001 mg/l or lower, thensample compositing would not be permitted.If the result of one analysis exceeds the MCL for lead or copper, the systemwould be out of compliance and the procedures for public notification mustbe followed. However, States would have the discretion to allow one additionalsample to be collected as soon as possible (not to exceed two weeks fromthe date of the initial sample) at the same sampling location to verifythe original results. In this case, if the average of the two samples analyzedexceeds the MCL, the system would be out of compliance and procedures forpublic notification must be followed. If the average is less than the MCL,the system would be in compliance, the first sample results not withstanding.Systems exceeding the MCL would be required to sample more frequently thanthe minimum federally mandated requirements. The State must specify theincreased monitoring frequency.For community water systems, if there have been no violations for the mostrecent two years of monitoring, States could reduce the standard monitoringrequirements to as infrequently as once every five years for systems servingfewer than 500 persons and any system serving 500 or more persons whichis supplied only by ground water. For systems using surface water sourcesor a combination of surface and groundwater and serving more than 500 persons,monitoring could be reduced to once per quarter for one year, repeatedevery five years. No reductions in monitoring would be allowed for non-transientnon-community water systems.All systems would be required to begin monitoring to determine compliancewith the MCLs according to the schedule in Table 16.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,r90</C>Table 16._Starting Dates for Monitoring<H1>System size</H1><H1>Monitoring to begin no later than_</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;3,300<D>3 months after publication of final rule.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500-3,300<D>15 months after publication of final rule.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andless;500<D>27 months after publication of final rule.</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA is phasing in the monitoring by system size in the same manner it hasin previous NPDWRs to give systems time to learn about and implement thenew requirements and to ease the burden on analytic laboratories whichmay not be able to cope with a sudden increase in the number of samplesrequiring analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Monitoring for Compliance with the Corrosion Control TreatmentTechnique Requirement</ITAG>Compliance with the corrosion control treatment technique requirement wouldbe determined based on pH, lead, and copper levels at the tap. All systemswould be required to begin monitoring for compliance with the treatmenttechnique according to the schedule in table 16. Monitoring for each ofthese parameters at a targeted set of sample sites (see Section IV.C.2.a.i.for a discussion of how sites are to be selected) would be required quarterlyfor systems serving more than 3,300 persons, and less frequently for smallersystems. States may reduce monitoring frequency for systems serving morethan 3,300 persons once compliance is established. Because the lead andcopper no-action levels are measured as average and 95th percentile values,compositing is not allowed for samples collected to determine whether theno-action levels are met.Values for pH are not expected to vary throughout the day at any givenlocation, although they may vary among locations. However, lead and copperlevels at the tap do vary considerably depending upon a variety of factors,including the standing time of the water in the plumbing pipes. Determinationof whether the no-action levels were met would be determined by morningfirst draw and service connection samples. A morning first draw sampleis the first sample taken after water has stood in the building's plumbingovernight, or for 8-18 hours, without flushing. (Flushing means runningthe water without capturing the water for sampling.)A service connection sample is a sample of water that has been standingfor 8-18 hours in the building service connection (service line and otherconnections). Service connection samples may be collected by several methods.One is to flush the tap until there is a temperature change (decrease)in the water. The colder water is that which has stood outside the housein the service connection. Another method is to measure pipe length anddiameter from the tap to the service line and flush the volume estimatedto be contained in the household plumbing before the service connection.Once the house water is flushed, the service connection sample is collected.A final method of collecting a sample representative of a service connectionis to insert a sampling tap in the service line. However, this last methodhas the disadvantage of scraping bare a portion of the metal surface. Thisbare surface may result in temporarily high lead levels.Morning first draw samples and service connection samples must be one literin volume and collected at the cold water kitchen tap of targeted residences.Systems which have lead service connections would have to collect one halfthe required number of samples connection.EPA expects that for community water systems the residences sampled wouldgenerally be single-family houses, but systems could include apartmentsand other multiple-family housing where such housing constitutes more than20 percent of the housing served by the community. For non-transient non-communitywater systems, a morning first draw sample would be required from the tapor other outlet typically used to draw water for human consumption, ineach building served by the NTNC system. The rationale for these requirementsis as follows:andbullet; One of the important determinants of lead and copper levels indrinking water is the standing time of the water in plumbing pipes. Waterthat has not stood in the pipes (i.e., fully flushed water) will generallyhave the lowest lead and copper levels of any sample taken at that tap.Water that has stood in the pipes for long periods will have higher leadand copper levels; water standing in pipes 8-18 hours (``standing samples'')represents the highest levels that will routinely be found in drinkingwater. Standing samples would be required for several reasons. First, monitoringof water standing overnight, or some other specific long standing time(i.e., 8-18 hours), provides a consistent basis for measuring the progressof corrosion control treatment towards reducing levels of lead and copper.Standing samples represent the high end of actual human exposures are variableand are not known precisely (because people drink water from a varietyof sources and also water that has a variety of standing times), actualexposure to lead and copper via drinking water will generally be no higherthan levels found in standing samples.andbullet; Sample volume also has an important effect on lead and copperlevels in standing samples. The first 100 milliliters or so can have highlevels from leaching lead out of faucets because lead is used in the manufactureof brass and bronze, which are often used in faucets and fittings. Thenext 400-500 milliliters represent water standing in the pipes near thefaucet, and also may have high lead levels because of the numerous leadsoldered joints that can lead up to the faucet (Lassovszky, 1984). Takinga one-liter sample represents less extreme lead levels than those generallyfound in a smaller sample because the initial high concentrations willbe diluted by the later part of the sample, which contains lower concentrations.Because of the variation in lead levels with sample volume, EPA is proposingone liter as the standard sample volume for all samples. Although nearly all the data provided to EPA by systems has been collectedfrom one-liter samples, the question of the cost of shipping one-literbottles to the laboratory has been raised to EPA. One approach to reducethe weight and bulk would be to collect 500-ml samples instead. However,500-ml samples will generally show a higher proportion of lead concentrationfrom the faucet and a lower proportion from far and nearby lead solderedjoints, than will 1 liter samples. However, because it is unlikely thatan individual would consume an entire liter of water represented by a standingsample, EPA requests comment on an alternative sample volume of 500 ml.This alternative may better reflect a typical exposure. EPA estimates that500 ml samples will show consistently higher concentrations of lead andcopper than 1 liter samples, thus increasing the relative protectivenessof the proposed rules. An alternative approach to lower the weight would be to collect one-litersamples and transfer a 500-ml aliquot to another bottle for shipment andanalysis. The Agency is reluctant to adopt this approach because lead adheresto containers very easily. This increases the probability of sampling errorand would likely show a consistent, unacceptable downward bias. The Agencysolicits comment on this potential problem and possible approaches forminimizing it. a. <T3>Location of Sampling Sites. </T3>Because the likelihood of high leadand copper levels in drinking water is not randomly distributed among buildingsserved by a given public water system, EPA is proposing that monitoringfor compliance with the treatment technique requirement be targeted toresidences most likely to have lead problems. Targeting for copper is notnecessary because, in targeting for lead, copper corrosion problems shouldbe identified simultaneously. Lead, copper, and pH would all be measuredat the same set of residences. Systems would be required to identify asampling pool that includes 50 percent more sites than the number requiredfor monitoring each monitoring period (which varies by system size), toensure that systems can get access to an adequate number of sites. Thespecific residences to be actually sampled would be selected randomly fromthe targeted set of residences. Once the system monitors the minimum numberof sites, it would be required to use them every monitoring period. Ifone or more of these initial sites is no longer accessible, the systemmay, with State concurrence, substitute an alternative monitoring pointfrom its sampling pool with the same characteristics as the initial point.i. <T3>Targeted Monitoring and Materials Evaluation. </T3>To ensure that systemssample residences most likely to experience elevated levels of lead intap water due to corrosion, water suppliers first would be required toconduct a materials evaluation to identify an adequate number of thesehigh risk residences for monitoring. High risk residences are defined toinclude those that are at the ends of the distribution system and either:(1) Have lead service connections and/or lead interior plumbing; or (2)have lead solder that is less than five years old. ``Ends of the distributionsystem'' means those areas of low or no flow, sometimes known as ``dead-ends.''In communities where lead service connections are present, the group ofresidences selected would be required to include an equal number of residencesfor morning first draw and service connection samples. By targeting highrisk residences for lead sampling, EPA believes that the monitoring wouldbe more likely to identify high lead levels in communities where they exist,thus better assuring a high degree of public health protection. Targetingalso would reduce the number of samples required to provide this levelof public health protection. To conduct the materials evaluation and identify sites for targeted monitoring,each system would be required, at a minimum, to consider the informationidentified by the State pursuant to 40 CFR 141.42(d). As necessary, thesystem must consider: (A) Plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the communitybuilding department that indicate the plumbing materials installed withinresidences, including: andbullet; Lead in piping, solder, caulking, interior lining of distributionmains, alloys, and home plumbing; andbullet; Copper in piping, alloys, service lines, and home plumbing; andbullet; Galvanized piping, service lines, and home plumbing. (B) Inspections and records of the distribution system that indicate thematerial composition of the distribution lines, service lines, and connections.(C) Existing water quality information, including results of prior analysesof water in the system or from individual residences, indicating residencesin which the lead level of the water may be of concern.(D) Design plans of the distribution system indicating residences thatare served by the ends of the distribution system (i.e., areas of low orno flow). The evaluation could be conducted based on building permits and other records,inspections of the distribution system and buildings, information fromcustomers, or other means that reliably characterize the materials usedin the construction of the distribution system and plumbing in buildingsserved. In conducting the materials evaluation, the system would not berequired to examine every building served for the presence of lead materials.Water suppliers that assert that there are insufficient residences in eitherof the two targeted categories (residences at the ends of the distributionsystem with either (1) lead service connections and/or lead interior plumbing,or (2) lead solder less than five years old) would be required to documentthis assertion to the State as follows: 1. <T3>Lead service connections and interior plumbing. </T3>The system woulddocument via the materials evaluation that lead services, goosenecks, pigtails,or interior lead piping were never used in portions of the community servedby the ends of the system or have all been replaced. If this could notbe determined by records, the system would be required to inspect the servicelines and connections, and interior plumbing, of all housing and otherbuildings constructed before 1940 (few lead service lines were used afterthis date) and show that no service lines or connections, or interior plumbing,are composed of lead or lead-containing materials. 2. <T3>Lead solder. </T3>The system would demonstrate that the State or communityhas had in effect and has consistently and successfully enforced a banon lead solder use comparable to the Federal ban for five years, or thatno lead solder was ever used in construction or residences and other buildingsin the community served by the ends of the distribution system. If the public water system could not identify a sufficient number of residencesthat have the required characteristics, the public water system would berequired to demonstrate this to the State as described above and add tothe sampling pool, as equally distributed as possible, residences thateither: (1) Contain lead solder that is less than five years old; or (2)are serviced by lead service connections, as appropriate. If the publicwater system still could not establish a sampling pool sufficiently largeto meet the monitoring requirements of this section, the public water systemwould be required to add to the sampling pool a number of residences withlead solder (i.e., solder more than five years old) for sampling sufficientlylarge to meet the monitoring requirements of this section. While State approval of monitoring plans would not be required, Stateswould have the authority to disapprove any monitoring plan that does notmeet the targeting requirements. A system with a disapproved monitoringplan would be in violation of the regulations until the State approveda revised plan. EPA solicits comment on the proposed criteria for selecting the targetedsamples. ii. <T3>Non-Residential Monitoring Alternative</T3>. As described above, EPAis proposing that compliance monitoring be conducted at targeted residences.Based on information from hundreds of water suppliers which have successfullycollected standing samples from residences during the last ten years, theAgency expects that virtually all systems will be able to gain access tothe required number of residences, especially since many consumers willwelcome the information it provides them about the quality of their owndrinking water supply. Under the extremely unlikely event that a systemis unable to get access to take the required number of samples, EPA mayconsider allowing an exception to the requirement. Under this rare circumstance,the system would have to demonstrate to the State that it had made severalgood faith efforts to collect the required samples, including describingto each customer the direct benefits of the sampling. Then the system wouldhave to provide samples from other locations with plumbing characteristicsnearly identical to those encountered in targeted residences. For example,a PWS may be able to identify non-residential taps to supplement the accessibleresidential taps to reach the required number of monitoring sites. Thesenon-residential taps would be required to be connected to plumbing witha configuration and daily water use patterns very similar to those foundin single-family residences, to approximate lead levels that would be foundin such residences. A second approach might be for a PWS to construct aplumbing system to simulate that found in a home. This simulation wouldneed to be located at the ends of the distribution system, and have either(1) a lead service connection or lead interior plumbing (if there wereany lead service connections in the system or its customers' plumbing),or (2) lead solder that is less than five years old. The system would haveto assure that the water use patterns in this simulation closely resembledthose found in a residence, to ensure the lead levels measured approximatethose in private residences.   EPA requests comment on this and any other last-resort sampling approacheswhich may allow systems to obtain tap samples which represent the waterquality found in targeted residences.b. <T3>Number of Sample Sites. </T3>Two major factors affect the selectionof a suitable number of sample sites. First is the degree of certaintythat levels and prevalence of lead and copper in water have been identifiedaccurately (more samples result in greater certainty) throughout the community.Second is the cost and ease of implementation of the sampling system (moresamples are more costly and a plan requiring more samples may be more difficultto implement). In designing the sampling plan, EPA considered several importantdesign criteria. These include: The number of samples taken per monitoringperiod (by system size), the length of the monitoring period, the targetedmonitoring approach, and the desire to know in advance the maximum totalnumber of samples which would be required from each supplier. Having consideredthese factors and criteria, EPA has developed a proposal which is relativelylow in cost and easy to implement. It clearly defines the number of samplesrequired from each system and it requires the minimum number of samplesfrom small systems.EPA is also considering an alternative sampling plan and may adopt it inthe final rules. Compared to the proposal, this alternative would providegreater certainty about the lead and copper levels and reduce the monitoringcosts for large systems, but it may increase monitoring costs for smallsystems. EPA solicits comment on both the proposed and the alternativesampling plans described below. EPA is interested in how it might improvethe proposed approach to increase the certainty it provides regarding leadand copper levels and how it might improve the alternative to make it lesscostly to implement. In particular, EPA solicits comments on the proposedand alternative approaches to monitoring including the choice of standardlevels, appropriate numbers of samples, frequency of sampling, methodsfor evaluating sample results relative to the no-action levels, and thedesign of compliance rules within the context of a sampling and evaluationprogram.i. <T3>Proposed Approach. </T3>Under the approach proposed by this notice,the number of sample sites would be based on system size. Water supplierswould be required to monitor on this schedule starting by the date specifiedin Table 16. Under the proposed approach, the system would collect onesample from each sample site (i.e., targeted residence) according to thefrequency listed in Table 17 until compliance is established by meetingall no-action levels for at least one year or by completing implementationof a State-approved treatment plan (whichever is later). Thereafter Statemay reduce the required monitoring frequency for systems serving more than3,300 persons to a minimum of, one annual sample set taken during July,August, or September from each site. Systems serving 500-3,300 personswould take one sample set during July, August or September and repeat thesampling at least every two years. Systems serving fewer than 500 personswould take one sample set during July, August, or September and repeatthe sampling at least five years. Non-transient non-community water systemswould not be allowed to reduce their monitoring. Any additional samplestaken (beyond those required by the regulation) which a system wants touse to determine whether the no-action levels are met must meet the targetingcriteria discussed above.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,r90</C><T4>Table 17._Numbers of Samples and Frequency of Sampling for the Leadand Copper Corrosion Treatment Requirement Unless Reduced by the State</T4><H1>Population served</H1><H1>Number of samples</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;100,000<D>50/quarter.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001-100,000<D>30/quarter.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301-10,000<D>20/quarter.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500-3,300<D>10/year for 1 year, repeated every 2 years.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andless;500<D>10/year in one year, repeated every 5 years.</D></ITAG></ITAG>ii. <T3>Alternative Sampling Plan. </T3>EPA is also considering an alternativeto the proposed sampling plan and may adopt it in the final rules. Thisalternative, although somewhat more complex in design, would require, formany systems, fewer or an equal number of samples than required under theproposed sampling scheme.The alternative plan is based on a double sampling scheme developed byDodge and Romig (1959). The plan uses a two-tier approach. A supplier wouldbe required to obtain a relatively small number of samples in the firststage and then, based on the outcome of the initial sampling, would beeither relieved of further sampling for that monitoring period or requiredto obtain additional samples during that monitoring period to determinewhether the system was in compliance or needed to take further action.In localities where lead levels at the tap are generally either quite lowor quite high, sampling would probably be limited to the first tier.A benefit of this approach is that no system fails to meet a no-actionlevel (or alternative approved by the State after a system has demonstratedoptimization) on the basis of just one exceedance. However, this benefitcomes at a cost of increased sampling in some circumstances for the smallestsystems.Table 18 specifies the number of samples to be obtained for systems servingpopulations of various sizes (leftmost column). The following discussionexplains how the alternative sampling plan would be used to determine whethera PWS meets the no-action level for a maximum of 0.020 mg/l lead. Aftertesting the appropriate number of samples in Stage 1, a system would ``pass''and be excused from further sampling if no (zero) samples exceeded thelead maximum no-action level. If the number of such exceedances was greaterthan the specified allowable number (rightmost column), the system would``fail'' and also be excused from further sampling, but would be requiredto take further actions. For example, if the system has not yet installedor improved corrosion control treatment, it would be required to do so.In cases where the number of exceedances in Stage 1 was not greater thanthe allowable number, systems would be required to collect the number ofadditional samples indicated for Stage 2. Passing or failing would dependon the total number of exceedances in the combined groups of samples. Forexample a system serving 100,000 persons that obtained more than a totalof three samples with lead levels above the maximum no-action level in40 samples would fail and having to undertake corrosion control treatment.Figure 3 illustrates the decision process involved in applying this scheme.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,6,6,6</C><T4>Table </T4>18._<T4>Numbers of Samples Required in Stage </T4>1 <T4>and Stage </T4>2 <T4>of Double-Sampling Plan \1\</T4><H1>Population size</H1><H1>Number of samples</H1><H2>Stage 1</H2><H2>Stage 2</H2><H1>Allowable exceedances</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">andless;500<D>10</D><D>5</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500-3,300<D>10</D><D>10</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301-10,000<D>20</D><D>10</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,001-100,000<D>25</D><D>15</D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andgreater;100,000<D>30</D><D>20</D><D>3</D><F>\1\ Frequency of sampling would be the same as under the proposed approach.Stage 1 and Stage 2 samples would be taken in the same monitoring period.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Inset illustration 2759</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>If the samples are representative of the taps under consideration, applicationof this scheme provides 90 percent confidence that not more than 14 percentexceedances would occur among the taps (Svensgaard, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Monitoring Requirements for Non-transient Non-community Water Systems</ITAG>Non-transient non-community water systems would be required to monitorwater entering the distribution system once every five years for compliancewith the MCLs for lead and copper. To demonstrate compliance with the treatmenttechnique requirement, NTNC water systems would be required to monitorlead, copper, and pH (in a morning first draw or service connection sample)at least one tap annually during the months of July, August, or Septemberin each building served by the NTNC water system. The monitored tap wouldbe required to be the tap most frequently used for water consumption, suchas a kitchen tap.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Additional Data Collection</ITAG>EPA is currently collecting additional data to support this regulationfor lead and copper in drinking water, particularly data on lead serviceline replacement. EPA solicits any additional data on pipe replacementor any other aspect of this proposal from the public.EPA has developed a monitoring protocol for measuring lead in drinkingwater and guidance for using it which is more detailed than the protocolrequired under the proposed regulations. This more detailed protocol isavailable to the public from EPA. EPA welcomes data from samples takenunder this protocol which may help to answer any of the issues highlightedin this proposal.The monitoring protocol offers a means to determine whether a shorter standingtime such as 30 minutes may be successfully substituted for the 8 to 18hour standing time that would be required for morning first draw samples.In addition, the guidance would assist water suppliers in locating thesources of lead in drinking water (i.e., water mains, service lines, orinterior plumbing). This information would assist systems in establishingsampling points for targeted monitoring and for focusing public educationprograms.EPA may be able to provide technical assistance to a limited number ofwater suppliers which are interested in conducting extensive lead monitoring,and are willing to share all data with EPA in exchange for the support.Specifically, EPA is interested in before-and-after treatment data fromindividual residences served by water suppliers instituting corrosion controltreatment and before-and-after data from individual residences in communitiesreplacing PWS-owned or -controlled portions of lead service lines or connections.This information also could be used to assist decisions among the variousoptions described in this proposal, in particular. Data from various tapsamples taken before and after treatment would assist the Agency in furtherassessing the alternative of requiring replacement of lead service linesand connections under the ownership or control of water suppliers. Collectionof systematic data of this type also may allow the Agency to better estimatethe costs and benefits of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Notification</ITAG>Under section 1414(c)(1) of the Act, each owner or operator of a publicwater system must give notice to persons served by it of (1) any violationof an MCL, treatment technique requirement, or testing provision prescribedby an NPDWR; (2) failure to comply with any monitoring requirement undersection 1445(a) of the Act; (3) existence of a variance or exemption; and(4) failure to comply with the requirements of a schedule prescribed pursuantto a variance or exemption. The 1986 amendments required that within 15months of enactment, EPA amend its current public notification regulationsto provide for different types and frequencies of notice based on the differencesbetween violations which are intermittent or infrequent and violationswhich are continuous or frequent, taking into account the seriousness ofany potential adverse health effects which may be involved.EPA promulgated regulations revising the public notification requirementson October 28, 1987 (52 FR 41534). The regulations require that publicnotices for MCL, treatment technique violations and violations of a varianceor exemption (``Tier 1 violations'') contain mandatory health effects languagespecifying concisely and in nontechnical terms what adverse health effectsmay occur as a result of the violation. States and water utilities remainfree to add additional information to each notice, as deemed appropriatefor specific situations. Community water systems (CWSs) with Tier 1 violationsmust notify the public by newspaper or mail or hand delivery. Communitywater systems which fail to comply with any monitoring or testing requirements,which are granted variances or exemptions, or are required to give newspapernotice repeated quarterly by mail or hand delivery, with additional noticerequired at State discretion. NTNC systems may either notify in the samemanner as CWSs or post a notice continuously.Violations of the lead or copper MCLs or the treatment technique requirementsof this rule would be Tier 1 violations. Violations of the treatment techniquerequirement include but are not limited to any of the following:(1) Failure to submit or apply for (depending on system size) a treatmentplan by the date required, if required.(2) Failure to implement any treatment plan requirement by the date specifiedin the treatment plan, including failure to implement required corrosioncontrol treatment, failure to demonstrate to the State's satisfaction thattreatment is optimal, failure to continue required treatment.(3) Failure to design and implement a public education program, if required.For Tier 1 violations, EPA is proposing the following mandatory healtheffects language:LeadThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinking waterstandards and has determined that lead is a health concern at certain exposurelevels. Lead is a soft, dull, gray metal that has frequently been usedin water supply plumbing materials, especially flux, solder, pipes, andbrass and bronze fixtures. Lead usually contaminates drinking water asa result of the corrosion of these plumbing materials by the water theycarry. Lead has been shown to cause a variety of adverse health effectsin humans and animals. In humans, lead has been shown to interfere withthe formation of red blood cells (heme synthesis), cause anemia, causekidney damage, impair reproductive function, reduce birth weight, causepremature birth, delay physical and mental development in babies and youngchildren, impair mental abilities in children, and increase blood pressurein adults. Many of these effects have been observed at relatively low exposurelevels. Studies on animals indicate that lead may also cause cancer athigh doses. EPA has set an enforceable drinking water standard at 0.005ppm (parts per million) for lead leaving the treatment plant and enteringthe distribution system. EPA also requires public water systems to treattheir water to minimize lead contamination resulting from the corrosionof plumbing materials when lead in tap water that has been standing overnightexceeds an average of 0.010 ppm. Drinking water that meets these standardsis associated with little of this risk and should be considered safe todrink.CopperThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinking waterstandards and has determined that copper is a public health concern atcertain levels. Copper is an orange metal that is commonly used for plumbingpipes in homes and other buildings. Copper generally contaminates drinkingwater as a result of the corrosion of copper pipes by the water they carry.When copper corrodes, the water and sink are often stained green. Copperis an essential nutrient, but at high doses it has been shown to causestomach and intestinal distress, liver and kidney damage, and anemia. Personswith Wilson's disease may be at higher risk from copper toxicity than thegeneral public. EPA has set an enforceable drinking water standard forcopper at 1.3 ppm (parts per million) for water leaving the treatment plantand entering the distribution system. EPA also requires public water systemsto treat their water to control copper contamination resulting from thecorrosion of plumbing materials when copper in tap water that has beenstanding overnight exceeds 1.3 ppm in more than 5 percent of samples. Drinkingwater that meets this standard is associated with little to none of thisrisk and should be considered safe to drink.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Variances and Exemptions</ITAG>A. Variances from MCLs and Exemptions from the MCLs and Treatment TechniqueRequirementsUnder the Safe Drinking Water Act, variances from MCLs and exemptions fromMCLs and treatment technique requirements are permitted only if the grantingof the variance or exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk tohealth (URTH). Sections 1415(a)(1)(A) and 1416(a)(3). States with primacyhave authority to grant variances and exemptions.Variances from MCLs may be granted to water suppliers that have appliedBAT but which fail to meet the MCL using that technology. Section 1415(a)(1)(A).Variances from MCLs are generally designed to address cases in which thesource water is so contaminated that even application of BAT is insufficientto effectively reduce contaminant levels to below the MCL. Water suppliersthat obtain variances from MCLs must be placed on a schedule to come intocompliance with the MCL ``as expeditiously as practicable'' and must implementany additional control measures in the interim prescribed by the State.Exemptions from both MCLs and treatment technique requirements may be grantedto water suppliers due to compelling factors (including economic factors).Section 1416(a). Systems granted an exemption receive additional time toinstall BAT or the required treatment technique. The exemption may be extendedfor up to 3 years if the system makes certain showings. Section 1416(b)(2)(A) and (B). Systems which serve fewer than 500 persons may obtain extendabletwo-year extensions under certain conditions. Section 1416(b)(2) (C). Aswith variances, exemptions must include a schedule for compliance and requirementsfor implementing any necessary interim control measures.EPA is not now proposing to designate by rule a specific level of leador copper in drinking water that constitutes an unreasonable risk to health.To date, the Agency has not established in regulations URTH levels forany contaminant. However, as for other contaminants, EPA intends to publishguidance regarding what drinking water contaminant levels would constitutean unreasonable risk to health for States to use in deciding whether togrant variances or exemptions to public water systems. This guidance willbe available for public review and comment and will be completed by thetime the final regulation for lead in drinking water becomes effective.B. Variances From the Treatment Technique RequirementsThe Act also allows variances from treatment technique requirements, butthese are fundamentally different from variances from MCLs. Variances fromtreatment technique requirements are granted to water suppliers that donot need to implement the treatment because they have high quality sourcewater, so treatment is unnecessary to protect the health of persons servedby the water supply. Section 1415(a)(1)(B). Because of the design of the treatment technique requirement for corrosivityproposed in this rule, EPA believes that the need for variances from theproposal treatment technique requirement would be rare. Specifically, sincethe proposed rule requires systems to optimize corrosion control, i.e.,lower lead levels as much as technically feasible with corrosion controltreatment, by definition, all public water systems could comply with thetreatment technique requirements. The only case in which application of corrosion control treatment wouldnot be necessary or beneficial in reducing lead levels is the rare communitythat has no lead or copper materials in its plumbing and distribution system,including private residential plumbing. Such communities may include newtrailer home parks or other developments of prefabricated housing whichwere constructed using all plastic piping. If a water supplier could demonstratethat no plumbing materials containing lead have been used in the constructionof any homes in the community or in any distribution facilities, a variancefrom the treatment technique requirement could be granted. EPA solicits comment on granting of variances from the treatment techniquerequirements, especially whether there are other conditions under whichthe treatment technique may not be necessary or beneficial for reducinglead and copper exposures via drinking water. C. Point-of-Use (POU) and Point-of-Entry (POE) Devices and Bottled WaterEPA believes that central treatment should be the primary means of attainingMCLs and providing water equivalent to water treated as set out in an NPDWRprescribing a treatment technique, such as the corrosion control techniqueset out in this proposal. However, although the long-term goal for thesesystems is to comply with NPDWRs with centrally treated and distributedwater, under this proposal EPA would allow the State to require the useof POU devices or bottled water to avoid an unreasonable risk to health,as a condition of receiving a variance or an exemption. This may be especiallyappropriate in the case of exemptions for small systems, i.e., systemswith less than 500 connections, because their exemptions may be extendedfor one or more two-year periods. The goal of application of non-centraltreatment or bottled water is to provide water of equivalent quality tothat which would be provided by a traditional well-operated central treatmentfacility. In prescribing the use of POU devices, the State would be required to imposethe conditions outlined below. If a PWS distributes bottled water as acontrol measure, the PWS must ensure that one of the following conditionsis met: (1) The bottled water must be subject to a monitoring program that providesadequate assurances that the water meets all MCLs. The public water systemmust monitor the bottled water for lead and copper and all other MCLs inthe first quarter that it supplies water to the public, and annually thereafter.Results of the monitoring program would be provided to the State annually;or (2) The public water system must receive a certification from the bottledwater company that (a) the bottled water supplied has been taken from an``approved source'' as defined in 21 CFR 129.3(a); (b) the bottled watercompany has conducted monitoring in accordance with 21 CFR 129.80(g)(1)-(3);and (c) the bottled water does not exceed the MCLs or quality limits setout in 21 CFR 103.35. The public water system would be fully responsiblefor the provision of sufficient quantities of bottled water to every personsupplied by the public water system including delivery via a door-to-doorbottled water delivery system. These conditions constitute the minimum standards for protection of publichealth. Point-of-entry devices for removal of lead or copper from drinking waterwould not be allowed to achieve compliance with this proposed rule becausethey do not prevent lead or copper from entering the water after it leavesthe device. Many such devices provide reverse osmosis (RO) or ion exchangetreatment, and can actually make water more corrosive, potentially resultingin higher lead levels at the tap. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. State Implementation</ITAG>The primary implementation agencies for drinking water regulations arethe States. Fifty-four out of 57 jursidictions have applied for and receivedprimary enforcement responsibility for the public water supply supervisionprogram (primacy). To implement the federal regulations for drinking watercontaminants, States must adopt their own regulations which are at leastas stringent as the federal regulations. This section of today's proposaldescribes the provisions the States would be required to adopt to implementthis proposed rule.  One of the deficiencies in the existing program implementation regulationsin 40 CFR Part 142 which EPA plans to correct in an NPRM later this yearis that the regulations do not require States with primacy to revise theirprograms following EPA promulgation of new or revised NPDWRs or to adoptthe new or revised requirements, nor do they specify a procedure for doingso. EPA intends to propose amendments which would require States to revisetheir programs following the promulgation of new or revised NPDWRs to maintainprimary enforcement responsibility. Under the SDWA, EPA has had a strongand continuing policy of approving only those State programs that adoptedthe full EPA program, e.g., all NPDWRs; States cannot obtain partial orconditional primacy. EPA intends to continue this ``full primacy'' policyas it implements the 1986 SDWA amendments. (Partial primacy would be confusing;the State would be implementing part of the program and EPA the other,and it would be unclear which provisions of Federal and state law appliedto a given public water system.)  As part of the amendments to the primacy regulations, EPA is planning topropose procedures for revising State programs that are similar to thosein Part 142 for obtaining initial primacy. The amendments would requireStates to meet the basic requirements for obtaining primary enforcementresponsibility (see 40 CFR 142.10) for each new or revised NPDWR and anyprimacy requirements specific to the new or revised NPDWR which EPA hasestablished. It is anticipated that such regulation-specific requirementswould be necessary only in those situations where the NPDWR provides flexibilityto the State on how to accomplish a particular requirement. If these regulation-specificrequirements are needed, EPA will promulgate them at the same time it promulgatesthe NPDWR. Today's proposal includes regulation-specific requirements thata State would be required to include in a program revision to adopt theproposed lead and copper NPDWRs. EPA solicits comments only on these specificrequirements. Comments on the broader changes to the primacy requirementsin Part 142 will be solicited when those changes are proposed. Today EPAis also proposing the changes to the reporting and recordkeeping requirementsneeded to implement the lead and copper NPDWRs. EPA also solicits commentson these requirements. EPA's proposed changes to Part 142 are explainedbelow.A. Special Primacy Requirements for States To Adopt 40 CFR Part 142, SubpartI_Control of Lead and Copper  The regulations proposed at 40 CFR Part 141, Subpart I, Control of Leadand Copper, provide the State discretion with regard to how the objectivesof the rule are achieved. For instance, the State must approve a system'sdemonstration that it has minimized the corrosivity of its water and mustapprove the system's final operating parameters. In these cases and otherinstances where the State has discretion, State regulations would be requiredto augment the general national regulations to establish enforceable requirementsand to inform each public water system to what specific requirements itis subject.  To ensure that the State program includes all the elements necessary foran effective, enforceable program, this notice proposes that to obtainapproval of a program revision to adopt the NPDWRs for lead and copper,the State's request for approval would be required to include the following: (1) The procedure or criteria the State will use for determining the frequencywith which a system must monitor, including the monitoring frequency aftera system has exceeded the lead or copper MCL. The State must include aprocedure for notifying the system of the new monitoring requirements withwhich it must comply and for enforcing these requirements.  (2) The requirement for a materials evaluation to identify monitoring locations,specifying the elements which must be included in the evaluation. Further,the State must specify how a system can demonstrate to the State that sufficientresidences with the required characteristics for monitoring are not available. (3) The procedures/criteria the State will use to evaluate treatment planssubmitted by systems serving more than 3,300 persons, to develop treatmentplans for systems serving fewer than 3,300 persons, to approve treatmentplans, and to evaluate treatment and public education performed by systemsunder the treatment plans, in accordance with proposed andSection; 141.85.The State must also specify (a) the criteria it will use to determine thatcorrosivity has been minimized if the system is still not meeting the no-actionlevels after installing or improving treatment, and (b) a method of informingthe system of its new approved operating parameters.  (4) The criteria the State will use to evaluate data submitted by a systemon the effectiveness of its public education program and to determine whetherthe system must modify subsequent public education efforts.  (5) Procedures the State will use to provide systems serving 3,300 or fewerpersons with treatment plans.B. State Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  In this notice, EPA is proposing changes to the existing reporting andrecordkeeping requirements to implement the proposed lead and copper NPDWRs.These changes would require States to keep records of:  (1) Any system which has been allowed to reduce the frequency at whichit monitors for compliance with (a) the lead and copper MCLs and/or (b)the no-action levels which trigger the treatment technique requirements,or other approved operating parameters.  (2) Any system which is required to perform increased monitoring and thefrequency of that monitoring.(3) Approvals of treatment plans as specified in proposed andSection; 141.84.(4) All determinations that systems that have finished implementing treatmentplans have begun meeting the no-action levels or have minimized the corrosivityof their water.(5) All evaluations of public education programs and of all determinationsthat systems are required to modify subsequent public education programs.This proposal would also amend the State reporting requirements to implementthe lead and copper NPDWRs. States would be required to provide EPA quarterlya list of systems which:(a) May reduce their monitoring frequency in accordance with proposed andSection;141.86 (c) and/or (d)(4).(b) Are required to increase their monitoring frequency in accord withandSection; 141.86(c)(4).(c) Have received State approval for their treatment plan, or for systemsserving 3,300 or fewer persons that have received a treatment plan fromthe State.(d) Have successfully demonstrated that optimal corrosion control has beeninstalled. This report should indicate whether the system is now meetingthe no-action levels or operating under other parameters approved by theState. In the latter case, the report should specify the new parameters.States would also be required to report any evaluations of public educationprograms and any determinations that a system must modify subsequent publiceducation programs. Under the existing regulations, States must provideEPA a summary of violations of primary drinking water regulations; therefore;no additional requirement for reporting violations to EPA is specifiedin this proposal.EPA solicits comments on all the proposed changes, including recordkeeping,reporting, and the special primacy requirements, to Part 142 to implementthe NPDWRs for lead and copper also proposed today. Comments should specificallyaddress the appropriateness of these requirements, the effect of thesenew requirements on State programs, and the ability of the State to implementthe requirements of the rule. C. System Reporting and Recordkeeping RequirementsIn order to facilitate implementation and enforcement of the regulationsproposed today, water systems would be required to maintain records ofand report to the state information relating to the proposed regulation.Systems that serve more than 500 persons would be required to report tothe State the results of all monitoring required by this subpart within10 days of the end of each calendar quarter the system is in operationfor any period of time. Systems that serve 500 or fewer persons would berequired to report such results to the State within 10 days of the endof each calendar year such system is in operation for any period of time.All systems would be required to certify that the information submittedis accurate. To the extent systems perform more monitoring than requiredby the proposed regulations, the systems would be required to include theresults of the additional monitoring in their reports to the State. Systemswould be required to include the identification and location of samplingsites monitored in their reports of monitoring data.Systems operating under an approved treatment plan would be required to,according to a schedule established by the State, report to the State thesystem's progress in completing the treatment plan's interim steps. Allsystems applying corrosion control treatment, would be required to reportany changes in treatment, including changes to treatment for purposes otherthan corrosion control and cessation of treatment due to mechanical oroperating failures, within 14 days of the change in treatment.Systems operating under an approved treatment plan containing a publiceducation program would be required to report the system's progress incompleting the public education program requirements in the reports submittedto the State. If the public education program is being targeted to particularsegments of the consumer population, a description of how this targetingis consistent with the proposed regulations would be required to providedata to the State that indicate that, as a result of the public educationprogram, the users' knowledge about lead in drinking water enables themto alter voluntary their water use patterns to reduce consumption of lead-contaminatedwater.The proposed regulations would also establish a general reporting authority,which would allow the Administrator to require a system to establish andmaintain such records, reports, or information as the Administrator deemsnecessary to determine whether the system has acted or is acting in compliancewith the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Review by the Science Advisory Board</ITAG>As required by the SDWA, EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) was offeredthe opportunity to review this proposal. They met on June 2 and 3 1988in Cincinnati, Ohio. The SAB's comments will be considered and factoredinto the final rule together with the comments from the public receivedduring the comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Impact of this Regulation</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisUnder Executive Order 12291, this action is a major regulatory action,because it will have a major financial or economic impact on the country.As required by the Executive Order, EPA conducted a Regulatory Impact Analysis(RIA) that is available for review as part of the docket for this rulemaking(EPA 1988a).

About 66 systems would exceed the proposed MCL forcopper at the entry point to the distribution systems and thus need totreat their source water. On an annualized basis, the compliance costsfor the lead and copper MCLs would be about $60 million.There are cost impacts associated with the treatment technique (corrosioncontrol and public education) requirements as well. These impacts havebeen broken into three tiers, reflecting the stepped nature of the proposaland its alternatives. Systems would incur treatment costs when they failto meet the no-action levels. Approximately 53,000, or 66 percent of allsystems would be expected to incur costs under the proposed treatment techniquerequirements. On an annualized basis, corrosion control treatment optimizationdemonstration and public education would result in costs of about $221million.Monitoring costs would be incurred by all of the approximately 79,000 communityand non-transient, non-community systems. EPA estimates that the nationalannualized cost of monitoring for this proposal would be about $12 millionper year (Table 20).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,6</C><T4>Table. 20._</T4><T4>Monitoring Costs of the Proposed Lead and Copper Requirements*</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Systems Affected<D>79,000</D></ITAG>National Cost ($M1988)<ITAG tagnum="2">Annual Monitoring<D>12</D></ITAG>Cost per Family by System Size ($1988/year/Household)<ITAG tagnum="2">Very Small (25-500)<D>$0.88</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Small (501-3,300)<D>0.30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Medium (3,301-50,000)<D>0.19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Large (over 50,000)<D>0.02</D></ITAG>Total Annual Cost of Monitoring ($M1988)<ITAG tagnum="2">Very Small (25-500)<D>$1.60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Small (301-3,300)<D>2.20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Medium (3,301-50,000)<D>6.90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Large (over 50,000)<D>1.40</D><F>* Rounded to two significant digits.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The entire proposal, including both the MCL and treatment technique requirementsfor lead and copper, would require about 54,000 systems to add $980 millionin capital equipment, and incur $200 million per year to operate and maintainit. Monitoring costs are expected to be $12 million per year. State implementationcosts are estimated to increase by approximately $16 million. On an annualizedbasis, the cost of the rule is expected to be nearly $280 million for capital,operation and maintenance, monitoring, and State implementation.The uncertainty in the costs, particularly for small systems, has not beenfully evaluated. Based on comments and further analysis, an addendum tothe draft Regulatory Impact Analysis to be completed when this rule ispromulgated will evaluate these uncertainties.<ITAG tagnum="81">Benefits</ITAG>The systems that incur the costs of complying with the proposed rule arelikely to be the same systems that experience the health and materialsbenefits. The materials benefits of this regulation may be as high as $500million per year. These benefits would pay for the entire cost of thisrule if considered on a national basis.The Agency evaluated the expected health benefits of the proposed rule.The Agency estimated the number of children who would be expected to experiencedecreased blood lead levels as a result of reduced water lead levels. Inparticular, EPA examined the effects of changing the water lead distributionexperienced by people served by systems which are expected to install orimprove corrosion control treatment after missing the no-action levels.In the first step of the analysis, EPA estimated the proportion of childrenexpected to have their blood lead levels reduced to below 10, 15, or 25ug/dl as a result of reductions in water lead levels (Marcus and Holtzman,1988). EPA estimates that about 138 million people are served by PWSs thatwould be expected to install corrosion control treatment (EPA 1988a). Ofthese, about 8.8 million are children aged 6 months to 5 years. Therefore,EPA estimates that 264,000 to 704,000 children in this age group wouldhave blood lead levels reduced to below 10 ug/dl, 88,000 to 176,000 childrenwould have their blood lead levels reduced to below 15 ug/dl, and 3,500to 5,300 would have blood lead levels reduced to below 25 ug/dl. The estimatesare presented in a range to reflect the uncertainty regarding the waterlead levels that would result from compliance with the proposal. Other groups of the exposed public would also be expected to experiencebenefits from the proposed rule, including fetuses, infants, older children,and adults. The particular types of health effects that would be avoidedby these persons are discussed in <T3>Reducing Lead in Drinking Water: A Benefits Analysis</T3> (EPA, 1986a).However, the Agency has not calculated the proportion or number of personsin each of these categories who would be brought below specified bloodlead levels. Figure 4 summarizes the health effects associated with various blood leadlevels of concern. These include reduced IQ and stature decrements in children,premature birth, low birthweight, slowed mental and physical developmentin fetuses and infants, and hypertension in adult men. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2 792 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>The Agency also considered the relative benefits of the proposed approachcompared to those which might be expected to occur if one or more of thealternatives discussed above were adopted. In each case, the actual outcomeof adopting an alternative approach is uncertain. Therefore, Table 21 presentsa qualitative comparison of the proposal with the alternatives. Costs,benefits, administrative complexity, and enforceability are considered.Expected net benefits are listed as the same as the proposal, less thanthe proposal, or greater than the proposal. For example, difficult problemsof implementation could limit the reductions in water lead levels thatmight otherwise be expected from adoption of an alternative. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>TABLE 21._COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSAL <H1>Alternative </H1><H1>1 </H1><H2>Annual Costs </H2><H3>MCL </H3><H3>Corr.

Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisThe Regulatory Flexibility Act requires EPA to explicitly consider theeffect of regulations on small entities. If there is a significant effecton a substantial number of small systems, the Agency must seek to minimizethe effects. With respect to the requirements of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 602 <T3>et seq</T3>., today's action will not have a significant effect ona substantial number of small entities.Using the Small Business Administration's definition, a small water utilityis one that serves fewer than 50,000 people. There are about 78,000 suchsystems. Of these, approximately 53,000, or 68 percent, are likely to havecontamination levels greater than the MCLs or no-action levels specifiedin this proposal, and thus would be required to treat their water; thisrepresents a substantial number of systems. The approximate cost of producingwater by all systems serving fewer than 50,000 people is $9 billion peryear, and the maximum annualized cost of the proposal would be about $281million, including monitoring. This amounts to 3.1 percent of water productioncosts for small systems. EPA believes that an increase of this magnitudedoes not represent a signficant economic impact. Therefore, although therule will affect a substantial number of small systems, the average effecton small systems as defined by the Small Business Administration wouldnot be significant.Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that, due to their inability to benefit fromeconomies of scale, the cost impact of regulations tends to increase asthe size of a system decreases. In order to prevent these regulations fromplacing an onerous burden on smaller systems, EPA has included numerousprovisions in the proposal which would enhance their ability to comply.Among these provisions are:1. The monitoring requirements of the rule are phased in over an extratwo to three years for small systems.2. Fewer samples are required for compliance with both the maximum contaminantlevel and treatment technique parts of the rule.3. Small systems are required to monitor less often than large systems.Instead of monitoring quarterly, systems serving less than 50,000 peoplemay monitor annually or once every five years.4. States may take system size into account when determining appropriateelements of the treatment plan, including corrosion control and publiceducation requirements for a given system.The Agency encourages States to provide technical assistance to small systemswhich need to install or improve corrosion control. The assistance couldinclude tailoring the treatment plans they provide to small systems tothe circumstances of individual public water systems. Further, under theSafe Drinking Water Act, exemptions are available for systems serving fewerthan 500 persons if they cannot afford to install best available technologyto meet the requirements of an MCL or treatment technique requirement technology,provided there is no unreasonable risk to health. These exemptions maybe extended as necessary.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>. An Information Collection request has been prepared byEPA (ICR No 0270.12) and a copy may be obtained from Eric Strassler, InformationPolicy Branch; EPA 401 M Street, SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 orby calling (202) 382-2709.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from an average of 1 to 1.4 hours per response, including timefor reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Request for Public Comment</ITAG>Throughout this proposal, EPA has requested public comment on many issuesand approaches related to this regulation. Many of the major issues forcomment are repeated here for the convenience of those who wish to commenton this proposed rule.1. Should EPA control corrosion by-products with MCLs or a treatment technique?2. Is an MCL measured at the tap to control both lead from source waterand as a by-product of corrosion appropriate? What would be the basis forselecting the level? What monitoring requirements should apply? Shouldsystems that have installed BAT and still cannot meet the MCL at the tapbecause of private plumbing be considered permanently out of compliance?3. Should EPA establish national requirements for lead service line replacement?4. EPA solicits data on contributions of lead service lines and other leadconnections to lead levels at the tap, and on lead levels after corrosioncontrol treatment is in place.5. EPA solicits data on the effect of partial and full lead service linereplacement programs on lead levels at the tap.6. Should EPA reduce to 500 ml the sample size for determining whethera system meets the no-action levels and/or the source water MCLs for distributedwater?7. Should EPA adopt one or more of the following alternatives to this proposal:Treating the fourth no-action level, a maximum of 0.020 mg/l of lead measuredas the 95th percentile of targeted samples, the same as the first fourno-action levels; adding total alkalinity of 30 mg/l as an additional no-actionlevel to trigger treatment; requiring a system to replace lead servicelines and connections that are found to contribute significantly to leadin tap water even after installation of optional corrosion control; a two-tieredapproach to monitoring which may increase the efficiency of sampling, sofewer samples might be required of most public water systems; and eliminatingpH as a no-action level?8. Should the MCLs for lead and copper apply at the entry points to thedistribution system or to fully flushed water at the consumer tap?9. Should EPA require water suppliers to adjust corrosion control treatmentto account for any blending of water from different sources? How? Pleaseprovide any data to support any alternative approaches.10. Should EPA raise the maximum no-action level for lead to 0.030 mg/l(if it is adopted as a no-action level that triggers treatment) to assurethat this alternative could be feasibly implemented; and/or substitutethe no-action level of 0.020 mg/l for lead for the average of 0.010 mg/lfor lead and pH and alkalinity measures?11. What information should be included in the public education program?12. Would the proposed public education program and/or any other similaractions reduce exposure to potentially excessive levels of lead in drinkingwater?13. Are the proposed analytical techniques technically adequate and economicallyfeasible?14. Are the PQL acceptance limits for copper and lead appropriate?15. Are the proposed criteria for selecting the targeted samples appropriate?16. EPA requests additional data on samples in accordance with EPA's leadmonitoring protocol. EPA is especially interested in corrosion controltreatment data which compares lead levels in morning first draw samplesbefore treatment and levels after treatment.17. What specific level of lead or copper in drinking water constitutesan unreasonable risk to health?18. Should EPA allow variances and exemptions from the proposed rule? Arethere other conditions (in addition to those described) under which thetreatment technique may not be necessary or beneficial for reducing leadexposures via drinking water?19. Are the requirements that a State would be required to include in aprogram revision to adopt the lead and copper NPDWRs proposed in this regulationappropriate?21. What will be the effects of the proposed requirements on State programs?<ITAG tagnum="84">XII.

Lead is a soft, dull, gray metal thathas frequently been used in water supply plumbing materials, expeciallyflux, solder, pipes, and brass and bronze fixtures. Lead usually contaminateddrinking water as a result of the corrosion of these plumbing materialsby the water they carry. Lead has been shown to cause a variety of adversehealth effects in humans and animals. In humans, lead has been shown tointerfere with the formation of red blood cells (heme synthesis), causeanemia, cause kidney damage, impair reproductive function, reduce birthweight, cause premature birth, delay physical and mental development inbabies and young children, impair mental abilities in children, and increaseblood pressure in adults. Many of these effects have been observed at relativelylow exposure levels. Studies on animals indicated that lead may also causecancer at high doses. EPA has set an enforceable drinking water standardat 0.005 ppm (parts per million) for lead leaving the treatment plant andentering the distribution system. EPA also requires public water systemsto treat their water to minimize lead contamination resulting from corrosionof plumbing materials when lead in tap water that has been standing overnightexceeds an average of 0.010 ppm. Drinking water that meets these standardsis associated with little of this risk and should be considered safe todrink.(14) <T3>Copper. </T3>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)sets drinking water standards and has determined that copper is a healthconcern at certain exposure levels. Copper is an orange metal that is commonlyused for plumbing pipes in homes and other buildings. Copper generallycontaminates drinking water as a result of the corrosion of copper pipesby the water they carry. When copper corrodes, the water and sink are oftenstained green. Copper is an essential nutrient, but at higher doses ithas been shown to cause stomach and intestinal distress, liver and kidneydamage and anemia. Persons with Wilson's disease may be at higher riskfrom copper toxicity than the general public. EPA has set an enforceabledrinking water standard for copper at 1.3 ppm (parts per million) for waterleaving the treatment plant and entering the distribution system. EPA alsorequires public water systems to treat their water to control copper contaminationresulting from the corrosion of plumbing materials when copper in tap waterthat has been standing overnight exceeds 1.3 ppm in more than 5 percentof samples. Drinking water that meets this standard is associated withlittle to none of this risk and should be considered safe to drink.4.

Systems are to select single-family houses,except that they may include apartments and other multiple-family housingwhere such housing constitutes more than 20 percent of the housing servedby the community. This group of residences must be served by the ends ofthe distribution system and have plumbing systems that either contain leadsolder that is less than 5 years old or have lead service connections orinterior lead pipes. To the extent possible, the group of residences shallhave an equal number of residences from each of these two categories. Toidentify these residences, systems must use the information collected bypursuant to andSection; 141.42(d) of this part. As necessary, systems mustalso review the following: (A) Plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the communitybuilding department that indicate the plumbing materials installed withinresidences; (B) Inspections and records of the distribution system that indicate thematerial composition of the distribution lines, service lines, and connections;(C) Existing water quality information, including results of prior analysesof water in the system or individual residences, indicating residencesin which the lead level of the water may be of concern; and (D) Design plans of the distribution system indicating residences thatare served by the ends of the distribution system. (ii) The number of residences in the sampling group must be no less than50 percent greater than the number of sample points required for compliancewith this section. If, based on the materials evaluation, a community watersystem cannot identify a sufficient number of residences with the specifiedcharacteristics, the system must demonstrate this to the State by:(A) Submitting a report on the materials evaluation documenting that leadpipe was never used for service lines, goosenecks, pigtails, or interiorplumbing pipes or that all such plumbing has been replaced, in those portionsof the community that are served by the ends of the distribution system;and/or (B) Demonstrating that the community has had in effect and successfullyenforced for a minimum of five years a ban on lead solder use or that nolead solder was used in the construction of residences in those portionsof the community served by the ends of the distribution system. (iii) A system that meets either of the conditions in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)of this section must add to the sampling group, as appropriate, dependingupon which of the conditions in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section ismet, residences located elsewhere within the distribution system that either:(A) Are served by lead service connections; or (B) Contain lead solder that is less than five years old. If the communitywater system still cannot establish a sampling group sufficiently largeto meet the monitoring requirements of this section, the system must addto the sampling group the number of residences with lead solder servedby the ends of the distribution system, irrespective of the lead contentof the system and the age of lead solder in plumbing of the residences,that will increase the size of the sampling group sufficiently to meetthe monitoring requirements of this section.(iv) States may disapprove proposed monitoring plans. Systems with disapprovedplans must revise the plans and obtain State approval before monitoringcommences. A system with a disapproved monitoring plan is in violationof this section until the State approves a revised plan. (2) <T3>Sample collection. </T3>Community water systems must obtain a one-litersample of water from the cold-water kitchen tap of each residence monitoredin the sampling group each monitoring period. In residences selected becausethey have new lead solder, the system must collect a morning first drawsample. In residences selected because they have lead service connections,the system must collect a service connection sample. The service connectionsample consists of a sample from: (i) The tap after the morning first draw water changes temperature;(ii) The tap after flushing the water in the household plumbing (calculatedbased on pipe diameter and length to the tap from the connection); or (iii) Directly from the service line itself.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In residences with both new lead solder and a lead service connection,the system may take a morning first draw sample and a service connectionsample and count it as two residences in its pool. Systems must take subsequentsamples from the same residences that were sampled during the initial monitoringperiod, except that, to the extent this is not possible, systems may, withState concurrence, take a sample from another residence remaining in thesampling group with the same characteristics as the initial site.
