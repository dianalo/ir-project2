For Minnesota Mining, the acquisition of the Spontex unit of Paris-based Chargeurs S.A. is an important move to expand its cleaning-products business into markets in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Britain. The unit has world-wide sales of about $166 million.    Coming in the face of a weak dollar, however, the deal is also a bet by Minnesota Mining that the 1992 elimination of many significant European trade barriers is an opportunity too appealing to pass up.    The year &quot;1992 is going to change the way people do business {in Europe}, and we want to be prepared for it,&quot; said Allan J. Huber, an executive vice president of Minnesota Mining, of St. Paul, Minn. &quot;The borderless concept of '92 no doubt gives us much more flexibility in the manufacturing and distribution of our products.&quot;    It is a quandary likely to face many U.S. multinationals in coming months. The low dollar makes European acquisitions expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so. But like other U.S. companies, such as General Motors Corp. and Whirlpool Corp., which have plunged into the European market in recent months, Minnesota Mining swallowed doubts about the dollar to pursue a strategic acquisition that fit its global-growth strategy.    &quot;We didn't look at it so much on dollar terms, as we did on the overall return,&quot; said Mr. Huber. &quot;It really all boils down to whether this acquisition has a large strategic value, which we obviously concluded it does.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Minnesota Mining closed at $61.50 a share, up 75 cents.    So far this year, aggressive foreign acquirers led by Canadian, British and Japanese concerns have feasted on U.S. companies. With overall takeover activity expected to pick up this fall, Wall Street's merger community has been scrutinizing European targets for U.S. multinational clients who want to get the jump on the opportunities of 1992.    &quot;Every major multinational is actively looking to expand its position in Europe between now and 1992,&quot; said Robert Pirie, chief executive of Rothschild Inc., a Wall Street merger boutique that specializes in U.S.-European deals. &quot;Companies believe, if you're going to be a player in Europe, you need to be buying now.&quot;    Mr. Pirie's firm helped arrange one of the largest U.S. acquisitions of a European company this year when General Motors' Hughes Aircraft unit agreed in April to buy a British maker of flight simulators, Rediffusion Simulation, for $283 million. That deal, like the Minnesota Mining acquisition, was struck for purely strategic reasons; it gave Hughes 40% of the British market for military flight simulators.    &quot;We're seeing much more attention being paid by American companies to the European market,&quot; said Jeffrey A. Rosen, an investment banker specializing in international transactions with Wasserstein Perella andamp; Co. &quot;They're still groping for the right strategies and the right alternatives, but they are far more willing to start discussions on these matters than they were a year ago.&quot;    An alternative to a merger is a joint venture with a European partner, an option chosen by Whirlpool last month when it agreed to create the world's largest major appliance business with N.V. Philips. The venture, based in the Netherlands with an immediate 10% stake of the European major-appliance market, is a significant move by Whirlpool to establish itself in Europe by 1992.    No one expects the trend toward European acquisitions to rival moves by foreign firms on U.S. soil, at least not this year. The main reason is price. &quot;We've had people look over there, but it's so darned expensive,&quot; says one investment banker. &quot;It's got to be a real good fit to make a deal worth it at this point.&quot; U.S. acquirers also face stiff competition from European suitors, like Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, who have fueled an unprecedented takeover spree this year.    Not all U.S. companies are so sanguine about Europe. &quot;You hear a lot of rumors about deals over there {but} it seems like an unnatural act for U.S. companies to prowl for acquisitions in Europe,&quot; says a senior official of a Big Three auto maker. &quot;There's a lure of 1992. I just don't think anybody is going to mortgage the farm to go for 1992 right now.&quot;    For U.S. suitors with the stomach for European prices, British companies remain the top prizes, thanks to the ease of doing business there and few restrictions on corporate ownership. West Germany remains among the toughest markets to make a major acquisition, investment bankers say, largely because of rigid rules on stock ownership. </TEXT></DOC>
