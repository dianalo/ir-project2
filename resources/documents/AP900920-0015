The administrative law judge presiding over the case has severaloptions, including recommending a stronger charge against Bush thanthe one proposed by federal regulators, a government attorney saidWednesday.   Bush, 35, was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and LoanAssociation, a Denver thrift that failed in November 1988 at anestimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. Bush resigned in August1988, just after his father received the Republican presidentialnomination.   The Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking an order againstBush that effectively could bar him from working for a bank or asavings and loan.   The agency contends Bush failed to adequately disclose toSilverado his business relationships with developers Kenneth M.Good and Bill L. Walters, two big borrowers from the institution.   Bush has denied any wrongdoing.   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson won't make animmediate decision on the case after the hearing that beginsTuesday in Denver, OTS Chief Counsel Harris Weinstein toldreporters at a briefing.   Davidson is expectedt we have as much at stakeas we did in World War II,'' Kerrey said in a floor speech.   In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Eagleburger said it is onlyreasonable that the United States approach allies who benefit fromthe defense of Middle East oil fields and ask them to help shoulderthe cost.   ``I know it creates some constitutional problems we're going tohave to sort through,'' he told subcommittee chairman Rep. DavidObey, D-Wis. ``But on the other hand, I don't think you would knockus for going around the world and trying to tell the otherbeneficiaries ... that we ought not to have to pay for all of thisourselves.''   So far, Eagleburger said, the gulf states have pledged $12billion, Japan $4 billion, Germany $2 billion and the EuropeanCommunity $2 billion.   Obey agreed that allies should share the cost, but attackedBush's request to set up a ``National Defense Gift Fund'' as ``oneof the most spectacular end runs on the Constitution ... I haveever witnessed.''   In separate votes, the full House and its Appropriations defensesubcommittee moved to require that any money raised from allies bespent only by Congress.   The defense subcommittee took its action as it moved ahead withBush's request for an additional $1.9 billion to pay for the gulfmilitary mobilization in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept.30.   Eagleburger argued Wednesday that Congress should approve thecancellation of Egypt's $6.7 billion in military debt, sayingCairo's already weak economy is suffering a $3.7 billion addedshock from the gulf crisis.   He said Bush feels strongly that the gesture was important as apublic show of support for Egypt and for President Hosni Mubarak.   Members of Congress have voiced appreciation for Mubarak'sleadership, but also are wary of the size of the reward at a timewhen budget cutters are being forced to hack away at favoritedomestic programs.   Eagleburger said Israel, whose foreign aid package hastraditionally been linked to the size of Egypt's, also would begetting more from the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
