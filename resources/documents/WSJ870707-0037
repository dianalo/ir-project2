Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) has announced his intention to reintroduce a bill to prohibit such awards unless the Pentagon certifies that the work couldn't be done as effectively by U.S. companies. The Glenn bill has a good chance of passing; the Senate approved the legislation last year, and this year the House already has adopted a similar measure introduced by Reps. Les AuCoin (D., Ore.) and Charles Bennett (D., Fla.).    Japan would be the fifth U.S. ally to sign an agreement to participate with the U.S. on SDI, or &quot;Star Wars,&quot; research into anti-missile defense systems. But Tokyo could be hit hardest by congressional restrictions. The Glenn bill would exempt contracts already awarded under four earlier SDI pacts -- with Britain, West Germany, Israel, and Italy -- but it would apply to all those signed after the bill's enactment.    A spokesman for Sen. Glenn said his bill wouldn't necessarily &quot;put a lid on all overseas SDI contracts.&quot; He said some contracts could still go to Japanese companies if they agree to undertake their research in the U.S., employing U.S. scientists and other resources, or if they can perform the research at less cost than U.S.    Although the Pentagon declined to comment on the accord with Japan until a briefing scheduled for today, Japanese sources indicated that the pact spells out conditions under which Japanese concerns can participate in Pentagon-funded Star Wars research. The pact gives the participants the right to use technology developed under this program, but also recognizes U.S. ownership of the technology, the sources said.    The agreement, which was first reported in Tokyo, comes at a time when Congress is raising questions about the trustworthiness of Japanese contractors. While the agreement can take effect without Senate ratification, lawmakers could erect other roadblocks to participation of Japanese contractors besides Sen. Glenn's bill.    Toshiba Corp., for one, would be banned outright from participation under a Senate trade-bill amendment that drew an overwhelming 92-5 vote of approval last week. The amendment would ban the giant electronics producer from nearly all trade with the U.S. for as many as five years as punishment for its suspected part in illegal shipments of milling machines to the Soviet Union. It is believed the Soviets wanted the machines to develop &quot;quiet&quot; propellors that make their submarines much more difficult to track.    Japanese companies themselves have strong reservations about participating in Star Wars research. Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren, said it sought additional talks with the Pentagon to win assurances that U.S. companies won't have access to Japanese participants' technological secrets.    Moreover, in deference to pacifist public opinion, Tokyo wanted its accord less secret than similar pacts between the U.S. and Israel and the European allies.    There was no hint yesterday from either government how these concerns were handled. But Japanese sources acknowledged that the bulk of the agreement will still be secret, more in line with U.S. preferences.    The Pentagon has identified certain fields where Japan has technological achievements equal to, or even superior to, those of the U.S. These include electro-optic and millimeter-wave devices, both of which have possible Star Wars applications.    The list of possible Japanese participants in SDI research includes integrated electronics producers like NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. They have well-funded research programs on radiation-hardened gallium arsenide devices, and other advanced integrated circuits that could be adapted for space-age battlefield management systems.    Meanwhile, C. Itoh andamp; Co. reacted strongly to U.S. news reports that it could be shut out from Pentagon contracts for its role in the Toshiba shipments. Norio Negishi, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based trading company, said C. Itoh brokered the sale without being aware that a Toshiba unit misrepresented the contents of the shipments to export-control authorities.    The Pentagon said it has suspended contracts with Toshiba and other companies involved in the shipments until Tokyo authorities can either clear them or establish their guilt. </TEXT></DOC>
