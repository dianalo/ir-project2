Our long-term objectiveis to have 20 percent of our bank in Arizona, 20 percent in Texasand the balance in other places.''   Federal Home Loan Bank Board officials guaranteed $83.9 millionin assistance for MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan to absorb FirstFinancial _ A Savings Association in El Paso, and BrownfieldSavings and Loan Association in Brownfield.   The transaction announced Wednesday was part of the SouthwestPlan, a federally-funded plan to recapitalize and consolidateailing thrifts.   MeraBank officials still do not know how much in outstandingloans they will have to write off, said Arthur Gonzalez, presidentof MeraBank's Texas division.   He said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts' loanportfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inheritedfrom the ailing thrifts.   ``This acquisition...was a little unusual in what we agreed todo with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board without lots ofinformation,'' Gonzalez said.   MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan of Phoenix, the largest thriftin Arizona and 25th largest in the country, has $6.4 billion inassets.   MeraBank, which already has seven branches in Texas, iscontributing $8.8 million in new capital to the deal to acquireFirst Financial, with $330 million in assets, and Brownfield, with$40 million.   MeraBank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent Texasthrift later this year as part of the transaction. It is forming aseparate subsidiary, MeraBank Texas, to hold the three Texasinstitutions.   Bank board officials said they expect MeraBank Texas toconsolidate all its operations in Texas within six to nine months.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures Sandamp;Ldeposits up to $100,000, will hold warrants for 20 percent of thesubsidiary's stock, officials said.   First Financial and Brownfield are the ninth and 10th savingsand loan cases resolved by federal regulators in Texas this year,while 40 nationwide have been resolved.   The state's institutions, hard hit by slumps in the oil industryand real estate valuations, accounted for $3 billion of theindustry's $3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year.   Regulators say 133 of Texas' 279 thrifts are insolvent undergenerally accepted accounting rules. The bank board hopes to reducethe number of savings and loans in Texas by about 150 this year.   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said MeraBank's expansion inTexas ``will benefit Texas, the thrift industry and FSLIC.''   The third thrift to be acquired by MeraBank, which is based inPhoenix, Ariz., would create a deal worth about $1 billion, Ricesaid.   Thrift industry officials said a $1.2 billion loss at SunbeltSavings Association of Dallas boosted losses by Texas' savings andloans to $3.5 billion during the first three months of 1988.   Operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five statesserved by the Dallas office of the bank board widened during thefirst quarter of 1988 to $1.1 billion from $623 million in 1987.   Non-operating losses, primarily funds set aside to covernon-performing assets, increased to $2.8 billion from $609 million.</TEXT></DOC>
