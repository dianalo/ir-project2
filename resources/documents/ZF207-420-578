 In the industry's view,Benetton's commercial success is linked intrinsically to its well-planned andextensive IS strategy.andP;  But the story isn't quite that simple.andM;When Bruno Zuccaro took up his position as the company's MIS manager in 1984,he walked straight into a crisis.andP;  &quot;There were a lot of people leaving,applications were old, there was no new development and people weren'tmotivated,&quot; recalls Zuccaro.andP;  Worse than that, he adds, the existingdata-processing manager wasn't prepared to think big, but the company wasalready headed in that direction.andM;Things have changed.andP;  &quot;Four years ago, we had two problems--redesign allexisting systems and implement new systems,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Today, we'veredesigned 70% of our systems.andP;  IS is three times bigger than it was in1984.&quot;andM;The Benetton InstinctandM;One thing strongly in Zuccaro's favor as he faced this challenge was thesupport of company founder and director Luciano Benetton, whose strategic ISdecisions, say insiders, are based more on instinct than on formal costjustifications.andM;&quot;Benetton is founded on the concept of centralizing the production anddistribution phases that add the highest value to product lines anddecentralizing less important phases,&quot; explains Luciano.andM;Instinct has done Luciano little harm so far.andP;  Since the days when hewandered the streets of Milan selling sister Giuliana's colorful sweaters, hehas built up a group of companies that produces over 50 million garments ayear, has 4,000 points of sale in 60 countries (soon to include the SovietUnion) and manufactures in Brazil, France, Italy, Scotland, Spain and theUnited States.andP;  Giuliana's sweaters now share space with underwear,sunglasses, watches, perfume, shoes, school and office supplies, and bed andbath linens, all bearing the Benetton logo.andP;  And in 1987, Benettondiversified, setting up In Holding, a holding group for a range of financialservices companies.andM;&quot;Benetton's market is, for reasons of product and target, very dynamic,evolving rapidly,&quot; says Luciano.andP;  &quot;Following, managing and anticipatingtrends and changes in the conditions of this market is possible thanks to theconsiderable contribution of the company's information systems.&quot;andP;  Thatcontribution amounts to around 1.3% of the company's global revenue.andM;This budget comes under the control of IS chief Zuccaro, who, friends say,has two hobbies--skiing and work.andP;  At work, the restructured computer centerand network system is his pride and joy.andP;  Benetton uses a 30 millioninstructions per second IBM 3090 280E for production and an 11 MIPS IBM 3090150E for development.andP;  He chose the relational data base management systemSUPERA because, he explains, DB2 wasn't ready when he made the relationalDBMS decision two years ago.andM;Last year, Benetton spent 1.3 billion ($4.1 million at L731 = $1) onrelational DBMS development, and in 1989 the company will increase thatamount by some 33% to L4 billion ($5.5 million).andP;  Zuccaro points out that thecompany considers relational DBMS to be the most important development in ISto come along in years.andP;  About 2.5 gigabytes of Benetton data are onrelational systems today.andM;Networks in use include the General Electric Information Services Co.andO;(GEISCO) Mark III, which Benetton has used since 1985, and the Mark 3000,recently integrated with the Mark III system.andP;  Benetton began to use the MarkIII network in 1988 for electronic data interchange (EDI) with its 75independent agents, each in charge of retail operations in one geographicarea.andP;  Document movement time has been trimmed over 20% with the Mark IIIsystem, and the time it takes to clear exports through customs has beengreatly reduced.andP;  Benetton claims it is pioneering the use ofintercontinental EDI in the textiles industry.andM;The Mark 3000 has a tracking system for agents, so they know which items arein production, which are in the warehouse and which have been shipped.andP;  Atthe end of March.andP;  Benetton added a customer credit service to the network toenable agents to keep track of customer billing.andM;The distribution division's monument to high technology is the automatedwarehouse in Gastrette, a stone's throw from Benetton's Ponzano headquarters.andO;Operational since 1986, the warehouse cost more than $57.6 million to buildand outfit.andP;  A Digital VAX minicomputer directs robots via remote control.andO;The robots read bar codes on boxes, sort them and store them in logicalareas.andP;  Storage and retrieval movements are made in one pass for economy.andM;The robotics, by Fiat's industrial automation subsidiary COMAU, has beenbuilt to handle up to 12,000 individual boxes per day rather than the normalpallets of boxes.andP;  There is space in the warehouse for 25,000 boxes of ninedifferent sizes.andM;Robots in the WarehouseandM;&quot;The warehouse is the logistical heart of Benetton's systems,&quot; says Luciano.andO;&quot;It's the point at which the flow of products coming from diverse productionunits converges and the distribution flow of the system explodes.andM;With a sophisticated distribution system in place, the major IS challenge for1989, Zuccaro says, in the design of a production system that will serve thecompany in the years of growth and change ahead.andP;  Efficient, market-targetedproduction, including design, color studies, cutting and dyeing, is crucialto Benetton's success, he adds.andM;&quot;We need ideas,&quot; Zuccaro says.andP;  They are also looking at expert systems--oneis in development--that will help provide a method to estimate the complexityand productivity of IS projects.andP;  Zuccaro complains that expert systems arestill a marketing product, not a production product.andM;Designer LasersandM;A recent example of how Benetton has employed technology in the productionprocess is a laser disk system that aids in designing seasonal clothingcollections.andP;  Designers used to go to the warehouse to look over passseasons' clothing models, since about 20% of new models are designed from oldmodels.andP;  These trips were time consuming.andM;With the laser disk system, clothing models are photographed and made intoslides, which are transferred to videotape.andP;  The video is linked to a laserdisk attached to an IBM PC AT.andP;  The personal computer has a data base ofinformation on each piece of clothing in each collection.andP;  Pieces are codedby item number, season and fabric group name (or &quot;family&quot;).andP;  A design teammember can request all trousers from the family &quot;city&quot; from the men'sSpring/Summer 1986 collection, for example, and the computer displays thecorrect models.andP;  Five years of collections, about 10,000 images, are on disk.andO;The system will hold 50,000 images.andM;While Benetton ports the newest technologies to its slightly remote Ponzanosite, the company prefers to recruit IS staff locally, a difficult feat for acompany headquartered northwest of Venice, far from any major metropolitancenter.andP;  But local recruits mean lower attrition rates.andP;  In order tocomplement the needs of its own operations, Benetton started a softwarecompany called In System, located in nearby Treviso.andP;  Zuccaro confides that,&quot;it's difficult to mix cultures within a company--mainframe and midsizesystems--and software companies are scarce here.andP;  In System helps us solvethe problem by giving us a good 'outside' consulting company we can workwith.&quot;andM;Vision Versus RealityandM;In contrast to the exemplary automated distribution and production systems,Benetton's office automation is not what it could be.andP;  Of 15 first-levelmanagers, only one uses a personal computer, while all 45 second-levelmanagers use them.andP;  But office automation is slated for growth and, setting agood example, Luciano recently installed a PC on his desk.andP;  &quot;As one hungryfor the new,&quot; he says, &quot;I couldn't resist the appeal of the personal computerand am learning  to use it.andP;  It continuously fascinates me.&quot;andM;But sometimes, the Benetton staff finds, Luciano has been known to show anoverzealous dedication to technology.andP;  One manager tells of the time a yearor so ago that luciano became fixated on the paperless office concept.andP;  Heordered the commercial department to stop using paper, since systems werewell automated and computers abounded.andP;  &quot;The poor people had to work withoutpaper records for about a week,&quot; the manager recalls.andP;  &quot;But then they startedto sneak paper back in to use, and Luciano realized after all that paper isnecessary.&quot;andM;Now IS chief Zuccaro admits he's a bit worried about what Luciano has in mindfor the future of IS at the company.andP;  Luciano has set up a meeting withZuccaro to talk about the &quot;after the computer era&quot; at the company.andP;  Zuccaro'sguess is that Luciano wants to start using the computer more as a motivator,and not just as a data-processing tool.andM;&quot;He says that it's not enough to know what we sold,&quot; explains Zuccaro, &quot;butwe need to know what we should have sold and that we lost X dollars by notrealizing our potential.&quot;andM;What Luciano Benetton wants next, says Zuccaro, is a system that gives peopleincentives.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
