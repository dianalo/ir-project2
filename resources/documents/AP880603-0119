(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At least two of the five city directors inthis tobacco market center are reconsidering their support of asmoking ban following objections from a local tobacco company.   A policy banning smoking in the main lobby of City Hall, CityCommission chambers, the city bus station and a handful of otherplaces took effect Wednesday over protests from Pinkerton TobaccoCo., Daviess County's largest industrial employer.   Owensboro is a major tobacco sales center for western Kentuckyburley. The Daviess County Farm Bureau estimates that area tobaccosales topped $25 million last year.   Pinkerton, in a letter dated May 20, notified Mayor DavidAdkisson that it will reconsider plans to expand in the countybecause of the ban.   ``If, as it appears, your recent enactment of a ban on ourproducts is indicative of this community's attitude toward thetobacco industry, our company and our products, then the time hascome for us to begin rethinking our plans for the future,'' LutherPittman, executive vice president of Pinkerton, wrote.   Pinkerton, which employs 504 people at its Daviess County plant,is the nation's leading manufacturer of loose leaf and plug chewingtobaccos, Pittman said. The company also makes smoking tobaccoproducts.   Pittman said his letter does not mean the company is planning topull out of Daviess County.   But Pinkerton is in the process of acquiring smoking tobaccobrands from The American Tobacco Company in Richmond, Va., he said,and had planned to move manufacturing and distribution operationslinked to such an acquisition to Owensboro.   Adkisson said he did not consider Pittman's letter a threat bythe company to leave town. The smoking ban passed unanimously andAdkisson said he still supports it.   But Commissioner Jack Ross, who voted with the three othercommissioners and the mayor to approve the policy, said Thursdaythe board overreacted.   And Commissioner Waymond Morris, principal of Daviess CountyHigh School, said he ``probably will vote to rescind'' the policy.   He said the policy ``is doing something we didn't intend todo,'' namely, offending tobacco interests.   Another commissioner, Alan Braden, said he is still weighing thepolicy's benefits against its effects on tobacco interests.   Adkisson said that in the past Pinkerton has produced mostlysmokeless tobacco, and he didn't think about the company beingadversely affected.</TEXT></DOC>
