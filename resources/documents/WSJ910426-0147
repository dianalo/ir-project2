The Israeli Defense Forces calculated that Patriotsdestroyed only about half of the 16 Scud missiles fired atdefended areas in Israel in the time the Patriots weredeployed, Raytheon said. But Raytheon said that assessmentwas too tough.</LP><TEXT>   The Israelis didn't credit the Patriot with a kill unlessthe missile essentially vaporized the incoming Scud, Raytheonsaid. If a piece of the warhead or fuel tank hit the ground,that was considered a miss. &quot;They counted holes in theground,&quot; a Raytheon spokesman complained.   The Patriot has been considered the wonder weapon of theGulf war, with televised images of missile battles boostingRaytheon's image and stock price. But critics recently havecontended that the Patriots didn't do much to limit damagefrom the Scuds, which fell apart on their own in flightbecause of poor Iraqi engineering. Patriots could actuallyincrease ground damage, the critics said, by cutting Scudsinto many parts but not demolishing them. The parts wouldthen smash into the ground, followed by the Patriots.   In a long statement yesterday, Raytheon counterattacked.The company said that if the proper measure were used, thePatriot had a 90% success rate in Saudi Arabia and an 85%success rate in Israel. According to that definition, whichwas used by the U.S. Army, a Patriot was credited with asuccessful intercept if it demolished the Scud warhead orpushed it out of the 15-mile area defended by the Patriot.Ground damage didn't count.   But Theodore Postol, a Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology professor who led the Patriot criticism, said theIsraeli measure was more accurate than Raytheon's. &quot;It'sdamage on the ground that counts,&quot; he says, &quot;not interceptsin the sky.&quot; Casualties and damage by Scud attacks againstIsrael actually increased after Patriot batteries arrived inthe Jewish state, according to Israeli newspapers.</TEXT></DOC>
