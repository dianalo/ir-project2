(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The battle over abortion will involveyoung people today as the Vietnam War did in the 1960s, former U.S.Rep. Bella Abzug told female political activists today.   ``Abortion is the Vietnam of this nation for young peopleeverywhere,'' Abzug told the opening session of the NationalWomen's Political Caucus' Biennial Convention.   Abzug, a former Democratic representative from New York and afounder of the caucus 18 years ago, was the first of severalspeakers who are expected to address the abortion issue. The caucusruns through Sunday.   ``No civilized nation can be allowed to declare an unborn fetusa person under the Constitution before women are declared personsunder the Constitution,'' Abzug said.   On Thursday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Browntold the steering committee that the Democrats lost a chance to winthe 1988 presidential election by not doing more to garner votesfrom women.   ``In fact, we blew a major gender gap that might have carriedthe Democratic candidate for president to the White House,'' Brownsaid.   Brown said he understands ``the frustrations of working in thecoalition.'' But he said those who counsel the formation of a thirdparty ``ignore the second half of the adage that begins, `United westand.'   ``No matter where the struggle for justice ... divided we willindeed fall and fail to reach our goals,'' he said.   ``I have worked in the struggle for civil rights my entire adultlife, and I do not deny the problems of advancing a cause throughthe Democratic Party,'' Brown told the steering committee of theNational Women's Political Caucus.   ``But the alternative is self-righteous failure. It may feelgood when the first speeches are made, but it will be very, verytragic when the votes are counted.''   Brown told reporters later that the creation of a women'spolitical party probably would hurt Democrats more thanRepublicans, but he added, ``I don't think it's going to hurtanybody because I don't think it's going to happen.''   No action similar to NOW's is expected at the National Women'sPolitical Caucus biennial convention, according to Irene Natividad,head of the caucus. The convention, which officially convenedtoday, is expected to attract 1,500 delegates and guests.   Brown also touched on the battle over abortion because ofrestrictions allowed under a July 3 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.   ``The Supreme Court and the right wing of this country threatenwomen's rights and all of our rights,'' Brown said.   He said the Democratic Party platform supports the right of awoman to choose whether to have an abortion, as well as suchproposals as an Equal Rights Amendment.   An invitation to Republican National Committee Chairman LeeAtwater to address the leaders of the non-partisan caucus wasdeclined, Natividad said.</TEXT></DOC>
