Newsweek magazine quoted an unidentified Reagan administrationofficial last week as saying China planned to sell Syria its newestM-9 missiles, which have a range of 372 miles.   Syria can already hit most of Israel's territory with itsSoviet-made Frog-7, SS-1 and SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles thathave a range of 37, 160 and 62 miles respectively.   But Israeli reports said the M-9 missiles could be placed deeperinside Syrian territory, making retaliation more difficult.   ``I can certainly understand why the prospect of a sale of a newmissile to Syria would cause great worries here,'' Lewis said.   ``I'm sure that it will be, if it is not already, a matter ofserious discussion between the United States and China ... but howmuch real effect we would have on Chinese decisions I'm veryskeptical.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, saidon Israel radio he had no confirmation that Syria purchased theM-9s. But he said Israel was deeply concerned about any missilesSyria possesses.   ``Now you know the Syrians have missiles of their own from theRussians ... and they have developed a chemical warfarecapability,'' Ben-Aharon said.   ``In other words, there is a source of threat, very formidable ... We are concerned to a very large extent over thesedevelopments.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is visiting the United States andis expected to raise the Chinese missile sale issue with U.S.officials.   Ben-Aharon said Israel's response to the reported sale should be``military and political and diplomatic.''   ``With regard to the military, we have to exercise, to investmaximum effort in order to develop the kind of countermeasures thatwould neutralize this threat,'' he said.   Ben-Aharon did not elaborate. However, army chief of staff Lt.Gen. Dan Shomron warned last week that Israel would respond to thedeployment of Syrian missiles in various ways, including attacks onmissile sites.</TEXT></DOC>
