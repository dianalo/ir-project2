In this invention, a Si-substrateis sectioned in a plural number of single crystal Si region by silicon-oxidefilm, and GaAs single crystal film is grown on a single crystal siliconregion and GaAs poly-crystal film is grown on a silicon oxide film. Therefore,the stress caused by the difference of thermal expansion coefficientbetween Si-substrate and GaAs substrate into the GaAs polycrystal regionrelaxes, enabling us to attain thicker GaAs single crystal film; therefore,a high performance GaAs semi-conductor device can be formed on a Si-substrate.With this invention, Si-substrate has specific gravity only 1/2 and costonly 1/10 of GaAs substrate attaining better output and cost per unitweight.
