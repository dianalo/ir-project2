GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Burmese army has forced hundreds ofpolitical prisoners to take part in brutal jungle marches thatresulted in scores of deaths, with many of the victims pro-democracystudent protesters, sources say.   The dissidents were trucked from prisons in Rangoon in earlyAugust to the northeastern town of Namtu and blindfolded during thelast stage of the journey, the sources said. They were thenreportedly forced to become porters for the military.   ``Those who stumbled and fell and were unable to march werebrutally beaten to death,'' said a report received in Bangkok fromthe Kachin Independence Organization, one of several ethnic rebelgroups fighting the central government.   On Friday, a spokesman for Burma's military government, Col. AungThein, denied the report. Since then, three other independentsources have provided confirmation with varying degrees of detail.   ``We understand that political prisoners were conscripted toserve as porters in the north,'' one Western diplomatic sourcecontacted in Rangoon said. ``There they were given virtually nothingto eat, made to walk barefoot, abused and taunted.''   The Kachins said the prisoners were bound together by ropes in achain _ hand-to-hand, foot-to-foot _ and forced to each haul heavyloads of rice over rough, jungle terrain from Mongmawo-Mongyin toNamtu, a distance of about 25 miles.   They were stripped, beaten and taunted by the army escorts whoshouted: ``This is what democracy is all about!,'' the Kachins said.   The sources said up to 500 prisoners were involved in the marches.   A junta of military officers on Sept. 18 declared a coup andbrutally ended months of pro-democracy demonstrations in theSoutheast Asian nation. New arrests began in late July followingsmall-scale protests and the arrest of several leading oppositionfigures.   The U.S. State Department last week charged that thousands hadbeen arrested during the past seven weeks and some tortured whileunder detention.   ``The United States government condemns these acts ofoppression,'' spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.   The Kachin report quoted one porter who escaped military controlon Aug. 12 as saying he saw 14 students who had died after beingbeaten. The porter said at least three to four students died daily,and he quoted guards as saying the prisoners were deliberately beingmarched to death in the Namtu area.   Villagers living along the Namdu-Mongmawo-Mongyin road told theKachins they were forced by the military to bury the dead. Thecondition of the surviving prisoners was not known, the sources said.   One source, who asked not to be identified, said he saw the grouprounded up in a football stadium in Namtu before the marches began.He estimated that two thirds were people in their 20s while the restwere between 30 and 40 years of age. About 20 women were reportedlyamong the prisoners.   There have been numerous previous reports of forced conscriptionsof civilians and brutal treatment of porters by the Burmesemilitary. Some porters who escaped have been interviewed byjournalists along the Thai-Burmese border.   Last year, the London-based human rights group AmnestyInternational published two reports it said showed ``a consistentpattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmesemilitary.   Kachin as well as Palaung and Shan rebel groups operate in theNamtu area. The sources said that the rice carried by the prisonershad been confiscated from villagers by troops of the Burmese Army's99th Light Infantry Division who claimed it had been stored by thelocals for the Kachin insurgents.</TEXT></DOC>
