Treaty</HEAD><BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior United Nations officialpredicted Washington would ignore a World Court ruling that saidthe United States violated a U.N. treaty by trying to close thePLO's New York office.   In an advisory opinion issued Tuesday, the International Courtof Justice, as the court is formally known, ordered the UnitedStates to submit to arbitration in its dispute with the UnitedNations over the Palestine Liberation Organization's observermission to the United Nations.   The court is the judicial arm of the United Nations. It has noenforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to itsrulings.   The Reagan administration's dispute with the U.N. arose fromlegislation signed into law by the U.S. Congress in December thatclassifies the PLO as a ``terrorist organization'' and bars it fromoperating on American soil.   The U.S. government maintains that the anti-terrorist law takesprecedence over any international agreements.   Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany, the U.N.undersecretary-general for legal affairs, told reporters afterTuesday's ruling that he doubted the United States would submit toarbitration.   ``We want harmonious relations with our host country,''Fleischhauer said. ``We are ready to go to arbitration. It is nowbasically for the United States government to decide whatconclusions it draws from this ruling.''   ``It is a pleasure to be proved right,'' Fleischhauer's boss,U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said of the rulingduring a press conference in New York.   Although the court took pains to dodge the question of whetherWashington's attempt to close the PLO office is legal, the rulingwas seen in Vienna as an implicit condemnation of the U.S. effort.   The court said the U.S. Justice Department's shutdown orderviolated the Headquarters Agreement by not submitting the issue toarbitration first. That 1947 pact between the Truman Administrationand the U.N. guarantees diplomats unimpeded access to U.N.headquarters in New York.   ``The United States is bound to respect the obligation to haverecourse to arbitration,'' said the court's 15 judges.   The Headquarters Agreement mandates independent arbitration ofany disputes arising from it, but the United States has rejectedany such arbitration.   The opinion marked the second time in two years the court hasruled against the United States. In the previous case, brought byNicaragua, the United States boycotted the proceedings and ignoredthe court's order to halt its support for rebels trying tooverthrow the Managua government.   The PLO was granted permanent observer status by the U.N.General Assembly in 1974, and its U.N. mission has been operatingever since out of an office in Manhattan. Its information office inWashington, D.C., was closed prior to the passage of theanti-terrorist legislation.   Early this year, the U.S. government said arbitration of the PLOmission issue was premature, and noted that the anti-terrorist lawwould only come into force on March 22.   When the PLO refused to comply with U.S. Attorney General EdwinMeese III's March 22 order to close its New York operation, theU.S. government filed suit in a New York federal court. Thatlawsuit is pending.   Washington's attempt to close the PLO office has been condemnedby every U.N. member nation except Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
