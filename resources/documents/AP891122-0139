(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery was set to light up thesky tonight in a dazzling holiday liftoff that may be visible forhundreds of miles as the shuttle streaks toward orbit with fiveastronauts on a secret military mission.   The Thanksgiving Eve launch was scheduled sometime between 6:30p.m. and 10:30 p.m. If a forecast of clear skies holds, the700-foot geyser of fire from the craft's solid fuel booster rocketscould be visible over a 700-mile track from Key West to Charleston,S.C.   But while the weather here looked favorable, Air Forcemeteorologists said it had deteriorated at an overseas emergencylanding runway, a location called a trans-Atlantic abort site orTAL, that is needed for launch.   Without revealing the overseas site because the shuttle's routewas classified, Air Force spokesman Ron Rand said: ``The weather atthe TAL site does not look good, and it doesn't look like it'sgoing to get better.''   He said observers at the site, believed to be Ben Guerir AirBase in Morocco, would continue to monitor the situation and hopefor a break as the Discovery countdown continued.   Technicians during the day pumped 528,000 gallons of liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants into Discovery's 154-footexternal fuel tank, and NASA reported no problems with thecountdown.   ``The countdown is on schedule; everything is going fine,'' NASAspokeswoman Lisa Malone reported today. Shuttle crews had made up12 hours' preparation time lost last week in replacing a faultyrocket control unit.   Forecasters said the weather should be 80 percent favorable fora launch, raising confidence that the astronauts will have turkeyin space on Thanksgiving.   An accident involving a truck pushing a forklift into a bunkernear the launch pad late Tuesday will not affect the mission, NASAsaid. The bunker contains lasers used to position the shuttleprecisely on the pad, but they were not damaged.   Because the shuttle's satellite is classified, the Pentagon willnot permit NASA to disclose the exact launch time until nineminutes before liftoff. But it is expected to be about 7:30 p.m.   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.   Military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it moredifficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship offCape Canaveral to track the shuttle.   Critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because theSoviets, with their intelligence capability, undoubtedly alreadyknow a great deal about the mission and that once Discovery is inorbit, they will be able to track it precisely and know what isdoing.   Sources close to the project reported the astronauts are todeploy a $300 million 2{-ton signal intelligence satellite designedto eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in theSoviet Union and other countries. A similar satellite was releasedon another shuttle flight in 1985.   The flight crew is headed by Air Force Col. Frederick C.Gregory, the first black named to command a shuttle flight. Theothers are Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and three missionspecialists, Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave andKathryn C. Thornton.   The menu for the mission includes ``thermostabilized'' turkeyand gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to becarried without refrigeration.   ``We are hopeful the crew will have Thanksgiving dinner inspace,'' said Dick Young, spokesman for the National Aeronauticsand Space Adminstration.   The launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttlemissions. Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col. John Blaha,practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jetequipped to handle like a shuttle.   The expected four-day mission will end with a nighttime landingat Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.   Gregory and Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in thedark here or at emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in caseof an abort after liftoff.</TEXT></DOC>
