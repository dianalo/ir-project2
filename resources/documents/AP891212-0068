Similar demonstrations also took place Monday in the capitalcity of Porto Novo, Ouidah and Abomey, with reports of violence andone death.   The ban was announced by radio Monday evening following themarch by 40,000 in Cotonou, Benin's economic capital.   Last week, Kerekou announced the government was scrapping itsMarxist-Leninist ideology and would draft a new constitutionliberalizing the economy and guaranteeing human rights.   The government has been unable to pay bills, including thesalaries of thousands of government employees.   Western economists say Kerekou's efforts to impose centralizedcontrols on the economy has hampered growth. In recent months,several scandals have further tarnished his image, including thearrest of two associates on drug trafficking charges.
