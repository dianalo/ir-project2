We have developed a computer program to model circumstancesof this nature with recognition of the crucial role played by such psychologicalproperties as fear, excitement, peer pressure, moral outrage, and anger,together with the distribution among participants of intrinsic susceptibilitiesto these emotions. This report extends previous work to consider twogroups of people in adversarial encounter, for example, two platoonsin battle, a SWAT team against rioting prisoners, or opposing mobs ofdifferent ethnic backgrounds. Closely related applications of the modelinginclude prowling groups of predatory animals interacting with herds ofprey, and even the ``slow-mob'' behavior of social or political unitsin their response to legislative or judicial activities. Examples inthis present study emphasize battlefield encounters, with each groupcharacterizzed by its susceptibilities, skills, and other manifestionsof both intentional and accidental circumstances. Specifically, we investigatethe relative importance of leadership, camaraderie, training level (i.e.skill in firing weapons), bravery, excitability, and dedication in thebattle performance of personnel with random or specified distributionsof capabilities and susceptibilities in these various regards. The goalis to exhibit the probable outcome of these encounters in circumstancesinvolving specified battle goals and distributions of terrain impediments.A collateral goal is to provide a real-time hands-on battle simulatorinto which a leadership trainee can insert his own interactive command.</TEXT></DOC>
