 Before 1982 the onlyregular T-1 user was the federal government.andP;  It was simply too expensive foreveryone else.andM;Now there is competition in the marketplace -- among service providers andequipment manufacturers.andP;  Prices have come down and they keep on coming down.andO;Now T-1 can be cost effective in replacing as few as six analog lines.andP;  Andeven better, the market is expected to continue growing by leaps and bounds.andM;Yet for most of us, there is a very basic problem associated with thetechnology.andP;  You can't pick it up and you can't look at it -- so what in theworld is this T-1 stuff?andM;Simply stated, T-1 is a digital transmission link with a capacity of 1.544Mbps.andP;  It commonly operates over twisted-pair, fiber optic cable ormicrowave.andM;When used entirely for voice it handles 24 voice conversations (each 64Kbps), but that 1.544 Mbps of capacity can be allocated any way you want.andP;  Ifyou need a whole chunk of bandwidth for a video conference you can set asidelots of those bits to carry it.andM;Once upon a time &quot;T-1&quot; meant something very specific to The Phone Company.andO;It meant selected cable pairs and digital regenerators every 6,000 feet.andO;Over time T-1 has once to mean the DS-1 rate (1.544 Mbps) and not anyspecific cabling system or equipment.andM;How It WorksandM;First, the analog voice signal is digitized.andP;  Those familiar sinuous soundwaves are converted into the one/zero bits of a digital signal.andP;  Because ofthe way the conversion takes place each conversation is crisp and clear anduses 64 Kbps.andM;Then that signal is multiplexed.andP;  The T-1 transmission rate is faster than wecan talk or listen, so 24 voice conversations are chopped up, mixed together,transmitted together, then separated back into individual conversations attheir destination.andM;Because the transmission is digital it can be used for data as well as voice.andO;And because it's so fast it can be used for video, facsimile and CAD/CAMtransmissions.andM;BenefitsandM;Cost.andP;  The start-up costs for T-1 can be high, but the savings are so greatit's very possible to break even in the same fiscal year, says WilliamFlanagan in his indispensable Guide to T-1 Networking (available from theTelecom Library --1-800-LIBRARY).andM;He calculates (using January 1988 tariffs) that T-1 is less expensive than 24voice circuits for distances under 900 miles.andP;  When transmitting compressedvoice and data the savings are even greater (for distances over 1,000 milesT-1 is more expensive than the 24 voice lines.).andM;The Market Intelligence Research Company reports that T-1 is now costeffective to nearly any company using 10 or so phone or data circuits betweentwo points.andM;TELECONNECT recently noted that the break-even point can be as low as sixanalog lines.andP;  That means you can get 24 &quot;circuits&quot; for the price of six.andM;Network Control.andP;  T-1 is easy to expand once it's installed.andP;  It gives youthe ability to gather diagnostics and reroute traffic from a central point ofcontrol.andM;&quot;To add a line with T-1 you only neet to add a card on each end,&quot; says TomHornsby of Case/Datatel.andM;Diagnostic Control.andP;  T-1 is easier to monitor because you are consolidatingyour transmission into a single circuit.andP;  There is less stuff to monitor.andM;T-1 lends itself to a centralized &quot;war room&quot; which can monitor the wholenetwork.andP;  From your diagnostics you will have a good idea which vendor tocall if there is trouble.andP;  Because a T-1 network is dynamic, if somethinggoes wrong in one part of your network you can reroute traffic throughanother part.andM;Configuration Control.andP;  T-1 is flexible.andP;  You can allocate bandwidth at willor use extra bandwith to add channels instantly (The initial T-1 installationtakes about four months.).andM;You can experiment with different transmission speeds or routes withoutwaiting for the telco -- and, of course, there is no telco charge for yourchanges.andM;Simplication.andP;  T-1 gathers the scattered, messy &quot;spaghetti&quot; of voice and datalines between two points into a single high-speed digital circuit.andM;William Flanagan points out that a backbone with branches is easier tounderstand, diagnose and reconfigure than a mesh (or mess) of low-speedlines.andP;  T-1 is organized.andP;  It's easy on your brain.andP;  The simplication makesmanagement and monitoring easier.andM;Reliability.andP;  T-1's reliability hinges on two things:  the given reliabilityof a digital circuit and the redundancy that is or can be built into systemsby carriers and manufacturers.andM;With digital circuits transmission is usually an all or nothing thing.andO;Either they work great or they don't work at all.andM;Most carriers provide redundancy in the long-haul portion of their route andthe latest multiplexers and bandwitdth managers provide automatic alternaterouting, says Flanagan.andP;  In a private network automatic alternate routingre-establishes a downed path using other available circuits.andM;Quality.andP;  The quality of digital circuits for voice transmission islegendary.andP;  The nature of the digital signal (one or zero, no in between)means that noice can be easily removed from the signal instead of beingregenerated and even amplified along with the signal.andM;For data, that &quot;all or nothing&quot; statement seems to apply.andP;  You don't have towonder about quality -- the signal is either there and good or it's gone.andM;The speed of T-1 alone can improve quality of service.andP;  For example theresponse time between mainframes and terminal is much faster when a T-1circuit is used.andM;How It Is UsedandM;T-1 was originally used between central offices to save on cabling -- afterall it carries 2j voice conversations on just two twisted pairs.andM;These days it is still used between COs, but it is also used by companies tobypass the local loop or to gain access to the point-of-presence of a specialservice like WATS.andP;  It is used to replace multiple tie lines -- especially tocombine multiple voice and data lines into one package.andP;  And T-1 is used as abackbone in private and hybrid networks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
