(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>New technologies and applications require new skills.andP;  But where will theycome from? Veteran IS workers who don't retrain may be replaced by newtalent.andM;When Harvey Shrednick took over is at Corning Inc. five years ago with ordersto turn things around, he could have engineered a major house cleaning.andO;Shrednick was expected to improve efficiency and quality within the isdepartment.andP;  At the time, is had more than its share of veteran mainframeprogrammers and analysts and not nearly enough people skilled in importantemerging technologies such as personal computers and local area networks.andM;&quot;I came in, and I had a license to do what I had to do,&quot; recalls Shrednick,Corning's vice president of information services.andP;  &quot;The effort at that pointcould have been to bring in a lot of outside people and replace the people Ihad in order to get the skills I needed.&quot;andM;Shrednick decided instead to reorganize and retrain his 240-person is workforce, partly because trying to recruit a new, young staff to rural New Yorkstate would have been a challenge, and partly because he figured a sweepinghouse cleaning would have caused distraction and threatened his owncredibility.andM;Like Shrednick, many IS executives are under increasing pressure to overhauland update the skills of the people in their departments.andP;  And manyapparently are being forced to answer a difficult question: Should they takethe time and expense to retrain their existing is work force? Or would it bebetter to replace veteran mainframe-oriented programmers, analysts andproject managers with younger, often less expensive, workers coming out ofcollege with knowledge of new technologies like UNIX and the C language?andM;Certainly the question is not a new one.andP;  In the fast-moving world ofinformation systems and technology, it has always been a challenge forprogrammers, analysts and managers to keep their skills up to date.andP;  And isexecutives have always fretted over what to do about veteran is workers whohave fallen off the technology curve.andP;  In the past, those workers may havebeen shifted into software maintenance jobs or even kicked upstairs intomiddle management positions that justified their higher salaries.andM;But times have changed.andP;  Most IS executives are facing tighter budgets andpressure to downsize and flatten organizations.andP;  That means less room formiddle managers in is.andP;  It also means IS executives are unable to satisfytheir need for new is workers with new skills by creating new positions.andP;  Atthe same time, most IS executives are under pressure to bring new types ofapplications-med on new technologies such as Pc's, LANs and graphical userinterfaces-to users faster and more efficiently.andM;&quot;Many times, dramatic change becomes an important near-term goal,&quot; says johnHammitt, is vice president at United Technologies Corp. in Hartford, Conn.andM;A Desire for New BloodandM;While Hammitt and others say the best approach is usually to help current isworkers pick up those new skills through retraining, a significant number ofis executives seem to be  taking a different approach, one perhaps bestdescribed as, &quot;Out with the old and in with the new.&quot;andM;&quot;A lot of people are taking the approach that 'a new broom sweeps clean,'&quot;says Robert A. Zawacki a professor at the University of Colorado at ColoradoSprings and a long-time advocate of retraining for is workers.andP;  &quot;A lot ofpeople are saying, 'I simply don't have time to get these people retrained.andO;I don't have time to get these people up to speed.andP;  So I just go out and hirethose people I need with those skills.' But ...andP;  what kind of signal doesthat send the people who are still there?&quot;andM;It is not a signal that makes is workers happy.andP;  According to an update of a10-year-old study on is worker attitudes he recently completed, Zawacki saysjob dissatisfaction among programmers and analysts was higher in 1989 than in1979.andP;  A big part of the reason, says Zawacki, is the perception by isworkers that their companies are more willing to invest in expensive ishardware than in ongoing training for and communication with employees on theis front lines.andP;  &quot;We're losing the battle in how we manage our people,&quot; saysZawacki.andM;Judith Marx Golub sees herself as a victim of management's willingness toturn its back on experienced programmers in favor of new recruits and newtechnologies.andP;  A 26-year programming veteran, Golub says she and anotherhighly paid, experienced programmer were forced out of their jobs with a BayArea pharmaceuticals-manufacturing company, which she declines to identify.andO;She contends that her management didn't understand the work she was doing andit wanted to shift to new technologies and lower paid employees.andP;  Golub, nowworking independently as a consultant, had been spending most of her time atthe company maintaining payroll and human resources systems.andM;My managers were MBAs who didn't understand how much time maintenance takes,&quot;says Golub.andP;  &quot;They wanted us to go to new technologies like a 4GL[fourth-generation language], but I never used it because I had to spend mostof my time maintaining the existing systems.&quot; Finally, says Golub, sheresigned after her managers &quot;made my life miserable.&quot; She is now suing thecompany for mental abuse.andM;Things are tougher now because there's downsizing, and companies have to getrid of people,&quot; says Golub.andP;  &quot;Often, it's the experienced, more expensiveones that are the first to go.andP;  &quot; In fact, so many of Golub's veteranprogrammer friends have found themselves squeezed out of their jobs recentlythat they've come up with a name for their between jobs status: &quot;on thebeach.&quot;andM;Mike Walsh is another is veteran who finds himself on the beach these days.andO;After 23 years with a New York recording industry company, Walsh says, he wasfired from his job as IS director a year ago.andP;  His termination occurred soonafter the arrival of a new is chief with whom Walsh did not get along.andP;  Likemany longtime is workers, Walsh says he was vulnerable after moving into amiddle management role in which he never felt comfortable.andP;  His technicalskills eroded at the same time that his company's need for is middle managerssoftened.andP;  In the end, Walsh says, the company showed him the door ratherthan offering to retrain and relocate him.andM;&quot;I wish they' found something else for me.andP;  I didn't want to go,&quot; says Walsh,52, who now is struggling to make a go of an independent consulting businesswhile looking for a new job.andM;But it's  getting  harder and harder for veteran is workers with traditionalskills to find jobs.andP;  According to Fred Wisser, manager of is placement inthe San Francisco office of Robert Half of Northern California, programmerswith coBOL backgrounds and traditional glass house experience, &quot;are takinglonger to place and usually have to take a cut in pay.&quot; At the same time,people with 4GL, C or UNIX experience are in great demand, says Wisser,himself a 20-year is veteran before jumping into the job placement business.andM;Retrain or DieandM;Some is executives are asking their veteran workers to assume much of theresponsibility for keeping their skills in line with their employers'technology directions.andP;  At San Francisco-based Pacific Bell Co., for example,vice president for systems technology Jack Hancock recently sent his 4,800 isworkers a report detailing the types of is skills and experience the regionalBell operating company will want from employees in the future.andP;  The report,called &quot;Scan 2000,&quot; also spells out which skills will no longer be in greatdemand at PacBell in the future.andP;  Third-generation languages and hand codingof applications, for example, will give way to 4GLS and applicationsgenerators.andP;  COBOL will be superseded by C and UNIX.andP;  File-based skills willbe replaced by experience with relational database management systems.andP;  And,beyond technology, Hancock says, Pacbell is looking for workers who do morethan just sit at their desks waiting for someone to order up a request.andO;Instead he wants people to anticipate end-users' needs, or, as he puts it:&quot;order taking will be out, and a customer orientation will be in.&quot;andM;PacBell's is employees will do well to heed Hancock's message.andP;  In the lastcouple of years, the company has cut its is head count by 700 to 4,800.andP;  Andmore cuts are in store, says Hancock, as PacBell continues its efforts toturn itself from a telecommunications monopoly into a more competitive,efficient business.andP;  At the same time, Hancock has decided to continuecollege recruiting for new Is blood.andP;  &quot;If you don't, you don't have newthinking in the organization, and you end up with an age gap,&quot; he says.andM;The result at PacBell and many other companies is a numbers game that islikely to end with many more experienced is people hitting the beach.andP;  &quot;Themessage is,  Get retrained now,  &quot; says Hancock.andM;And many is workers are doing just that.andP;  Richard Dwinall, marketing vicepresident at Minneapolisbased Human Capital Corp., a technology-traininginstitute, says he is seeing more is professionals seeking to update theirskills under orders from their employers.andP;  &quot;A lot of them have been told togo out and get new skills, and that's what they're doing,&quot; says Dwinall.andO;Human Capital, which acquired the Institute for Advanced Technology andControl Data Institute from Control Data Corp. last year, has since set up 30sites around the country to accommodate these individuals.andM;One such individual is Ray Frazee, a senior programmer/analyst with AkzoChemicals Inc. of Chicago.andP;  Late last year, he helped his company migratefrom an IBM S/38 to an AS/400.andP;  Highly integrated environments such as theAS/400, he says, require is workers to become generalists rather than  focuson one isolated specialty like systems programming.andP;  That means,increasingly, he will have to interact with end users.andP;  Accordingly, the33-year-old Frazee has recently taken courses and worked on improving hiswriting and communications skills.andP;  &quot;The era when you could just sit in yourcubicle and write code is long gone,&quot; says Frazee.andP;  Whose Fault it is?andM;Many is executives acknowledge that they bear some of the responsibility forthe disparity between staff members' skills and organizational demands.andP;  &quot;Insome ways, it's our own fault,&quot; says Dan Cavanagh, is vice president atMetropolitan Life andamp; Affiliated Cos.andP;  &quot;We keep people on the same project foryears because that seems like the easy thing to do.andP;  Then we wonder why theirskills haven't kept up.&quot;andM;At the same time, many is executives have turned to consultants or systemsintegrators to get sexy new projects off the ground.andP;  That can lead toresentment among internal is workers at the lost opportunity to learn newskills, says Cavanagh.andM;Recently, moreover, several user organizations have gone one step further,outsourcing most, if not all, of their is operations to vendors such asComputer Sciences Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp. or IBM.andP;  &quot;That's oneway for companies to deal with managing, the human resource-just turn it overto us,&quot; says William Woodward, a vice president at csc and author of a recentDATAMATION article on how is professional! fall behind technically (see&quot;Learning To  Cure Technical Obsolescence,&quot; July 15, page 75.andP;  Frequently,the company's is staffers then become the employees of the outside firm.andM;Several user organizations are trying to do better by their veteran isworkers.andP;  Rather than replacing experienced people or farming them out tointegrators, these companies are budgeting significant resources forretraining and trying to improve the way is workers are hired, with an eyetoward bringing in people who can adapt to change andandM;&quot;I guess with us it's partly an ethical issue,&quot; says Ray Hass, a humanresources manager in the is department at Minnesota Mining and ManufacturingCo. (3M) in St. Paul.andP;  &quot;If you have someone who's worked for you for 15 or 20years, you have some responsibility to that person.andP;  Loyalty goes both ways,and it can't be purchased.andP;  It must be earned.&quot;andM;3M has formalized a system of parallel career paths for is workers.andP;  One is amanagement track; the other is for programmers and analysts who want toremain on the technical side of is.andP;  3M mandates that those workers completea minimum outside retraining and education program annually, and 3M picks upmuch of the tab.andP;  As a result, for several years 3M has enjoyed a lowturnover rate for is personnel-between 7 and 8% a year.andM;3M also has been a leader in developing sophisticated evaluation and hiringpractices specifically for is.andP;  Like a small but growing number of companies,3M, and its two-year-old is human resources department, has developed aprofile of characteristics for hiring.andP;  Developed in conjunction withProfessor Zawacki at the University of Colorado, the profile includes notonly technical skills but such characteristics as the ability to help others,the ability to work in a group and interests in extracurricular activitiesoutside work.andP;  Potential is workers who score well in those areas are likelyto be comfortable and effective in the new, service- and user-oriented rolesthey will be required to fill, Zawacki says.andP;  in With the New, On With theOldandM;Still other companies, after going outside for is workers with newtechnological swills, are asking those new people to help retrain existingprogrammers and analysts.andP;  Will Street brokerage firm Shearson Lehman Hutton,for example, looked mostly outside the company a couple of years ago whenfirst staffing a new group charged with developing client/server, unix-basedapplications for its capital markets businesses.andP;  More recently, however, the30-person group has been pulling in experienced mainframe programmers fromwithin the company.andP;  The idea, according to project infrastructure leaderDavid Sherr, is both to spread the new technology throughout the isorganization and also to introduce mainframe-class testing and documentationprocedures to UNIx-oriented programmers.andM;&quot;To float it, we brought in the skill set,&quot; says Sherr.andP;  &quot;But now what wewill do is gradually involve a lot of the mainframe people in areas oftesting and documentation.andP;  The idea-is there's a lot of knowledge in thesepeople.... There's a lot of lore in organizations, things that are neverwritten down.andP;  And you don't want to lose that or lose these people.&quot;andM;Such examples suggest that at least some organizations are taking a long-termapproach to helping veteran is workers avoid unplanned time on the beach.andO;Experts, however, say they are still the exception.andP;  Most is managers stillthink of money budgeted for staff retraining as discretionary spending, oneof the first items to go when cuts are in order, according to Robert Morison,a principal at the Index Group Inc. consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.andM;But IS executives who choose to focus on the time and expense it will take toretrain experienced is workers fail to consider that it will also take plentyof time before their replacements will adequately understand the businessthey are being hired to support, says Bill Curtis, a director at the Austin,Texasbased Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp'  (mcc) researchcenter.andM;&quot;IS executives seem to be willing to accept the limitations of people theyhire out of college far more readily than they accept the limitations ofpeople they already have on board,&quot; says Curtis.andM;is execs who favor retraining feel that such an approach is a losingstrategy, and one that will only become worse in the future.andP;  Demographictrends suggest that in a few years there will be an increasingly criticalshortage of all types of workers, including programmers and analysts.andP;  Whenthat reality hits home, companies that have developed advanced hiring andretraining programs figure they'll have a significant competitive advantage.andM;&quot;Retraining is the only viable strategy ,&quot;  says United Technologies'Hammitt.andP;  &quot; Replace continuing way of doing business has no redeeming valueother than whacking the organization in the head.andP;  If you want to getattention, it's certainly one way to do it.andP;  But it's not the way to buildlong-term capability and bench strength.andM;Skills and Attitudes in DemandandM;* Fourth-Generation and C LanguagesandM;* Personal Computer OrientationandM;* UNIXandM;* NetworkingandM;* Proactive Customer OrientationandM;* Desire To Work in GroupsandM;Skills and Attitudes in DeclineandM;* Mainframe OrientationandM;* COBOLandM;* Reactive Customer OrientationandM;* Desire To Work AloneandM;The Government's Looming Skills CrisisandM;The country's largest employer, the federal government, has identifiedretraining of information systems employees and other workers as a highpriority.andP;  In fact, a report issued by the U.S.andP;  Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) says that, because government service often pays less thanprivate industry and suffers from image problems, federal agencies will facea staffing crisis soon if they don't get serious about retraining.andM;The report, called Civil Service 2000 and prepared for the OPM by the HudsonInstitute of New York  says the federal government and individual agenciesmust decentralize recruitment and hiring, emphasize hiring women andminorities and concentrate on retraining the workers they already have,particularly in technical fields like is.andP;  &quot;Since few of these workers willbe hired from outside the government at much above entry level, it will benecessary for the government to invest heavily in the continuing development6-f the skills of those whom it retains,&quot; says the report.andP;  If agencies areto maintain an up-to-date skill base comparable with private industry (andthis skill base will be essential to deal adequately with contractors), thewill be forced to reinvest continuously in  their senior-level technical workforces.&quot;andM;The federal government faces the same demographic trends as private industry:a national work force that will grow at only about 1 % annually through theend of this decade, about one-third the rate seen as recently as the 1970s,the study reports.andP;  Add to that the government's lower pay scale-particularlyin high-cost urban areas-and federal agencies obviously have little choicebut to retrain.andM;The report says that the problem is particularly acute for agencies like theSocial Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, which areattempting to upgrade their information technology significantly.andP;  The reportsuggests that individual agencies take steps such as paying for employees'tuition, allowing educational sabbaticals or even underwriting multiyearadvanced training programs.andM;The OPM and other government agencies already have started taking thereport's recommendations to heart.andP;  According to senior policy analystMichael Carmichael, OPM and the Cabinet-level agencies have formed anInteragency Advisory Group of personnel directors to develop retrainingstrategies.andP;  OPM also has backed a federal government pay reform legislationpackage that would give agencies more flexibility.andP;  For one thing@  it wouldallow them to pay more for positions in high-cost areas  of the country.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
