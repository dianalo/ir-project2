This incorporation will necessitate amendmentsto several Parts of Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations.These amendments will consist of conforming changes and cross referencesin numerous FmHA loan making and loan servicing regulations. These changeswill be addressed in the final rule publication, but are not included inthis proposed rule since these changes are only administrative in nature.FmHA Instruction 1965-A has been amended to provide that the payment ofincome tax resulting from a capital gain from a cash sale is not authorized.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Mr.Neal Sox Johnson, Acting Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration,has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial numbered of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation</ITAG>1.

An adjustment is not a final settlement until all paymentsunder the adjustment agreement(s) have been made.(b) <T3>Cancellation. </T3>The final discharge of a debt without any paymenton it.(c) <T3>Chargeoff. </T3>The writing off of a debt and termination of collectionactivity without release of personal liability.(d) <T3>Compromise. </T3>The satisfaction of a debt or claim by the acceptanceof a lump-sum payment of less than the total amount owed on the date orclaim.(e) <T3>Debtor. </T3>The borrower of funds under any of the FmHA programs.This includes co-signors, guarantors and persons or entities that initiallyobtained or assumed a loan.(f) <T3>Farmer Program loans. </T3>Farm Ownership (FO), Operating (OL), Soiland Water (SW), Economic Emergency (EE), Emergency (EM), Recreation (RL),Special Livestock (SL), Softwood Timber (ST) loans, and/or Rural HousingLoans for farm services buildings (RHF).(g) <T3>Amount of debt. </T3>The outstanding balance of the amount loaned includingprincipal and interest plus any outstanding advances, including interest,made by the Government on behalf of the borrower.(h) <T3>Servicing office. </T3>The FmHA office that is responsible for theaccount.(i) <T3>Settlement. </T3>The compromise, adjustment, cancellation, or chargeoffof a debt owed to FmHA.

Accordingly, FmHApersonnel charged with any responsibility in connection with debt settlementwill adhere strictly to the authorizations, requirements, and limitationsin this subpart, and will not substitute individual feelings or sympathiesin connection with any settlement.(b) <T3>Collection efforts. </T3>When debtors are contacted in an effort tocollect, the employee in charge of the account will obtain from them essentialinformation concerning their financial condition. This should include whereapplicable, but not limited to, obtaining Form FmHA 1910-5, ``Request forVerification of Employment,'' debtors providing expense verification, verifyfarm program benefits (ASCS payments), and examining county records todetermine what other assets the debtor has or recently disposed of. Also,where a spouse is not a co-debtor the spouse's income will be consideredin determining family living expenses. If it appears that a debtor willnot be able to pay in full and the indebtedness is eligible for settlementunder this subpart, action should be taken, if possible, to avoid unnecessarylitigation to enforce collection. If the debt is eligible for settlement,the debt settlement authorities of FmHA should be explained and the privilegesthereof extended to the debtor. The information obtained from the debtorshould be documented on Form FmHA 1956-1, ``Application for Settlementof Indebtedness.''Settlement of claims against recipients of grant funds for reasons suchas the use of funds for improper purposes may also be considered underthis subpart.(c) <T3>Negotiating a settlement. </T3>District Directors and County Supervisorscannot approve debt settlement actions; therefore, they will make no statementsto a debtor concerning the action that may be taken upon a debtor's application.In negotiating a settlement, all of the factors which are pertinent todetermining ability to pay will be discussed to assist the debtor in arrivingat the proper type and terms of a settlement. The present and future repaymentability of a debtor, the factors mentioned in this subpart, and any otherpertinent information will be the basis of determining whether the debtshould be collected in full, compromised, adjusted, canceled, or chargedoff. It is impossible in cases eligible for debt settlement to forecastaccurately the debtor's future repayment ability over a long period oftime; consequently, the period of time during which payments on settlementoffers are to be made should not exceed five years. Debtors have the rightto make voluntary settlement offers in any amount should they elect todo so. Settlement offers will not be approved in any case unless thereis reasonable assurance that the debtor will be able to make the paymentsas they become due.(d) <T3>Disposition of property. </T3>Security may be retained by the debtoronly under the conditions specified in andSection; 1956.66 of this subpart.(e) <T3>Proceeds from the disposal of security prior to approval of a debtsettlement offer. </T3>A borrower is not required to have disposed of thesecurity prior to application for debt settlement for a loan to be settled.However, if a borrower has disposed of security prior to applying for debtsettlement, proceeds from the disposed security must first be applied onthe debtors account, irrespective of an application for debt settlementunless the conditions specified in andSection; 1956.66 of this subpart aremet.(f) <T3>County Committee review. </T3>The County Committee will review alldebt settlement actions for Farmer Programs debtors and recommend for approvalor rejection, except for the cancellation of those debts discharged inbankruptcy where there is no remaining security. The proposed debt settlementwill be reviewed for approval or rejection and no settlement shall be approvedif it is more favorable to the debtor than recommended by the County Committee,except as provided for in andSection; 1956.58(e) of this subpart. The CountyCommittee will not review proposed debt settlement action for Housing loans.(g) <T3>Settlement when legal or investigative action has been taken recommended,or is contemplated.  </T3>(1) Debts cannot be settled:  (i) If the matter has been referred either to the Office of the InspectorGeneral (OIG) under andSection; 1962.49(a) of Part 1962, Subpart A of thischapter or to OGC because of suspected criminal violation, or criminalprosecution is pending because of an illegal acts(s) committed by the debtorin connection with the debt or the security for that debt, the procedureoutlined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section will be followed, unless,the OIG has declined to investigate the matter or, OGC has advised otherwise,or, the case is in the hands of the United States Attorney.

(h) <T3>Advice from the OGC. </T3>State Directors will obtain, when necessary,advice from the OGC in handling proposed debt settlement actions whichinvolve legal problems.  (i) <T3>Settlement of claims against estates. </T3>Settlement of a claim againstan estate under the provisions of this subpart will be based on the recoverythat may reasonably be expected, taking into consideration such items asthe security, costs of administration, allowances of minor children andsurviving spouse, allowable funeral expenses, and dower and courtesy rights,and specific encumbrances on the property having priority over claims ofthe Government.  (j) <T3>Joint debtors. </T3>Settlements may not be approved for one joint debtorunless approved for all debtors. ``Joint debtors'' includes all parties(individuals, partnerships, joint operators, cooperatives, corporationsestates) who are legally liable for payment of the debt.

For example, ``John Doe, joint debtor with Bill Doe, deceased,'' ``JohnDoe, joint debtor with Sam Doe, discharged in bankruptcy,'' ``John Doe,joint debtor with Mary Doe, impossible or impracticable to obtain signature,''as appropriate. In addition to the information concerning settlement ofthe debt by the applicant, information which justifies settlement of thedebt as to the debtor(s) not joining in the application will be shown onForm FmHA 1956-1 or 1956-2 for (housing loans).

In such cases, thefacts will be fully documented in Part VIII of Form FmHA 1956-1. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1956.58</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approval or rejection.</ITAG>All debt settlement cases will be submitted for review in accordance withExhibit A of this subpart (available in any FmHA office).(a) <T3>Approval authority.</T3> Subject to this subpart, the compromise, adjustment,cancellation, or chargeoff of debts will be approved or rejected:(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, by the StateDirector when the outstanding balance of the indebtedness involved in thesettlement less the amount of a compromise or adjustment offer is lessthan $250,000 (including principal, interest, and other charges).(2) The State Director may approve the cancellation of debts dischargedin a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in accordance with andSection;1956.70(b)(3) ofthis subpart regardless of the amount of the outstanding indebtedness.(3) By the Administrator or designee when the outstanding balance of theindebtedness involved in the settlement less the amount of a compromiseor adjustment offer is $250,000 or more (including principal, interest,and other charges).(b) <T3>Approval processing.</T3> The State Director will:(1) Execute and send the original approved Form FmHA 1956-1 or Form FmHA1956-2 for housing to the Finance Office.(2) Notify debtors in writing of approval of the settlement of their indebtednessin the following cases:(i) All compromise and adjustment offers.

The costof collecting may be a substantial factor in settling small debts but normallywill not carry great weight in settling large debts.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1956.68 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Compromise or adjustment without debtor's signature.</ITAG>Debts of a living debtor may be compromised or adjusted if it is impossibleor impracticable to obtain a signed application and all other requirementsof this section applicable to compromise or adjustment with a signed applicationhave been met Form FmHA 1956-1 will show:(a) The sources from which the information was obtained.(b) That a current effort was made to obtain the debtor's signature andthe date(s) of such effort.(c) The specific reasons why it was impossible or impracticable to obtainthe signature of the debtor and, if the debtor refused to sign, the reason(s)given.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1956.69 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1956.70 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cancellation.</ITAG>Nonjudgment debts may be canceled in the following instances:(a) <T3>With application. </T3>The debt or any extension thereof on FarmerPrograms debts <T3>do not </T3>have to be due and payable under the terms of the noteor other instrument, or because of acceleration by written notice priorto the date of application.
