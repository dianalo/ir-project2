 After all, with conventional mass media -- Winchester hard-diskdrives or tape-backup systems -- data interchangeability is not an issue.andM;For write once/read many (WORM) optical disks, however, the situation is muchmore akin to a modern-day Tower of Babel.andP;  Not only is there littlepossibility, if any, of data exchange among drives from competingmanufacturers, but in many cases, no data exchange is possible betweendifferent models from a single vendor.andM;The lack of standards for WORM drives is a direct result of the slowacceptance of the products into the marketplace, said Ron Haglund, directorof quality assurance for the disk-products division of Toshiba AmericaInformation Systems Inc., of Irvine, Calif.andM;Haglund explained that standards committees simply took too long in trying toestablish a standard for 12-inch WORM drives, the first form factor offeredto the market.andP;  &quot;It takes so much time for a standards committee to puttogether a set of specifications that everyone can agree on, and they justgot started a little too late on the 12-inch drives,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;So by thetime there was some kind of resolution, no one really cared anymore.&quot;andM;The standards committee moved to the 5-1/4-inch drives, but again, theprocess was less than clear.andP;  There are now two lesser standards and onemajor standard for 5-1/4-inch WORM drives.andM;WORM Monogamy?andM;As a result of the multiple standards, corporate buyers face a situation inwhich buying a WORM drive is virtually a commitment to a single vendor.andM;&quot;That is why the standards committee is trying to establish a single standardfor the newer 3-1/2-inch form-factor drives,&quot; Haglund explained.andM;The 3-1/2-inch drives will be dual-function drives, capable of either WORM orerasable operation.andP;  Haglund said there will be no WORM-only 3-1/2-inchdrives, so the WORM market will probably never see a true standard for datainterchangeability.andM;Most experts agree with Haglund that the situation is unfortunate forcorporate buyers.andP;  &quot;There is no good answer to the standards problem, exceptthat the buyer really has to stay with a single company,&quot; said John D'Azzo,president of Interaction, a Clearwater, Fla., firm that sells WORM-basedsolutions to businesses.andM;According to D'Azzo, corporate buyers of WORM products should consider buyingfrom a company that can stand behind its hardware for years to come.andO;&quot;Obviously, the major players like Phillips and Panasonic will be there, butfor smaller companies, it is a wait-and-see situation,&quot; he said.andM;Oceanographer Gene Feldman, at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's (NASA's) Goddard Space Flight Center in Green Belt, Md.,andO;explained that he would have preferred a situation where datainterchangeability was possible with his WORM drives.andP;  He uses Sony Corp. ofAmerica WORM drives and jukeboxes to store massive amounts of satellite data.andM;Because Feldman wanted to be able to exchange data with other scientists, hewas frustrated by the lack of standards.andP;  There was no other storage mediumavailable, however, that provided the capacity and stability that WORMoffered.andM;Instead, because of the volume of data recorded on the WORM drives, Feldmansaid, NASA created its own standard for this particular type of data.andM;In some cases, however, the lack of standards has not been an impediment tocorporate buyers.andM;Lawrence Doe, a research-and-development analyst at truck maker Mack TrucksInc., of Allentown, Pa., uses WORM drives for an engineering application.andO;&quot;The only standard I was concerned with was being able to use the WORM drivesin a standard Unix configuration,&quot; said Doe.andM;If necessary, however, his company can manipulate the data files from itsSony WORM drive and translate the information into another format to exchangewith other systems, Doe said.andM;Don Bruss, senior systems-training technical specialist at parcel-deliveryfirm Federal Express Corp., of Memphis, Tenn., uses Sony WORM drives tosupport computer-based training stations.andP;  Although standards are not anissue at present, Bruss said, they may become problematic as the need toexchange data arises.andM;&quot;This is one of the cases where, when you are on the bleeding edge, therejust aren't any standards to adhere to,&quot; said Bruss.andP;  &quot;As the WORM industrygrows, I expect that the lack of easy data interchange will become a bigproblem.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
