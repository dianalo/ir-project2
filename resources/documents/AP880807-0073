There were varying estimatesof injuries.   Five complaints of alleged police brutality were filed as aresult of the melee over Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's EastVillage, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.   Some residents had asked that police close the park each nightbecause it is a hangout for drug users and dealers and rowdydrunks. Also, legions of homeless people and so-called punkrockers, who dress in black leather and spike their hair, use thepark at night.   Capt. Gerald McNamara, the neighborhood police commander, saidhe had orders from Mayor Edward I. Koch not to try again Sundaynight to close the park. Mayoral spokesman Larry Simonberg said theorder referred only to Sunday night and to as long as a heat wavecontinues.   Earlier Sunday, Detective Louis Llanes said officers were sentto close the park at midnight and people started blocking traffic.   ``Mounted police moved in to disperse and they were hit bybottles. They pulled back and police on foot were sent in,'' Llanessaid.   Then some fires were set. ``The Fire Department came toextinguish them and they were hit with rocks,'' Llanes said.   He estimated the disruption involved 750 demonstrators and 450police officers.   ``Police were calling people scum, twirling their nightsticks.And the kids were inciting them too, but they weren't throwingbottles or anything,'' said Dan Kelley, 26, who lives in theneighborhood.   At one point, a loud explosion of fireworks went off behind thepolice line.   ``At this very tense moment, police scattered,'' and somedemonstrators rushed back into the park, Kelley said.   ``Then police doubled back and came back. The crowd went nuts.Horses were charging in a sense and then bottles started flying.People started getting hit by billy clubs. I ran across the street.I was really afraid of getting trampled,'' he said.   ``An entire neighborhood was terrorized,'' added Sharon Breslau,who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years.``There was no time for `What? Where? Excuse me, what's your badgenumber?' It was a riot.''   Ms. Breslau, 30, watched the action from her house: ``There werehundreds of people running for their lives.''   She said the brigade of police ``came right up on the sidewalkand knocked people down with their horses.''   Ms. Breslau said she witnessed three or four officers knock oneman down and hit him with their billy clubs.   ``At that point, I lost my mind. I started screaming `Don't hitpeople. Don't hit people' as loud as I could. This happened fivefeet from me.''   It was the second such incident at Tompkins Square.   Early the previous Sunday, in response to residents' complaints,police went to the park after midnight and asked a rock band tostop playing.   ``They were responsive, but a small percentage of the spectatorsbecame agitated and began throwing bottles at police,'' Llanessaid. Four people were arrested and five officers injured in thatdisturbance, Llanes said.   All of the injuries this week also were ``basically minor,''said Capt. William Olsen of the Emergency Medical Service.   Olsen said 13 civilians and five police officers were injured.   The police department had slightly different figures. Llanessaid seven officers were injured and nine civilians.   A spokesman at Beth Israel Hospital, located near the park, said28 people walked in on their own seeking treatment.   O'Donnell said there had been nine arrests _ six of those onriot and assault charges, both felonies. The other arrests were fordisorderly conduct and other misdemeanors.   All city parks technically close at 1 a.m., said Gary Zarr,spokesman for the Parks Department, but curfews are activelyenforced at only two Manhattan parks, Washington Square andStuyvesant Park.   ``Some members of the community asked for the curfews becausethere was a lot of antisocial activity going on in those twoparks,'' Zarr said. ``Stuyvesant has a fence so the ParksDepartment could literally close the gates. But most parks howeverdon't have gates, so they are open passage areas where people canenter at night.''</TEXT></DOC>
