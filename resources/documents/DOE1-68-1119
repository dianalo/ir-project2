Particle-induced x-ray emission(PIXIE) is discussed with respect to X-ray production, thick-target PIXIE,a microbeam PIXIE system, sensitivity, and microbeam PIXIE applications.An explanation of nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) is given for NRA withcharged particle detection, NRA with neutron detection and NRA with gammadetection. The essentials of Rutherford back scattering (RBS) are given,along with the elastic recoil detection analysis, which has very closeconnections with RBS but was introduced much more recently. Finally acomparison of the microbeam's capability with those of its main competitorsis presented.</TEXT></DOC>
