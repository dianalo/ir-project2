Wolfe's animated adaptationof three short stories by Zora Neale Hurston, is a happyexception to the rule that a good read rarely makes a goodshow. In this case, the tales project their powerful blend ofpathos and charm both in print and on stage.   Hurston, the Florida-born, New York-educated writer, isadmired today as an astute chronicler of black life and blackspeech in the '30s and '40s. Scorned during her lifetime bymany blacks who considered her to be perpetuating low-lifestereotypes, she died in ignominy in 1960.</LP><TEXT>   If Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey sang the blues, Zora NealeHurston wrote them. &quot;Spunk's&quot; three tales slide up and downthe scale of emotion. Like a good blues number, they're aboutordinary folks and the ordinary tragedies that happen betweenmen and women. Although they're mostly in a minor key, theyhave frequent bursts of gleeful comedy.   The principal stories are &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;The GildedSix-Bits.&quot; The first is the brutal story of a pious,hard-working washerwoman trying to shed a no-count, runaroundhusband. The betrayal is reversed in the second story, and agentle husband must come to terms with his foolish wife'sindiscretion.   In between comes the merry &quot;Story in Harlem Slang,&quot; abouttwo young men strutting down Lenox Avenue. Both are pennilessand trying to put the make on a savvy domestic who just gotpaid. In what must be the ultimate compliment on a lady'sfigure, one of the dandies exclaims: &quot;Oooo-eee] The shape yougot on you] I bet the Coca-Cola Company's paying you a lotfor the patent.&quot;   Before the two would-be moochers get their comeuppance,they primp, preen and prance around stage to the rollickingtune of their own colorful slang, which is annotated in theprogram. One example: &quot;Beatin' up your gums&quot; is translated as&quot;talking to no purpose.&quot;   Part acted, part narrated and part sung, the three storiesare linked musically. A snappy guitar player and anexpressive blues singer frame the tales in song. They neverleave the stage, but circle round each story's four players,constantly commenting on the action and occasionally takingpart.   It's probably unfair to single out any member of the castsince all six are so good, but I can't resist mentioning one:Reggie Montgomery has a villainous charm as the abusivehusband in &quot;Sweat.&quot; His flashy smile and flirtatious tilt ofthe head are simultaneously beguiling and sinister. In&quot;Harlem Slang,&quot; he's the model coxcomb as he shows off hiszoot suit in a breezy gravity-defying strut.   ---   Hurston's Harlem is a far cry from that of &quot;Mama, I Wantto Sing -- Part II,&quot; the continuation of the story of DorisWinter, a Gospel singer turned pop star. In the sequel, basedloosely on the life of Doris Troy (who plays the motherhere), Doris (D'Atra Hicks) juggles the demands of marriageand motherhood as her singing career takes her round theworld. She finally decides she'd rather be on Lenox Avenuethan on the Ginza.   The plot, the dialogue and the acting are all pretty thin,but the spirited music happily makes up for what they lack.All the voices are strong and the church choir, played by theNew York Reach Ensemble, is a delight. When they unleashtheir voices, pure joy escapes. The choral celebration is ledby Charles Stewart, in &quot;real&quot; life an English teacher at aNewark, N.J., high school. As the lightfooted minister ofmusic, he shimmies and shakes his way through the Gospeltunes with an exuberance that matches that of the choir.   ---   You'd think the life of Supreme Court Justice William O.Douglas would make good theater. It's heartwarming: The poorson of a preacher from a small town in the Pacific Northwestbreaks into the Eastern Establishment and, as liberal gospelwould have it, becomes the ardent defender of free speech inthe highest court in the land. There's adventure too: Heclimbs the Himalayas and drives cross Persia. There's evenromance: He marries four women.   All these elements make their way into &quot;Mountain,&quot; DouglasScott's homage to the nation's longest-serving justice. Butit's all as untidy as one of Justice Douglas's famous sloppyopinions, and it's about as much fun as watching therecitation of a court brief. To indicate how platitudinousand dull the script is, suffice it to say that some ofDouglas's better lines carry a touch of legalese, as if theywere lifted from the justice's decisions.   Len Cariou makes a valiant effort as Douglas, who iswritten as a saint at every age -- from childhood throughdotage. The opening scene, which takes place just before hisdeath, finds him on the floor trying to crawl up a wall hemistakes for a mountain. &quot;I don't need your help. I'm doingit myself,&quot; he shouts. This is supposed to project Douglas'sindomitable individualism. Self-centeredness is more like it,however, and Douglas's pious whining -- about his wives, hisfellow justices, his presidents, his mountains -- isn'tenough to build a character an audience can care about. Evenwhen discussing some of his famous opinions -- on the rightto contraception or the unconstitutionality of interringJapanese-Americans during World War II -- he sounds morepetulant than judicial.   John C. Vennema and Heather Summerhayes, dressed in sobersuits, play all the &quot;memories,&quot; of which there are 25 or so,including Nixon, FDR, Louis Brandeis, Mom, Dad and the fourwives. The two change roles about every other minute, whichis terribly confusing. Is the guy in the suit Harry Truman orDouglas's neglected son? The best that can be said about thisguessing game is that it is at least a distraction from thesanctimonious hagiography of a singularly unlikable man.</TEXT></DOC>
