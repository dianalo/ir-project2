(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Oracle's RDBMSandM;IT'S NO EASY task for a successful company to remain on the leading edge.andO;The tendency is to ride out whatever it is that brought success in the firstplace.andM;So here we find Oracle--by far the leading relational database managementsystem (RDBMS) vendor.andP;  It's actually the world's third largest softwarevendor, and more successful than ever.andP;  Even the EEC (European EconomicCommunity) has recognized Oracle and chosen it as its standard RDBMS--quite acoup.andM;The company prides itself on the fact that its RDBMS was ahead of its time.andO;Introduced in 1979, it was the first commercial RDBMS and the firstcommercial DBMS product to use SQL.andP;  The second RDBMS, Ingres, and the nextSQL-based contender, IBM's SQL/DS, didn't hit the market for another twoyears.andP;  SQL compatibility catalyzed Oracle's success to a certain point, andit continues to be uppermost in Oracle's vision of the future.andM;Oracle once led the RDBMS pack in terms of both sales and technologicalenhancements.andP;  Although it still retains its sales lead by a wide margin, wehave seen advancements in technology come from other vendors over the pastfew years.andP;  Meanwhile, Oracle clings to SQL compatibility.andP;  While this isn'tnecessarily bad, it has slowed Oracle's migration to the next-generation ofRDBMS functionality.andP;  We originally reviewed Oracle two years ago (OracleVersion 5.1 in 1987--see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  10), and we expected more enhancementsby now.andM;In the following pages, we provide a clear picture of the product line Oracleoffers.andP;  We examine both Oracle's overall architecture and strategy as wellas its specific products.andM;BackgroundandM;Oracle Corporation was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, president, and BobMiner, senior vice president.andP;  The Oracle RDBMS was originally developed andintroduced on a Digital PDP/11 under RSX11 and then rewritten in C and portedto the VAX/VMS environment.andP;  And Digital's success certainly proved to be anadvantage for Oracle.andM;In recent years, though, the company has made a dramatic commitment to Unix.andO;Most of Oracle's internal MIS development is under Unix (everyone on thedevelopment staff has a workstation connected via Ethernet to a Sequent backend), and now even some new products are released under Unix before they comeout on other platforms.andM;STAFFING AND FINANCIALS.andP;  Oracle went public in May 1986.andP;  The company hasdoubled its sales for the past four years in a row--an impressive showing.andO;Specifically, revenue for fiscal 1989 increased 107 percent to $584 million,while net income grew 90 percent to $82 million.andM;Oracle's staff is soaring, too.andP;  The company employs 5,500 peopleworldwide--that's up from a staff of only 200 five years ago, which is aphenomenal growth rate.andP;  You'd think Oracle would have trouble managing suchgrowth, but, so far, it seems to be doing just fine.andM;PRODUCT POSITIONING.andP;  Oracle's product and marketing philosophy is based onthree major principles: compatibility, portability, connectivity.andP;  These havebeen the building blocks for product development, and Oracle feels that ithas made considerable improvements in one or more of these areas every year.andO;(Generally, the company has a major release every year.)andM;Compatibility.andP;  SQL compatibility is the most basic tenet of Oracle'sstrategy.andP;  The company is committed to both ANSI and ISO standards.andP;  Oracle'simplementation of SQL is compatible with and extends IBM's implementation inSQL/DS and DB2.andP;  In addition, Oracle is committed to maintaining fullcompatibility with DB2 application.andM;Portability.andP;  Oracle runs on a wide variety of hardware and operating systemplatforms--over 100 Unix variations, PCs, and most proprietary systems.andP;  Thecompany recognized early on that its major customers--primarily Fortune 500companies--had heterogeneous systems resulting in incompatibility at thehardware, operating system, and application levels.andP;  Too much time and moneywas spent moving applications between systems; thus, portability became astrategy for Oracle.andM;Connectivity.andP;  Connectivity has been a development priority since theintroduction of SQL*Net in 1986.andP;  Oracle can connect different operatingenvironments, from PCs to minis to mainframes, and it can provide portableapplications across all of them.andP;  In addition, Oracle's distributed databaseand client/server architectures were developed out of a commitment toconnectivity.andP;  Stan Tims, director of Unix marketing, also points to Oracle's&quot;zillions&quot; of protocols and gateways (well, not quite zillions--see &quot;SQL*Net&quot;below).andM;MARKETING STRATEGY.andP;  Oracle targets the Fortune 500, and it has built itsproducts with these customers in mind.andP;  These are the companies mostconcerned with adherence to standards, and Oracle has been incrediblysuccessful in selling its SQL-based RDBMS.andP;  Oracle is also riding Big Blue'scoattails with DB2 compatibility.andM;While Oracle introduced distributed processing with SQL*Net in 1986, thecompany is now focusing on two marketing thrusts: online transactionprocessing (OLTP) and end-user computing (i.e., the interface, integration,and consistency among modules).andP;  It has also plugged into consulting andapplications development.andP;  Oracle racked up $50 million in consultingrevenues in 1989, up from nothing four years ago.andP;  The company seesconsulting as particularly important to its major customers--big companieswith large IBM and Digital systems.andP;  Its consulting group is now 600 strong.andM;The Competition.andP;  Because Oracle's revenues are more than triple those of itsnearest competitor (Ingres), it has a substantially larger Randamp;D budget(somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of its revenues).andP;  In the past, thatbudget was evident in enhancements made to the Oracle RDBMS.andP;  More recently,however, Oracle has been diversifying itself, and some of the importantadvancements in performance are coming from competitors (especially Ingresand Sybase).andP;  Tims maintains that competitors are &quot;ratifying what [Oracle]has done all along.&quot;andP;  (He points, as an example, to the Informix Stararchitecture as an answer to Oracle's SQL*Star architecture.)andP;  But lately, wesee just the opposite happening.andP;  To wit: Oracle's recent adoption of amultithreaded server and online backup and recovery came after people startednoticing those features in Sybase.andP;  In some stages of the race, Oracle hasfallen behind.andP;  For instance, it doesn't yet have fully implementedreferential integrity.andP;  And Oracle could learn a trick or two from Ingres'srecently announced &quot;intelligent&quot; server (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  12, December1989).andM;The Unix Market.andP;  In the past few years, Oracle has really sat up and takennotice of the Unix market.andP;  Tims maintains that Oracle's commitment to Unixthree years ago was next to nothing, but today, Unix is a strategic operatingenvironment.andM;Revenues from Unix sales are now over $165 million, up from only $1 to $2million a few years ago.andP;  Unix revenues break down as follows:andM;* Direct sales (end users) 70-75 percentandM;* OEMs 15-20 percentandM;* VARs 5-10 percentandM;Product LineandM;Oracle is an SQL-based RDBMS plus a set of integrated software tools forusers and application developers.andP;  Applications development tools includeforms generation and interfaces to most major programming languages.andP;  Oracleoffers a Lotus-like spreadsheet and, most recently, integrated electronicmail and a graphics system that runs on bit-mapped screens.andP;  And, much to thechagrin of some of its VARs, Oracle has recently plunged into theapplications market (see &quot;Applications&quot; below).andP;  The database kernel andtools are each licensed separately.andP;  Thus, customers can mix and match.andM;CORE PRODUCTS.andP;  The Oracle RDBMS, the back-end database management kernel, isthe core of the Oracle product line.andP;  The latest release is Version 6, whichcame out in 1988, and it offers an optional OLTP package.andP;  (Yes, optional;you have to pay for the extra performance.)andP;  New modules bundled with Version6 are SQL*DBA, a database administration utility that includes diagnosticmonitoring, an archive log, and recovery functions; and SQL*Loader, animproved loading utility.andM;The RDBMS has integrated core products as well.andP;  SQL*Plus provides acommand-driven interface to the RDBMS for creating and maintaining thedatabase and for ad hoc queries and reports.andP;  SQL*Forms is a forms-generationtool which features application triggers.andP;  Both SQL*Plus and SQL*Forms havebeen available in one form or another since Oracle was first introduced.andM;Host Language Hooks.andP;  Oracle supports two levels of interface withtraditional third-generation programming languages (3GLs): Precompilers(Pro*C, Pro*Cobol, etc.), which allow embedded SQL in programs written in C,Cobol (in various forms), Fortran, PL/1, Pascal, and Ada; and a predefinedset of subroutine calls (Pro*SQL) as a host-language interface that can beused with any programming language.andP;  Pro*SQL provides lower level calls toaccess data in an Oracle database directly, rather than through SQL.andM;DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.andP;  In addition to SQL*Forms and SQL*Plus, Oracle offersapplications developers SQL*Menu and CASE tools.andP;  SQL*Menu lets you createcustomized menu interfaces for applications.andP;  The CASE tools (Dictionary,Design, and Generator) let you design an application from scratch--agraphical &quot;fill in the form&quot; approach to describing and generating anapplication.andP;  However, CASE tools are not widely available under Unix.andP;  (SeeIllustration 5.)andM;END-USER TOOLS.andP;  Several modules have been designed for the end user.andP;  Theseinclude: SQL*Calc, a spreadsheet; SQL*Graph, business graphics; OracleGraphics, a high-end graphics package; SQL*QMX, a query manager and reportingtool; and Oracle Mail.andM;SQL*Calc.andP;  SQL*Calc is a Lotus-like spreadsheet with the ability to embed SQLstatements in cells.andP;  With SQL, the user can extract data from an Oracledatabase and enter it into a range of cells on the spreadsheet.andP;  The SQLstatement can refer to another cell on the spreadsheet, enabling the user tochange the value of variables and extract a different set of data from thedatabase.andP;  The user can also create tables and enter data into tables fromthe spreadsheet.andM;Oracle*Graphics.andP;  Oracle also has an optional business graphics packagecalled SQL*Graph.andP;  However, the company is downplaying SQL*Graph in deferenceto the newer, slicker Oracle*Graphics.andM;Oracle*Graphics is a chart and graph generator as well as a graphic designtool.andP;  It supports not only Oracle data, but DB2 and SQL/DS databases, anddata imported from spreadsheets (Lotus, Excel, and dBase).andP;  With it, you cancreate and edit (e.g., customize, resize, rotate, group, layer, etc.) chartsand graphics.andP;  The context-sensitive, hypertext-like Help implementationguides you smoothly around the system.andP;  Oracle*Graphics uses pull-down menus,dialog boxes, and artists' palettes via a mouse.andP;  You can also use commandkeys, once you've developed some expertise with the system.andP;  However, menusdon't include corresponding command keys (so developing that expertise mighttake a while).andP;  They should.andM;Oracle*Graphics only runs on Sun computers under Unix thus far.andP;  Ports toHewlett-Packard (HP) and Sequent machines are scheduled for midyear.andM;SQL*QMX.andP;  Oracle recently developed a dynamic query manager and reportingtool called SQL*QMX.andP;  Essentially, SQL*QMX simplifies querying for noviceusers by providing Query-by-Example (QBE).andP;  It's similar to (and compatiblewith) IBM's Query Management Facility (QMF).andP;  Users indicate which columnsthey want displayed or sorted within the pictorial representation of a table.andO;They can retrieve data on specified conditions, as well as insert, update,delete rows, and even perform table joins.andP;  Furthermore, users can convertQBE queries into SQL statements via a command within SQL*QMX.andP;  Oraclemaintains that, in time, frequent SQL*QMX users will recognize and understandSQL syntax, so it's almost a learning vehicle.andM;SQL*QMX is limited under Unix, currently running on certain Sequent, HP, andATandamp;T products in addition to VAX/VMS, VM, MVS, DOS, and AOS/VS.andP;  AdditionalUnix ports are on the agenda.andM;Oracle*Mail.andP;  Oracle's mail system, which is built on top of SQL*Star, isimplemented well.andP;  Oracle*Mail is consistent and portable among differenthardware platforms and operating systems.andP;  Communications among heterogeneoussystems are transparent; a Unix user can send a message to a user in an MVSenvironment and be completely oblivious of user locations, operating systems,or networks.andP;  In addition, Oracle*Mail interfaces to Unix and VMS mail viastandard communications gateways (e.g., X.400).andM;Oracle*Mail's interface is straightforward.andP;  Pull-down menus guide youthrough all the mail functions.andP;  A nice feature is that messages arecustomizable.andP;  If, for instance, you're sending a phone message, you choose&quot;phone message&quot; from a menu, and the system automatically configures themessage accordingly.andP;  Oracle*Mail also has some extra productivity andflexibility features.andP;  You can organize and cross reference your mail intovarious folders.andP;  You can also integrate applications; forms, reports, batchprograms can be exchanged electronically.andP;  A sales tracking application, forexample, can automatically notify key managers if sales fall below forecast.andO;Or routine reports can be automatically distributed to a designated mailinglist.andP;  This is the beginnings of procedural automation.andM;Applications.andP;  We mentioned that Oracle is branching into applicationsoftware, particularly financial applications and manufacturing automation.andO;The advantage of Oracle applications is that they are modular, flexiblesystems built on a relational database.andP;  The interface is consistent acrossall modules, and modules are designed to integrate with each other and withexisting applications.andP;  Modules can also be customized to meet specific needsof users.andP;  The Oracle Financials family of products includes Receivables,Revenue Accounting, General Ledger, Payables, Purchasing, and Assets.andP;  OracleCore Manufacturing is a material control and tracking system for parts,supplies, tools, resources, etc.andP;  It includes Inventory, Bill of Materials,Work in Process, Master Schedule, and MRP.andM;In its quest for application software, Oracle has been competing with--and infact losing--some of its VARs.andP;  The company maintains that VARs are stillcrucial to its marketing strategy.andP;  It's just that Oracle has shifted itspartnering focus to companies like Quadratron and Uniplex--office systemsvendors.andP;  Meanwhile, manufacturing and financial software vendors are pickingup other RDBMS companies.andP;  It's a trade-off.andP;  Application development islucrative, but it cuts off a marketing avenue.andP;  Obviously, Oracle believes ithas made the right choice.andM;ArchitectureandM;Version 6 was adjusted architecturally to facilitate transaction processing.andO;All the same, its previous client/server architecture, which separates theprocessing of its DBMS into a front-end user process and a back-end kernelprocess, was well-suited for the adjustment, so that stayed intact.andP;  Thearchitecture has a number of features worth mentioning:andM;* An array interface, which reduces the number of system calls, thus makingdata transfer faster and more efficient.andP;  The system sends a package ofsystem calls (the number in the package is predetermined by the systemsadministrator) rather than one at a time.andM;* Shared memory, which also improves performance.andP;  Rather than moving dataaround in the system from process to process, the processes exchangesemaphores (messages) identifying where the data is in memory.andP;  When a userissues a request for data, Oracle first checks in shared memory to see if thedata is already there.andP;  If so, Oracle need not access the disk.andP;  In addition,users share a single image of the database kernel, instead of storing aduplicate copy in memory for each user.andM;* Write-through cache, which helps in data integrity, though it is by nomeans a complete solution.andP;  Write-through caching flags changed (committed)data in the Unix buffer cache and forces the data to be written to the diskimmediately.andP;  While this actually slows performance down a little, thecompany considers it an absolute requirement for data integrity.andM;DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE.andP;  Oracle's client/server architecture is alsowell-suited to its distributed environment.andP;  We are disappointed, however,that Oracle's distributed database scheme hasn't changed much.andP;  While it hasadded features for fault tolerance and performance, the company hasstubbornly avoided the implementation of server-side referential integrity,reasoning that doing so goes against its commitment to ANSI standards.andP;  Thatmay be true, but Sybase and Ingres have implemented very workable solutionsnonetheless.andP;  Centralized data validity is essential for mission-critical,online, transaction-oriented distributed environments.andP;  It's simply toodifficult to control what version of an application runs on a workstation andto ensure that every developer has implemented data protection rulescorrectly.andP;  Oracle promises database-enforced integrity for Release 7, whichis scheduled for release later this year.andM;Oracle is also missing the ability to update multiple databases in a singletransaction.andP;  Most RDBMSs handle transaction management with a two-phasecommit.andP;  It works like this: The node controlling the transaction instructseach remote node on the operation it is to perform.andP;  As each participatingnode is ready to commit, it sends a message to the originating node.andP;  Onceall nodes have given their assents, the originating node sends out messagesto commit the transaction.andP;  If any node fails, the transaction is rolledback.andM;When last we looked at Oracle (Version 5.1), we were told that a distributedtransaction management implementation would be forthcoming in Release 6.andO;It's now slated for Release 7.andP;  Likewise, Oracle hasn't yet implementedpartitioned database tables, in which the rows of a single table can bedistributed across different nodes.andP;  Oracle is behind here; many considerpartitioned tables a first step in the implementation of distributeddatabases.andM;SQL*Star.andP;  SQL*Star is Oracle's distributed environment.andP;  It provides twomajor characteristics: location transparency and the ability to accessmultiple databases on different machines in a single query (i.e., joins andunions across network nodes).andM;SQL*Star comprises two products: SQL*Net and SQL*Connect.andM;* SQL*Net, Oracle's basis for distributed processing, lets applicationsaccess remote Oracle databases.andP;  SQL*Net protocols support several differentnetworks: DECnet, TCP/IP, async, and 3270.andP;  New protocols under Unix includesupport for LU6.2, synchronous, and Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP).andM;* SQL*Connect, which has been added since Version 5.1, is Oracle's gateway tonon-Oracle databases.andP;  Users can log onto a non-Oracle database running on aremote host and issue read-only SQL commands against the foreign database.andO;SQL*Connect supports access to Digital's RMS and IBM's two SQL-based DBMSs,DB2 and SQL/DS.andP;  Subsequent releases of SQL*Connect will feature access tonon-SQL-based datafiles such as IMS and VSAM.andM;More Interoperability?andP;  While SQL*Connect makes some headway intointeroperability, we put on our user's hat and asked why Oracle doesn'tsupport access to other major Unix RDBMSs.andP;  The company doesn't see this asbeing an appropriate move.andP;  But its customers (and potential customers) do.andO;After all, user organizations typically have a mishmash of hardware andsoftware.andP;  They want to be able to mix and match various databases.andP;  Oracleisn't alone in its stance on this issue.andP;  But we think it's time for softwarecompanies to stop tree-hugging and give users what they need: moreinteroperability.andM;The newly-formed SQL Access Group may offer some solutions here.andP;  The group'sgoal is to define a set of specifications based on the existing SQL standardso that one vendor's SQL application can access other vendors' SQL-based DBMSservers.andP;  (See News Analysis, page 21.)andM;Server Strategy.andP;  As an answer to the demand for multivendor hardwaresupport, Oracle has developed three server options: Unix 386, OS/2, andBanyan VINES.andP;  These allow PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix boxes to act as frontends on a distributed Oracle network.andP;  Oracle must be installed on each userworkstation on the LAN to access the database server.andP;  You connect to theservers using standard connectivity software (e.g., LU6.2, TCP/IP, async, and3270).andP;  With the Unix server, the LAN options are Novell NetWare and 3Com3+Open.andM;In addition to the servers, Oracle has developed add-ons for popular PC andMacintosh applications, including dBase, Lotus, and HyperCard, which let youaccess Oracle from within the application.andM;TRANSACTION PROCESSING OPTION.andP;  OLTP functionality was introduced withVersion 6.andP;  Other vendors offer OLTP functionality with their core products.andO;Of course, Oracle has always sold its products in pieces, but transactionprocessing is quickly becoming essential to distributed database schemes.andO;The company should rethink its position here, and stop making customers payextra for fundamental technology.andM;Oracle has zeroed in on what it sees as two trends in the relational databasemarket: the need for OLTP, complete with high performance and fault tolerancewith relational productivity; and the need for enterprise-wide computing,where users have instant access to information on distributed mainframes,minis, and PCs.andP;  In other words, Oracle is seeking to provide OLTP in thecontext of enterprise-wide computing.andP;  To that end, Oracle developed a newOLTP architecture.andM;A new programming language, PL/SQL, is also available with the transactionprocessing option.andP;  PL/SQL isn't quite a 4GL; Oracle prefers to call it atransaction processing language or a procedural language extension to SQL.andO;Used in conjunction with SQL*Forms, it allows an application to packagemultiple transactions, send the package for processing, and receive back theappropriate rows of data.andM;Multiprocessing.andP;  Oracle developed a client/multiserver model formultiprocessing (see Illustration 2).andP;  Theoretically, if there are enoughprocessors to go around, each user would get a CPU to bash against.andP;  All ofthe processors would access shared memory, cached tables, and programs.andP;  Thearchitecture delivers scalability by providing incremental throughput as youadd CPUs.andP;  Version 6 is also multithreaded, allowing multiple requests perserver simultaneously.andP;  The multiserver architecture also features dynamicadjustments--servers can be dropped or added as system loads change, therebyimproving throughput.andM;Row-Level Locking.andP;  Oracle implemented a row-level locking mechanism thatincreases multiuser performance.andP;  In essence, the DBMS locks a single rowinstead of an entire block of memory.andP;  It's an issue of granularity; moreusers can access data.andP;  You can retrieve, update, and delete data from aspecific row in a table, leaving other parts of the table open for updates.andO;You only have to wait if you're attempting to update a row that another useris currently updating.andM;For read consistency, Oracle has a &quot;snapshot model,&quot; which allows query toread rows without locks.andP;  As a row is being updated, the database records apre-update snapshot of the row in the roll-back segment of memory.andP;  A userquerying the database will see that snapshot, and thus will see the properinformation.andP;  This snapshot model enforces the following conditions.andM;* Queries do not block queries.andM;* Queries do not block updates.andM;* Updates do not block queries.andM;Oracle also talks about &quot;piggy-backed&quot; writes, a feature that also helpsperformance.andP;  If the database is hit with multiple transactions, it processesall of them together, rather than serving each in turn.andM;Redo Logging.andP;  With Version6, Oracle implemented an online database backup.andO;Oracle uses a redo log file to guarantee that committed transactions remainpermanent.andP;  Each transaction is recorded in the log file, and the transactionis not committed until the changes have been written to it.andM;If the system fails, Oracle can roll forward and roll back transactions.andP;  Thedatabase is recovered using the online redo log files.andP;  An archive processcopies full redo log files to tape.andP;  These archived logs contain a completehistory of all the changes made since the last backup.andM;The redo log writer is also responsible for writing multiple transactions sothey can commit simultaneously.andM;Using OracleandM;We evaluated Oracle Version 6.0 on an NCR Tower 32 under Unix System V.andO;Version 6 requires approximately .5MB of memory per user (it varies accordingto which modules you have in place), 5 to 15MB of disk storage space, andsupport for shared memory.andM;USER INTERFACE.andP;  Evaluating Oracle's current user interface situation wasdifficult.andP;  It's actually a user interface in transition.andP;  As yet, no&quot;umbrella&quot; menu exists that encompasses all the Oracle modules.andP;  Each moduleis invoked separately from the Unix prompt.andP;  Your username and password arerequired each time you call an Oracle module.andP;  (Your Oracle login can be madepart of your Unix login to avoid this problem.)andM;Oracle is in the process of integrating its products with a cohesive,consistent user interface across all components.andP;  However, it seems to beslow going.andP;  Oracle was in the same process when we reviewed it two yearsago.andM;In the past, Oracle has pushed Easy*SQL as a menu-driven user interface, butEasy*SQL is being phased out (it's available only on demand with Version 6)and a more graphical-oriented interface will be phased in.andP;  Oracle hasdesigned its own portable graphical user interface layer--internally calledOraKit--that is slowly being moved to all of Oracle's products.andP;  It willprovide users with the same look and feel across its entire product line.andO;Some components have it already--Oracle*Mail, Oracle*Graphics, SQL*QMX,SQL*Menu, SQL*ReportWriter, SQL*Forms BMI, and Oracle's CASE, financial, andmanufacturing products.andP;  The owrd from Oracle is that any new product willsport this interface, and remaining products will eventually adopt it.andP;  Intime, Oracle plans to support Motif, Open Look, and Presentation Managerinterfaces.andP;  (In other words, an Oracle application will automatically beportable to any of these interfaces.)andP;  SQL*Forms will be one of the firstproducts to be released with the Motif interface (time frame: midyear).andO;Meanwhile, Oracle is pushing SQL*Menu as a means to create a custom menuenvironment for the user.andM;Help.andP;  Oracle's Help function is also in a state of disarry and varies fromproduct to product.andP;  A new context-sensitive, windowed Help is available forsome tools (i.e., it's part of the new interface), while others still sufferfrom mediocrity.andM;Drawbacks of the current Help function:andM;* You can't scroll freely through Help text.andM;* You can only access Help on one topic at a time.andM;* SQL*Forms has no Help function at all--only a screen of function keys, butthat's not Help.andP;  (And, on our system, a keyboard-mapping problem got usstuck in a field.andP;  However, a new interface is due for SQL*Forms inFebruary.)andM;* Error messages are sometimes vague.andP;  For example, if you enter a duplicatevalue in a field where the value must be unique, you are told, &quot;Oracle erroroccurred while trying to update record.&quot;andP;  That could mean a lot of things; weprefer something more precise.andM;SQL*Plus.andP;  SQL*Plus is still the primary interface to the Oracle RDBMS on theUnix system.andP;  This interactive, command-driven interface is the only way tocreate and modify tables, create indexes, grant access permissions to thedatabase, etc.andP;  SQL*Plus consists of SQL commands and extensions toSQL--fittingly called SQL*Plus commands--for formatting results, settingoptions, and editing and saving command files.andM;Commands are entered at the SQLandgt; prompt, and current commands are stored in abuffer for editing (either with a rudimentary line editor or the Unix systemeditor).andM;There is a degree of inconsistency between SQL commands and SQL*Pluscommands.andP;  For example, in our last review of Oracle, we found it annoyingthat SQL*Plus commands were not automatically stored in the buffer.andP;  This isstill the case.andP;  If you make a mistake, you cannot just edit the commands;you have to reenter the entire command.andP;  In addition, whereas SQL commandscan span multiple lines, SQL*Plus commands are limited to single lines.andO;Another loose end (which may only exist in the NCR port) is that sometable/view names demand uppercase to run a query, even though thedocumentation states that object names are case insensitive.andM;Although SQL*Plus is command driven, we found it rlatively easy to learn anduse.andP;  Developers wouldn't have a problem with it.andP;  One nitpicky complaint isthat, if you misspell the first word of a command (e.g., enter &quot;selct&quot;instead of &quot;select&quot;) and try to execute it, Oracle rebuffs you with an errormessage: &quot;unknown command 'selct'--rest of line ignored&quot;.andP;  Then it's gone.andO;The command doesn't stay in the buffer for editing; you must reenter it.andO;Oracle explained that, if the first word of the command is misspelled, thesystem doesn't recognize that it's SQL, so it trashes the statement.andO;However, it can be annoying after you've just typed in a long, multilinedcommand.andM;SQL*Menu.andP;  Oracle is promoting SQL*Menu as an integrated front end to otherRDBMS tools.andP;  SQL*Menu is Oracle's fourth-generation menu developmentcomponent.andP;  It's made up of six objects: applications, menus, menu items,substitution parameters, procedures, and variables.andP;  (These days, it's alwaysa good idea to find out what people mean by &quot;object.&quot;andP;  In this case, Oraclerefers to a type of data in the database that you can copy, move, or deleteas one entity in a single operation.andP;  An object can contain--or be containedby--other objects.)andM;SQL*Menu can be linked with SQL*Forms and SQL*Plus to make an integratedpackage.andP;  In doing so, you can invoke either a form or report from withinSQL*Menu by calling SQL*Forms or SQL*Plus as subroutines.andP;  In addition,SQL*Menu preserves any SQL*Forms global variables, which, in essence, meansthat applications built by using SQL*Forms will be able to use SQL*Menu as afront end.andP;  Oracle recently added a menu macro command into SQL*Menu, so thatdesigners can reduce to a minimum the number of menus that a user must wadethrough.andM;Documentation.andP;  We like the Oracle documentation.andP;  The manuals are wellwritten, well illustrated (with nice, multicolor screen shots), clear,straightforward, and easily understood by a new user.andP;  Every now and again,they're even entertaining; some of these writers have s sense of humor.andM;The documentation comes in the form of separate booklets.andP;  Each module has atleast one and possibly up to three or more of these--for example, SQL*Formshas a Designer's Tutorial, a Designer's Reference, and an Operator's Guide.andO;In addition, each module has a quick reference card.andP;  If the documentationcame bound in plastic rings or were three-hole-punched so they would lay flatwhile you were keyboarding, they'd be perfect.andM;DATABASE DESIGN.andP;  Oracle has a single-database design.andP;  Tables are not storedas individual files, but rather as part of one database.andP;  Thus, there is noconcept of creating separate databases for different applications ne.g., acustomer database, an inventory database, an employee database), and you neednot create a database in Oracle before you can create tables.andP;  When Oracle isinstalled, a standard database file is created called oracle.dbs.andP;  When youcreate tables, they are all part of this database.andM;The advantage of a single-database design is speed; you by-pass the Unix filemanager.andP;  The disadvantages involve recovery and flexibility; you need torecover the whole database even if only part of it becomes corrupted.andP;  Toalleviate this disadvanatage, you can create additional databases.andP;  Oraclealso offers &quot;table spaces&quot; as a way to segment the database.andP;  Anadministrator can take a table space on or off line at will, while the restof the database stays online.andP;  Table spaces allow you to, for example, storespecific tables in the database on different disks, or make a portion of thedatabase unavailable for updates.andM;Oracle stores all information about tables, columns, views, indexes, users,access privileges, and storage allocations in the data dictionary.andM;Creating Tables.andP;  Table creation hasn't changed since our last evaluation ofOracle.andP;  You use the &quot;create table&quot; SQL command in SQL*Plus, enter the tablename and each column name, and enter the type and length (if appropriate).andM;Oracle supports fie generic data types: char and varchar (up to 240characters), numeric (up to 38 digits), date, long char (allowing a column tobe 64KB in length), and raw.andP;  (We were somewhat disappointed that Oracle madeno mention of plans to support image or user-defined data types.)andM;SQL*Forms lets you refine your definition of character and numeric datatypes.andP;  You can specify alpha (only spaces and lower/upper-case letters),integer (no decimals), money, and a number of other restrictions.andO;Unfortunately, thee only apply to data centered on the form, not data enteredwith SQL statements in SQL*Plus.andM;Oracle supports the concept of nulls, or unknown values and any column in atable can be defined as null or not null.andP;  Oracle can display null valueswith a specified value, such as &quot;N/A.&quot;andP;  Oracle also supports views, whichmake it possible to manipulate the logical structure of the application whilehiding the physical representation of data.andP;  Views can be queried, and if theviewer has permission, the underlying table can be changed through the view.andM;Modifying Table Structure.andP;  As is the case with most RDBMSs, you can't changethe table structure once it's been defined except with the &quot;alter table&quot; SQLcommand.andP;  In Oracle, the only way to delete or rename columns is to create anew table from the old one, using a nested query to select those columnsdesired from the old table.andP;  To add a non-null column to a table after rowshave already been inserted in the table, you add the column as acceptingnulls, fill in values for the existing rows, and then modify the column tonon-null status.andM;There ought to be an easier way.andP;  We'd appreciate some additional options fortable modification--and not just from Oracle.andP;  Most RDBMSs are found lackingin this.andP;  It's not easy designing database tables, and you'll be hard-pressedto get it right the first time.andM;FORMS.andP;  Forms designed with the SQL*Forms module can be used to enter andedit data, perform queries, and build complex applications (see Illustration3).andP;  The current implementation of SQL*Forms hasn't changed much since ourlast review, either.andP;  But that's okay.andP;  We were impressed with its power andflexibility then and we are now.andM;A form is made up of an unlimited number of &quot;blocks.&quot;andP;  Each block representsdata from a single table and can display multiple rows of data.andP;  Pre- andpost-processing triggers can be added at the field, block, and form level foradditional validation and database processing.andP;  A trigger can be an SQLcommand, a function-key macro, or a 3GL program.andP;  They can be chainedtogether for sophisticated routines.andM;Menus, fill-in-boxes, and overlapping windows guide you through forms andapplication design, so it's not difficult to create a form.andP;  After youidentify the appropriate blocks and fields, SQL*Forms generates a defaultform, which you can modify and customize with a screen painter.andP;  It'scharacter-based, so the screen-painter isn't exactly slick or intuitive.andP;  Butonce you get the hang of the function keys, it's not difficult.andM;Defining Fields.andP;  You define field attributes and validation criteria foreach field simply by selecting items on a list in a window.andP;  Likewise, youcan define a default value and a customized help message.andP;  Data validationcan be very complex and sophisticated, providing referential integrity in theapplication, a list of valid values (from another table), and a range ofvalues.andP;  You can also connect master records to detail records on amultitable form.andM;Defining Blocks.andP;  At the block level, the forms designer can specify options,such as the sequence number for blocks in a multitable form and defaultordering (&quot;where&quot; and/or &quot;order by&quot; clauses that apply to all queries for theblock).andM;New Interface.andP;  Because of the innate richness of SQL*Forms, it naturallytakes some time and effort to master.andP;  Once you start creating intricateapplications, it gets a little mind-boggling.andP;  Triggers involve programmingand can be especially tricky.andP;  They demand a clear understanding of theobjectives, implications, and appropriate timing of trigger steps.andP;  Oraclehas done a decent job on the current user interface with the incorporation ofmenus and overlapping windows.andP;  We have some interface complaints concerningthe version of SQL*Forms we were working on--e.g., inflexible keystrokerequirements and an unorganized menu structure.andM;However, Oracle has released a bit-mapped interface for SQL*Forms for Sun andUltrix workstations.andP;  And X- and Motif-based versions will be available inFebruary.andP;  The mousedriven, icon-based interface is much better suited forapplication and forms design.andP;  The interface uses windows, menus, and buttonsthat match the standard functions found in the traditional SQL*Forms product.andM;DATA ENTRY AND EDITING.andP;  You can enter and edit data in a table using eitherSQL*Plus (SQL commands) or SQL*Forms.andP;  We recommended using SQL*Forms.andM;SQL*Plus.andP;  SQL doesn't let you add multiple records to a table with onecommand (although in SQL*Plus you can use parameters to enter one recordafter another without having to reenter the entire SQL command).andO;Furthermore, validity checking is limited.andP;  Oracle ensures that data enteredis the right data type and length, that all mandatory (not null) fields areentered, and that uniqueness is maintained where specified in the index.andP;  Butthat's it.andP;  Other validity checks, such as ranges for a value or a list ofacceptable values, are not available.andP;  Oracle recognizes this problem, andtold us that a &quot;with check&quot; option helps to some degree by extending defaultdata checks.andP;  Additional solutions are under development.andM;SQL*Forms.andP;  SQL*Forms is a better approach for entering and editing data.andP;  Aswe mentioned, on a form, you can include extensive validity checks forentering and updating data.andP;  However, these checks do not affect data enteredvia SQL commands.andP;  Since Oracle has no central repository of data validationand integrity rules, they must be included at the application level (in aform created with SQL*Forms or in a program written in PL/SQL or a 3GL).andM;External Files.andP;  The SQL*Loader can read external (non-Oracle) flat files ina sequential, fixed- or variable-length format.andP;  This utility is designed fora developer or, at least, a very experienced user.andM;INDEXING.andP;  Indexing in Oracle is straightforward and flexible.andP;  Once created,an index is automatically maintained.andP;  The number of indexes for a table isunlimited, and indexes can be created or dropped at any time.andP;  The index keycan be based on multiple columns but cannot be longer than 240 characters.andM;The existence of indexes is transparent.andP;  Oracle automatically keeps track ofwhat indexes exist and uses them as necessary in optimizing query-processing.andO;The user never needs to specify the use of an index when creating a querystatement.andM;QUERIES.andP;  Queries are generated using SQL*Forms (for Query by Example) andSQL*Plus.andP;  Unfortunately, SQL*QMX is not yet widely available under Unix.andM;SQL*Forms.andP;  An SQL*Form can be used to query by example.andP;  You display theform, hit the &quot;query&quot; function key, and enter your criteria.andP;  You can enteran exact match or an SQL &quot;where&quot; statement in any of the fields.andP;  SQL*Formsdoes not tell you how many records it retrieved unless you hit a function key(of course, you can always scroll through all of them to get to the finalcount).andM;SQL*Plus.andP;  In SQL*Plus, you query the database using the standard SQL&quot;select&quot; command.andP;  SQL*Plus tells you how many rows were retrieved in aquery.andP;  As we have mentioned, you can edit the current query (the one storedin the SQL buffer), and save and retrieve repetitive queries.andP;  Stored queriescan be executed at the time you enter SQL*Plus or at any time from withinSQL*Plus with the &quot;start&quot; command.andP;  Stored queries can also includevariables, or parameters, that can be entered by the user when the query isrun.andP;  This is particularly helpful when, for instance, you need to addseveral new records to the database, or when you wish to see the results ofdifferent sets of values in the &quot;where&quot; clause.andM;The &quot;column&quot; command provides customized formatting and headings for a columnin a list of query results.andP;  A column command is independent of the table;the command applies to all instances of that column name, even if it appearsin multiple tables.andP;  This command stays in effect until you exit fromSQL*Plus or change the column characteristics.andP;  To avoid having to reentercolumn commands over and over, you can store them in a file and have the fileexecuted automatically at the beginning of each SQL*Plus session.andP;  Onefeature we would have liked but couldn't find anywhere is the ability to listthe current settings for column headings and other parameters in SQL*Plus--astatus screen of some sort.andM;The number of tables that can be joined in a single query is unlimited.andP;  Andtables can be joined based on criteria other than exact matches.andP;  Oraclesupports outer joins.andM;In addition, Oracle has a &quot;soundex function,&quot; which accommodates spellingvariations (e.g., Alan, Allan, Allen, and Allyn).andP;  It can also interpret datain tables that contain hierarchical relationships.andM;REPORTS.andP;  Oracle's premiere reporting tool, the SQL*ReportWriter, has amenu-driven, forms-based interface.andP;  This is a step up from Oracle's previousreport writer, RPT/RPF (it's still available, by the way), which, thoughflexible enough, requires that you write a program to generate a report.andO;While mastering SQL*ReportWriter takes some time, it offers a good degree offlexibility.andP;  For instance, it allows for multiple queries, and it bolstersOracle's distributed architecture by allowing applications to access datafrom different hardware platforms and operating systems.andM;SQL*Plus.andP;  SQL*Plus also offers some relatively easy formatting commands forsimple reporting requirements.andP;  In addition to the &quot;column&quot; command, you candefine &quot;break on&quot; and &quot;compute sum&quot; commands to calculate totals andsubtotals on one or more columns.andP;  SQL*Plus reports provide centeredpage-headings and automatic page-numbering and date.andM;CUSTOMIZING APPLICATIONS.andP;  Oracle's primary tools for application developmentare SQL*Forms and SQL*Menu.andP;  The triggers in SQL*Forms let a developer writeapplications without really programming.andP;  However, as we have seen, triggersare, essentially, a programming language.andP;  And, since they're sosophisticated and complex, the company offers training classes to helpdevelopers master them.andP;  PL/SQL provides the 3GL functionality missing inSQL*Forms, so if you purchase the transaction processing option, Oracle givesyou a 4GL-like environment.andM;DATABASE SECURITY.andP;  We mentioned earlier (&quot;User Interface&quot;) that a usernameand password ensure that an individual is an authorized Oracle user.andP;  Once inthe DBMS, Oracle provides several levels of data security using the standard&quot;grant&quot; and &quot;revoke&quot; commands.andM;The database administrator issues each user one of three levels of access:andM;* Connect access lets you log onto Oracle, query or update tables for whichaccess has been granted, and create views; a &quot;connect&quot; user cannot createtables or indexes.andM;* Resource access includes connect privileges plus allowing you to createtables and indexes and to grant and revoke privileges on these to otherusers.andM;* DBA access includes all of the connect and resource privileges and allowsyou to access any data in the database, grant and revoke access privileges atthe database level, create public synonyms, create and alter partitions, andperform full database exports, as well as other functions.andM;Version 6 has no notion of access to groups or applications, as does Ingres.andO;In a distributed environment, these two levels of access are particularlyimportant, and Oracle might want to consider implementing them.andM;FuturesandM;Along the way, we've mentioned some of the enhancements planned for Oracle'snext release, Version 7.andP;  With Version 7, Oracle hopes to extend its OLTP anddistributed capabilities with support for distributed transaction processing,data replication, and database-enforced integrity.andP;  (We hope thesecapabilities won't be sold as a separate option.)andP;  In addition, Version 7will include PL/SQL stored procedures and role-based security management.andM;Despite its insufficient OLTP functionality, the company is determined tomake a show in that area by porting Version 6 to powerful transactionprocessing hardware environments--Stratus Computer's XA2000 system andPyramid's MISserver line.andP;  Both computer lines are specifically architectedto handle parallel multiprocessing and fault-tolerant transaction processing,which can only enhance Oracle's performance.andP;  (Interestingly, Stratus is amarketer of Sybase.)andP;  Along with the port to Pyramid, Oracle announced ajoint venture with Independence Technologies (ITI) that will integrate theRDBMS with ITI's Transaction Manager, a transaction monitor facility.andP;  TheTransaction Manager is ITI's version of ATandamp;T's Tuxedo product.andP;  It'sbasically a traffic cop, monitoring and routing client processes to availableRDBMS servers in a distributed environment for systems that deal heavily inOLTP.andP;  Although the product will run initially on Pyramid's MISserver line,availability for other Unix platforms will be released later in the year.andM;Oracle made another important announcement with NCube Computer Corporation(Freemont, California) last June.andP;  NCube peddles supercomputers, and, duringthis year's first quarter, the Oracle RDBMS will be available for NCube 2,making Oracle available for the first time on a supercomputing platform.andO;Additional porting plans include Intel 80486 and, perhaps, i860.andM;The Bottom LineandM;Oracle has some impressive strengths, most notably its applicationdevelopment and end-user tools.andP;  We hear good things from developers aboutSQL*Forms--especially when used in conjunction with PL/SQL.andP;  Theimplementation of SQL*ReportWriter, with its menu-driven interface, is asignificant improvement over Oracle's previous report writer.andP;  SQL*Menu,Oracle's fourth-generation menu-development component, provides a smoothintegration among Oracle components.andM;Oracle's Unix environment, however, is incomplete--there are so many Unixvariations out there.andP;  Not all the tools--especially the new ones--aregenerally available under Unix.andM;Oracle's recent interest in applications and consulting might be distractingthe company from developing advanced RDBMS functionality.andP;  Oracle isobviously not just a database company any more.andP;  Its consulting avenue seemsto us to have an inherent conflict.andP;  What's in it for Oracle to recommendsomeone else's product?andP;  Clearly some objectivity gets lost.andM;But where we found Oracle seriously lacking was in the RDBMS core: noserver-side integrity rules or stored procedures, no user-defined data types,no data replication, no distributed transaction management, no partitioneddatabase tables...andP;  While Oracle plans to remedy these shortcomings withVersion 7, we'll postpone any comments on those remedies until the product isactually out.andP;  However, given Oracle's abundance of cash, we hope the RDBMSwon't suffer any technical deficiencies for long.andP;  Advanced functionality fordistributed computing and transaction processing may not have been originatedin Oracle's Randamp;D labs, but that doesn't mean the company can't capitalize onit once it's been incorporated.andP;  Considering Oracle's presence and marketing,it may profit substantially from technologies introduced elsewhere.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
