<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0498 </DOCNO><TEXT>Detailed worldwide measurements indicate that the amount of carbon dioxidein the earth's atmosphere has increased about 25 percent during the past188 years, primarily because of fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation.Carbon dioxide is one of several trace gases that can modify the earth'sheat balance by absorbing outgoing radiation from the earth's surface,thereby increasing the amount of heat retained by the atmosphere--theso-called greenhouse effect. Scientific analyses suggest that this increasecould substantially affect climate, agriculture, and other human endeavors.The Carbon Dioxide Research Program is aimed at improving the scientificknowledge base to enable researchers to project future atmospheric concentrationsof carbon dioxide, to estimate carbon dioxide-induced global and regionalclimate changes, and to assess the responses of vegetation to higherconcentrations of carbon dioxide and changing climate. The Departmentof Energy is the lead federal agency for research related to atmosphericcarbon dioxide. Its responsibility is to sponsor a program of directedresearch and to coordinate this research with relevant activities ofother federal agencies, private concerns, and international institutions.This Program Summary documents the activities and products of the CarbonDioxide Research (CDR) Program in Fiscal Year 1988. The Summary providesdescriptions of all projects funded during the year and a brief overviewof the CDR Program's goals, objectives, and organization. 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
