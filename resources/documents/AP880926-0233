Boesky andamp; Co.,the investment vehicle of the imprisoned stock speculator,according to a report published today.   The accord will result in a payment of $30 million to $50million to shareholders in companies who claim they were defraudedby Boesky, the New York Times said in a report attributed to peopleinvolved in the suits.   The accord is an agreement between 42 limited partners inBoesky's defunct firm; a British enterprise once controlled byBoesky; and shareholders of companies who claim they weredefrauded, the newspaper said.   The pact does not include the two central defendants, Boeskyhimself and his main underwriter, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., theTimes said.   ``The settlement is really a grand alliance that will make itmuch easier for us to pursue Ivan Boesky and Drexel Burnham,'' alawyer involved in negotiations between shareholders and the Boeskypartners told the Times.   Two years ago Boesky paid a $100 million fine to settlegovernment charges that he illegally traded on confidentialinformation. He is serving a three-year federal prison term afteradmitting that he conspired to file a false statement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
