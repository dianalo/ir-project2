As a result, the platforms expandthe numbers, diversity and range of many highly desirable fish, shellfishand other organisms. Fishing, mussel harvesting and shellfish mariculturehave become important activities on platforms. The current requirementthat platforms be entirely removed once production operations have ceasedthreatens to cause a large-scale loss of many habitats. However, a strongrigs-to-reefs movement is seeking to convert a number of the platformsinto permanent artificial reefs.</TEXT></DOC>
