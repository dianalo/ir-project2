 A yearaway from having profits and growth in place to support an offering.andP;  CarverMead is on the board.andP;  A new competitor is PlusLogic.andP;  Actel isn't wellknown.andM;1 Advanced Logic ResearchandM;Irvine, CA - High-performance, industry-standard microcomputer systems.andM;The company, 57% owned by Wearne Brothers Ltd. of Singapore, a subsidiary ofthe China Banking Corp., has developed a reputation for being fast to marketwith high-performance systems, claiming performance enhancements overcomparable and compatible IBM and Compaq systems.andP;  Similar to Everex, butwithout the peripherals business, or to Dell without the mail-order emphasis.andO;The company positions itself within the clone world as a &quot;mini-Compaq&quot;.andP;  Butwhat if it is a mini-Wyse?andP;  Company not well known.andM;4 Alias Research Inc.andM;Toronto, Canada -- Industrial design software for high-performanceworkstations.andM;Looking better after a difficult year.andP;  Suffered in 1989 from softness inmarket for high-performance workstations used in automotive and industrialdesign and in special effects for film and television broadcast.andP;  Niftyproducts.andP;  Similar to Wavefront.andP;  Revenues under $10 million.andM;1 Aspect TelecommunicationsandM;San Jose, CA -- Stand-alone automatic call distributor.andM;Should be a screamer, although not another Rolm.andP;  Expects $60 million inrevenues next year.andP;  Regarded as a well managed company.andP;  A leader in anincreasingly popular category.andP;  What does the company do next, diversify orexpand?andP;  Also see Syntellect.andM;3 Ateml Corp.andM;San Jose, CA -- EPROM and EEPROM IC's.andM;This renegade continues to charge along despite its apparent lack of friendsin high places.andP;  Atmel has been profitable in all five years of its history.andO;Revenues in 1989 exceeded $90 million, 50% growth from 1988, with fully taxedprofits of more than $7 million.andP;  Any public offering would surely have to bepreceded by a resolution of its legal problems with intel.andP;  Also seeMicrochip Technology.andM;3  Auspex SystemsandM;Santa Clara, CA -- File servers for networked worksation environments.andM;Seemingly hot on the heels of NetFrame in the dedicated market.andP;  Auspex isheaded in a somewhat different direction: its focus is workstation servers,not personal computers, specifically networks that exchange data under theNetwork File System (NFS).andP;  That means Sun, and, to a lesser extent, HP andDEC.andP;  An experienced management, rich with technical talent, has offered asystem that uses functionally coupled multiprocessors, each processor withsubstantial local memory.andP;  Sun has neglected this area but is playing a rapidgame of catch-up.andP;  IBM's new RISC/6000 machines also are UNIX file servers.andO;A long shot for 1991.andM;2  Bachman Information SystemsandM;Cambridge, MA -- Computer-aided software development.andM;Revenues will be about $10 million this fiscal year, ending June, and maybe$20 million next.andP;  IBM is a business partner.andM;1  Banyan SystemsandM;Westboro, MA -- Networking systems for workstations, personal computers andmainframes.andM;Sales are around $80 million.andP;  The company's products have more hardware thansome of its competitors, and margins are consequently somewhat lower; butthey are improving.andP;  Banyan seems to be doing well but could use helpdifferentiating itself from the pack.andP;  Warning: The channels of distributionin this business aren't easy to profit from.andM;2  Biosym TechnologiesandM;San Diego, CA -- Computer-aided molecular design software.andM;Revenues about $10 million.andP;  Could be profitable this year.andP;  Issue: How bigis the market?andP;  Market is clearly smaller than CAD and CAE, but how muchsmaller?andP;  As prices decline for color-imaging computers, at what point doesitbecome practical to put one on every chemist's bench?andP;  Also see Polygen.andM;3  Bitstream Inc.andM;Cambridge, MA -- Digital type and font-scaling technology.andM;A long shot for late 1991?andP;  Will need to exand.andP;  A deal with Royal in themaking?andM;4  Bridge Information SystemsandM;St.andP;  Louis, MO -- On-line data system and software.andM;A better acquisition for the likes of Dow Jones or Reuters, but a possibleIPO if it can earn more profit and isn't too badly damaged by the troubles onWall Street, where its financial database is widely used.andM;1  Brooktree Corp.andM;San Diego, CA -- High-performance analog-to-digital converters and graphicscircuits.andM;Forced to defend its turf against a spate of new entrants, AMD in particular,Brooktree has emerged from this latest round of competition match-tough.andP;  Thecompany is positioned to benefit from the growing need for mixed signaltechnology, the growth in graphics and imaging applications, and the risingfortunes of its workstation and desktop clients.andP;  It is another of thoesituations that make the three S's of silicon, systems, and software seemlike one.andP;  It could go public at any time.andP;  Revenues were over $50 millionlast year -- but finds valuations in the present market less than seductive.andM;2  Cadre TechnologyandM;Providence, RI -- Computer-aided software engineering.andM;About $70-$80 million in sales.andP;  Formed from the merger of Cadre Technologiesand MicroCASE, which was formerly Northwest instrument Systems.andM;4  Calera Recognition SystemsandM;Santa Clara, CA -- Document recognition equipment.andM;Not doing as well as expected.andP;  Customers love its products, but potentialcustomers don't seem to be getting the message.andP;  Needs low-end Macintoshproduct.andP;  IPO prospects helped by aftermarket performance of Caere, acompetitor.andP;  Also competes with Kurzwell unit of Xerox.andM;3  Central Point SoftwareandM;Beaverton, OR -- Microcomputer utility software.andM;Revenues at this company are around $27 million generated by products thathave all been developed internally.andP;  Prior fiscal year (April) revenues $16million.andP;  Company is 51% owned by Video Technology of China; an ESOP owns15%.andP;  Virtually all revenues come from PC Tools.andP;  See Norton and FifthGeneration.andP;  A plus for category: In the mainframe and mini areas, utilitysoftware companies have been very profitable and have developed continuingbusinesses.andM;2  Channelmark Corp.andM;San Mateo, CA -- Catalog distribution of software for personal computers.andM;Channelmark's focus is strictly small-ticket purchases by retail customers towhich it markets only through a catalog.andP;  The CEO says he intends to gopublic but is making few motions in that direction.andM;1  Claris Corp.andM;Mountain View, CA -- Software for Apple personal computers.andM;This company has been going public for a long time.andP;  Its association withApple has been a double-edged sword, forcing it into the limelightprematurely.andP;  Public expectations for the pace of new product developmenthave been unrealistically aggressive, and the speculation about a publicoffering endless.andP;  On the other hand, Claris has enjoyed a running start,inheriting a portfolio of products and immediate brand recognition fromApple.andP;  In the meantime, the company has proven that it can developsuccessful products on its own.andP;  Disentanglement from Apple will be criticalto its future access to other systems companies.andP;  Sales approaching $100million.andP;  For now, Apple doesn't need more to think about.andP;  (See issue ofNov. 20, 1989.)andM;3  Crystal Semiconductor Corp.andM;Austin, TX -- Integrated circuits incorporating digitally enhanced analogdesigns for use in specific markets.andM;It was slow-going for Crystal in the early years.andP;  The technical goal wasambitious, the investment cosiderable, and the company was behind plan for awhile.andP;  But it is back on track now with sales ramping up.andP;  Not ready for thepublic markets this year but may be next year.andP;  One issue: Are its parts easyenough to design in?andM;3  CyrixandM;Richardson, TX -- VLSI application accelerators.andM;Formed by a group of Texas instruments alumni (this would appear to be aSevin Rosen trademark).andP;  Cyrix is a possibility for late 1991.andP;  Like Cypress,the strategy is to go after existing sockets with better technology.andP;  Thecompany makes 8387 pin-compatible products that offer improved performanceover the intel part.andP;  Just began shipping.andP;  Formerly known as AdvancedProcessor Technology.andP;  Questions: Does it offer enough improvement inperformance?andP;  Must the answers from compatible circuits be identical withthose of the original?andP;  Are math co-processors really a product for OEMchannels or is the retail aftermarket more important?andM;2  Datalogix Formula SystemsandM;Valhalla, NY -- Integrated software systems to process/formula-basedmanufacturers.andM;Profitable for several quarters.andP;  UNIX-based system with HP, Unisys and DECas marketing partners.andM;3  DAVID SystemsandM;Sunnyvale, CA -- Telecommunications equipment.andM;Diversified into the local area networking business.andP;  Added Ethernet overtwisted pair, now competes in part with Synoptics and Cabietron.andP;  Also has anew product called Volksnet.andM;4  Digital F/XandM;Santa Clara, CA -- Workstations for video past-production.andM;Lots of electronic razzle-dazzle, but more technology than company.andP;  Firstproduct satisfactory, second product late.andP;  High potential if so-calledmultimedia technology catches on, especially in consumer electronics, but thepace of development must quiken.andP;  In the interim, a niche player.andM;2  Electronic Design Inc.andM;Hopkinton, MA -- Digital semiconductor modules in leadless ceramic carriers.andM;A buyout earning a nice profit in an unexciting component business withJapanese competitors.andP;  Hard to interest Institutional buyers.andM;2  Epoch SystemsandM;Marlborough, MA -- Network file system-compatible server for workstationenvironments.andM;Doing well in an emerging market that already has too many competitors.andO;Could be a candiate in 1991 if it turns profitable and sales approach $20million.andP;  (Compare with Auspex and NetFrame.)andM;2  Farallon Computing Inc.andM;Berkeley, CA -- Communications and multimedia software and hardware for theMacintosh.andM;Regards its business as &quot;personal communications&quot;.andP;  Farallon's growth --sales of about $30 million and profits from the beginning -- has beenunabetted by venture capital, indeed by much capital of any sort.andP;  Usingordinary phone wire.andP;  Farallon has offered a low-cost way of networking Macsand peripherals, nimbly identifying and exploiting a rapidly growing niche ina crowded market.andP;  Farallon differentiates itself as the company thatdemystifles networking.andP;  A creative product development team is focused onfront-end applications for ISDN.andP;  (See issue of May 15, 1989.)andM;4  FiberComandM;Roanoake, VA -- Fiberoptic local area networks and government contracting.andM;Increasing momentum and on plan for 1989, although still as profitable as itshould be.andP;  Revenues less than $30 million.andP;  Merger or sale more likely thanIPO.andM;1  Fifth Generation Systems Inc.andM;Baton Rouge, LA -- Hardware and software utility, data security andperipheral sharing computer products.andM;One of several small players nibbling at this market, Fifth Generationoperates more as a publisher than as a developer.andP;  At one point, was going tobuy Norton, but the deal fell through.andP;  Highly profitable on revenuesapproaching $50 million.andP;  (See also Central Point.)andM;3  Frame Technology Corp.andM;San Jose, CA -- Document processing software.andM;In just three years, Frame has bolted out of the gate to become a leadingchallenger to interleaf.andP;  Revenues exceeded $22 million in 1989, with grossmargin a whopping 90%.andP;  In prior year, revenues were $9.2 million.andO;FrameMaker, sold as unbundled software at a retail price, has had atremendous boost from its close relationships with NeXT and Businessland.andO;Such heady growth needs a seasoned team at the top.andP;  A new CEO has just comeon board.andP;  (For more information, see issue of July 24, 1989.)andM;3  Gazelle Microcircuits Inc.andM;Santa clara, CA -- Gallium arsenide integrated circuits.andM;Gazelle claims its GaAs ICs are silicon-compatible, using amicroprocessor-compatible interface to its ICs and eliminating performancebottlenecks.andP;  (See also Vitesse.)andM;4  GO Corp.andM;San Francisco, CA -- Portable computer with handwritten input.andM;If the product is launched this summer, as most people expect, then cashneeds are likely to be very high a year later, assuming product success.andM;2  Gupta TechnologiesandM;Menio Park, CA -- Relational databse software for PC local area networks.andM;Big in the client-sever world.andP;  Founder was among the early developers ofOracle's data base.andP;  Company has deals with Lotus and others.andP;  Revenues about$7 million.andP;  Plan is $12 million this year.andM;2  Health Data SciencesandM;San Bernardino, CA -- Computer systems for hospitals.andM;Earning about $1 million on $20 million in sales.andP;

 Its products have offered a breakthough in semiconductormanufacturing metrology, brining profits and cash flow unusually early, andencroaching on KLA's turf.andP;  This is a tough business, where each act is ashard as the last.andP;  (Compare with Orbot Systems.)andM;3  Integrated CMOS SystemsandM;Sunnyvale, CA -- Complex CMOS gate arrays.andM;More of a design house than a manufacturing company.andM;2  Integrated Network Corp.andM;Bridgewater, NJ -- Public network communications systems.andM;In no hurry.andP;  Now that DSC has agreed to buy Optilink, this is the onlystartup in its niche.andP;  Competes with Northern Telecom and ATandamp;T.andP;  Back ontrack -- expecting 35% revenue increase this year -- as it recovers from lastyear's telephone strike, which badly hurt its third quarter.andP;  Quarterlyrevenues running at $35 million now.andP;  Strike effects raise the question: Towhat degree does this company control its own destiny?andP;  IPO buyers would needto see clear evidence of steady growth.andM;1  Internet Systems Corp.andM;Chicago, IL -- Transaction-processing software for international banking.andM;About $20 million in revenues.andP;  Needs a few more profitable quarters and moreU.S.andP;  customers.andP;  Elegant software but expensive.andP;  Long sales cycle.andP;  (Seealso Sybase.)andM;2  IXYS Corp.andM;San Jose, CA -- Semi-custom andamp; custom power semiconductors for motors,controllers andamp; power supplies.andM;In its recent acquisition of ASEA Brown Boverl's power semiconductoroperations, IXYS also acquired ABB as a major investor and preferred vendor.andO;(Compare with Power Integrations.)andM;2  Metaphor Computer SystemsandM;Mountain View, CA -- Systems for information analysis.andM;CEO Liddle is an eloquent spokesman for his company and for his industry.andP;  Hejokes that he has more venture investors than anyone.andP;  Surely they will wantout some day.andP;  The company is getting out of the hardware business, whichshould improve its margins.andP;  Metaphor filed on offering in 1987 only to seeit aborted by the stock market crash.andP;  Since then, has formed promisingalliance with IBM.andM;3  Microchip TechnologyandM;Chandler, AZ -- Integrated circuits.andM;Venture-backed buyout of General instruments' chip business, presentlyrunning at $90 million and barely profitable.andP;  Strong position in somehigh-growth semiconductor markets, including EEPROMs and digital signalprocessors.andP;  Will have to prove it can earn enough on thee products to staythe course in manufacturing technology.andP;  Has own fab.andP;  (See also Atmel.)andM;2  MicrografxandM;Richardson, TX -- Graphics application software.andM;Riding the wave of Microsoft Windows, which it once had almost to itself.andO;Should benefit from all the clamor over Windows 3.0 this spring.andP;  Goodproducts for those who earn a living in graphics; otherwise, difficult touse.andP;  One program, Designer, enjoys steady sales.andP;  Growing about 50% annualin revenues.andM;4  Multiflow ComputerandM;Branford, CT -- High-performance parallel-processing systems for science andengineering.andM;Its debut made quite a splash as a conceptual play in parallel processing,with technical specs that were supposed to leave Alliant in the dust.andO;There's been a lot of dust in the path of parallel processing, and Multiflowstill has a long way to go.andP;  Riding renewed interest in very-long instructionword architectures.andP;  Helped by recent alliance with intel, but it's not easythese days to build a company around a proprietary, custom processor.andM;2  NetFrame SystemsandM;Sunnyvale, CA -- Servers for local area networks.andM;A Tandem in the making?andP;  Net-Frame's start has been a sizzling one, with astellar cast.andP;  The combination of technical and marketing talent in Amdahiand Torresi is compeling.andP;  And the market opportunity is vast: as networksproliferate, users want something more as servers than reconfigured PCs andworkstations.andP;  NetFrame has offered a system with a mainframe style I/Ochannel in a few chips as well as improved data integrity.andP;  Company expectsto add 50 value-added resellers this year to supplement the Businesslandoutlets.andP;  The fight for this market will be flerce.andP;  Established systemscompanies have already started slinging mud, and a host of start-ups arestalking NetFrame.andP;  One key question: Can Businessland sell a product in thisprice range that lacks the IBM logo?andP;  (See also Auspex and Epoch Systems.)andM;2  Netrix Corp.andM;Hemdon, VA -- Wide-area network switch.andM;Doing $10 million annualized.andP;  More likely to be sold than to go public, butin either case needs more profitability.andM;2  Network Computing DevicesandM;Mountain View, CA -- X-window alisplay stations.andM;Founders Estrin and Carrico, a husband and wife team who founded in a priorlife, have attracted an enormous amount of publicity.andP;  This is one whereperformance may exceed the hype: the company shipped its first product lastmonth and projects revenues of $50 million this year, ahead of plan.andO;Profitable for several months.andP;  Revenues running $3 million to $4 million amonth with significant order backlogs.andP;  By year-end, expects profits of morethan 50% after tax.andP;  A problem: Overcoming the reputation -- established bythe likes of Beehive, Lear Sigler, Tele Video, and Wyse -- that terminalcompanies fade.andP;  In the past, success in terminals has always gone to thecompany with the lowest cost of parts of labor.andP;  But in the future, embeddedsoftware may count for more, which would benefit NCD.andM;1  Network Management Inc.andM;Fairfax, VA -- Network design and analysis.andM;A number of the founders in NMI come from Contel Information Systems.andP;  Thecompany's vision is of a world where systems integration, network design, andnetwork management all comes together.andP;  Its growth has been through smallacquisitions, built on a foundation of government work.andP;  The segue fromgovernment to commercial may be difficult.andP;  Revenues are at a $60 millionannual run rate.andM;3  NeXT Computer SystemsandM;Redwood City, CA -- Workstations for universities and business.andM;Jobs says he does not want his company public, and we have no reason not tobelieve him.andP;  Still, it could happen.andP;  NeXT has been extremely creative infinding alternative sources of capital.andP;  Even more creativity will be neededto keep all those employees motivated, surrounded as they are by the liquidculture of Silicon Valley.andP;  With few applications, disappointing sales, andmany doubters, not an IPO for this year.andM;4  On TechnologyandM;Boston, MA -- Software for personal computers.andM;Restarted after Mitch Kapar's initial plans proved too ambitious.andP;  Firstproduct, a Macintosh utility, is excellent and should be a good cashgenerator, although not an idea big enough to support much of a company.andO;Follow-on products will be watched closely.andP;  (Compare with Central Point,Fifth Generation, and Peter Norton.)andM;1  Orbot SystemsandM;Yavneh, Israel -- Automatic vision inspection systems for printed circuitboard and semiconductor industry.andM;Although based in Israel, Orbot plans an IPO in the U.S.andP;  The company is amarket leader, selling its products worldwide to an impressive list ofcustomers, of which IBM is the largest and accounts for 20% of revenues.andO;With the software content of its products high (and the Israeli tax ratelow), Orbot enjoys very high margins.andP;  Revenues in 1989 were $60 million andexpected to grow to $80 million in 1990.andP;  Historically, this area hasattracted little institutional interest.andP;  (Compare with InSystems.)andM;1  Performance Semiconductor Corp.andM;Sunnyvale, CA -- High-performance CMOS static memories, logic andmicroprocessor components.andM;A perennial favorite on our lists and at our conferences, Performance couldgo public at any time but has been little in the public markets to tempteither the management or the board.andP;  Positioned at the head of the evolutionto CMOS.andP;  Performance is one of the few young semi companies that hasmaintained a presence in process technology and manufacturing.andP;  Founder TomLongo is a seasoned industry vet.andP;  If the recent signs of life in semi stock(dare we say &quot;rally&quot;?) continue, we would expect this to be one of the firstout.andP;  For now, static RAM market is too soft, should look for second half IPOwith hope that SRAM prices firm as DRAM prices have begun to do.andM;2  Peter Norton Computing Inc.andM;Santa Monica, CA -- Develops and markets microcomputer-based utilities.andM;Norton's initial growth has been based on utilities software for the IBM PC.andO;The company brought in Ron Posner to build sales to a critical mass necessaryfor a public offering.andP;  But what's next?andP;  Plans are to expand the productline across multiple platforms and to enter new software categories.andP;  Apublic offering will probably await the successful release of a number of newproducts.andP;  The two core PC products, Commander and Utilities, have lostground to products from Fifth Generation and, mostly, Central Point.andM;2  Polygen SystemsandM;Waltham, MA -- Integrated molecular modeling system.andM;Applications software for high-performance computers like such a naturalbusiness, but neither this company nor its principal competitor.andP;  BioSymTechnologies, seems able to make much money.andP;  One day, will this be anotherLandmark Graphics?andP;  Nice deal with IBM.andP;  (Also see Biosym.)andM;2  Poqet Computer Corp.andM;Sunnyvale, CA -- Makes pocket-sized personal computers that are IBMcompatible.andM;Fujitsu owns 38%, giving Poquet a powerful partner.andP;  Through computers thatwill fit in a pocket, the company has an opportunity to gain a foothold inthe crowded portables market.andP;  Initial product is expensive.andP;  Will have highcapital needs to finance launch of second product.andP;  (See also Go Corp.)andM;3  Power IntegrationsandM;Mountain View, CA -- Design integrated circuits incorporating logic and powerfunctions.andM;The significant commercial potential of this company's technology is in itsability to isolate high voltages from low voltages.andP;  The &quot;chip in a plug&quot; atpresent provides a power function.andP;  Future products will have intelligencebuilt in to them -- so-called smart power.andP;  A young company, this is a longshot for 1991.andP;  (See IXYS Corp.)andM;3  PrairieTekandM;Longmont, CO -- high-performance, small form-factor disk subsystems for thelaptop computer market.andM;Prairie Tek has targeted a high-growth portion of the microcomputer market:laptop and pocketbooks.andP;  The company has just started to ship its initialproduct, a 2-2/2&quot; disk drive.andP;  Sales are small now, but if the product is ahit it will be a big hit, and the company will need a lot of capital.andP;  Did $4million in revenues last year and if it were taking orders, could have a $100million backlog.andP;  If it doesn't go public in 1991, probably never will.andO;Should raise large mezzanine round this year to compete with ConnerPeripherals.andP;  One possible strategy is to sell drives to those portable makesin Japan that compete with Conner's customers.andP;  In the end, however, this isstill the disk drive business, where those who succeed do so by making a lotof drives and making them cheap.andP;  (See also insite.)andM;2  Progress SoftwareandM;Bedford, MA -- Application development software.andM;Fourth-generation applications development language built around a company'sown database.andP;  Sales about $25 million; projecting $40 million this year.andO;Earnings almost 10% after tax.andP;  To some extent competes with databasecompanies.andM;1  Proteon Inc.andM;Boston, MA -- High-speed, high-performance, multi-Vendor networks andinternetworking systems.andM;Proteon is well positioned with leading PC vendors; it claims to be thesecond largest token ring supplier to IBM, the Compaq LAN of choice with itsdealers, and the recent recipient of a large contract with ATandamp;T to helpupgrade American Airlines' Sabre system.andP;  Revenues were $47 million lastyear, expected to do $75 - $100 million this year.andP;  Last year's turnaroundstory.andP;  Proteon seems now to be in a breakout mode.andM;3  Quarterdeck Office SystemsandM;Santa Monica, CA -- DOS productivity software.andM;Focus and determination have brought this company back, but iths moreattractive to a corporate buyer than to the public.andP;  Quarterdeck was one ofthe early software start-ups, focused on windowing and multitasking.andP;  Thecompany has broadened its product line to include some successful memorymanagement products, and revenues are around $16 million.andP;  But what willhappen if Microsoft, after six years of trying, has finally got its ownwindowing product right this time?andM;1  Radius Inc.andM;San Jose, CA -- Add-on hardware for Apple Macintosh family of computers.andM;If Radius were to follow the route of PC peripheral companies, it would startmaking Mac clones about now.andP;  Having rapidly established itself as a marketleader in graphics enhancements for the Mac, with $100 million in sales,Radius completed a first act that will be hard to follow.andP;  Fortunately, thesecond act will not be a Mac clone or even a Mac III but expansion to newplatforms and new technologies, including alternatives to cathode raytechnology.andP;  Will the company delay an offering until it has a product on anew platform?andM;1  RasterOpsandM;Cupertino, CA -- Graphics products for Apple Macintosh II computer systems.andM;Similar to Radius, RasterOps differentiates itself with a series of colormonitors and products already for IBM and Sun as well as Mac.andP;  Sales arerunning about $50 million.andP;  SuperMac is right behind these two.andP;  Securitiesmarket probably won't support three such companies, especially with the lowmultiple on Apple Computer.andP;  Low profits.andM;1  RetixandM;Santa Monica, CA -- OSI standard communications equipment and software.andM;Probably the largest of a new generation of internetworking of wide areanetworking companies, Retix achieved sales of $35 million last year andexpects growth this year of 50%.andP;  Its good fortunes have been tied to theacceptance of OSI-based software as a world communications standard.andO;Although a robust market, it is also crowded, and the players are likely tobecome more difficult to differentiate.andP;  Needs higher margins.andM;2  Santa Cruz OperationandM;Santa Cruz, CA -- UNIX application software.andM;At the crest of the UNIX wave, SCO could easily be a $200 million company inthe next two to three years and could certainly enter the public market now.andO;But management speaks of being reluctant to be public.andP;  As a major supplierand shareholder.andP;  Microsoft would seem a natural acquirer to OS/2 as part ofthe extended rather than the immediate family.andP;  The company is working on itsbottom line, where sales per employee has been a persistent issue.andP;  (Seeissue of Feb. 5, 1990.)andM;3  Sierra SemiconductorandM;San Joe, CA -- Application-specific and standard integrated circuits.andM;One of several mixed-signal companies in the pipeline, Sierra previouslyattempted to tap the public market with a silent filing in 1988.andP;  Since then,the company has reduced its dependence on the custom business, built up itsstandard product line, introduced several new products, and begun productionin a new Singapore fab, joint ventured with National Semiconductor andSingapore Technology.andP;  Revenues are about $60 million, and bookings have beenstrong recently.andM;2  Software 2000 Inc.andM;Hyannis, MA -- Financial, personal and industrial safety sofware for the IBMAS-400.andM;Management uninterested in going public, but company is very profitable.andO;Could this be another System Software Associates?andM;3  SRXandM;Dallas, TX -- Customer-premises telecommunications systems.andM;Outstanding management in a tough market.andP;  SRX has managed cash well whileavoiding such labels as &quot;an IVDT company&quot; or &quot;an ISDN play.&quot;andP;  The company isshifting its strategy, investing in what it considers to be its architecturaladvantage to achieve the functional integration of voice and data systems.andM;3  StardentandM;Sunnyvale, CA -- Graphics supercomputers.andM;Although the company has new product, its initial offering were a year lateand twice as costly as projected, which gave Silicon Graphics the catch-upchance it needed.andP;
