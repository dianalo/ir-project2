The proposed delay of the trial, which is scheduled to start next week, was immediately seized on by defense lawyers as an indication that the government was having trouble proving its case against the three executives, whose arrests in February stunned Wall Street. The lawyers indicated they would oppose any delay in the start of the trial. The government wants a postponement until July 20.    The three executives awaiting trial are Robert M. Freeman, a partner and head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs and Co.; Richard B. Wigton, who was head of arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. at the time of his arrest; and Timothy L. Tabor, a former arbitrager at Kidder, a General Electric Co. unit. The three men were indicted by a federal grand jury in April on various charges of fraud and conspiracy to violate securities laws. They have denied the charges.    At a pre-trial hearing before U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton yesterday, prosecutor Neil S. Cartusciello disclosed that the government is seeking the postponement. But defense lawyers complained they hadn't been told about the government's plans or served with court papers, and arguments on the issue were delayed by the judge for another hearing today.    In court papers supporting its motion, the government said the grand jury investigation &quot;has turned out to be substantially more complex and complicated than originally anticipated at the time of the defendants' arrests.&quot; The government revealed that it plans to seek an expanded indictment of the three executives, including &quot;a large number of substantive counts&quot; involving trading in the securities of &quot;approximately nine different companies involved in mergers, takeovers and similar events during 1984 and 1985.&quot; So far, the government has leveled charges involving the securities of two companies, Unocal Corp. and Storer Communications Inc.    The government said it will seek the new indictment by or during the week of June 8.    A postponement to July 20 would extend the trial date a month beyond the 70 days set forth by the federal Speedy Trial Act. However, the act permits a court to extend the trial date, in particular for complex cases.    In its court papers, the government said that it needs at least until July 20 to complete the grand jury investigation, comply with discovery requests for documents by defense lawyers and prepare for trial. Since the February arrests, the government said it had issued about 90 subpoenas for documents and personal appearances and interviewed about 60 witnesses. The government said the defendants were seeking an immediate trial in a hope &quot;to gain a tactical advantage over prosecutors.&quot;    The three executives are the first individuals to press their cases to trial in the yearlong Wall Street insider-trading scandal. Defense lawyers have argued from the start that too much of the case relies on the testimony of former Kidder investment banker Martin A. Siegel, who pleaded guilty in February to two felonies involving insider trading after implicating the three others. He is expected to be the government's chief witness.    Defense lawyers have complained that the government only began its investigation in earnest following the arrests, which were made on information supplied by Mr. Siegel.    Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Wigton's lawyer, said the government's request for postponement is &quot;outrageous at this late date after an arrest in February. It's apparent whatever case the government claims to have it doesn't even understand. This again brings the entire arrest procedure into focus as an abuse.&quot;    The government has alleged that Kidder Peabody reaped millions of dollars in insider-trading profit from a scheme involving the defendants and Mr. Siegel. Mr. Siegel, who once directed Kidder's arbitrage activities, has admitted to trading inside information with Mr. Freeman.    The plea agreement Mr. Siegel made with the government has thus become a sticky issue as both sides prepare for trial. Prosecutors don't want to make the agreement public until the night before Mr. Siegel is called as a witness, citing traditional disclosure practices. The defense is demanding disclosure of the agreement, as well as any agreements Mr. Siegel has with the Securities and Exchange Commission, well before he takes the stand. Judge Stanton said at the hearing that he will review the plea agreement to see if the defense should get a copy now. </TEXT></DOC>
