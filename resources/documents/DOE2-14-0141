Foreign companies are being lured back into the explorationbusiness with new production-sharing contracts. And in the LNG business,where Algeria is on of the major producers, exports to the United Stateshave been resumed at world market prices. Deliveries to Britain are dueto resume later this year and new contracts have been signed for deliveriesto Turkey and Greece, all at competitive market prices. Excluded fromthis turnaround in attitudes are Algeria's traditional customers forLNG in Europe. Sonatrach, the Algerian state energy company, is stillinsisting on prices that make imported LNG up to 30% more expensive thangas from other sources. As a result LNG liftings have declined and gascompanies in France, Belgium, and Spain are in dispute with Sonatrachover prices.</TEXT></DOC>
