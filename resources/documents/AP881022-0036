The whales followed the escape route all the way to the 24thbreathing hole cut by the workers by Friday night, bringing them ahalf mile closer to open water now four miles away, said NationalGuard Col. Tom Carroll.   The Skycrane heavy-lift helicopter loaned by the Alaska ArmyNational Guard arrived earlier Friday from Prudhoe Bay with asteel-tipped concrete cylinder, a remnant from construction of thetrans-Alaska oil pipeline.   It finally began punching holes through the ice about 4 p.m. (8p.m.) EDT, but stopped after about an hour and a half as darknessfell.   The helicopter is also creating a series of breathing holes thatrescuers hope the whales will follow to open water some four milesaway.   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the`bullet','' Palmer said. ``It drops through the ice on the secondor third try. Then they pull it back out.   ``Some of the ice comes with it. They try to pull out as much aspossible. The holes _ and I've heard they punched through three orfour averaging 15 to 20 minutes per hole _ are about 20 by 30 feet.They're approximately 100 feet apart,'' he said.   Palmer said the helicopter started its ice-bashing near a leadabout four miles from the whales.   ``We're trying not to scare the whales until the last possiblemoment,'' he said. ``At last count, they figured it would take 24to 26 hours if they work continuously. But they have to stop fordarkness.''   The young California gray whales were imprisoned in shallowwater about 100 yards from shore by thickening, shifting ice abouttwo weeks ago. They have been breathing through small holes in theice about 13 miles northwest of this tiny village on Alaska'sdesolate northern coast.   More than a dozen volunteers decided Friday not to wait for thehelicopter and began carving long narrow holes in the icethemselves.   ``We're just getting tired of waiting for things to show up,''said North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll. ``We're gettingaway from the heavy equipment approach.''   Mark Fraker, a whale biologist with Standard Alaska ProductionCo., said rescuers finally were making some progress. ``Up untilnow, we've just been keeping them alive by keeping their breathingholes open.''   Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice towithin four miles of the whales Friday, giving an added urgency tothe effort to free the animals before a shift in the wind couldpinch off the escape routes.   Biologists already were using tarps and aerators to get thetrapped animals away from their breathing holes and condition themto the notion of moving from one hole in the ice to another.   Hope faded Friday that a ``hover-barge'' could be used to breakice to rescue the giant mammals.   Originally, the National Guard planned to use another Skycraneto tow a 185-ton icebreaking barge, floating on a cushion of airgenerated by huge on-board fans, from Prudhoe Bay to Barrow, adistance of 230 miles. But that bogged down in coastal mud, shallowwater, thin ice and sandbars.   Two days of pulling had netted six miles. Helicopter crews setout Friday to try one last time to pull the barge.   The environmental group Greenpeace on Friday said the SovietUnion has offered to break a path to the stranded whales with anicebreaking ship next week if current rescue efforts don't succeed.The ship is 300 miles north of Point Barrow.   Biologists had been getting impatient with the barge effort andpushed for the alternate plan, using the giant concrete punch.   A second concrete cylinder was to be hauled to Barrow later ifthere was no further progress with the barge.   With luck, the animals will follow a series of punched-out holesto open water, if broken ice can be removed from the new holes.   ``The theory is to cut other holes very close, but nottouching,'' said Ted Meyers, National Marine Fisheries Servicehabitat conservation chief for Alaska. ``You cut a new hole closeenough so the whales can see it, sense it and go for it. Once theyhave done that, and are using the new hole, then you start anotherprocess of discouraging use of the older hole.   ``There are different ways. One would be to cover the hole, andthen even the sounds of chainsaws cutting new holes could get theanimals to associate that with new holes. Once you've got themmoving, and this has not been decided in this case, then you couldmove the holes farther apart.''   Carroll said the whales at least once have been coaxed to a newhole.   Skycrane pilot Chief Warrant Officer Gary Quarles experimentedwith one of the concrete cylinders earlier this week. He said thehelicopter would suspend the cylinder about five feet above the iceand quickly descend to drop it through.   ``It has to be very controlled, or it would be very dangerous,''he said.   ``What we're going to attempt to do initially is make fairlylarge holes close together in the hope the whales will go from holeto hole,'' he said. ``We plan on putting holes maybe 20 feet apart.My plan is to start fairly far away from them and let them get usedto the sound rather than starting close and scaring them. We'll doit gradually.''</TEXT></DOC>
