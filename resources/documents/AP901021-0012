Three Israeli Jews, including a police officer, died in astabbing attack Sunday in a Jerusalem neighborhood, army radioreported.   The radio said police apprehended one suspect, but it was notclear if he was an Arab or Jew. According to the radio, theattacker first stabbed to death a woman in her 20s, then ran down amajor street and stabbed two other people, including the policeman.   In the West Bank stabbing death, villagers said Musleh Halaf,50, was kidnapped five days ago by four masked men in the mainstreet of Jenin. Halaf had been appointed a councilman by theIsraeli authorities but had resigned the post, villagers said.   Assuming Halaf was slain as a collaborator, his death raised to282 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs sinceDecember 1987, when the uprising against Israeli rule began. Mostwere killed on suspicion of working with Israeli authorities.   Since the uprising began, 761 Palestinians have been killed byIsraeli soldiers or civilians, and 48 Israelis have died in theviolence.   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, about 100 Israeli women urgedinternational intervention to protect Palestinians in the occupiedterritories.   The protest followed a decision by U.N. chief Javier Perez deCuellar not to send envoys to investigate the killings of at least19 Palestinians in Jerusalem unless Israel changes its mind andcooperates with the panel.   More than 140 Palestinians were also wounded on Oct. 8, whenIsraeli security forces fired on protesters on the Temple Mount.The protesters had thrown rocks at Jews praying at the nearbyWestern Wall. About 30 Israeli police and civilians were injured.   The killings on the Mount, known to Moslems as Haram es-Sharif,were condemned in a resolution passed unanimously by the U.N.Security Council despite Israel's attempts to persuade its chiefally, the United States, to veto it.   The women, dressed in black and holding placards with slogansopposing the Israeli occupation, held a silent vigil across from apolice prison in the center of town.   Police had earlier barred the women from holding their vigil inArab east Jerusalem, saying it could incite violence. One woman wasarrested when she and others began shouting slogans.   ``We have to demand pressure from outside because we've seen adrastic swing to the right inside Israel and our effect is becomingless and less,'' said Judy Green, who moved to Israel 10 years agofrom Little Rock, Ark.   ``Most of us here believe that this occupation is destroyingIsrael and is destroying the morality of Israelis,'' she added.   Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan andEgypt during the 1967 Middle East war.   ``What we are asking for is some kind of odsend from outside toshake this country back into its senses,'' said Ruth Cohen as sheheld a poster reading: ``Down with the Occupation.''</TEXT></DOC>
