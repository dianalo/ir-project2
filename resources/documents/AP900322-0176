Keenan.   The interviews Livingston referred to were excerpts from an NBC``Today Show'' broadcast Tuesday and comments made to severalnewspapers before the trial started.   Livingston gave Keenan the letter during a break in juryselection, now in its third day, and the judge took it underadvisement. By the end of the day Thursday, Keenan had selected 31potential jurors; a final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates isexpected to be chosen next week.   The letter said Gerry Spence, one of the former Philippine firstlady's four attorneys, violated a local rule that prohibits lawyersfrom commenting on pending criminal cases, except to deny thecharges or to quote from documents filed with the court.   Later in the day Thursday, Keenan jokingly brought up the issue.``You're not going to be on `60 Minutes' again?'' he asked Spence,who was profiled on the CBS news show several years ago.   ``It depends on what you're going to do to me,'' Spence said.   Livingston stopped short of requesting a gag order barring anydiscussion of the case. She asked Keenan to remind defense lawyersof their responsibility to abide by the rule.   Spence had no immediate comment on the government's letter. OnWednesday, he told Keenan that he was concerned about negativepublicity.   ``In this country and in this legal system one doesn't become acriminal by sleeping with one's husband,'' Spence was quoted assaying on NBC. ``The ghost of Ferdinand Marcos is everywhere,everywhere in this case.''   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged in the alleged illegal transfer ofmore than $160 million from the Philippine government anddefrauding banking institutions of an additional $165 million. Herhusband, former Philippine president, was named in the originalOctober 1988 indictment, but died in Hawaii last Sept. 28.   Also on trial is Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who is accusedof helping the Marcoses conceal a series of New York real estatedeals allegedly financed in part with money stolen from thePhilippine treasury.</TEXT></DOC>
