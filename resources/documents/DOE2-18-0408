Their size, position,and vascularity make successful surgical reaction impossible. Attemptsat resection produce only temporary relief of symptoms and cause furtherdisfigurement. Large AVMs give rise to pain, swelling, and distal ischaemia,can erode bone, and give rise to life-threatening hemorrhage, and a massiveleft or right shunt causes high-output cardiac failure and death. Tenpatients (age range, 5-50 years; mean 26 years) have massive AVMs givingrise to high-output cardiac failure (26-28 liters). These patients (sevenmale, three female), have undergone a total of 43 embolization procedures.The advent of nonionic contrast media, digital subtraction angiography,steel coils, and balloons allows us to successfully treat these patientswho until recently were condemned to die in high-output cardiac failure.</TEXT></DOC>
