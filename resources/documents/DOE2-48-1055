The authors discuss the useof some of the newer embolic agents, real-time digital subtraction angiography,roadmapping techniques, and the use of microcatheters and steerable microguide wires, which has greatly facilitated neurovascullar embolizationprocedures and enhanced patient safety. A number of actual intraoperativeand intravascular cases will be shown demonstrating treatment of vascularmalformations of the brain and spinal cord, carotid cavernous sinus fistulas,aneurysms and dural arteriovenous malformations. The indications fortreatment, patient selection, technical preparation and newer methodologiesand approaches to complex vascular lesions of the brain and spinal cordare discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
