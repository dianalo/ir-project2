ATandamp;T also posted a 27% gain in operating profit for thequarter and a 12% increase for the year. It said it doesn'texpect the economy to rebound before the end of 1991, butanticipates better sales and earnings in the second half thanin the first half.</LP><TEXT>   Fourth-quarter net income fell 1% to $698 million, or 64cents per share, from $705 million or 65 cents per share inthe same period last year. Revenue increased 7% to $9.96billion compared with $9.31 billion a year ago.   For the year, net grew 1.4% to $2.73 billion, or $2.51 pershare, compared with $2.69 billion, or $2.50 a share for1989. Revenue climbed 3.1% to $37.29 billion from $36.15billion last year.   &quot;We are pleased with these results, achieved in the faceof a deteriorating economy in 1990,&quot; said ATandamp;T ChairmanRobert E. Allen, in a statement released by the company. &quot;Weintend in 1991 to continue to strengthen our business,introducing new technologies, streamlining our operations andimproving our cost structure.&quot;   &quot;They surprised me,&quot; given the recession, said Joel D.Gross, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette SecuritiesCorp., New York. &quot;But I don't think they're out of the woods.There's a good possibility that revenues will slip this yearif the Bell companies and foreign phone companies cut{network} equipment orders in the first half.&quot;   ATandamp;T's stock had a good day yesterday as did those of itslong-distance rivals MCI Communications Corp. and UnitedTelecommunications Inc., which owns US Sprint CommunicationsCo. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, ATandamp;T stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $30.875,and United Telecom shares also rose 37.5 cents to $22.25. MCIstock rose 62.5 cents to $20.625 in national over-the-countertrading.   But Jack B. Grubman, telecommunications analyst atPaineWebber Inc., questioned the market's reaction, giventhat &quot;ATandamp;T is not losing market share in long distance andMCI's and Sprint's volume growth for the first time sinceATandamp;T's breakup will be barely double digits this quarter.That message is clear.&quot;   ATandamp;T's long-distance business continued to strengthen as aresult of increased calling volumes -- up 8% in the quarterand 7.5% for the year compared with 6.6% and 6.3%,respectively, during the same periods last year. However,revenue rose a measly 1.8% in the quarter to $4.98 billionand 0.8% to $19.69 billion for the year as customerscontinued to favor ATandamp;T's cheaper service offerings.   Phone network equipment revenues grew 12.4% in the quarterto $2.1 billion, led mainly by international sales, whichjumped 40% to $1.5 billion. Office communications andcomputer equipment grew 9.5% to $1.06 billion in the quarter.ATandamp;T, which has been fighting to acquire NCR Corp., doesn'tdisclose income from its computer business, which analystsestimate is losing more than $100 million a year.   But costs in ATandamp;T's financial services sector more thantripled in the quarter as its credit card, the UniversalCard, continued to suffer from too much success. Overall,though, it appears financial services, including ATandamp;T'sleasing business ATandamp;T Capital Corp., will be a major futurecontributor, given that revenues grew more than 2 1/2 timesin the quarter and doubled for the year.   ATandamp;T's operating profit was $1.21 billion for the quartercompared with $952 million a year ago and $4.83 billionversus $4.3 billion for the year.   However, this was offset by lower &quot;other income,&quot; whichdropped almost 74% in the quarter alone; interest expenses of$237 million, a 49% increase over last year's period; and ahigher tax rate. In addition, ATandamp;T's per-share results fellby a penny in the quarter as a result of a larger number ofshares outstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
