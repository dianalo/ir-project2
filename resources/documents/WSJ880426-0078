Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal bank regulators are considering asking Congress for greater leverage over failing bank holding companies and their creditors, government officials said.    William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., wants to seek legislative authority to force strong and weak bank subsidiaries of a struggling bank holding company to merge, according to an FDIC official. Other federal bank regulators have discussed the concept and are supportive of it, government officials said.    One major goal, officials said, is to weaken the position of a multibank holding company's debt holders, who currently can make claims against its healthy subsidiaries even if most of its subsidiaries fail. Another is to prevent a holding company from dumping bad assets from its stronger banks into a failing subsidiary and letting regulators take it over.    By some accounts, the initiative stems from regulators' embarrassment that for weeks, creditors of First City Bancorp. of Texas held up its federally assisted sale to an investor group led by A. Robert Abboud.    That sale went through last week, but only after Mr. Abboud retreated from his demand that 90% of Houston-based First City's long-term debt be retired at 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar -- he ultimately accepted about 67.5% of the debt -- and after the FDIC softened some of its terms.    Many debt holders shrugged off the FDIC's threat to allow First City's banks to fail. At first, FDIC officials suggested that would leave creditors empty-handed. But that came to look unlikely, as First City had some healthy banks, and regulators can close only insolvent banks. If they had taken over the sick banks, creditors -- many of them arbitragers who saw an opportunity for profit -- could have pursued claims against the solvent ones.    The proposal would affect shareholders as well as creditors and might prevent some failures, one official said. In one case, he said, a bank holding company tried to guard the resources of its large bank subsidiary while letting a small bank subsidiary fail without help. Under the proposal, regulators could force the holding company to combine the two banks if that would prevent the failure.    Michael Bradfield, general counsel of the Federal Reserve Board, said the FDIC proposal would give the Fed stronger weapons to enforce its current policy that &quot;the bank holding company's good assets ought to be marshaled to support its troubled assets.&quot;    Some constitutional concerns about a possible unjust taking of property have been raised, however. Officials are considering guaranteeing the appraised value of the solvent companies to parties that held debt before the proposal became law. That would cut out speculators who bought such debt after enactment.    The proposal's impact would be strongest on states that have restricted bank branching, such as Texas, where multiple bank subsidiaries perform much like branches of a single bank.    It isn't clear whether it would have much effect on shaky First RepublicBank Corp., Dallas, which the FDIC hopes to sell with some assistance. </TEXT></DOC>
