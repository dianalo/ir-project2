Gorbachev.   Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said the government is planningto cut the $192 billion deficit in half by raising $83 billion innew revenues and trimming expenditures by $10.3 billion.   He told the opening of the fall session of the Supreme Sovietlegislature that military spending could be cut because the SovietUnion's ``realistic and constructive foreign policy'' had led to animprovement in international relations.   The decision to cut military spending from $119 billion to $109billion is in keeping with a directive from the Congress ofPeople's Deputies parliament to cut military spending by 14 percentby 1991, Pavlov said.   Military research alone will be cut by $3.4 billion, he said.   Officials say the 1990 budget is of an ``emergency character''because of the deficit that has spun out of control as thecountry's economic situation worsens. The budget deficit is onlythe second the Soviet government has acknowledged.   The finance minister said the government was planning to raisepensions for 60 million retirees by an average of 15 percent andreorient the Soviet economy toward fulfilling social needs.   Pavlov did not immediately say how the government would raisethe extra money.   Earlier in the day, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet that thegovernment will take firm steps to settle the ethnic dispute overNagorno-Karabakh if Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot end it quickly.   ``If the situation doesn't stabilize, I think our government,along with the republics, will have to take concrete steps,''Gorbachev said over the dispute over the autonomous region ofNagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.   Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighboring southern Sovietrepublics, have been locked in a bitter 19-month dispute overcontrol of the enclave. About 100 people have died in the ethnicconflict.   An economic blockade of mainly Christian Armenia, which receivesmore than 80 percent of its food and fuel via predominantly MoslemAzerbaijan, has left shelves bare and industry at a virtualstandstill.   Gorbachev did not say what measures he had in mind, but inreplying to legislators' questions Gorbachev indicated that hewanted the problem resolved within days.   Located in the Caucasus Mountains in the southern Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh's area is 1,760 square miles,slightly smaller than Delaware. The 1979 Soviet census putNagorno-Karabakh's population at 162,000, of which 76 percent wereethnic Armenians and 23 percent ethnic Azerbaijanis. UnderGorbachev, the Supreme Soviet has been transformed from a rubberstamp for Communist Party directives into a lively forum for debate.   The current body, chosen after spring elections that gave Sovietvoters their first choice among candidates in seven decades, isscheduled to sit for two months.   It has about 80 items on its agenda, including the matter ofgranting economic sovereignty for several of the country's 15republics and methods for settling labor disputes, the officialTass news agency said.   The body will devote Mondays and Tuesdays to general sessionsand the rest of each week to committee meetings.   In its first session as a competitively elected body, the542-member Supreme Soviet held confirmation hearings onCabinet-level jobs and forced the withdrawal of several candidatesput forward by the government.   On the agenda now are calls by the Congress of People'sDeputies' first organized opposition group to permit people to owntheir own land, establish market pricing, permit independenttelevision broadcasting and allow Soviets to move freely withintheir country.   Soviets must now carry internal passports and obtain permissionto move into desired urban areas such as Moscow, and the governmentstill denies external passports to many citizens.   The group of 345 reform-minded deputies of the 2,250-memberCongress, known as the Inter-Regional Group, includes such SupremeSoviet legislators as political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and humanrights activist Andrei Sakharov.   The Supreme Soviet is made up of full-time legislators electedby the Congress, which meets at least once a year and was chosen inspring elections.   The Inter-Regional Group is calling for legalization of privateproperty, and the introduction of market pricing. Gorbachev'sadvisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices.But in the face of strong public objection to lifting governmentsubsidies, the government has promised to delay the proposal forseveral years.   The opposition group proposes that the vast industrialministries, which now control the supplies and decisions of mostfactories in the country, be replaced with small commissions ofexperts in the field.   The group also wants ``an end to the government monopoly ontelevision.''</TEXT></DOC>
