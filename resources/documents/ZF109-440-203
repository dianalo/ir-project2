 TheSCATsx chip supports 16, 20 and 25 MHz microprocessors with a cost-effectiveAT-compatible systems logic solution.andP;  The SCATsx chip is a second generationdevelopment of CHIPS' 82C235 Single Chip AT (SCAT) 80286 microprocessorcontroller announced in October 1989 and now shipping in volume to customersworldwide.andM;The SCATsx system controller is the foundation of a series of systemsolutions offered by CHIPS.andP;  These include:andM;THE ELEATSX SYSTEM SOLUTION The Entry-Level Enhanced AT 80386sx CHIPSet is anintegrated three chip desktop CHIPSet consisting of the SCATsx systems logiccontroller, the 82C450 1 Megabit DRAM VGA controller, and the 82C711Universal Peripheral Controller which integrates two serial ports and oneparallel port with a floppy disk controller and hard disk drive interface ona single chip.andM;The ELEATsx CHIPSet is managed by the CHIPS ELEATsx BIOS, a unique firmwareapproach supporting both video and systems logic with a single integratedsolution resident on one memory device.andM;The ELEATsx CHIPSet provides OEMs with the silicon and firmware elementsrequired to build high volume 80386sx desktop computers which integrate allsystems logic, graphics, mass storage interface and data input/ouputcapability on a two layer printed circuit motherboard.andM;Using ELEATsx, a manufacturer can build a complete system using less than 30integrated circuits plus memory.andM;THE PEAKSX HIGH PERFORMANCE 80386SX CHIPSET The PEAKsx CHIPSet is a two chipcache-based solution for 20 MHz and 25 MHz 80386sx microprocessor-basedsystems.andP;  The PEAKsx systems logic solution consists of the SCATsx chip plusthe 82C835 cache controller.andP;  With the PEAKsx CHIPSet, OEMs can build 20 MHz80386sx personal computers which provide performance equal to, or exceeding,non-cache 25 MHz 80386DX microprocessor-based systems.andM;A PEAKsx CHIPSet based system requires seven integrated circuits plus memory.andO;With PEAKsx based solutions, OEMs create new price performance points in theindustry.andM;A complete PEAKsx-based PC can be designed by incorporating the 82C450 VGAcontroller and the 82C711 Universal Peripheral Controller to create a lowcost, high performance system.andP;  The PEAKsx CHIPSet is also fully supported byCHIPS' Super VGA controllers, data I/O, SCSI and BIOS solutions.andM;THE CHIPSLITE FAMILY OF INTEGRATED NOTEBOOK CHIPSETS The CHIPSlite family ofnotebook CHIPSets is a second generation notebook solution.andP;  CHIPSlite isdesigned to offer OEMs the ability to design a wide range of portablecomputer products with a common power management architecture.andM;CHIPSlite products can range from 80286-based mass market machines tohigh-end 80386sx notebooks which replicate the functionality of a desktoppersonal computer.andM;For high-end designs, the CHIPSlite/sx CHIPSet incorporates SCATsx plus theadvanced 82C641 Power Control Unit, the 82C456 VGA controller, the 82C711Universal Peripheral Controller, and CHIPSlite BIOS.andM;For more cost sensitive designs, CHIPS offers the CHIPSlite/286 CHIPSetconsisting of the SCAT system logic controller chip plus the 82C641 PowerControl Unit, the 82C455 VGA controller and/or the 82C426 CGA flat panelcontroller.andP;  The 82C710 Multi Function Controller - which integrates oneserial and one parallel port, a mouse port and a floppy disk controller onone chip - is an integral part of the CHIPSlite/286 solution.andM;Key to all the CHIPSlite CHIPSets is CHIPS' advanced power managementsolutions.andP;  The CHPSlite BIOS and 82C641 Power Control Unit support powermanagement features such as SMARTSLEEP, CAS before RAS DRAM re-fresh,programmable microprocessor clocking, and other advanced features.andM;CHIPSCLOCK INTEGRATED SYSTEM OSCILATORS To maximize integration of allgraphics sub-systems -- both desktop and notebook -- CHIPS announced theCHIPSclock family, a new line of integrated oscilator chips which eliminatesup to six oscilators and 20 passive components currently required fordesigning graphics subsystems.andM;The CHIPSClock family is designed to closely couple with CHIPS' wide range ofPC-compatible graphics controllers.andP;  The CHIPSClock family consists of the82C401 which supports the 82C451 VGA controller and the 82C455 and 82C456flat panel display VGA controllers: the 82C402 tailored to the 82C450 and82C452 VGA controllers, and the 82C403 which supports the 82C4808514/A-compatible graphics contoller.andM;THE 82C5086 SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEMS INTERFACE PROTOCOL CONTROLLER The 82C5086SCSI solution is a single chip device for adding high performance SCSIinput/output capability to both notebook and motherboard designs.andP;  With the82C5086, up to eight peripheral devices can be interfaced through a singlebus with data transfer rates of 5.3 Mbytes/sec.andP;  The 82C5086 directlyconnects to the AT bus with no external logic required and fully supports theSCSI-2 standard.andM;The ELEATsx, PEAKsx, and CHIPSlite CHIPSets are all scheduled to sample inOctober with production quantities available in the first quarter of 1991.andO;In quantities of 1000, the ELEATsx CHIPSet sells for $68 per CHIPSet; thePEAKsx CHIPSet sells for $59; and CHIPSlite CHIPSets range in price dependingon configuration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
