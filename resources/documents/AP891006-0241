Britain is the most vulnerable nation to economic and politicalrepercussions from the decision Thursday by European governments toraise their interest rates to combat inflation and stabilize theircurrencies.   The upward move was led by West Germany, which raised its keyrates an unexpected full percentage point.   The British government responded by raising rates a full pointas well, to 15 percent, their highest in nearly eight years. It wasa politically risky move to defend the pound.   Other European central banks, including those of France,Switzerland, and Austria, moved their rates up as well to easedownward pressure on their currencies and keep them within tradingranges imposed by the European Monetary System, which links thecurrencies of most Common Market nations in order to minimize rateswings. Britain doesn't participate.   The dollar finished higher anyway on Thursday, but Europeanstock markets were unsettled.   The dollar closed at 1.8845 West German marks, up from 1.8770marks on Wednesday, and the Financial Times-Stock Exchange100-share index of the British exchange fell 30.5 points, or 1.3percent, to close at 2,281.6.   The previous tandem interest rate increase took place in lateJune. The markets had been watching a Thursday meeting of the WestGerman central bank's council for a possible rise, but many werestunned by its size.   The increases ``could be dangerous to the economy and could betoo high,'' said Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank inFrankfurt.   John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of BritishIndustry, called them ``wholly unnecessary.''   ``High interest rates have done their job by curbing overheatingin the economy, and this further rise will be counterproductive,''he said.   British lawmaker John Smith, the opposition Labor Party'sspokesman on trade, said: ``This is appalling news. For millions ofmortgage payers and for businesses all over Britain living costswill rise and investment will become even more expensive.''   The Bundesbank raised its discount rate, the rate at which acommercial bank can borrow funds from the central bank, from 5percent to 6 percent and pushed up its Lombard rate from 7 percentto 8 percent.   The Lombard rate is the rate at which the central bank lendsfunds using securities as collateral.   The last time the Bundesbank raised key rates by more than halfa point was in February 1980.   The West German government bank said the increases were designed``to combat continued inflationary danger resulting from anexuberant economy.'' It also said they were aimed at stabilizingthe mark.   West Germany's economy is growing at a rate of 4.5 percentcompared with the previous 2 percent, and inflation is at 3percent, said David Morrison, an economist at Goldman SachsInternational Corp. in London.   He speculated that West Germany wanted to get interest rateincreases out of the way well before a 1990 national election.   ``This probably reflects a peak for interest rates,'' he said.   But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, theCabinet member responsible for national finances, said on BritishBroadcasting Corp. television that he couldn't promise thatBritain's rates wouldn't go even higher.   Soon after the German move, the Bank of England signaled thefull percentage point increase in the British commercial banks'base rates to the 15 percent level, the 11th increase since June1988, when rates stood at a decade low of 7.5 percent.   Britain has the highest interest rates among the major Westerndemocracies.   Britain's Treasury said the European rate hikes reflected ``ageneral concern to take no risks on inflation.''   Lawson told BBC radio that with his Conservative Party openingits annual convention Monday, the increase was ``extremelyawkward.'' But he said, ``It's necessary to do the right thing.''   British markets had expected a rate increase since poor tradefigures were announced last week, pressuring the pound. The Bank ofEngland has since intervened in currency trading repeatedly tosupport the pound.   Lawson has maintained that a strong pound is essential to thegovernment's fight against inflation, whose annual rate stood at7.3 percent in August, down from 8.2 percent in July but more thandouble the 3.3 percent in January 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
