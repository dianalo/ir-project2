Youfocused on a few addicted smokers and one &quot;smokers' rights&quot;activist funded by the tobacco industry, but failed tomention that 455 million people fly each year in the U.S.,the vast majority of whom are thrilled with the new law.   The measure has been a huge success since it went intoeffect on Feb. 25, surpassing even its proponents' greatestexpectations. The almost complete lack of news about thepublic's adjustment to the new law is a sign of its warmwelcome. Thus, by focusing on three or four of the millionsof smokers and nonsmokers who have enjoyed your article, youdrew an inaccurate picture of what has occurred.</LP><TEXT>   Fran Du Melle   Coalition on Smoking OR Health   Washington   ---   So the government has banned smoking on domestic flights,and passengers are sneaking smokes in the bathroom. Is anyonesurprised? Sooner or later, there will be a bathroom fire, aplane crash and many deaths.   Will the government then admit its mistake and restore thesmoking section as the lesser risk? Of course not. Thegovernment will ban bathrooms.   Norma S. Hass   Sleepy Hollow, Ill.   ---   The current intolerant attitude of many Americans towardsmokers shows with chilling clarity how easily a goodpropaganda campaign can create socially acceptable hatred ofa minority. As the harassment, bullying and mistreatmentescalate, it should surprise no one that more and moresmokers are reacting angrily and impolitely.   The federal law banning smoking on flights of less thansix hours is an excellent example of unnecessary governmentaction that causes more problems than it solves. Decisionsregarding smoking should have been left to the individualairlines. The marketplace would have decided the issuepeacefully and efficiently. Why was it not allowed to do so?   David V. Walden   Chicago   ---   I am sorry that smokers are trapped between theiraddictions and the regulations, but like many nonsmokers, theregulations mean that finally I am able to enjoy traveling.No longer do I get nauseated just at the thought of boardingan airplane. No longer do I arrive at my destination feelingslimed by smokers sitting 20 rows behind me. No longer doesmy wife make me shower and change my clothes the moment Iwalk in the door from a trip.
