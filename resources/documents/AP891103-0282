General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. saidthey sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 32,302during the Oct. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of34,334 during the same time last year.   Late-October car sales were 6.6 percent lower than last year andlight truck sales were down 4.89 percent.   The companies' vehicle sales between Oct. 1, when the 1990 modelyear technically started, and Oct. 31, ran 14.1 percent behind lastyear's pace.   An October decline had been anticipated, and there waswidespread speculation during the summer that much of the salesslide would come from customers who had planned to buy cars inOctober but instead bought their vehicles earlier to avoid1990-model price increases.   Also, incentives continued in October, but not at the same levelas during the two previous months.   Through the first 10 months of this year, car and truck sales bythe Big Three averaged 34,867 a day, 3.9 percent lower than thedaily rate of 36,265 during the same period last year.
