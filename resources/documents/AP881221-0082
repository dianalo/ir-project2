Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil told reporters that thesituation has been brought under control. He gave no other details.   Khalil was confirming a report in the newspaper Al-Siyassa.   The independent paper reported that security men had crushed anattempted coup on Saturday and arrested 25 retired military officersand civilian officials from the former government of PresidentGaafar Nimeiri, who was ousted in an April 6, 1985, coup. It was thethird newspaper report of an attempted coup in Sudan in the past twoweeks.   After the Al-Siyassa report appeared today, about 300demonstrators defied an emergency order and gathered in Khartoum'sLiberty square to demand government approval of a tentativeagreement to stop Sudan's civil war.   The demonstrators in Khartoum's Liberty Square also ignored adecision by rally organizers to call off the protest because Mahdi'sgovernment declared a special emergency in the Khartoum area.   Mohammed Osman Mirghani, spiritual leader of the DemocraticUnionist Party and the negotiator of the peace agreement with rebelleader John Garang, reportedly urged that the peace march bepostponed.   Garang, head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, began hiscivil rebellion in early 1983 to press demands for what he considersfairer economic, political and administrative treatment for southernSudan.   Mirghani told demonstration organizers that ``new developments inthe picture'' made a postponement of the rally necessary ``in theinterests of peace,'' the independent newspaper Al-Ayam reported.   Riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square asprotestors chanted ``No, no to war'' and ``Yes, yes to peace.''   Witnesses said police confiscated several placards before thedemonstration began but did not intervene at the gathering itself.   An officer told the gathering through a bullhorn that thedemonstration was called off and that people should disperse.   The crowd finally broke up only after they were asked to leave byAbbas Awad, a member of the organizing committee representing 54political parties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement.   ``We have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizingdemocracy in the country and that the demonstration of today wouldhave been used as a springboard for this purpose,'' Abbas told thecrowd.   Interviewed later, he said the Democratic Unionists canceled thedemonstration because a ``group was planning to counter (it) ... tospread chaos so that the army would intervene.''   The Nov. 16 agreement calls for a cease-fire, a conference tonegotiate a permanent peace and to draft a new constitution and afreeze on implementing Sudan's Islam-based legal code.   It has caused deep splits in Mahdi's government. Mirghani'sparty, junior partner in the coalition behind the premier's Umma,wants the government officially to approve the pact. Mahdi refusesto submit it for discussion, partly because to do so would drive outthe coalition's third major party, the fundamentalist NationalIslamic Front.</TEXT></DOC>
