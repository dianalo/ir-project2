(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker assured hisfollowers he ``would not lie to you about anything'' in excerpts ofhis television shows viewed Tuesday by jurors at his fraud trial.   The jury is being shown eight hours culled from broadcasts ofBakker's ``PTL Show,'' much of it dealing with ``lifetimepartnerships.'' Followers were asked to buy $1,000 partnerships,guaranteeing three nights' lodging a year for life at PTL's HeritageUSA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C.   ``I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' Bakkertold viewers in one excerpt. ``Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle Samjust took everything we could scrape together. Next month will be alittle better for me.''   In a 1984 videotape, Bakker urged his audience to pay forpartnerships with a credit card, saying he bought his with a creditcard because he didn't have any cash. That same year, prosecutorssaid, Bakker received $1 million in salary and bonuses and bought aPalm Desert, Calif., home and a Rolls-Royce.   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTLmoney raised from ``lifetime partnership'' sales to pay for personalluxuries. If found guilty of the 24 counts against him, Bakker couldbe sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million.   The jury saw about six hours of the videotapes on Tuesday, andwere expected to begin viewing more of the tapes on Wednesday, afterwhich the prosecution is expected to rest its case.   In a December 1984 videotape, Bakker was shown saying, `If I eversee anyone at this place robbing or stealing, they are going tojail,'' to which someone in the courtroom audience shouted ``Amen.''   In another broadcast, Bakker complained that more than 900 peoplehad used invalid credit cards or bad checks to buy partnerships.Bakker reopened partnership sales in the Heritage Grand Hotel atHeritage USA.   ``Some people's credit cards did not go through and some people'schecks went through and through and through again. They bounced fromhere to California,'' Bakker said.   PTL also sold partnerships for another hotel at Heritage USA,Towers Hotel. Sales were reopened in 1986, even though investigatorssay more than 30,000 partnerships in the Towers Hotel already hadbeen sold. Bakker told viewers he had $8 million in unpaid bills onthe Towers.   ``I'm going to give something that's the best bargain in theworld,'' Bakker said on a show recorded May 31, 1986. ``When you'redesperate, you do desperate things.''   Witnesses called earlier in the trial have testified they boughtthe partnerships but could not get rooms. Others have testified thatpartnerships were oversold and that the money from such promotionsoften was used to cover PTL's day-to-day operating costs rather thanfinance construction of the guaranteed rooms and buildings.   FBI agent John Pearson, who produced the tape, said more than66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time Bakker left PTLin March 1987, despite a publicized limit of 25,000.</TEXT></DOC>
