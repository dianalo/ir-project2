About 8,000 riot police blanketed the downtown area in a majorshow of strength to block a demonstration called by strikingworkers and dissidents to denounce the government of President RohTae-woo.   Squads of police in green fatigues, visored helmets and armedwith shields and nightsticks patrolled the streets, dispersingonlookers and keeping the area clear. Police vehicles roamed thestreets, and squads of troopers were at every major intersection.   Officials said 433 students and workers were arrested afterbeing detained during street checks. Roadblocks turned back about800 people trying to reach the rally site.   About 50 radical students yelling anti-government slogans stageda brief protest in the city center but fled as soon as riot policearrived.   ``They talk big, but they don't dare come out,'' said a grinningofficer.   Dissident leaders said they expected up to 50,000 people wouldparticipate in the rally in this industrial port city 120 milessoutheast of Seoul.   But the enormous display of police strength frightened workers,and no one was prepared to come onto the streets, they said. ``Howcan we march for our rights when there are so many police?'' saidone protest leader.   Workers unable to march because of the police presence stagedsit-down protests at factories. The sit-ins were peaceful, andwitnesses said there were no confrontations with police.   In Seoul, a 24-year-old union leader at a garment factory dousedhimself with kerosene and set himself on fire today to protest poorworking conditions, news reports said. He was hospitalized incritical condition along with a second worker whose clothesaccidently caught fire.   The radicals are calling for the overthrow of the Rohgovernment, but they have little public support because of theirviolent tactics and extreme views. However, the government isconcerned about their efforts to build an anti-government alliancewith striking workers.   Many riot troopers in Masan wore black ribbons of mourning fortheir six comrades who were killed Wednesday in the nearby city ofPusan during an attempt to free five police officers held hostageby radical college students.   The hostages were freed later.   Roh warned he would invoke emergency powers to halt violentanti-government protests and strikes that have hit South Korea inrecent months.   The police deaths shocked South Koreans and brought calls fromboth government and opposition leaders for an end to violentprotests. It was the worst loss of life related to politicalviolence since a 1980 anti-government uprising in Kwangju left atleast 192 people dead.   Police said today that they would charge five student leaderswith murder and arson, charges which could be punishable by death.Police said lesser charges would be filed against 40 other students.   Also today, the governing and opposition parties agreed to enacta law against firebombs.   In Seoul, hundreds of radical students shouting ``Down with theRoh regime'' marched on at least three campuses. But the studentsavoided clashes with riot police stationed outside, apparentlysensing public anger at the killing of police officers in Pusan.   ``We will go ahead with our anti-Roh campaign, but this time wethink we have to restrain ourselves,'' a student leader said.   Government leaders say strikes have already cost the economymore than $3 billion in lost production this year.   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in December1987, after rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote. Hehas helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but the radicalsclaim the government is a front for military rule and assert therehave been no reforms.   Also today, about 500 farmers and students staged a peacefulprotest march in downtown Chonan, 40 miles south of Seoul, toprotest U.S. agricultural imports, according to Yonhap, the SouthKorean news agency.   Another 700 students shouting ``Drive out Yankees!'' battledriot police with firebombs and rocks in the central city of Taejonto oppose the reported move of U.S. bases from Seoul to Taejon.   The South Korean Defense Ministry announced Tuesday the UnitedStates has agreed to relocate U.S. barracks in Seoul by themid-1990s. News reports said they would be moved to areas aroundTaejon.   Radical students have demanded withdrawal of the 43,000 Americantroops stationed in South Korea, contending the soldiers hamperunification with communist North Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
