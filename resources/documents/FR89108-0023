Copies of comments should also be sent to the Internal RevenueService at the address previously specified.The collections of information in this regulation are in 26 CFR 1.74-1(c).This information is required by the Internal Revenue Service in order toverify that the proper amount of income is reported by taxpayers on theirreturns of tax. The likely respondents are individuals.Estimated total annual reporting burden: 1,275 hours.Estimated average annual burden per respondent: 15 minutes.Estimated number of respondents: 5,100.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations(26 CFR Part 1) under sections 74, 102, and 274 of the Internal RevenueCode (Code). The amendments are proposed to conform the regulations tosection 122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514). The proposedamendments, if adopted, will be issued under the authority contained insection 7805 of the Code (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805).<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information</ITAG>Prior to the 1986 Code, section 74 stated that prizes and awards, otherthan certain types of fellowship grants and scholarships, were includiblein gross income unless they were made primarily in recognition of religious,charitable, scientific, educational, artistic, literary, or civic achievement.To qualify for the exclusion, the recipient must have been selected withoutany action on his part and could not be required to render substantialservices as a condition to receiving the prize or award.Within the context of a business relationship, prizes and awards that wouldotherwise be includible in a recipient's gross income were excludable ifthey qualified as gifts under section 102. In general, section 274(b) disallowedan employer a business deduction for gifts to an employee to the extentthat the total cost of all gifts of cash, tangible personal property, andother items to the same individual during the taxable year exceeded $25.A special exception to the $25 limitation was allowed for items of tangiblepersonal property awarded to an employee for length of service, safetyachievement, or productivity. The employer could deduct the cost of suchan award up to $400. If the item was provided under a qualified award plan,the deductibility limitation was increased to $1600, provided the averagecost of all plan awards made during the year did not exceed $400. A deminimis fringe benefit under section 132(e) was, and continues to be, excludablefrom gross income and is not subject to the requirements imposed upon prizesand awards under sections 74 and 274.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>These proposed amendments relate to the excludability of certain prizesand awards and to the deductibility of certain employee awards and reflectthe substantial changes made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the Act) tosections 74, 102 and 274 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Changes tothe applicable sections of the Code and regulations, amended or newly incorporatedby this document, are effective for awards made after December 31, 1986.Under the Act, the section 74(b) exclusion for prizes or awards receivedin recognition of charitable achievement is available only if the payortransfers the prize or award to one or more entities described in paragraph(1) and/or (2) of section 170(c), pursuant to the direction of the recipient.Section 1.74-1(c) of the proposed regulations requires that recipientsof prizes and awards clearly designate, in writing, within 45 days of thedate the item is granted that they wish to have the prize or award transferredto one or more qualifying donee organizations. The proposed regulationsset forth requirements which, in certain instances, determine whether aqualifying designation has been made.Section 1.74-1(d) of the proposed regulations clarifies that the exclusionunder section 74(b) will not be available unless the prize or award istransferred by the payor to one or more qualified donee organizations beforethe recipient, or any person other than the grantor or a qualified doneeorganization, uses the item. In general, a transfer may be accomplishedby any method that results in receipt of the prize or award by, or on behalfof, one or more qualified donee organizations.Section 1.74-1(e) further clarifies the requirements of section 74(b) bydefining certain terms. Definitions are included which determine what constitutesa ``qualified donee organization,'' when a ``disqualifying use'' has takenplace, and when an item is considered ``granted.''Section 1.74-1(f) provides that neither the payor nor the recipient ofthe prize or award may claim a charitable contribution deduction for thevalue of any prize or award for which an exclusion is allowed under section74(b).All of the requirements of section 74(b) in existence prior to passageof the Act remain in effect and must be met in order for the award recipientto be eligible for the exclusion. Accordingly, rules and regulations governingthese additional requirements, to the extent they are not inconsistentwith the proposed regulations, will remain in effect.New Code section 74(c) excludes certain employee achievement awards fromgross income. The exclusion applies, subject to certain limitations, tothe value of awards made by the employer for safety achievement or lengthof service achievement. The amount of the exclusion generally correspondswith the deduction given the employer under new section 274(j) for these``employee achievement awards.'' Thus, in general, the employee must includethese awards in income to the extent that the fair market value of theaward, or, if greater, the cost of the award to the employer, exceeds theamount deductible under section 274(j). The exclusion allows an employeeto exclude the full fair market value of the award where the cost of theaward is fully deductible by the employer.Section 1.74-2(d) of the proposed regulations provides special rules foremployee achievement awards applicable to sole-proprietors and tax-exemptemployers.Section 1.74-2(e) clarifies that an employee award, whether or not an employeeachievement award, may be excludible from gross income as a de minimisfringe benefit under section 132(e).Section 102(c) of the Code clarifies that, with the exception of employeeachievement awards under section 74(c) and de minimis fringe benefits undersection 132(e), an employee shall not exclude from gross income any amounttransferred to the employee (or for the employee's benefit) by, or on behalfof, the employer in the form of a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance.Therefore, while awards satisfying the requirements of section 74(c) andde minimis fringe benefits qualifying under section 132(e) will be excludedfrom gross income under those sections, no amounts (except in certain narrowlydefined circumstances) transferred by, or on behalf of, an individual'semployer will be excludable from gross income under section 102.Section 1.102-1(f)(2) of the proposed regulations provides that for purposesof section 102(c), extraordinary transfers to the natural objects of one'sbounty will not be considered transfers for the benefit of an employeeif it can be shown that the transfer was not made in recognition of thetransferee's employment. Thus, the rules set out in <T3>Comm. </T3>v. <T3>Duberstein, </T3>363 U.S. 278 (1960), formerly applicable in the determinationof whether all property transferred inter-vivos from an employer to anemployee constitutes a gift, will only be applicable where the transfereeemployee would be the natural object of the employer's bounty.From an employer's perspective, the Act substantially modifies an employer'sability to deduct the cost of certain employee awards. New section 274(j)defines deductible ``employee achievement awards'' to include only thoseawards made for length of service or safety achievement. In addition, anemployee achievement award must be an item of tangible personal propertyawarded as part of a meaningful presentation and made under conditionsand circumstances that do not create a significant likelihood of the paymentof disguised compensation.  Section 274(j) also establishes a limit on the amount that may be deductedby an employer. The annual deduction limitation per employee is $400 foremployee achievement awards that are not awarded as part of a qualifiedaward plan. The annual deduction limitation per employee is $1,600 foremployee achievement awards that are awarded as part of a qualified awardplan. In no event may an employer deduct more than $1,600 per employeefor all employee achievement awards made during the year. An award is nota qualified plan award where the average cost of all employee achievementawards made by the employer pursuant to a plan exceeds $400 during thetaxable year.  Section 1.274-8(b) of the proposed regulations clarifies that the $1,600deduction limitation applies in the aggregate, so that the $1,600 limitationfor qualified plan awards and the $400 limitation for employee achievementawards that are not qualified plan awards cannot be added together to allowdeductions exceeding $1,600 for employee achievement awards made to anemployee in a taxable year.  Section 1.274-8(c)(2) of the proposed regulations provides that tangiblepersonal property does not include cash or any gift certificate other thana nonnegotiable gift certificate conferring only the right to receive tangiblepersonal property. The proposed regulations also give examples of whatwill be considered to create a significant likelihood of the payment ofdisguised compensation. For example, the providing of employee achievementawards in a manner that discriminates in favor of highly paid employeeswill be considered to be a payment of disguised compensation.  Section 1.274-8(c)(5) of the proposed regulations defines a ``qualifiedplan award'' as an employee achievement award presented pursuant to anestablished written award plan or program of the employer that does notdiscriminate as to eligibility or benefits.  Section 1.274-8(d)(1) of the proposed regulations states that the deductionlimitations shall apply to a partnership as well as to each member of thepartnership. Paragraph (d)(2) provides that the cost of length of serviceachievement awards (other than awards excludable under section 132(e))may only be deducted by the employer if the employee has at least 5 yearsof service with the employer and has not received a length of service achievementaward during that year or any of the 4 prior years. In addition, this paragraphclarifies that although a retirement award will be treated as having beenprovided for length of service achievement, it may also qualify for treatmentas a de minimis fringe benefit under section 132(e) of the Code. Paragraph(d)(3) provides guidance with respect to safety achievement awards. Anemployer may deduct the cost of safety achievement awards only when presentedto no more than 10 percent of an employer's eligible employees. Eligibleemployees include any employee who has worked for the employer in fulltime capacity for at least one year and who is not a manager, administrator,clerical employee, or other professional employee. Special rules clarifythat in the case where more than 10 percent of an employer's eligible employeesreceive a safety achievement award, no award will be considered to be awardedfor safety achievement if it cannot be determined that the award was presentedbefore the 10 percent limitation was exceeded.  The Act specifically excludes awards qualifying as de minimis fringe benefitsunder section 132(e) from the requirements for length of service achievementand safety achievement. As a result, employers are not required to considersection 132(e) awards in determining whether employee achievement awardscomply with the 5 year limitations for length of service achievement andthe 10 percent eligible employee limitations for safety achievement.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses  </ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this proposedrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Accordingly,a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. The Internal Revenue Servicehas concluded that although this document is a notice of proposed rulemakingthat solicits public comment, the regulations proposed herein are interpretativeand the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do notapply. Accordingly, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required forthis rule.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments And Requests For a Public Hearing  </ITAG>Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) tothe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available forpublic inspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon writtenrequest to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted written comments.If a public hearing is held, notice of time and place will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information  </ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is Christopher J. Wilson,formerly of the Legislation and Regulations Division of the Office of ChiefCounsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other officesof the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated indeveloping the regulations, on matters of both substance and style.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR Parts 1.61-1 Through 1.281-4  </ITAG>Income taxes, Taxable income, Deductions, Exemptions.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendments to The Regulations  </ITAG>The proposed amendments to 26 CFR Part 1 are as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1_[AMENDED]  </ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 1 continues to read in part:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 26 U.S.C. 7805. * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.74-1  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]  </ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>Section 1.74-1 is amended as follows:  (a) Paragraph (a)(1) is amended by_  (1) Removing the phrase ``subsection (b)'' and adding the phrase ``subsections(b) and (c)'' in its place, and  (2) Removing the word ``any'' in the last sentence and adding the word``most'' in its place.

(c) <T3>Designation by recipient</T3>._(1) <T3>In general.</T3> To qualify for the exclusion under this section, therecipient must make a qualifying designation, in writing, within 45 daysof the date the prize or award is granted (see paragraph (e)(3) of thissection for a definition of ``granted''). A qualifying designation is requiredto indicate only that a designation is being made. The document does notneed to state on its face that the organization(s) are entities describedin paragraph (1) and/or (2) of section 170(c) to result in a qualifieddesignation. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the document do morethan identify a class of entities from which the payor may select a recipient.However, designation of a specific nonqualified donee organization or designationof a class of recipients that may include nonqualified donee organizationsis not a qualified designation. The following example illustrates the applicationof this section: <ITAG tagnum="21">A distinguished ophthamologist, S, is awarded the Nobel prize formedicine. S may designate that the prize money be given to a particularuniversity that is described in section 170(c)(1), or to any universitythat is described in that section. However, S cannot designate that theaward be given to a donee that is not described in section 170(c)(1), suchas a foreign medical school. Selection of such a donee or inclusion ofsuch a donee on a list of possible donees on S's designation would disqualifythe designation. </ITAG>(2) <T3>Prizes and awards granted before 60 days after date of publicationof final regulations.</T3> In the case of prizes and awards granted before60 days after the date of publication of final regulations, a qualifyingdesignation may be made at any time prior to 105 days after date of publicationof final regulations.  (d) <T3>Transferred by payor.</T3> An exclusion will not be available underthis section unless the designated items or amounts are transferred bythe payor to one or more qualified donee organizations. The provisionsof this paragraph shall not be satisfied unless the items or amounts aretransferred by the payor to one or more qualifying donee organizationsno later than the due date of the return (without regard to extensions)for the taxable year in which the items or amounts would otherwise be includiblein the recipient's gross income. A transfer may be accomplished by anymethod that results in the receipt of the items or amounts by one or morequalified donee organizations from the payor and does not involve a disqualifyinguse of the items or amounts. Delivery of items or amounts by a person associatedwith a payor (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a contractual agent, licensee, or other representative ofthe payor) will satisfy the requirements of this section so long as theitems or amounts are received by, or on behalf of, one or more qualifieddonee organizations. Possession of a prize or award by any person beforea designation is made will not result in the disallowance of an exclusionunless a disqualifying use of the items or amounts is made before the itemsor amounts are returned to the payor for transfer to one or more qualifieddonee organizations (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section for a definitionof ``disqualifying use''). Accordingly, transfer of an item or amount toa nonqualified donee organization will not result in an ineffective transferunder this section if the item or amount is timely returned to the payorby the nonqualified donee organization before a disqualifying use of theitem or amount is made and the item or amount is then transferred to aqualifying organization.  (e) <T3>Definitions</T3>._(1) For purposes of this section, ``qualified doneeorganizations'' means entities defined in section 170(c) (1) or (2) ofthe Code.  (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``disqualifying use'' means,in the case of cash or other intangibles, spending, depositing, investingor otherwise using the prize or award so as to enure to the benefit ofthe recipient or any person other than the grantor or an entity describedin section 170(c) (1) or (2). In the case of tangible items, the term ``disqualifyinguse'' means physical possession of the item for more than a brief periodof time by any person other than the grantor or an entity described insection 170(c) (1) or (2). Thus, physical possession by the recipient ora person associated with the recipient may constitute a disqualifying useif the item is kept for more than a brief period of time. For example,receipt of an unexpected tangible award at a ceremony that otherwise comportswith the requirements of this section will not constitute a disqualifyinguse unless the recipient fails to return the item to the payor as soonas practicable after receipt. (3) For purposes of this section, an item will be considered ``granted''when it is subject to the recipient's dominion and control to such an extentthat it otherwise would be includible in the recipient's gross income.(f) <T3>Charitable deduction not allowable. </T3>Neither the payor nor therecipient will be allowed a charitable deduction for the value of any prizeor award that is excluded under this section.(g) <T3>Qualified scholarships. </T3>See section 117 and the regulations thereunderfor provisions relating to qualified scholarships.<T4>Par. 3. </T4>New andSection; 1.74-2 is added to immediately follow andSection;1.74-1 as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.74-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Special exclusion for certain employee achievement awards.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General rule</T3>_(1) Section 74(c) provides an exclusion from grossincome for the value of an employee achievement award (as defined in section274(j)) received by an employee if the cost to the employer of the awarddoes not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction to the employer forthe cost of the award. Thus, where the cost to the employer of an employeeachievement award is fully deductible after considering the limitationunder section 274(j), the value representing the employer's cost of theaward is excludable from the employee's gross income.(2) Where the cost of an award to the employer is so disproportionate tothe fair market value of the award that there is a significant likelihoodthat the award was given as disguised compensation, no portion of the awardwill qualify as an employee achievement award excludable under the provisionsof this section (see also andSection; 1.274-8(c) (1) and (4)).(b) <T3>Excess deduction award. </T3>Where the cost to the employer of an employeeachievement award exceeds the amount allowable as a deduction to the employer,the recipient must include in gross income an amount which is the greaterof (1) the excess of such cost over the amount that is allowable as a deduction(but not to exceed the fair market value of the award) or (2) the excessof the fair market value of the award over the amount allowable as a deductionto the employer.(c) <T3>Examples. </T3>The operation of this section may be illustrated bythe following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>An employer makes a qualifying length of serviceaward to an employee in the form of a television set. Assume that the deductionlimitation under section 274(j)(2) applicable to the award is $400. Assumealso that the cost of the television set to the employer was $350, andthat the fair market value of the television set is $475. The amount excludableis $475 (the full fair market value of the television set). This is trueeven though the fair market value exceeds both the cost of the televisionset to the employer and the $400 deduction allowable to the employer fornon-qualified plan awards under section 274(j)(2)(A).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1) except thatthe fair market value of the television set is $900. Under these circumstances,the fair market value of the television set is so disproportionate to thecost of the item to the employer that the item will be considered paymentof disguised compensation. As a result, no portion of the award will qualifyas an employee achievement award. Since no portion of the award is excludableby the employee, the employer must report the full fair market value ofthe award as compensation on the employee's Form W-2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>An employer makes a qualifying safety achievementaward to an employee in the form of a pearl necklace. Assume that the deductionlimitation under section 274(j) is $400. Assume also that the cost of thenecklace to the employer is $425 and that the fair market value of thenecklace is $475. The amount includible by the employee in gross incomeis the greater of (a) $25 (the difference between the cost of the item($425) and the employer's deductible amount of $400) or (b) $75 (the amountby which the fair market value of the award ($475) exceeds the employer'sdeductible amount of $400). Accordingly, $75 is the amount includible inthe employee's gross income. The remaining portion of the fair market valueof the award (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the $400 amount allowable as a deduction to the employer)is not included in the gross income of the employee. If the cost of thepearl necklace to the employer was $500 instead of $425, then $100 wouldbe includible in the employee's gross income because the excess of thecost of the award over $400 (<T3>i.e.</T3>, $100) is greater than the excess of the fair market valueof the award over $400 (<T3>i.e.</T3>, $75). The employer must report the $75, which is includiblein the employee's gross income, as compensation on the employee's FormW-2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>An employer invites its employees to attend a partyit is sponsoring to benefit a charity. In order to encourage the employeesto attend the party and to make contributions to the charity, the employerpromises to match the employees' contributions and also provides expensiveprizes to be awarded to contributing employees selected at random. Eachemployee receiving a prize must include the full fair market value of theprize in gross income because the prizes are not qualifying achievementawards under section 274(j) or de minimis fringe benefits under section132(e). Since the prizes are not excludable, the employer must report thefull fair market value of the prize as compensation on the employee's FormW-2.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Special rules</T3>_(1) The exclusion provided by this section shallnot be available for any award made by a sole-proprietorship to the soleproprietor. (2) In the case of an employer exempt from taxation under Subtitle A ofthe Code, any reference in this section to the amount allowable as a deductionto the employer shall be treated as a reference to the amount which wouldbe allowable as a deduction to the employer if the employer were not exemptfrom taxation under Subtitle A of the Code.

Thus, the $1,600 limitation is themaximum amount that may be deducted by an employer for all employee achievementawards granted to any one employee during the taxable year.(c) <T3>Definitions</T3>_(1) <T3>Employee achievement award. </T3>The term ``employee achievement award'',for purposes of this section, means an item of tangible personal propertythat is transferred to an employee by reason of the employee's length ofservice or safety achievement. The item must be awarded as part of a meaningfulpresentation, and under conditions and circumstances that do not createa significant likelihood of the payment of disguised compensation. Forpurposes of section 274(j), an award made by a sole proprietorship to thesole proprietor is not an award made to an employee.(2) <T3>Tangible personal property. </T3>For purposes of this section, theterm ``tangible personal property'' does not include cash or a certificate(other than a nonnegotiable certificate conferring only the right to receivetangible personal property). If a certificate entitles an employee to receivea reduction of the balance due on his account with the issuer of the certificate,the certificate is a negotiable certificate and is not tangible personalproperty for purposes of this section. Other items that will not be consideredto be items of tangible personal property include vacations, meals, lodging,tickets to theater and sporting events, and stocks, bonds, and other securities.(3) <T3>Meaningful presentation. </T3>Whether an award is presented as partof a meaningful presentation is determined by a facts and circumstancestest. While the presentation need not be elaborate, it must be a ceremoniousobservance emphasizing the recipient's achievement in the area of safetyor length of service.(4) <T3>Disguised compensation. </T3>An award will be considered disguisedcompensation if the conditions and circumstances surrounding the awardcreate a significant likelihood that it is payment of compensation. Examplesinclude the making of employee achievement awards at the time of annualsalary adjustments or as a substitute for a prior program of awarding cashbonuses, the providing of employee achievement awards in a manner thatdiscriminates in favor of highly paid employees, or, with respect to awardsthe cost of which would otherwise be fully deductible by the employer underthe deduction limitations of section 274(j)(2), the making of an employeeachievement award the cost of which to the employer is grossly disproportionateto the fair market value of the item.(5) <T3>Qualified plan awards_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of thissection, the term ``qualified plan award'' means an employee achievementaward that is presented pursuant to an established written plan or programthat does not discriminate in terms of eligibility or benefits in favorof highly compensated employees. See section 414(g) of the Code for thedefinition of highly compensated employees. Whether an award plan is establishedshall be determined from all the facts and circumstances of the particularcase, including the frequency and timing of any changes to the plan. Whetheror not an award plan is discriminatory shall be determined from all thefacts and circumstances of the particular case. An award plan may failto qualify because it is discriminatory in its actual operation even thoughthe written provisions of the award plan are nondiscriminatory.(ii) <T3>Items not treated as qualified plan awards. </T3>No award presentedby an employer during the taxable year will be considered a qualified planaward if the average cost of all employee achievement awards presentedduring the taxable year by the taxpayer under any plan described in paragraph(c)(5)(i) of this section exceeds $400. The average cost of employee achievementawards shall be computed by dividing (A) the sum of the costs to the employerfor all employee achievement awards (without regard to the deductibilityof those costs) by (B) the total number of employee achievement awardspresented. For purposes of the preceding sentence, employee achievementawards of nominal value shall not be taken into account in the computationof average cost. An employee achievement award that costs the employer$50 or less shall be considered to be an employee achievement award ofnominal value.(d) <T3>Special rules_</T3>(1) <T3>Partnerships. </T3>Where employee achievement awards are made by apartnership, the deduction limitations of section 274(j)(2) shall applyto the partnership as well as to each member thereof.(2) <T3>Length of service awards._</T3>An item shall not be treated as havingbeen provided for length of service achievement if the item is presentedfor less than 5 years employment with the taxpayer or if the award recipientreceived a length of service achievement award (other than an award excludableunder section 132(e)(1)) during that year or any of the prior 4 calendaryears. An award presented upon the occasion of a recipient's retirementis a length of service award subject to the rules of this section. However,under appropriate circumstances, a traditional retirement award will betreated as a de minimis fringe. For example, assume that an employer providesa gold watch to each employee who completes 25 years of service with theemployer. The value of the gold watch is excluded from gross income asa de minimis fringe. However, if the employer provides a gold watch toan employee who has not completed lengthy service with the employer oron an occasion other than retirment, the value of the watch is not excludablefrom gross income under section 132(e).(3) <T3>Safety achievement awards_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>An item shall not be treated as having been providedfor safety achievement if_(A) During the taxable year, employee achievement awards (other than awardsexcludable under section 132 (e)(1)) for safety achievement have previouslybeen awarded by the taxpayer to more than 10 percent of the eligible employeesof the taxpayer, or (B) Such item is awarded to a manager, administrator, clerical employee,or other professional employee.(ii) <T3>``Eligible employee'' defined. </T3>An eligible employee is one notdescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section and who has workedin a full-time capacity for the taxpayer for a minimum of one year immediatelypreceding the date on which the safety achievement award is presented.(iii) <T3>Special rules. </T3>Where safety achievement awards are presented tomore than 10 percent of the taxpayer's eligible employees, only those awardspresented to eligible employees before 10 percent of the taxpayer's eligibleemployees are exceeded shall be treated as having been provided for safetyachievement. Where the only safety achievement awards presented by an employerconsist of items that are presented at one time during the calendar year,then, if safety achievement awards are presented to more than 10 percentof the taxpayer's eligible employees, the taxpayer may deduct an amountequal to the product of the cost of the item (subject to the applicablededuction limitation) and 10 percent of the taxpayer's eligible employees.Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no award shall be treatedas having been provided for safety achievement except to the extent thatit can be reasonably demonstrated that that award was made before the 10percent limitation was exceeded.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
