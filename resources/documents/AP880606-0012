They judge it so not because of any great strides in human rightsor arms control but because it is a symbol of hope _ a sign thatchange is possible.   Inside Brighton Beach's White Acia delicatessen, where Americancookies are sold alongside hot ponchicks and kbac _ Russian versionsof knishes and apple cider _ Simon Feldman is cautiously optimistic.   ``You cannot be very optimistic because of the communistsystem,'' Feldman says, wiping his hands on an already stained apron.   ``But (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev is really one of thestars we've been looking for. We really want him to succeed,''Feldman said.   Feldman is one of an estimated 35,000 Russian Jews who left theircountry and settled in this once aging and economically depressedocean community.   The immigrants are credited with breathing new life into theneighborhood, which is sandwiched between Coney Island andSheepshead Bay. Their presence is so strong that the community isnow called ``Little Odessa,'' after the Ukrainian city on the BlackSea.   ``The main thing which is our concern is for peace,'' Feldmansaid in halting English. While critics say the summit failed toproduce substantive arms control agreements, Feldman said ``anyaccomplishment means a lot.''   Like Feldman, restaurateurs Misha Fiddler and Mark Rakhman, bothnatives of Odessa, had high praise for Gorbachev.   Rakhman, who owns the Russian nightclub National and a gourmetdelicatessen called Mandamp;I International, says the new spirit ofopenness in the Soviet Union shows ``they're starting to make alittle progress.''   ``It will get better, better and better,'' says Rakhman, leaningagainst a case of Siberian red mustard, caviar and mushroom andvegetable salads.   The changes will not come overnight, says Rakhman, but over time.``They (the Soviets) must grow again from the ground up.''   Fiddler, who owns a fish store and boardwalk restaurant calledMoscow, agrees that Gorbachev is ``doing great things for Russia.''   But as far as the summit is concerned, Fiddler said, it wasPresident Reagan who got what he wanted. ``He's a smart man. Today,Reagan is buying from the Russians peace.''   ``It's going to be peaceful for a long time,'' says Fiddler, anadmitted cynic. ``At least a year.''   Though many of Brighton's Russian immigrants hailed the summit asa step forward in the relationship between the United States and theSoviet Union, Ilya Milman was not one of them.   ``What can I tell you? I don't believe in Russia, that's all. Idon't believe,'' said Milman, putting aside the Hoboe Pycckoe Caobo(New Russian Word) newspaper to offer his views.   Milman, once a professional team handball coach in Kiev and nowmanager of a local nightclub, says all he heard were words.   ``Saying is nothing. They must do something,'' says Milman, acoach for the U.S. Olympic handball team in the 1984 games. ``Wehave no results.''   He conceded the Soviet people have new freedoms but he says theyremain politically tethered.   ``It's good that you can talk a little more freely now,'' saidMilman, dressed in a denim jacket sporting the Olympic logo. ``Butthey're still told stay still, not too much.''   As for Gorbachev, Milman says, ``on the outside, he's a littlebit changed but underneath it's the same. He's just wearing a newface.''   Milman would not call the summit a success and did not expectimmediate results.   ``We must wait. In Russia, any change is for the best,'' he said.``But we must wait.''</TEXT></DOC>
