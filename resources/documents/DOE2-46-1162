The characterizationof the 300 Area process trenches has been conducted as part of an effortinitiated in June 1985, when a facility-specific monitoring program wasimplemented. The characterization effort is part of a regulatory ground-watermonitoring compliance program for hazardous chemicals on the HanfordSite. The characterization work described in this document representsan expanded ground-water monitoring compliance effort, and incorporatesor refers to previous studies useful in characterizing the 300 Area.This document is primarily a compendium of technical information on the300 Area; therefore, data interpretations are limited to the most obviousconclusions. Final conclusions will not be presented until the analysisof data is completed in September 1989. 48 refs., 25 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
