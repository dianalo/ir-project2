Suchincreased Prudhoe Bay production could temporarily replace asmuch as 25% of the oil the U.S. had been importing from Iraqand Kuwait. The additional Alaskan production could come intoplay in the fourth quarter, Mr. Ross indicated.   BP made the calculations in response to an inquiry fromthe Energy Department. Mr. Ross said the question was part ofa survey of major U.S. oil producers to ascertain how muchadditional oil can be produced quickly from flagging U.S.oilfields. Output from Prudhoe Bay began to decline lastyear.   Mr. Ross said that additional wells could quickly bedrilled into existing Alaskan oil reservoirs. But he warnedthat sustaining such a high level of output for long could doserious damage, including reducing the amount of oilrecoverable in the long run.   In addition to sinking new wells, he said, if operatorsare given permission by the state to burn off natural gasthat is normally produced along with oil, output fromexisting wells could increase. Currently, operators arerequired to reinject the gas underground to conserve thatnatural resource. Mr. Ross said environmental restrictions onsuch flaring would have to be waived.   As for world-wide markets, Mr. Ross said he believes thatif only 50% of the four million barrels a day currently lostfrom Iraq and Kuwait could be made up, supply disruptionsprobably could be averted. He maintained that sufficient oilinventory exists world-wide to meet needs through November ifthat much additional production can be found.   But he cautioned: &quot;Any other shock to the supply systemwould clearly throw us into a supply crisis.&quot;   Mr. Ross said believes that Iraq may have more support inthe Arab world than is immediately apparent and thus isbracing for a long stand-off in the Middle East. &quot;Anyonebelieving that this (crisis) will be over within the nextcouple of months will be in for a considerable shock,&quot; Mr.Ross predicted.   He argued that the U.S. and other consuming nations mustbe ready to head off supply shortages as fast as possible,and noted that he and other industry executives are urgingEnergy Department officials to prepare to activitate theStrategic Petroleum Reserve quickly if the need arises.   Mr. Ross said he recently unsuccessfully urged HensonMoore, deputy energy secretary, at least to make thenecessary procedural preparations immediately. &quot;By gettingthe administrative machine ready, we would be prepared toinject oil into the market overnight,&quot;he said, adding: &quot;Evensmall quantities of the oil would have a calming effect onthe market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
