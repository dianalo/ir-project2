Correlation equations are derived for these properties as afunction of chlorine number and molar volume, which enable the solubilityand octanol-water partition coefficients of most congeners to be estimatedwith an accuracy within a factor of 2 and vapor pressure and Henry'slaw constant within a factor of 5. It is suggested that properties ofhomologous series are best correlated by a two-stage process. In thefirst stage, treated here, simple correlations are developed to establishapproximate values as a function of molar volume and chlorine number.This should be followed by a more rigorous second stage treating isomerdifferences and using more refined molecular descriptors. The data presentedhere should be sufficiently accurate for many environmental assessmentpurposes.</TEXT></DOC>
