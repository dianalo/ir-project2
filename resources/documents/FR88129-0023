Interested persons were invitedto submit comments by April 5, 1982. Reply comments in response to commentsfiled in the initial comment period could be submitted by May 5, 1982.In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 30, 1982 (47 FR 13385), the agency advisedthat it had extended the comment period until June 4, 1982, and the replycomment period to July 5, 1982, on the advance notice of proposed rulemakingfor OTC digestive aid drug products to allow for consideration of additionaldata and information.In accordance with andSection; 330.10(a)(1), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration (address above), after deletionof a small amount of trade secret information.In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, one physician,seven drug manufacturers, one research firm, and one trade associationsubmitted comments. Copies of the comments received are on public displayin the Dockets Management Branch.In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations(21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a ``tentative finalmonograph.'' Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule. Inthis tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Subpart D ofPart 357 (21 CFR Part 357, Subpart D), FDA states for the first time itsposition on the establishment of a monograph for OTC digestive aid drugproducts. Final agency action on this matter will occur with the publicationat a future date of a final rule for OTC digestive aid drug products.This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative conclusions on OTC digestiveaid drug products based on the agency's independent evaluation of the Panel'sreport and the comments received. Modifications have been made for clarityand regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new informationhas been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above).These modifications are reflected in the following summary of the commentsand FDA's responses to them.In reviewing the Panel's recommendations on OTC digestive aid drug products,the agency recognizes that there is significant overlap between the rulemakingon OTC digestive aid drug products and other rulemakings in the OTC drugreview. A number of ingredients reviewed as digestive aids were also reviewedfor similar claims in other rulemakings. For example, glutamic acid hydrochloridewas reviewed in the rulemaking for OTC stomach acidifier drug productsand the pancreatic enzymes, pancreatin and pancrelipase, were reviewedin the rulemaking for OTC exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products.(See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 19, 1979 (44 FR 60316); December 21,1979 (44 FR 75666); January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2184); and November 8, 1985(50 FR 46594), respectively.) Simethicone was evaluated for use in relievingthe symptoms of gas in the rulemaking for OTC antiflatulent drug products.(See 21 CFR Part 332.) A number of the ingredients reviewed as digestiveaids are antacid ingredients that are included in the rulemaking for OTCantacid drug products as well as the rulemaking for OTC drug products forrelief of symptoms associated with overindulgence in alcohol and food.(See 21 CFR Part 331 and the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43540), respectively.)In addition, the claims for many of these ingredients in the other rulemakingsare very similar to those in the digestive aid rulemaking, i.e., to relievesymptoms of gastrointestinal distress (e.g., heartburn, sour stomach, acidindigestion, gas, upset stomach, etc.). Therefore, in proceeding with the development of this tentative final monographon OTC digestive aid drug products, the agency has decided to limit thedigestive aid rulemaking to those ingredients and labeling claims thathave not been adequately covered by other rulemakings on OTC drug products.For further discussion, see comment 4 below.The OTC procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that any testingnecessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resultedin a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the resultsof that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemakingprocess before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDAwill no longer use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safeand effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (not generally recognizedas safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available dataare insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testingis required) at the final monograph stage, but will use instead the terms``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonograph conditions''(old Categories II and III). This document retains the concepts of Categories,I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage.The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products thatare subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe andeffective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after that date, no OTC drug product thatis subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognizedas safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unlessit is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug productsubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC digestive aid drugproducts (published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 5, 1982 (47 FR 454)), the agency suggestedthat the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Experience has shown that relabeling of productscovered by the monograph is necessary in order for manufacturers to complywith the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have tobe written, ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturingprocess. The agency has determined that it is impractical to expect newlabeling to be in effect 6 months after the date of publication of thefinal monograph. Experience has shown also that if the deadline for relabelingis too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and relatedpaperwork.In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to comply withthe monograph. Reformulation often involves the need to do stability testingon the new product. An accelerated aging process may be used to test anew formulation; however, if the stability testing is not successful, andif further reformulation is required, there could be a further delay inhaving a new product available for manufacture.The agency wishes to establish a reasonable period of time for relabelingand reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the marketplacethat could not only result in economic loss, but also interfere with consumers'access to safe and effective drug products. Therefore, the agency is proposingthat the final monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The agency believes that within 12 months afterthe date of publication most manufacturers can order new labeling and reformulatetheir products and have them in compliance in the marketplace.If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included inthe final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effectivedate, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety problemis identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadlinemay be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products.In the event that no new data are submitted to the agency during the allotted12-month new data period or if submitted data are not sufficient to establish``monograph conditions'' for OTC digestive aid drug products, the finalrule will declare there products to be new drugs under section 201(p) ofthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (p)),for which applications approved under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C.355) and 21 CFR 314 are required for marketing. Such rule will also declarethat in the absence of an approval application, these products would bemisbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). The rule willthen be incorporated into 21 CFR Part 310, Subpart E_Requirements for SpecificNew Drugs or Devices, instead of into an OTC drug monograph in Part 357.All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notices publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31696) and August27, 1975 (40 FR 38179) or to additional information that has come to theagency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposedrulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>General Comments1. One comment contented that OTC drug monographs are interpretive, asopposed to substantive, regulations. The comment referred to statementson this issue submitted earlier to other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings.The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preambleto the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464), and in paragraph3 of the preamble to the tentative final monograph for OTC antacid drugproducts, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260). FDA reaffirmsthe conclusions stated there. Subsequent court decisions have confirmedthe agency's authority to issue substantive regulations by rulemaking.See, e.g., <T3>National Nutritional Foods Association </T3>v.<T3> Weinberger,</T3> 512 F.2d 688, 696-98 (2d Cir. 1975) and <T3>National Association of Pharmaceutical Manfacturers </T3>v.<T3> FDA,</T3> 487 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), <T3>aff'd</T3> 637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).2. One comment contended that FDA lacks the statutory authority to prescribeexclusive lists of terms from which indications for OTC drug use must bedrawn, thus prohibiting alternative OTC labeling terminology that is truthful,accurate, not misleading, and intelligible to the consumer. The commentstated that existing statutory provisions (15 U.S.C. 1453(a)), and sections508 and 502(e) of the fact (21 U.S.C. 358 and 352(e)) do not grant FDAthe authority to legislate the exact wording of OTC drug claims to theexclusion of other equally accurate and truthful claims. The comment furthercontended that section 502(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)) may in factbe violated by manufacturers if some of the terms being prescribed by OTCreview panels are adopted because the act requires that label informationbe in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by consumersunder ordinary conditions of purchase and use.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency publisheda final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indicating foruse of OTC drug products. Under the final rule, the label and labelingof OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuouslocation, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use establishedunder an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing such indications for usethat meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling,which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVEDUSES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which mayappear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternativelanguage describing indications for use that is not false or misleading,which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All required OTC drug labelingother than indications for use (e.g., statement of identity, warnings,and directions) must appear in the specific wording established under anOTC drug monograph where exact language has been established and identifiedby quotation marks in an applicable monograph or other regulation, e.g.,21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). The proposed rule in this document is subjectto the final rule revising the labeling policy.3. One comment disagreed with the Panel's recommendation that inactiveingredients be listed on the label. The comment argued that a list of inactiveingredients would be meaningless to all but a few consumers and that sucha list might overemphasize the importance of the inactive ingredients,obscure more meaningful information such as warnings or directions foruse, and be more confusing than helpful. The comment also stated that ifthe quantity of the inactive ingredients had to be listed there would bean additional problem of changing the labels whenever the quantity of aninactive ingredient is changed.The act specifies the requirements for ingredient labeling of OTC drugproducts. Section 502(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)) requires that allactive ingredients and certain other ingredients, whether included as activeor inactive, be disclosed on the label. The act also limits the requirementfor stating quantity of ingredients in OTC drug products to those specificallymentioned in section 502(e). Although the act does not require the disclosureof all inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products, the agencyagrees with the Panel that listing of inactive ingredients in OTC drugproduct labeling would be useful information for some consumers. Consumerswith known allergies or intolerance to certain ingredients would then beable to identify substances that they may wish to avoid.The Proprietary Association, the trade association that represents approximately85 OTC drug manufacturers who reportedly market between 90 and 95 percentof the volume of all OTC drug products sold in the United States, has announcedthat its member companies would voluntarily begin to list inactive ingredientsin the labeling of OTC drug products under guidelines established by theassociation (Ref. 1). Under another voluntary program begun in 1974, themember companies of The Proprietary Association have been including thequantities of active ingredients on OTC drug labels. The agency is notat this time proposing to require the listing of inactive ingredients inOTC drug product labeling. However, the agency commends these voluntaryefforts and urges all other OTC drug manufacturers to similarly label theirproducts.<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``Proprietary Association Adopts Disclosure of Inactive Ingredients,''News Release, The Proprietary Association, Washington, DC, May 14, 1984,copy included in OTC Volume 17GTFM.</ITAG>4. Several comments disagreed with the Panel's recommendations to dividedigestive aid drug products into two categories, that is, (1) productsfor immediate postprandial upper abdominal distress (IPPUAD) and (2) productsfor intestinal distress_with the distinguishing feature between the twocategories being the time to onset of symptoms. The comments pointed outthat the symptoms of bloating, distention, fullness, and pressure are thesame for both categories. The comments stated that patients do not differentiatesymptoms on the basis of time relationships and, therefore, establishinga time-based differentiation of symptoms has no logical basis. One commentargued that adopting the Panel's recommendations would create a ``phantom''category of products that the consuming public could not understand. Mostcomments recommended that the concept of IPPUAD be abolished, and severalsuggested that the digestive aid monograph be expanded to encompass allabdominal and intestinal distress claims, whether due to food-related orother causes, e.g., stress, travel, or changes in the environment.The Panel reviewed digestive aid drug products as those products whichwere claimed to alleviate symptoms in the stomach as well as the intestinesfollowing the ingestion of food. In reviewing these products, the Paneldecided to classify them into the following two groups: (1) Those thattreat symptoms that occur within 30 minutes after ingestion of food (immediatepostprandial upper abdominal distress drug products) and (2) those thattreat symptoms that occur from 30 minutes to several hours after ingestionof food (intestinal distress drug products). As one comment pointed out,the symptom complex of bloating, distention, fullness, and pressure wascommon to both classifications.After reviewing the available data and information, the agency agrees withthe comments that the distinction between IPPUAD and intestinal distress,with the distinguishing feature being the time to onset of symptoms, isone that will have little meaning to consumers. In addition, historically,this distinction has not been made in the labeling of digestive aid drugproducts. Further, the agency notes that the Miscellaneous Internal Panelalso reviewed drug products for relieving symptoms of overindulgence infood and drink and did not make such a time distinction in that rulemaking.Therefore, the agency is not adopting the two classifications of IPPUADand intestinal distress and is defining a digestive aid drug product as``a drug product intended to relieve the symptoms of gastrointestinal distress(including fullness, pressure, bloating, and stuffed feeling (commonlyreferred to as gas), and minor pain and cramping) following the ingestionof food.'' The agency does not believe it is appropriate to expand the scope of thisrulemaking to include gastrointestinal distress other than that relatedto food. As discussed in the preamble above, there is significant overlapwith respect to ingredients and claims within the digestive aid rulemakingand other OTC drug rulemakings, i.e., antacid, antiflatulent, exocrinepancreatic insufficiency, overindulgence in food and drink, and stomachacidifier. For example, the final monograph for OTC antacid drug productsincludes the indication for the relief of heartburn, sour stomach, acidindigestion, and upset stomach associated with these symptoms. The labelingdoes not specify the etiology of the symptoms and, therefore, would notpreclude the use of antacids for relieving upset stomach associated withheartburn, sour stomach, or acid indigestion that may occur following theingestion of food or from other causes, e.g., stress, etc. Further, theterm ``acid indigestion'' suggests a food-related cause.In order to avoid duplication, the agency is limiting the digestive aidrulemaking to include only those ingredients that have not been adequatelycovered by other OTC drug rulemakings that address similar claims relatedto relief of symptoms of gastrointestinal distress. As discussed above,antacid ingredients and simethicone have been adequately considered forgastrointestinal distress claims in the rulemakings for OTC antacid drugproducts and OTC antiflatulent drug products, respectively. In addition,as discussed in comments 8 and 10 below, pancreatic enzyme ingredientsand stomach acidifier ingredients have been reviewed for use in aidingdigestion in the rulemakings for OTC exocrine pancreatic insufficiencydrug products and OTC stomach acidifier drug products, respectively. Afterreviewing the ingredients evaluated by the Panel, the agency has determinedthat the following ingredients are appropriate for consideration in thedigestive aid rulemaking: Bismuth sodium tartrate, cellulase, charcoal,dehydrocholic acid, duodenal substance, garlic, hemicellulase, homatropinemethylbromide, ox bile extract, papain, peppermint oil, pepsin, and sorbitol.Because no new data for any of these ingredients were submitted followingpublication of the Panel's recommendations, the agency is concurring withthe Panel's categorization of these ingredients as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s25,xs34</C> <H1>Ingredient</H1><H1>Categorization</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Bismuth sodium tartrate<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cellulase<D>III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Charcoal, activated and Charcoal, wood<D>III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dehydrocholic acid<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Duodenal substance<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Garlic, dehydrated<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hemicellulase<D>III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Homatropine methylbromide<D>III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ox bile extract<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Papain<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Peppermint oil<D>III</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pepsin<D>II</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sorbitol<D>II</D></ITAG></ITAG>In addition, the agency is aware of another enzyme (lactase) that is containedin a number of marketed products and is promoted for use as a digestiveaid for persons who are intolerant to lactose-containing foods. Lactasedeficiency is extremely prevalent, estimated to occur in about 75 percentof adults (Ref. 1). Although the condition can be controlled by ingestinga lactose-free diet, the agency believes that lactase enzyme products couldbe potentially useful for those persons who do not wish to avoid lactosein their diets. However, no submissions were made to the agency regardingthese products, nor is the agency aware of any specific data that wouldestablish general recognition of safety and effectiveness. Therefore, theagency invites specific data and information regarding the use of lactaseenzyme products. After review and evaluation of the data submitted, theagency will consider lactase for inclusion in the final monograph for OTCdigestive aid drug products.Based on the above discussion, the agency is proposing the following indicationfor OTC digestive aid drug products: ``For relief of symptoms of gastrointestinaldistress such as'' (select one or more of the following: ``fullness,''``pressure,'' ``bloating,'' or ``stuffed feeling'') (optional: ``(commonlyreferred to as gas),'') (optional: ``pain,'' and/or ``cramping'') ``whichoccur(s) after eating.'' Although the Panel included the word ``distention''in its indication statements for IPPUAD and intestinal distress drug products,the agency is not proposing this word in the indication statement in thistentative final monograph. Based on the discussion in comment 7 below,the agency has determined that ``distention'' is not a word that is usedby consumers in describing symptoms of gastrointestinal distress.<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy,'' 14th Edition, editedby R. Berkow; Merck and Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, p. 779, 1982.</ITAG>5. Several comments objected to the Panel's review of simethicone as adigestive aid ingredient and requested that the final monograph for OTCantiflatulent drug products be neither revoked nor modified based on thePanel's conclusions that there is no conclusive evidence that excess gasis the causative agent in producing undersirable gastrointestinal symptomssuch as bloating, pressure, or fullness. The comments added that thereis no new and significant data that question the safety or effectivenessof simethicone, which was included in the final monograph for OTC antiflatulentdrug products (21 CFR Part 332). Several comments stated that the Panelmisinterpreted its charge from the agency which was to review the safetyand effectiveness data submitted on antiflatulent ingredients other thansimethicone in order to determine whether such ingredients should be addedto the antiflatulent monograph. Referring to the call-for-data notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 27, 1975 (40 FR 38183), the commentsstated that a re-review of simethicone for use in relieving the symptomsof gas is contrary to established OTC drug review procedures and to thespecific charge to the Panel that it should not review ingredients forconditions that had been previously reviewed by other panels. The commentsargued that there is no legal basis to restrict labeling to claims or situationswhere definitive proof of causation has been established and that OTC drugproducts are used to provide relief of the symptoms, not the cause. Thecomments stated that it is irrelevant whether excess gas actually causesthe symptoms described by consumers as ``gas,'' provided an ingredientcan be shown to be safe and effective in relieving those symptoms.The agency agrees with the comments that the final monograph for OTC antiflatulentdrug products should not be revoked or modified based on the Panel's recommendations.Although the agency agrees with the Panel that data are insufficient todemonstrate that excess gas actually causes the symptoms of bloating, pressure,and fullness, data are available to demonstrate that ``gas'' is a wordused by consumers to describe these symptoms. In developing the antiflatulentfinal monograph, the agency relied on the results of two double-blind studies(Refs. 1 and 2) which demonstrated the effectiveness of simethicone inrelieving symptoms of upper gastrointestinal distress. (See 38 FR 31266.)In both studies, the symptoms described as bloating, fullness, pressure,and stuffed feeling were among those evaluated. Although the studies didnot demonstrate that the symptoms were actually caused by excess gas, simethiconewas demonstrated to be effective in relieving the symptoms. In addition,the results of a consumer survey indicate that the terms ``bloating,''``pressure,'' ``stuffed feeling,'' and ``fullness'' are very meaningfulto and used by consumers in describing what is commonly, if not accurately,referred to as ``gas.'' (See comment 7 below.) Therefore, the agency agreeswith the comments that evidence need not be available demonstrating thecause of a symptom as long as there is sufficient evidence to show thatan ingredient provides relief from the symptom.However, as discussed in the preamble above, the agency is limiting thedigestive aid rulemaking to those ingredients and labeling claims whichhave not been adequately covered by other rulemakings on OTC drug products.Therefore, simethicone is no longer being considered in this digestiveaid rulemaking. (See also comment 7 below.)<ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Kasich, A., ``A Summary of a Double-Blind Study Comparing theEffectiveness of Simethicone and Placebo in the Relief of Symptoms of FunctionalDisease of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract,'' copy of unpublished studyincluded in OTC Volume 17GTFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) ``A Summary of the Double-Blind Study of the Effectiveness ofSimethicone in Relieving the Symptoms of Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Distress,''copy of unpublished study included in OTC Volume 17GTFM.</ITAG>6. Referring to the Panel's recommended indication in andSection; 357.350(b)(1)which states, `` `For relief of upper abdominal' (one or more of the followingsymptoms: `distress,' `bloating,' `distention,' `fullness,' and `pressure')`which occurs soon after eating,' (optional, `and which may be describedas `gas.')'', one comment suggested that the words ``and which may be describedas'' be deleted as unnecessary and that the word ``gas'' be placed amongthe other allowable words such as ``bloating, distress, distention, fullness,and pressure.'' The agency agrees with the Panel that data are insufficient to demonstratethat excess gas actually causes the symptoms of gastrointestinal distressthat may occur after eating. However, data are available demonstratingthat ``gas'' is a word that is commonly, although not accurately, usedby consumers to describe those symptoms. (See comment 7 below.) Becausethe word ``gas'' is used by consumers to describe those symptoms, the agencyhas no objection to its use in the labeling of OTC digestive aid drug productsprovided there is no implication that the presence of gas, in the literalsense of excess gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, is the causeof the symptoms. Likewise, there should be no implication that ``gas''is a symptom distinct or different from the terms used by consumers todescribe the symptoms of what they perceive as ``gas,'' i.e., ``bloating,''``pressure,'' ``fullness,'' ``stuffed feeling.'' Therefore, the agencydoes not agree that ``gas'' should be placed among the other allowablewords because it would imply a symptom different from the others when,in fact, it is a term used to collectively describe those symptoms. As discussed in comment 4 above, the agency is proposing the followingindication for OTC digestive aid drug products: ``For relief of symptomsof gastrointestinal distress such as'' (select one or more of the following:``fullness,'' ``pressure,'' ``bloating,'' or ``stuffed feeling'') (optional:``(commonly referred to as gas),'') (optional: ``pain,'' and/or ``cramping'')``which occur(s) after eating.'' 7. Referring to a previously submitted petition (Ref. 1), one comment requestedthe agency to expand the labeling indications of antiflatulent drug productsto include the terms ``bloating,'' ``gas pressure,'' ``stuffed feeling,''and ``fullness,'' as descriptive words for the symptoms of gas. Notingthe results of a consumer survey (Ref. 1), the comment contended that theseterms are used by consumers to describe the symptoms of gas and there isno basis to preclude the use of these terms in the labeling of OTC antiflatulentdrug products. The comment also requested that the term ``antigas'' beincluded in the monograph because it is more meaningful to consumers thanthe term ``antiflatulent.'' The agency has reviewed and evaluated the available data and determinedthat the terms requested by the comment are appropriate for inclusion inthe monograph for OTC antiflatulent drug products. In developing the antiflatulentmonograph, the agency relied on the results of two double-blind studies(Refs. 2 and 3) which demonstrated the effectiveness of simethicone inrelieving symptoms of upper gastrointestinal distress. (See 38 FR 31266.)In both studies the symptoms described as ``bloating,'' ``fullness,'' ``pressure,''and ``stuffed feeling'' were among those evaluated. In both studies, simethiconewas demonstrated to be effective for relieving these symptoms. In addition, the results of the consumer survey (Ref. 1) indicate thatthe terms ``bloating,'' ``pressure,'' ``stuffed feeling,'' and ``fullness,''are very meaningful to and used by consumers in describing what is commonly,if not accurately, referred to as `'gas.'' Based on these data, the agencyis proposing elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to amend the antiflatulent monograph to includethe following indication: (Select one of the following: ``Alleviates''or ``Relieves'') (select one or more of the following: ``bloating,'' ``pressure,''``fullness,'' or ``stuffed feeling'') ``commonly referred to as gas.''The agency is also proposing to amend that monograph to include a ``statementof identity'' section to conform with the format of other final OTC drugmonographs. The agency agrees that the term ``antigas'' is an appropriatestatement of identity as an alternative or in addition to the term ``antiflatulent''provided there are not statements elsewhere in the labeling implying thatthe symptoms are caused by the presence of excess gas. For example, phrasessuch as ``antigas formulation relieves gas trapped in the intestine'' or``for gas pain'' would be considered inappropriate. <ITAG tagnum="74">Reference </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Petition from Plough, Inc., dated May 18, 1976, on file underDocket No. 76P-0218, Dockets Management Branch. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Kasich, A., ``A Summary of a Double-Blind Study Comparing theEffectiveness of Simethicone and Placebo in the Relief of Symptoms of FunctionalDisease of Upper Gastrointestinal Tract,'' copy of unpublished study includedin OTC Volume 17GTFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) ``A Summary of the Double-Blind Study of the Effectiveness ofSimethicone in Relieving the Symptoms of Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Distress,''copy of unpublished study included in OTC Volume 17GTFM. </ITAG>8. One comment believed that there were inconsistencies in the Panel'sconclusions regarding the classification of pancreatin and pancrelipaseand their components. The comment questioned why pancreatin and pancrelipasewere classified by the Panel as Category III for the symptoms of intestinaldistress when their major constituents, amylase, lipase, and protease,were classifed as single ingredients in Category II. Furthermore, the commentcontended that the Panel's Category III classification for the combinationof lipase, amylase, protease, and hemicellulase contradicts its own statement(47 FR 462) that any combination of ingredients containing one or moreCategory II ingredients is Category II. The agency acknowledges that it seems the Panel was inconsistent with itsown combination policy in classifying pancreatin and pancrelipase as CategoryIII when the major components of these substances, as single ingredients,are classified Category II. However, pancreatin and pancrelipase are extractsof natural origin that contain amylase, lipase, and protease, and, as such,are considered by ``The United States Pharmacopeia/The National Formulary''as single substances when these components are combined as specified inthe compendia (Ref. 1). Therefore, the Panel considered pancreatin andpancrelipase as single ingredients. The agency concurs with the Panel's conclusion that there are no data tosupport the use of amylase, lipase, or protease other than as the combinationof the three principal components. Therefore, amylase, lipase, and proteaseas single ingredients are Category II. The ingredients pancreatin and pancrelipasewere considered by the agency in the tentative final monograph for OTCexocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46594). In that document,the agency concurred with the Panel's recommendation that pancreatin andpancrelipase are beneficial only in cases of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency.The agency is not aware of any well-controlled studies demonstrating theeffectiveness of these ingredients in aiding or facilitating the digestiveprocess, except in cases of diagnosed pancreatic enzyme insufficiency.Therefore, those ingredients are not being reconsidered in this rulemaking.Hemicellulase will remain in Category III as a digestive aid single ingredient.<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``The United States Pharmacopeia XXI-National Formulary XVI,''United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, pp 777 and779, 1985. </ITAG>9. Several comments opposed the testing guidelines recommended by the Panelfor Category III OTC digestive aid drug products. Three comments objectedto the Panel's recommendation that the test population consist only ofindividuals who have consulted a gastroenterologist for treatment of theirsymptoms because these individuals are not representative of the generalpopulation who experience the symptoms of IPPUAD or intestinal distress.One comment suggested that a more representative test population wouldbe composed of individuals who, following food consumption, successfullyself-medicate with OTC drug products to relieve the occasional symptomsof gas, fullness, bloating, distention, and/or pressure. Two comments emphasizedthat the Panel's requirement that complete relief be demonstrated within30 minutes of administration of medication is overburdensome with regardto establishing efficacy. The comment stressed that significant reliefof symptoms within an appropriate amount of time, even if relief is onlypartial, is an important criterion. Two comments criticized the Panel'scriteria for admission into the study. These comments contended that therequirements for comprehensive medical histories with expensive diagnostictesting are unrealistic and unnecessary. The agency has not addressed specific testing guidelines in this document.In revising the OTC drug review procedures relating to Category III, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730), the agencyadvised that tentative final and final monographs will not include recommendedtesting guidelines for conditions that industry wishes to upgrade to monographstatus. Instead, the agency will meet with industry representatives attheir request to discuss testing protocols. The revised procedures alsostate the time in which test data must be submitted for consideration indeveloping the final monograph. (See also part II. paragraph A.2. below_<T3>Testing of Category II and Category III conditions.</T3>) 10. One comment noted that although the Panel's report on OTC digestiveaids does not deal directly with its product (which is labeled for useas a stomach acidifier), the report does review the active ingredient (glutamicacid hydrochloride) contained in its product for general use in the treatmentof IPPUAD and intestinal distress. The comment requested that submissionsmade to the rulemaking for OTC stomach acidifier drug products (Refs. 1,2, and 3) be incorporated by reference in this rulemaking because the symptomsthat characterize IPPUAD and intestinal distress are among the recognizedsymptoms of gastric acid deficiency. The comment contended that when thesymptoms of IPPUAD and intestinal distress are due to deficiencies of hydrochloricacid its product has been shown to provide effective therapy. The commentrecommends that the agency classify glutamic acid hydrochloride as a CategoryI digestive aid. Furthermore, the comment contended that this product isexempt from review under the ``grandfather'' provisions of the 1938 actand the 1962 amendments to the act.As discussed in comment 4 above, the agency is limiting the digestive aidrulemaking to include only those ingredients that have not been adequatelycovered by other OTC drug rulemakings for similar claims. Glutamic acidhydrochloride was reviewed in the rulemaking for OTC stomach acidifierdrug products (Docket No. 79N-0176). The use evaluated was as an aid todigestion by increasing the amount of hydrochloric acid in the stomachin cases of achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria. In the tentative final monographfor OTC stomach acidifier drug products, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2184), the agencyclassified stomach acidifier active ingredients, including glutamic acidhydrochloride, in Category II because the conditions of hypochlorhydriaand achlorhydria are not established medical conditions causing any specificsymptoms that require treatment. Further, the Panel stated that it knowsof no proven relationship between hypoacidity or anacidity of the stomachand the symptoms of IPPUAD (47 FR 465) and the symptoms of intestinal distress(47 FR 497). The Panel also stated that it was not aware of any adequateand well-controlled clinical studies demonstrating the effectiveness ofglutamic acid hydrochloride in treating the symptoms of IPPUAD (47 FR 465)or intestinal distress (47 FR 479). The Panel concluded that glutamic acidhydrochloride is not generally recognized as an effective treatment forthese conditions. Based on the Panel's findings and the conclusions presentedin the tentative final monograph for OTC stomach acidifier drug products,the agency does not believe it would be appropriate to further considerglutamic acid hydrochloride in this digestive aid rulemaking.The agency also addressed the ``grandfather'' status of the glutamic acidhydrochloride product in the tentative final monograph for OTC stomachacidifier drug products (50 FR 2186). Based on that discussion, the agencyreaffirms that the glutamic acid hydrochloride product is subject to theOTC drug review.The discussion in this tentative final monograph is the agency's finalconsideration of glutamic acid hydrochloride in the rulemaking for OTCdigestive aid drug products. The agency's final conclusions with respectto the indications for glutamic acid hydrochloride referred to in the commentwill appear in the final rule for OTC stomach acidifier drug products.The final regulations for OTC stomach acidifier drug products, not thefinal regulations for OTC digestive aid drug products, will be those applicableto this glutamic acid hydrochloride product.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(1) OTC Volume 170103.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(2) OTC Volume 170104.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(3) OTC Volume 170124.</ITAG>11. One comment recommended that the agency not adopt the Panel's recommendedwarning for aluminum-containing antacid products, which reads, ``If youhave kidney disease, do not take this product except under the supervisionof a physician.'' (See 47 FR 468.) The comment argued that a fair balanceof the literature indicates that the association of ingested aluminum-containingdrug products in patients with impaired kidney function and encephalopathyhas not been demonstrated; therefore, the recommended warning should notbe adopted.The agency reviewed all available data concerning aluminum toxicity andpublished its conclusions on these data in the notice of proposed rulemakingfor OTC hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia drug products in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2160). The agencyconcluded that the largest body of evidence of toxicity associated withaluminum is stongest for encephalopathy that occurs in renal failure patientsundergoing dialysis. (See 50 FR 2162.) Although aluminum has not been provento be a causative factor, there is considerable indirect evidence thatit has a role in development of this syndrome. Because of this potentialrole, the agency believes it is appropriate to provide warning labelingto this effect. However, the agency believes that the persons at highestrisk to aluminum toxicity are those with severe renal failure who are generallyunder the care of a physician. The agency thus concluded that it wouldbe more prudent to inform health professionals of the potential risks involvedrather than to require the kidney-disease warning recommended by the Panel.The agency reaffirms its previous conclusion (50 FR 2162) that additionalinformation be provided in the professional labeling section of the antacidmonograph (21 CFR 331.31) for aluminum-containing antacids.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

That policy statement includes proceduresfor the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings withindustry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submittedtest data and other information. B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's Recommendations FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concludesthat it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report and recommended monographwith the changes described in FDA's responses to the comments above andwith other changes described in the summary below. A summary of the changesmade by the agency follows: 1. The agency is not adopting the two classifications (IPPUAD and intestinaldistress) for digestive aid drug products recommended by the Panel andis proposing a new definition for OTC digestive aid drug products. (Seecomment 4 above.) Based on this change, the definitions section of thetentative final monograph has been modified accordingly. 2. The agency is limiting the digestive aid rulemaking to include onlythose ingredients that have not been adequately covered by other OTC drugrulemakings that address similar claims related to relief of symptoms ofgastrointestinal distress. (See comment 4 above and Part II. paragraphA.I. above_Summary of ingredient categories.) 3. The agency is proposing a new indication statement for OTC digestiveaid drug products. (See comments 4 and 6 above.) 4. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in anumber of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor''for ``physician'' in OTC drug monographs on the basic that the word ``doctor''is more commonly used and better understood by consumers. Based on commentsreceived to these proposals, the agency has determined that final monographsand any applicable OTC drug regulation will give manufacturers the optionof using either the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This tentativefinal monograph proposes that option. The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC digestiveaid drug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC digestive aid drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposedrule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC digestive aiddrug products. No comments on economic impacts were received. Any commentson the agency's initial determination of the economic consequences of thisproposed rulemaking should be submitted by May 31, 1988. The agency willevaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassessthe economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined that under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this actionis of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significantimpact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.            Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1988, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. Arequest for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and timerequested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determinationmay be submitted on or before May 31, 1988. Three copies of all comments,objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this documentand may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections,and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4>Interested persons, on or before January 30, 1989, may also submit in writingnew data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditionsnot classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submittedon or before March 29, 1989. These dates are consistent with the time periodsspecified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulationsfor reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copiesof all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified withthe docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Dataand comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305)(address above). Received data and comments may also be seen in the officeabove between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consideronly data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record onMarch 29, 1989. Data submitted after the closing of the administrativerecord will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>unless the Commissioner finds good cause hasbeen shown that warrants earlier consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 357</ITAG>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Digestive aid drug products.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the AdministrativeProcedure Act, it is proposed that Subchapter D of Chapter I of Title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended in Part 357 by adding newSubpart D, consisting of andSection;andSection; 357.301-357.350, to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 357_MISCELLANEOUS INTERNAL DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTERHUMAN USE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Digestive Aid Drug Products</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">357.301 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">357.303 Definition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">357.310 Digestive aid active ingredients.
