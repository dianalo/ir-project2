The chamber voted 97-0 to approve the obscenity measure, tackingit onto a controversial family leave bill with an uncertain future.Final action on the two-part bill was expected late today.   The unanimous vote on the obscenity amendment followed hours ofsenatorial hand-wringing over child porn profiteers, a fewconstitutional reservations and several references, veiled andunveiled, to the demands of a political season.   ``Those who vote against this ought to do so at their ownperil,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It's time for the U.S.Senate to set the standard in this area, for us to stand up and dowhat we should do, and I know that everybody in this bodyrecognizes this filth problem.''   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., makesit easier to prosecute crimes and secure civil penalties in casesinvolving child pornography and obscene materials. The measure alsosets stiff fines and prison terms, including 20 years to life forbuying or selling children for use in child pornography.   It was added to a bill requiring large companies to offer atleast 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to employees withmedical crises or new babies. Thurmond has been among theconservatives leading the charge against the leave bill.   But Thurmond and Hatch complained that although the childpornography bill had 45 co-sponsors, other members blocked it fromcoming up in the Judiciary Committee for seven months. They saidthis was the only way to bring it to the floor.   The Thurmond amendment would:   _Ban buying and selling of children for use in child pornography.   _Ban the use of computers to distribute or advertise childpornography.   _Require producers of sexually explicit material to document theages of persons appearing in the material.   _Give states clear authority to regulate obscene or indecentprogramming on cable and subscription television services. Thiswould overturn a Supreme Court decision.   _Raise the maximum penalties for transmitting obscenedial-a-porn messages from six months in jail and a $50,000 fine totwo years and $250,000.   _Make it illegal to sell or possess obscene material or childpornography on federal lands. Individuals could be fined up to$5,000 and sentenced to six months in jail for possession; up to$250,000 and two years in jail for sale.   _Make it easier for prosecutors to file civil forfeiture suitsagainst people possessing obscene materials and set fines of up to$250,000 for people who possess obscene material in violation ofobscenity statutes.   Not voting on the measure were Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, andDan Quayle, R-Ind., the two vice presidential nominees, and SparkMatsunaga, D-Hawaii.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., cited several areas of constitutionalconcern including what he called the ``very troubling'' federallands provision.   He said it would encompass the entire Virgin Islands and Indianterritory, national parks, military bases and federal buildings.The Senate is trying to protect children, ``not trying to reach asoldier who has an obscene book in his car,'' Specter said.   But Thurmond insisted his bill is constitutional and saidCongress shouldn't waste time quibbling. ``We are trying to banobscenity,'' he said. ``If you want to protect the children of thiscountry, you've got to take a stand.''</TEXT></DOC>
