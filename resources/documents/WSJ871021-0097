The study's author, Erich Daub of the school's Center for Injury Prevention, said the emergency air-evacuation system already is &quot;demonstrably dangerous&quot; and called on the federal government to promptly tighten safety rules.    The Federal Aviation Administration has been studying the industry. Currently, medical helicopters operate under the general rules for helicopters. There are 199 air-emergency programs in the country, many of them run by private companies.    Mr. Daub presented his findings yesterday to the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association in New Orleans. He said that the crash and injury rate for medical helicopters for the past six years is 100 times that of private planes and five times that of helicopters in general.    Mr. Daub suggested that perhaps emergency helicopters be used only in rural areas, and he said the government should set minimum safety and crew performance standards for them.    An official for Helicopters Association International, a trade group that opposes more government controls, said Mr. Daub's figures overstate the accident rate for emergency helicopters. </TEXT></DOC>
