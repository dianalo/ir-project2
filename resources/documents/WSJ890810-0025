The 12, some of whom were charged with racketeering and face stiff prison terms and seizure of assets if found guilty, are among 46 traders indicted last week for allegedly defrauding customers. On Tuesday, three yen-futures traders, Brian and James Sledz and Thomas Braniff, pleaded guilty to one or two counts of mail- and wire-fraud charges and to commodities fraud, and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.    Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly indicated to U.S. District Court Judge George Marovich yesterday that he expected a handful of other yen-futures traders to plead guilty as well. Twenty-one yen-futures traders were indicted last week.    Traders from the Swiss franc pit at the Merc, as well as from the Chicago Board of Trade's soybean-futures and Treasury bond-futures pits, are expected to enter their pleas during the next two weeks.    Among those pleading innocent yesterday were John M. Baker, Sam A. Cali and Thomas A. Crouch, who were indicted on fraud charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, known as RICO, as well as RICO conspiracy charges. If convicted on these counts they face prison terms of up to 20 years, fines of as much as $250,000 and seizure of exchange memberships and trading profits and commissions.    In addition to the RICO counts, Mr. Baker, 50 years old -- looking pale in a somber business suit, a marked contrast to the brightly colored paisley jackets he often wore on the Merc trading floor -- is charged with 20 counts of mail and wire fraud and 25 counts of commodities-trading fraud. Mr. Cali, 38, is also charged with 41 counts of mail and wire fraud and 58 counts of commodities-trading fraud. And Mr. Crouch, 43, faces 19 counts of mail and wire fraud and 20 counts of commodities-trading fraud.    Ray Pace, 33, who also pleaded innocent to RICO conspiracy charges, faces 44 counts of mail and wire fraud and 82 counts of commodities-trading fraud as well. And Michael D. Smith, 34, pleaded innocent to RICO conspiracy charges, 12 counts of mail and wire fraud and 19 counts of commodities-trading fraud.    Mail, wire and commodities fraud are punishable by prison terms of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000.    Other yen-futures traders pleading innocent include Robert H. Bailin, 36, charged with 10 counts of mail and wire fraud and 22 counts of commodities-trading fraud; Michael I. Greenfield, 28, eight counts of mail and wire fraud and 10 counts of commodities-trading fraud; Kenneth M. Maslak, 37, six counts of mail fraud and seven counts of commodities-trading fraud; and Matthew A. Newberger, 29, one count of mail fraud and one count of commodities-trading fraud.    Also pleading innocent were Joseph P. O'Malley, 38, six counts of mail and wire fraud and eight counts of commodities-trading fraud; Martin J. Riley, 31, one count of mail fraud and two counts of commodities-trading fraud; and Gary A. Wright, 28, seven counts of mail and wire fraud and 10 counts of commodities-trading fraud.    While the yen traders were entering their pleas, Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent Dietrich Volk, who posed as a yen trader to gather evidence against the indicted traders, sat quietly in the front of the courtroom. After the arraignments, Mr. Volk, dressed in a conservative blue blazer and khaki slacks, shared an elevator with Mr. Crouch and his attorney.    In the elevator Mr. Crouch looked at the gray-haired agent, who appears to be in his mid-30s, and said, &quot;You look like you put on weight.&quot;    &quot;A little bit,&quot; Mr. Volk replied, stepping out of the elevator and into the FBI's Chicago field office. </TEXT></DOC>
