WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis said Monday that GeorgeBush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes would present a$22,000-a-year tax break to the Republican candidate himself.   The Democratic nominee, pressing his assertion that a Bushpresidency would benefit the wealthiest Americans, said, ``GeorgeBush wants to give people like himself a tax break that's more, insome cases, than the average worker in California makes in a year.''   Dukakis campaigned the length of California during the day in abid for the state's most-in-the-nation 47 electoral votes. He alsowaged an effort to battle back nationally through televisioninterviews and purchases of network air time.   A new poll indicated he had his work cut out for him in thatstate. The poll, prepared for Tuesday's editions of the Los AngelesTimes, showed Bush leading 53 percent tp 42 percent.   The Times polled 1,376 registered voters during the fours daysthat ended Sunday. The margin of error was four percentage points.   In a speech to supporters at a half-filled Scottish Rite Templein Los Angeles, Dukakis renewed, in his sharpest terms yet, hiscriticism of Bush's proposal to reduce the tax rate on capitalgains from a maximum of 33 percent to 15 percent. Dukakis sayscapital gains _ profits gained from sales of property such asstocks or real estate _ are primarily a concern of the wealthy, andthat Bush's proposal is a break for the rich.   ``Consider a taxpayer who reported $515,132 in capital gainsover the last three years,'' Dukakis said. ``Suppose he reports thesame amount over the next three. If the vice president's new taxplan is accepted, that taxpayer will get an annual tax break ofmore than $22,000.   ``And what's the name of that taxpayer? George Herbert WalkerBush.''   Dukakis aides said the Democrat reported no capital gains duringthe past three years.   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said when asked aboutDukakis' comments: ``We're going to stick to our agenda and we'renot going to worry about ankle-biting by the opposition.''   Bush, in a speech delivered before Dukakis made his remarks,said in Portland, Maine, ``I will push for a cut in the capitalgains tax for a very simple reason: It's not to favor the rich; itwill help create jobs.''   He said, ``My opponent calls this typically a tax cut for therich. He's wrong. He's dead wrong.''   Dukakis struck a populist note in California, saying repeatedlythat he was fighting for average people.   The Massachusetts governor also pressed his contention that theBush campaign has distorted his record, recalling Mark Twain's linethat, ``A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truthis still putting on its shoes.''   ``Mr. Bush must have read Mark Twain,'' Dukakis said, ``becausehe's running a campaign based on distortions and distrations _ andoutright lies. Why? Because he can't win an election where the realissues are discussed.''   Later in San Diego, he repeated that theme as he spoke to acrowd estimated by police at 10,000 people at Horton Plaza.Spectators crowded elevated walkways and filled windows to catch aglimpse.   Dukakis shook hands along a sidewalk jammed with people, whereone enthusiastic woman outstretched her arm and stroked him on theback of the head in a show of affection _ prompting Secret Serviceagents to quickly move her arm away.   ``We've seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation andof outright lies now for many, many months,'' Dukakis told thecrowd in denouncing Republican campaigning.   Dukakis was accompanied in his campaigning by actress DarylHannah.   After appearances in Los Angeles, Burbank and San Diego, Dukakishad later appearances in the northern California cities of SanFrancisco, Hayward and San Leandro.   Aides said Dukakis would return next weekend to California, amust-win state for him.   Trailing in national polls, Dukakis said he believed Americanvoters were dissatisfied with the tenor of the campaign so far andwere ``ready to take a hard second look at George Bush and me.''   He was trying to take his case to voters through televisioninterviews. He was appearing on the Larry King show Monday night,in a segment taped two days earlier. On Tuesday night he was beinginterviewed live on ABC's ``Nightline'' program for 90 minutes.   On the Larry King show, Dukakkis said, ``Maybe with the benefitof hindsight, I should have tried to respond earlier'' to thenegative ads. He said the message about what candidates would dofor the future has been obscured ``by ads about furloughs andtanks.''   On the question of likability, he said, ``You can bepassionately competent.''   Press secretary Dayton Duncan said the Dukakis campaign hadpurchased five minutes of time Tuesday night on NBC, and would haveanother network appearance Sunday night and again the Saturdaybefore the election. Dukakis has purchased 30 minutes for electioneve on all three networks, Duncan said.</TEXT></DOC>
