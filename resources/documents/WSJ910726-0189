Power companies are finding that in the traditionalcoal-fired generators that pump out more than half thenation's electricity, tires burn hotter than coal and thusyield more power per pound. Tires also contain less sulfur, apollutant, than much of the coal used in the Midwest andEast.</LP><TEXT>   About 234 million tires a year are discarded, or roughlyone for each person in the U.S., the Enviromental ProtectionAgency estimates. Only a small percentage is put to any use.The rest go into huge piles, are illegally dumped or end upin garbage dumps. Though estimates vary widely, at least twobillion old tires are believed to be sitting around.   If all the nation's coal-fired generating plants used just1% tires as fuel, scrap-tire heaps could be eliminated by theyear 2000. &quot;It's a potential means to dispose of all the usedtires,&quot; says Charles W. Linderman of the Edison ElectricInstitute, a power-company trade association. Because of theindustry's vast incineration capacity, &quot;we can't ignore&quot; itspotential to help clean up waste problems, he adds.   So far, at least a half-dozen utilities are either using asmall percentage of tires in coal-fired plants or have plansto start soon. Ohio Edison Co. last month received stateapproval to burn as many as six million whole tires a year atits Toronto, Ohio, power plant. Otter Tail Power Co., basedin Fergus Falls, Minn., is burning about 50,000 tires,shredded into chunks, each week and wants to double thatamount.   Of course, tires could never replace coal; utilities burnmore than 750 million tons of coal a year. But the idea ofmixing in 1% to 10% of scrap tires with coal has raised thehopes of environmental officials because old tires are anincreasing threat to public health, the environment and tothe dwindling garbage-dump capacity.   Burning tires, however, could create yet anotherenviromental problem. Groups opposed to waste incineration,such as Greenpeace, argue that dioxins and other pollutantscould be released. &quot;Bad. An enviromental disaster,&quot; says JoeThornton, the group's incineration expert. But most federaland state officials are treating tires as just another fuel.So long as power plants live within their emission limits,officials won't challenge tire burning.   Recycling into new tires &quot;isn't viable,&quot; a Goodyear Tire andamp;Rubber Co. official contends. That's because today's tiresare a mixture of more than a dozen kinds of rubber, which aredifficult to separate.   And letting tires sit is hazardous. Big piles periodicallycatch fire, for instance, fouling the air and melting into atoxic goo that poisons ground water. A few tire piles thatcaught fire have been designated Superfund cleanup sites bythe EPA.   The most immediate threat, however, is fromdisease-transmitting insects. Because of their shape, tireshold water at any angle. &quot;For mosquitoes, it's a beautifulsite,&quot; says Robert J. Novak, a medical entomologist at theUniversity of Illinois who has studied the scrap-tire problemsince 1987.   North American varieties were bad enough, but in 1985 theAsian Tiger Mosquito arrived in Houston aboard a shipload ofused tires from Japan, Mr. Novak says. The shiny black andsilver mosquito is a carrier of dangerous strains ofencephalitis and Dengue Fever, better known as breakbonefever because joints tighten up until the victim literallyfeels as if his bones are breaking.   The insect has hitched rides all over the country ontire-carrying trucks and trains. &quot;It's only a matter oftime,&quot; Mr. Novak warns, before an outbreak of disease fromthe Asian Tiger Mosquito.   That threat is greatest in areas like Pembroke Township,south of Chicago, where landowners allowed millions of tiresto be dumped -- between five million and 20 million,depending on who is counting. The Asian Tiger Mosquito hasbeen spotted in Pembroke.   Utilities are Pembroke's best hope. Illinois Power Co., inDecatur, and Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago, are planningto add tires to the coal in at least one of each company'splants. So are Northern States Power Co., Minneapolis, andthe Wisconsin Power andamp; Light Co. unit of WPL Holdings Inc.,Madison.   But problems remain. While the tires are certainlyavailable, shredding capacity -- to turn them into chunkseasily mixed with coal -- isn't. Waste Management Inc., thenation's biggest garbage hauler, has 15 shredders and expectsto process 10 million tires this year. It sells most of thatas fuel to Otter Tail, to a cement-kiln operator and to papermills. Otter Tail says it pays about $21 a ton for tirechunks vs. $15 a ton for coal, but that tires are muchcheaper because they burn 2.5 times hotter.   But scrap tire chunks can be hard to handle. Rocks andstones can get mixed in. Also, tires are about 10% steel, andthe coal-feeding system can be clogged if the steel separatesfrom the rubber.   Ohio Edison's plan is novel because it drops whole tiresinto the top of its 80-foot-tall generator, instead ofshredding them and feeding chunks with the coal. Thegenerator is so hot that the tires combust before they reachbottom. The utility's hope is that it will not only save theshredding cost and energy, but will be able to charge peopleto accept their old tires, just as dump operators do.</TEXT></DOC>
