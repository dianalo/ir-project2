Newspapers are racing each other to praise the Olympics that areseen by Koreans as the turning point in the nation's transformationinto a leading industrial power.   ``Seoul Captivates World,'' ``Greatest Ever Show On Earth'' and``Closest Thing To Perfection,'' trumpeted banner headlines hailingthe Games.   Some newspapers predicted the Olympics could be a turning pointfor the entire world by helping to usher in peace andunderstanding. ``Curtain Rises On World In Harmony,'' proclaimedthe Chosun Ilbo.   The country's three main televison channels are carrying littlebut Olympic coverage from early morning until well past midnightwith important events repeated several times on each channel.   South Korean newspapers are devoting more than half their pagesto coverage of the Olympics with other news crowded onto back pagesas every facet of the Games is breathlessly recounted.   Seoul newspapers don't normally publish Monday morning or Sundayevening, but they are for the Olympics. Most papers have added upto eight extra pages to cope with Olympic coverage.   Local journalists say Olympic fever has swept their publicationswith editors and reporters striving to produce the best coverage.``We are so excited about this festival. Newspapers are justwriting everything that comes to mind,'' said a senior journalistwho demanded anonymity.   The press has also been taking a look at the foreign tourists intown for the Olympics. Most South Koreans have little experience offoreigners, and thousands of tourists have been an eye-catchingsight.   ``People, both Koreans and foreigners,'' began a story in TheKorean Herald. The story praised Koreans for their orderlybehavior, with the implication that foreigners were not so wellbehaved.   ``Korean spectators waited in long lines to enter stadiums in anorderly manner, showing a high sense of order,'' it said.   Newspapers have complained about foreigners selling Olympictickets, but without mentioning that Koreans are doing the samething.   Dong-a Ilbo lambasted some members of the International OlympicCommittee for being arrogant, claiming they refused to ride togroup events in buses and their wives were rude to Korean workers.   Chosun Ilbo noted the American team was the ``most free orliberal'' during the athletes parade in the opening ceremony.   Radical students, who demanded the Olympics be shared withcommunist North Korea, focused on the Americans in leaflets thatsaid, ``The ugliness of Yankees was fully displayed during theopening parade.''   But foreigners ready to praise South Korea and the staging ofthe Olympics are quickly singled out for media attention. ``Heavenprovided a glorious day like today for Koreans to demonstrate thestamina which has sustained them during so many dark years,'' oneAmerican was quoted as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
