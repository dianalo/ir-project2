The required notice would provide EPA with theinformation needed to evaluate an intended use and associated activities,and an opportunity to protect against potentially adverse exposure to 4-COT,4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT before it can occur. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding thisburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. SW., Washington,DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determinethat a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA mustmake this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors,including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a useof a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) ofTSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days beforethey manufacture, import, or process the substance for that use.Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirementsand EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices (PMNs)under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements includethe information submission requirements of section 5 (b) and (d)(1), theexemptions authorized by section 5(h) (1), (2), (3), and (5), and the regulationsat 40 CFR Part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatoryaction under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities forwhich it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>its reasons for not taking action.Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or finalSNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR Part707.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Applicability of General Provisions</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 5, 1984 (49 FR 35011), EPA promulgatedgeneral regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs (40 CFR Part 721, SubpartA). The general provisions are discussed in detail in that <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, and interested persons should refer tothat document for further information. On July 27, 1988, EPA promulgatedamendments to the general provisions (53 FR 28354) which would apply tothis proposed SNUR except as provided in proposed andSection; 721.462(b)(1).The entire text of Subpart A was published in that document; interestedparties should refer to it for further information.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of This Proposed Rule</ITAG>The chemical substances which are the subjects of this proposed SNUR arebenzenamine, 4-chloro-2-methyl- (4-COT, CAS Number 95-69-2); benzenamine,4-chloro-2-methyl-, hydrochloride (4-COT hydrochloride, CAS Number 3165-93-3);and benzenamine, 2-chloro-6-methyl- (6-COT, CAS Number 87-63-8). EPA isproposing to designate any use of these chemical substances as a significantnew use. Thus, this proposed rule would require persons who intend to manufacture,import, or process 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COT for any use tonotify EPA at least 90 days before such manufacture, import, or processing.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Background Information On 4-COT, 4-COT Hydrochloride, and 6-COT</ITAG>A.Production and Use Data4-COT, synonymously known as 4-chloro-2-methyl benzenamine, 4-chloro-o-toluidine,4-chloro-2-methylaniline, p-chloro-o-toluidine, 2-amino-5-chlorotoluene,5-chloro-2-amino toluene, azoic diazo component 11, 3-chloro-6-amino toluene,4-chloro-2-toluidine, and 4-chloro-6-methylanilin, has been used in thepast to produce azo dyes for cotton, silk, acetate, and nylon; as an intermediatefor the production of C.I. Pigment Red 7 and C.I. Pigment Yellow 49; andto produce chloridimeform, an insecticide used solely on cotton in theUnited States. 4-COT hydrocholride has been used in the past to produceazo dyes. 6-COT, also known as 2-chloro-6-methyl benzenamine and 6-chloro-o-toluidine,has been used in the past as a chemical intermediate.EPA reviewed the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory data base and otherinformation sources to identify current manufacturers, importers, and processorsof 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT. The review indicates that allproduction and importation of the chemical substances in the United Stateshas been discontinued. EPA contact with the last known U.S. producer of4-COT revealed that all U.S. production was discontinued in 1979 due tolow profits and demand, and all importation and distribution of the substancewas discontinued in 1986. It is not likely that 4-COT has been processedor used since early 1987. EPA review of the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventorydata base for 4-COT hydrochloride and 6-COT production revealed no productionor importation volume for either substance in 1977. Similarly, review ofproduction volume reported in response to the TSCA Inventory Update Rule(40 CFR Part 710, Subpart B) revealed no producers or importers of 4-COThydrochloride or 6-COT in 1986. Based on these data, EPA has concludedthat it is not likely that either 4-COT hydrochloride or 6-COT has beenprocessed or used for several years.B. Human Health EffectsA recent TSCA section 8(e) submission from a former manufacturer of 4-COTand 6-COT reported that 8 cases of human bladder cancer from an exposedgroup of 117 workers be linked to chronic exposure to the chemical substances.Inadequate data prevent a definitive conclusion as to which substance orsubstances produced the cause and effect relationship. However, other substanceshaving structures analogous to 4-COT and 6-COT present suspected humanhealth risks associated with exposure. For example, ortho-toluidine hydrochloride(CAS No. 636-21-5) is recognized as a carcinogen in experimental animalsby the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the NationalCancer Institute Bioassay Program. Moreover, the IARC Working Group hasstated that ortho-toluidine should be regarded, for practical purposes,as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to humans (see Unit X for draftChemical Hazard Information Profile on o-toluidine).Results from a 1978 National Cancer Institute bioassay indicate that exposureto 4-COT hydrochloride causes hemangiosarcoma and hemangioma in mice. Basedon these findings, the EPA Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) has classified4-COT as a ``Group 2'' probable human carcinogen (see Unit X for reference``Health and Environmental Effects Profile'' document). Because 4-COT hydrochloridecan be considered toxicologically equivalent to 4-COT, adverse human healtheffects of the base substance can be inferred from the hydrochloride, andvice versa. EPA at this time has no human health effects data definiteenough to permit a final conclusion to be drawn regarding human healthrisks for 6-COT. However, based on a through evaluation of the existinghealth data, EPA has concluded that 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COTmay present a risk of injury to human health.C. Past and Current Exposure DataEPA has little data on actual numbers of persons who have been exposedto 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COT, or at what levels. Current knownexposures are limited to those resulting from any residues or previouslymanufactured or imported 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT in the environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Objectives and Rationale For The Rule</ITAG>To determine what would constitute a significant new use of 4-COT, 4-COThydrochloride, and 6-COT, EPA considered relevant information on the toxicityof the substances, likely exposures associated with possible uses, andthe four factors listed in section 5(a)(2) of TSCA. Based on these considerations,EPA wishes to achieve the following objectives with regard to the significantnew use that is designated in this rule:1. EPA wants to ensure that it would receive notice of any company's intentto manufacture, import, or process 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COTfor any use before that activity begins. 2. EPA wants to ensure that it would have an opportunity to review andevaluate data submitted in a significant new use notice before the noticesubmitter begins manufacturing, importing, or processing 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride,or 6-COT for any use.3. EPA wants to ensure that it would be able to regulate prospective manufacturers,importers, or processors of 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT beforeany manufacturing, importing or processing of these substances occurs,provided that the degree of potential health and environmental risk issufficient to warrant such regulation.4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT are possible human carcinogens andare not currently not manufactured, imported, processed, or used in theU.S. according to data available to EPA. Neither 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride,nor 6-COT is currently subject to any Federal regulation that would notifythe Federal Government of activities that might result in adverse exposuresto these substances or provide a regulatory mechanism that could protecthuman health from potentially adverse exposures before they occurred.EPA believes that the resumption of any use of these substances, and theirrelated manufacture, import, or processing, has a high potential to increasethe magnitude and duration of exposure to these substances from that whichcurrently exists. Given the toxicity and potential toxicity of these substances,the reasonably anticipated situations that could result in exposure, andthe lack of sufficient regulatory controls, individuals could be exposedto 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COT at levels which may result in adverseeffects. For the foregoing reasons, EPA has designate any use of 4-COT,4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT as a significant new use.Because EPA is concerned about potential exposure during the entire lifecycle of 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT, EPA is proposing to modifyandSection; 721.5(a)(2) to require any prospective manufacturer, importer,or processor of 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COT, who intends to distributethe substance in commerce, to submit a notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Alternatives</ITAG>Before proposing this SNUR, EPA considered the following alternative regulatoryactions for 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT:1. One alternative would be to promulgate a section 8(a) reporting rulefor these substances. Under such a rule, EPA could require any person toreport information to EPA when they intend to manufacture, import, or processthe substances for any use. However, for these particular substances, theuse of section 8(a) rather than SNUR authority would have several drawbacks.First, EPA would not receive sufficient advance notification of the intendedactivity, nor would it be able to take immediate follow-up regulatory actionunder section 5(e) or 5(f) to prohibit or limit the activity. In addition,EPA may not receive important information from small businesses, becausesuch firms are exempt from section 8(a) reporting requirements. In viewof the level of health concern for 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT,EPA believes that a section 8(a) rule for these substances would not meetEPA's regulatory objectives.2. Regulate the substances under section 6 of TSCA. However, EPA may regulateunder section 6 only if there is a reasonable basis to conclude that themanufacture, importation, processing, distribution in commerce, use, ordisposal of a substance or mixture ``presents or will present'' an unreasonablerisk of injury to human health or the environment. There is insufficientinformation about prospective manufacturing, importation, or processingoperations or human health effects at this time to enable EPA to make aconclusive determination of risk. Therefore, EPA is not able at this timeto take action under section 6 to regulate 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride,or 6-COT.<ITAG tagnum="85">VII. Applicability of Proposed Rule To Uses Occurring Before Promulgationof Final Rule</ITAG>EPA believes that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designatinga use as a significant new use as of the proposal date of the SNUR ratherthan as of the promulgation of the final rule. If uses begun during theproposal period of a SNUR were considered ongoing as of the date of promulgation,it would be difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements, becauseany person could defeat the SNUR by initiating the proposed significantnew use before the rule became final; this interpretation of section 5would make it extremely difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements.Persons who begin commercial manufacture, importation, or processing of4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, or 6-COT for a significant new use designatedin this rule between proposal and promulgation of the SNUR may comply withthis proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet theconditions of advance compliance as codified at andSection; 721.45(h) (53FR 28354, July 27, 1988), the person will be considered to have met therequirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begincommercial manufacture, importation, or processing of the substance betweenproposal and promulgation of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advancecompliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date ofthe rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to complywith all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the noticereview period, including all extensions, expires. EPA recognizes that thisinterpretation of TSCA may disrupt the commercial activities of personswho begin manufacturing, importing, or processing 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride,or 6-COT for a significant new use during the proposal period of this SNUR.However, this proposed rule constitutes notice of that potential disruption,and persons who commence the proposed significant new use prior to promulgationof the SNUR do so at their own risk.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Economic Analysis</ITAG>EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new usenotice requirements for potential manufacturers, importers, and processorsof 4-COT, 4-COT hydrochloride, and 6-COT. EPA's complete economic analysisis available in the public record for this proposed rule (OPTS-50567).<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information</ITAG>Any person who submits comments claimed as confidential business informationmust mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or otherappropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the timeof submission will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked asconfidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFRPart 2. EPA requests that any party submitting confidential comments prepareand submit a public version of the comments that EPA can place in the publicfile.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control numberOPTS-50567). The record includes basic information considered by EPA indeveloping this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with additionalinformation as it is received. The record now includes the following:1. This proposed rule.2. The economic analysis of this proposed rule.3. Draft Health and Environmental Effects Profile for 4-chloro-2-methylbenzenamine and 4-chloro-2-methyl benzenamine hydrochloride.4. TSCA section 8(e) submission (8EHQ-0986-0634 et seq.).5. Draft Chemical Hazard Information Profile for o-toluidine.EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at anytime between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPAwill identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation.A public version of this record containing nonconfidential copies is availablefor reviewing and copying from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,except legal holidays, in the TSCA Public Docket Office, located at RoomNE-G004, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Regulatory Assessment Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule would not be a ``major'' rule because it wouldnot have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, and it wouldnot have a significant effect on competition, costs, or prices. While thereis no precise way to calculate the total annual cost of compliance withthis rule, EPA estimates that the reporting cost for submitting a significantnew use notice would be approximately $1,400 to $8,000. EPA believes that,because of the nature of the rule and the substances involved, there wouldbe few significant new use notices submitted. Furthermore, while the expenseof a notice and the uncertainty of possible EPA regulation may discouragecertain innovation, that impact would be limited because such factors areunlikely to discourage an innovation that has high potential value.This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affectedby this rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects toreceive few SNUR notices for the substances. Therefore, the Agency believesthat the number of small businesses affected by this rule would not besubstantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisproposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0038.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and competingand reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721</ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous materials, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Significant new uses.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 31, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
