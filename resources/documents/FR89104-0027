Background </ITAG>On February 4, 1987, Congress enacted the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA),which amends the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Water Quality Act makes a numberof adjustments to the NPDES program. Many of the changes necessitate revisions to the NPDES regulations. Thisrule contains changes which incorporate specific provisions from the WaterQuality Act into existing NPDES regulations. Today's rulemaking also makesrevisions to the NPDES regulations in response to recent court decisionsby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In addition to today's final rule, EPA is also preparing companion rulemakingswhich will propose modifications to existing regulations to implement otherprovisions of the WQA and court orders. These companion proposals willsupplement the new provisions, as well as codify the remaining statutorylanguage. EPA has codified in this rulemaking only those statutory provisionswhich can stand alone and out of context. In some cases, implementationof specific provisions of the WQA amendments will involve both codificationof explicit statutory requirements and notice and comment rulemaking toimplement those parts of the statute where the Agency has discretion toact. Where these are inextricably intertwined, EPA has decided to defercodification in favor of a combined notice and comment rulemaking. Thiswill avoid confusion which may arise from a piecemeal approach. Becausethe principal purpose of today's rule is to codify the new statutory requirementsof the WQA, today's rulemaking is properly classified as an interpretiverule, <T3>see, United Technologies Corporation v. EPA, </T3>821 F. 2d 714, 718(D.C. Cir. 1987), in that it ``simply states what (EPA) thinks the [underlying]statute means and only `reminds' affected parties of existing duties.''quoting <T3>Citizens to Save Spencer County v. EPA, </T3>600 F. 2d, 844, 876 n.153 (D.C. Cir. 1979). It does not intend ``to create new law, rights orduties.'' <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">If the rule is based on specific statutory provisions, and its validitystands or falls on the correctness of the agency's interpretation of thoseprovisions, it is an interpretative rule. If, however, the rule is basedon an agency's power to exercise its judgment as to how best to implementa general statutory mandate, the rule is likely a legislative one. <T3>United Technologies, supra, </T3>at 719-20.</ITAG>Today's final rule conforms to the Court's definition of an interpretativerule by revising existing regulations to implement the new statutory provisions.In most instances, EPA has codified the relevant statutory language. EPArecognizes that many of these provisions raise interpretive questions.EPA has avoided adding regulatory language to resolve interpretive questions.This is in keeping with EPA's view that the principal purpose of today'srule is to codify the new statutory requirements. EPA has articulated inthe preamble, however, its view of what Congress intended these new requirementsto be. Such statements of statutory interpretation are derived from legislativehistory and EPA's view of Congressional purposes for the new requirements.The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) specifically excludes ``interpretative''rules from its notice and comment procedures. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) (1982).In addition, while EPA recognizes the importance of public comment in itsrulemaking activity, the Agency believes that notice and comment is unnecessarybecause the ``good cause'' exception to the APA notice and comment requirementis applicable. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551, <T3>et seq., </T3>specifically recognizes that there will be situationswhere an administrative agency need not go through a round of public commentbefore issuing a rule. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), a rule is exempt fromnotice and public comment requirements ``when the agency for good causefinds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons thereforin the rules issued) that notice and public procedures thereon are impractical,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The Administrative Conference of the United States has summarized the caselaw on the issue of the ``good cause'' exemption, saying in relevant partthat the exemption is warranted where: ``* * * delay in promulgation willcause an injurious inconsistency between an agency rule and a newly enactedstatute or judicial decision.'' ACUS Rec. 83-2: The ``Good Cause'' Exemptionfrom APA Rulemaking Requirements, 1 CFR Part 305.83-2 (1984). EPA believes the good cause exemption from the notice and comment requirementsof the EPA is properly invoked here for the following reasons. The limitedobjective of this rule is to assure that the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) accurately reflects the current requirements of the Water QualityAct. This serves important public policy and regulatory objectives. Iteliminates any confusion on the part of the regulated community, whichrelies on the CFR as an accurate reflection of the controlling statutoryrequirements. It assures that the regulated community is aware of the newrequirements and fully understands the impact of the requirements uponpermitted facilities. In addition, many permits include citations to specificprovisions of the federal regulations. Many State regulatory programs aremodeled after EPA's regulations; some States even incorporate EPA's regulationsby reference.  Today's rulemaking will eliminate many questions concerning implementationof the WQA, and will clarify in a number of areas which parts of the existingregulations are superseded by new requirements. Moreover, it is essential to the Agency's enforcement program that theCFR accurately reflect the statutory requirements imposed on the regulatedcommunity by the WQA. Immediate codification of WQA requirements will putregulated parties on notice of their legal responsibilities and potentialliabilities, without the potential for confusion that might arise in theevent that a conflict is perceived between the requirements of the Actand those contained in the CFR. By reducing confusion about the programand clarifying permittees' responsibilities under the CWA, EPA is ultimatelyserving the basic purposes of the statute_the protection of human healthand the environment. It also promotes certainty and encourages effortsby responsible segments of the regulated community to move ahead to meettheir responsibilities. By the same token, it prevents other members ofthe regulated community from using confusion as an excuse not to complywith the law. For the reasons discussed above, EPA has concluded that to the extent thisrule is deemed a legislative rule rather than an interpretive rule thereis good cause to issue it without receiving public comment in accordancewith 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), because under the circumstances, notice and commentprocedures would be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the publicinterest. For the same reasons, EPA believes that it has good cause tomake today's rule immediately effective, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Analysis of Regulatory Changes</ITAG>A. Definitions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Point Source</ITAG>Prior to passage of the WQA, the definition of ``point source'' in theCWA was very broad, encompassing any discharge of pollutants from a ``discernible,confined and discrete conveyance.'' EPA has in practice interpreted thisdefinition to include landfill leachate collection systems, since theychannel runoff from landfills. Section 507 of the WQA confirmed EPA's interpretationby amending the statutory definition of point source to explicitly includelandfill leachate collection systems. Accordingly, today's rulemaking revisesEPA's existing definition of point source in andSection;122.2 by insertingthe phrase ``landfill leachate collection system.''<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Agricultural Storm Water Discharges</ITAG>Section 503 of the WQA amended section 502(14) of the CWA to expresslyexclude from the definition of point source agricultural storm water discharges.Thus, these discharges are not subject to NPDES permit requirements. Today'srule amends the existing definition of point source in andSection;122.2 toincorporate this statutory exclusion.EPA's regulations had previously excluded certain agricultural and silviculturaldischarges, which EPA defined as non-point, from the requirement to obtainan NPDES permit (see andSection;122.3(e)). This exclusion had been challengedby the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in <T3>NRDC v. EPA, </T3>No. 80-1607 (filed June 3, 1980) as being beyondEPA's authority. In view of the new statutory exclusion for agriculturalstorm water discharges, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit dismissed NRDC's challenge to andSection;122.3(e) as moot.Today's revision clarifies that the exclusion in andSection;122.3(e) includesagricultural and silvicultural storm water discharges. Silvicultural pointsource discharges under andSection;122.27 are still required to obtain NPDESpermits. For consistency, EPA is also adding a reference to andSection;122.3(e)in the definition of point source.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. State</ITAG>Section 502 of the WQA amends the definition of ``State'' in andSection;502(3)of the CWA to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.The rule promulgated today implements this statutory provision by revisingEPA's existing definition in 40 CFR 122.2 and 124.2 to include the Commonwealthof the Northern Mariana Islands. The Northern Marianas will be treatedlike any State under the Clean Water Act and can apply to administer theNPDES program.B. Storm Water Permit RequirementsSections 401 and 405 of the WQA address the NPDES permit program for stormwater discharges and amend section 402 of the CWA by modifying paragraph(1) and adding a new paragraph (p). Today's rule incorporates both thestatutory language of section 402(1)(2) relating to storm water runofffrom oil, gas, and mining operations as well as the provisions of section402(p)(1)-(p)(3) regarding municipal and industrial storm water discharges.This rulemaking codifies these WQA amendments as new regulatory provisionsat andSection;122.26. The previous storm water provisions at andSection;122.26and accompanying deadline provisions at andSection;122.21(c)(2) were recentlywithdrawn by the Agency in response to a D.C. Circuit Court of Appealsorder in <T3>NRDC v. EPA, </T3>No. 80-1607 (December 4, 1987) (See 53 FR 4157, February12, 1988). EPA has recently proposed NPDES application and designationrequirements for storm water discharges under sections 402(p) (4) and (6)at 53 FR 49416 (December 7, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 402(1)(2)</ITAG>Section 402(1)(2) prohibits EPA from requiring an NPDES permit for dischargesof storm water runoff from mining operations or oil and gas exploration,production, processing, or treatment operations or transmission facilities,composed entirely of flows which are from conveyances or systems of conveyances(including but not limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) usedfor collecting and conveying precipitation runoff and, which are not contaminatedby contact with, or do not come into contact with, any overburden, rawmaterial, intermediate products, finished product, byproduct or waste productslocated on the site of such operations. Today's rule codifies this limitationon NPDES permitting authority at andSection;122.26(a)(3).The legislative history accompanying this provision explains that ``[w]ithrespect to oil or grease or hazardous substances, the determination ofwhether storm water is contaminated by contact with such materials, asestablished by the Administrator, shall take into consideration whetherthese materials are present in such storm water runoff in excess of reportablequantities under section 311 of the Clean Water Act or section 102 of theComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of1980 or in the case of mining operations, above natural background levels.''(Conference Report, H 10574 <T3>Cong. Rec., </T3>(daily ed. Oct. 15, 1986). The Agency will addressthe scope of this provision in future rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 402(p)</ITAG>Section 402(p) contains a number of important provisions and requirementsrelating to the issuance of NPDES permits for municipal and industrialstorm water discharges. Today's rule codifies subsection 402(p)(1) at andSection;122.26and provides that neither federally-administered nor approved State NPDESprograms may require a permit for discharges composed entirely of stormwater prior to October 1, 1992, unless the discharge falls within a listof five exceptions set forth in subsection 402(p)(2). These exceptionsare also codified in today's rule and include the following storm waterdischarges:(A) A discharge with respect to which a permit has been issued prior toFebruary 4, 1987;(B) A discharge associated with industrial activity;(C) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving apopulation of 250,000 or more;(D) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving apopulation of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000; or (E) A discharge which the Administrator or the State, as the case may be,determines contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or isa significant contributor of pollutants to the waters of the United States.The last exception at 402(p)(2)(E) provides the Administrator or the State,as the case may be, with authority to designate storm water dischargesfor a permit on a case-by-case basis. This authority can be used to requirea designated storm water discharge associated with industrial activityor a discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving a populationof greater than 100,000 to obtain a permit prior to the development ofpermit application requirements for the particular class of storm waterdischarges in question. In addition, the authority applies to designatedstorm water discharges that are not otherwise required to obtain a permitprior to October 1, 1992 under section 402(p)(1).In determining that a storm water discharge contributes to a violationof a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States for the purpose of a designation under Section402(p)(2)(E) of the amended CWA, the legislative history for the WaterQuality Act provides that ``EPA or the State should use any available waterquality or sampling data to determine whether the latter two criteria [ofsection 402(p)(2)(E)] are met, and should require additional sampling asnecessary to determine whether on not these criteria are met.'' ConferenceReport, <T3>Cong. Rec. </T3>S16443 (daily ed. October 16, 1986). In accordancewith this legislative history, EPA intends to require designated stormwater dischargers to submit permit applications in accordance with therequirements of 40 CFR 122.21. The Agency will consider a number of factorswhen determining whether a storm water discharge is a significant contributorof pollutants to the waters of the United States. These factors include:the location of the discharge with respect to waters of the United States;the size of the discharge; the quantity and nature of the pollutants reachingwaters of the United States; and any other relevant factors. As noted above,EPA has proposed a rulemaking to address NPDES application and designationrequirements for storm water discharges. These factors are included inthat rulemaking. Until EPA conducts additional rulemaking under andSection; 405 of the WaterQuality Act, case-by-case designations of storm water discharges requiringa permit will be modeled on existing regulatory procedures found at andSection;124.52 [for permits required on a case-by-case basis]. The procedures atandSection; 124.52 require the Regional Administrator to notify the dischargerin writing of the decision that the discharge requires a permit and thereasons for the decision. In addition, an application form is to be sentwith the notice. Deadlines for submitting permit applications will be establishedon a case-by-case basis. Although the 60 day period provided for submittinga permit application under andSection; 124.52 may be appropriate for manydesignated storm water discharges, additional time may be necessary dependingupon site specific factors. For example, due to the complexities associatedwith determining whether a municipal, separate storm sewer system requiresa permit, the Regional Administrator may provide the applicant with additionaltime to submit relevant information or may require that information besubmitted in several phases. The WQA also adds subsection 402(p)(3)(B)(i) to clarify that permits formunicipal storm sewer discharges may be issued on a system or jurisdiction-widebasis. Today's rule codifies this clarification at andSection; 122.26(a)(2).A number of other provisions of Section 402 are not being codified in today'srule but still warrant discussion.Section 402(p)(4) requires EPA to promulgate final regulations governingstorm water application requirements for storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity and discharges from municipal storm sewer systemsserving a population of 250,000 or more by ``no later than two years''after the date of enactment (i.e., no later than February 4, 1989). Thisprovision also requires EPA to promulgate final regulations governing stormsewer permit application requirements for discharges from municipal separatestorm sewer systems serving a population of 100,000 or more but less than250,000 by ``no later than four years'' after enactment (i.e., no laterthan February 4, 1991). In addition, section 402(p)(4) provides that permit applications for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity and large municipalseparate storm sewer systems ``shall be filed no later than three years''after the date of enactment of the WQA (i.e., no later than February 4,1990). Permit applications for discharges from medium-sized municipal systemsmust be filed ``no later than five years'' after enactment (i.e., no laterthan February 4, 1992). NPDES permits for all other storm water discharges are not required untilOctober 1, 1992, unless a permit for the discharge was issued prior tothe date of enactment of the WQA (i.e., February 4, 1987), or the dischargeis determined to be a significant contributor of pollutants to waters ofthe United States or is contributing to a violation of a water qualitystandard. In addition, EPA, in consultation with the States, is required under section402(p)(5) to conduct two studies on storm water discharges. The first studywill identify those storm water discharges or classes of storm water dischargesfor which permits are not required prior to October 1, 1992 and determine,to the maximum extent practicable, the nature and extent of pollutantsin such discharges. This study was due by October 1, 1988. The second studywill establish procedures and methods to control storm water dischargesto the extent necessary to mitigate impacts on water quality. This studywas due by October 1, 1989. Based on the two studies, EPA, in consultationwith State and local officials, is required to issue regulations by nolater than October 1, 1992 which designate additional storm water dischargesto be regulated to protect water quality and establish a comprehensiveprogram to regulate such designated sources. The program must, at a minimum,(A) establish priorities, (B) establish requirements for State storm watermanagement programs, and (C) establish expeditious deadlines. The programmay include performance standards, guidelines, guidance, and managementpractices and treatment requirements, as appropriate.C. Deadline Extensions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Compliance Dates</ITAG>Section 301 in the WQA revises the compliance deadlines in andSection; 301of the CWA for the technology-based requirements of the CWA. The NPDESregulations in andSection; 125.3 currently reflect compliance deadline requirementsprior to the WQA. Under the existing rules, the compliance date for limitsbased on best practicable control technology currently available (BPT)is the date of permit issuance. For conventional pollutants subject tolimitations based upon best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT)and for all toxic pollutants identified under CWA section 307(a) (listedat 40 CFR 401.15) and subject to limitations based upon best availabletechnology economically achievable (BAT), compliance was required by July1, 1984. For all other toxic pollutants subject to effluent limitationsbased on BAT, compliance was required no later than three years after thedate such effluent limitations were incorporated into an NPDES permit.For BAT effluent limitations on other pollutants (i.e. nonconventionals),compliance was required no later than three years after the date such effluentlimitations were incorporated into an NPDES permit, or July 1, 1984, whicheverwas later, but in no case later than July 1, 1987.The WQA revises certain deadlines for compliance with permits containingeffluent limitations based upon BPT, BAT and BCT. Compliance with permiteffluent limitations established based on BAT or BCT is required as expeditiouslyas practicable but in no case later than three years after the date suchlimitations are instituted, and in no case later than March 31, 1989.The deadline for BPT effluent limitations continues to be July 1, 1977.However, the WQA sets a later deadline where EPA promulgates an effluentlimitation after January 1, 1982 and the revised limitation requires alevel of control substantially greater or is based on fundamentally differentcontrol technology than required in permits issued for the industrial categoryprior to January 1, 1982. Compliance for this second category of BPT effluentlimitations is required as expeditiously as practicable, but in no caselater than three years after the date such limitations are promulgatedunder section 304(b) and in no case later than March 31, 1989.For permits based upon best professional judgment (BPJ) issued after enactmentof the WQA (February 4, 1987), compliance is required as expeditiouslyas practicable but in no case later than three years after the date suchlimitations are established, and in no case later than March 31, 1989.For BPJ permits issued before enactment of the WQA, compliance continuesto be required in accordance with the Section 301(b)(1)(A), 301(b)(2)(A)and 301(b)(2)(E) deadlines in effect when the permit was issued.Today's rule implements the statutory amendment by revising EPA's existingandSection; 125.3(a)(2)(i)-(v) to extend the compliance deadline for eachof the above mentioned categories.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. POTW Application Deadline</ITAG>Section 304 of the WQA reopens, for 180 days after enactment, the deadlinefor POTWs to apply under section 301(i)(1) of the CWA for extensions ofthe 1978 date by which secondary treatment and water quality standardsin effect prior to 1977, must be achieved. The Administrator may extendthis compliance deadline until no later than July 1, 1988. Many eligiblePOTWs applied for the 301(i) extension in 1977 and 1978. Congress enactedsection 304 of the WQA to allow POTWs that did not apply in a timely mannerfor a 301(i) extension another chance to submit an application. Treatmentworks on a compliance schedule established by a court order or final Agency(or State) order prior to February 4, 1987 were not eligible to apply foran extension under WQA section 304.Even though the deadline for this extension is past, EPA is amending theexisting regulations to conform to the statute in Section 301(i). Thiswill assure that the regulations accurately reflect the statute. This statutoryprovision is implemented in today's rule by revising existing andSection;andSection;122.21(n)(2) and 122.21(m)(3). Section 122.21(n)(2) is revised to changethe POTW filing deadline for a 301(i)(1) extension, from June 26, 1978to August 3, 1987. Thus, the change in the application deadline effectivelychanges andSection; 122.21(m)(3) by reopening the time period in which anindustrial facility planning to discharge through a municipal treatmentworks that has requested an extension under 301(i) can apply for a 301(i)(2)extension. The deadline for these industrial dischargers is extended toJanuary 30, 1988 (180 days after the POTW can request a 301(i) extensionfor delay in construction under andSection; 122.21(n)(2)).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Innovative Technology</ITAG>This codification incorporates WQA changes with respect to facilities proposingto use innovative technology to meet applicable BAT effluent limitations.Prior to passage of the WQA, the deadline for compliance with such effluentlimitations by facilities using innovative technology under andSection; 301(k)of the CWA was July 1, 1987. This date is currently found at 40 CFR 125.21,125.23, 125.24 and 125.27. Section 305 of the WQA amends section 301(k)of the CWA, to allow the Administrator (or the State with an approved program,in consultation with the Administrator) to establish a date for complianceno later than 2 years after the date for compliance with the effluent limitationwhich would otherwise be applicable. This codification changes andSection;andSection;125.21, 125.23, 125.24, and 125.27 to reflect the statutory change.Prior to the 1987 amendments, the 301(k) deadline extension was availableonly for compliance with BAT limits. Many facilities subject to BAT alsowere required to meet limits for conventional pollutants based upon bestconventional pollutant control technology (BCT) and used the same treatmentequipment in meeting both limits. These facilities were essentially barredfrom obtaining 301(k) extensions because of the requirement to meet BCT.The WQA expands the scope of section 301(k) to allow an extension wherethe permittee is using innovative technology for compliance with BCT. EPAis not, however, revising Subpart C of Part 125 to reflect these changesin today's rulemaking. These revisions will be addressed along with a numberof additional issues in connection with section 301(k) in subsequent noticeand comment rulemaking. In that rulemaking, EPA plans to define the term``significantly greater effluent reduction'' for purposes of BCT. As partof that rulemaking, EPA also plans to propose regulations addressing theamendment to section 307(e) of the CWA (andSection; 309 WQA) which authorizesa compliance deadline extension for indirect dischargers who install aninnovative technology. In addition, EPA will address specific substantivecriteria for evaluating 301(k) compliance extensions. EPA proposed thesecriteria in 1985 pursuant to a remand in <T3>NRDC v. EPA, </T3>No. 84-1500 (D.C. Circuit, April 16, 1985). See 50FR 49904, December 5, 1985. That earlier proposal was not finalized, however,and will be reproposed as part of the upcoming more general notice andcomment rulemaking.<T3>D. Industrial Variances</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Note on Fundamentally Different Factors Variances</ITAG>Regulations establishing Fundamentally Different Factors (FDF) variancesfor BPT, BAT, BCT, and PSES are found at 40 CFR 125, Subpart D and 40 CFR403.13. In the WQA, the Congress established an explicit statutory schemefor FDFs, as applied to BAT, BCT and PSES. In a future rulemaking, EPAintends to propose amendments to the substantive criteria for FDF variancesconsistent with the requirements of section 301(n) of the CWA for direct(40 CFR Part 125, Subpart D) and indirect (40 CFR 403.13) dischargers.The Agency will also address the regulatory authority for granting variancesfrom BPT. However, because the legislative history of the WQA indicatedthat Congress intended the FDF variance provisions to be self-implementing(Conference Report, 132 H.10567, <T3>Cong. Rec.,</T3> Oct. 15, 1986) EPA is using the new FDF statutorycriteria under section 306 of the WQA, when appropriate, on a case-by-casebasis in addressing FDF variance requests.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Application Requirements for Fundamentally Different Factors VarianceRequests</ITAG>The existing NPDES regulation at andSection; 122.21(m)(1) requires that aFundamentally Different Factors (FDF) variance request be submitted bythe close of the public comment period on the draft permit. The existingfiling deadline will continue to be used for FDF variance requests fromBPT effluent guidelines. However, where variances are requested from bestavailable technology economically achievable (BAT) and best conventionalpollutant control technology (BCT), the WQA establishes a new filing deadlinein section 301(n)(2) of the CWA. The statute requires submission of anFDF application within 180 days after the date that the limitation fromwhich the variance is sought is established or revised; EPA considers thedate of the establishment of such limitation as the date the guidelineor standard is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This is consistent with the Conference Report(132 H.10566, Oct. 15, 1986) which states that ``an application under thissection shall be submitted within 180 days after the publication of theinitial guideline or standard'' and EPA's handling of requests for reliefunder sections 301(c) and 301(g) of the Act (40 CFR 122.21(m)(2)) within270 days after promulgation of an effluent guideline.The statute is not clear when BAT and BCT FDF variance requests are duefor those effluent guidelines established or revised before February 4,1987. Such facilities previously were guided by EPA's regulations which,as stated above, allowed FDF requests to be submitted by the close of thepublic comment period on the draft permit. EPA will provide a period, notto exceed 180 days after publication of this final rule, to allow suchfacilities to file a request. (Only facilities for which the previouslyapplicable filing deadline has not passed can make these FDF requests.The previously applicable filing deadline is the close of the draft permit'scomment period.) This time period mirrors the time period for filing establishedby the statute, and will allow those whose time period to file a FDF variancerequest has not otherwise passed an opportunity to file such a request.EPA has modified the second sentence of the previously applicable provisionand designated the sentence as andSection; 122.21(m)(1)(ii), to indicatethat FDF variance requests shall explain how applicable regulatory and/orstatutory criteria are satisfied.The general pretreatment regulations at 40 CFR 403.13(g) previously alsocontained application deadlines for FDF variance requests for indirectdischargers. Therefore, EPA has made changes to these regulations, as well,to reflect the statutory provision. Included in these changes is the provisionrequiring the submission of an application within 180 days after the datean applicable categorical pretreatment standard is established or revised.As indicated above, EPA considers the date of the establishment as thedate the standard is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; this is a change from the previous regulatoryrequirement which was based upon the effective date of the categoricalpretreatment standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Availability of Section 301(g) Variances</ITAG>Section 302 of the WQA modified section 301(g) of the CWA to limit section301(g) variance requests to five specific non-conventional pollutants (ammonia,chlorine, color, iron and total phenols (4AAP) (when the Administratordetermines total phenols to be a pollutant covered by CWA section 301(b)(2)(F)).Additional non-conventional pollutants may be added to this group by theAdministrator in response to petitions, under a new listing procedure specifiedin section 301(g)(4) of the CWA. Section 122.21(m)(2) is being revisedto reflect this amendment. The current regulation does not list the fivespecific non-conventional pollutants and allows variances ``pursuant tosection 301(g) of the CWA, because of certain environmental considerations,when those requirements were based on effluent guidelines.'' The WQA didnot revise application deadlines for section 301(g) applications whichare based on section 301(j)(1)(B) of the CWA.It has been brought to the Agency's attention that Congress did not specifyhow the time limit for filing the petitions for listing referenced abovewas to be applied to currently-pending 301(g) variance requests. EPA isonly aware of one pending 301(g) variance application which requested relieffor a non-conventional pollutant which was not one of the five listed pollutants.EPA will deal with this, and any other dischargers in a similarly situatedposition, on a case-by-case basis.The WQA specifies deadlines for EPA decisionmaking. For example, section301(j)(4) requires EPA to make a final decision on 301(g) applicationswithin 365 days of filing a submission under 301(g). Because an applicationmay be filed without being complete, the deadline for decisionmaking couldpass without a complete application ever being filed. It is only logicalto imply a deadline for completion of the application before EPA's decisionmust be made. Therefore, EPA is revising andSection; 122.21(m)(2)(i)(B) toclarify that the complete application must be filed in sufficient time,as determined by the Regional Division Director, to allow compliance withthe decision timing requirement contained in section 301(j)(4) of the CWA.Generally, this period will require submission of the complete applicationno later than 180 days before the deadline for EPA to issue a decision.EPA notes that it proposed, but has not to date finalized, substantivecriteria regulations (40 CFR Part 125, Subpart F) for section 301(g) onAugust 7, 1984 (49 FR 31462).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. State Concurrence on Fundamentally Different Factors and Section301(g) Variances</ITAG>Sections 301(g) and 301(n) of the CWA require State concurrence on sections301(g) and 301(n) variance approvals. The NPDES regulations at andSection;124.62(e) are being revised to indicate that EPA will act on FDF or 301(g)variance requests which have been submitted to the State Director onlyafter approval of the request by the State Director. EPA notes that inthe case of a State that does not have the NPDES program, the variancerequest should be submitted to EPA, which will then forward the requestto the appropriate State agency for concurrence; State concurrence mustbe obtained before EPA can approve either a 301(g) or 301(n) variance.The general pretreatment regulation at andSection; 403.13(k) does not authorizea State Director to forward a FDF variance request for an indirect dischargerwithout a recommendation of approval, which EPA interprets to be the State'sconcurrence. Therefore, no change has been made to this provision. EPAagain notes that in the case of a State that is not approved to administerthe pretreatment program, State concurrence must be obtained before EPAwill finally approve the FDF variance request.E. PenaltiesThe WQA makes a number of changes to the civil and criminal penalty provisionsof the CWA and adds an administrative penalty provision. The WQA adds CWAandSection; 405 to the list of sections for which criminal penalties areapplicable, and confirms the availability of civil and criminal penaltiesfor violations of pretreatment requirements. Section 313 of the WQA amendsCWA andSection; 309(d) to provide that violators of CWA sections 301, 302,306, 307, 308, 318 or 405, or any condition or limitation in an NPDES permit,or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under section402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8), are subject to a maximum civil penalty of ``$25,000per day for each violation,'' in contrast to the previous maximum of ``$10,000per day of such violation.''Section 312 of the WQA amends section 309(c)(1) of the CWA, increasingthe penalty for any person who negligently violates section 301, 302, 306,307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitationimplementing any of these sections in an NPDES permit, or any requirementimposed in a pretreatment program under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8).Negligent violations of these provisions are subject to criminal penaltiesof $2,500 to $25,000 per day of violation or up to one year in prison,or both. A second offense under these provisions may be subject to penaltiesof not more than $50,000 per day of violation or imprisonment of up totwo years, or both.Section 312 of the WQA also amends section 309(c) of the CWA by increasingthe criminal penalties for knowing violations of sections 301, 302, 306,307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitationimplementing any such section in an NPDES permit, or any requirement imposedin a pretreatment program under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8). Knowingviolations of these provisions are subject to criminal penalties of $5,000to $50,000 per day of violation or up to three years in prison, or both.A second offense under these paragraphs may be subject to penalties ofnot more than $100,000 per day of violation or imprisonment of up to sixyears, or both.The WQA also creates a new class of knowing violations. In the event ofa knowing violation placing another person in imminent danger of deathor serious bodily injury, individuals are subject to penalties of up to15 years in prison or fines of up to $250,000, or both. Organizations aresubject to fines of up to $1 million. Individuals committing a second offenseunder this paragraph may be subject to penalties of not more than $500,000or 30 years in prison, or both. Organizations are subject to fines of upto $2 million. Section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CWA defines the term ``organization''for the purpose of this provision.Section 314 of the WQA adds section 309(g) to the CWA. This provision allowsthe Administrator to assess administrative penalties against persons violatingsection 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of this Act, or any permitcondition or limitation implementing any such section in a permit issuedunder section 402. Section 314 also provides administrative penalty authorityfor violations of State-issued permits under CWA section 404. Today's rulemaking,however, does not address penalty authority for violations of section 404.Section 314 creates two classes of penalties. Penalties for Class I violationsare not to exceed $10,000 per violation, with the maximum amount assessednot to exceed $25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are not to exceed$10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, withthe maximum amount not to exceed $125,000.EPA is revising andSection; 122.41(a) (2) and (3) to reflect these changes.Section 122.41 sets out standard conditions that must be included in allpermits. This language merely puts permittees on notice as to the applicableenforcement provisions of the CWA.Section 312(c)(4) of the WQA increases the maximum penalty for knowinglymaking any false statements from six months to two years. The existingfine of not more than $10,000 for first time false statements remains unchanged,but maximum penalties are doubled for second offenses. EPA is revisingthe language set out in andSection; 122.41(j)(5) to reflect the requirementsof the WQA.F. Anti-BackslidingEPA regulations in andSection; 122.44(l) have generally prohibited the issuanceof a permit with limitations less stringent than those in the previouspermit, except in certain circumstances. The primary application of theserules has been to prohibit backsliding from permits written on a case-by-casebasis under CWA section 402(a)(1) using best professional judgment (BPJ)to less stringent subsequently promulgated effluent limitations guidelines(see andSection; 122.44(l)(2)).In section 404 of the WQA, Congress added section 402(o) to the CWA toclarify the Congressional intent that backsliding from BPJ limits to suchsubsequent guidelines was prohibited. Congress also listed several exceptionsto the prohibition. In general, these exceptions tracked the existing NPDESanti-backsliding rules applicable to BPJ permits. However, some of theexceptions have been changed or limited by the amendment and today's rulemakingis revising andSection;andSection; 122.44(l)(2) and 122.62(a) to reflect thesedifferences. Specifically, andSection; 122.62(a)(15) which allowed a BPJpermit to be modified due to excessive costs is not authorized by the statuteand is being deleted. The other exceptions in andSection; 122.44(l)(2) arebeing conformed to the amendment. In addition, EPA is adding the limitationfrom CWA section 402(o)(3) prohibiting the issuance of a permit less stringentthan existing effluent guidelines or applicable State water quality standards.The WQA also adds a prohibition against backsliding from water quality-basedpermits except in limited circumstances. Today's revision does not implementthis prohibition. EPA plans to propose rules to implement the prohibitionagainst backsliding from water quality-based permit limits in the nearfuture. EPA's regulation at andSection; 122.44(l)(1) restricts backslidingin cases not covered by the WQA amendments. EPA is not planning any rulemakingto revise this broader prohibition.G. Inspection and EntryIn Section 310 of the WQA (amending andSection; 308 of the CWA) Congressconfirms EPA's practice of allowing contractors to represent the Administratorfor purposes of entering and inspecting permitted facilities. The rulepromulgated today revises EPA's existing standard permit conditions onentry and inspection under Section 308 (andSection; 122.41(i) of the regulations)to insert the statutory language from Section 310.H. Sewage SludgePreviously, the CWA regulated sludge through the NPDES program only whenthe sludge was discharged into surface water from a point source. In thecase of publicly owned treatment works, the CWA prohibited disposal ofsludge except in accordance with national criteria controlling disposal.Section 406 of the WQA amends section 405 of the CWA to expand the applicabilityof the sewage sludge criteria promulgated under this section to includesludge from any treatment works that treats domestic sewage, whether publiclyor privately owned. Further, the amendments direct that any NPDES permitsissued must include the sewage sludge criteria. Today's rulemaking revisesexisting andSection; 122.44(o) by inserting a phrase to specify all treatmentworks treating domestic sewage are subject to national regulations controllingits disposal. Two future rulemakings will establish EPA's sludge managementprogram. One rulemaking will propose technical standards for the use anddisposal of sewage sludge; the other will establish sludge permitting requirementsand requirements for approving state sludge management programs. A proposalfor this second rulemaking appeared at 53 FR 7642 (March 9, 1988).I. Partial NPDES ProgramsSection 403 of the WQA amends CWA section 402 to allow States to seek partialNPDES approval in certain circumstances. Partial approval is approval ofa program which does not include NPDES, pretreatment and federal facilitiesauthority over all facilities in the State subject to these programs. Theamendment provides for two types of partial program approval. The firstis intended for circumstances where jurisdiction over all direct and indirectwastewater discharges in the State is split between two or more State agencies.The amendment requires the program to cover at a minimum administrationof a major category of discharges into the navigable waters of the State.The partial program must also represent a significant and identifiablepart of the State program required by CWA andSection; 402(b), and encompassall discharges under the jurisdiction of the State agency or agencies.The second type of partial program authorized is the ``partial and phased''program. This requires initial approval of a major component of a Stateprogram (which also must represent a significant and identifiable partof the State program), with the State assuming the remaining program elementsin phases. A State choosing this latter approach must submit a plan forassumption of the full program by a specified date not more than 5 yearsafter submission of the partial program. To distinguish between the twotypes of partial programs authorized by the WQA, EPA will refer to thefirst as ``partial'' and the latter as ``phased'' in this and subsequentrules.The existing regulation at andSection; 123.1(g) expressly prohibits EPA fromapproving partial programs. As a first step towards implementing the amendment,today's rule deletes the existing regulatory provision prohibiting partialprograms in andSection; 123.1(g) and revises that provision to clarify thatEPA will not accept partial or phased program submissions.EPA will propose additional rules that will explain how a State can applyfor and receive partial or phased program authority in a future rulemaking.J. 304(l) Toxic Control StrategiesSection 308 of the WQA amends CWA section 304 by creating a new section304(l). This provision requires States to develop lists of impaired waters,identify point sources and amounts of pollutants they discharge that causeviolations of water quality standards and develop and implement individualcontrol strategies for each such point source. The Agency is preparinga companion rulemaking that will address more completely the requirementsof andSection; 304(l).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Identification of Polluted Waters</ITAG>Paragraph (A) of Section 304(l)(1) requires States to submit to EPA twolists of waters. These lists include those waters within the State which,after application of BAT or BCT, cannot reasonably be anticipated to attainor maintain (i) State water quality standards adopted under section 303(c)(2)(B),due to toxic pollutants; or, (ii) the water quality goals of the CWA.The list prepared under paragraph (A)(ii) includes all waters affectedby toxic, conventional, and non-conventional pollutants from point andnon-point sources. It includes all waters whose designated uses are lessthan the fishable/swimmable goals of the CWA as well as those that arenot meeting water quality standards for established, designated uses. Thelist prepared under paragraph (A)(i) is a subset of the list required byparagraph (A)(ii) and identifies only segments where promulgated Statewater quality standards are not being met due to toxic pollutants. Thesetwo lists must be submitted to EPA not later than February 4, 1989.Paragraph (B) of section 304(l)(1) requires each State to submit a listof waters for which the State does not expect the ``applicable standard''under section 303 of the CWA to be achieved after the requirements of technology-basedtreatment standards are met due entirely or substantially to the pointsource discharge of any toxic pollutants listed under section 307(a) ofthe CWA. This list is also a subset of the (A)(ii) list.Paragraph (C) of section 304(l)(1) requires States to determine, for eachwater body on the paragraph (B) list, the specific point source dischargesof toxic pollutants believed to be preventing or impairing water quality.The States must also identify the amount of each pollutant discharged byeach point source identified in paragraph (C). Like the three lists developedunder paragraphs (A) and (B), the point sources identified under paragraph(C) must be submitted to EPA no later than February 4, 1989.Paragraph (D) of section 304(l)(1) requires States to submit individualcontrol strategies for each segment identified on the list required byparagraph (B) to EPA by February 4, 1989. The amendment requires that thesecontrol strategies contain effluent limitations which will result in achievementof the applicable water quality standard as soon as possible, but in noevent later than 3 years after establishment of the strategy (June 4, 1992at the latest). At section 304(l)(2), the amendment requires the Administratorto approve or disapprove control strategies submitted by States by no laterthan June 4, 1989.Today's rulemaking codifies the requirements contained in section 304(l)(1)(A), (B) and (C) at andSection; 130.10 of the regulations. Section 304(l)(1)(D) and (2) is codified by today's rulemaking in a new section of theregulations at andSection; 123.46.In order to meet the deadline in paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of section304(l)(1), a draft final EPA guidance document, ``Implementation of Requirementsunder Section 304(l) of the Clean Water Act As Amended'' (Sept. 1987) allowsStates to use existing and readily available data to develop the requiredlists of waters. At the same time, States should continue to gather newdata under existing programs where important information gaps exist. Thetoxics control program will continue to address emerging problems and ensureprevention of water quality impairment due to toxicity even after section304(l) deadlines have been met.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. EPA Review of Individual Control Strategies</ITAG>Section 304(l)(3) addresses EPA review of State individual control strategiesand is codified at andSection; 123.46(b). Section 304(l)(3) requires EPAto implement the requirements of section 304(l)(1) where a State failsto submit a control strategy or where EPA does not approve a control strategysubmitted by the State. The statute requires EPA to perform these taskswithin one year and 120 days after the date States are required to submitindividual control strategies to EPA. Thus, where EPA action is requiredunder this provision, the Agency must carry out these tasks by June 4,1990.Where EPA implements the requirements of section 304(l)(1), EPA must alsoconsider listing those waters for which any person submits a petition forlisting. Today's rule adds a new provision at andSection; 123.46 to implementthis requirement.K. New Source_Preconstruction BanEPA's existing regulation at andSection; 122.29(c) (4) and (5) addressesrequirements for new sources and new dischargers. Section (c)(4)(i) prohibitson-site construction of a new source for which an Environmental ImpactStatement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is requiredprior to final Agency action in issuing an NPDES permit. Section (c)(5)provides that violation of the on-site construction ban is grounds forpermit denial.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitrecently ruled on the validity of the on-site construction ban for newsources in <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Environmental Protection Agency,</T3>822 F. 2d 104 (D.C. Cir., 1987). The court held that the constructionban exceeded the agency's authority under either the Clean Water Act orNEPA, and that EPA therefore lacks authority to ban construction of newsources pending permit issuance. Accordingly, the court granted the petitionfor review of this issue.In response to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit,EPA is removing andSection; 122.29(c) (4) and (5) from the existing NPDESregulations. EPA will address these issues in subsequent rulemaking.L. CorrectionsToday's rulemaking also corrects inadvertent omissions, erroneous internalcross-references, and typographical errors in the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291: Regulatory Impact AnalysisExecutive Order 12291 requires each Federal agency to determine if a regulationis a ``major'' rule as defined by the Order and ``to the extent permittedby law,'' to prepare and consider a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) inconnection with every major rule. The regulation promulgated today is nota major rule, and therefore is not subject to the Regulatory Impact Analysis(RIA) requirement. This rule does not make changes in the existing law,but merely inserts the WQA provisions into the rules. This package doesnot incur more than $100 million in costs and fails to qualify as a ``major''rule under that standard.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.) requires each Federal agency to prepare a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis (RFA) when it promulgates a final rule. (5 U.S.C.604). The purpose of the RFA is to describe the effects the regulationswill have on small entities and examine alternatives that may reduce theseeffects. EPA has determined the Agency does not have to prepare a RFA todetermine the impact of today's regulation on State NPDES programs andthe waste-discharging industries because today's rule is merely a technicalamendment implementing those provisions in the 1987 WQA that do not requireadditional interpretation or comments. EPA has concluded that these amendmentswill not cause a significant impact on small entities.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Paperwork Reduction Act is intended to minimize the reporting burdenon the regulated community as well as minimize the cost of Federal informationcollection and dissemination. There are no information collection requirementstriggered by this rule except for the listing requirements for State watersrequired by CWA section 304(l)(1) and implemented in today's rulemakingat 40 CFR 123.46. The public will have the opportunity to comment on thisinformation collection requirement in a companion rulemaking more fullyimplementing the requirements of section 304(l).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 122Administrative practice and procedure; Air pollution control; Hazardousmaterials; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements; Waste treatment anddisposal; Water pollution control; Water supply; Confidential businessinformation. 40 CFR Part 123Hazardous materials; Indians-lands; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements;Waste treatment and disposal; Water pollution control; Water supply; Intergovernmentalrelations; Penalties; Confidential business information.40 CFR Part 124Hazardous materials; Waste treatment and disposal; Water pollution control;Water supply; Indians-lands.40 CFR Part 125Water pollution control; Water treatment and disposal.40 CFR Part 130Water quality standards.40 CFR Part 403Confidential business information; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements;Waste treatment and disposal; Water pollution control.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
