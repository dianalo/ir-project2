Method:Sulfuric acid, etc. are added to radioactive liquid wastes to adjustthe pH value of the liquid wastes to less than 3.0. Then, ferrous sulfatesare added such that the iron concentration in the liquid wastes is 100mg/l. Then, after adjusting pH suitably to the drying powderization byadding alkali such as hydroxide, the liquid wastes are dried and powderized.The resultant powder is subjected to plastic solidification by usingpolymerizable liquid unsaturated polyester resins as the solidifyingagent. The thus obtained solidification products are stable in view ofthe physical property such as strength or water proofness, as well asstable operation is possible even for those radioactive liquid wastesin which the content ingredients are unknown.
