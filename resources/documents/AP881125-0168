Conference Opens to Adopt Pact on Illegal Drugs</HEAD><BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. conference opened Friday to adoptan international convention against illicit drug trafficking anddrug abuse.   ``The convention will provide a new powerful weapon to combatdrug abuse and illicit trafficking,'' Axel Wuestenhage, deputydirector of the U.N. Information Office in Vienna, told TheAssociated Press.   ``What's very important is that they (the new rules) includerights to forfeit assets of illicit drug traffickers and rights ofextradition given to all signatory countries for the first time,''he said.   The conference is scheduled to last until Dec. 20. The conventionto be adopted complements two existing international legalinstruments _ the Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 signed by 121countries and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, towhich 88 countries have so far acceded.   The new convention is meant to meet the challenge posed by anupsurge in illicit drug trafficking and associated organizedcriminal activity. Both are viewed as undermining legitimateeconomies and threatening the stability, security and sovereignty ofU.N. member states.   The innovations will reportedly deal with such issues asforfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds and assets derived fromillicit trafficking, extradition, mutual legal assistance andcooperation and training of law enforcement officials.   Special chapters will provide for measures for internationalcooperation and help for drug-transit states, monitoring ofsubstances frequently used in illicit manufacture of drugs,eradicaton of illegal plant cultivation and suppression of outlawedtraffic by sea, in free-trade zones and free ports, conferenceofficials said.   Francesco Ramos Galino, director of the United Nation Division ofNarcotics Drugs, said some countries that previously refused todivulge information on secret bank accounts now are willing to do so.   Wuestenhage said the measures have been under discussion since1984, He said once the convention is adopted, it would be open forsignature by U.N. member states.   To become legally binding, the convention will have to beratified by parliaments or other national bodies in signatorycountries.   Delegates from about 100 countrties have sent representatives.Bolivia's Foreign Minister Guillermo Gutierrez is president of theconference.</TEXT></DOC>
