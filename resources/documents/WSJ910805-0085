The idea of forcing smokers and tobaccocompanies to pay for their own vilification has attractedattention nationwide, with legislators in other statesconsidering similar measures as a means to cut the number ofsmokers. But the impression that California's 16-month-old adcampaign has reduced smoking is based on data that shownothing of the kind.   Whatever officials say when pressed on the issue, it'sclear that California's anti-smoking campaign has been soldas something that it isn't. Its reputation says less aboutpublic-health policy than it does about the mythologysurrounding advertising.</LP><TEXT>   The state Department of Health Services reports that thepercentage of adult Californians who smoke declined from26.3% in 1987 to 21.2% in 1990. The decline in the number ofsmokers is some 13% bigger than would have been expectedbased on the downward trend prior to 1988. State officialshave suggested that the difference is due to the anti-smokingcampaign. But cigarette sales figures from the state Board ofEqualization tell a different story.   Between April 1990, when the ad campaign began, and theend of the year, Californians bought only about 1% fewerpacks of cigarettes than during the same period in 1989. In1990 as a whole, they actually bought about 1% morecigarettes than in 1989.   The sales data do show a significant drop in purchases, ofabout 14%, between 1988 and 1989. (By contrast, purchasesdeclined by about 1% between 1987 and 1988.) What happened in1989? That was the year the cigarette tax went to 35 centsfrom 10 cents, raising the price of each pack by about 12%.Michael Johnson, chief of the evaluation unit in the healthdepartment's Tobacco Control Section, agrees that &quot;it'sprimarily the tax that would account for the drop.&quot;   It looks like California has rediscovered the demandcurve. Other things being equal, the demand for a productwill decline when its price rises. But there's nothinginnovative about this approach to reducing tobaccoconsumption. It has long been one of the main rationales forcigarette taxes.   Why do so many people seem to believe that California hasdiscovered a new way to reduce smoking? Mr. Johnsonacknowledges that the news media and politicians in otherstates may have misconstrued the health department's reportof a decline in the number of smokers. &quot;People haveinterpreted that different ways,&quot; he says.   Mr. Johnson says he doesn't think the department'sstatements have been misleading. But consider the headlinefrom an October 1990 press release: &quot;Research Data Showssic Significant Drop in Tobacco Usage Since Enactment ofCalifornia's Tobacco Education Campaign.&quot; This is technicallyaccurate, if &quot;enactment&quot; means passage of Proposition 99,which occurred in 1988. But the &quot;education campaign&quot; didn'tstart until April 1990. Moreover, the press release focuseson the anti-smoking ads, ignoring the impact of raising thecigarette tax.   So it's not surprising that press coverage has emphasizedthe ad campaign. A story in the January 1991 issue of StateLegislatures, for example, mentions the tax increase, butalmost as an afterthought: &quot;{The} data show that 750,000 morepeople stopped smoking than would have been expected to do sowithout the anti-smoking campaign and the higher cigarettetaxes. Since the campaign began, the percentage ofCalifornians who smoke has dropped from 25% to 21%.&quot; In fact,the decline cited by the health department occurred between1987 and 1990, not &quot;since the campaign began.&quot;   Mr. Johnson says the health department has never made suchclaims. &quot;The media campaign is not designed to changebehavior,&quot; he explains. &quot;It's designed to create awareness.&quot;Presumably, though, this heightened awareness is supposed toencourage people to stop smoking. Otherwise the program is nomore than a subsidy for advertising firms, broadcasters andbillboard owners. It has already consumed some $28.6 million,and this summer the state legislature approved an additional$16 million.   ---   Mr. Sullum is assistant editor of Reason magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
