Officials of Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, which has operatedthe Feed Materials Production Center for the U.S. Department ofEnergy since 1985, said efforts to address the problem have alreadybegun.   Plant memorandums from 1965 through 1968 indicate that up to fivegallons a minute of uranium-bearing water mixed with nitric acid atethrough brick flooring and drain systems of Fernald's Plants 2 and 3and the Pilot Plant, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.   The underground pools discovered beneath the three plants add tothe problems of a production center already plagued by a25,000-gallon radioactive pool under Plant 6 and six toxic andradioactive waste storage pits.   The memos describing the leakage were discovered among thousandsgiven by the Energy Department to attorneys involved in a $300million class-action lawsuit neighbors filed against Fernald.   Graham Mitchell, Fernald team manager for the Ohio EnvironmentalProtection Agency, said the information was not surprising.   ``We've had general knowledge that the refinery (Plants 2 and 3)dealt with many more liquids than Plant 6 did,'' he said. ``Plant 6was kind of a surprise, because it didn't deal with many chemicals,so we had the feeling it wasn't the only one.''   The danger of the underground pools is that the radioactivitycould seep into drinking water supplies, Mitchell said. But JamesReafsnyder, the Energy Department's site manager at Fernald, saidclay under the plant seems to have confined the contamination.   He said there is a plan to drill wells to assess theenvironmental risk.   Fernald, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, processes uranium forthe federal government's nuclear weapons program.   Energy Department officials have refused to close the 1,050-acre,37-year-old plant, saying its operations do not endanger residentsor the environment. But the department has begun a 10-year, $500million cleanup and modernization effort.   The plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear materialsfor the Department of Energy. Several other plants are in variousstates of shutdown while health and safety problems are investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
