Searle andamp; Co., a unit of Monsanto Co., said it entered into an agreement with Invitron Corp. for the development of a new drug that may be used to treat a wide range of infectious diseases.    The pharmaceuticals concern said it has made an initial financial commitment to Invitron for exclusive rights to the product, with subsequent payments depending on development benchmarks and sales goals being achieved. Searle declined to disclose the amount of its commitment.    Invitron has been collaborating with researchers in the initial development of the substance, azurophil-derived bactericidal factor, or ADBF, since it was discovered just over two years ago.    Searle said that Invitron will continue to work on developing ADBF and that Searle will perform the clinical trials and market the product.    ADBF is an anti-microbial protein found in human white blood cells. White blood cells combat certain bacteria, yeast and other infectious microorganisms. Searle said since ADBF is one of the body's naturally produced antibiotics, it may be less toxic or allergenic than many traditional synthetic antibiotics.    Invitron is a St. Louis-based maker of biopharmaceuticals derived from cell culture. The company filed this week for an initial public offering of three million common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
