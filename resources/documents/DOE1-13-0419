Thesealgorithms allow uniform access for any power-of-two stride, and canbe used to reduce conflict for other stride accesses. They are basedon transformations that are linear over the Boolean field GF(2). Thismethod is applicable to primary and/or secondary memory systems of SIMDor MIMD machines, and can eliminate memory hot-spot problems associatedwith stride access. The solutions presented in this paper can easilybe implemented in hardware, and they present a method for incorporatingsuch transformations into logical-to-physical address translation.</TEXT></DOC>
