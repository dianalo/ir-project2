Robert Wallach never sought favorsfor the Wedtech Corp.   Meese took the stand at Wallach's racketeering trial in federalcourt Monday.   Meese, who resigned as attorney general in July 1988, was faultedin an internal Justice Department report released in January for hisefforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated, Mideast oil pipelineproposal and to assist him with Wedtech.   The department's Office of Professional Responsibility foundMeese had violated internal departmental standards of conduct and anexecutive order on ethics.   Meese has never been charged with any crimes in connection withthe Wedtech case.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss's cross-examination of Meesewas put off until Thursday after Weiss complained to U.S. DistrictJudge Richard Owen that he didn't know about Meese's appearanceuntil 10:30 p.m. Sunday and needed more.   During his hour-long testimony, Meese appeared relaxed.   ``Did Mr. Wallach ask you to intervene in any way, shape or formin the Wedtech investigation?'' asked Wallach's attorney, GaryNeftalis.   ``No, absolutely not,'' Meese said.   ``Did you intervene in any way in the Wedtech investigation?''Neftalis asked.   ``No, I did not in any way,'' he replied.   Wedtech, now defunct, was a small South Bronx machine shop thatgrew into a $100 million defense contractor through a Small BusinessAdministration program that set aside contracts without competitivebidding for minority-controlled companies.   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued toreceive the no-bid contracts through bribes even after it ceased tobe minority-owned.   Wallach; W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech board member andonetime Meese financial adviser; and a business associate of theirs,R. Kent London, are charged in a 21-count racketeering indictmentwith extracting almost $2 million in illegal payoffs and paymentsfrom Wedtech, including some $525,000 in alleged bribes to Wallachto influence Meese and other government officials.   Meese said Wallach, 55, told him in 1981 _ when Meese was ahigh-ranking adviser to President Reagan _ that Wedtech would be agood company for the administration to spotlight in its proposalsfor urban enterprise zones.   Wallach also told him about the company's efforts in 1981 tosecure an Army contract to build small engines, Meese said. Wallachsaid company officials felt they were not being treated fairly bythe Army.   Meese said he passed on the problem of the Army contract to hisstaff, who referred the matter to the Office of Cabinet Affairs atthe White House. He said he had received ``probably dozens'' ofsimilar complaints during his time at the White House. He said hedid nothing further.</TEXT></DOC>
