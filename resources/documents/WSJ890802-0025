Technically motivated dollar sales accelerated the U.S. currency's decline in afternoon trading in New York, when the dollar sank below an important support level against the mark, foreign exchange traders reported.    The July U.S. purchasing managers' report on manufacturing reflected the third straight decline in activity and helped confirm that the economy is slowing, meaning that the Fed may ease credit further, traders said.    &quot;By and large, the interest-rate differential and the slowing economy continue to weigh on the dollar,&quot; said Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8510 marks, down from 1.8648 marks Monday, and at 135.90 yen, down from 136.95 yen. The pound was at $1.6650, little changed from $1.6651.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 135.58 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 136.65 yen.    The purchasing managers' index declined to 46.0% in July from 48.8% in June, hitting its lowest level since January 1983. A reading below 50 indicates that the manufacturing segment of the economy is generally declining; above 50 indicates that it is generally expanding.    The dollar was confined to fairly narrow ranges in Asian and early European trading as market participants concentrated on mark-yen trading. The German currency traded in a range between 73.30 yen and 73.65 yen through most of New York trading. At the New York finish, the mark was unchanged at 73.46 yen.    The mark's intraday highs against the yen added to the dollar's troubles as the U.S. currency fell to a critical level at 1.8550 marks. The dollar's penetration of the support level prompted a wave of stop-loss dollar sales that sent the dollar to 1.85 marks.    Traders also noted that the mark posted gains against the pound as the perception grows that the Bank of England is uncomfortable about sterling trading above 3.10 marks. Above that level, the pound could undermine tenuous progress in the U.K.'s trade adjustment process, they said.    The pound finished New York trading at 3.0807 marks, down from 3.1062 marks Monday. The pound surged about two weeks ago when British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson predicted that inflation had reached its peak and pledged to hold interest rates high.    Ms. Babcock noted that other high-yield currencies have reaped benefits from the lackluster dollar performance. The Australian dollar, for instance, has rebounded from a tumble it took in mid-July, when a British brokerage firm predicted a sharp depreciation in the currency.    On July 19, the day after the report, the Australian dollar was fetching 74.45 U.S. cents in New York. The unit finished New York trading Tuesday at 76.57 U.S. cents.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $370.80 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was at $370.35 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
