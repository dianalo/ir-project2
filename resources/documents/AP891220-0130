That all-party peace pact signed on Dec. 21, 1979, silenced theguns and led to the birth of black-governed Zimbabwe four monthslater.   A decade later, as president of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is on thereceiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebelsbased in Mozambique.   While Mugabe was able to lead Rhodesia to peace as Zimbabwethrough talks, he is opposed to similar direct negotiations withthe insurgents, who have threatened to bring their war intoZimbabwe.   Alfonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance seeks toundermine Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano's socialistgovernment.   The 12-year-old war has left an estimated 500,000 to 700,000dead and created about 1 million Mozambican refugees. Almost halfof Mozambique's 15 million people require some food aid.   The guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital tolandlocked Zimbabwe's economy, and Mugabe has stationed 12,000troops in Mozambique at a crippling cost of $450,000 a day.   Dhlakama's rebels now routinely cross the scrub-studded plainsand pine-carpeted mountains into Zimbabwe to raid tea and coffeeplantations, native villages and state schools.   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in theseforays, and tens of thousands have been herded into state-guardedvillages, upsetting life all along the 800-mile frontier.   ``The Rhodesians forced many people into so-called protectedvillages when they were fighting Mugabe's guerrillas,'' said aRoman Catholic missionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity.``So there are villagers today who are suspicious that they'rebeing placed in similar settlements by the government theysupport.''   But missionaries back the government's contention thatZimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because ofthe rebels.   The guerrillas, known also by their Portuguese acronym Renamo,have been accused of widespread atrocities, including the killingof children, mutilating of victims, rape, and destruction of entirecommunities.   The rebels were founded in 1977 by former Rhodesian PrimeMinister Ian D. Smith to hound Mugabe's guerrillas in theirMozambican bases.   Mugabe ended aid for Renamo when he came to power and nogovernment currently acknowledges assistance.   Mugabe and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi have been acting asintermediaries in indirect talks in Kenya between the rebels andthe Mozambique government. There have been no breakthroughs sincethe talks began in July.   Mugabe has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks forMozambique, insisting Renamo disavow violence and lay down its armsfirst.   Renamo, in turn, demands Zimbabwe withdraw its troops fromMozambique before face-to-face negotiations can be considered.   Renamo also demands that Mozambique's government allow it totake part in elections as a legal party.   The Mozambican government says it will not accept a second partybut is considering a proposal that would allow people who are notin the ruling party to run for Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
