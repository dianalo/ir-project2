(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New Hampshire primary was a greattriumph for two disparate groups, the Republican establishment andlovers of political chaos.   George Bush, the quintessential establishment candidate, emergedfrom the ashes of Iowa to regain the mantle of Republicanfront-runner but his victory brightened the hopes of those whocherish rousing political brawls and hope for at least one thisyear that goes all the way to the convention floor.   Of course it is the Democrats, with their looser rules and lackof a clear leader, who really provide hope for an open convention.Michael Dukakis' triumph put him temporarily atop the Democraticfield, but none of the seven candidates has demonstrated nationalappeal.   And so it's ``On to the South.'' The candidates are all takingdead aim on the March 8 election day when most of the South andsome key states outside will select enough delegates to settle theraces in both parties.   But don't bet on a Super Tuesday resolution. The big stakes _1,307 Democratic delegates in 20 states and 700 Republican in 16states may only confuse the contests rather than settle them.   You have to like Bush's chances, but both parties offerscenarios that argue for long hard fights.   Two Democrats without obvious appeal in Dixie _ Rep. RichardGephardt of Missouri and Dukakis _ split the two early events andnow are confronted by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and JesseJackson on their own turf.   Jackson finished fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire, solidshowings in two states which have very few minority voters whoprovide his base of support. There is no reason to think that anyof the other Democrats can compete with Jackson for the large blackvote in the South.   As a Tennessean who has positioned himself to the right of therest of the Democratic field, Gore has run a Super Tuesday strategythat will test a generation-old political assumption _ that youcan't win the nomination without competing in the early events.   ``I think Super Tuesday changes all the rules,'' said Gore.``It's a completely new ball game.''   It's a dicey strategy, but even if it falls short Gore may getenough support on March 8 to establish his candidacy and perhapsleave Jackson as the biggest winner of delegates that day.   Then it would be on to the Midwest for four Democrats _ Jackson,Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore.   That prospect would delight Republicans. But they could be in amuddle of their own.   If the Southern contest were Bush versus Sen. Bob Dole, theoutcome would appear tilted in favor of the vice president, who hasa strong organization throughout the region, a strongidentification with President Reagan, and roots in the biggest plumof all, Texas.   But it won't be a two-man fight for the Republicans; Rep. JackKemp lives to fight on in the South and Pat Robertson will bebattling on his home turf.   Bush and Dole are battling for the same voters, while Robertsonhas a constituency all his own, many of them people activatedpolitically by a desire to support the former evangelist.   Republican rules make it almost impossible for the presidentialrace to go all the way to the convention in New Orleans nextAugust. Chances are better that two candidates _ or maybe eventhree _ will fight for the 175 delegates at stake in California'swinner-take-all Republican primary on June 7. But if there arethree Republicans battling for that delegation, the field may be sosplit that even a California win would not put someone over the top.   All in all, it's a volatile mix on both sides. On the morningafter New Hampshire, a good bet is that Super Tuesday will settlenothing _ certainly among the Democrats _ and the cry that nightwill be, ``On to California, by way of Illinois, New York...''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Donald M.
