Salwen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><IN>SECURITIES (SCR)SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT (RGU)</IN><GV>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- A tepid report on limited partnerships bythe Securities and Exchange Commission offers little fuel forlawmakers eager to overhaul the partnership industry.   The report, delivered eight months after it was requestedby Reps. Edward Markey and Mike Synar, said the SEC isconducting &quot;an extensive review&quot; of the issue, and that theagency is considering tightening disclosure rules forpartnerships.</LP><TEXT>   The findings gave legislators scant encouragement that theSEC plans to take the lead in revising how the industryworks. Indeed, the agency's report appeared to irritate Rep.Markey, the head of the House Telecommunications and FinanceSubcommittee, who called figures used by the SEC &quot;nebulous.&quot;   The Massachusetts Democrat is planning to unveil nextmonth legislation on limited partnership &quot;roll-ups,&quot; in whichpartnerships that were designed as long-term untradedinvestments are combined into publicly traded securities.&quot;Literally hundreds of thousands of small and oftenunsophisticated investors have found the deck stackedsystematically against them,&quot; Rep. Markey said. &quot;Congressmust take swift action to protect these small investors.&quot;   The subcommittee holds its second hearing on the subjecttoday. Rep. Markey's bill is likely to include items designedto &quot;protect&quot; partnership investors. For example, Rep. Markeyis considering a &quot;dissenter's rights&quot; plan that would allowpartners who didn't vote in favor of the roll-up to eitherretain their original deal or receive compensation.Currently, dissenters are swept along with the roll-up if theplan is approved.   Rep. Markey and others were hoping for the SEC to takemore initiative in its study of the 66 roll-ups since 1984involving about 1.2 million investors and $6.9 billion.Partnership investors often have found that &quot;healthy&quot;holdings have been combined with financially poor ones inroll-ups and that the value of their investment plummetedafter the new combined product went public.   In its 38-page report, the agency repeatedly refused tooffer much advice, saying it was still studying the issue andarguing that roll-ups can benefit some investors. In manyareas, the SEC explained that state law governs much ofpartnership structure and that the agency didn't have thepower to change that.   The agency did offer some encouragement for lawmakers,however, by suggesting that it is prepared to stiffen thedisclosure requirements for roll-up documents. That effort islikely to try to ensure that investors are able to easilydetermine general partner fees, the reason for the roll-up,and information that the partnership is likely to trade belowthe exchange value after the roll-up.</TEXT></DOC>
