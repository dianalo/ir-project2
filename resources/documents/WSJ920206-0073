They arebest thought of as long-distance versions of that familiaroffice device, the photocopier.   Like copiers, fax machines accept original documents onpaper, scan the documents with electronic sensors and thenspit out copies, or facsimiles. The difference, of course, isthat the copy is sent to a distant fax machine, via specialtelephone circuitry built into both faxes.   But as fax machines have become ubiquitous, makers haveoffered so many features, in so many combinations, thatshopping for a machine can be trying. Prices range from $300or so to thousands of dollars. Ads are littered with termssuch as &quot;Group 3,&quot; &quot;broadcast&quot; and &quot;fine mode.&quot;   The basic rule is this: Buy only the features you need.The simplest little fax machine may be enough for home use orlow-volume professions. So analyze your likely needs and shunsuperfluous bells and whistles.   To help, here's a guide to some important features of faxmachines. Next week's column will explore alternatives tostand-alone fax machines, which allow personal computers andprinters you may already own to double as faxing devices.   First, let's clear away the underbrush. Fax ads are ladenwith certain buzzwords that you can ignore, because theyapply to nearly every machine at every price. One is &quot;Group3&quot; compatibility. This simply means the machine can send andreceive according to the currently prevalent internationalstandard. Another is the ability to handle both &quot;normal&quot; and&quot;fine&quot; output; this comes with Group 3 compatibility.   Then there is the claim that a machine can double as acopier. Nearly every fax machine can, by &quot;sending&quot; atransmission to itself. But most make poor copiers, becausethey yield only one copy at a time and use waxy fax paper.   The rest of the key features can be divided into threecategories: those that affect how you feed documents into themachines, those that affect how you receive faxes sent byothers and those that affect the telephone functions of themachine.   On the input end of the fax process, one feature isespecially important: document feeding. The most basicmachines require users to feed each page of a document byhand. That's fine for a college student faxing an occasionalletter or research paper home. But even for most smallbusinesses, it's essential to get a machine with an automaticfeeder that lets you stack up at least a few pages and walkaway.   On the receiving end, the biggest decision is whether amachine produces faxes on the familiar special fax paper oron regular paper. Most machines use rolls of the old-stylegreasy fax paper, and they cost less initially thanplain-paper faxes. But fax paper curls and turns dark andbrittle. It often must be photocopied if you want to keep itpermanently, adding time and cost.   Plain-paper faxes using the same printing mechanism ascopiers and laser printers are dropping rapidly in price.Some can be had for $1,700, with a strong array of otherfeatures bundled in. They also have lower per-page operatingcosts because they use standard office paper. But bear inmind that, like copiers and printers, plain-paper faxmachines require the periodic purchase of supplies thatold-fashioned fax machines don't need.   If you opt for standard fax paper and receive more than adozen faxed pages a day, you should get a machine with anautomatic paper cutter to separate faxes into cut pages.Otherwise, somebody has to manually snip the pages apart. Andbe sure to get a machine that can accept paper rolls longenough to meet your needs. Another useful feature is built-inmemory, to store a page electronically if your paper rollruns out and then print it when you insert a new roll.   When you use the same phone line for regular calls andfaxes, consider voice/fax switching. This feature enables themachine to recognize whether an incoming call is a voice orfax transmission. Otherwise, a human must answer the phoneand decide. But to use such switching, you must make the faxmachine's built-in phone your primary one for all incomingcalls.   Finally, fax machines offer an array of dialing options toautomate transmissions. Most offer some sort of speeddialing, where you can program in frequently called numbersand then dial them by pressing single buttons or enteringtwo-digit codes. Some will redial busy numbers automatically;others can be set to transmit at a specified time.   Pricier machines offer &quot;broadcasting&quot;: the ability totransmit a single outgoing fax to multiple recipients whosenumbers have been programmed into the machine (this is thehaven of &quot;junk&quot; faxers). Others can do &quot;polling,&quot; or call agroup of fax machines to see whether they have material readyto send.   As with telephones, VCRs and other high-tech gizmos, theseprogrammable features may look nice on paper but can bedifficult to operate using the fax machines' limited keypadsand screens. So, if you choose a complex machine, be sure totry before you buy.</TEXT></DOC>
