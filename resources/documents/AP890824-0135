(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists searching thebottom of Crater Lake said Thursday that they have found evidence ofhot springs, a finding that could influence commercial energydevelopment outside the park.   Oregon State University oceanographer Jack Dymond reportedmeasuring a temperature of 64 degrees Monday in a mat of bacterianear the bottom of the lake. That is about 26 degrees higher thanthe surrounding water.   ``We found the temperatures we've been looking for for threeyears,'' said Crater Lake National Park biologist Jim Milestone. Hesaid the lake bottom exploration now will concentrate on measuringthe flow of water from the point where the temperature was recorded.   Crater Lake, the nation's deepest _ 1,932 feet _ and clearestlake, was formed when the Mount Mazama volcano erupted about 6,800years ago and collapsed to form a gigantic bowl called a caldera.   The underlying rock is still warm from volcanic activity and thelake rarely ices over in winter.   California Energy Co. is drilling an exploratory hole less thanone mile from the southeast corner of the park boundary in theWinema National Forest in hopes of developing a geothermal powerplant, using underground hot water or steam to generate electricity.   The National Park Service fears the drilling could affectgeothermal activity under the lake or that drilling fluids couldmigrate through the rock to vents where hot water flows into thelake and affect its water quality. Officials also don't know if thedrilling could affect the way water leaves the lake, which is filledby rain and snowmelt and has no surface outlet.   The agency also doesn't want the noise and steam clouds thatwould be created by power generation so close to the park boundaries.   Dymond made the temperature readings in a one-man submersiblethat he has used to explore the lake this month. The reading wastaken near the spot where Dymond's colleague, Robert Collier,recorded a temperature of 61 degrees one day earlier during a divein the submersible.   Park Superintendent Robert Benton said it was uncertain how thisnew evidence would affect the park's fight against the geothermalenergy exploration.   ``That's a political decision,'' Benton said. ``I would betechnically a lot more confident when they put the whole packagetogether.''   Congress last year declared the park as containing significantgeothermal features. However, that status is up for review pendingthe results of the current three-year exploration of the lake bottom.   If the park's significant geothermal status holds up, thesecretary of the Interior Department would have the power to curtailfuture geothermal development outside the park if it could threatenfeatures in the lake.   In another development, Milestone said high levels of radon gashave been measured in mysterious blue pools discovered earlier thismonth on the lake bottom.   Milestone said that radon in excess of 700 decays per minute per100 liters was measured in samples from the blue pools. Thatcompares to radon levels on the lake surface of 1 decay per minuteper 100 liters.</TEXT></DOC>
