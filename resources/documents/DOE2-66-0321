They are readily absorbed from such vehiclesand this absorption is facilitated by the presence of bile salts in theintestinal lumen. Their absorption is, however, only partially dependenton bile. Despite their very low aqueous solubility, the final step intheir absorption probably involves aqueous monomeric solution close tothe apical microvillous membrane of the absorbing epthelial cell. Mixedlipid-bile salt micelles probably facilitate the absorption by creatinga high concentration of the compounds close to the enterocytes. It islikely that in vivo PAHs bind to various dietary constituents, particularlydietary fiber by a hydrophobic interaction. The influence of such bindingon the bioavailability of PAHs is unknown. The absorption of DMBA isof similar extent when the compound is presented as a solute in oliveoil (triolein) or safflower oil (trilinolein) but absorption from a medium-chaintriglyceride oil is considerably less than from a long-chain triglyceride.After absorption, PAHs such as DMBA are rapidly excreted chiefly in bileas polar metabolites. These metabolites, chiefly glucuronide conjugates,are extensively reabsorbed and re-excreted; thus, there is a considerableenterohepatic circulation of these substances. Dietary fiber has alsobeen shown to bind the polar biliary metabolites of DMBA but the extentof binding is considerably less than that of the parent compound.</TEXT></DOC>
