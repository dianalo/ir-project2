(Cast in Code)(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Coffee, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>As the international market becomes increasingly important to USsoftware publishers, they will have to begin developing programsthat can handle in foreign languages.andP;  Simply translating theterms that appear in the menus does not always suffice.andO;Ashton-Tate has developed a version of Framework that not onlyhandles Russian but also allows the user to switch between Englishand Russian at the touch of a key.andP;  A utility developed in theSoviet Union allows alternate characters to be defined for use insuch things as DOS file names.andP;  Ashton-Tate's will supply softwarefor the upper echelon of the Soviet government, a market which isexpected to expand to 28 million microcomputers in 2000.andP;  If othercompanies expect to find a place in the international market theywill also have to develop innovative products.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer industrySoftware PublishersPlanningForeign LanguagesInternational Trade.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>When PC products get faster, smaller and cheaper, the improvements are easyto measure and easy to describe.andP;  At shows like this month's Comdex, however,you have to dig a little deeper to find software that does somethinggenuinely different, instead of just doing old things somewhat better.andM;As we head for the 1990s, one new requirement is support for multilingualwork groups.andP;  This need is growing all over the world: We see it in theplanned unification of the European market in 1992, the reduced tensionsbetween the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, and the integration of PacificRim markets from Seoul to San Diego.andM;Most software isn't ready to meet these needs.andP;  For example, an engineer at alocal firm told me about some Europeans who came to inspect the jets thatthey were buying; one was an avid user of Microsoft Word on the Macintosh andhad recently been pleased to get a version whose dictionary supported hiseveryday business language.andM;When he pulled down his first menu, though, he was terribly confused.andP;  &quot;Itdidn't look like anything that I knew!&quot; Menu-based commands are so brief thatone needs a true command of the language to keep the proper meaning; imagineif &quot;Spelling Check&quot; were rendered as &quot;Verify Letters.&quot;andM;Despite the confusing menus, the European does use his new native-languageWord -- but he picks menu items by remembering their locations from longexperience with the English version.andP;  We'll have to do better than that.andP;  Andat Comdex, I saw something that starts us down the right path.andM;What I saw was a Russian version of Ashton-Tate's Framework integratedsoftware.andP;  It wasn't just a translation, but a bilingual version that canswitch between English and Russian modes with a hot key -- even to the pointof embedding Russian words, using Cyrillic characters, in the middle ofEnglish text.andM;The Russian version of Framework relies on a utility, Informantage II, whichwas developed in the Soviet Union.andP;  This is a powerful extension of MS-DOS,with potential applications in many other countries whose languages usenon-Roman alphabets.andM;Informantage II lets the user define alternate character sets using thegraphic character-generation features of CGA and other graphics displays.andP;  Itlets the user define hot keys and alternate keyboard layouts for those sets,and does on-the-fly substitution of alternate characters when they're used inthings like DOS file names (which need to look the same to any application).andM;In the next year or two, Ashton-Tate (working with the Leningrad Institute ofInformatics and Automation) will equip several thousand new users across thetop levels of the Soviet administration.andP;  This will give its product acommanding position in an expanding market, estimated at 28 million PC-classmachines by the year 2000 -- almost the size of the current worldwide base ofMS-DOS PCs.andM;For a company that has lately gotten very little respect, this is welcomenews.andP;  For the industry as a whole, it is a powerful symbol of the need foran international approach.andM;It will be no small task to bring personal computing to other countries (oreven to the increasingly non-English-speaking labor force in the UnitedStates, for that matter).andP;  Icons aren't the solution -- for example, the iconof the cracked wine glass (often used to indicate fragile packages) was onceinterpreted by workers at one airport as indicating damaged goods.andP;  Theytreated the boxes accordingly.andM;In general, communication is hard.andP;  At Comdex, for example, PC Week ProductAnalyst Dale Lewallen and I spent the whole three hours of the Spencer pajamaparty standing at the door of a jam-packed room, explaining the meaning ofthe phrase &quot;One person per invitation.&quot;andM;If the world's smartest convention-goers couldn't get that one little conceptstraight, imagine the problems to come in the international decade that liesonly one month away.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
