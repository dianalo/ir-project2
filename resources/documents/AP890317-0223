(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A court battle pitting Microsoft againstApple Computer could highlight pivotal questions about copyright,creativity and the future development of software for personalcomputers, industry analysts say.   ``The whole industry is going to breathe a sigh of relief whenthis case is decided, even if the decision is unpopular,'' saidKenneth Wasch, an attorney and executive director of the SoftwarePublishers Association in Washington, D.C.   Apple sued Microsoft a year ago, charging the Redmond companywith copyright infringement.   Apple claimed that Microsoft exceeded a contract granting it theright to use the ``look and feel'' of Apple's Macintosh computer incertain Microsoft ``Windows'' programs for IBM and compatiblecomputers.   ``Look and feel'' is industry jargon for how a program appears ona screen and is acted upon by the user.   Microsoft, the nation's largest software developer for personalcomputers, filed a countersuit saying that its contract permitsMicrosoft to bring the simplicity and graphical look of Apple'sMacintosh to the IBM and compatible personal computer world throughWindows. Microsoft asked for a summary judgment dismissing Apple'ssuit.   Apple also names Hewlett Packard in the suit. HP licensed Windowsfrom Microsoft to develop a program called New Wave.   Arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard Friday in U.S.District Court in San Francisco before Judge William Schwarzer. Ifquestions are raised about the contract, the second phase of thecase would be heard in August.   ``Right now Apple and Microsoft are speaking differentlanguages,'' said William Pope, senior corporate counsel forMicrosoft. ``We are looking at the same words and saying they meandifferent things. We need the judge to give us a common language.''   Apple had no comment on the litigation.   The Seattle Times reported Thursday that underlying the contractlanguage dispute are more fundamental copyright questions, theanswers to which could affect the future course of softwaredevelopment nationwide.   What kind of software can be copyrighted? Who owns an on-screen``look?'' What is an obvious programming technique and what isinfringement on somebody else's intellectual property? There are fewanswers yet.   ``These are pivotal issues in the industry,'' said RobertTherrien, a stock analyst with PaineWebber in New York. ``Right now,the legal status of who owns what is unclear.''   The nation's No. 2 and No. 3 personal computer software companiesbehind No. 1 Microsoft _ spreadsheet maker Lotus Development Corp.and database maker Ashton-Tate _ are also suing competitors accusingthem of copyright infringement. Those cases have yet to go to court.   Legal experts and the Software Publishers' Association seedangers to the software industry in this litigious atmosphere.   ``Nationwide there appears to be a trend that copyright andpatent protection is being used as a tool'' to protect market share,said Esther Schachter, publisher of the Computer Law andamp; Tax Report.   While that may bring short-term gains for companies, Schachtersaid, the long-term effect on the industry may be devastating.   ``We're talking about an industry in its infancy, which has agreat need for the maximum amount of freedom and creativity,''Schachter said. ``Stifling that creativity may put a damper on thedevelopment of the software industry.''   Introduced in 1984, Apple's ``Mac'' computer is famous for itsease of use, thanks to its copyrighted ``graphical user interface,''or on-screen set of pictorial commands.   ``What is happening now, is that the look and feel of theMacintosh is being emulated all over the (IBM) PC world,'' Waschsaid.   To most users and even software developers in the IBM world, thatis good news, Wasch said.   Microsoft helped fuel the popularity of the Mac with a leadingspreadsheet and word-processing software. Now, Microsoft clearlyintends to duplicate its success on the world's 25 millionIBM-styled machines.   The software that runs those PCs is called DOS, also fromMicrosoft. Windows now gives DOS a Mac-like graphical userinterface. Microsoft says it sells 60,000 copies of Windows eachmonth, as many Macs as Apple sells.   More recently, Microsoft and IBM have produced a newer version ofWindows called Presentation Manager, which is built into Microsoft'sand IBM Corp.'s new operating system, OS@2. Designed torun only on newer, more powerful PCs, OS@2 is the heir apparent toDOS.   The new version of Windows means that if Apple wins big,Microsoft and IBM could face a sudden and potentially disastrousroadblock to bringing the ease of a Mac to the IBM PC.</TEXT></DOC>
