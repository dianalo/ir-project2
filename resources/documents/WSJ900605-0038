With the takeover boom fizzling out, scores of high-pricedinvestment bankers are being shown the door at Wall Streetfirms, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman HuttonHoldings Inc., the First Boston Corp. unit of CS First BostonInc., and the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Salomon Inc.</LP><TEXT>   The deal slowdown also has produced pink slips at lawfirms with big merger practices, such as Willkie Farr andamp;Gallagher, Shearson's main outside law firm, and CahillGordon andamp; Reindell. Cahill Gordon represents Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., the securities firm that used to do 50% of allnew junk-bond issues, which financed many takeovers; Drexel'sparent filed for bankruptcy-law protection from creditors inFebruary.   Even lower-paid professionals at commercial banks arefeeling the slump. Some banks built huge groups with scoresof people to crank out loans for leveraged buyouts and otherdeals. Last month, Bank of Boston Corp. disbanded a 16-memberteam that specialized in buy-out loans.   Many Wall Street dealmakers rode the 1980s takeover boomto multimillion-dollar salaries. Now they are facing lowerpay or layoffs for the first time in years. The reason: toomany lawyers and investment bankers and not enough deals.   According to Securities Data Co., the volume of announcedtakeovers world-wide this year through May fell 45% from thesame period in 1988, and U.S. takeovers alone declined 61%.In recent months, the slump has extended beyond highlyleveraged deals to include so-called strategic acquisitions,hostile bids in which one corporation seeks to buy another inthe same industry.   Even now, if the deal business doesn't rebound quickly --something few professionals expect -- merger departments willhave to make even greater cutbacks. &quot;There's probably two orthree times more {deal-making} capacity than needed at themoment,&quot; says Martin Lipton, a well-known takeover defenselawyer at Wachtell Lipton Rosen andamp; Katz. His 105-lawyer firmis less vulnerable to a downturn, because it didn't expandwildly during the merger boom.   Mr. Lipton says a lot of the capacity was built up tohandle &quot;the type of transaction that's unlikely to reappear-- a highly leveraged transaction, followed by the sale ofpieces&quot; of the target company.   Typically, he says, a hostile bidder obtained bank loansand a temporary bridge loan from an investment bank,refinanced the bridge by selling high-yielding junk bonds,and auctioned half the target company's assets. Each of thoseauctions often required bank loans and junk bonds, as well.The whole sequence required a half-dozen investment banks,four lead commercial banks and a dozen law firms.   Though some takeover professionals see hope in thestill-healthy field of international takeovers, mainly inEurope, many of them believe the boom times won't returnsoon. &quot;The last four or five years were the aberrations, not1990,&quot; says Robert Friedman, co-administrative partner atSimpson Thacher andamp; Bartlett. That law firm, like most otherlarge firms, plans to scale back its hiring of new lawyersfrom the torrid pace of the late 1980s.   The bloodiest cuts this year have come at Shearson Lehman,where balance-sheet weakness required a financial overhaul byits parent, American Express Co., in February. In the pastyear, Shearson Lehman has cut 120 investment bankers,including 40 in municipal bonds, from a force that totaled876 a year ago.   Merrill Lynch, which had laid claim to junk-bondleadership since Drexel Burnham's demise, has reduced itsinvestment-banker population by 100, to 600, in the pastyear, according to a person close to the firm.   Jerome Kenney, Merrill Lynch's head of capital markets,says: &quot;The late 1980s had a soaring rise in the use ofleverage. That leverage has now gone too far,&quot; he says, andas a result, &quot;a lot of corporate America has to restructure.&quot;Though Merrill Lynch and other Wall Street firms are tryingto redeploy investment bankers to do corporaterestructurings, Mr. Kenney acknowledges that restructurings&quot;will not replace the profits of the '88 and '89 dealbusiness, because those fees were so big.&quot;   First Boston, which has hit snags on some bridge loans itmade to help clients complete takeovers, has just beguncutting people to respond to the merger slowdown. SinceJanuary 1989, a spokesman says, the firm has reduced itsinvestment banking professionals by 80, to 500. And Salomonhas trimmed its deal-maker population since February, cuttingits mergers head count to 90 from 100 and its investmentbanking ranks to 410 from 420.   Meanwhile, executives of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co., two of Wall Street's top deal-makers, say theyare trimming their legions only slightly. Goldman Sachs andMorgan Stanley ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, behindDrexel Burnham last year in junk-bond issues, with $78.3million and $75.6 million in junk fees. So far this year,Goldman Sachs has a $6.3 million fee for one issue, accordingto Securities Data. In all last year, Wall Street firmsreaped a total of $807.7 million in junk-bond fees; so farthis year, the total is only $11 million.   Speculation about cutbacks has swirled around Wasserstein,Perella andamp; Co., a two-year-old merger firm created by BruceWasserstein, an adviser who left First Boston with JosephPerella in 1988. The startup firm ranked third in 1989takeover-deal volume, and a spokesman says it is stillexpanding, particularly in Europe, growing from 110professionals in February to 120 in May.   The rapid Wasserstein Perella expansion has raisedquestions about how the firm will manage its overhead. Thisyear, the firm can still live off fees that continue to comein from big deals announced in 1989, such as the acquisitionof Warner Communications Inc. by Time Inc. and the hostiletakeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. by Georgia-PacificCorp. But it isn't clear how the firm will manage in 1991.   While many people leaving investment banks are relativelyjunior deal-makers, some more senior bankers are heading forthe hills voluntarily.   Two of Shearson Lehman's merchant bankers, David Offensendand Stephen Gruber, left this spring to become dealmakers atRosecliff Inc., which manages money and makes deals on behalfof the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several financialinstitutions. And late last week, a Salomon Brothersretailing dealmaker, Diane Price Baker, left to become chieffinancial officer at R.H. Macy andamp; Co.   While many investment bankers who entered the business inthe 1980s will be tempted to leave because this will be theirfirst year with less pay, they may find it difficult toreplicate their lavish compensation elsewhere.   Most law firms say they don't have to respond as radicallyto the changed climate, because their compensation wasn't asvolatile as that of investment bankers.   But some law firms have been noticeably hard-hit. WillkieFarr told 22 associates they had to leave by mid-1990, anunusually large number; one reason is the deal slowdown atShearson Lehman, one of Willkie's biggest clients. &quot;Thehostile-deal business is substantially dead,&quot; says a WillkieFarr partner, Jack Nusbaum.   But Mr. Nusbaum says that work keeps coming in from othercorporate clients, and that Willkie Farr's bankruptcy andrestructuring work is picking up. For example, Willkie Farris the debtor's counsel for Integrated Resources Inc., aformer Drexel Burnham client, which has filed forbankruptcy-law protection from creditors.   Cahill Gordon, Drexel Burnham's main law firm, fired about25 associates in February, around the same time DrexelBurnham collapsed and its parent sought bankruptcy-lawprotection. Roger Meltzer, co-administrative partner, saidthe firings weren't connected to Drexel Burnham's demise orthe deal slowdown, because the firm has an &quot;active anddiversified practice.&quot;   But Mr. Meltzer acknowledges that Cahill Gordon is&quot;proceeding business-as-usual in a different world. Thatworld is a lower level of mergers and acquisitions activityon Wall Street, and a lower level of securities transactionsas a whole. People are trying to reorient themselves, tryingto figure out what the 1990s hold for the law business inrelation to the investment banking business.&quot;   While other law firms that are heavily dependent on dealwork may have avoided mass layoffs, many expect sharply lowerprofits and reduced hiring of new lawyers.   Much of the speculation about how the merger slowdown willaffect law firms has focused on Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp;Flom, which became a 1,050-lawyer firm from the base of thelegal world's busiest mergers practice, led by partner JosephFlom.   Executive partner Peter Mullen says Skadden Arps hasdiversified, so that only 20% of its lawyers work on mergers.Also, some merger lawyers have shifted into restructuringwork, an area that has grown to 75 lawyers from 25 in thepast year.   Mr. Mullen says Skadden Arps has worked on about the samenumber of deals as it did last year, but they are smaller,and fewer get completed. And he acknowledges that SkaddenArps's profit per partner is likely to decline in 1990 forthe first time in three or four years.   Most big banks declined to comment on their leveraged-loanstaffing. A spokesman for Citicorp says the bank has cut thenumber of bankers making senior-debt loans for takeover dealsby 25% since 1987. But the overall head count has remainedthe same, the spokesman says, citing growth in venturecapital, international, and junk-bond activity.   ---   William Power contributed to this article.   ---                 Hard Times for Dealmakers                                                                                                          SECURITIES FIRMS                                                                                                          Merrill Lynch   -- Cut 100 investment bankers in past year*                                                                                                          First Boston   -- Cut 80 investment bankers since Jan. 1989*                                                                                                          Shearson Lehman Hutton   -- Cut 80 investment bankers in 1990*                                                                                                          Salomon Brothers   -- Cut 20 investment bankers since Feb.*                                                                                                          LAW FIRMS                                                                                                          Willkie Farr andamp; Gallagher   -- Shearson's law firm; told 22 associates to leave        by mid-1990                                                                                                          Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel   -- Drexel's law firm; fired about 25 associates in Feb.
