The account bills about $120 million annually.    IBM declined to comment, but executives in the industry said the six agencies approached by IBM about competing for its account are: DDB Needham Worldwide Inc., New York, an Omnicom Group unit; D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles, New York; Jordan McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor, New York; Lintas: Worldwide , a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.; Geer, DuBois Inc., New York; and Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFS Compton, a Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFS Inc. unit.    Officials at all the agencies except Lintas and Saatchi declined to comment. William Weithas, chairman and chief executive at Lintas, said he is &quot;optimistic&quot; about Lintas's chances with IBM but declined to confirm discussions had begun. Saatchi officials couldn't be reached.    IBM has previously said the competition also includes both Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein, which currently handles the bulk of its advertising, and Lord Einstein O'Neill andamp; Partners, which handles a few IBM projects.    Although IBM asked Lord Einstein to join the competition, it isn't clear the agency will be allowed to compete. Lord Einstein -- started in March by six top Lord Geller executives who defected -- is involved in a bitter lawsuit with Lord Geller's parent, WPP Group PLC. Lord Einstein is under a temporary injunction barring it from accepting further Lord Geller business.    IBM says its list of agencies is &quot;small,&quot; and that it intends to spread its advertising business out over several U.S. agencies, rather than just one. But an IBM spokeswoman said the list is still &quot;fluid.&quot; The company hasn't decided how it will divide up the business, she said.    A logical move might be to divide the work into consumer-product advertising, business-products advertising, and corporate-image advertising.    Jordan McGrath has $280 million in total U.S. billings, mostly for packaged goods concerns including Quaker Oats Co. DDB Needham handled billings last year of about $1.6 billion, for clients including Anheuser Busch Cos.' Michelob and Bud Light brands, Hershey Foods Corp. and Campbell Soup Co.    DDB Needham, does have a potential conflict because its sister agency, BBDO Worldwide, handles advertising for Apple Computer Inc. But executives suggested DDB Needham might be asked to handle a portion of IBM's advertising in a way that would avoid conflict.    D'Arcy Masius handles annual billings of about $1.3 billion and creates advertising for Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Cincinnati, Ohio, and Anheuser Busch's Budweiser Brand.    Lintas, which handles annual U.S. billings of about $1.1 billion, recently purchased Muir Cornelius Moore, a major advertising agency that handled IBM sales promotion.    Geer Du Bois handled about $40 million in U.S. billings for IBM until two years ago, and has annual U.S. billings of about $115 million. </TEXT></DOC>
