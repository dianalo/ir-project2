The National Corn Growers Association, for example, says ethanolblends will be introduced this fall in the Phoenix, Ariz., area tocomply with the state's new clean air law.   Blended fuels, basically 10 percent ethanol and 90 percentgasoline, are said to cut automobile carbon monoxide emissions by asmuch as 25 percent. Another alternative is petroleum-based MTBE, ormethyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, which can reduce emissions by 10percent.   The corn producers said Denver initiated the nation's first fuelsprogram using ethanol and MTBE blends a year ago and that ``thesuccess of the Denver program was instrumental'' in passage ofArizona's clean air law.   An estimated 340 million bushels of corn were used to produce 800million gallons of ethanol for fuel blending last year, with blendsrepresenting 8 percent of all gasoline sales in 1988, theassociation said.   The Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based tradeassociation representing the ethanol industry, said more than 8.4billion gallons of ethanol-gasoline blends were sold in 42 stateslast year. The association said more than 60 ethanol plants areoperating in 23 states, representing a private investment of morethan $2.5 billion.   Ethanol use in gasoline to make ``gasohol'' was spurred by thesecond oil embargo by OPEC countries in the late 1970s, theassociation said, and by a rush of subsidies from the federal andstate governments.   The fervor at the time also prompted hopes that burdensome grainsurpluses could be used as feed stock, thus bolstering the nation'sfarm economy as well as contributing to the fuel supply.   ``What is even more significant is that this superior record ofgrowth has been sustained through good economic conditions andbad,'' the association said. ``This past year, unusually high grainprices caused by the drought and near-record low oil pricesthreatened to severely weaken this industry.''   But while three plants were forced to shut down temporarily,``little production capacity was lost and sales have remained quitestrong.''   The Agriculture Department has not viewed ethanol possibilitieswith the enthusiasm of the corn and industry associations. There areeconomic problems that won't go away simply because ethanol soundslike a good idea, says the department's Economic Research Service.   ``Ethanol gained support as it also promised environmentalbenefits and new markets and uses for corn and other surpluscrops,'' the agency said in a recent background paper. ``But thesense of urgency over the need to develop alternative fuelsdissipated as petroleum prices declined.''   But public attention once again is being drawn to alcohol fuelsto help reduce pollution, ease dependence on foreign oil and toprovide a greater market for farm crops.   ``Compliance deadlines of the Clean Air Act passed and thestandards are still unmet,'' the report said. ``U.S. petroleumimports have increased to the high levels of the early 1970s.''   As to the future, USDA analysts said ethanol's success willdepend on energy, environmental, agricultural and trade policies.Those are factors that will determine the prices, costs andcompetitiveness of the ethanol industry.   ``The U.S. fuel ethanol industry was created by a mix of federaland state subsidies, loan programs and other incentives,'' thereport said.   A handful of large plants produce most of the U.S. ethanol, thereport said. The eight largest, owned by five companies, accountedfor nearly 75 percent of the operating capacity in 1986.   ``Ethanol is exempt from 6 cents of the 9-cent (federal excise)tax through September 1993,'' the report said. ``At the 10 percentblending rate ... that exemption is effectively a 60-cent-per-gallonsubsidy. Many states provide similar financial incentives averaging20 to 30 cents per gallon.''   The federal government also helps with loan guarantees toencourage plant construction, but ``most of these plants have notbeen successful,'' the report said. Only one of the three plantswith loans guaranteed by the Energy Department was operating andpaying off its loans by early 1988.   At USDA's Farmers Home Administration, spokesman Marlyn Aycocksaid loan guarantees for 11 plants were initially obligated but thatonly three are currently in operation.   Aycock said FmHA has made no ethanol loans since 1984 and thatthe maximum had been reduced by half, from $20 billion per plant to$10 million.   The USDA background report said the production of ethanol so farhas ``not significantly affected income for farmers participating ingovernment commodity programs.   ``Moderate levels of ethanol production would only slightlyaffect total farm revenue and income,'' the report said. ``It isunlikely that modest increases in ethanol production would drivemarket prices for corn to exceed current target price levels (in thefederal commodity programs) within the next 8 to 10 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
