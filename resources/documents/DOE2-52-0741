The samplescollected are treated appropriately to provide solutions for analysis.Their analysis is carried out as follows. Each sample solution preparedis first neutralized with sodium hydroxide. After sodium carbonate isadded, the precipitate of strontium and calcium carbonates is separatedand the supernatant solution is used for cesium-137 determination. Thecarbonates are converted into oxalates, which are then dissolved in nitricacid. Strontium is separated by successive fuming nitric acid separation.The supernatant is acidified and cesium is absorbed on ammonium molybdophosphateadded. Stable strontium, calcium and potassium are also determined. Afterthe radiochemical separation, counting of radioactivity is performedusing low background beta counters normally for 60 to 90 min. From theresults, the concentrations of the nuclides in the original samples arecalculated. The contents of the substances in the samples are tabulated.(Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
