Glitman's detailed analysis was part of a thorough examinationof the pact signed 10 weeks ago by President Reagan and Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The treaty will eliminate allnuclear-tipped missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles.   Committee members say the detailed scrutiny is needed because ofdisputes about the meaning of past treaties, particularly the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   The current treaty is being considered by the Senate amid afight between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reaganadministration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact andwhether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developedunder the Strategic Defense Initiative.   Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treatysays neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, toundercut the pact.   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned aboutarticle 14'' because it might limit future U.S. help to other NATOnations.   ``If we don't spell out what the future obligations are,'' saidQuayle, ``down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is thetime to give us as much running room as possible in the future forour technology.''   But Glitman took the opposite approach, noting that the treatyis extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, alongwith their components.   ``If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' saidGlitman. Later, he added that ``we're best protected by statingwhat we cannot do.''   Glitman said the voluminous negotiating record is the bestdefense against future disputes about what is, and is not, coveredby the treaty.   He opposed suggestions by Quayle and other senators that sometype of amendment is needed to clarify Article 14.   The section is a standard clause which has been added to othertreaties and it simply restates the intention of both nations toabide by the pact, Glitman said.   Glitman cited one method in which he said U.S. aid to NATO wouldnot be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but itdoesn't block the transfer of U.S. technology to NATO nations suchas Great Britain to develop cruise missiles.   Glitman said the U.S. negotiating team resisted Soviet effortsto block U.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a wayto put a brake on NATO activities,'' he said.   Reagan promised Tuesday that the United States will do its partto ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying in anaddress broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled withyours.''   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on anymember nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, anattack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
