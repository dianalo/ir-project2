When the trial opened almost a year ago, the judge had to movethe proceedings to a larger courtroom at U.S. District Court toaccommodate a crush of reporters, lawyers and other spectators.   Now there's plenty of room available at the lower Manhattancourthouse. Reporters drop by occasionally, but few stories arefiled.   The testimony earlier this week of Boyd Jefferies, who oncepacked the house as government's star securities fraud witness,drew scant attention, even when he testified for the first timethat he assumed GAF Chairman Samuel J. Heyman directed the allegedscheme. It was the trial's first nugget of news.   Much of the third trial of the Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals makerand a top executive, which started Nov. 1, has been rehash. Despitethe mistrials _ one due to a procedural error, one to a hung jury _the substance hasn't changed.   The proceedings began last December as the first criminal trialstemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. OnWall Street it was seen as a test of whether the government couldwin securities convictions before a jury.   The case also marked the first courtroom appearance ofJefferies, a Los Angeles stockbroker linked to jailed speculatorIvan Boesky who agreed to testify in several cases as part of aplea deal with federal prosecutors.   GAF, two subsidiaries and vice chairman James T. Sherwin werecharged with stock manipulation for allegedly trying to boost UnionCarbide Corp.'s share price in 1986 shortly before selling a largeblock of its stock.   They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud andconspiracy, and the government made the case the opening act of ahalf dozen planned white-collar fraud trials.   But ``GAF I'' ended in a January mistrial after he governmentunintentionally withheld a key piece of evidence. In March, thejury in the second trial deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations.   Since then, GAF has lost its luster amid a series of flashiercases. The government has won jury convictions of Florida investorPaul Bilzerian and six executives in the Princeton-Newport Partnerstrial, plus several guilty pleas and the racketeering indictment offormer junk bond financier Michael Milken.   Speculation over whether Jefferies' testimony would earn him alenient sentence also ended. Jefferies, who testified againstBilzerian, was sentenced in July to probation for his guilty pleato two felonies.   ``It's no longer the first,'' said John J. Coffee Jr., aColumbia University securities law professor. ``Most of the othercases have been resolved. I think the world will focus on (Milken)and will not remember GAF.''   On Wednesday, for instance, three reporters attended part of theproceedings in Courtroom 705 _ smaller than the site of the firsttwo trials _ where GAF attorney Arthur Liman cross-examinedJefferies a second day. One reporter filed a story.   Liman attacked Jefferies' credibility by raising contradictionsin earlier trial testimony about when he talked to Sherwin, when hemade Union Carbide stock sales and where he kept yellow note padsin his office.   Jefferies appeared flustered this time around when he toldLiman: ``To be honest with you, this thing happened a long time agoand I put it out of my mind.''   But after a break he turned assertive, saying, ``I had acontract with Mr. Sherwin to perform a certain duty at the requestof the customer. I think he was very, very pleased.''   Jefferies said Sherwin asked him in October 1986 to inflate thestock price of Union Carbide and agreed to cover any losses. Thepurpose of the alleged deal was to maximize GAF's gain from thesale of Union Carbide stock after a failed takeover of the largerchemical company.   Sherwin, of Princeton, N.J., said in a courthouse interview thisweek that he has been working normally at GAF, which he joined in1960. While the media and lawyers may be uninterested, associatessay the lengthy case remains an ordeal for him.   Once a top U.S. chess player, Sherwin talked eagerly about a15-year-old Soviet boy, Gata Kamsky, who lived with Sherwin'sfamily briefly after a highly publicized defection in April.   ``We played ping pong and chess,'' said Sherwin, who ispresident of the American Chess Foundation. ``I could beat him inping pong.''</TEXT></DOC>
