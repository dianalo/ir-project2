No reason was given for rejecting the application by theCongress of South African Trade Unions to hold a march Saturday inVereeniging, an industrial city south of Johannesburg. The laborfederation, which had sought to protest legislation restrictingunions' ability to strike, threatened to defy the ban.   Since mid-September, the government has allowed numerous protestmarches nationwide, organized by trade unions and otheranti-apartheid groups. The government has approved Sunday's rallyat a soccer stadium near Johannesburg welcoming the freed AfricanNational Congress leaders.   Seven of the eight men to be honored were freed unconditionallyon Oct. 15 and the other was released in November 1987. Six weresentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along withNelson Mandela, the congress' best-known leader, who remains jailed.   White extremists have threatened to disrupt the rally withviolence, said Gen. Herman Stadler of the police public relationsdivision. Stadler said the threats were made in telephone callsfrom two men to the Afrikaans-language Free Weekly.   Organizers hope to draw at least 80,000 people to the rally,which would make it the largest anti-government gathering ever inSouth Africa. Buses and black-owned mini-bus taxis will bringpeople from distant communities.   Dozens of foreign diplomats have been invited to attend, saidMurphy Morobe, one of the organizers. On Thursday, diplomats from18 countries, including the United States and most of WesternEurope, visited Walter Sisulu, the highest ranking the freedAfrican National Congress leaders.   Under South Africa's Internal Security Act, it is crime topromote the objectives of the African National Congress, which haswaged an anti-government bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961.   Police will ``closely monitor'' the rally but will allow it toproceed, said a police spokesman, Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler.   Several Johannesburg newspapers today ran advertisments for therally that made no mention of the African National Congress. ButNew Nation, a militant anti-apartheid weekly, carried a full-pagedisplay of the program for the rally, under the heading ``ANCLives, ANC Leads, ANC Speaks.''   In an editorial, New Nation said the rally marks the start of anew phase ``in which we seek to reveal the ANC's centrality in thesolution of South Africa's problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
