Welcome in my guest house. Dutch beer?German beer? Tea? Pepsi? Welcome.''   The place is his own museum of kitsch and memorabilia: clocks,photographs, electronic gadgets, American cars, stamps, guns,garden gnomes, visiting cards, foreign money.   More than 100 clocks, most of them ticking, surround the bar andlounge, which are flooded by dozens of red lights, including someinside mushroom-shaped plastic stools.   On the hour, a chorus of cuckoo clocks and electronic beepsdrowns conversation.   Khoury, 66, opened the rest house in Maan 120 miles south ofAmman, the capital, in 1972.   It was frequented mainly by long-distance truck drivers on theirway from Europe to Saudi Arabia. As many as 40 trucks a day stoppedby, but a new road has been built and nowadays customers are few.   Maan is a town of 25,000 people, mainly traders, truckers andfarmers of Bedouin stock. The little oasis on the old Islamicpilgrimage route to Mecca is surrounded by a flat, monotonousdesert.   Khoury's brand of philosophy, and the accoutrements with whichhe surrounds himself, echo psychedelic hangouts in places otherthan a sun-baked outpost like this.   He philosphizes: ``Life without a wife is like a kitchen withouta knife. Another beer?''   Khoury must have one of the largest collections of portraits ofKing Hussein, big even for Jordan, where portraits of the monarchare everywhere.   The king is seen in dress white military uniform, wearing atraditional keffiyeh headdress, in a pilot's uniform, with each ofhis four wives, with his children, as a young monarch.   Hussein can be found dressed for soccer, cricket, riding,driving, flying, and meeting dozens of Arab and other leaders,including George Bush before he became president.   Electronic detectors beep, crow, ring, or squeal wheneversomeone enters the lounge or strides around the room.   Western rock or Arabic music blares from one of the six stereosbehind the bar. Four television sets are in various states ofrepair.   Khoury pulls out his stamp collection. Dozens are from Germany'sera of hyperinflation in 1922. One 100-mark stamp is overprinted``100 billion marks.''   In a garage outside sit two Chrysler New Yorkers, a PlymouthVolare and an Oldsmobile Toronado.   Khoury just sold a Dodge camper and he mourns: ``Bed inside.Fridge inside. I was crazy. Crazy to sell it.''   Amid the red ceiling fans, red cushions, red chairs and redcarpets, Khoury recounts his childhood and shows a 1932 photo ofhimself standing beside his father who wears a traditional whiteheaddress.   Although his family is from Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus inwhat since 1967 has been the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Khourysays he has spent much of his life in Maan.   Hundreds of business cards and currency from all over the worldattest to his cosmopolitan clientele, but Khoury says the bar maybe in danger of being closed down.   Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan are calling for a ban onalcohol.   ``They're trying to ban the rest house,'' he said. ``They'rewaiting for me to make a problem, so they can close me down.''   He opened a drawer under the bar to display a collection ofguns, picking them up one after the other, raising them above hishead.   ``I'm ready for them,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tuesday PMs, Nov. 28</NOTE></DOC>
