General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. eachsaid rebates and other inducements to lure buyers during theJuly-September period were much costlier this year and were largelyresponsible for the weakness.   The combined earnings for the Big Three during the three-monthperiod was $1.33 billion on revenues of $56.92 billion. Thatcompared with an industry third-quarter record profit last year of$1.83 billion on revenues of $56.48 billion.   ``I don't think it was a real big surprise,'' said analyst PaulKleinaitis of Duff andamp; Phelps, a Chicago investment research concern.   Boosting the Big Three's total profit figure was a one-time,$309 million increase in Chrysler's profits stemming from the saleof some of its stock in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in Japan during thequarter.   If that stock sale were removed, Big Three quarterly profitswould be $1.02 billion, 44.2 percent below last year's level.   GM's earnings fell 40 percent and Ford's income dropped 44.3percent during the period. Chrysler's profits nearly tripled on thestrength of the Mitsubishi stock sale, but without that boost, thecompany's earnings plummeted 80.4 percent.   Once again, Ford and GM profits benefited from overseasoperations. Chrysler has few overseas operations. Ford VicePresident and Treasurer David McCammon said his company lost $37million during the quarter domestically, mostly because ofincentives that averaged $800 a vehicle.   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan and Chrysler spokesman Tom Houstondeclined to say how much their companies spent on incentives.   Sullivan also declined to give North American profit figures forthe third quarter, but said that so far this year, all majorsegments of GM business are profitable.   The size of the drop at Ford caused some anxiety among industryanalysts, largely because the automaker has been so successful inmaking itself one of the most profitable companies in the world inrecent years.   ``That is a little worse than I expected,'' Kleinaitis said ofthe Ford decline. ``If Ford lost money, you can imagine that GM wascleaned out.''   Profit-sharing amounts for auto workers are based on a formularooted in North American earnings. Earlier this year, Ford workersgot about $2,800 each, Chrysler workers got checks for about $720apiece and GM employees got about $265 each in profit-sharing basedon 1988 North American earnings.   That's likely to change next spring when profit-sharing checksfor 1989 business are calculated.   ``Profit sharing will be down for the U.S. workers and will bedown substantially,'' McCammon said. However he said the checksstill would be ``meaningful'' and more than those for GM orChrysler workers.   GM, the nation's largest automaker, said it earned $516.9million on revenue of $28.79 billion during the period this year,compared with $859.2 million on revenue of $28.22 billion duringthe same time last year.   GM's profits could not be translated directly to a per-sharebasis because of a complex system of ownership of GM common, ClassE and Class H stocks.   For the first nine months of the year, GM reported earnings of$3.52 billion, up 1.7 percent from profits of $3.46 billion in theJanuary-September period last year.   GM's nine-month revenue totaled $95.57 billion, up from $91.21billion a year ago.   No. 2 Ford said it earned $477.1 million, or $1.03 per share ofcommon stock, during the third quarter this year, compared with$856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, during the same time last year.Revenue fell to $20.24 billion during the period this year from$20.38 billion in the third quarter of 1988.   For the first nine months of the year, Ford's earnings were down15 percent to $3.52 billion, or $7.51 a share, from $4.14 billion,or $8.53 a share. Revenue rose to $72 billion from $68.53 billion.   Chrysler, the nation's third-largest automaker, said it earned$331 million, or $1.42 a share, during the third quarter, comparedwith $112.5 million, or 50 cents a share, during the July-Septemberperiod last year.   Without the $309 million infusion from the Mitsubishi stocksale, Chrysler's third-quarter profits would been $22 million, or10 cents a share.   Chrysler's $7.88 billion in revenue for the quarter matched itsrevenue for the same period a year earlier.   For the first nine months of the year, Chrysler's profits rose15.8 percent to $714 million, or $3.06 a share, excluding profitsfrom the Mitsubishi sale. With the stock sale worked in, Chrysler'snine-month profit rose 65.9 percent to $1.02 billion, or $4.38 ashare.   Chrysler's revenue for the first nine months of this year roseto $27.95 billion, up from revenue of $25.78 billion during thesame time last year.   ``It's been a tough quarter,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacoccasaid.</TEXT></DOC>
