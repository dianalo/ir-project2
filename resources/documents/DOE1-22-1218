A report is given on thedesign of its upgrade control system. The feedback control system ismodified to be a multi-step pipelined system which is composed of twominicomputers for control calculation and a fast array processor, whichcalculates the state variables such as plasma position and shape priorto the control calculations.</TEXT></DOC>
