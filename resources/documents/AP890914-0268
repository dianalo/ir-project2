SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The industrial states of the Midwest andNortheast are pulling out of the population doldrums and addingpeople once again, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.   ``The industrial-based states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohiocontinue to recover from the early 1980s population losses,'' thebureau said. ``These three states added more population between 1986and 1988 than in the previous five years combined.''   In addition, the Northeast's population growth between 1985 and1988 was the highest since the late 1960s, the Bureau said.   And the report came just one day after the bureau and theDepartment of Agriculture reported that the nation's ruralpopulation had halted its long-term decline.   Growth was sluggish in states with energy-based economies, thebureau added, particularly Alaska, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, WestVirginia and Wyoming.   But the other trends notwithstanding, the bureau noted that thenation's overall growth pattern continues to favor Sun Belt stateslike California and Florida.   At least since 1970, the Western region has remained the fastestgrowing section of the nation, with the South second, the bureaunoted in the study ``State Population and Household Estimates, WithAge, Sex and Components of Change: 1981-88.''   ``The East North Central states increased by 443,000 from 1985 to1988 after population losses during the 1980-85 period,'' the reportsaid. ``Indiana, Michigan and Ohio added more population in thethree-year period between 1986 and 1988 than in the previoussix-year period.''   The Northeast lost population between 1975 and 1980 but has sincerecovered, the report said, and annual growth of 0.5 percent between1985 and 1988 is the highest since 1970. Indeed, half of NewEngland's growth between 1980 and 1988 has occurred just since 1985.   Slowed growth and population losses have plagued severalfarm-oriented states in recent years. But, the bureau concluded,``the downward slide seems to have reversed last year.'' Iowa showeda slight new immigration, as did Nebraska, and South Dakota hasslowed its outmigration enough to experience population growth fortwo consecutive years.   The sluggish population growth in energy-dependent states is acontinuing problem, with West Virginia losing people every year inthis decade and even Texas, which added 59,000 people in the yearending July 30, 1988, far below its peak growth of 1981-82, when itagined 609,000.   In fact, Texas experienced net outmigration last year, for thesecond year in a row, the report said.   Here is a state-by-state list showing the population of thestates according to the 1980 census and the estimates for 1985 and1988, in thousands.</TEXT><TEXT>   State    1988  1985  1980Ala.    4,102 4,021 3,894Alaska    524  521  402Ariz.   3,489 3,161 2,718Ark.    2,395 2,360 2,286Calif. 28,314 26,353 23,688Colo.   3,301 3,232 2,890Conn.   3,233 3,175 3,108Del.      660  626  594D.C.      617  623  638Fla.   12,335 11,367 9,746Ga.     6,342 5,975 5,463Hawaii  1,098 1,050  965Idaho   1,003 1,005  994Ill.   11,614 11,539 11,427Ind.    5,556 5,500 5,490Iowa    2,834 2,873 2,914Kan.    2,495 2,448 2,364Ky.     3,727 3,724 3,661La.     4,408 4,484 4,206Maine   1,205 1,164 1,125Md.     4,622 4,391 4,217Mass.   5,889 5,823 5,737Mich.   9,240 9,088 9,262Minn.   4,307 4,191 4,076Miss.   2,620 2,613 2,521Mo.      5,1415,0364,917Mont.     805  825  787Neb.    1,602 1,605 1,570Nev.    1,054  939  800N.H.    1,085  998  921N.J.    7,721 7,568 7,365N.M.    1,507 1,450 1,303N.Y.   17,909 17,767 17,558N.C.    6,489 6,258 5,882N.D.      667  685  653Ohio   10,855 10,774 10,798Okla.   3,242 3,302 3,025Ore.    2,767 2,688 2,633Pa.    12,001 11,865 11,864R.I.      993  967  947S.C.    3,470 3,333 3,122S.D.      713  708  691Tenn.   4,895 4,766 4,591Texas  16,841 16,382 14,229Utah    1,690 1,644 1,461Vt.       557  535  511Va.     6,015 5,704 5,347Wash.   4,648 4,407 4,132W.
