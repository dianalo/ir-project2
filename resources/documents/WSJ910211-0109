Ratings on RJR senior bonds were raised to double-B-1 fromdouble-B-3. Those bonds were issued before RJR was takenprivate in a leveraged buy-out in early 1989. Ratings onRJR's 15% and zero-coupon bonds were lifted to double-B-3from single-B-2. Ratings on RJR's 17% and 17 3/8%subordinated bonds were raised to single-B-1 from single-B-3.</LP><TEXT>   In the past eight months, RJR has taken various steps thatmore than double its equity. The company's main shareholder,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., last July provided a $1.7billion equity infusion. RJR currently also is issuing $800million market value of stock to the public in abond-exchange offer.   Those steps &quot;represent a shift in ownership philosophywhich over time will enhance debtholder protection,&quot; Moody'ssaid.   The rating concern added that after RJR's exchange offeris completed, it expects RJR's operating earnings -- orprofit before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation-- will equal 1.5 to 1.8 times the company's debt-servicecosts. That will be up substantially from about 1.0 times inthe first two years of the RJR buy-out. Higher ratios areconsidered better for bondholders.   RJR's bonds have surged in price the past few weeks, asinvestors became more bullish about the company'screditworthiness. The bonds were little changed Friday afterMoody's announced its rating action.   Even after the upgrade, RJR's bonds remain in thespeculative, or &quot;junk&quot; bond, category. Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp. rates RJR's senior bonds double-B and its subordinateddebt single-B-plus.   Securities analysts speculated that it could take 1 1/2 totwo years for RJR's senior bonds to be upgraded to atriple-B, or investment-grade, rating. The company'screditworthiness is likely to improve steadily, analystssaid, but they observed that rating concerns generally waitsome time before raising a junk-bond issuer's credit ratingagain.   RJR had held an investment-grade rating for decades beforeits buy-out, which means a return to that status wouldprobably have a big psychological significance at thecompany. An investment-grade rating would also make it easierfor RJR to refinance its debts at lower cost.</TEXT></DOC>
