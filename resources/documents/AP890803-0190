LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel welcomed the decision of Lebanesecaptors to suspend their death sentence on an American, but stuckto its position of freeing a Shiite Moslem cleric only in a tradefor hostages.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization had said it would killJoseph Cicippio, but released a handwritten statement 45 minutesbefore the deadline saying it had suspended the death threat andincluding new demands.   In addition to Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clericabducted by Israel, it now wants the release of ``Palestinian andLebanese'' guerrillas in Israeli jails. It said the names would begiven to the Red Cross.   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise theinitiative will be considered canceled,'' the kidnappers said,without explaining what the vague language meant.   ``I can tell you that all the sides now have more time,'' said asenior Defense Ministry official.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem: ``Ifindeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal forprisoners exchange, we shall examine it on a positive basis.''   Officials declined to say whether they believed the new demandsprovided an opening for negotiations.   ``What remains to be seen is whether Hezbollah is ready to dobusiness and ready to negotiate the exchange we have proposed. Thisis why we are cautious,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir.   Obeid is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian groupbelieved to be responsible for the kidnapping Westerners in Lebanon.   Yossi Ahimeir, a top Shamir aide, insisted Cicippio be freedbefore negotiations.   ``Cicippio should be released immediately,'' he added. ``Heshould go back to his family. He is an innocent man.''   Other Israeli officials expressed concern over a reference tofreeing Palestinian prisoners from the uprising in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip. That could include more than 8,000Palestinian detainees.   Earlier Thursday, Israel issued a plea for the Shiites not tocarry out the threatened killing of Cicippio but said it would freeObeid only if it got back Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages.   ``We still stick to our position that we are ready to exchangekidnap victims and hostages,'' Ahimeir said. ``Our goal is torescue, save our people in Lebanon in the hands of severalorganizations there.''   The Lebanese captors on Thursday released a videotaped plea fromCicippio, who called for the release of Obeid and added: ``Don't belate ... because they are very serious.''   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid from his home in south Lebanonon July 28. Israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed thekidnapping of Lt. Co. William R. Higgins, a U.S. Marine servingwith U.N peacekeepers, in February 1988.   Higgins' captors said they hanged him Monday.   Ahimeir reported ``all kinds of consultations'' within thegovernment about the hostage crisis.   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Shamir, said Israel was in``constant touch'' with the U.S. government, but he would not saywhether Shamir had talked by telephone with President Bush.   The Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of West Germany,Italy and Britain, whose citizens are among the hostages inLebanon, and also the Japanese envoy.   Israel radio said the Japanese ambassador was called in becauseJapan was involved in contacts with Iran. The radio gave no detailsand ministry officials could not be reached for comment.   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape of a man whoappeared to be the Marine colonel hanging from a gallows. There wasno way of telling when the tape was made, conflicting reports havearisen about when he was killed.   A Defense Ministry statement said Obeid told interrogators hebelieved Higgins was alive last week.   The statement said Israel continued to believe Higgins waskilled late last year. Officials said they might give Obeid to alie-detector test to determine what he knew about the Americanofficer.</TEXT></DOC>
