Comparison with known experimental data leads to the conclusionthat in actual He--Ne/{sup 127}I{sub 2} lasers ({lambda} = 633 nm), frequencyshift and asymmetry of the saturated absorption spike are due mainlynot to the lens effect, but most likely to collisions in iodine vapor.The possible cause of linearity of the modulated frequency shift at smalldeviation amplitudes observed in experiment is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
