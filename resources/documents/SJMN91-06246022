AFTER THE GAME  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The coup's aftermath; See also related article on page 1A, 16A-22A of thissection.  </MEMO><TEXT>     ABC news executives insist the timing wasn't their idea, but sometime after9 p.m. today, Tuesday morning Moscow time and after midnight on the EastCoast, the presidents of the Soviet Union and the Russian republic are goingto be &quot;Monday Night Football's&quot; postgame show.;   If the San Francisco-NewYork game ends on time, if a new crisis doesn't erupt in the Soviet Union, ifABC's guests aren't called away to a legislative debate scheduled for laterthat morning, then the two Soviet leaders will indeed respond to questionsforwarded by ABC's Peter Jennings in New York from selected Americans in fiveto 10 cities around the country, including San Francisco.;   There will neverhave been anything like it, a fact that has specialists in media and politicsgroping for words.;   &quot;The whole thing is a sort of bizarre and fascinatingsign of the times,&quot; said University of Maryland political scientist GeorgeQuester.;   &quot;No world leader, not the American president or anyone else, hasever done this,&quot; said Rick Kaplan, executive producer of the show.;   &quot;Yourjaw just drops at that juxtaposition of high politics and mass mania,&quot; saidSuzanne Garment of the American Enterprise Institute.;   &quot;Get on Americanmedia and you're sure of getting to the whole rest of the world,&quot; saidLawrence Lichty of the Woodrow Wilson Media Studies Center. &quot;The entire worldis turning out to be like an American political campaign.&quot;;   That has becomeparticularly true in the last couple of years, as correspondents have reportedlive on invasion, war, revolution and their participants around the world.;  One party line; &quot;Everybody is listening in on the same party line,&quot; Questersaid. &quot;In a way, that's great because it undermines dictatorship. Beyond thatit means a leveling out where everybody is a household figure everywhere.&quot;;  No one knows for certain what has motivated Gorbachev and Yeltsin to becomeever more familiar household figures as guests at the most elaborate talk showin history, but there is some agreement on what they probably are hoping:;  &quot;I guess we can assume one thing they want is Western aid,&quot; Garment said, andthe pair are willing to take some long-distance televised heat to improvetheir image with U.S. officials, business leaders and the American public.;  It also might not hurt their image among skeptical citizens back home, wherethe show also will appear.;   &quot;Leaders have gone to foreign countries to helpthemselves domestically again and again,&quot; Kaplan said.;   &quot;And the fact of thematter is that, realistically, if they're going to make their own revolutionor re-revolution work, they're going to have to attract American interest,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Sometimes you do what needs to be done.&quot;;   Football audience; Kaplanknows whereof he speaks. Despite the apparent advantage of having the bigseason-premiere football audience available just before the Soviets go on, hewould rather run his show any other time than half past midnight in the East-- or later.;   &quot;They picked Monday night. We didn't,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;We wantedany other night, in the 11:30 p.m. time slot.&quot;;   But that's 6:30 a.m. Moscowtime, and the two political celebrities are facing a busy week. So Soviet TVofficials responding to Arledge's request for the joint appearance saidTuesday at 7:30 a.m. in Moscow was the best they could do.;   &quot;It's too latefor most people in the East,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;It's past newspaper deadlines. . .. And what if there's an overtime game? What if there are three overtimes? Atsome point we're going to have to start the program, because they're clearlynot going to just sit around. . . .;   &quot;At some point we would just do it ontape. But do you run the tape at 2 a.m.? You can drive yourself crazy thinkingof the possibilities.&quot;;   Selected questioners; One possibility that's alwaysavailable in such shows is the utterly embarrassing question, but ABC isselecting 10 to 12 people in each of the cities as their potentialquestioners, to keep the show respectable and generally serious.;   Kaplanimagines Cubans from Miami asking about Castro, business people asking whythey should risk investment in an unstable Soviet Union, others wondering whohas a finger on the nuclear button, others perhaps wondering &quot;How's Mrs.Gorbachev?&quot;;   Arledge, mastermind of both &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and ABC'slive town-meeting format, will be in the studio with Gorbachev and Yeltsin,making sure everything works at that end. But depending on what happensstateside, Arledge himself might ask one of the most important questions ofthe night:;   &quot;Is anybody in field-goal range?&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY BLONSTON, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910902  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  876  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 2, 199100246022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
