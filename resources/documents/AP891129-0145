The U.S. Space Command in Colorado, which tracks objects inspace, said it did not know where on the globe the 10-year-oldsatellite might fall because a few minutes one way or another canmean hundreds of miles. The impact point will be estimated moreclosely as the time of the satellite's demise comes nearer.   Solar Max has been studying the sun since it was launched inFebruary 1980. It ran out of fuel recently and began tumbling outof control. NASA jettisoned its solar panels last week, deprivingthe satellite of power.   The 5,000-pound spacecraft will be mostly destroyed by fire, butsome larger pieces may survive and fall in chunks to Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
