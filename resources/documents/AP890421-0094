Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamiccountry such as Jordan. The Islamic holy book, the Koran, calls onMoslems to participate in the ceremony and most take it as abinding duty.   Residents and security forces said about 500 people hurledstones at police and demolished five police cars this afternoon inthe city of Salt, 10 miles northwest of Amman.   Police said the city had been blocked off, joining the southerntowns of Maan, Kerak, Mutah, Mazar and others.   Residents of Maan, 120 miles south of Amman, and nearby citiessaid in telephone interviews that soldiers prevented prayergatherings and ordered people to stay home.   Relatives of Communist Party members said the governmentarrested as many as 100 party members overnight, apparently inconnection with the disturbances, which have killed eight peoplesince Tuesday.   The protests marked the worst violence in Jordan since the armycrushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71.   The communists' relatives told The Associated Press thatintelligence officers raided the homes of party members in Ammanand the northern cities of Irbid, Madaba, Zarqa and Fuheis.   Hours earlier, the party had distributed a leaflet calling onthe government to rescind prices rises that triggered the rioting.   The leaflet also demanded the government scrap an austerityprogram aimed at dealing with Jordan's economic problems, whichinclude a $6 billion foreign debt and 20 percent unemployment.   Government officials, as is common, did not report the arrests.   Rioting apparently spread to northern Jordan for the first timeThursday night.   A security official speaking on condition of anonymity saidprotesters in Irbid burned trucks and tires and clashed with policeThursday night. Irbid is 40 miles north of the capital.   Mayor Mahmoud Al-Awneh of Tayyba, anothern northern town, said1,000 people protested there Thursday night, breaking windows inthe school and town hall.   In Madaba, 20 miles south of Amman, windows were smashed in abank and municipal building. Residents said 100 people demonstratedThursday night.   Police manned trucks mounted with machine guns at keyintersections in several towns today, the Moslem day of prayer whenworshipers usually visit mosques. Troops also were deployed inAmman, which has been free of violence.   An official statement read over state-run Jordan Radio gaveJordanians the first official details of the rioting to be reportedinternally.   It said police were ``trying to determine the persons and thesides behind all these pitiful incidents and to learn about theirmotives.''   Officials earlier had hinted that Moslem fundamentalists mighthave encouraged the disturbances.   Crown Prince Hassan, younger brother of King Hussein, said in aninterview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday thateight people had been killed and about 30 wounded in the rioting,which broke out Tuesday in Maan and spread to other southern cities.   The region is noted for its support of Hussein, but incomesthere are generally low.   The statement today said one policeman and four civilians diedin Maan. It blamed the deaths on ``shooting by the rioters.'' Maanresidents said the four civilians were killed by security forces.They said rioters also fired guns.   The statement said the riots started when taxi drivers ``incitedschoolchildren and citizens of Maan to demonstrate over the priceincrease'' imposed Sunday as part of an agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund to reschedule Jordan's debt.   Many rioters have blamed Prime Minister Zaid Rifai for theausterity measures and demanded his ouster.   The measures include a 25 percent increase in the price ofgasoline, to $1.65 per gallon, and increases of 10 percent to 50percent in the price of cigarettes, cooking gas, heating oil andother products. Living standards have fallen sharply over the pastyear and unemployment is nearly 20 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
