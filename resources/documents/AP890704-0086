A federal jury deliberated about 16 hours over four days beforereturning the verdict Monday against the last two defendants caughtin the FBI's Operation Incubator probe into corruption at City Hall.   Twnety-four other public officials already were convicted in theinvestigation in Chicago and New York City.   Morgan Finley, 63, who served as chief administrator of the CookCounty court until November, was convicted on charges ofracketeering conspiracy, attempted extortion and interstate travelto aid a racketeering scheme.   Clarence McClain, 47, who served the late mayor briefly butremained a close friend after leaving Washington's administration,was convicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy, attemptedextortion, interstate travel to aid a racketeering scheme, tax fraudand mail fraud.   ``The message here is that people who get paid off have to paythe price,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Shepard, one ofthree federal prosecutors in the case.   Finley was acquitted on three of the nine counts against him inthe original indictment. McClain was acquitted on five of 16 countsagainst him.   U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner set sentencing for July 25.Finley faces a maximum of 105 years in prison and $1.5 million infines. McClain faces a maximum of 145 years and $2.5 million.   ``We gave it our best shot,'' said McClain's attorney, PhilParenti, adding that no decision had been made yet on whether toappeal.   But Finley's attorney, Louis Garippo, said his client wouldappeal, citing ``pretrial rulings limiting exploration of themotives of (FBI informant) Michael Raymond.''   Raymond, a convicted swindler, was the central figure in theundercover investigation. Operation Incubator netted 16 convictionsin Chicago and spawned a probe in New York City that led to 10convictions, including that of Stanley M. Friedman, Democraticchairman of the Bronx.   Friedman and four co-defendants were found guilty in a scheme toget a $22.7 million Parking Violations Bureau contract for hand-heldcomputers through a pattern of racketeering. He was sentenced to 12years in prison.   Raymond became an informant after being arrested in July 1984 inTennessee on weapons charges. He agreed to pose in Chicago as abusinessman trying to bribe his way into lucrative city contractsfor collecting overdue parking fines and water bills.   He often wined and dined politicians in a posh lakefrontapartment as FBI agents taped the proceedings from next door.   When the investigation was disclosed in December 1985, some ofthe politicians and allies of Washington contended it was an attemptto embarrass his administration.   Many others criticized the government's use of an unsavorycharacter like Raymond as an informant.   But prosecutor Ira Raphaelson defended the use of Raymond as ``amethod of getting behind the closed door where most publiccorruption takes place.   ``We did not use him as a witness,'' he added. ``We used him as amicrophone.''</TEXT></DOC>
