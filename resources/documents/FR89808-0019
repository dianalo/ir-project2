Background </ITAG>Section 207(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (the Act) requires motor vehiclemanufacturers to warrant that each new vehicle is designed, built, andequipped to conform to the applicable Federal emission standards. The vehiclemanufacturer must also warrant that the vehicle is free from defects whichwould cause the vehicle or engine to fail to conform to the applicableregulations within the useful life of the vehicle. Section 207(b) of theAct directs EPA to promulgate rules requiring vehicle manufacturers toalso warrant the performance of certified emission related parts or systems(the performance warranty) for the useful life of the vehicle, if EPA determinesthat testing methods and procedures are available to determine if a vehicleis in compliance with applicable emission standards during its useful life.EPA promulgated these emission control system performance warranty regulationson May 22, 1980 (45 FR 34829). Proper maintenance and use of a vehicleare prerequisites to section 207(b) performance warranty coverage. EPA also promulgated regulations, as authorized by section 207(a)(2) ofthe Act, that allow automotive part manufacturers to certify their partsas equivalent to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts (45 FR 78448,November 25, 1980). Vehicle manufacturers cannot deny a performance warrantyclaim on the ground that use of an aftermarket part is improper maintenanceor repair if the part is certified under the voluntary aftermarket partcertification regulations. Thus, consumers can use certified aftermarketparts without jeopardizing their emission control performance warranties.Further, the consumer can purchase certified parts knowing that they havebeen evaluated for emission performance. The vehicle manufacturers are required by section 207(b) to honor warrantiesfor vehicles equipped with certified aftermarket parts. However, the certifiedpart manufacturer is required to reimburse the vehicle manufacturer ifthe certified part caused the emissions failure.The regulations promulgated in 1980 limited certification to thirteen specificreplacement parts. For each of these parts, the regulations defined uniquedurability procedures and emission critical parameters (ECP's). ECP's arethose physical and performance characteristics of a part which, if duplicated(or exceeded), will result in satisfactory emission performance. Manufacturersof the thirteen specific parts covered by the regulations could certifyby evaluating their parts according to these ECP procedures or, at themanufacturer's option, on the basis of Federal Test Procedure (FTP) emissionresults and such other evaluation as approved by the Administrator of EPA.Vehicle manufacturers and part manufacturers challenged several aspectsof the aftermarket part certification regulations and the emission controlsystem performance warranty regulations.\4\<NOTE/> On October 14, 1983, the United States Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit ruled on the petitions. The court's decisionbasically upheld the regulations. However, the court directed EPA to makeor consider amendments to the following areas. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>SEMA</T3> v. <T3>Ruckelshaus,</T3> 720 F.2d at 124; <T3>APRA</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 720 F.2d at 142. A. Specialty Parts The original regulations specifically excluded add-on or specialty partsfrom the aftermarket part certification program since there were no recognizedemission critical parameter evaluation procedures for these parts. Thisexclusion was challenged by manufacturers of specialty parts. The courtruled that even if emission critical parameter evaluation procedures werenot available, manufacturers of specialty parts should at least be allowedto certify on the basis of FTP test results unless EPA could provide areasoned explanation for excluding these parts from certification. Thus,EPA proposed to allow specialty parts to be certified on the basis of FTPresults. Additionally, although not directed by the court to do so, EPAproposed amendments which would allow manufacturers of all types of aftermarketemission related parts to certify on the basis of FTP results. This proposalwould greatly expand the number and types of parts eligible for aftermarketpart certification. B. Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) Short Tests The original regulations denied the use of I/M type short tests\5\<NOTE/> for aftermarket part certification, relying instead on eitherthe emission critical parameter procedures or FTP test results. Aftermarketpart manufacturers argued in favor of certification based on the I/M-typeshort tests since, in practice, these short tests were used to determineemission compliance for performance warranty purposes. The court directedEPA to reconsider its policy and technical reasons for rejecting shorttests. EPA did so in the NPRM, explaining that existing short tests arenot a substitute for the FTP, the concern for potential emission degradationif certification via short tests were widely used, and the expected increasein performance warranty emission failures if short test certification wasallowed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Short test are relatively quick, inexpensive tests ordinarilyused by States in inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs to screen vehiclesin use for compliance with certain emission standards. Failure of a shorttest approved under section 207(b) of the Act may result in a performancewarranty claim.  C. Reimbursement Plan As required by the original regulations, a motor vehicle manufacturer hasto honor a consumer emission performance warranty claim, provided the vehiclefailed to meet emission standards during its useful life and has been properlyused and maintained with OEM parts or certified aftermarket parts. However,the motor vehicle manufacturer can require reimbursement from the certifiedpart manufacturer for ``reasonable expenses'' incurred in the repair ofa vehicle if a ``valid emission performance warranty claim'' arose becauseof the use of the certified aftermarket part. The original regulationsdid not define the two terms ``reasonable expense'' and ``valid emissionperformance warranty claim,'' nor did they specify a reimbursement planfor the manufacturers to follow in the event of a dispute between the twoparties. The motor vehicle manufacturers and representatives of parts rebuilderscontended that the two terms, ``reasonable expense'' and ``valid emissionperformance warranty claim,'' were too vague to provide meaningful guidanceto part manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers; the court agreed. Thecourt required that EPA either apply its expertise in the area and definethe terms within the regulations, or provide a forum in which the termswould be clarified through an adversarial process, such as arbitration.EPA improved the definition of these terms and proposed the adoption ofan arbitration process to be followed when other attempts to settle a claimare unsuccessful. D. Warranty Denial The regulations allow a manufacturer to deny emission performance warrantyto a customer if a vehicle's emission performance failure was traced toan uncertified aftermarket part. The original regulations required thevehicle manufacturer to ``present evidence that an uncertified part ona vehicle was defective, or not equivalent, from an emission standpoint,to an OEM part'' before the manufacturer could be free of emission performancewarranty responsibility.\6\<NOTE/> Vehicle manufacturers argued that demonstrating that a partwas either defective or not equivalent to an OEM part placed an excessiveburden on them. The court cautioned EPA not to ``shift * * * the burdenof demonstrating equivalency * * * to the vehicle manufacturers''\7\<NOTE/> but permitted EPA to ``* * * require vehicle manufacturersto submit a statement (or other evidence) indicating why an uncertifiedpart was relevant to the vehicles' [emission] failure * * *.''\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 40 CFR 85.2105(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>APRA</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 720 F.2d at 157. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Ibid. at 158 n.63EPA proposed to allow the vehicle manufacturer to deny a warranty claimif it can make a technical determination that the uncertified aftermarketpart was at fault and provide the consumer with a written assertion andsupporting objective evidence that the uncertified part was at fault andthat restoring the vehicle to OEM condition would repair the emission problem.Finally, vehicle manufacturers argued the need for permanent labels oridentification symbols on certified parts. EPA concurred with the vehiclemanufacturers and, although not directed to do so by the court, proposedpermanent labeling requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Final Rule </ITAG>These final rules permit all aftermarket part manufacturers to voluntarilycertify their emission related parts. The previously existing method ofcertifying eligible parts using ECP's is unchanged by these rules. Therefore,manufacturers of the thirteen types of parts currently eligible to certifyusing ECP criteria are still allowed to certify these parts by that method.\9\<NOTE/> However, today's action provides an alternative means ofcertifying parts which does not rely on ECP procedures. Utilizing thisalternative method, the regulations also expand eligibility for voluntarycertification to all emission related aftermarket parts.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The thirteen currently eligible parts are listed in 40CFR 85.2122.  The alternative method relies on FTP test results to demonstrate that useof the aftermarket part will not result in an unacceptable emissions increasecompared to the vehicle in its original equipment (OE) configuration. The alternative method also requires some form of durability demonstrationfor certain parts, depending on the potential emissions impact of the partto be certified. These final rules establish two categories of durabilitydemonstration requirements for parts. The first category consists of partswhich, when excessively   deteriorated or failed in-use, will result indriveability problems likely to be quickly corrected. No durability testingis required for these parts to ensure continued emissions compliance. Thesecond category consists of parts for which durability testing is requiredto demonstrate emissions compliance. The failure of these parts in-usewill likely not cause driveability problems which would be automaticallyrepaired. Vehicle manufacturers will continue to be required to repair vehicles whichfail in-use emission tests and are covered by the Act's section 207(b)emission warranty. If the warranty repair requires replacement of a defectiveor deteriorated certified aftermarket part, the vehicle manufacturer willmake that repair without charge to the customer. The vehicle manufactureris entitled to reimbursement from the manufacturer of the certified aftermarketpart for reasonable costs incurred while repairing emissions failure causedby the aftermarket part. These final regulations establish reimbursementprocedures for warranty cost claims between vehicle and certified aftermarketpart manufacturers. The regulations also expand and clarify the meaningof reasonable expense and a valid emission performance warranty claim.This provides additional guidance for resolving reimbursement disputesthat may arise. EPA prefers that disputes between vehicle manufacturersand aftermarket part manufacturers over warranty cost claims be resolvedinformally. Disputes which cannot be resolved informally will be decidedthrough arbitration. These revised regulations prohibit denial of warranty coverage involvingan uncertified part unless the vehicle manufacturer determines and documentsto the consumer that the uncertified part was relevant to the failure.The regulations provide the requirements the vehicle manufacturer mustmeet to make such a denial. The revised regulations also require that each certified aftermarket partbe identified with a unique and durable label. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Final Rulemaking\10\<NOTE/>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In this section, where appropriate, EPA responds to certaincomments on the NPRM. Responses to other significant comments are in the``Summary and Analysis of Comments'' which has been placed in the publicdocket for this rulemaking.  A. Certification of Aftermarket Parts <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Eligibility </ITAG>The regulations promulgated in 1980 which established the voluntary certificationprogram for aftermarket parts, limited certification to thirteen partswhich had defined  ECP (emission critical parameter) categories. As a resultof the court case brought by aftermarket specialty part industry representatives,EPA was directed to either develop further its reasoning for limiting certificationaccess or provide a means by which other emission related aftermarket partscan be certified.\11\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The court case only directed EPA to reconsider certificationof specialty parts. <T3>SEMA </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>720 F.2d at 137-138. However, EPA has decided itis appropriate to include all emission related parts in this category. As proposed in the NPRM and set forth in these final rules, all manufacturersof emission related aftermarket parts are now eligible to participate inthe voluntary certification process. EPA has developed testing criteriafor the certification of emission related parts. These testing criteriawill give reasonable assurance that use of these parts will not cause vehiclesto fail to meet emission standards.While EPA is allowing emission related specialty (i.e., add-on) parts toparticipate in this certification program, the main purpose of this programis to facilitate the maintenance and repair of an owner's vehicle by makinggood quality parts available for that purpose. It is not EPA's intentionto encourage repair facilities to remove a primary OEM emission controlcomponent that is still properly operating (i.e., a low mileage part withno overt or driveability malfunction) in order to install a certified aftermarketpart. While certified aftermarket parts must undergo testing that demonstratestheir compliance with warranty requirements, the part manufacturer doesnot have to demonstrate a part's durability and emission performance asextensively as a vehicle manufacturer must do in certifying a vehicle.While EPA sees that increased part availability as a result of this certificationprogram will generally be beneficial, use of a certified aftermarket partto replace a properly functioning OEM component may not always be in thebest interest of air quality. Thus, EPA intends to monitor the use of certifiedparts. If the Agency determines that these parts are being used in a mannerthat is detrimental to air quality, EPA will consider amending these regulationsto address that situation. Consistent with EPA's past practice, the certifying manufacturer of anaftermarket part must not only demonstrate the part complies with emissionstandards during certification demonstration, but also attest that thepart does not cause a substantial increase to emissions in any other normalvehicle driving mode not represented during certification or compliancetesting. Parts that cannot meet these demonstration criteria are calleddefeat devices. For example, EPA is concerned about electronic devicessuch as replaceable PROM's (programmable read only memory chips) whichstore many of the operating parameters of the emission control system usedby the vehicle's on-board computer. Aftermarket PROM's could be programmedto operate adequately under Inspection/Maintenance testing or under FTPtesting, yet cause a substantial loss in emission control in normal vehicleoperating modes not represented by one or both of these two test cycles.This might be due to lack of design sophistication or deliberate designintent (i.e., performance enhancement). Whatever the cause, if EPA obtainsdata showing that a part is a defeat device, that part will be decertified.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Warranty Obligations </ITAG>The final rules clarify the existing requirement (40 CFR 85.2117) thatall certified aftermarket parts must be warranted by the part manufacturernot to cause emission noncompliance of the vehicle on which it is installed.The amended rules clarify that this warranty applies for the remainderof the useful life of the vehicle on which the part is installed. The originalvehicle manufacturer is required to honor all valid emission performancewarranty claims involving any and all properly installed certified parts.\12\<NOTE/> The vehicle manufacturer may then obtain reimbursement fromthe certified part manufacturer for a valid warranty claim caused by thecertified part according to procedures described later in these final rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ If an original vehicle manufacturer's authorized servicefacility improperly installs a certified part, the vehicle manufactureris still required to honor the performance warranty claim.  The basic performance warranty requirements contained in 40 CFR 85.2103for vehicles are unchanged by these amendments. However, certain clarificationis warranted here. Basically, the owner is eligible for warranty repairif his or her vehicle has been properly maintained and used yet fails anEPA approved state or local I/M test during the vehicle's useful life andthe owner is required to seek repair of the vehicle or incur some othersanction. Of particular interest to this rulemaking, the vehicle manufactureris required to repair or replace without charge those certified emissionrelated components necessary to remedy that emission failure if it occurswithin the prescribed warranty period. Warranted components include allOEM emission related components and any certified aftermarket componentinstalled on the vehicle. For vehicles in operation less than 24 monthsor 24,000 miles, any emission related repairs to the vehicle are coveredby the warranty. After 24 months or 24,000 miles, only those parts installedfor the sole or primary purpose of reducing emissions are covered by theperformance warranty. Certified parts and systems shall be warranted for the remaining warrantyperiod of the vehicle. Since these parts could be installed on a vehiclewith low mileage, the part manufacturer must be prepared to warrant itsparts for the full warranty period of the vehicle (e.g., for the full usefullife of 5 years or 50,000 miles for primary emission control devices installedon light-duty vehicles). Since the OEM is only required to warrant certainemission related parts for 2 years or 24,000 miles under the performancewarranty, the aftermarket part manufacturer is likewise only required towarrant its comparable parts for that same period, even if the OEM is requiredto warrant its part for an interval greater than the 2 years or 24,000miles under the defect warranty. In the NPRM, EPA proposed an option that would have allowed vehicle manufacturersto deny warranty coverage to a vehicle owner when a certified specialtypart was determined to be the cause of a performance warranty claim. EPAhad suggested that since specialty parts were typically add-on parts notused primarily for maintenance and repair, as specifically covered in thewarranty provisions of section 207(b) of the Act, they could be deniedwarranty repair by the vehicle manufacturer if the failure was relatedto the add-on part. Under this proposed option the vehicle owner wouldgo directly to the certified specialty part manufacturer for warranty coverage.A number of commenters pointed out problems with the definition of specialtyparts in the NPRM. It was unclear whether the NPRM definition of specialtyparts included parts which provide a necessary repair or replacement functionas well as an additional feature or function. Commenters contended thatthese parts do not fit the definition proposed by EPA. They stated thatconsumers may buy these parts for convenience and/or cost savings, withno intention of altering the vehicle's emission system. This is contraryto EPA's contention in the NPRM that consumer's generally purchase specialtyparts with the knowledge and intent of altering the vehicle's emissioncontrol system. Thus, these commenters requested that specialty parts shouldbe treated the same as all other certified aftermarket parts and that OEmanufacturers should not be allowed to deny warranty repairs for problemscaused by a certified specialty part. Based on these comments, EPA can see difficulties in clearly defining whatconstitutes a specialty part. The difficulty rests in determining whethera part provides a repair or maintenance function to warrant certification.It appears that many parts will fall into this category of providing botha replacement/maintenance function and some additional, unnecessary enhancement.On the other hand, in their comments to the NPRM, vehicle manufacturerssupported the optional treatment of certified specialty parts based onthe concern that OEM dealerships would not know how to diagnose and repairproblems caused by specialty parts which were designed to perform substantiallydifferent functions than OEM parts. However, as indicated above, many partsthat normally are considered specialty parts also serve a replacement function.For such parts, the OEM dealership generally should be able to determineif the replacement features of the specialty part are performing adequately.Diagnosis of problems due to parts other than the specialty part shouldfurther allow the repair facility to assess whether the specialty partis significantly contributing to the emissions noncompliance. Additionally,EPA expects that major suppliers of specialty equipment will make diagnosisand repair information available to repair facilities. Finally, manufacturerscan verify their diagnosis by removing the specialty equipment and returningthe vehicle to its OEM configuration. EPA recognizes that this could berelatively expensive and would expect repair facilities only to take thisaction when it is quite likely that the specialty part is at fault. Specialty parts certified according to the rules being promulgated todaywill have demonstrated their emission control capability. EPA expects warrantyclaims due to certified specialty parts to occur no more frequently thanfor any other certified part. Thus, specialty part warranty claims shouldbe relatively rare. Given the difficulty, complexity and potential confusionassociated with trying to implement a separate warranty system for specialtyparts and the expected infrequent occurrences of certified specialty partwarranty claims, EPA cannot justify a separate specialty part warrantysystem. Thus, for all of the above reasons, these final rules clarify thatwarranty claims involving certified specialty parts will be handled inthe same way as all other claims involving certified parts as suggestedby certain commenters. However, EPA may reconsider the proposed optionif the need arises in the future. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Certification Emissions Test Requirements </ITAG>a. <T3>Certification using ECP's. </T3>As noted earlier, today's final rulesdo not change the regulations currently allowing certification using ECP's(emission critical parameters). Specifically, today's rules do not addor delete any part categories that are eligible to certify using ECP's.Several commenters expressed an interest in expanding the ECP parts list.EPA believes the approach of using ECP's is a sound one, as well as themost straightforward procedure for certifying parts in cases where it ispossible to develop ECP's. EPA encourages industry initiatives to developadditional categories of ECP's for the certification of aftermarket parts.It is one approach that meets the needs of a part manufacturer to certifyat reasonable cost and gives reasonable assurance that the specific partwill work properly for its useful life. Any expansion of the ECP list will require another EPA rulemaking. In themeantime, this final rulemaking also allows all part manufacturers to certifytheir emission related aftermarket parts, whether or not their parts havedefined ECP's, through FTP testing. b. <T3>Certification using the FTP. </T3>As proposed in the NPRM, the regulationsbeing promulgated today permit a part manufacturer to conduct FTP emissiontesting to demonstrate emissions compliance by vehicles using its part.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ However, as discussed later in this notice, in orderto minimize testing expenses for parts manufacturers, EPA is eliminating(or reducing) durability testing requirements for certain parts. For aftermarket parts determined not to accelerate the deterioration ofother preexisting emission related parts, the actual test procedure willrequire two FTP tests, the first in the test vehicle's original configurationand the second with the aftermarket part installed. To obtain certification,the difference of emissions between the two tests must be less than thesmallest ``certification vehicle emission margin'' of all the OEM enginefamilies on which the part is specified for use by the part manufacturer.``Certification vehicle emission margin'' for a certified engine familymeans the difference between the EPA emission standards and the averageFTP emission test results of that engine family's emission-data vehiclesat the projected full useful life mileage point (full useful life mileagefor light-duty vehicles is presently 50,000 miles and for light-duty trucksis 120,000 miles) obtained by the OE manufacturer during vehicle certification.Aftermarket parts accelerating deterioration of other OEM emission relatedparts ordinarily will require only one test on a worst-case vehicle. Thevehicle with the part installed must be driven for its useful life andthen emission tested to determine compliance with applicable standards.Several commenters indicated that EPA should not allow the part manufacturersto use up the emission margin created by the OEM during vehicle developmentand certification. Vehicle manufacturers commented that this margin isnecessary to allow for production differences and other factors which mightcause an emission increase to be detected during selective enforcementauditing (SEA) \14\<NOTE/> or in-use compliance testing (e.g., recall).\15\<NOTE/> However, in the 1983 court case reviewing the 1980 regulations,\16\<NOTE/> EPA was already challenged on the issue of allowing an increasein emissions during aftermarket parts certification. The Motor VehicleManufacturers Association (MVMA) argued that parts should be certifiedto a ``no increase'' standard. EPA argued that the regulations need onlyrequire that a part not cause a vehicle to exceed emission standards, notthat the part cause no emissions increase. The court upheld EPA's interpretationas being consistent with section 207 of the Act. The statute says nothingabout prohibiting certified parts from causing any increase in emissions.Its only concern is that a vehicle in which parts are installed complywith emission standards. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Under section 206(b) of the Act EPA implements the SEAprogram involving assembly line emission testing to determine whether newmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines conform with applicable emissionsregulations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Under section 207(c) EPA implements what is sometimesreferred to as its recall program. Vehicle manufacturers are required torecall and repair a class of vehicles if EPA determines that a substantialnumber are failing in use during their useful lives even though properlymaintained and used. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>APRA </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 720 F.2d at 142. From an emission perspective, EPA would prefer not to allow any emissionsincrease due to the installation of aftermarket parts. However, in orderto treat part manufacturers with similar equity to vehicle manufacturers,the Agency will not prohibit aftermarket part manufacturers from usingup the certification vehicle emission margin during certification. Vehiclemanufacturers may comply with certification requirements by certifyingat a level equal to or below the emission standards. EPA does not believeit is necessary or equitable to require another set of lower standards(i.e., lower than the vehicle emission standards listed in the regulations)to which the part manufacturer must certify, if the part manufacturer demonstratesthat its part when installed will not cause this original emission standardto be exceeded. Moreover, EPA expects that any potential emission increase due to someaftermarket parts using up some of this certification margin will be small.Additionally, the SEA and in-use compliance programs are unaffected bythis. For the SEA program OEM compliance is based on the performance ofassembly line vehicles equipped with OEM components. For the in-use complianceprogram nonconformity determination will not be based on vehicles withunrepresentative emissions caused by non-OEM parts. Therefore, the vehiclemanufacturer is not in jeopardy of failing emission standards in theseprograms due to the installation of aftermarket parts. Further, this potentiallysmall total emission increase should not result in an appreciable increasein performance warranty emission test failures. The I/M programs currentlyin place have relatively high short test emission standards. Few properlymaintained and functioning vehicles would be expected to fail these shorttest standards due to part certification using up some of the originalcertification vehicle emission margin. Moreover, a certified part manufacturerhas a strong incentive not to certify or produce parts that would use upso much of the vehicle certification margin as to make it likely that avehicle would fail an emission test since the part manufacturer must warrantits parts and reimburse vehicle manufacturers if a certified part causesa vehicle to fail a short test. Thus, the Agency has concluded that itis not necessary to adopt more stringent certification requirements forpart manufacturers and the part manufacturer need only show that its partswill not cause vehicles in which the part is installed to exceed emissionstandards. After the certification process, both part and vehicle manufacturers areresponsible on their own to assure that standards will be met in-use. EPAhas established strong incentives for part and vehicle manufacturers todemonstrate in-use compliance. As discussed above, vehicle manufacturershave to meet SEA and in-use compliance requirements in addition to honoringthe performance warranty, while aftermarket part manufacturers must honorperformance warranties and reimburse vehicle manufacturers for the costof vehicle warranty repair if the certified parts cause emission failures.One vehicle manufacturer expressed concern that emission failure duringin-use compliance (recall) testing under section 207(c) of the Act mayincrease due to provisions of this certification program. The commenterexplained that the vehicle manufacturer should not be forced to recallvehicles which fail to meet standards due to aftermarket part installation.The Agency currently considers the representativeness of each vehicle testedin the recall program. EPA will continue to screen vehicles to ensure thatthe emissions of the vehicles (when tested by EPA) are not made unrepresentativeby the use of non-OEM parts. Nonconformity determinations, as they pertainto vehicle manufacturers, will not be based on vehicles with unrepresentativeemissions caused by non-OEM parts. One commenter stated that EPA should account for the effect of multipleparts on emissions. The commenter theorizes that interaction of severalaftermarket parts may cause emissions to increase beyond that normallyexpected by simply accounting for the emissions increase of each individualcomponent. The commenter believes that the part certification test proceduremay not adequately account for this possible effect and that in-use vehiclesequipped with multiple parts may exceed standards.EPA does not expect a significant air quality impact from multiple aftermarketpart usage. Since most OEM parts are designed to be durable for the fulluseful life of the vehicle, EPA expects few of these parts to be replacedbefore 50,000 miles in use. Multiple failures of OEM parts are even moreunlikely. Furthermore, the court of appeals has already addressed a concernraised by the MVMA on the potential effect of multiple aftermarket partson in-use emissions.\17\<NOTE/> <T3>APRA</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3> considered parts certified using ECP'S. MVMA argued that severalcertified parts, each of which only cause some increase in emissions, togethermight result in a failure (during I/M testing). However, the court statedthat such a result is entirely speculative and not a basis for overturningthe rules. EPA believes the same reasoning applies to this rulemaking.Since the possibility of a multiple component failure is likely small andthere is no currently available evidence that such failures are occurringin use, EPA has no basis on which to revise the regulations to accommodatethis issue at this time. If evidence becomes available at some later dateconfirming a problem with failures caused by multiple aftermarket partusage, EPA will readdress this issue at that time.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Ibid. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Denying Use of Short Tests for Aftermarket Parts Certification</ITAG>Aftermarket part manufacturers continue to prefer the use of short testsrather than the FTP as a basis for certification of parts, pointing outthat short tests are less expensive to conduct than the FTP. Allowing shorttest use in certification would reduce certification costs compared toa program relying on FTP test results. The aftermarket part manufacturersalso commented that section 207(b) emission performance warranty claimsonly result from failure of EPA approved short tests, not the FTP. Therefore,they contend, it is only necessary that the manufacturer demonstrate compliancewith the short tests, not with the FTP. In <T3>SEMA</T3> v. <T3>Ruckelshaus,</T3> the court stated that section 207(a)(2) of the Actneither prevents use of the short test for parts certification purposes,nor does it require EPA to use short tests as a basis for certification.The court went on to say that there may be valid policy reasons for rejectingshort tests\18\<NOTE/> and directed EPA to better explain its rationale before doingso.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>SEMA</T3> v. <T3>Ruckelshaus,</T3> 720 F.2d at 136-137, 141.  In the NPRM, EPA presented its reasons for proposing to prohibit use ofa short test for certification from both a policy and technical perspective.Several commenters still argued for the use of alternative short testsfor certification of aftermarket parts. To effectively analyze the suitabilityof various types of short tests for aftermarket part certification, thissection is divided into three groupings: (a) The existing I/M short testscurrently listed in the federal regulations; (b) the alternative non-FTPtests not listed in the federal regulations but considered in the preambleof the NPRM; and (c) the cold 505 (Bag 1) portion of the FTP test, a shorttest not specifically considered in the NPRM but recommended in the comments.a. <T3>Existing I/M short tests.</T3> These final rules do not adopt any existingI/M short test for certification under this program. EPA does not believethat I/M short tests, standing alone, are adequate for certification purposes.EPA does not accept the argument made  by  part  manufacturers  that  the I/M short test must be used for certification because it is the only basisfor determining performance warranty claims. Congress has empowered EPAto ensure that vehicles meet all applicable emission standards for theirstatutory useful life. EPA does not believe it can satisfy this purposewith the I/M short test alone and, as a policy matter EPA does not believeit would be appropriate to attempt to do so.To carry out Congress' intent, EPA has published regulations that spellout the manufacturer's certification and in-use compliance responsibilities,which at times exceed performance warranty responsibilities. For example,while many original vehicle parts have performance warranty coverage foronly 2 years or 24,000 miles, EPA has determined that some of these partsare either too critical to emission performance, or not sufficiently likelyto be serviced in use, to allow manufacturers to replace the part at intervalsas low as 24,000 miles during certification vehicle mileage accumulation.In 40 CFR 86.088-25, EPA established minimum emission part change intervalsrequired during certification vehicle durability demonstration that gobeyond the performance warranty requirements. In many cases, while a vehiclemanufacturer may only warrant a certain part (e.g., ignition wires, emission-relatedhoses and tubes) for 2 years or 24,000 miles under the performance warranty,that same part would be covered under the 207(a) defect warranty up to5 years or 50,000 miles, and that manufacturer may not be allowed to changethat same part on the durability test vehicle for the entire certificationmileage accumulation cycle (50,000 miles for LDV's). Thus, EPA believesit would be inappropriate and inequitable to allow certified aftermarketparts to meet only section 207(b) short test requirements while the OEMparts they are intended to replace are subject to a 5 year/50,000 miledefect warranty, and often must demonstrate compliance under the much morestringent FTP test, including full useful life durability requirements.Moreover, from a more technical perspective, EPA does not believe it shouldadopt the I/M short tests for part certification. Existing I/M short testswere not designed to predict accurately in every case actual vehicle oremission part performance under the wide range of operating conditionstypically encountered in use. I/M short tests are used to screen, in ashort time period, large numbers of vehicles that have already passed certificationand assembly line testing requirements using the full FTP and to identifyvehicles with atypically high emissions which need maintenance or repair.Working within these severe constraints, the short test is designed specificallyto be a screening tool; it is not a predicting tool. Faced with technical and practical implementation constraints (discussedat length in the NPRM and the Summary and Analysis of Comments to thisrulemaking), it was appropriate for EPA to optimize the I/M short test'seffectiveness as an in-use inspection screening tool of vehicles that haddemonstrated compliance in certification and SEA, with no intention ofever using the I/M short test for a part's certification demonstration.The optimization was accomplished by minimizing the chances that a vehiclecapable of passing the FTP test would fail the short test (minimize errorsof commission) while at the same time catching vehicles with particularlyhigh emissions which, if repaired, would result in the greatest emissionbenefit per failing vehicle. In particular, this was achieved by settingI/M test standards so that the typical vehicle failing the existing I/Mshort tests and standards would most likely be expected to have FTP emissionlevels above the FTP standards. While this gives the Agency reasonableconfidence that the I/M tests will catch particularly high emitters thatwould fail the FTP and will not inappropriately fail many vehicles, theexisting I/M short tests do not accurately identify every vehicle whichwould meet the Federal FTP emission standards and every vehicle which wouldfail to meet those standards. The discussion above outlines the effectiveness of current short testsin screening many vehicles to identify potential FTP failures, and appropriatelyproviding warranty repair for some high emitters in the current populationof in-use vehicles. EPA believes that the current I/M short tests are reasonablyeffective and correlate reasonably well with the FTP for these purposeslargely because the vehicles being tested in-use were certified and producedto pass the FTP standards. EPA's elaborate preproduction certificationand end of production line programs are in place to continually verifyFTP compliance of vehicles as produced. Since certified vehicle designshave passed the FTP, and assembly line vehicles have passed or are subjectto FTP testing in the SEA process, EPA is reasonably confident that mostproperly maintained vehicles in-use will meet FTP emission standards. Under the present system, use of existing short tests serves the purposeof section 207(b) by protecting manufacturers from errors of commission,while sufficiently protecting consumers and the environment by identifyinghigh emitting vehicles and providing an economical means for ensuring repairof those vehicles. However, the present system relies on the fact thatFTP-based certification and selective enforcement auditing help reducethe risk that other vehicles may be exceeding standards in-use. By contrast,EPA has no data on how effective the current short tests would be in flaggingFTP failures, or how well they would ``reasonably correlate'' with theFTP, if vehicle/part designs not certified for FTP compliance were alsoincluded in the in use population. However, EPA expects that the additionof numerous ``new'' vehicle/part designs, not previously certified underthe FTP or subject to any FTP audits, would significantly increase thevariability between emission results that would be obtained under I/M shorttests and that would be expected under the FTP and increase the risk thatmore vehicles passing the short tests would fail the FTP (or vice versa).In determining whether to use short tests to certify aftermarket parts,the close relationship between the effectiveness of the current I/M shorttests and the FTP-tested design of the in-use vehicles is particularlyimportant. As noted earlier, aftermarket part manufacturers argued thatit was only necessary to demonstrate compliance with approved short testssince only these short tests would be used to assess in-use complianceof the part and to initiate a performance warranty claim for which thepart manufacturer would be responsible. Moreover, a vehicle with an aftermarketpart installed is, in effect, a new vehicle/part combination which mayor may not have been designed and produced to pass the FTP. Thus, if thepart manufacturers' comments were adopted, and part certification was permittedbased on existing short tests, EPA would not have confidence that the shorttest results would ``reasonably correlate'' with FTP results, given thenew vehicle/part combination. As discussed above, allowing aftermarket part certification relying upononly the existing short tests for new vehicle/part combinations likelywould decrease the degree of correlation between the I/M short tests andthe FTP. Two undesirable results could occur. First, in-use emissions couldincrease as a result of the short tests passing more vehicle/aftermarketpart combinations that would fail the FTP. Second, the current I/M testscould fail more in-use vehicles which actually would pass FTP standardsand thus increase improper performance warranty claims. It is inappropriatefor EPA to establish an aftermarket certification program which could unnecessarilyburden the current I/M and performance warranty programs with more improperclaims. EPA also believes it is somewhat inequitable to allow aftermarketmanufacturers to meet less vigorous, less effective tests than requiredof OEM's. Finally, while performance warranty (I/M) testing is an important partof EPA's comprehensive strategy for controlling air pollution, it is notthe only component in EPA's compliance program strategy. This testing isnot sufficient or adequate outside the context of the vehicle complianceprogram to ensure emissions compliance. The I/M performance warranty programwas implemented to complement the certification process by efficientlyand economically identifying in-use vehicles with abnormally high emissionsso that they might be specifically emission repaired. It has been EPA'spolicy to use an integrated comprehensive approach to meeting Congress'goals. Certifying aftermarket parts to meet only performance warranty requirementswould be inconsistent with EPA's overall policy approach and would presenta high risk that these parts would not allow vehicles to comply with emissionstandards. For these reasons, EPA continues to reject any of the existing approvedshort tests as the basis for aftermarket part certification. b. <T3>Alternative short tests considered in the NPRM.</T3> Since the courtruling, EPA has investigated several alternative short tests and discussedthem at length in the NPRM. These tests have an advantage over currentlyimplemented I/M short tests in that they, like the FTP, may be loaded testsand may measure NO<T2>X</T2> emissions as well as HC and CO. However, in comparison to directlyutilizing the FTP, these tests remain at a disadvantage because there isno data that show how well these tests correlate with the FTP. Furthermore,no standards have been established by EPA that can be used with these teststo determine compliance with Clean Air Act (CAA) emission standards. Moreover,these tests have not been reviewed by the technical community at largefor their acceptability. EPA has not changed its position that the alternative tests consideredin the NPRM should not be adopted in these final rules. EPA did not receivecomments which specifically addressed the first three alternatives discussedin the NPRM. Thus, for reasons discussed in the NPRM and its accompanyingissue paper,\19\<NOTE/> those tests are not adopted in these final rules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ See the Public Docket andplusmin;EN-84-08, category II-B-6.The other two alternative procedures discussed in the NPRM were proceduresproposed by SEMA.\20\<NOTE/> In each case, SEMA proposed a multi-tier approach to certificationtesting. Each tier attempted to match the level of certification demonstrationstringency to the uncertainty of the part's ability to perform properly.The tiers ranged from accepting engineering judgment to FTP testing a vehiclewith and without the candidate aftermarket part installed as adequate demonstrationof a part's performance. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ See the NPRM and the issue paper, docket number EN-84-08,category II-B-6 for a detailed explanation. SEMA commented that their proposals were not adequately reviewed by EPAin the NPRM. EPA does not agree. In the NPRM and supporting issue paperEPA pointed out a number of areas where further development of the demonstrationcriteria required to carry out SEMA's proposals was necessary before theseapproaches would be justified. EPA did not receive comments from any party,including SEMA, that addressed the development of the necessary screeningcriteria. Therefore, for the reasons discussed in the NPRM and the issuepaper, EPA concludes that there is no adequate basis for adopting the SEMAproposals. Should new information be submitted which supports the SEMAproposed procedures, EPA may consider reevaluation of those options atthat time.c. <T3>Proposed cold 505 portion of the FTP as a short test. </T3>During thecomment period on the NPRM, SEMA suggested an alternative short test thatconsisted of using the bag 1 (cold 505) portion of the FTP in lieu of usingthe entire FTP for certification emissions testing. SEMA submitted a CaliforniaAir Resources Board (CARB) analysis involving regressions between cold505 (bag 1) and corresponding FTP (all 3 bags) gram/mile emission resultsfrom in-use vehicles in CARB's database. According to SEMA, the CARB analysessuggested that the cold 505 emission results could possibly be used todemonstrate compliance by ``either meeting an appropriate emission standardor by showing no increase in emissions.''\21\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Docket andplusmin;EN-84-08, Category IV-D-4, SEMA's Comments.The cold 505 emissions test procedure was not considered in the NPRM andlargely for this reason is not being adopted with this final rulemaking.However, in response to SEMA's suggestion, EPA has analyzed the technicalmerits of this alternative short test. EPA believes the bag 1 portion ofthe FTP can be used to reasonably screen parts for compliance with thefull FTP standard. First, this alternative test is a loaded, transienttest, overcoming critical shortcomings of a number of the tests consideredin the NPRM. Secondly, this   alternative reflects the impact on emissionsduring start up and cold transient performance, two operating conditionsnot evaluated in any of the other short tests considered. What is lacking,however, is an appropriate standard for the cold 505 test which can beused to reasonably assure that vehicles meeting such a cold 505 test standardwith an aftermarket part installed would also be expected to meet FTP standards.An evaluation of the cold 505 short test alternative and possible cold505 values that correspond to FTP standards are included in the docketto this rulemaking in a report entitled, ``Using the Cold 505 EmissionTest Procedure for Certification of Aftermarket Parts''.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Docket andplusmin;EN-84-08, Category IV_A. Public comment on this new alternative test procedure and the appropriatestandard is necessary. Consequently, elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is proposing use of the cold 505 portionof the FTP as an alternative to FTP testing for the certification of aftermarketparts. EPA will take final action on this alternative test procedure basedon comments to that proposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Durability Requirements </ITAG>These final rules promulgate the durability demonstration  requirementsfor aftermarket parts proposed in the NPRM.\23\<NOTE/> To certify an aftermarket part, the part manufacturer mustprove its part will operate properly (i.e., not cause emission failure,unacceptable driveability or safety problems)\24\<NOTE/> for the remainder of the warranted useful life of the vehicleon which the part is installed. These final rules are adopting the samedurability (part useful life) requirements for aftermarket parts as arerequired under vehicle certification for original equipment parts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ These requirements address deterioration due to mileageaccumulation, but arguably do not reflect deterioration caused by salt,moisture, dirt, and other phenomenon that age a part or system over time.While EPA does not explicitly require material and workmanship specificationsin these regulation revisions, it is EPA's intention that the part manufacturerwill consider aging effects in its designs. EPA will monitor the materialand structural specifications of parts and, if the Agency determines thereis a high risk that parts will not withstand aging effects for the requireduseful life, EPA may revise these regulations to address this issue. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The Act, section 202(a)(4), states EPA's responsibilityfor not allowing use of devices or emission designs where the ``* * * devicesystem or element of design will cause or contribute to an unreasonablerisk to public health or safety in its operation or function.'' EPA has established what the Agency considers to be the minimum aftermarketpart durability demonstration requirements necessary to assure the continuedsatisfactory emission performance of vehicles on which the certified partsare installed. EPA has selected these procedures in order to   minimizethe cost of durability testing. In those cases where durability testingis required, EPA does recognize that the cost of demonstration may be adisincentive to certification (see section F). However, continued satisfactoryemission performance over the expected life of the part is necessary. Currentlythe Agency does not know of an alternative scheme which would be applicableto a wide range of aftermarket parts and yet provide sufficient assuranceof aftermarket part emission performance durability. To establish a program that gives reasonable compliance assurance at areasonable cost, EPA has categorized parts by the minimal level of durabilitydemonstration necessary to maintain sufficient confidence that the partwill not contribute to excess in-use emissions. For these final rules discussion,the categories fall under those parts requiring no testing and those partsrequiring testing. A summary of the program durability requirements, andthe decision process involved to determine when these requirements applyto a specific part to be certified, is shown in Attachment I.a. <T3>Parts requiring no durability testing. </T3>These regulations willallow a durability exemption for certification of any emission relatedparts that upon failure normally cause a noticeable vehicle driveabilityperformance, and/or fuel economy change of the vehicle at a level detectableby the driver and likely to result in near term repair. Even parts designedprimarily for emission control will be considered for durability exemptionif failure of these parts will normally result in noticeable driveabilityproblems.\25\<NOTE/> Due to the driveability problems, early maintenance of suchmalfunctioning parts will likely occur. Thus, since in-use emission problemscaused by malfunction of these parts should be short term, parts properlyassigned to this category will be allowed a durability exemption. Onlyparts that during normal part operation, are determined to accelerate theemission deterioration of existing components will be required to performdurability demonstration as described in the next section (part 5b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Two commenters (MEMA and SEMA) were uncertain as to howparts ``designed primarily for emissions control'' that cause driveabilityproblems would be categorized. This clarification in these final rulesshow that such parts will be considered for durability exemption. The regulations (at 40 CFR 85.2114) require the manufacturer to submitwith its notification a document which provides adequate demonstrationthat the part will be replaced at failure due to poor driveability, poorperformance and/or poor fuel economy. It is the responsibility of the partmanufacturer to demonstrate that failure of the part would result in vehiclerepair, and thereby, be exempt from any durability demonstration. The typeof conditions that must be satisfied for durability exemption are morefully discussed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments. b. <T3>Parts requiring durability testing</T3>_i. <T3>Parts demonstrated to cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveabilitywhen the part fails. </T3>These regulations require that an aftermarketpart manufacturer, certifying a part that is appropriately categorizedas those emission related parts that do not normally cause noticeable driveabilitychange when their emission performance deteriorates or fails, must demonstratethe part's durability by aging it over an accepted durability cycle onan appropriate durability vehicle. EPA cannot be sure that failure of theseparts, and the resulting vehicle emission noncompliance, would be detectedand repaired in a timely manner. Thus, these parts must be shown to bedurable for their full useful lives. These regulations state that part aging for these shall be conducted bydriving the durability vehicle with the part installed for the part's usefullife over the durability cycle specified in 40 CFR part 86, appendix IV.The manufacturer may use an alternative durability cycle if it determinesthat the alternative cycle is at least as representative of typical in-useoperation as the cycle described in appendix IV. However, in some cases,test data from a durability vehicle run specifically for certificationpurposes will not be required if the manufacturer submits other data collectedfor other purposes, (e.g., for design reliability purposes) that is sufficientto demonstrate the durability of a part (i.e., if the manufacturer determinesthat the operating cycle and other factors potentially affecting the dataare typically representative of what would occur for in-use vehicles).For parts that during normal part operation would not be expected to causeaccelerated deterioration (compared to OEM counterparts) of other existingemission related components, it is not necessary that the vehicle usedfor durability aging also be used for demonstrating certification emissioncompliance. The aftermarket part manufacturer may choose to demonstratecertification emission compliance of the aged part on another test vehicleif for some reason the manufacturer determines the durability vehicle isnot suitable for emission testing. Only parts that during normal part operation are determined to acceleratethe emission deterioration of existing emission related components willbe required to perform more stringent durability demonstration as describedin the next paragraph. ii. <T3>Parts that accelerate deterioration of existing emission related parts.</T3>EPA expects that manufacturers will be able to determine that thegreat majority of their parts will not accelerate deterioration of otherexisting emission related components. EPA expects aftermarket parts thatmainly perform the same function as an OEM component, or even a consolidatedfunction, can be determined by the aftermarket part manufacturer not toaccelerate deterioration of other existing emission related componentscompared to OEM parts. However, in the case where an aftermarket part mightcause emission deterioration of existing emission related parts beyondthat expected if only OEM parts were present, both the part's deteriorationand the degradation to the rest of the emission related components mustbe evaluated. For these parts, an appropriate durability vehicle (see Section E of thispreamble) must be aged for the vehicle's full useful life with the aftermarketpart installed. At the time of certification, the same durability vehicleis emission tested with the aged part installed. Since both vehicle andpart are aged, a part passes certification if the FTP emission resultsof the fully aged vehicle with the aged part installed do not exceed theapplicable FTP standards.One commenter (APAA) asked for an example of ``the accelerated deteriorationto other emission related components of the vehicle.'' A detailed exampleis presented in the Summary and Analysis of Comments. One vehicle manufacturer (Ford) expressed its concern that when a partand vehicle are aged and tested together, as required for parts that acceleratedeterioration of other parts, a part that is a maintenance part with ascheduled replacement interval of less than 50,000 miles could be replacedduring certification mileage accumulation. If the part is replaced, thelast installed part may not be aged to its full warranted mileage at thetime of certification testing. In such a case, the emission impact of afully deteriorated part will not be evaluated. EPA agrees with this comment.Therefore, EPA will require that the installed part be aged to at leastthe recommended replacement mileage prior to certification testing. Thismay require the reinstallation of a replaced part used during durabilitymileage accumulation that is aged for the minimum recommended mileage.A full discussion is given in the Summary and Analysis of Comments. c. <T3>Light-Duty Truck (LDT) part durability. </T3>To demonstrate LDT partdurability for 120,000 miles (the useful life for LDT's), EPA proposedin the NPRM that for a LDT part manufacturer required to perform durabilitytesting, the manufacturer would have to accumulate not more than 50,000vehicle miles on the part and then project FTP emission results from theworst case test vehicle with the aged part installed out to the 120,000mile useful life point. Ford expressed concern with the method proposed in the NPRM for projectingLDT emission results, commenting that it would be difficult for a partmanufacturer to predict aftermarket part impact on truck emission deteriorationfrom 50,000 to 120,000 miles without intimate knowledge of the rest ofthe truck. EPA agrees that Ford's comment has some merit and understandsthe technical difficulty of the proposal. Thus, EPA has reviewed the completeproposed method of certifying these LDT parts for consistency and easeof implementation relative to the entire part certification program. Basedon that review, it has been determined that the LDT certification processas proposed can be clarified in such a way that, while maintaining a reasonabledemonstration requirement, it will be more consistent with LDV demonstrationand in most cases rely on actual test data rather than extrapolated deteriorationestimates. For LDT parts that are exempt from durability testing (i.e., parts demonstratedto cause a noticeable change in vehicle driveability when the part fails,but also have no deteriorative affect on existing emission related components),two FTP tests will be performed on the worst case test vehicle, one testbefore and one test after the part is installed. As in the case of comparableLDV parts, the difference in emissions between the two tests must be lessthan the certification vehicle emission margin at the full useful lifemileage point. The situation is a little different for parts requiring durability evaluation.It is expected that most LDT aftermarket parts will not be installed onvehicles for anything near the full 120,000 mile useful life of the truck.Therefore, EPA will retain the 50,000 mile durability mileage accumulationdemonstration requirement as proposed for those parts that require durabilitytesting. If the part manufacturer has determined that full durability demonstrationis more appropriate for its LDT part, the manufacturer has the option ofaccumulating 120,000 miles on its part and then testing for emission performancerather than using 50,000 mile emission test results. For LDT parts demonstrated to cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveabilitywhen the part fails, and also have no deteriorative effect on existingemission related components or systems, the part does not have to be agedon the same test vehicle used for emission testing. After the part is agedfor 50,000 miles, the selected worst case emission test vehicle is FTPtested once before and once after the aged part is installed. As in thecase of comparable LDV parts, the difference in emissions between the twotests must be less than the certification vehicle emission margin at 120,000miles as determined using deterioration factors (d.f.'s) during the vehiclecertification process. (Note that the certification vehicle emission marginis determined at 50,000 miles for LDVs but at 120,000 miles for LDTs. However,50,000 miles for LDVs approximates half of the full life expected for LDVs,whereas 120,000 estimates the full useful life for LDTs. Thus, aging aftermarketparts to 50,000 for both classes of vehicles reasonably evaluates the aftermarketparts for about half the full useful life of the vehicles on which theyare installed.) For only those LDT parts that are categorized as parts that cause accelerateddeterioration to existing emission related parts or systems, EPA requiresthat the part be aged on the same test vehicle that will be used for emissiontesting. An FTP test must be performed at 4,000 miles and at 50,000 miles(other FTP tests may be performed at interim mileages at the option ofthe manufacturer). Deterioration factors (d.f.'s) for the test vehiclewith the part installed will be calculated from these two test results,or from all test results when multiple FTP tests are run, using linearregression. The LDT d.f.'s will be used to linearly project the 50,000mile test result out to 120,000 miles. EPA has observed that original vehiclemanufacturers never project LDT deterioration at greater than a linearrate. Therefore, the regulations require linear d.f. projections as representativeof expected emission deterioration for these parts. The projected 120,000mile test results must meet LDT emission standards.\26\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ For those LDT part manufacturers that choose to run afull 120,000 miles of durability demonstration, the actual FTP test atthe 120,000 mile point must pass the FTP standards. The one test is thensufficient for certification and no other FTP tests or emission projectionsare necessary. Aside from requiring projections to 120,000 miles, this method of demonstrationis basically the same as the requirements for LDV parts that have similareffects on existing emission related parts. The added burden of one extraFTP test at 4,000 miles is necessary to enable the part manufacturer toreasonably project its results out to 120,000 miles, thus avoiding theburden of actually accumulating mileage on the test vehicle out to 120,000miles. As in the case of LDV parts with comparable effects on existingemission related parts, EPA again believes that few LDT aftermarket partswill be certified in this category (see discussion in section III.A.5.b).d. <T3>Evaporative emission control system durability.</T3> EPA is adoptingthe evaporative system durability requirements proposed in the NPRM. Nocomments were received on this proposal. For aftermarket parts which themanufacturer determines should only affect evaporative emission performance,the durability requirements of the regulations are similar to those inplace for vehicle evaporative certification. The regulations require theaftermarket part manufacturer to determine and document the appropriatemethodology for durability evaluation of its evaporative emission controlsystem parts and their synergistic deteriorative effect on OEM evaporativeemission components. As specified in the current regulations (andSection;85.2114(d)), compliance with the evaporative emission standards would bedetermined after completing durability evaluation by performing the evaporativeemission portion of the FTP on the vehicle with the part installed. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Test Vehicle Selection </ITAG>The proposed regulations would have required that certification emissiontesting be performed on a single worst case test vehicle selected by theaftermarket part manufacturer for each part design it is certifying. Onepart manufacturer association (SEMA) was concerned that its members wouldhave to perform extensive analyses to determine a single worst-case configurationfor certification testing. It proposed that EPA define narrow selectioncriteria that would specifically identify two test vehicle applicationsand reasonably assure worst case demonstration. SEMA suggested specificcriteria for the two alternative test vehicles but stated that EPA maydetermine other, more acceptable criteria. These final rules adopt the EPA proposed method of vehicle selection and,as requested by the comments, offer an alternative, optional, two vehiclemethod for test vehicle selection. The first method, as proposed, requiresthe aftermarket part manufacturer to select that vehicle application expectedto have the largest increase in emission levels due to the installationof the part to be certified. For part manufacturers capable of making thisdetermination, this selection method is potentially the least costly methodsince only one test vehicle and set of emission tests are needed to certify.The alternative method requires selection of two test vehicles. The firsttest vehicle is selected from the certified vehicle configurations representingthe largest projected sales volumes of the part. Within this group of certifiedvehicles, the manufacturer shall select the heaviest equivalent test weightfrom the set of test vehicles originally used to demonstrate vehicle certification.Within the group of vehicles of that weight, the manufacturer shall selectthe design which corresponds to the vehicle certification emission datavehicle which has the largest engine displacement. The second test vehicle is required to come from a different vehicle manufacturerthan the first vehicle; if the part is intended for installation on onlya single manufacturer's product line, then the second test vehicle is tobe selected from a different engine family. Within this set of vehicles,the same criteria as used to select the first test vehicle are used toselect the second test vehicle. The test vehicle selected will correspondto the certification emission data vehicle with the highest equivalenttest weight for all possible applications of the part. Within this group,the largest engine displacement shall be selected. If a part applies toonly one engine family then only the first worst case vehicle is requiredto certify. While slightly different from SEMA's specific proposal, these selectioncriteria are consistent with those recommended by SEMA.\27\<NOTE/> Most importantly, these  criteria satisfy SEMA's goal ofproviding objective criteria for test vehicle selection. For part manufacturersthat cannot determine their own worst case vehicle selection, the alternativemethod is a reasonable choice. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Although SEMA recommended inertia weight instead of equivalenttest weight as a criteria, equivalent test weight is a more appropriatecriterion for selecting a unique test vehicle. As a subset of inertia weight,equivalent test weight more accurately defines the actual weight of thevehicle and is the simulated weight at which it is emission tested on thechassis dynamometer. Information on vehicle certification emission data vehicles is convenientlyavailable to the public through the annual ``Federal Certification TestResult List.'' From this list the aftermarket part manufacturer can selectthe test vehicles according to the criteria above. Carline designationneed not be identical between the vehicle certification emission data vehicleand the aftermarket part certification test vehicle. The only requirementsare that the test vehicle has the same equivalent test weight and enginedisplacement and be from the same engine family as determined by the specificcriteria. If the certification test car list contains more than one emissiondata vehicle satisfying the criteria for an aftermarket part test vehicleselection, then the manufacturer may select any one of the eligible designs.The regulations require the aftermarket part certification test vehicleor vehicles selected to be serviced to ensure all parts function properlybefore testing. All excessively worn or malfunctioning emission componentsshould be repaired or replaced before testing. If durability demonstration is necessary, EPA is adopting the NPRM proposalthat the part manufacturer select the durability vehicle expected to causethe greatest deterioration in the performance characteristics of the partthat influence emissions. EPA is also adopting an alternative selectioncriteria for durability test vehicles proposed by SEMA during the commentperiod. Manufacturers may choose (as they did when selecting certificationtest vehicles) the vehicle representing the highest equivalent test weightwith the largest engine displacement size of all configurations on whichthe part is meant to be used (the alternative second vehicle selection).Thus, if the manufacturer chooses, a certification test vehicle could beused as the durability vehicle. For durability vehicle selection, onlythe one vehicle is required to reasonably represent the part. On occasion, an aftermarket part manufacturer may determine that more thanone part that it wishes to certify will use the same durability and/oremission test vehicle. The regulations do not prohibit this manufacturerfrom simultaneously installing more than one part on one demonstrationtest vehicle and performing the durability and/or emission test requirement.The part manufacturer could realize a cost benefit by using one test cycleto demonstrate the compliance of more than one part. However, if the manufacturerplans to separately certify and sell each of these jointly tested parts,it must assure EPA, with a technical rationale, that each component, iftested separately, would not cause the vehicle to exceed emission standards.One vehicle manufacturer (Ford) suggested that the worst case test vehiclerequirement for part certification be the same as the worst case selectioncriteria for vehicle certification. Vehicle manufacturers must select aworst-case vehicle for each engine family certified each model year. Asproposed, an aftermarket part manufacturer could certify a part for useon several engines or across several model years so long as the criticaldesign aspects of the part remained the same and therefore the test datawere relevant. However, EPA does not find it appropriate to require a partmanufacturer to run a test vehicle for every application of a part everymodel year. The sales of a part on each engine family would likely notbe great enough to justify the cost of yearly individual certificationdemonstration. Furthermore, just as in the case of vehicle manufacturers,part manufacturers often have specific components which are installed onmany engine families and are expected to perform identically on each enginefamily. Since one aftermarket part design can cover several families, models,and model years, a single set of test data can appropriately apply acrossthese families, models, and model years. Therefore, Ford's suggestion isnot adopted. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Parts that Affect the Vehicle's Onboard Diagnostic System </ITAG>EPA proposed that no manufacturer may certify a part that would alter orrender ineffective the onboard diagnostic system of any vehicle on whichit is installed. Only if a part integrates properly with the existing diagnosticsystem can it be certified. These provisions involving vehicle diagnosticsystems received no comments, and are adopted as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Notification of Intent to Certify </ITAG>The regulations currently require that a notification of intent to certifya part be sent to EPA by the part manufacturer at least 45 days prior tothe proposed date of sale of the part as certified. The Agency may usethis period to review the notification for adequacy and notify a part manufacturerof potential problems, if necessary. For part manufacturers who have not developed a format for their notification,EPA will make available upon request a recommended generic format. Itsuse is optional. For convenience, EPA will place all notifications received in a publicinformation file in the EPA headquarters library so that any party, includingvehicle manufacturers, interested in reviewing the notification can doso. However, EPA will treat material which the part manufacturer has clearlyidentified as proprietary or confidential in a manner that complies withAgency confidentiality regulations. B. Reimbursement and Dispute Resolution Procedure In these final rules, as was proposed in the NPRM, EPA has provided a forumin which vehicle manufacturers and certified aftermarket part manufacturerscan resolve cost reimbursement disputes that arise with regard to a performancewarranty claim involving a certified aftermarket part. EPA prefers thatdisputes that arise between vehicle and part manufacturers be resolvedinformally. Therefore, provisions are made in this rulemaking to requirediscussion between involved parties before a more formal dispute mechanismis pursued. As was proposed in the NPRM, disputes which cannot be resolved informallywill be decided through arbitration. Either party may then resort to acourt of competent jurisdiction as provided by law. The NPRM provisionsprovided guidelines for arbitration based generally on the comprehensivearbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (the AAA). Inthe NPRM, EPA expressed its belief that it was necessary to leave somelatitude to resolve individual warranty disputes on a case-by-case basis.Comments received from vehicle manufacturers, however, indicated that additionalguidance as to the specifics of the arbitration process was required. Based on these comments, EPA has decided in these final rules to specifythe exact arbitration framework it contemplated in the NPRM by explicitlyadopting the AAA arbitration mechanism with certain changes. Consequently,disputes which cannot be resolved informally will be decided by means ofarbitration rules based on Commercial Arbitration Rules, published by theAAA, revised and in effect as of September 1, 1988.As a precondition to certification, part manufacturers must agree to arbitrationshould an otherwise unresolvable reimbursement dispute occur over the useof a certified aftermarket part. To initiate the arbitration procedure,the involved parties may select arbitrators pursuant to the steps presentedin this rulemaking. The regulations provide that if a part manufacturer refuses to go to arbitrationafter attempts at independent settlement have failed to resolve the dispute,that party is treated as if it loses the arbitration and is liable to payall ``reasonable expenses'' (reasonable expenses are those defined in thefollowing section) billed by the vehicle manufacturer. If a vehicle manufacturer refuses to participate in arbitration concerninga specific claim, that manufacturer is treated as if it loses the arbitration.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reimbursement Definitions </ITAG>Under existing regulations a vehicle manufacturer must honor a consumeremission performance warranty claim during the time frames provided byClean Air Act section 207(b), provided the vehicle has been properly usedand maintained, whether the failure is caused by OEM parts or certifiedaftermarket parts. The vehicle manufacturer is entitled to reimbursementfrom the certified part manufacturer for ``reasonable expenses'' incurredin the repair of a vehicle if a ``valid emission performance warranty claim''arose because of the use of the certified aftermarket part. Prior to this rulemaking, vehicle and part manufacturers contended thatthe terms ``reasonable expense'' and ``valid emission performance warrantyclaim'' used in the existing regulations were too vague to provide meaningfulguidance to part manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers. In <T3>SEMA </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>720 F.2d at 139-40, the court required that EPA eitherapply its expertise in the area and define terms, or provide a forum inwhich the terms would be clarified through an adversarial process suchas arbitration. Today's rulemaking does both. These final rules clarifyand broaden the definition for ``reasonable expense'' and require the OEMor the aftermarket part manufacturer to retain replaced parts prior tothe resolution of a ``valid emission performance warranty claim.'' It alsoestablishes a step-by-step dispute resolution process that requires specificactions and imposes deadlines to resolve claim disputes leading into thearbitration process. The arbitration process provides a forum for furtherclarification of the meaning of these terms on a case-by-case basis. a. <T3>Reasonable expenses. </T3>In the NPRM, EPA proposed to define ``reasonableexpense'' to include any expense categories that would be considered payableby the vehicle manufacturer to its authorized dealer under similar conditionswhere an OEM part was determined to be the cause of the failure. EPA furtherstated that these expenses might include but are not limited to cost oflabor, materials, recordkeeping, and billing. EPA also pointed out thatany additional necessary clarification would occur during the dispute resolutionprocess. Vehicle manufacturers commented that the proposed definition of ``reasonableexpense'' was too limited and should be further defined and expanded. Theyrecommended a number of additional expense categories unique to processingclaims involving aftermarket parts. Manufacturers were looking for a meansof reimbursement of those costs beyond normal dealer-related costs. Furthermore,vehicle manufacturers recommended that the ultimate scope and specificsof the term should not be left to the dispute resolution process for clarification.In this rulemaking, EPA has determined that reimbursement for some butnot all of these additional expense categories suggested by vehicle manufacturersis reasonable and should be allowed. While EPA recognizes the vehicle manufacturers'concern about resolving the definition and has taken steps to broaden expensecategories where appropriate, the Agency also realizes that unforeseenissues may surface and will have to be dealt with on a case by case basisduring the resulting dispute resolution process. In order to provide an equitably defined expense category for both vehicleand part manufacturers, the regulations provide the following structurefor determining reimbursable costs. i. Reasonable expenses will include normal warranty costs reimbursablefrom the vehicle manufacturers to their dealers, as proposed, plus additionalvehicle manufacturer costs unique to processing claims involving non-originalequipment parts, as suggested by commenters. However, all charges beyondactual parts and labor repair expenses must be amortized over the numberof valid claims and/or a number of years in a manner consistent with generallyaccepted accounting principles. Moreover, storage costs are not reimbursable.ii. The vehicle manufacturer, who has extensive experience with the evaluationof warranty claims from the dealer network for OEM parts, should make anevaluation of what is deemed reasonable and submit an itemized bill tothe part manufacturer. The part manufacturer has the right to dispute anyportion of the billing that it deems unreasonable through the dispute resolutionprocedure. iii. Storage costs related to retention of a certified aftermarket partinvolved in a performance warranty claim are not reimbursable. Parts mustbe retained until the claim has been resolved. The vehicle manufacturerproviding the repair may, in lieu of storing the parts, transfer the partsto the applicable part manufacturer for storage. The part manufactureris only required to retain the parts related to those claims it intendsto contest. While storage costs are not reimbursable, the cost to the vehiclemanufacturer of shipping the part may be added to the reasonable expenseof a valid warranty claim. b. <T3>Valid emission warranty claim. </T3>As was proposed, these final rulesdefine a ``valid emission performance warranty claim'' on a vehicle asa claim for which (1) there is no evidence that the vehicle was not properlymaintained and operated in accordance with manufacturer instructions ina manner linked to emission failures; (2) the vehicle failed to conformto applicable emission standards as measured by an EPA-approved emissionswarranty test during the useful life of a part related to emission control,and (3) in the case of a test failure, the owner is subject to a sanctionas a result of a test failure. Part manufacturers commented that they should not be required to honora warranty claim allegedly caused by an aftermarket part without sufficientproof that the claim is valid. Part manufacturers said this proof shouldinclude access to the parts replaced. Vehicle manufacturers commented thateither they should be allowed to recover the substantial costs associatedwith retaining the part or part retention should not be required. In thelatter case, some other means of providing proof of a part failure shouldbe established in lieu of providing the actual part to the part manufacturer.Since the parts involved in a warranty claim are likely the most concreteand necessary evidence with which to validate a claim, these final rulesrequire retention of the involved parts until disputes have been resolved.However, EPA will allow the vehicle manufacturer the option to transferthe parts to the part manufacturer for storage. The part manufacturer needonly retain those parts related to the warranty reimbursement claims itchooses to dispute. If the part manufacturer does not receive a bill fromthe vehicle manufacturer within one year of the date of repair of theseparts, the part manufacturer is not required to store the parts beyondone year from the date of repair. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Dispute Resolution Forum </ITAG>a. <T3>Arbitration. </T3>EPA intends that independent settlement between manufacturerswill be the normal mechanism of dispute resolution. However, when disputescannot be resolved through independent negotiation, the involved manufacturersmust follow a structured forum for dispute resolution via arbitration consistentwith the guidelines provided by these final rules. This provides a reasonablemethod for manufacturers to present a case, to further clarify what ``reasonableexpenses'' and ``valid warranty claims'' are, and to receive a quick, impartialdecision. Since EPA expects the arbitrator's award and decision to havedue regard for precedent, arbitration awards and decisions will be maintainedon file at EPA as described in section 4, below. Many commenters requested additional details for the arbitration procedureas presented in the NPRM. The regulations specify the step by step processfrom beginning through arbitration for manufacturers pursuing warrantyclaims involving certified aftermarket parts. The process specified inthe regulations is a revised version of that presented in the proposal.The finally-adopted process provides further guidance and additional detailsregarding scheduling to ensure that a forum exists for resolving disputesprior to judicial involvement. In a general commercial setting, arbitration is binding because the partiesvoluntarily agree to give up their right to immediate judicial recourse.Section 207(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act and the order of the SEMA courtreferred to above, however, provide the authority for establishing arbitrationas a mechanism to resolve warranty disputes. In addition, under section301(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act the Administrator has general regulatoryauthority to prescribe regulations to carry out provisions of the CleanAir Act. A form of arbitration utilizing the AAA was chosen as the dispute resolutionmechanism in this context for three reasons. Firstly, cost reimbursementdisputes are generally commercial matters and do not commonly involve questionsof public policy. They can therefore be resolved independently of the Agencyby an outside entity whose impartial decision is clearly not Agency action.Secondly, the AAA has considerable experience in resolving commercial disputesand has agreed to assist EPA in dealing with any unique problems that mightarise. Thirdly, AAA based arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanismhas been incorporated into regulations promulgated under other environmentalstatutes such as the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (40 CFR 791.20 et seq. and 29 CFR part 1440).The following is a brief summary of the arbitration process adopted today.The vehicle manufacturer is required to submit a bill for reimbursementto the part manufacturer. If the vehicle manufacturer transfers the partto the part manufacturer, the vehicle manufacturer must submit the billwithin one year of the date of repair. Independent discussions betweenthe parties must take place within 60 days after receipt of the warrantyclaim bill. Arbitration may begin before the end of the 60 day period onlyif both parties agree to arbitration. After expiration of the 60 day period,if either party files, then both parties must submit to arbitration. Theparty filing for arbitration must also notify EPA at that time. If theparties by themselves cannot select an arbitrator within 90 days of receiptof the original repair bill, then the arbitrator will be appointed fromthe National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators that is established and maintainedby the AAA. The arbitrator will determine the date, time and place of thehearing. If the aftermarket part manufacturer is ordered by the arbitrator to reimburseall or part of the warranty repair costs, it must do so within 30 daysof an arbitration decision, or, if a court of competent jurisdiction agreeswith the arbitrator's decision, within 30 days of the court's decisionunless the court orders otherwise. EPA believes that this arbitration procedure has a number of advantages.Evidentiary rules are flexible so that less time will be spent arguingabout the propriety and relevance of evidence. The hearings are apt tobe less expensive and less likely to create antagonism between the parties.The flexible process used by the greater discretion of the arbitrator willeasily accommodate the variety of situations in which reimbursement questionswill arise. Many commenters expressed a desire for more detail than was provided inthe arbitration mechanism proposed in the NPRM. They suggested that theindustry be allowed to develop a master arbitration agreement as a meansof providing detail beyond that proposed. Since the arbitration mechanismis described in considerable detail in the final regulations, EPA believesthat it provides the type of guidance for resolving disputes contemplatedby the commenters in requesting a master arbitration agreement. The proceduresspecified in these final rules can be varied only with the agreement ofboth parties.By requiring an arbitration mechanism, EPA is providing a structured forumfor the initial resolution of disputes. However, this does not prohibiteither party from resorting to the judicial system, as provided for bylaw, after the arbitration is concluded. Moreover, the regulations do notpreclude either party from filing a lawsuit in an appropriate court <T3>ab initio </T3>if neither desires to submit the dispute to arbitration.If either party does file for arbitration, however, both parties are boundto follow the arbitration procedure to its conclusion prior to recourseto the courts. b. <T3>EPA Involvement. </T3>Several manufacturers questioned the efficiencyof the dispute resolution program proposed in the NPRM without direct EPAinvolvement. EPA believes that this program will provide a fair, effective,and well structured forum for resolving those disputes (expected to berelatively few) not resolved informally. Moreover, EPA will monitor theeffectiveness of this program, keeping the Agency involved both by manufacturerfeedback and EPA initiated monitoring. Should a need for change becomeapparent, EPA will act accordingly to provide further regulatory interpretationand guidance or revise regulations if necessary. To aid in this monitoringeffort, EPA requires that the Manufacturers Operations Division (MOD) Directorof the Office of Mobile Sources be informed of scheduled arbitration hearingsby the filing party. Should the arbitration panel need specific informationfrom EPA, EPA will be available on a consulting basis.Manufacturers in their comments on the NPRM suggested that EPA participateon an arbitration panel. The apparent reason for suggesting EPA participationis the possibility that EPA could speed up the dispute resolution processbecause of the Agency's knowledge and exposure to certain voluntary aftermarketpart certification program issues. However, the technical expertise required to make an informed arbitrationdetermination is not unique to EPA personnel. An uninvolved outside partycould also provide an adequate determination assuming the party was giventhe appropriate background. The arbitrator, or members of an arbitrationpanel, would be briefed by the involved parties and would be provided withadequate information and evidence on which to base the arbitration decision.Moreover, direct EPA participation would not necessarily expedite the proceeding;in fact it could result in some delay. EPA is compelled to use its limited resources in a manner that will mosteffectively benefit air quality. While EPA recognizes the importance ofdispute resolution, EPA could not maintain a resource bank waiting foran aftermarket dispute to occur. Should an arbitration claim be broughtduring a time when EPA resources were committed to other projects, it couldsubstantially slow up the entire process. Thus, the option of using EPA personnel as arbitrators in resolving disputesis not adopted. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Arbitration Costs and Payments </ITAG>The arbitration costs are set out in the Administrative Fee Schedule ofthe AAA. Unless determined otherwise by the arbitrator, the arbitrationcosts will be allocated as follows. Individual case costs will be borneby the losing party. If the judgment is wholly against the vehicle manufacturer,it would need to pay only the arbitration costs of the decision, sinceit would have already absorbed the original repair costs. If the judgmentis wholly against the aftermarket part manufacturer, it must not only payall arbitration costs, but also reimburse the vehicle manufacturer forthe original repair costs. If the arbitrator does not rule wholly in favorof either party, the parties will share the cost of repair and arbitration.As adopted in today's final rules, the part manufacturer is required tomake payment on a lost arbitration decision or after completion of judicialproceedings, if any, relating to the arbitrator's decision. However, ifthe part manufacturer does not pay for a lost arbitration settlement (includingboth original repair costs and its share of arbitration costs) on a timelybasis, EPA will decertify that part on all vehicle applications for whichit is certified. The aftermarket part manufacturer will then be liablefor all results of decertification specified in 40 CFR 85.2121.  <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Provision for Recurring Disputes </ITAG>In their comments, several motor vehicle manufacturers stated that EPAneeds to provide a mechanism for handling recurring disputes especiallyif there are subsequent claims for a part that has previously been decertifiedor when there is a large number of claims for a particular part which waspreviously determined in arbitration to be defective. Vehicle manufacturersrecommended that once an arbitration panel has determined that an aftermarketpart is the cause of emissions failure, the decision should set a precedentfor future disputes. Therefore, a vehicle manufacturer could obtain automaticreimbursement for recurring warranty claims and avoid the burden of repeatedreimbursement proceedings. EPA is rejecting the commenters' suggestion to include a provision forhandling recurring disputes for the following reasons: First, it is EPA's intent that in subsequent arbitration proceedings, considerationwill be given to previous arbitration decisions which involved the samemanufacturer and specific part. EPA intends and believes that all arbitratorswill treat prior decisions as precedents and give them appropriate deferencewhenever the circumstances justify that. However, a provision allowinga previous decision on the same part to dictate all future decisions (i.e.,automatic payment of a claim by the part manufacturer) denies the partmanufacturer access to arbitration and could potentially impair the rightof the part manufacturer to present evidence as to why, under the specificcircumstances of its case, a prior, decision should not be considered abinding precedent. Similarly, all claims for a part failure may not necessarily be legitimate.The circumstances which made the first claim for a part failure legitimatemay not necessarily apply in the subsequent cases brought to arbitration.Thus, all claims will need to be settled on a case by case basis in orderto determine the validity of each claim. Third, businesses that comprise the aftermarket industry are unlikely towant to go to the expense of rearguing a claim for the same part and circumstanceswhich were involved in a previous claim for which they lost arbitration.Thus, there should be few such cases requiring arbitration. Finally, in the case where a part manufacturer has lost repeated claimsinvolving a particular defective part, EPA may decide to decertify thepart. While this would not affect the part manufacturer's warranty liabilityfor parts already sold as certified parts to consumers, it would stop futureproduction, distribution and sales by the part manufacturer of these partsas certified components. In so doing, it would reduce the number of warrantyclaims involving this aftermarket part over a period of time and correspondinglyreduce the disputes that arise due to the part.While not adopting a provision for handling recurring disputes, EPA willassist in assuring prompt dissemination of arbitration decisions by actingas a clearing house for the results and records of arbitration hearings.The Agency will maintain a file of records submitted by industry, organizedby manufacturer and component as well as a file of arbitration awards anddecisions organized along the same lines. EPA expects the vehicle manufacturerswill voluntarily supply this information since it is to their benefit.Any vehicle and part manufacturer will have reasonable access to this informationupon request. This information may be used by manufacturers during arbitrationhearings involving a repeat failure. Furthermore, this file may act toflag parts showing pattern failures that should be considered for decertification.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Escrow/Bond Requirement </ITAG>In the NPRM, EPA considered but did not propose a requirement for partmanufacturers to demonstrate financial stability by posting bond or escrow.Requiring posting of a bond would violate EPA's intent to make certificationas efficient and inexpensive as possible for part manufacturers. In addition,there is no evidence that suggests that part manufacturers are financiallyunstable. EPA's position is basically the same as it was when the parts certificationregulations were first promulgated in 1980. That position was upheld bythe court in <T3>SEMA</T3> v. <T3>Ruckelshaus,</T3> 720 F.2d at 140. The court in the SEMA case pointedout that one intent of the regulations was to make certification as efficientand inexpensive as possible (while maintaining technical and legal integrity),so that small part manufacturers will be able to overcome the competitivedisadvantages of the performance warranty program, and that a bonding requirementcould be anti-competitive. <T3>SEMA</T3> v. <T3>Ruckelshaus,</T3> 720 F.2d at 140. Certain vehicle manufacturers nonetheless commented in response to theNPRM that in order to assure that part manufacturers have an equal incentiveand financial stake, an escrow account should be required. Specifically,they suggested that since the vehicle manufacturer must initially pay forrepairs, the part manufacturers should be required to set up an escrowaccount as a condition of certification or at the beginning of the arbitrationprocess. It was argued that an escrow account would bring the part manufacturersinto the dispute resolution mechanism with a financial stake equal to thatextended by the vehicle manufacturer. These vehicle manufacturers contendedthis may either lead to fewer requests for arbitration or quicker conclusions.One vehicle manufacturer suggested an option to require certification bondsfrom part manufacturers who have refused to pay claims, who are delinquentin paying claims, or who have demonstrated abnormally high dispute losses.It claimed that this requirement would have a potential to encourage promptresolution. Subsequently, many claims could be resolved without resortingto full arbitration. However, EPA still believes that the suggested financial instability ofcertified part manufacturers is purely speculative. To date, EPA is awareof no specific evidence which would indicate significant problems in thisarea. EPA has no information that suggests that part manufacturers wouldnot live up to their financial responsibilities and promptly pay validwarranty reimbursement claims. Similarly, there is no evidence at thistime that part manufacturers are likely to request arbitration on frivolousgrounds or to delay arbitration proceedings. Thus, the vehicle manufacturers'requests for an escrow or bonding requirement have no factual support.Moreover, as discussed in the NPRM and the SEMA opinion, such requirementscould be an economic disincentive to small part manufacturers to participatein certification and could increase the potential anti-competitive effectsof the performance warranty. Therefore, EPA rejects the commenters' requests.Nevertheless, for the sole purpose of defraying arbitration costs, a reasonabledeposit may be required from the parties prior to an arbitration hearing.EPA does not view such a deposit as a bond or escrow account. C. Denial of a Consumer Warranty Claim Based on the Use of an UncertifiedReplacement Part To deny a warranty claim based on a performance warranty failure involvingan uncertified part, the performance warranty regulations originally requiredthe vehicle manufacturer to present evidence that the uncertified partwas either defective in materials or workmanship, or not equivalent froman emissions standpoint to the original equipment part.\28\<NOTE/> Further, the uncertified part had to be relevant to the failurefor any warranty denial to occur.\29\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ 40 CFR 85.2105(b)(1) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ 40 CFR 85.2104(h)(3)The MVMA and the Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association (APRA) broughtlegal challenges to these regulations claiming that EPA exceeded its authorityin forcing vehicle manufacturers to carry the burden of demonstrating equivalencybefore they may deny a warranty claim.\30\<NOTE/> The court agreed that EPA may not shift the burden of demonstratingequivalency to the vehicle manufacturers, but permitted EPA to ``* * *require vehicle manufacturers to submit a statement (or other evidence)indicating why the uncertified part was relevant to the vehicles' emissionfailure.''\31\<NOTE/> The court indicated that EPA may use its expertise to decidewhat is the permissible information required for the vehicle manufacturerto demonstrate that the uncertified part was relevant to the emissionsfailure.\32\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>APRA</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 720 F.2d at 157. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Ibid., at 158-159 n.63 (emphasis in original).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Ibid. In the NPRM EPA proposed that, in lieu of demonstrating that an aftermarketpart is not equivalent to a comparable OEM part, the vehicle manufacturershould provide both written assertions and a list of available ``objectiveevidence'' (described below) used in the warranty denial determinationto demonstrate that the part was relevant to the failure. EPA determinedthat this approach would best ensure appropriate warranty denial decisions.In their comments, vehicle manufacturers expressed their concern over thescope of the ``objective evidence'' required in the NPRM. EPA had proposedthat ``objective evidence'' be defined to include any historical data suchas previous warranty claims, recall information, or manufacturer studieson similar phenomenon that were related to the current claim, as well asany diagnostic information used to make the warranty denial determination.EPA also stated in the NPRM that any evidence used by the vehicle manufacturerin the warranty denial should be accessible to the consumer upon request.Vehicle manufacturers commented they could not know which or how much pastinformation should be used to support a warranty denial and felt that assemblingand supplying this information could not be done in a timely manner. Theyalso felt that their dealers lack the technical expertise necessary toadminister a warranty denial based on objective evidence as described inthe NPRM. In light of the <T3>APRA </T3>court decision, EPA believes that a valid warranty denialdetermination will best be made if a comprehensive definition for objectiveevidence, such as that proposed in the NPRM, is adopted.\33\<NOTE/> Denying a consumer warranty coverage for a performance failurefor any reason is an important move and should be carried out only aftercareful consideration of the actual cause of failure. EPA's major concernsare that the vehicle noncompliance be appropriately diagnosed and repaired,to protect the environment, and that the consumer obtain the protectionafforded by the section 207(b) warranty when the failure is not causedby improper maintenance and use (as when the failure is caused by an uncertifiedpart). Only by requiring the vehicle manufacturer to demonstrate improperuse or maintenance or a relevant failure of an uncertified part to escapewarranty liability, can EPA assure that consumers will be encouraged touse section 207(b) and that they and the environment will get the benefitsCongress intended.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ At the same time, EPA recognizes that this places a burdenon the OEM for supporting a denial determination when, in fact, the OEMis not responsible for the part being on the vehicle in the first place.Nonetheless, the vehicle manufacturer is not automatically relieved ofresponsibility for its own part's performance merely by the presence ofan uncertified part on the vehicle. Nothing in the Act suggests that manufacturersmay deny warranty coverage solely on that basis. These final rules essentially adopt the NPRM proposal for denial of a performancewarranty claim involving an uncertified part. However, based on comments,EPA has revised the proposed definition for allowable ``objective evidence''to minimize the burden on the OEM's. The actual requirements adopted intoday's final rules were based on EPA's consideration, in light of thecomments, of what is minimally necessary to properly judge a warranty denialdetermination with due concern for the OEM manufacturers' burden. Under these final rules, the vehicle manufacturer will provide to the consumera written assertion that the uncertified part is the cause of a vehicle'semission test failure due to the part's own failure and/or damage to otherengine or emission components caused by the uncertified part.\34\<NOTE/> The written assertion will also state that the removal ofthe uncertified part and the reinstallation and recalibration of any OEMpart that was replaced or damaged by the uncertified part is expected torepair the emissions failure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Alternatively, the vehicle manufacturer could assertthat the uncertified part was installed improperly and therefore causedfailure to the vehicle emission system. However, in this case, as underthe current regulations, a warranty cannot be denied based on improperinstallation by an OEM authorized facility since consumers who, in goodfaith, had their vehicle repaired at an authorized facility should haveassurance that they will not lose their warranty due to improper serviceby the authorized facility. If the vehicle manufacturer claims other components have been subsequentlydamaged, the vehicle manufacturer will have to specify which componentswere affected, what appears to be wrong with the parts, and why the manufacturerbelieves the uncertified part caused the damage. This information mustalso be provided in writing to the consumer along with any objective evidenceused in the determination. ``Objective evidence'' is defined in these final rules as all diagnosticinformation and data, and any other information directly used in makingthe warranty denial determination. This eliminates the requirement thatthe vehicle manufacturer present historical data as proposed in the NPRM.EPA's new treatment of objective evidence should resolve vehicle manufacturers'concerns that certain information is not readily available or that OEMdealers do not have an adequate level of expertise to provide the informationrequired. If a dealer is unable to meet even this reduced level of demonstration,it is questionable whether the warranty denial was valid. At the same time,the revised requirements will still provide the consumer with access tosufficient information to determine the validity of the vehicle manufacturer'sdetermination. One vehicle manufacturer (Ford) recommended, as an alternative to EPA'sproposal on objective evidence, that verification that the remaining certifiedcomponents function properly be considered sufficient evidence that theaftermarket part caused the failure. EPA has considered this proposal buthas decided not to adopt this as an alternative method. A vehicle in itsoriginal configuration (no aftermarket parts installed) may fail an I/Mtest, yet all OEM emission components test out as functioning properly.This type of failure has been seen in specific instances in the I/M programand is called a ``pattern failure.'' Thus, while use of an uncertifiedpart on such a vehicle would not actually be the cause of the performancewarranty failure, the alternative method of demonstration proposed by Fordwould mistakenly identify the uncertified part as the cause of the failure.Furthermore, the actual cause of the pattern failure might never be identifiedand repaired properly. Many commenters recommended ``causal proof'' as a more appropriate methodfor denying warranty to an uncertified part. Commenters did not providea specific definition of causal proof. However, it appears they are referringto a procedure where the vehicle manufacturer identifies a part as uncertified,and only asserts that the uncertified part caused the failure (perhapswith some technical explanation short of any supportive evidence). However,this procedure would not provide the consumer with any concrete evidencethat the part caused the problem, and leaves the consumer with very littlerecourse but to pay for the repair. This would unduly limit the use of,and environmental benefits expected from, section 207(b)'s warranty requirement.In contrast, the final rules require the vehicle manufacturer to providethe consumer with a list of the factual information directly used in thewarranty denial determination, and then to provide the actual informationto the consumer on request. Since this information should be readily available,EPA believes the small additional burden to the vehicle manufacturer ismore than offset by the substantially improved position of the consumerattempting to judge the validity of a warranty denial. Thus, EPA rejectsthe commenters' suggestion. D. Labeling These final rules adopt the language proposed in the NPRM for certifiedaftermarket part labeling. Aftermarket part manufacturers will be requiredto identify their certified parts with unique, readable labels that aredurable for the useful life of the part as specified by the manufacturer.These unique certification labels and symbols may only be used on productionaftermarket parts that are certified through this regulation. Furthermore,if a manufacturer's part that was previously certified is later decertifiedunder andSection; 85.2118, that manufacturer may no longer use the uniquecertification label or symbol on any of these parts built or assembledafter the date of decertification. Comments to the NPRM suggest motor vehicleand aftermarket part manufacturers are in agreement with the language incorporatedin andSection; 85.2119. Several vehicle manufacturers also suggested that some sort of cataloguingor tracking system for certified parts should be utilized by EPA and providedto the vehicle manufacturers. Vehicle manufacturers are in favor of thisoption since it would provide them with an up to date ready reference ofall certified parts. This reference would make warranty claim decisionsmuch easier since their service departments would probably have accessto these references. EPA agrees with this comment. Therefore, EPA will make available a yearlylisting of certified aftermarket parts and each certified aftermarket partmanufacturer's unique symbol or identifier. In addition, EPA expects that,in order to promote the use and proper repair of their parts, part manufacturerswill provide the vehicle manufacturers with proof or a listing of theiractual certified parts.One part rebuilder association expressed concern over adequate space availabilityfor labels on a small part, especially one which has been rebuilt severaltimes. To deal with rebuilt parts and this potential problem of space forseveral logos for subsequent rebuilders, EPA will allow a subsequent rebuilderto remove or cover the previously applied label. E. 2 Year/24,000 Miles Quality Warranty Requirement These final rules do <T3>not </T3>adopt the NPRM proposal that would require a minimum ``acceptablequality'' warranty of 2 years or 24,000 miles. Part manufacturer associations (MEMA and SEMA) commented that the warrantyrequirement proposed in the NPRM would increase costs and that it wouldbe unnecessary because of current requirements that involve certificationand durability testing. They pointed out that the aftermarket part industrycurrently provides the level of quality and associated warranty coveragedemanded by the part purchaser. The consumers decide how much they wantto pay for additional warranty coverage. The quality of the parts that EPA approves is an important issue. The Agency'sintention in proposing this provision was to assure that only acceptablequality parts which the manufacturer will stand behind obtain EPA certification.However, EPA does not currently have evidence suggesting that existingemission related aftermarket parts are showing unacceptable quality. Therefore,EPA is not convinced that this provision is necessary, and the Agency willnot adopt the minimum quality warranty requirement proposed in the NPRM.However, if sufficient evidence arises showing that parts are not capableof performing for a reasonable lifetime (e.g., a minimum of 2 years or24,000 miles), then EPA may repropose this warranty option and revise thisregulation at a future date. F. Costs of Emission Testing and Durability Demonstration <ITAG tagnum="81">1. FTP Costs </ITAG>In the NPRM, EPA presented emission testing costs that the part manufacturerwould be expected to incur during the certification process. EPA's FTPcost figures of $600 to $900 per test were determined based on a surveyof independent laboratories that are available for all part manufacturersto use.\35\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ ``Cost of Alternative Short Tests'', EPA memo from M.Sabourin to R. Larson, Aug. 7, 1986, in the public docket andplusmin;EN-84-08. Several part manufacturer associations disagreed with EPA's cost estimates.These manufacturers submitted annual FTP costs per certified part whichare much higher than the   EPA estimates. There are several apparent reasonsfor their higher cost estimates. Some manufacturers indicated that certification using the FTP test cyclewould require them to run numerous FTP tests during the emission compliancedevelopment of their parts. However, EPA believes that even prior to amendmentof these certification regulations, many part manufacturers probably haddeveloped their parts sufficiently so that little if any additional emissiondevelopment will be necessary. Many of these aftermarket part manufacturersalso supply the OEM's with parts. The OEM parts have proven emission performance.The development that goes into the parts supplied to the OEM is likelyin many cases to be directly transferable to the aftermarket parts. Similarly,aftermarket parts which are designed to be functionally equivalent (orsuperior) to the OEM part should not require any significant further developmentto assure their emission performance prior to certification. Only in the case of unique parts which alter or are significantly differentfrom the OEM parts, such as specialty parts, is there a concern that significantemission development work might be necessary prior to certification demonstration.It is impossible, however, for EPA to determine if significant developmentwork will be necessary for specialty parts or to estimate the cost of thatdevelopment should it be necessary. However, the strong interest in thecertification program shown by the specialty parts manufacturers suggeststhat this segment of the aftermarket part industry is confident in theemission control capability of their parts and anxious to prove this capabilityvia the voluntary aftermarket part certification program. EPA believesthis confidence in the emission performance capability of these parts isbased upon reasoned analysis supported by data. In such a case, the amountof additional development work should also be minimal. Finally, although the FTP cycle is relied upon for certification demonstration,the manufacturer has at its disposable a wide range of alternative evaluationtests and criteria including, for example, material and structural analysesand bench tests. EPA expects the competent manufacturers to make full useof these alternative evaluations, many of which would be far less expensiveand often more useful for development purposes than the FTP test. Thus,EPA rejects the commenters suggestions that FTP testing during the developmentprocess will be a widespread and frequent occurrence. One commenter (SEMA) also stated that, based on the ``worst case'' vehicleselection criteria presented in the NPRM, most part manufacturers wouldneed to test ten or more worst case vehicle configurations per part permodel year to ensure the appropriate application was tested. Thus, itsresulting cost estimates were based on a large number of test vehicles.In these final rules, EPA has adopted an alternative for worst case vehicleselection that specifically identifies the criteria for selection of twoworst case vehicles. This clear guidance should make it unnecessary fora part manufacturer to test more than two vehicles to certify. Part manufacturersthat have determined that they can appropriately select the one worst-caseapplication as proposed in the NPRM may still do so. Furthermore, sinceone part likely will often have application over more than one model year,vehicle selection is not model year specific and parts are not requiredto be recertified every model year (unless a new model year applicationis not properly represented by previous worst case vehicles).Based on the cost figures presented in the NPRM, and after consideringcomments on certification costs, EPA estimates the cost of FTP tailpipeemissions testing to be $600-$900 per test. This is based on a survey ofindependent laboratories which are available for all part manufacturersto use.\36\<NOTE/> This cost does not include SHED testing (as SHED testingis not required unless parts  affect evaporative emission results). Forcomponents requiring SHED tests instead of tailpipe emissions tests (i.e.,components affecting evaporative emission control only), EPA estimatesthat the cost will not be greater than the tailpipe FTP cost of $600-$900per test.\37\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Ibid. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Ibid. Either one or two worst-case vehicles are required to be tested for eachpart, leading to a total FTP certification cost between $1200-$3600 perpart (based on a minimum of two tests per part at $600 per test, up tofour tests per part at $900 per test). Such FTP costs can be amortizedover the applicable vehicle models and model years of the certified part.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Durability Costs </ITAG>As indicated in the NPRM and earlier in this preamble, durability demonstrationrequirements, and therefore costs, will differ significantly among partsto be certified. Many of the parts to be certified will be eligible fordurability exemption. In these cases, the manufacturer does not incur adurability cost. Furthermore, in those other cases requiring durabilitydemonstration, one part will likely work for many vehicle applicationsover a number of model years and one durability vehicle may suffice torepresent a large number of applications for a part. This will help controlcosts for the part manufacturer. Also, the regulations allow for alternative mileage accumulation cycleswhich may be less expensive than that described in 40 CFR Part 86, appendixIV. The manufacturer may opt to use an alternative durability cycle ifit determines that the alternative cycle is at least as representativeof typical in-use operation as the cycle described in appendix IV of theFTP. For example, the manufacturer may determine that an ``on road'' durabilitycycle may be representative of an aftermarket part's aging and thereforesuitable for durability demonstration. EPA currently evaluates and approvesalternative durability cycles through its policy described in AdvisoryCircular 37-A. One part manufacturer association (SEMA) estimated a durability cost of$80,000 per part. This is an accurate cost figure for current large volumevehicle manufacturers who support entire in-house programs of multiplevehicles and run vehicles sufficient to represent each engine family tobe certified each model year. It is highly unlikely that a durability vehiclewill be required for every aftermarket part certified, or that the partmanufacturer will choose to pay to run a vehicle just for part durabilitydemonstration. Several testing facilities have submitted information toEPA to demonstrate that alternative, less expensive, mileage accumulationcycles are available that are at least as stringent as the currently approvedcycle listed in the Federal Regulations. At least one of these cycles costsaround five cents per mile plus a $200 to $300 report charge. Thus, durabilitymileage accumulation could cost around $3,000 when durability testing isnecessary. However, EPA expects that durability demonstrations will typicallynot be utilized, especially in the initial years of implementation. Initially,manufacturers are more likely to choose to voluntarily certify those partsthat are technically and economically easier to certify (i.e., those thatare eligible for durability exemption or eligible for an alternative cycle).Since they may rarely durability test a part, the durability cost amortizedover every part will likely be even less than $3,000 per part. For the above reasons, EPA believes that FTP testing and durability demonstrationcosts will, for the great majority of parts, be much less than certainpart manufacturers have suggested and that the actual costs of certificationwill be reasonable and appropriate given the purposes and requirementsof the certification program. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements </ITAG>The Agency does not believe the additional reporting and recordkeepingrequirements imposed by this amendment to the regulations are burdensome.An economic impact analysis was prepared for the original 1980 rulemakingand is contained in Central Docket andplusmin;EN-79-8. The document concludedthat the regulations did not pose a significant cost to the parties involved.The modifications being adopted here should not increase that cost substantially.These revisions to the regulations would impose some new reporting andrecordkeeping requirements on aftermarket part manufacturers that chooseto take advantage of the certification program, as well as the vehiclemanufacturers. The addition of a reimbursement mechanism will require recordkeeping.The certification program will be extended to include manufacturers ofparts not certifiable under the regulations before these revisions. Thenew manufacturers will need to keep records and report certification. Thenew requirements for labeling may increase some manufacturer material expenses.As noted in the information collection request document approved for thesefinal rules under OMB control number 2060-0060, this burden was estimatedat $166,500 at the time of proposal. No commenters disagreed with thisestimate and EPA believes it is still correct.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in these rules have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0060. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 124 hours per response including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirements of a regulatory impact analysis.This regulation should not be considered a major regulation because itmeets none of the conditions for a major regulation. As discussed fullyin the Summary and Analysis of Comments (see Docket andplusmin;EN-84-08),these final rules will have an annual effect on the economy of less than$100 million. It is estimated that at most a retail price and service repairvalue of $2 billion of emission related parts will be certified in anyone year. About 1 percent or $20 million worth of parts will require warrantyservice each year, which represents most of the economic impact of thisregulation (certification costs, in comparison, will be far less than warrantyrepair costs). This will not cause a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions. Nor will there be any significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of U.S. based enterprises to compete with foreign basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. These final rules and certain accompanying documents were submitted tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by ExecutiveOrder 12291. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any EPA written responseto those comments are available for public inspection in the docket forthis rulemaking; Docket andplusmin;EN-84-08. The EPA's Central Docket Section(LE-131) is located at 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC, 20460. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA is requiredto determine whether a final regulation will have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities so as to require a regulatoryflexibility analysis. Several aftermarket part manufacturer organizations contested EPA's assertionin the NPRM that there would be no significant adverse impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because of the aftermarket part certificationprogram, given that the program is voluntary. SEMA stated that certification is not voluntary since it is the only meansthat its members can use to eliminate the potentially anti-competitiveeffects of the CAA warranties. EPA has no data or other information whichestablishes the potentially anti-competitive effects of the CAA warrantiesclaimed by SEMA. EPA also has no data which could be used to evaluate anycountervailing impact of the aftermarket certification program. However,if SEMA believes that sales of its members' parts will significantly increaseas a result of certification, then it follows that the aftermarket certificationprogram will have a beneficial impact on aftermarket part manufacturersby reducing or eliminating the anti-competitive effects of the CAA performancewarranty. These regulations open up the certification program to allowcertification of all types of components which are emission related (includingthe specialty parts manufactured by SEMA's members) and adopt a relativelylow cost compliance demonstration program so that most potential certifiersof quality aftermarket parts will not be economically excluded. EPA hopesthat other manufacturers will see advantages in certifying aftermarketparts which will tend to proliferate the quantity and choice of aftermarketparts with proven emission control capability. Thus, rather than havingan adverse impact on small part manufacturers these final rules shouldbenefit any manufacturers that choose to take advantage of them. Another commenter stated that, as an aftermarket part manufacturer, itwould be forced to participate in the program and absorb all associatedcosts in order to compete with larger suppliers of certified aftermarketparts. EPA agrees that the part manufacturer will incur some costs if itchooses to certify a part. However, EPA believes that these final ruleswill aid competition by providing the opportunity for part manufacturersto sell emission related parts with reduced or no anti-competitive effectsfrom the performance warranty program. EPA has designed these final rules to minimize certification demonstrationcosts while at the same time providing necessary assurance of adequateemission control. Two measures have been adopted to reduce durability costs.First, for components that are likely to be repaired or replaced in actualuse, these parts are exempted from any independent certification durabilitydemonstration. Second, for parts that do require durability testing, EPAexpects that many will be able to demonstrate no additional deteriorationof other emission related components; these parts can be aged on a vehiclewhich in itself does not need to meet emission standards. This should helplimit the durability test costs for these aftermarket parts. Emission compliance demonstration cost is also minimized by not requiringthe emission test vehicle to meet standards. Rather the changes in emissionsdue to aftermarket part installation is quantified and compared to thepreexisting certification vehicle emissions margin for vehicle designs.Again, vehicle and test costs are minimized. Finally, worst case testingis allowed to reduce the number of required test vehicles and emissiontests. Only in the case of short test versus FTP test costs was EPA unableto find a more economic, acceptable cost reduction alternative. Even inthis case, the estimated cost differential between the required FTP testsand short tests is likely less than $3,600 per part certified. This shouldnot represent a significant barrier to aftermarket part certification formost manufacturers. I hereby certify that this regulation will not have a significant adverseimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Specialty part manufacturers(who are often small) will be eligible for the first time to certify underthis revised aftermarket part certification program which should benefitthese manufacturers. The potential adverse impact is further minimizedsince the program is voluntary and, presumably, no part manufacturer willparticipate unless it sees an economic benefit to doing so. Further, forthose manufacturers that choose to participate, certification of qualityparts should be attainable at a reasonable cost. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 85 </ITAG>Imports, Labeling, Motor vehicle pollution, reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Research, Warranties.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7522, 7541, 7542, and 7601(a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

Section 85.2114 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 85.2114</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Basis of certification. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Prior to certifying,</T3> the aftermarket part manufacturer must determine:(1) Whether the part to be certified is an emission related part as definedin andSection; 85.2102. The MOD Director shall deny certification to anyparts which he or she determines is not an emission related part. (2) The vehicle or engine configurations for which this part is being certified.These are the vehicle and engine designs for which the aftermarket partmanufacturer intends to sell the certified aftermarket part. (3) Whether the part qualifies under one of the part categories, listedin andSection; 85.2122 of this subpart that are eligible to certify usingemission critical parameters and, if so, whether the manufacturer electsto demonstrate certification using emission critical parameters. An aftermarketpart may be certified under this category only if the part's emission-criticalparameters, as set forth in andSection; 85.2122, are equivalent to thoseof the original equipment or previously certified part it is to replace.Compliance with the emission-critical parameters discussed in paragraph(b) of this section may be demonstrated by compliance with the relevanttest procedures and criteria specified in appendix I to this subpart. Therequirements of this paragraph apply to all on-road vehicles and engines.Alternatively, the manufacturer may elect to demonstrate certificationcompliance according to the emission test procedures described in paragraph(c) of this section. (b) <T3>For parts eligible to certify using emission-critical parameters, certificationcompliance can be demonstrated as follows.</T3> (1) The durability procedurecontained in Appendix I to this subpart can be used. As an alternative,the aftermarket part manufacturer may use a different durability procedureif it can demonstrate to the MOD Director that the alternative procedureresults in an improved technical evaluation of the part's influence onvehicle or engine emissions for its useful life mileage interval, or resultsin a significant cost savings to the aftermarket part manufacturer withno loss in technical validity compared to the recommended durability procedure.The aftermarket part manufacturer shall receive the written approval fromthe MOD Director prior to implementation of the alternative procedures.(2) Compliance with certification requirements is based on conformancewith all emission-critical parameters in andSection; 85.2122. This shallbe accomplished by performing such procedures, tests, or analyses describedin appendix I, or other procedures subject to the MOD Director's approval,necessary to ascertain with a high degree of certainty the emission-criticalparameter specifications and tolerances for the aftermarket part and theoriginal equipment or previously certified part for which an equivalentaftermarket certified part is to be used. (i) If information is available in Appendix I of this subpart to identifythe applicable emission-critical parameters, the aftermarket part certifiermust use such information. (ii) If sampling and analysis of original equipment or previously certifiedparts is relied upon, the aftermarket part certifier must use sound statisticalsampling techniques to ascertain the mean and range of the applicable emissionparameters.(iii) If an aftermarket part replaces more than one part on the same application,it may be certified only if the aftermarket part meets the applicable emission-criticalparameters of andSection; 85.2122 for each part or parts which the aftermarketpart is to replace. If an aftermarket part is to replace more than onepart or an entire system, compliance must be demonstrated for all emission-criticalparameters involved, except those which relate solely to the interfacebetween the parts being replaced by the aftermarket part. (c) <T3>For parts certifying on the basis of emission test results, durabilitydemonstration testing shall be conducted as follows. </T3>(1) Prior tocertification emission testing, the actual aftermarket part used for certificationtesting must meet the durability demonstration requirements of this paragraphfor at least the part's useful life mileage interval. (i) If an original equipment part has no scheduled replacement interval,then the useful life mileage interval of the aftermarket part of that typeor which replaces the function of that part may be certified with a serviceinterval less than the useful life of the motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine, or (ii) If any provision of 40 CFR part 86 establishes a minimum replacementor service interval for an original equipment part during vehicle or enginecertification, then the useful life mileage interval of the aftermarketpart of that type or which replaces the function of that part is said minimuminterval. (2) The part manufacturer must decide whether it can demonstrate to theMOD Director that, during normal vehicle operation, the candidate partwill not accelerate deterioration of any original equipment emission relatedparts. This demonstration must be based on technical rationale that showsthat the candidate part has no significant physical or operational effecton any original emission components or system which would be differentthan that experienced by the vehicle operating with all original equipmentemission system parts. The part's effect on each major emission systemmust be addressed separately in the demonstration. (i) If the aftermarket part to be certified accelerates deterioration ofany existing emission related parts then certification shall be carriedout as specified under the paragraph (c)(3) of this section for parts thataccelerate deterioration of existing emission related parts. (ii) If the aftermarket part manufacturer can demonstrate that the partto be certified will not accelerate deterioration of any existing emissionrelated components, then the manufacturer can certify according to paragraph(c)(4) in this section for parts demonstrated to not accelerate deteriorationof existing emission related parts. (3) <T3>For aftermarket parts that accelerate deterioration of existing emissionrelated parts during normal operation. </T3>(i) The aftermarket test partcan be installed on the durability test vehicle and aged for 50,000 milesusing the vehicle durability driving schedules contained in part 86, appendixIV. As an alternative, the aftermarket part manufacturer may use a differentdurability procedure if it can demonstrate to the MOD Director that thealternative procedure results in an improved technical evaluation of thepart's influence on vehicle or engine emissions for the part's useful lifemileage interval, or results in a significant cost savings to the aftermarketpart manufacturer with no loss in technical validity compared to the recommendeddurability schedules in part 86, appendix IV. The aftermarket part manufacturershall receive the written approval from the MOD Director prior to implementationof the alternative procedures.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>At the time of certification emission testing, the samepart and vehicle combination used for mileage accumulation shall be usedfor emission testing.</ITAG>(ii) Where the comparable original equipment part has a recommended replacementinterval of less than 50,000 miles, the test part shall be replaced nosooner than its useful life mileage interval during the required 50,000mile durability demonstration.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>At the time of certification emission testing, one of theaftermarket parts that accumulated at least its useful life mileage duringthe aging process under this paragraph shall be installed on the durabilitytest vehicle that has accumulated 50,000 miles.</ITAG>(4) <T3>For aftermarket parts demonstrated not to accelerate deteriorationon existing emission related parts during normal operation, </T3>the partmanufacturer must determine whether the part will cause a noticeable changein vehicle driveability. (i) Parts that cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveability, performance,and/or fuel economy when the part fails, the durability driving schedulescontained in part 86, appendix IV can be used. As an alternative, the aftermarketpart manufacturer may use a different durability procedure if it can demonstrateto the MOD Director that the alternative procedure results in an improvedtechnical evaluation of the part's influence on vehicle or engine emissionsfor its useful life mileage interval, or results in a significant costsavings to the aftermarket part manufacturer with no loss in technicalvalidity compared to the durability schedules in part 86, appendix IV.The aftermarket part manufacturer shall receive the written approval fromthe MOD Director prior to implementation of the alternative procedures.(ii) Parts demonstrated to cause a noticeable change in vehicle driveability,performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, are exempt from agingif the part manufacturer can demonstrate to the MOD Director that the primaryfailure mode of the aftermarket component or system affects the driveability,performance, and/or fuel economy of the vehicle at a level readily detectableby the driver and likely to result in near term repair of failing componentsand correction of the emissions failure. (Use of on-board diagnostics andmalfunction indicators as covered in paragraph (g) of this section is notnecessarily an adequate demonstration that the certified part will be replaced.The part manufacturer must demonstrate that the diagnostic and malfunctionindicator system will routinely result in repair or replacement of thepart in use).(5) <T3>For parts which only affect evaporative emissions performance, </T3>theaftermarket part manufacturer shall determine and demonstrate to the MODDirector the appropriate durability procedure to age its part. The demonstrationshall include all documentation, analyses, and test results that supportthis determination, and the documentation that support the durability procedureresults shall be submitted with the notification of intent to certify asper andSection; 85.2115 and is subject to MOD Director's review. (6) <T3>Durability demonstration vehicle selection.</T3> The demonstrationvehicle used must represent the ``worst case'' of all the configurationsfor which the aftermarket part is being certified. The worst case configurationshall be that configuration which will likely cause the most deteriorationin the performance characteristics of the aftermarket part which influenceemissions during the part's useful life mileage. The worst case configurationshall be selected from among those configurations for which the aftermarketpart is to be certified. One of the following two methods shall be usedto select the worst case durability demonstration vehicle(s): (i) In the first method, the selection shall be based on a technical judgmentby the aftermarket part manufacturer of the impact of the particular design,or calibration of a particular parameter or combination of parameters,and/or an analysis of appropriate data, or (ii) In the second alternative method, the selection shall be made fromamong those vehicle configurations with the heaviest equivalent test weight,and within that group, the largest displacement engine. (d) <T3>For parts certifying on the basis of emission test results, certificationcompliance shall be demonstrated as follows.</T3> (1) The emission testto be used is the Federal Test Procedure as set forth in the applicableportions of 40 CFR part 86. Certification emission testing must be carriedout using representative production aftermarket parts as provided in paragraph(e) of this section. The test results must demonstrate that the properinstallation of the certified aftermarket part will not cause the vehicleto fail to meet any applicable Federal emission requirements under section202 of the Act. (2) The following portions of the Federal Test Procedure are not requiredto be performed when certifying a part using emission testing: (i) The evaporative emissions portion, if the aftermarket manufacturerhas an adequate technical basis for believing that the part has no effecton the vehicle's evaporative emissions; (ii) The exhaust emissions portion, if the part manufacturer has an adequatetechnical basis for believing that the part has no affect on the vehicle'sexhaust emissions; and (iii) Other portions therein which the part manufacturer believes are notrelevant; <T3>Provided, That </T3>the part manufacturer has requested and been granteda waiver in writing by the MOD Director for excluding such portion. (3) Exhaust Emission Testing. Certification exhaust emission testing foraftermarket parts shall be carried out in the following manner: (i) For light duty vehicle parts that accelerate deterioration of existingemission related parts, at least one emission test is required. The test(s)shall be performed according to the Federal Test Procedure on the sametest vehicle and aftermarket part combination that was previously agedas required. The results of all tests performed shall be averaged for eachemission constituent. The average values shall meet all applicable Federalemission requirements under section 202 of the Act. (A) For aftermarket parts where the comparable original equipment parthas no recommended replacement interval, the same part and vehicle combinationused for the durability demonstration shall be used for certification exhaustemission testing. (B) For aftermarket parts where the comparable original equipment parthas a recommended replacement interval of less than 50,000 miles, one ofthe aftermarket parts that accumulated at least the part's useful lifemileage during the durability demonstration must be installed on the durabilitydemonstration vehicle that has accumulated 50,000 miles for certificationexhaust emission testing.(ii) For light duty truck parts that accelerate deterioration of existingemission related parts. (A) An emission test shall be performed on emission test vehicles at 4000miles and at 50,000 miles, with the part installed. Exhaust emission deteriorationfactors for the test vehicle shall be calculated from these two test results.The aftermarket part manufacturer may elect to perform other emission testsat interim mileages. However, any interim tests must be spaced at equalmileage intervals. If more than one test is performed at any one mileagepoint, then all tests at this point shall be averaged prior to determiningthe deterioration factor. The deterioration factor shall be calculatedusing the least squares straight line method, in accordance with andSection;86.088-28(a). The deterioration factor for each emission constituent shallbe used to linearly project the 50,000 mile test result out to 120,000miles. The projected 120,000 mile test result shall meet light duty truckemission standards. (B) As an option, the light-duty truck part manufacturer may durabilityage the test vehicle and aftermarket part to 120,000 miles, and then performone Federal Test Procedure test. The actual test results in this case mustpass all Federal emission standards. (iii) For parts demonstrated to not accelerate deterioration of existingemission related parts during normal operation: (A) If parts cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveability, performance,and/or fuel economy when the part fails, the certification exhaust emissiontest vehicle need not be the same vehicle as that used for durability demonstration.Upon completion of aging, one Federal Test Procedure test shall be performedwith the aged aftermarket part installed on a test vehicle that has justcompleted one Federal Test Procedure test in the original equipment configuration(i.e., before the aftermarket part or system is installed). If more thanone test is performed either before or after the aftermarket part is installed,then an equivalent number of tests must be performed in both configurations.The results of all tests performed before the part is installed shall beaveraged and the results of all tests performed after the part is installedshall be averaged for each emission constituent. The difference in FederalTest Procedure emission results between the tests with the aged aftermarketpart installed and the test vehicle in the original equipment configurationshall be less than or equal to the certification vehicle emission marginof any and all of the certification test vehicles from the various configurationsfor which the aftermarket part is being certified. (B) For parts demonstrated to cause a noticeable change in vehicle driveability,performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, no durability agingof the part is required before certification emission testing. One FederalTest Procedure test shall be performed on the test vehicle in its originalequipment configuration (i.e., before the aftermarket part or system isinstalled) and one test with an aftermarket part representative of production(as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) installed on the test vehicle.If more than one test is performed either before or after the aftermarketpart is installed, then an equivalent number of tests must be performedin both configurations. The results of all tests performed with the aftermarketpart installed shall be averaged and the results of all tests performedin the original equipment configuration shall be averaged for each emissionconstituent. The difference in Federal Test Procedure emission resultsbetween the tests with the aftermarket part installed and the test vehiclein the original equipment configuration shall be less than or equal tothe certification vehicle emission margin of any and all of the certificationtest vehicles from the various configurations for which the aftermarketpart is being certified. (4) Evaporative emission testing. For parts determined by  the part manufacturer(with appropriate technical rationale) to affect only evaporative emissionsperformance, at least one evaporative emissions portion of the FederalTest Procedure test shall be performed on the vehicle in its original equipmentconfiguration and at least one with the aftermarket part installed. Boththe original equipment and aftermarket part shall be aged according toparagraph (c)(5) of this section prior to testing. If more than one testis performed either before or after the aftermarket part is installed,then an equivalent number of tests must be performed in both configurations.The emission results of all tests performed before the part is installedshall be averaged and the emission results of all tests performed afterthe part is installed shall be averaged. The difference in Federal TestProcedure emission results between the tests with the aged aftermarketpart installed and the test vehicle in the original equipment configurationshall be less than or equal to the certification vehicle emission marginof any and all of the certification test vehicles from the various configurationsfor which the aftermarket part is being certified. (5) Emission test vehicle selection: The test vehicle used must representthe ``worst case'' with respect to emissions of all those configurationsfor which the aftermarket part is being certified. The worst case configurationshall be that configuration which, having the aftermarket part installed,is least likely to meet the applicable emission standards among all thoseconfigurations on which the aftermarket part is intended to be installedas a certified aftermarket part. One of the following two methods shallbe used to select the worst case emission test vehicle(s): (i) In the first method, the selection shall be based on a technical judgmentby the aftermarket part manufacturer of the impact of the particular designor calibration of a particular parameter or combination of parameters and/oran analysis of appropriate data, or (ii) In the second alternative method, two defined worst case test vehiclesshall be selected from the vehicle configurations using the following criteria:(A) The first test vehicle is that engine family for which the largestnumber of parts are projected to be sold. Within that family the manufacturershall select the configurations with the heaviest equivalent test weight,and then within that group the configuration with the largest displacementengine.(B) The second test vehicle shall be from a different vehicle manufacturerthan the first test vehicle, or if the aftermarket part applies to onlyone vehicle manufacturer, from a different engine family. Engine familiesare determined by the vehicle manufacturer or when certifying under 40CFR Part 86. Within that group, the second test vehicle is selected fromthe vehicle configurations with the heaviest equivalent test weight, andthen, within that group, the configuration with the largest displacementengine. If a part applies to only one engine family then only the vehiclespecified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A), of this section, is required to betested. (iii) The results of certification tests using the worst case vehicle selectionsmade in this section shall only be applicable for configurations that arerequired to meet the same or less stringent (numerically higher) emissionstandards than those of the worst case configuration. (iv) The worst case test vehicle(s) selected for certification emissiontesting is(are) not required to meet Federal emission standards in itsoriginal configuration. However, each test vehicle shall have representativeemissions performance that is close to the standards and have no obviousemission defects. Each test vehicle shall be tuned properly and set tothe vehicle manufacturer's specifications before testing is performed.Any excessively worn or malfunctioning emission related part shall be repairedprior to testing. (e) <T3>Test part selection.</T3> Certification shall be based upon tests utilizingrepresentative production aftermarket parts selected in a random mannerin accordance with accepted statistical procedures. (f) <T3>Replacing original equipment parts.</T3> Installation of any certifiedaftermarket part shall not result in the removal or rendering inoperativeof any original equipment emission related part other than the part(s)being replaced. Furthermore, installation of any certified aftermarketpart shall not require the readjustment of any other emission related partto other than the vehicle manufacturer specifications, cause or contributeto an unreasonable risk to the public health, welfare or safety, or resultin any additional range of parameter adjustability or accessibility toadjustment than that of the vehicle manufacturer's emission related parts.(g) <T3>Affects on vehicle on board diagnostic system.</T3> Installation ofany certified aftermarket part shall not alter or render inoperative anyfeature of the on-board diagnostic system incorporated by the vehicle manufacturer.The certified part may integrate with the existing diagnostic system ifit does not alter or render inoperative any features of the system. However,use of on-board diagnostics or warning indicators to alert the driver topart failure is not sufficient by itself to qualify the part for exemptionfrom aging under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The part manufacturermust demonstrate that the diagnostic and malfunction indicator system willroutinely result in repair or replacement of the aftermarket part in use.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the controlnumber 2060-0016)</ITAG>13.

This aftermarket part warranty shall extend for the remainingperformance warranty period of any vehicle on which the part is installed,or for the warranty period specified for an equivalent original equipmentcomponent, if this period is shorter than the remaining warranty periodof the vehicle. (2) The aftermarket part manufacturer's minimum obligation under this warrantyshall be to reimburse vehicle manufacturers for all reasonable expensesincurred as a result of honoring a valid emission performance warrantyclaim which arises because of the use of the certified aftermarket part.(3) The procedure used to process a certified aftermarket part warrantyclaim is as follows. The time requirements are in units of calendar days.(i) The vehicle manufacturer shall submit, by certified mail or anothermethod by which date of receipt can be established, a bill for reasonableexpenses incurred to the part manufacturer for reimbursement. Accompanyingthe bill shall be a letter to the part manufacturer with an explanationof how the certified part caused the failure and a copy of the warrantyrepair order or receipt establishing the date that the performance repairwas initiated by the vehicle owner. (ii) The parts retained pursuant to andSection; 85.2107(c)(1) shall be retaineduntil the reimbursement process is resolved. The vehicle manufacturer shallstore these parts or transfer these parts to the involved certified partmanufacturer for storage. If the vehicle manufacturer transfers these partsto the certified part manufacturer, the part manufacturer shall retainthese parts:(A) For at least one year from the date of repair involving these parts,if the part manufacturer does not receive a bill from the vehicle manufacturerwithin that time period, or (B) Until the claim reimbursement process has been resolved, if the partmanufacturer receives a bill from the vehicle manufacturer within one yearof the date of repair involving these parts.
