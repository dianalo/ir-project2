SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Today's hottest computers are portable, fromone-pound palmtops to hefty but high-powered 20-pounders withhandles, sellers said Tuesday at the world's biggest computer tradeshow.   Perhaps hottest of all at the Comdex show are Compaq ComputerCorp.'s six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines.   ``Sales have been very good, I would say better than expected,''Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive, said in aninterview.   Compaq's machines are the first of their size to accept the3{-inch floppy disks that are standard in many desktop computers.That's more convenient than other machines that use memory cards orsmaller disks.   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in themonth since they introduced the LTE, which begins at about $2,400,and the LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286 microprocessor andlists for $3,900 to $5,000.   Canion said the only compromise was on the screen, which is lesssharp than the one on Apple Computer Inc.'s 14-pound MacintoshPortable.   ``What we found was that most people would trade off that(screen) in return for the small size,'' Canion said.   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers isthe NEC Ultralite, a pioneer when it was introduced a year ago. Itweighs just 4.4 pounds, has a bigger screen than the LTE's, andcosts about the same, with a basic list price of $2,500. Storage ofinformation is on memory cards.   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops orbreast pocket computers made by the Atari and Poqet corporations.   Atari's Portfolio, which operates on two AA batteries for 48hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for $400. Not intended torival its bigger and more expensive cousins, it has five simplebuilt-in programs.   At about $2,000, Poqet's palmtop offers a bigger screen andkeyboard, all within the tiny package.   At the other extreme of the lightweight scale is Dolch ComputerSystems' ``portable'' that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor,the hottest, most powerful chip in the world for personal computers.   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, butcompany president Volker Dolch says it can compete in performancewith very high-end desktop computers and work stations. He claimsit is more than twice as fast as its closest competitor, theToshiba 5200.   The potential buyers, who Dolch calls ``power users on the go,''will pay a premium for the privilege of lugging the computeraround. It ranges from about $13,000 to $18,000.</TEXT></DOC>
