The writer wanted to use an Aretha Franklin song that wouldrelate to the struggle of the people, and he asked flight attendantGermaine Smith for help, according to the Detroit Free Press. TheDetroit News carried a similar report.   Smith, of Hyattsville, Md., suggested the Marvin Gaye song``What's Going On,'' which Mandela quoted in his June 28 speech atTiger Stadium.   The lyrics, ``Brother, brother, there's far too many of youdying. Mother, mother, there's far too many of you crying,'' werequoted by Mandela in reference to the violence and squalidconditions endured by many blacks in racially segregated SouthAfrica.   Before quoting from the late Gaye's 1971 hit, Mandela told thesold-out crowd that he listened to ``Motortown'' music during his27{ years in prison on a sabotage conviction.   Gaye recorded on the Detroit-founded Motown record label.</TEXT></DOC>
