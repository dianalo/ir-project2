The Delta rocket contained a 6,000-pound spacecraft that will spend more than 10 days in orbit, gathering data and transmitting it back to earth. If the $250 million project succeeds, SDI officials said, it will move the U.S. closer to knowing whether space-based anti-missile systems can track and intercept enemy missiles.    The experiment is largely aimed at one of the most daunting challenges that would face any space-based defense: discriminating between decoys, chaff and actual warheads traveling through space.    Critics of SDI, also called Star Wars, have argued that the Soviet Union could foil any such U.S. system by hurling up hundreds of decoys along with the actual warheads. The mass of objects would overwhelm the array of sensors and weapons, these critics argued, and many of the real warheads would get through to their targets.    The space vehicle launched yesterday was programmed to throw out 15 objects and observe their movements within the first 12 hours. The objects were in different sizes and compositions, so that the vehicle could record &quot;how different objects behave in the space environment,&quot; said Army Col. Ray Ross, director of the kinetic-energy program of the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. This information could be used to program future space sensors to distinguish warheads from decoys.    In addition to observing the objects, the space vehicle will collect data on a rocket launch and on the gases emitted by vehicles in space. The mission is also designed to gather data on what space objects look like set against different backgrounds. Pentagon officials said the Earth's surface creates a glow that changes from one time of day to another, complicating the task of tracking missiles.    The spacecraft, which will follow an elliptical orbit about 180 nautical miles above the earth, is programmed to perform 200 separate maneuvers in space. During the mission, it will interact with 100 ground-based radars and receiving stations run by the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    The rocket launch, originally scheduled for last Thursday, was delayed because of problems with the launch system.    The launch was handled by NASA, and the project is being run by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., Johns Hopkins University and Arlington, Va.-based Anser Analytic Services Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
