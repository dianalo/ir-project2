<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0203 </DOCNO><TEXT>A conceptual design for a nuclear physics interaction region at PEP ispresented. The design is based on components of the 2{gamma} (PEP-9)detector, configured as a large acceptance forward angle spectrometersuited for asymmetric fixed target kinematics. The system is evaluatedwith a prototype experiment in mind, namely pion production in quasielastickinematics, (e,e'{pi}). Issues and open questions particular to internaltarget work are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
