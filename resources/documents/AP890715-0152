DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A proposed rule change in an obscure aspect ofU.S. securities law signals that federal regulators are ready to goglobal.   As the drive toward automated trading and internationally linkedmarkets accelerates, the Securities and Exchange Commission hasdecided to proceed _ in a toned down version _ with a proposal thatwould make it easier for U.S. and foreign corporations to raisemoney through the private sale of securities.   It's called Rule 144a, and although SEC officials and industryexperts concede it won't have much direct effect on the averageAmerican, it has generated an enormous amount of interest in thefinancial community and press.   ``I used to call it `The Satanic Verses' of the securitiesindustry,'' said Sara Hanks, an SEC official in Washington. Firstproposed last October, Rule 144a _ like the controversial SalmanRushdie novel _ remained obscure to all but devotees until it waspublicly attacked and turned into a hot news story. ``We got somevery inflammatory headlines,'' she said.   Supporters said it would lower financing costs for U.S. companieswhile enticing foreign corporations, previously discouraged by SECregistration and disclosure requirements, to raise capital here.   But critics claimed the rule change would increase the power oflarge institutional investors, like banks and insurance companies,by eroding the already shrinking public securities markets whereinvestors, big and small, are considered equal.   That private market has mushroomed from $16 billion or nearly 22percent of the total securities market in 1980 to about $200 billionor almost 43 percent last year, according to IDD InformationServices, a firm that tracks trends in the financial industry.   After some etooling following input from the securities industryand stock exchange officials, the SEC voted 5-0 last week to seekadditional comment on Rule 144a.   The modified version was one of five proposals cleared by the SEClast week addressing problems raised by the globalization offinancial markets, which has made it easy to trade U.S. stocks inSingapore and British stocks in New York.   ``International markets are increasingly automated andinterlinked,'' SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a Senatesubcommittee hearing on globalization last month.   ``As dramatically illustrated by the October 1987 market break(the SEC's term for the stock market crash), events in one country'ssecurities markets may affect those in other countries.''   Rule 144a, if approved by the SEC, would loosen restraints on thetrading in the private placement market, securities that areexempted from SEC registration requirements because they are notoffered publicly.   The attraction to private offerings is ``as much a question ofconvenience as anything else,'' said Geoff Vincent, an associate atIDD Information Services.   Paperwork for a public offering takes a minimum of two weeksafter it gets to the SEC, he explained, while in a private offering``you cut out the whole formality of registering with the SEC. Therehas to be some savings on printing expenses and legal costs.''   But there's a catch. While companies can sell their securities tolarge investors without the lengthy and expensive disclosure andregistration proceedings required in public offerings, the purchasermust hold them for two to three years. That restriction has madeprivately placed securities unattractive to many large investors,forcing issuers to sell at a discount.   Rule 144a would create a ``safe harbor'' from the resalerestriction.   ``What we're doing here is providing a more liquid market, makingit more efficient so it's easier to resell them,'' said Ms. Hanks,chief of the SEC's Office of International Corporate Finance.   In response to earlier comments by top officials from majorcorporations and investment institutions, the SEC staff recommendedchanges in its initial proposal.   They included narrowing the number of institutions allowed toparticipate and barring securities that already are publicly tradedfrom the registration exemption.   ``From what we've read about it, we think its better than thelast rule, but whether it's something we completely support, I can'tsay yet,'' said Kenneth Leibler, president of the American StockExchange.   Ms. Hanks noted that the Securities Act of 1933, which Rule 144awould modify slightly, was aimed at protecting investors.   ``Our role is to protect investors when they need protecting,''she said. ``There was clear intent by Congress that there are somepeople who just don't need our protection, the large institutionalinvestors who can fend for themselves.''   Gene Finn, chief economist for the National Association ofSecurities Dealers, which oversees over-the-counter stock dealers,agreed that ``large institutions don't need the protections builtinto many SEC requirements.''   Finn and Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities IndustryAssociation, agreed that the change wouldn't hurt small investorsalthough it favors large institutional investors such as banks,mutual funds and insurance companies.   ``Little guys invest through these investment funds which arelarge investors,'' said Finn, adding that the change will ``lowerthe costs of those financial services. That will indirectly benefitindividual investors.''   ``I don't think it (Rule 144a) is going to impinge on the rightsof individual investors because it will not necessarilly create amarket that will interfere with them,'' O'Brien said.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday July 17</NOTE></DOC>
