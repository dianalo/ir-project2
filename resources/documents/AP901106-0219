LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emerson Electric Co. on Tuesday reported a 3.3percent rise in fourth-quarter profits and record profits for its33rd consecutive year.   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company had net earnings of$154.6 million, or 69 cents a share, up from $149.6 million, or 67cents a share, in last year's final quarter.   Sales were $2.03 billion, up 15.7 percent from $1.76 billion forthe 1989 fourth quarter.   For the year, Emerson had net earnings of $613.2 million, or$2.75 a share, up 4.3 percent from the $588 million, or $2.63 ashare, in fiscal 1989.   Sales for fiscal 1990 increased 7.1 percent, to $7.57 billionfrom $7.07 billion.   ``These results were achieved in a domestic economic environmentthat became increasingly difficult as the year progressed,'' saidCharles Knight, chairman and chief executive officer. ``We view theeconomic outlook for fiscal 1991 with a great deal of caution.''   Knight said the deteriorating economy has hurt the sale ofEmerson's consumer products, such as tools and ceiling fans, alongwith the demand for appliance components and computer equipment.   ``The weakening domestic economy highlighted the internationalstrength of the company as international sales grew by more than 30percent,'' Knight said.   However, Knight cautioned that higher oil prices may makefurther growth in foreign sales more difficult.   Emerson, headquartered in St. Louis, makes electric motors anduninterrupted power supplies and compressors for refrigerators. Italso owns companies that make tools for Sears Roebuck Co., Skilpower tools, ceiling fans, ladders and other consumer products.   In September, the company completed a plan to spin off fivedefense-related subsidiaries into a separate company in order toexit the defense business. Defense products had comprised about 10percent of Emerson's annual sales.</TEXT></DOC>
