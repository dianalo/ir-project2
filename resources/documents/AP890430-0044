Phil Gramm renewed his call Sunday fordeclaration of a ``national crime emergency'' to quickly expandprison facilities and take other measures to help crack down onviolent crime.   ``In America today, we have crime without punishment,'' Grammsaid, noting that while 40,000 people were arrested on felonycharges last year in the District of Columbia, only 1,400 of themwent to prison.   Gramm, appearing on the CBS program ``Face the Nation,''asserted that no matter what else is done to deal with the rootcauses of crime, ``we have got to take violent criminals off thestreets.''   ``Now what we're trying to do is to build more prisons _ 70,000more prison beds,'' said the Texas Republican. ``We want a nationalcrime emergency to allow us to go out on closed military bases,pitch tents, use temporary buildings, put the violent criminals injail and keep them there. And do it now.''   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that ``it's absolutelyridiculous to believe that our first line of defense should bespending the billions of dollars that we are in building jails,without being willing to spend millions of dollars in finding outthe reasons why people have this anti-social behavior.''   Also interviewed on the same program was Peter Reinharz, chiefprosecutor of the Juvenile Court in New York City, where severalteen-agers have been arrested in a brutal attack April 19 on a28-year-old investment banker while she was jogging in Central Park.   ``It's evident that the juvenile justice system, as it presentlystands, has no deterrent effect whatsoever in light of theincreasing nature of the violence and the increasing severity ofthe crimes we've seen over the last several years,'' Reinharz said.   He said that for juvenile offenders ``there's very little threatof jail. So maybe that's one of the things that has to change inorder to bring about some sort of deterrent value.''   Reinharz said he also was particularly concerned about ``theincrease in sex crimes among the very young.''   ``We have 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds committingforcible rape, forcible sodomy, aggravated sexual abuse,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
