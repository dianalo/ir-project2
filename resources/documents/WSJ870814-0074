Brehmer &quot;thought someone who'd accumulated all those years might have gotten something special.&quot; But the &quot;something special&quot; was available only to younger workers -- in the form of a lucrative early retirement offer that he, as a more senior executive, wasn't eligible for.    Now, the 65-year-old former director of Du Pont's Thailand office is among the plaintiffs suing the company on charges that the early retirement program is in effect a form of age discrimination. The resolution of that suit and others like it -- which are only now making their way into the courts -- could have a profound impact on what has become one of corporate America's most widely used tools for pruning its work force.    The debate over whether such incentives are discriminatory is attracting widespread interest as the programs become more commonly used by corporations. Sixteen of the 50 largest industrial companies offered some salaried employees early retirement programs last year, according to a survey by Wyatt Co., a consulting firm; only six of the same group offered such programs in 1985.    The trend is likely to be reinforced by new laws that this year outlaw mandatory retirement and next year compel employers to continue contributing to pension plans for workers over age 65. As a result, &quot;this will be the only option left for employers who want to encourage retirement,&quot; says Paul Brenner, a staff lawyer with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Washington. &quot;So these incentive plans have become the hottest age-discrimination issue around.&quot;    To advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, which is a plaintiff in the Du Pont case and has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a similar suit against the North Tonawanda, N.Y., school system, programs that offer bonuses or added pension benefits only to workers under a certain age are a clear violation of federal laws against age discrimination.    &quot;People seem to feel that the older worker will retire soon anyway and that the company shouldn't have to give them the lump-sum payments offered to somewhat younger workers,&quot; says Cyril Brickfield, executive director of AARP. &quot;But basing things like that on age is wrong.&quot;    Adds Christopher Mackaronis, manager of advocacy programs for the association: &quot;If a company just wants to reduce the size of its work force, what difference does the age of the departing person make?&quot; Age-based retirement incentives, he says, are based on an assumption that a younger person will stay with the company longer than an older one. The AARP claims studies show that assumption to be erroneous in a modern, mobile society.    Moreover, the association says, federal age-discrimination law requires employers to provide workers with equal benefits except when they can show there are special age-related costs, such as higher insurance premiums.    But employers who have offered early retirement programs say they don't reflect an effort to discriminate, because workers excluded from the plans still receive all the retirement benefits to which they are legally entitled. Rather, the companies say, the plans represent a legal and humane way to avoid layoffs while allowing younger employees to share in the relatively greater cost savings that come from their early departures.    &quot;Companies really need some flexibility in handling their work force,&quot; argues Mark Ugoretz, executive director of the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents companies on pension and benefit issues. &quot;They're pressed by economic forces on the one hand, and state and federal benefit mandates on the other, both of which increase the cost of employment.&quot;    Because each company's early retirement offer is different, and lawsuits challenging them are no further than the early stages of litigation, the legal issues involved are murky and unresolved.    One closely watched case involves two North Tonawanda, N.Y., teachers who sued the school board in 1981 in federal district court in Manhattan charging that the plan constituted an arbitrary denial of benefits to them in violation of federal age discrimination law. Sarah Cipriano and Jeune Miller were protesting the offer of a $10,000 retirement bonus only to teachers who hadn't reached the age of 61 by September 1981. Both women were 61 when the offer was made. They were even more angered when the incentive program was supported by their union as part of the next year's contract, and they have also sued the North Tonawanda United Teachers.    Under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, a retirement plan isn't illegal if the employer can show that the plan &quot;is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes&quot; of the law. Lawyers for the school board in the North Tonawanda case argue that their program wasn't such a &quot;subterfuge.&quot; Among other things, they say, because the program was voluntary, it couldn't have been intended to be discriminatory. Rather, says the school board's lawyer, the program was a humane way to avoid teacher layoffs.    In 1985, a federal district judge in Manhattan sided with the board, ruling that the the program &quot;could not be a subterfuge because it is strictly optional with the employees.&quot; Last year, however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's judgment and sent the case back. The appellate court ruled that there is a &quot;fairly heavy burden on the employer to justify any age-based distinctions in employee benefit plans on the basis of 'age-related cost justifications.'&quot;    The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will file a friend of the court brief this month arguing that, while each program must be judged separately, voluntary early retirement plans in general are lawful and companies needn't offer all employees the same benefits under such plans. The agency also will say that employers can limit the offer to a specific age group so long as it has a legitimate business reason to do so -- although it's not yet clear what would constitute such a reason. Commission lawyers say they expect the court decision in the North Tonawanda case to set a precedent for challenges to a host of other retirement-incentive plans currently before the agency.    In the Du Pont case, the company's standard retirement plan tied benefits to an employee's age and years of service. Under the program, a worker who chose to retire early was considered -- for benefits purposes -- to have been with the company for five more years and as being five years older than he really was. The offer excluded employees over 70 as well as those with more than 40 years of service.    &quot;We know these incentives are being used more often to cut the work force,&quot; says Raymond Fay, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who filed their suit last November in federal district court in Pennsylvania. &quot;But our theory in this case is that this is a benefit the employer didn't have to offer, but once he does, it can't be doled out in a discriminatory manner.&quot;    George Palmer, a Du Pont spokesman, argues workers had the choice of staying or leaving and that employees who are 65 or 70 years old and have been with a company for 40 years aren't, by definition, targets of an early retirement program.    The various legal challenges, among other things, apparently have prompted some companies to reconsider early retirement programs. Ward Kallstron, chairman of an American Bar Association panel on benefits, says some companies also are beginning to see &quot;hidden costs&quot; in such programs: younger retired workers who aren't eligible for Medicare and remain enrolled in the company's health-insurance plan; the need to train junior employees who don't know the duties previously handled by early retirees; sometimes even the cost of hiring former workers as consultants. &quot;Once you've made the offer, you can sometimes lose the wheat with the chaff,&quot; Mr. Kallstron says.    But many employers still say the benefits of such plans outweigh their liabilities. They say the programs help prevent their companies from becoming top-heavy with older, higher-paid workers, and that encouraging early retirement helps clear an upward path for younger workers.    And some say population trends eventually will provide proof that early retirement programs are driven by demographics rather than discrimination. &quot;A lot of companies are expecting worker shortages as the baby-boom generation moves along,&quot; says Mr. Ugoretz of the ERISA Industry Committee. &quot;They know that, eventually, they'll be looking for ways to keep experienced personnel working. Then, even if someone is 70, if he's breathing and can push a pencil, he can work.&quot;    ---                       Taking the Option   In 40% of early retirement plans, no more than half of theeligible employees accepted the company's offer.
