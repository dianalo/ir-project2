Paul Simon met today withSouth African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, and the two men said theyaired their differences over apartheid without yelling at eachother.   ``You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,''said Simon, D-Ill., who favors U.S. economic sanctions againstSouth Africa. ``We had a good, frank discussion.''   Simon, who unsuccesfully campaigned for the Democraticnomination for the presidency this year, is on a five-day,fact-finding tour of South Africa.   Simon is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommitteeon African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations onpending legislation to intensify U.S. sanctions against SouthAfrica.   Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986.   ``We never yelled at each other,'' Botha said after the meetingin a Johannesburg suburb. ``The senator has put all the difficultquestions. But he has given me the opportunity to put my side.That's all I can ask.''   Botha and other South African leaders say they are pursuinggradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured bysanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer themost from any economic hardships caused by sanctions or foreigndisinvestment.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   Simon predicted Wednesday that Congress would intensifysanctions against South Africa unless the government agreed to atimetable for dismantling apartheid.   ``(Simon) came here determined to find justification forsanctions,'' The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said in aneditorial today.   ``But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should wesay a Simple Simon _ approach to other countries, and South Africais probably the worst example of this American madness to recreatecountries in their own image,'' the newspaper said.   Simon visited several black townships and met with black leaderssuch as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.   The senator's request to meet with imprisoned African NationalCongress leader Nelson Mandela was rejected by the government.   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader,is in Cape Town's Tygerberg Hospital being treated for tuberculosis.</TEXT></DOC>
