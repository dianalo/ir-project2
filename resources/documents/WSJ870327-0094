The agency voted 4-1 to end the rules in five years, even though a host of lawmakers and broadcasting trade groups had lobbied strenuously for permanent rules.    At the same time, the agency scaled back a plan requiring cable-TV operators to provide their customers, free of charge, with switching devices so they could choose between shows carried on cable TV and those received by antenna. By a 5-0 vote, the agency said cable-TV operators could charge for the switches and, in most cases, installation, and need only provide them to consumers who request them.    FCC Chairman Mark Fowler said the rules had to be ended in five years to protect the constitutional rights of cable-TV operators. In 1985, a federal appeals court struck down the so-called must-carry rules, which required cable-TV systems to carry all broadcast signals in their franchise areas. Then, last August, the FCC adopted a narrower set of requirements, which gave broadcasters limited access to cable-TV systems for five years.    FCC Commissioner James Quello alone voted against eliminating the rules. &quot;Let's not kid ourselves,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a certain congressional threat saying you'd better do this or we'll legislate it.&quot;    The reaction among legislators and broadcasters was swift and angry. &quot;Today's decision was outrageous,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey, (D., Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee. &quot;FCC dogmatism might drive Congress to legislate.&quot; John Summers, a top lobbyist for the National Association of Broadcasters, said the group might seek to attach a provision to an FCC authorization bill making the rules permanent.    But Rep. Al Swift (D., Wash.), who also opposed the FCC action, said it would be difficult for Congress to craft permanent must-carry rules. &quot;You have a pile-on problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone would want an exemption, and the cable industry would be able to kill it.&quot;    For its part, the National Cable Television Association praised what it called the FCC's &quot;wisdom&quot; in modifying its plan for the switching device. The association had estimated that providing the switches would have cost the industry $1.4 billion, a figure the FCC considers inflated.    It is expected, however, that the FCC ruling will be quickly appealed. Diane Killory, the FCC's general counsel, said the appeals court probably would throw out the rules if they were made permanent. Bruce Fein, a conservative former FCC general counsel, predicted that the appeals court will throw out the rules anyway because the agency hasn't demonstrated that they are necessary to protect broadcasters.    Mr. Summers said he worries that the court will bar the must-carry rules until the court challenges are resolved, a process that could take several years. &quot;That would be a disaster,&quot; he said.    Broadcasters argue that if cable-TV companies don't carry broadcasting stations into the 43 million homes that are wired for cable -- about half of all U.S. homes with television sets -- the stations ultimately will lose their audience. &quot;The effect of eliminating the rules will be to pull the plug on the public television system,&quot; said Peter Fannon, president of the National Association of Public Television Stations.    Separately, the FCC ruled that computerized communications networks should remain deregulated. The FCC had been deciding whether to re-regulate these discount networks, which carry computer transmissions, because the regional Bell telephone companies claim they were at a competitive disadvantage.    Companies such as US Sprint Communications Co.'s Telenet subsidiary said that if they were re-regulated they would be subject to certain telephone connection charges that would vastly increase their rates. The FCC didn't order such access charges yesterday, but it said it still was considering whether to apply them to the computer networks. US Sprint is a joint venture of United Telecommunications Inc. and GTE Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
