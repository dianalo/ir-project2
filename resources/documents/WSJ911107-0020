The Fed dropped its discount rate to 4.5% from 5% and cutthe federal funds rate to 4.75% from 5%. Together, the movesprompted banks to cut their prime lending rates to 7.5% from8%. Other interest rates are likely to fall as well.</LP><TEXT>   The action followed a meeting Tuesday of the Fed's policycommittee, during which officials talked at length about thepessimism that has gripped the U.S. economy, according tosome who attended. They noted the sharp drop in consumerconfidence in October, as well as the sour attitude of manybusiness executives, including those who sit on the boards ofthe 12 district Federal Reserve Banks.   In response to that crisis of confidence, Fed officialsdecided to take more dramatic action than usual, to give apsychological kick to the economy. The effect was amplifiedby the fact that it came just one week after the centralbank's previous credit-easing move, when it cut the federalfunds rate to 5% from 5.25%.   The federal funds rate is the interest rate that bankscharge on loans to each other, and broadly influences othershortterm interest rates. The discount rate is the rate theFed charges on loans to financial institutions, and isimportant largely for its symbolic value.   The Fed's move won quick praise within the Bushadministration, which has been leaning on the Fed toreinvigorate the slumping economy. Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady, in particular, has argued that Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan's practice of lowering the federal funds rateby only a quarter of a percentage point every five or sixweeks has diminished the impact of the Fed's easing moves.   &quot;Lower interest rates will provide stimulus for economicgrowth, spur incentives for business investment and increaseconsumer confidence,&quot; Mr. Brady said.   Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,called the Fed's action &quot;a responsible move in the rightdirection.&quot; He said &quot;people will be much more aware of thisthan some of the other moves in the funds market thatcumulatively do have an impact, but have not had as big anannouncement effect.&quot;   In a news release, the Fed cited &quot;sluggish expansion ofmonetary and credit aggregates&quot; as a reason for its cut inthe discount rates. It also noted that recent statisticssuggest inflation may be on the decline.   How much the moves will help the economy is unclear. Bylowering mortgage rates, they should give a boost to thehousing market, although home sales recently have beenremarkably sluggish despite the lowest interest rates in 14years.   In addition, the clear public signal that the Fed iscommitted to boosting the economy may provide a lift toconsumer and business confidence.   The latest action comes after a week of intense debatewithin the Federal Reserve. Last Wednesday, the members ofthe Fed's policy committee held a lengthy telephoneconference in which they discussed further credit-easingmoves. In a switch, the 12 district Fed bank presidents, whoa year ago were the most reluctant to ease credit, made themost forceful arguments for further rate-cutting moves. Butsome of the Fed governors in Washington, including WayneAngell and John LaWare, resisted moves toward easier credit.   That telephone conference was still going on when the timecame for the Fed's daily market operations, which usuallyoccur shortly before noon. Unclear what decisions thecommittee would make, the Fed officials in New York who runthe market operations declined to take any action. Becausethe federal funds rate was already trading below its previoustarget of 5.25%, many traders took that inaction as a signthe Fed had already eased credit.   Later that day, faced with a market that believed thecentral bank had already cut rates, Mr. Greenspan decided touse his discretion to do just that, lowering his federalfunds target to 5% from 5.25%.   The federal funds rate is controlled by the entire FederalOpen Market Committee, which includes the 12 district bankpresidents as well as the five Fed governors in Washington.The discount rate is controlled by the governors alone. Gov.Angell dissented from yesterday's action. Gov. LaWare, whohad previously expressed his misgivings, voted for it.   The central bank received some criticism from markettraders for making its move in the midst of the Treasury'squarterly refunding operations. Steven Woods, a Fed analystat Bank of America, said the central bank caused the Treasuryto pay an additional $70 million in interest by not movingbefore Tuesday's three-year note sale.   But a Fed spokesman said the central bank couldn't havemoved in time for Tuesday's auction because its policycommittee meeting took up most of the day on Tuesday. He saidthe committee concluded it would be better to move Wednesday,and perhaps lower rates for part of the Fed auction, than towait until the entire refunding had been concluded.
