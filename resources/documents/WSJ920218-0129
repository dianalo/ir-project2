Companies driven by recessionary pressures orrestructuring plans are beefing up options such as part-timework, job sharing, telecommuting and parenting leaves. Manysuch efforts are promoted as family-friendly to workingparents.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The conventional wisdom is flexibility doesn't advanceduring hard times,&quot; says Paul Rupert, associate director ofNew Ways to Work, a San Francisco research group. &quot;But inthis recession more than in previous ones, companies aresaying flexibility can be used to help cushion the effects ofthe downturn.&quot;   Yet the paradox is that even as companies are making iteasier to get such jobs, there are often few takers in thisweak economy. As layoffs sweep the country, reaching deepinto the professional and managerial ranks, employees areafraid to give up anything. Thus, workers cling to full-timejobs, no matter what the toll is on family lives.   Du Pont Co., already a pacesetter in offeringfamily-friendly benefits, stepped up efforts to pitch them toemployees after instituting a $1 billion cost-trimming effortlast summer. The company has about 2,000 employees workingpart-time and between 10,000 and 15,000 working flexiblehours. But only &quot;a couple of hundred&quot; more employees haveopted for flexible options since the push started lastsummer, estimates Susan Pierce, consultant to Du Pont'sso-called work force partnering division. &quot;We have not seenmuch interest by employees, frankly, because of theuncertainty of the economy,&quot; she says.   Nevertheless, family assistance is growing even ascompanies struggle to contain overall benefits costs.According to a new survey by Hay/Huggins Co., benefitsconsultants, virtually none of the surveyed firms hadpaternity leave or work-at-home policies in 1987. By 1991,nearly half offered paternity leaves and 14% offeredtelecommuting options. In addition, 40% had flexible-hourspolicies, up from 35% in 1987.   Donna Shaw, a 40-year-old business reporter for thePhiladelphia Inquirer, recently took advantage of an offer byher employer to start a four-day work week. She wanted tospend more time with her two children and also allow herhusband, a Philadelphia police detective, to devote more timeto his job. The couple hope to balance her loss of incomeagainst his increased overtime earnings.   Ms. Shaw says her worries that the move could hurt hercareer were softened by the company's positive attitude aboutthe plan. &quot;They made it clear that it wouldn't be seen asnegative, that this was a way for you to help your company,&quot;she says.   Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the subsidiary ofKnight-Ridder Inc. that publishes the Philadelphia Inquirerand Philadelphia Daily News, recently offered a specialpackage of voluntary programs to reduce costs. Employees wereencouraged to sign up for reduced work-week schedules, jobsharing and unpaid leaves of absence, along with the morestandard fare of early retirement and voluntary separationincentives. The company sweetened the deal by extendinghealth benefits up to the length of a year's leave.   Among 1,190 union employees at the Philadelphia Inquirerand Daily News, 59 employees took unpaid leaves, 12 tookreduced work weeks and none applied for job sharing. Among630 nonunion employees, 10 are taking unpaid leaves and fourare switching to reduced work weeks. The company recentlyannounced there would be no layoffs in the foreseeable futurebecause of the success of the voluntary program.   At Du Pont, officials are actively promoting the company'smenu of work options to seek increased participation. In aletter laying out the cost-cutting drive to Du Pont's 141,000world-wide employees, Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr.personally endorsed a &quot;combination of positive, creativeapproaches&quot; such as shared work to help achieve costreductions. And for the past several months, Ms. Pierce hasbeen making presentations about flexible work to supervisoryand employee groups.   &quot;We have widely communicated that flexible work practicesare an alternative for avoiding layoffs and keeping valuedemployees while going through current cost-cuttingactivities,&quot; she says.   In the midst of a big drive to reduce its work force,International Business Machines Corp. also has expandedseveral family programs -- not as another cost-cutting stepbut as part of a strategic plan to hold onto its bestemployees.   A new &quot;flexible work leave of absence&quot; program allowsemployees to work part-time for up to three years with fullcompany-paid benefits, and they can continue the arrangementafter the third year by paying part of the benefit costs. Thecompany also expanded its work-at-home program, flexible workschedules and &quot;meal break&quot; option, which lets employeesrearrange their workday to attend a child's school functionor meet other family and personal needs.   Avon Products Inc. is another company turning to flexiblescheduling to attract and keep the best-qualified workers.Toward that end, the company recently revived the dormant jobof managing family and diversity issues in its work force andbegan generating more programs.   &quot;To achieve a competitive advantage, it's essential thatyou manage people and life situations more effectively,&quot; saysVicky Cintron, who took over the family-issues job last June.&quot;You can't deal with a work force that's consistently worriedabout child care.&quot; The company is launching a new child-careassistance plan and exploring flexible work options.   Certainly, many companies going through hard times arestill the lean and mean variety. But a study by the Familiesand Work Institute found that contrary to stereotype,companies experiencing big business changes such asdownsizing were more involved with work-family assistancethan those not going through such changes.   Some workplace and union experts charge that such movescould actually be a ploy by companies to replace costlyfulltime jobs with inferior part-time work offering fewbenefits and little job security. Philadelphia NewspaperGuild Local 10 fought some provisions of the PhiladelphiaNewspapers proposal. &quot;We believe the ultimate aim is tocreate a part-time work force and felt this was a backdoorway at getting at that,&quot; says Kitty Caparella, president ofthe local.   Charles Fancher, Philadelphia Newspapers' vice presidentfor communications, contends that is &quot;simply not the case. Wedid not want to go to layoffs if we could possibly avoidthat, and this seemed to be a creative and highly desirableway to approach the situation,&quot; Mr. Fancher says.   One newspaper employee who took a four-month leave ofabsence to write a children's book and spend more time withhis own children did so only after he &quot;sat down with acalculator&quot; to figure out if it was financially possible.   Joe Logan, a 40-year-old features writer for the Inquirer,calculated that he could save $250 a week by serving as hischildren's after-school child-care program himself. Inaddition, he figured savings on transportation, lunches andcleaning work clothes. &quot;I'm also lucky that my wife is alawyer,&quot; he says. Indeed, she used his time home to spendmore time working on making partner at her firm.   Mr. Logan says he also felt liberated from career fears bythe company's encouragement. &quot;Previously if you wanted totake a leave, you had to go hat in hand and make a case,&quot; hesays, adding: &quot;I came back refreshed with a sort of newappreciation of the job. They got back a better employee.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
