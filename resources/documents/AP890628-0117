The government says the crackdown by thousands of troops marchingon Beijing was necessary to crush a small group seeking to overthrowthe leadership.   The most recent example of reporting anti-government views andthen dismissing them came Wednesday in the newspaper EconomicReference, which told of a Shanghai man who said the bloodstains onhis shirt came from Tiananmen Square, where he said 26,000 peoplewere killed.   Geng Xiuliang told people on a street corner in Shanghai on June5 that he saw a 3-year-old boy shot six times when soldiers backedby tanks drove student protesters and their supporters from thesquare.   Geng, a 36-year-old worker at a metal factory, tried to sell theshirt as a ``historic object'' for the equivalent of about $13.50,the newspaper said.   Police stopped Geng, who admitted he was not at Tiananmen on June3-4, but with a friend in Shanghai where they killed a dog and ateit for supper, the newspaper said.   It quoted Geng as saying the bloodstains actually came from thedog. The paper did not say whether Geng was punished.   In another case, the magazine Beijing Review this week gaveastonishingly prominent play to anti-government posters put up atChinese universities early on in the seven weeks of student-leddemonstrations.   ``Is there any reason for the existence of socialism?'' askedone. Another declared: ``Right from the beginning, everything theCommunist Party has done is corrupt, autocratic and traitorous. TheCommunist Party has nothing good.'' The magazine published excerptsfrom posters that described the party as ``just another group ofautocrats in power in China's thousand-year-old feudal despotism,''and said it was ``rampant with profiteering officials, full ofcorruption and degeneration and collapsing morality.''   But the point of reproducing the posters, the Beijing Reviewsaid, was to show how a ``few people stir up turmoil by making useof all the well-meaning aspirations of the broad masses of students,by making use of the same people's confused thinking, by making useof some failings in the work of the party and government.''   One of the best-known instances of authorities publicizinganti-government views is the case involving video footageintercepted from the ABC News.   Shown across China, the tape shows a man animatedly describinghow 20,000 people were shot and crushed to death in the army'sattack on Tiananmen Square.   News announcers urged the public to report the ``rumormonger'' topolice, and within 24 hours the man had been spotted and turned into authorities in Dalian, a coastal city east of Beijing.   The government says fewer than 300 people, half of them soldiers,were killed when the army marched on Beijing. Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence reports say up to 3,000 people, most civilians,died.   State-controlled media have singled out the Voice of America forallegedly spreading rumors and interfering in China's politics bybroadcasting reports Beijing considers inflammatory.   The Chinese media have noted the VOA quoted Taiwan news reportsthat senior leader Deng Xiaoping had died or was seriously ill, andthat civil war was imminent in the days after the crackdown began.   Many news organizations reported that apparent infighting withinthe military indicated civil war was possible, but Chinese criticismwas directed at the VOA.   ``If the VOA reports aren't rumormongering, then what is?'' aRadio Beijing news announcer said.</TEXT></DOC>
