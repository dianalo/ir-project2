Bork was backwhen they held a confirmation hearing for the most controversialjudicial nominee before them.   Bernard Siegan, nominee for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals, spent his confirmation hearing Thursday defending what onesenator called his ``remarkably extreme views.'' Bork did the sameduring confirmation hearings on his Supreme Court nomination.   And like Bork, Siegan pledged over and over that he would casthis personal constitutional views aside if confirmed, and followSupreme Court precedent.   So did Bork.   The players were the same, too, in the Senate JudiciaryCommittee hearing room.   Liberal Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Patrick J.Leahy, D-Vt., both major opponents of Bork, were highly critical ofSiegan, a 63-year-old professor of constitutional law at theUniversity of San Diego.   Conservative Sens. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Charles Grassley,R-Iowa, two of Bork's most ardent backers, jumped to Siegan'sdefense.   And People For The American Way, the civil libertian group thatran a controversial anti-Bork television spot narrated by GregoryPeck, promptly issued a news release attacking Siegan.   Siegan, the group said, ``spent the morning distancing himselffrom his entire body of legal scholarship.''   Siegan's views do not always parallel those of Bork, but he isjust as controversial.   He wrote that the Supreme Court reached the right conclusion inoutlawing school segregation but used faulty reasoning. He saidprayer in schools could be constitutional, although the SupremeCourt has said otherwise. He gave equal weight to property rightsand human rights. And he said the framers of the 14th Amendment,which governs due process rights, never intended its scope to be asbroad as that defined by the Supreme Court.   Leahy _ who conducted the confirmation hearing because committeeChairman Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., is recuperating from brainsurgery _ said afterward that Siegan's almost total lack ofexperience in the courtroom and his ``remarkably extreme views''make him ``one of the more difficult ones for the Senate toapprove.''   ``The last time you were in federal court I was 12 years old,''Leahy said.   Asked about Siegan's promises to follow Supreme Court precedent,Leahy said, ``There is a feeling there may be a confirmationconversion here, too.''   The senator used the same term during Bork's hearing, accusingthe nominee of changing many of his controversial positions inorder to win confirmation. Bork proved to be unconvincing, and theSenate rejected his nomination 58-42.   ``In many ways Bork would be easier to accept because he hadjudicial experience and federal court experience,'' Leahy said.   During the hearing, Hatch listed many of Siegan's controversialwritings, and repeatedly gave the nominee the chance to say hewould ``observe the law of the land'' and resign if unable to do so.   ``I hope people will give you a fair shake,'' Hatch said.   The 9th circuit, on which new Supreme Court justice AnthonyKennedy served, covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho,Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern MarianaIslands.   Siegan told the committee: ``There are times I will rulecontrary to my own feelings. It would be a direct violation andcontrary of my oath to push my position ahead of the SupremeCourt.''   Metzenbaum told Siegan, ``I'm concerned that if confirmed, youwill find a way to implement your views. Circuit courts are oftenthe courts of last resort.'' He said there would be a ``greatrisk'' if the Senate confirmed Siegan.   Siegan said his lack of courtroom experience would not be aproblem, commenting: ``A circuit court judge is given scholarlyduties to see if what the lower court did was right. I have spent20 years of my life in scholarly activities. Even a lawyer withtrial experience may not know how to write an opinion.''</TEXT></DOC>
