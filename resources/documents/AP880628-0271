A First RepublicBank internal memo distributed Monday indicatesthat about 20 Citicorp officials are examining First RepublicBank'sbooks and financial condition. Citicorp officials, though, havedeclined to comment.   First RepublicBank, the largest bank-holding company in Texas,received a $1-billion bailout earlier this year from the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. The bank has been plagued by sour realestate loans.   The Citicorp visit was arranged by the FDIC, which says it isnegotiating with a number of parties interested in acquiring FirstRepublicBank with federal assistance.   First RepublicBank Chairman Albert Casey told company employeesin the memo that several banks have ``expressed interest in FirstRepublicBank to the FDIC. One of those organizations is NewYork-based Citicorp.''   But the Dallas Morning News reported Monday that one bank hasmaintained a serious interest in acquiring First RepublicBank, andsome First Republic insiders told the Dallas Times-Herald that totheir knowledge Citicorp is the first bank to take an in-depth lookat the bank holding company.   Along with the Citicorp team, 80 examiners from the FDICdivision of liquidation also are looking at First RepublicBank'sbooks.   The FDIC says it expects to act shortly on the FirstRepublicBank rescue and has set a June 30 deadline for potentialacquirers to submit their bids.   Citicorp and First RepublicBank, if combined, would form one ofthe 10 largest bank holding companies in the world.</TEXT></DOC>
