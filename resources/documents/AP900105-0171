Gorbachev put off meetingswith foreign guests Friday to concentrate on domestic crises, andnews of it unsettled Wall Street and caused a steep decline in theTokyo stock market.   Among the foreign visitors affected was Neil Kinnock, leader ofthe opposition socialist Labor Party in Britain. A senior CommunistParty official said privately Gorbachev was dealing with borderriots in Azerbaijan and the breakaway Communist Party of Lithuania.   Soviet media did not report the schedule change, but it was feltabroad.   The Tokyo Stock Exchange recorded its sharpest drop since Oct.16, plummeting 438.12 points.   Analysts blamed concern about Gorbachev's fate. A slight declinein stock prices on Wall Street and a steep drop on the Hong Kongexchange were attributed to the same cause.   ``To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the worldscenario would be for Gorbachev to drop from sight,'' ChrisSchreiber, an investment analyst with New Japan Securities, said inTokyo.   The market reactions illustrated how closely the capitalistworld links Gorbachev to the success of the reforms and improvedEast-West relations he has pursued since gaining power in March1985.   In London, Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave said onChannel 4 News: ``It is in our interests that current Sovietforeign policy should be maintained, and we should thereforerespond imaginatively and positively to what he is trying to do.   ``He is going in the right direction and we want him to survive.He still dominates the political scene. He has shown himselfwilling to be open to new ideas.''   The party official in Moscow asked about Western news reportsthat Gorbachev had postponed meetings with Kinnock and otherforeign dignitaries, replied: ``It's right. We have many problemsright now.''   He mentioned disturbances in Azerbaijan along the Iranian borderand the Lithuanian Communist Party's decision to break away fromthe ruling national party led by Gorbachev.   Soviet Azerbaijanis tried over the New Year's holiday to forceopen the frontier and reunite with their ethnic brethren in Iran,tearing down guard towers and prompting the KGB to reinforcesecurity along the frontier. Fences remain flattened and otherbarriers out of commission along the border, Soviet TV reportedFriday night.   Gorbachev is expected to travel to Lithuania next week on amission from the national party's Central Committee to try to mendthe rift with the Lithuanian Communists. They voted two weeks agoto split off from the 20 million-member ruling party and pursuelocal independence, and Lithuanian party leaders who met withGorbachev for five hours Thursday said he failed to sway them fromtheir decision.   A dissenting faction of Lithuanian Communists who voted toremain loyal to Moscow were on their way to the capital Friday tomeet with party leaders, said Eduardas Potashinskas, a LithuanianTV journalist.   Meanwhile, the Estonian Communist Party threw its support to theLithuanians in the dispute with Moscow, reports said Friday. TheEstonian party's Central Committee meeting Thursday set March 23for a session of its own full congress, which is expected to voteon a similar proposal to split from the Soviet party, Estonianjournalist Tarmu Tammerk said.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, in a telephoneinterview, would neither confirm nor deny that Gorbachev wasputting aside foreign questions to concentrate on domestic problems.   Asked about a report from London that the Soviet ambassador toBritain, Leonid Zamyatin, had told Kinnock that Gorbachev waspostponing a Jan. 16 meeting with Kinnock and all other contactswith foreign politicians this month, Gerasimov replied: ``Has thismeeting been planned? Let The Associated Press compose its owncommentary. For me this is all clear. Let them comment on that asthey wish.''   Gorbachev's calendar is rarely made public, and whenever hedisappears from the public eye, speculation about his activitiesand even his health becomes rife. He scoffed at suchrumor-mongering this summer at the first session of the Congress ofPeople's Deputies.   ``Let's end these rumors,'' he said. ``In four years, I havealready died seven times and my family was killed three times.''   Gorbachev, 58, was last seen on state-run TV on Dec. 31delivering a taped address to the nation. Moscow-based officialmedia did not report on his closed-door meeting Thursday with theLithuanians.   In London, a Labor Party spokesman said Zamyatin had delivered apersonal message from Gorbachev to Kinnock, who had been scheduledto visit Moscow for talks with the Soviet leader. The message saidthe meeting had to be postponed because ``political events in theSoviet Union'' required Gorbachev's ``personal attention andparticipation,'' and that he was ``postponing contact with foreignpoliticians scheduled for January.''</TEXT></DOC>
