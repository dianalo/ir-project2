The German aidorganization Cap Anamar sent 80,000 aid packages to St.Petersburg last month, of which 40,000 have been stolen byRussian officials and 30,000 are being hoarded in warehouses.Organization head Rupert Neudeck told the newspaper Die Welt,&quot;There are two greedy octopuses covering the whole of Russiawith their tentacles and their huge stomachs -- the oldSoviet army and the new mafia, which is made up of hundredsof thousands of parasitic party functionaries.&quot;   Over in Moscow, most of the donated food is also missing,according to the city's economics minister, Larissa Piasheva.Three hundred baggage handlers at Moscow airport were firedfor &quot;dishonesty&quot; last year. A Mercedes-Benz truck sent byGermany last fall to distribute aid has never been used.</LP><TEXT>   Foreign donors have taken heroic but futile measures tokeep the distribution process as honest as possible. EC andRed Cross officials furiously deny that massive amounts ofaid are going astray, but some Western experts have estimatedthat as much as 90% of the aid is misdirected, and Russianstend to say that government aid in particular gets stolen.   Charitable donors are dismayed of course, but these giftsare as much politics as charity. Food is being channeled topolitically sensitive Moscow and St. Petersburg to head offany unrest. Russian politicians complain that the aid propsup the current city administrations at the expense of thepolitical opposition, and they are right.   The intent is not so much to fend off starvation as tolower black-market prices by boosting supply. On one level,then, it doesn't matter if the donations are stolen,providing they hit the market either through official orprivate channels. The effect on the market price is the same.   But apparently Russian black marketeers, likeprotectionists in capitalist nations, are trying to do whatthey can to keep prices from dropping. Consider the curiousrecent episode over a British beef shipment. Britain donated120 tons of beef as part of a food package from the EuropeanCommunity. Russian bureaucrats blocked the shipment on thetrumped-up grounds that it might have madcow disease. ECofficials issued assurances that the beef was safe, but theRussian officials still wouldn't let the shipment through.Soldiers who had been charged with offloading the meatstarted stealing it, and armed police had to be called.   The best explanation for certain Russian officials'intense desire to keep out foreign beef was implied in arecent editorial in Komsomolskaya Pravda: &quot;Everyone knowsthat the primary goal of the massive shipments of meatproducts from Western Europe was to bring down prices on theblack market. Let those who are well-versed in logic maketheir own conclusions.&quot;   Normal black marketeers are proto-capitalists. But theformer party bureaucrats who are stealing aid shipments arenot. As long as functionaries can make a good living sellingstolen aid they won't have to think about getting a real jobin a privatized shop.   In this way, foreign-aid shipments act as a life-supportsystem for the former nomenklatura. Here as elsewhere in theworld, foreign-aid programs -- which should really be termedgovernment-to-government transfers -- only strengthen acorrupt apparatus, which must perish if a marketplace is todevelop.   If you think that food riots are just around the corner,maybe it is worthwhile to continue the food aid, even if itmeans temporarily boosting the nomenklatura. But we're not sosure that civic unrest is as big a threat in the two flagshipcities as it has been made out to be.   Reports out of Moscow since the price liberalization haveof course focused on the most dramatic complaints. But in thelarge cities there is a good understanding thatliberalization is a necessary ordeal. Most people haveseveral months of supplies laid up; often they have sheds ofhome-grown vegetables in the countryside. The barter systemis still in place, so the ruble price rises don't pack adevastating wallop. The inflation rate was already 450% ayear in any case. The army alone is said to have enough grainto feed the entire Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)for three years, if Mr. Yeltsin can get his hands on it.   The Western conundrum is how to make sure the people arefed while the octopus -- the parasitic apparatus -- starves.Cutting off aid may be necessary. Perhaps aid programscontrolled by foreigners from start to finish, culminating inWestern supermarkets in Moscow, would work if given politicalsanction.   But as long as the most sought after jobs in Moscow arecustoms inspector, airport baggage handler and import licenseofficial, we will know that there is a lot more to theproblem of feeding the former Soviets than simply shippingthem food.</TEXT></DOC>
