Earnings grew to $300,000, or three cents to four cents a share, from $275,000, or three cents a share, in the year-earlier period, Donald E. Steen, president and chief executive officer, said. Medical Care, which operates 32 outpatient surgery clinics in mostly urban areas, said it expects to post revenue for the quarter of $11.5 million compared with $9.1 million.    Mr. Steen said results in the quarter would help make 1986 the five-year-old company's first profitable year. He added that profitability should continue in 1987.    For all of 1986, Medical Care expects to report net of about $1.6 million, or 16 cents to 18 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $6.7 million. It expects to report revenue rose 22% to $42 million from $34.6 million.    The company attributed the improvement to, among other things, the closing of five unprofitable clinics in 1985. In addition, Mr. Steen said its clinics saw a 7% increase in business, a result of private insurance plans that carry strong incentives for outpatient surgery.    Also contributing to profitability was a reduction in corporate expenses, including $800,000 saved from closing the company's Houston operations and consolidating its Dallas offices.    The year-ago quarter included a $260,000 gain on the sale of a certificate of need, a financing tool issued by state governments and sometimes used to finance outpatient centers, among other things. It also included a $6.8 million loss from discontinued operations related to the closing of the five clinics.    Mr. Steen said that Medical Care will buy four to six more outpatient surgical centers in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
