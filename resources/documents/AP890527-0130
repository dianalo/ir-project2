SEIU immediately claimed preeminence in the burgeoning healthcare industry but its rival, the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees, vowed to continue its organizingforays in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy.   Both had campaigned hard for the affiliation of locals now tiedto the National Union of Health Care and Hospital Employees, alsoknown as District 1199, a 30-year-old pioneer in health careorganizing that decided to join a larger union to expand itsfinancial and political clout.   Results of an election supervised by the American ArbitrationAssociation and released Saturday showed 13 of the District 1199's18 locals chose to join SEIU. That would swell the union'smembership from 850,000 to about 900,000.   Five of the locals, with a total of about 27,300 members, votedto join AFSCME, which entered the election 1.2 million membersstrong.   The results left SEIU representing about 375,000 health-careworkers to about 330,000 for AFSCME.   District 1199 Secretary Treasurer Jerome Brown, who sided withSEIU in the affiliation fight, said the election was ``but theopening salvo in a battle to organize all health care workers intoone great union.''   Added SEIU spokesman Gerry Shea: ``We come out of this with alot of energy to turn to the question of unorganized workers.''   But an AFSCME spokesman said SEIU would face continuedcompetition in organizing the estimated 6 million health careworkers not currently represented by unions.   ``We're very pleased to have gotten those votes, to have gainedthose members that we have,'' said AFSCME's Robert Harman. ``Thatmeans we're a very potent health care union too and we intend toremain so.''   The election took on added significance because of a recentNational Labor Relations Board decision unions believe will make iteasier to organize health care workers.   The two larger unions were unable to resolve differences overhow an affiliation vote would be conducted so the AFL-CIO brokereda compromise under which each local of the health care uniondecided which of the bigger unions to join. That decisionessentially guaranteed District 1199 would be split up becauseAFSCME and SEIU had concentrated their lobbying efforts indifferent regions and were competing head-to-head in only a few.   SEIU emerged victorious in two of the hardest fought battles,gaining 5,000 members in the Baltimore area and another 2,500 inMichigan. It also won the affiliation of District 1199 members inNew England _ except for one Connecticut local _ Rome andRochester, N.Y., Washington state, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky,Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania except Philadelphia.   AFSCME's wins included the two largest District 1199 locals, a10,500-member unit in Philadelphia and one representing 10,000workers in New Jersey. About 5,200 California nurses picked AFSCMEover SEIU as did one District 1199 local in Connecticut and anotherrepresenting workers in several Southern states.</TEXT></DOC>
