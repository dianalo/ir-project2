By a 24-23 vote, the House Banking subcommittee on financialinstitutions diluted a requirement to force Sandamp;L owners to backloans with more of their own capital.   The original weakening amendment, sponsored by Reps. FrankAnnunzio, D-Ill., and Stan Parris, R-Va., provided a much looserdefinition of what constitutes capital by including such balancesheet items as goodwill, subordinated debt, deferred loan lossesand mortgage servicing rights.   Then, the subcommittee partly retightened the definition ofcapital regarding subordinated debt and deferred loan losses insubsequent votes of 28-19 and 26-21, respectively.   However, the bill, as written so far, still would allowinstitutions failing to meet the standard to grow by about 7percent to 8 percent a year. The administration wants to barcapital-deficient thrifts from expanding.   ``We've come back some, but we're still concerned that we nothave fictional capital,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary David W.Mullins said after the votes.   ``There are still problems. It is still not as good as the Bushbill, but a small group of Democrats got George Bush his ...capital standards,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who hasbeen supporting the administration position.   The subcommittee, with sessions scheduled Wednesday andThursday, still faced long hours drafting other provisions of thebill, but members agreed the capital standards were the centralreform accompanying President Bush's proposal to spend $50 billionto close or merge failed Sandamp;Ls.   In the original vote to gut the provision, seven Republicansjoined 17 Democrats in supporting the change. They were opposed by11 Democrats and 12 Republicans.   ``It really, really guts this bill. ... I would have to say itsurrenders to the'' U.S. League of Savings Institutions, theindustry's chief lobby group, said Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, told panel members before the vote that``we ought to have a little backbone'' and said Bush would veto anylegislation with weak capital standards.   ``This amendment embraces one more time smoke-and-mirrorsaccounting and smoke-and-mirrors capital,'' said Rep. Henry B.Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee, which willreview the version of the bill that eventually passes thesubcommittee.   Bush wants to increase Sandamp;L capital requirements by June 1991from 3 percent of assets to 6 percent, contending that the morecapital Sandamp;L owners have at risk, the less likely they will be totake undue risks and the greater the buffer standing in front ofthe government deposit insurance fund.   Parris said his amendment, worked out over the weekend by aidesto committee members, was ``absolutely not overgenerous tothrifts.'' He argued that if each element of the capital standardswas separately debated, the end result would be an even weakerbill. However, so far, the individual votes have gone in the otherdirection.   Annunzio said 1,091 solvent Sandamp;Ls, more than a third of theindustry, would fail to meet the administration's capital rules andwould not be allowed to grow.   ``In reality that is a death sentence,'' he said, adding, ``Itmust be pointed out that these 1,100 savings and loan institutionsare not the bad guys. ... Rather, for the most part, these areinstitutions scattered throughout the country that were primarilyengaged in home lending.''   Earlier, the subcommittee adopted, 30-17, a separate weakeningamendment offered by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.   The administration wants to encourage Sandamp;Ls to get out of areassuch as direct investment in real estate, insurance and junk bondsby requiring owners to back those investments entirely with theirown capital. McCollum's amendment exempts healthy thrifts alreadyengaged in those businesses from the stricter standard.   The panel also approved, on a 35-7 vote, a proposal by Rep. DougBarnard, D-Ga., that would protect holding companies that boughtsick Sandamp;Ls last year with the promise of government aid from havingto absorb the costs if those institutions fail because theassistance is cut off.   Barnard said the measure was aimed at preventing other Sandamp;Lsunder a holding company's umbrella from also failing because of agovernment failure to live up to the aid agreements.   Gonzalez complained that the amendment would create a largeloophole for holding companies to skirt any liability if theonce-failed thrifts go under again.   In other decisions, the subcommittee:   _Rejected, 31-14, an amendment by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,D-Mass., proposing a sweeping change in accounting standards.Kennedy would force banks and Sandamp;Ls to value loans at their marketprice, rather than at their original worth. The change would havedrastically altered the balance sheets of big banks with shakyloans to Third World countries.   _Rebuffed on a voice vote an attempt Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,to get states with high numbers of state-chartered thrift failures,such as Texas, California and Florida, to help pay for the bailout.   _Protected the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from politicalinterference by extending, on a voice vote, the terms of boardmembers to eight years and the terms of the chairman and vicechairman to five years.</TEXT></DOC>
