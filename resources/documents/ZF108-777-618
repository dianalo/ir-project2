Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp., and John Perry Barlow,a Wyoming cattle rancher who writes rock song lyrics, recently created theElectronic Frontier Foundation.andM;&quot;There's a huge gap btween where most ordinary people are today and wheretechnology is today,&quot; Kapor said.andP;  &quot;It's our mission to close that gap andcivilize that frontier.&quot;andM;The foundation also will step into the legal and policy arenas becausecomputer users have rights extended to them by the Constitution, Kapor andBarlow said.andM;Electronic bulletin boards, networks and desktop publishing are new forums ofpublic discussion in an emerging technological world.andP;  Barlow said.andP;  Thefoundation's credo relies upon this notion and supports bringing such&quot;speech&quot; under the First Amendment protections.andM;&quot;It's possible to trammel people's rights in the digital media because peopledon't understand what these rights are,&quot; Barlow said.andP;  &quot;We have to recognizethe unique type of space the bulletin board is.&quot;andM;Both men acknowledged the government's legitimate right to investigatesuspected criminal activities, but they questioned the computer literacy ofmany law enforcement officials.andM;Barlow said he had to explain to an FBI agent the intricacies of ROM chipsduring questioning about the suspected theft of Apple Computer Inc. sourcecode.andM;&quot;It's uncomfortable when the suspected perpetrator has to explain to thearrester what's going on,&quot; he said.andM;The foundation will support litigation in cases where it believes thegovernment has abridged a computer user's rights.andM;&quot;It's important to intervene in these cases because precedents are being setthat will affect the digital media for years to come,&quot; Kapor said.andM;Barlow and Kapor both voiced dismay earlier this year over the SecretService's investigation into computer hacking, known as Operation Sun Devil.andO;Their earlier comments about the probe led some observers to speculate thatthe foundation would be a &quot;hackers defense fund.&quot;andM;But the two denied they would support illegal activities undertaken bycomputer users.andM;&quot;Unauthorized entry into computer systems is an improper act and ought to beillegal,&quot; Kapor said.andP;  &quot;We don't see our mission as defending people whobreak into computer systems.&quot;andM;Kapor, Apple co-founder Stve Wozniak, and a third, silent partner donated themoney to start the organization and finance its activities for two years.andO;Kapor described the third contributor as a Silicon Valley computer veteran.andM;Kapor would say only that each of the three made &quot;six-figure donations.&quot;andP;  Thefoundation provided $275,000 of its start-up funds as a grant to ComputerProfessionals for Social Responsibility, a national membership organization.andM;CPSR's Washington-based Computing and Civil Liberties Project will act as thefoundation's educational arm, holding a series of forums and working withcongressional and federal policy-makers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
