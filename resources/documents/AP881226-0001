Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and Virginie Betille, 6, left for Parison a plane, according to Walid Khaled, spokesman for the radicalFatah-Revolutionary Council, headed by the reputed terrorist AbuNidal.   In Paris, the French government said only that it continued to``hope for a speedy release'' of the two girls.   ``It has been indicated to the families, received at the ForeignMinistry on their return from Beirut, that the French government iskeeping up hope for a speedy release and is pursuing its efforts inthis direction,'' a ministry spokesman said.   In Beirut, Khaled told The Associated Press: ``I ask their fatherPascal Betille to be ready with lots of Christmas gifts to reunitewith his daughters.''   He refused to say where the girls were released or to specify theflight they were on. There had been widespread speculation the girlswould be freed in Libya or Algeria.   Libya is Abu Nidal's main backer. Algeria, where the splinterPalestinin faction has bases, had offered its help in returning thegirls to their father.   Betille, who is separated from the girls' mother, JacquelineValente, had spent the weekend in Lebanon along with the girls'grandmother, Brigitte Valente, and another relative.   The three left for Paris on Monday aboard a regular Middle EastAirlines flight. The girls were not aboard that plane.   Fatah-Revolutionary Council said Sunday the girls would be freedas a Christmas gift to the children of the world.   ``I'm disappointed because I am going without my two littledarlings,'' Betille said before leaving Beirut. ``But I am carryingwith me a promise that they are going to be released soon.''   Khaled said earlier the girls had been told of their imminentrelease and that their mother no longer objected. ``They are oldenough and have accepted the coming separation. They are happy. Theydid not cry,'' he said.   In February, Ms. Valente said in a videotaped message released byher captors that she refused to let her daughters go without her.   Khaled released a new set of videotapes of Ms. Valente and thefive Belgian captives Sunday. They said they were being treated welland sent season's greetings to relatives and friends.   The captives did not disclose where they were being held, butsaid the tapes were made Dec. 20. One said they were all living inthe same apartment.   Khaled announced on Nov. 8, 1987 that his group had seized eightFrench and Belgian nationals aboard their French-registered yacht,the Silko, off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council accused them of spying forIsrael. Israel denied it.   Some press reports have said the captives were being held in thesprawling Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of southLebanon's port city of Sidon. Others said they were in Libya.   Ms. Valente gave birth to a baby girl in captivity and is due todeliver again in January, Khaled has said. Since her separation fromBetille, Ms. Valente has been living with Fernand Houtekins, one ofthe five Belgian captives.   The other four catives are Houtekins' elder brother, Emmanuel,Emmanuel's wife, Godelieve and the couple's two children, Laurent,17, and Valerie, 16.   Emmanuel and Godelieve Houtekins paid tribute in the latestvideotaped messages to efforts by King Baudouin of Belgium to securetheir release and urged him to maintain interest in the case.   Khaled confirmed the king had personally intervened throughintermediaries to help resolve the issue.   In addition to the Silko captives, 15 foreign hostages are beingheld in Lebanon: nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian, aBelgian and an Irishman. They are believed held by pro-IranianMoslem fundamentalists.   Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss worker for the International Committeeof the Red Cross, was released Dec. 16 after nearly a month incaptivity. His kidnappers reportedly wanted to trade him for aShiite Moslem hijacker, Hussein Hariri, whose trial begins inSwitzerland in February.   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri el-Banna, formed his group in1976, after splitting from Palestine Liberation Organization. He hassince topped wanted lists across the world for masterminding severalhijackings, bombings and assassinations.</TEXT></DOC>
