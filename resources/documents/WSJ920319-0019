Noble Affiliates Inc., Ardmore, Okla., began talks about45 days ago with a major oil company about buying reservesfor $400 million to $500 million, said Robert Kelley,president and chief executive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The time is right,&quot; Mr. Kelley said in an interview. Themajor oil company, which he wouldn't identify, is currently&quot;in an asset disposition mode.&quot; Many oil companies seek tosell U.S. reserves because of record-low natural gas prices,in addition to a shift in their exploration strategies tointernational areas, where they believe larger oildiscoveries can be made.   &quot;I'm offering anybody a free airline ticket who wants togo overseas,&quot; said George Mitchell, chairman of MitchellEnergy andamp; Development Corp., Woodlands, Texas. In aninterview, Mr. Mitchell said he views the exodus overseas asa buying opportunity, noting his company is &quot;in the marketfor a $100 million acquisition.&quot; He said the company is&quot;working on&quot; an acquisition that could include oil and gasproduction and processing facilities.   Beyond the major oil companies, many smaller companies,ravaged by weak natural-gas prices, are looking to sellproperties or to merge, just to stay afloat. &quot;The next twoyears could be really important for independents if they canget the money to buy properties,&quot; Mr. Mitchell said.   Messrs. Kelley and Mitchell made speeches at a hearingheld here by the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulatesthe state's energy industry. Numerous speakers joined the twomen in bemoaning hard times caused by weak gas prices. Pricesfell below $1 a thousand cubic feet in February in manyplaces. That was 30%-to-50% lower than the year-earlier'sdepressed levels.   &quot;It is critical,&quot; said T. Boone Pickens, chairman of MesaInc. &quot;Something has got to change, or the independentproducer is about to go the route of the carrier pigeon.They're extinct now,&quot; he said.   &quot;Two-thirds of (the industry has) already gone down thetube, and we don't care to go with them,&quot; said Raymond Plank,chairman of Apache Corp. In the face of low gas prices, thesespeakers and others urged Texas regulators to allow companiesto curb the flow of gas from Texas.   Noble's Mr. Kelley said that in today's environment, itmakes more sense to buy reserves than to risk explorationdollars on the chance of finding them. &quot;You can buy reserves. . . at virtually no risk,&quot; he said.   Mr. Kelley said Noble would shift money from itsexploration budget into the possible acquisition. Beyondthat, he said, Noble's healthy balance sheet would allow itto leverage $100 million to $150 million. With interest rateslow, Noble could borrow an additional $50 million to $75million.   The company has talked with potential financial partnersthat would match Noble's cash investment in any acquisition,which could be in the neighborhood of $200 million or more,Mr. Kelley said.   &quot;We think 1992 could be a tough year for the industry, butcould be a heck of a year for us,&quot; Mr. Kelley said.   Last year, Noble had net income of $19.3 million, or 44cents a share, on revenue of $250.4 million. In the yearended Jan. 31, Mitchell Energy earned $44.3 million, or 95cents a share, on revenue of $874.4 million. Both companiessaid they expect first-quarter results to be weaker thanthose of a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
