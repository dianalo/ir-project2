Reebok International Ltd.'s stock rose sharply on rumors that management is considering a leveraged buy-out -- even though Reebok flatly denied the rumors and even though its growth has been slowed lately by stiff competition from resurging Nike Inc.    Moreover, analysts who follow the company expressed skepticism about a leveraged buy-out, and noted that a hostile takeover is unlikely because 47% of the athletic-shoe maker's stock is in friendly hands. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The market wasn't deterred, as Reebok's shares closed at $14.125 a share, up $1.125, in heavy trading of more than four million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Reebok's denial followed rumors that it was discussing a leveraged buy-out at $18 to $20 a share. Though similar rumors about the company have surfaced twice in the past 11 months, the latest flurry was sparked by financial reporter Dan Dorfman, who said in an appearance on CNN Cable TV Tuesday night that there were &quot;solid reports&quot; of a possible leveraged buy-out.    About 15% of the company's shares are owned by Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife, Phyllis. An additional 32% belongs to Pentland Industries PLC, a British shoemaker from whom Reebok was spun off. Only 23% of Reebok shares are owned by institutional investors.    Moreover, Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, Reebok's investment banker, said, &quot;At this point it seems highly unlikely that Reebok would be considering an LBO. If Reebok were considering a deal I wouldn't be at liberty to talk to you right now.&quot;    Edward Johnson, analyst at Johnson Redbook, said this isn't &quot;a propitious time for Reebok to be thinking about going private.&quot; Although still the No. 1 maker of athletic shoes, rival Nike of Beaverton, Ore., is closing in as its sales have taken off. &quot;If (Reebok's) sales are going to be negatively affected, I think it would want to share the poorer performance with its shareholders,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. &quot;Mr. Dorfman has a fairly good batting average making predictions, but he's been wrong at times,&quot; he added.    Reebok had net income of $165.2 million, or $1.49 a share, on sales of $1.39 billion last year, but it has slowed down this year because of inroads by Nike and is expected to post a slight decline in earnings on sales of about $1.8 billion in 1988.    Several analysts also said that Reebok isn't typical of companies that have engaged in leveraged buy-outs. Often, buy-outs involve companies with sizable assets that can be sold off to reduce the debt taken on to finance the buy-out. But Reebok manufactures most of its shoes overseas on contract with foreign producers, and thus doesn't have substantial physical assets; its assets, mostly the shoes it sells, are negligible.    Still, Dennis Rosenberg, an analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said that Reebok has a strong cash flow that could support a leveraged buy-out. Last year, the company had pretax profit of $306 million.    One unanswered question, Mr. Rosenberg added, is &quot;what Pentland may be planning to do with its stake.&quot; In the past 18 months, the British company has reduced its stake in Reebok to 32% from 37%. Pentland officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
