President Augusto Pinochet, the army commander and head of themilitary government, called the vote historic and said it ``hasshown the Chilean people's capacity to reach national unity.''   The armed forces, which have ruled Chile for nearly 16 years,``have vowed in a solmen manner'' to ensure that the constitutionwill be respected by all citizens, he said in a nationallytelevised address.   The government and the opposition support the proposed reforms,which drew little voter interest prior to the balloting.   The government said that with 14,109 of the nation's 23,000polling stations reporting, the referendum was passing by a vote of676,933 to 363,926; 256,687 ballots were invalid or blank.   There were 54 proposed constitutional changes in the packagepresented to the voters.   Andres Zaldivar, president of the centrist Christian DemocraticParty that is the largest opposition group, said the reforms``allow us to begin the construction of a real democracy.''   But he reiterated his position that further reforms are needed.      Delays were reported in the opening of some polling stationsaround the country. Authorities blamed bad weather, especially inthe south, and a lack of public transportation in Santiago and someother cities.   The government reported virtually all of the polls were open bymidmorning. It said voting, slow during the early hours, increasedduring the day and that 80 percent of the eligible voters castballots in some districts.   Voting is mandatory, and citizens who fail to cast a ballot maybe fined more than $90, a steep amount in a country where about athird of the 4.5 million labor force earns the $66 monthly minimumwage.   However, there was little voter interest in the referendum,agreed upon in advance by the government and its foes. Severalsmall political groups opposed it.   Experts said citizens were confused by the long, often highlytechnical text of the amendments.   Among the early voters was Gen. Pinochet, who cast his ballot ata downtown school.   Pinochet, 73, has ruled since a 1973 military coup overthrewelected President Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist.Pinochet agreed to amend the constitution only after voters inOctober rejected a proposal by the military to extend his ruleuntil 1997.   He then called presidential and congressional elections, nowscheduled for Dec. 14. The elected officials are to take officeMarch 11.   The military has said the proposed constitutional changes aim at``improving'' the constitution. The opposition agreed, but calledthe reforms insufficient and said they would seek more changes oncethe new Congress convenes.   The constitution, written by the military government, wasapproved in a 1980 referendum that the opposition considers a fraud.   The proposed changes would ease restrictions on Marxistactivities, which are banned under the present constitution. Thechanges would effectively legalize Marxism, experts say.   Other amendments would make future constitutional amendmentseasier, shorten the presidential term from eight to four years andeliminate the president's power to exile opponents and dissolveCongress.   The opposition, favored to win the congressional elections,wants more changes, including removal of a constitutional clauseallowing Pinochet and his peers in the navy, air force and nationalpolice to remain as commanders until 1998.   Pinochet already has said he plans to remain army commanderafter stepping down from the presidency.</TEXT></DOC>
