The company attributed the projection to &quot;sales levels below previous expectations during recent weeks and generally soft sales trends in the consumer electronics industry as a whole.&quot;    Crazy Eddie also responded to unusually heavy trading volume and market rumors, saying it has no plans to file for protection under the bankruptcy laws.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Crazy Eddie shares closed at 56.25 cents, up 6.25 cents.    The company secured additional bank financing in October and &quot;believes that it is positioned to realize the benefits of Christmas sales&quot; and to meet its revised sales and business plan for fiscal 1989.    In the year-earlier third period, Crazy Eddie had a loss of $73 million on sales of $68.7 million. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the loss was $25.8 million on sales of $88.4 million. The fourth-quarter report was the first since new managers took over the company, however, and Crazy Eddie said then that the new managers believed the fourth-period &quot;figures are inaccurate and should not be relied upon.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
