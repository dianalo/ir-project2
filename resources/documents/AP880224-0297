Trumka said the UMW's executive board voted to rescind itsmerger offer in the wake of Tuesday's OCAW decision.   ``Obviously, I'm quite disappointed by the outcome ... but we'regoing to go back and put it back together and go on,'' he said.   He said the UMW will look for other ways to expand.   Trumka said the apparent sticking point for the OCAW board wasthe UMW's inability to guarantee there would be no dues increasesduring its next regularly scheduled constitutional convention in1990.   Trumka said he cannot control what the delegates will do ``andtherefore I consider it a closed deal.''   The OCAW board voted late Tuesday to reject the merger proposal.   ``There's a decision from OCAW not to go forward,'' spokesmanRod Rogers said late Tuesday night. ``I don't know that that setseverything in concrete. But that's where it stands for now.''   A news conference had been tentatively set for this morning toannounce the merger, but the OCAW backed out after meeting with UMWleaders most of Tuesday afternoon.   The merger would have bolstered the strength of the two energyworkers' unions, whose memberships have been shrinking throughoutthe last decade.   The UMW board has authority to approve a merger without a voteof its full membership, though Rogers said any merger required atwo-thirds majority vote at the OCAW convention in August.   The UMW and the OCAW find themselves negotiating with the samecompanies, ``because the major oil companies own the lion's shareof the energy and coal reserves in the United States,'' Rogers said.   Since 1986, the two unions have been sharing information aboutemployers.   The UMW once had more than 400,000 members, but it now has about85,000 active members _ about two-thirds of the nation's workingminers.   OCAW membership is down by half from a peak of nearly 200,000members in the early 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
