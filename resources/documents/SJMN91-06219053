Jesse Helms, R-N.C., says he was taking the high road when he leaked aSenate ethics committee draft report over the weekend calling for thecensuring of California Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston over his involvement inthe Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan fiasco.;    Asserting that the committee &quot;hasinordinately delayed issuing a report,&quot; despite more than 18 months ofinvestigation, Helms said as he released the report Sunday, &quot;I cannot be aparty to further delay.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HELMS, CRANSTON AT ODDS FOR YEARSPOLITICAL OPPOSITES OFTEN CROSS SWORDS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on page 12A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>      But the history of the relationship between Helms and Cranston suggeststhat Helms' motives are probably not so clear-cut. The two men have been ateach other's throats for so long, no one can remember who started it.;    Helms, the scourge of liberals, is a New Right standard-bearer who roots outfilthy art, excoriates homosexuals, has fought against the Martin Luther Kingholiday and sticks up for repressive right-wing regimes as long as theyprofess to abhor communism.;    Cranston is a charter member of the Old Leftwho has fought for nuclear disarmament, one-world government and a federal GayBill of Rights.;    &quot;Ideologically, they have been on opposite ends of thepole for the last 24 years, but Helms has brought this down to a personallevel, a personal animus that looks like, well, 'hate' is the only word I canthink of,&quot; said Cranston spokesman Murray Flander. &quot;It's uncalled-for inpolitics, it's not the way things work in the Senate and it's not the Americanway of conducting politics.&quot;;    An early example of the hostility between thetwo came during a debate on the Senate floor on July 10, 1985, when Cranstonprovoked Helms with a pointed jab.;    The debate was over sanctions againstSouth Africa, and it typified how far apart they are on almost every issue.Helms, filibustering to prevent the Senate from adopting an economic boycottof South Africa, was defending the white-ruled state on the grounds that theregime was anti-communist and that the American companies doing business therewere hiring lots of blacks.;    &quot;If the senator from North Carolina had beenin the Senate 122 years ago, he probably would have opposed emancipationbecause it would have thrown 4 million slaves out of work,&quot; said Cranston, whowas the floor manager for the economic sanctions legislation.;    The war wason.;    'Alan's getting senile';    The next night, in an interview, Helmsshot back, &quot;I think Alan's getting senile. I really do.&quot;;    Two months later,a Helms fund-raising organization began sending letters singling out Cranstonas a &quot;radical&quot; who &quot;led the nuclear freeze movement to disarm America.&quot;;   Another letter, directed solely at Cranston, asked, &quot;Do you believe our lawsshould be changed to allow homosexuals and lesbian couples to exchange weddingvows and even adopt children? If you don't, I'm asking you to make anemergency contribution to the National Congressional Club because the senatorwho has sponsored that legislation is running for re-election. His name isAlan Cranston.&quot;;    Cranston put out a fund-raising letter of his ownattacking Helms. But it was his solicitation that year of nearly $1 millionfor voter registration drives from the now-indicted Charles Keating, presidentof Lincoln Savings and Loan, that was the start of Cranston's currenttroubles. Lincoln has been seized by government regulators, who have chargedthat the thrift was systematically plundered.;    Ethics committee probe;   Cranston and four other senators who accepted money from Keating and thenpressured federal regulators on his behalf were the subjects of a nationallytelevised ethics committee hearing last year.;    After secret deliberations,the committee agreed to recommend to the full Senate that Cranston bedisciplined. It criticized the conduct and judgment of the other four --Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle ofMichigan, and Republican John McCain of Arizona -- but recommended no furtherpunishment for them.;    Helms, however, had been champing at the bit for sometime. He alluded to Cranston's troubles with the ethics committee during his1990 re-election campaign, and he has been identified as one of theRepublicans on the committee who wanted tougher language used against some ofthe Democrats.;    'Unethical' conduct;  Cranston, Helms said, should becensured in a resolution that castigates him for &quot;reprehensible&quot; conduct thatis &quot;clearly and unequivocally unethical.&quot;;    But because Helms divulgedportions of a draft report by special counsel Robert Bennett that was notadopted by the committee, the turn of events could have a strange twist:Perhaps Cranston and Helms will both be censured.;    In a strongly wordedstatement, Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., the ethics committee chairman, and Sen.Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the vice chairman, termed the leak &quot;regrettable,&quot;pointed out that it violated Senate rules and called for an investigation ofwhat Helms had done.;    &quot;The committee has a necessary tradition of acting ina non-partisan framework,&quot; Sanford and Rudman said, &quot;and it has always had arule against unauthorized release or statements of confidential committeematerial. The committee has always attempted to be fair and judicious, and weare disappointed that these established practices have been violated.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CARL M.
