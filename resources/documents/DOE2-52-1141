<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-1141 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention comprises a procedure for separation of mercury from fluegases and process gases that contain water vapor together with separatingwater soluble substances from the flue gases. The flue gases are broughtinto direct contact with a finely dispersed washing liquid in two ormore separation steps and cooling down the flue gases in a downstreamstep to a temperature low enough to condensate the water content of thegases. The by this obtained washing liquid is collected and partly recirculatedwithin this step, partly injected in an earlier separation step. In thisearlier step the washing liquid is finely dispersed and meets un-purifiedflue gases, whose water soluble and potentially water soluble substancesare dissolved in the finely dispersed water. The contaminated washingliquid is collected for further treatment. The procedure is characterizedby the addition of a halogenide, like HCl, to a part of the washing liquidcollected in the earlier separation step. A sufficient amount of halogenideis added to yield a pH value low enough to flue gas sulfur dioxide todissolve in the washing liquid. In addition the halogenide content shouldalso be sufficient to form complex compounds with the flue gas mercury.This acid part of the washing liquid is supplied to the earlier separationstep in finely dispersed form. The invention also includes a device forperforming the procedure. (O.S.).</TEXT></DOC>
