Bush ordered American forces to apprehend Noriega so he could beput on trial in the United States on charges of drug trafficking,but he acknowledged that Noreiga remained at large.   ``We will chase him and we will find him,'' vowed the nation'stop military officer, Gen. Colin Powell. He said reinforcementsflown to Panama and those on the way would bring the U.S. forcethere to 24,000.   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said nineAmericans were killed in action, 39 were wounded and one wasmissing. He said he did not know how many Panamanians had died.   The Pentagon codenamed the mission ``Operation Just Cause.''   In a nationally televised Oval Office speech at 7:20 a.m. EST, asomber Bush said, ``I took this action only after reaching theconclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives ofAmerican citizens were in grave danger,'' Bush said.   The White House said the decision had been reached Sunday, afteran American Marine officer was shot and killed outside Noriega'smilitary headquarters.   Bush offered this explanation:   ``General Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americansin Panama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 Americancitizens in Panama. As president, I have no higher obligation thanto safeguard the lives of American citizens. And that is why Idirected our armed forces to protect the lives of American citizensin Panama, and to bring General Noriega to justice in the UnitedStates.''   But while key military objectives had been achieved and mostorganized resistance eliminated, Bush said, ``the operation is notover yet. Gen. Noriega is in hiding.''   ``Nevertheless, yesterday a dictator ruled Panama and todayconstitutionally elected leaders govern,'' the president said.   One intelligence source on Capitol Hill said there had beenreports in recent months of a deterioration in Noriega's mentalstate, including increased paranoia and constant drinking. But thesource cautioned that the reports were not based on hard evidenceand he discounted their importance as a factor in the launching oftoday's military action.   U.S. officials noted that leaders of a failed coup attempt lastOctober had said Noriega had been drinking heavily and Powell saidhe had heard reports that Noriega had been threatening operationsof the canal.   After his speech, Bush signed an order lifting U.S. economicsanctions against Panama and directing ``an orderly unblocking ofPanamanian government assets in the United States.''   Separately, Bush issued a memo to the Pentagon specificallyauthorizing U.S. forces to apprehend Noriega ``and any otherpersons in Panama currently under indictment in the United Statesfor drug-related offenses'' and to turn them over to U.S. lawenforcement officials.   However, his declaration that Noriega had so far eludd the graspof American forces left the overall success of the military missionin question.   Bush said Guillermo Endara, who won last May's election inresults that Noriega refused to accept, was hastily sworn in aspresident of Panama. And he said he was committed to implement thePanama Canal Treaties and surrender control of the canal to Panamain the year 2000.   Bush's swift action stood in contrast to his inaction lastOctober, when he kept U.S. forces on the sidelines while somePanamanian generals sought to oust Noriega in a coup. Bush drewheavy congressional criticism at that time.   As evidence, Bush noted that Noriega last week declared his``military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the UnitedStates.'' He also recited a series of events in Panama over thepast few days, including the fatal shooting of an American militaryofficer.   ``Tragically some Americans have lost their lives in defense oftheir fellow citizens, in defense of democracy,'' the presidentsaid. He expressed his condolences to their families and said heregretted that some innocent Panamanians also had been killed.   Bush said the forces flown overnight to Panama would bewithdrawn ``as quickly as possible.'' Powell said nearly 7,000additional soliders and paratroopers had arrived from statesidebases and 2,500 were en route this morning to supplement thosetroops based in Panama.   Bush said he informed congressional leaders and U.S. alliesabout his decision.   Sen. Jesse Helm, R-N.C., predicted, ``The majority of the Senatewill feel good by this turn of events.'' Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, said Bush's action ``was made necessaryby the reckless actions of Gen. Noriega.''   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said, ``I would not have engaged in suchunilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without the support ofother Central American nations.   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States,called at the request of Noriega's envoy, Endara issued a statementasking the organization to recognize Lawrence Chewning Fabrega asits ambassador to the OAS. The statement was faxed to the OAS fromthe U.S. Army South headquarters in Panama, according to thesign-off.   Noriega's representative, Jose Maria Cabrera, stayed in thechair designated for his country. ``I am the representative of theRepublic of Panama, and I denounce this criminal aggression,'' hetold a reporter.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administrationsent a cable to Soviet officials informing them of the action. TheSoviets swiftly condemned the move as a violation of the UnitedNations charter.   Bush said the United States had tried repeatedly _ butunsuccessfully _ to use diplomacy and negotiation to remove Noriegaand that it was now recognizing the ``democratically electedgovernment.''   The president spoke after only a few hours of sleep. He hadstayed in the Oval Office until a few minutes after 4 a.m. tomonitor developments in Panama, and was in time for his speech thatbegan shortly after 7 a.m.   Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIand other top aides also were at the White House for much of thenight.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Powell were in the Pentagon'smilitary command center.   Beginning with Bush, the administration did what it could topreserve secrecy of the operation before Fitzwater's dramaticannouncement about the military action. The president hosted aWhite House Christmas party attended by reporters, but gave no hintof the impending action.   U.S. military intervention in Central America is a tradition oflong standing _ including President Reagan's decision to invadeGrenada in 1983 and overthrow a leftist government.   Bush had hinted at military action earlier in the week, when hetold interviewers, ``I think a president, all presidents, haveoptions, but they don't discuss what they might be.''   First Reagan and then Bush have been trying to force Noriega'souster since 1988, when the Panamanian leader was indicted in thiscountry on federal drug trafficking charges. The United Statesimposed stiff economic sanctions against Panama in hopes ofdislodging him from power.   The situation in Panama had been jumpy for days. Tuesdayafternoon, the Pentagon spokesman said a U.S. soldier used anunauthorized weapon when he shot a Panamanian police officerMonday. He called the incident ``very regrettable'' but said it hadto be considered in the context of a deteriorating situation.</TEXT></DOC>
