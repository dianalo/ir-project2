But Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir's announcements are shorton details, and some experts fear they may prove to be windowdressing to adorn another authoritarian military regime in Khartoum.   Shortly after Bashir overthrew Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi'scivilian government Friday, the little-known paratroop brigadierimposed a state of emergency. He disbanded the country's 36political parties, banned independent newspapers and slammed anindefinite nighttime curfew on the capital.   Coup leaders declared themselves a 15-member Command Council ofthe National Salvation Revolution chaired by Bashir. He quicklyskipped a rank to become a three-star general and appointed himselfprime minister, defense minister and military commander in chief.   Bashir then went about consolidating power in the classic way. Heretired 28 of his military superiors and promised speedy trials forpoliticians and officials he accused of stealing public funds anddestroying the economy. Soldiers arrested 20 or so seniorpoliticians, but Mahdi himself remains at large.   ``Any coup has to start out like this,'' said Peter Woodward, aSudan expert lecturing at Britain's Reading University.   ``It could be the basis of authoritarianism. When informationbecomes clear on exactly how many people they have arrested, the waythey are treating them, whether they will reopen educationalinstitutions, that will show the degree of authoritarianism,'' hesaid Monday in a telephone interview.   The ``June Revolution'' is the fourth military coup in Sudan's 33years of independence from Britain. Generals have ruled all but 10years.   ``It looks like this leader has all the characteristics of themilitary regimes in the '50s and '60s,'' said Tim Niblock, directorof Middle Eastern politics at Britain's Exeter University.   ``It's not just that he has taken all these measures,'' Niblocksaid. ``He seems to be saying that political parties are a waste oftime and bound to be corrupt. It's difficult to see him looseningthese controls anytime soon.''   Woodward agreed. He said the civilian government Bashir haspromised to appoint on an unspecified date could turn into a groupof civil servant puppets with the junta pulling the strings.   Yet Sudan's military once before has kept such a promise. Thejunta that overthrow military dictator Gaafar Nimeiri in April 1985pledged to restore civilian government in a year. They surprisedobservers by overseeing fair multiparty elections that brought Mahdito power in April 1986.   Woodward said he is not surprised Bashir suspended moves to endthe civil war, canceling a new round of talks with the rebel SudanPeople's Liberation Army that was to begin Tuesday in the Ethiopiancapital, Addis Ababa. Mahdi initiated the new initiative underpressure from the military and trade unions.   Woodward said the new leadership is bound to take stock of thegovernment's position in the bloody, costly six-year conflict beforereturning to the bargaining table, which Bashir has promised to do.   The war, against the minority animists and Christians of thesouth, cost the government a ruinous $1 million a day and causedwidespread famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.Bashir is from the dominant northern Arabs, who are Moslem.   Exeter's Niblock said the new leadership is ``making the rightnoises'' about ending the war and emphasizing Mahdi's failure todeal with the fighting and the economy as reasons for the coup.   But he stressed Bashir's coup faces the same problems as othermilitary takeovers in Africa and the Middle East.   ``The new leadership makes a hit with the media,'' Niblock said.``Then the regime loses impetus, problems build up and the militaryis not equipped to deal with them. It has no political experience.''   Sudan's 22 million people complained Mahdi's indecisivenesscrippled his ability to end the war or improve the economy. Mahdi'sgovernment was buffeted by street demonstrations protesting highprices and severe shortages of basic goods.   When Bashir broadcast news of the coup Friday morning overofficial Radio Omdurman, there were no obvious signs of oppositionor happiness.   ``It's difficult to try and second-guess them,'' Woodward said ofthe junta's plans. ``Maybe they haven't thought it out themselves.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Cairo-based correspondent Dalia Baligh frequentlyhas traveled to Sudan to report on developments there for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
