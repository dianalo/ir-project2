Campbell officials are looking at ways of protecting thatinvestment and are estimating it will cost $60 million.;   City Manager ThomasFrutchey said &quot;significant financial decisions&quot; on how to maintain and repairthe street system will have to be made in the coming months. One possibleanswer is creation of a citywide street maintenance assessment district.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CAMPBELL SEES STREETS AS GOLDEN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     A recent report by the public works department cited several reasons forthe worsening condition of streets.;   First, the streets are heavilytraveled. A study by the Institute of Traffic Studies found the city's trafficvolume is more typical of a community of 50,000 to 60,000. Campbell'spopulation is just over 36,000.;   Also, traffic loads on many streets exceedthe design strength of the pavement, many substandard streets have beenannexed to the city in recent years, and some streets have simply reached theend of their service lives.;   Topping it off, the city has had inadequatefunds for street maintenance.;   Bill Helms, deputy public works director,said the annual maintenance need is $4 million but the city has been able tospend only $2.5 million a year. Regular street maintenance coupled withcorrecting current deficiencies would put annual street maintenance costs over$8 million.;   Under-funding street maintenance hastens the time whenexpensive street reconstruction is needed.;   &quot;One of the aspects of streetdeterioration is that, in the beginning stages, it's all under the surface,&quot;Frutchey said. &quot;At the end, the street surface cracks and chips, which meansit's been let go too long. Repair and maintenance is much cheaper thanrebuilding.&quot;;   It's estimated the city's total investment in streets is $200million. &quot;We can't afford to let that asset deteriorate and decrease invalue,&quot; Frutchey said.;   The Benefit Assessment Act of 1982 provides forcreation of an ongoing maintenance district similar to the city's currentlandscaping and lighting district. Helms said a strong advantage of this typeof district is that assessments to individual property owners can be closelyrelated to the benefit derived by each parcel.;   &quot;It's been suggested that(vehicle) trip ends would be an appropriate way of setting the assessment fora parcel,&quot; Helms said.;   He said the staff is trying to improve theeffectiveness of street maintenance. These efforts include seeking the mostuseful equipment and methods.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL CRONK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910925  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  409  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 25, 199100269343,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
