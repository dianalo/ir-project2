Although officials do not yet know exactly what caused Sunday'scrash of the ultra-modern Air France jet, a preliminary probeindicated the plane was flying too low when it made a pass duringan air show, French officials said Monday.   But the president of Air France's pilots union said the plane'sengines may have failed to restart at the pilot's command.   As investigators attempt to sort out the cause of the crash, thedestruction of the highly computerized aircraft has raisedquestions about the A320's safety and the potential impact onAirbus Industrie, the European consortium that builds the plane.   ``It's obviously not good,'' said Anthony Hatch, an airlineanalyst for Argus Research Corp.   The accident could inflict psychological damage against thehighly-touted A320 and prompt cancelled orders and lost sales,Hatch said. Because only a handful of the narrow-body jets have arein service yet, he said, the A320's defenders can not point to along flight safety record.   The incident also focuses attention on the trend toward moretechnology and fewer pilots _ the newer planes rely on two pilotsin the cockpit instead of the usual three.   Airbus, which is financed by the governments of France, Britain,West Germany and Spain, competes intensely with U.S. aircraftmakers Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.   The crash of the A320 ``does help Boeing somewhat; it's hard tosay how much,'' said Bill Gorman, an aerospace analyst forProvident National Bank in Philadelphia.   The A320 competes most closely with newer versions of Boeing's737 and with McDonnell Douglas' MD-80 _ which also are relativelysmall planes ideal for shorter hauls. But the U.S. rival planes areless technologically advanced than the Airbus jet.   Air Canada, which is on the verge of buying 33 A320s, saidMonday it will keep close tabs on the French government's inquiryinto the crash. Airbus is believed to be close to winning the AirCanada contract over Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.   The A320, which carries about 150 passengers, uses 40 percentless fuel than similar aircraft and is the fastest-selling plane inaviation history.   Only four of the new planes are currently in service _ two areoperated by Air France _ in addition to the one destroyed in thecrash _ and two by British Airways PLC. But more than 500 have beenordered by 21 customers worldwide, including the French and Britishcarriers.   Among U.S. carriers, Northwest Airlines has ordered 100 of theplanes, in a deal valued at $3.2 billion.   ``I doubt (the crash) would have an impact on our decision topurchase from Airbus,'' Alan Muncaster, a spokesman for Northwest,said Sunday. ``But obviously we would want to check into the causeof the crash.''   Pan Am Corp., another major U.S. airline, has ordered 16 A320sfor $488 million, with an option to buy 34 more. It would bepremature to re-evaluate that decision until the full results ofthe crash inquiry are in, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon saidMonday.   Two U.S. leasing companies also have ordered the A320: GATX Air,a subsidiary of GATX Corp., has ordered 10 while InternationalLease Finance Corp. has three on order. Spokesmen for the two leasecompanies were unavailable for comment Monday.   British Airways suspended use of its two A320s after Sunday'scrash, but put them back into service starting Tuesday as theresult of discussions with Airbus and Britain's Civil AviationAuthority. Air France's two remaining A320s, which also weregrounded, were put back in operation as of Tuesday.   The plane's highly computerized system replaces the pilot'scontrol stick with a series of computers and miles of electroniccables. Instead of the pilot physically moving the stick to adjustthe aircraft's flaps, for example, computers are used to send anelectronic signal to the flaps.   ``We have full faith in this airplane,'' said David Venz, anAirbus spokesman in Herndon, Va. ``It will continue to be one ofthe most successful in aviation history.''   If the cause of the crash turned out to be a computer softwareproblem, it would be a sort of ``black eye'' for Airbus but wouldbe easily ironed out, suggested Edward Starkman, an airline analystfor investment firm PaineWebber Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
