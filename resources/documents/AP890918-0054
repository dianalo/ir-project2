French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, commenting to reporterslast week, said one of the major problems facing the investigatorsis the absolute bank secrecy of some countries, which makesfollowing the trail of drug money extremely difficult.   ``The maintenance of absolute bank secrecy seems to me to beincompatible with the efficient fight against the laundering of drugmoney,'' he said.   Among those attending the one-day meeting were Switzerland andLuxembourg, two countries whose stringent bank secrecy lawsfrequently have frustrated law officers.   The French are playing host to the meeting in the greatestsecrecy, refusing even to acknowledge where in Paris it is beingheld and announcing in advance that there would be no newsconference nor any information about it afterward.   Monday's gathering was to be the first of several. Its primarygoal will be to create a ``Financial Action Task Force'' to increaseinternational cooperation in tracking down the profits from thenarcotics trade.   The impetus for this latest effort at cooperation came fromPresident Francois Mitterrand, who had it included in the finalcommunique of the annual summit meeting of the world's seven richestdemocracies in Paris July 14-16.   ``This is not a study group,'' Beregovoy stressed. ``This groupof experts must devise and take action decisions.''   Surveys in the United States indicate that Americans considerdrugs and drug abuse the most important problem facing the country.The issue is also of growing concern in Western Europe.   The purpose of today's meeting, in the words of the TreasuryDepartment official, was to inventory and evaluate the current stateof international efforts against money laundering; to determine whatimprovements can be made in this area; and to submit a report to theheads of state and finance ministers of the countries involved withthe experts' analysis and recommendations.   The report is due in April.   ``The global financial system is one of the integral parts of theinternational drug `conspiracy,' if you like,'' said the U.S.official. ``The recognition of the need to rein in the financial andeconomic side of the house means there needs to be a marriage of thetraditional law enforcement on one side and the financial andeconomic on the other.''   Participating in the meeting are the seven nations of the annualeconomic summit, the United States, France, West Germany, Canada,Britain, Japan and Italy _ plus Australia, Austria, Belgium, Spain,Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, along with theEuropean Commission, executive body of the Common Market.</TEXT></DOC>
