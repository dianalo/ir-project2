This work reveals that ejection of Ar atomsfrom electronically excited solid argon films arises from two nonradiativerepulsive dissociation steps in the deexcitation decay sequence whichcontains the major radiative transition. A hole-diffusion model withnonradiative quenching at the metal substate on which the films are grownaccounts for the dependence of the sputtering and luminescence on filmthickness and gives an estimate of 230 A for the hole-diffusion length.The hole-diffusion model also explains the nearly linear dependence ofthe sputtering and luminescence yields on electronic stopping cross sectionfor high-velocity incident ions. Intentionally added O{sub 2} and N{sub2} impurities reduce the hole-diffusion length. These reductions providevalues for effective reaction volumes, k/sub +/tau/sub +/, of 7 x 10/sup-21/ cm{sup 3} for O{sub 2} and 3 x 10/sup -21/ cm{sup 3} for N{sub 2},where k/sub +/ is the interaction rate constant of the holes with theimpurity and tau/sub +/ is the lifetime of holes in pure films. The O{sub2} and N{sub 2} impurities also quench nonmobile luminescent excimers,Ar{sub 2}/sup */, over large distances: 21 A for O{sub 2} and 11 A forN{sub 2}. The magnitude of the sputtering yield characterizes the vacuuminterface as primarily hole reflecting, but with a surface-hole-trappingrate about 6 times that of the bulk. Surface O{sub 2} impurity greatlyenhances surface trapping of free holes. Sputtering of Ar{sub 2}/sup*/ dimers is evident from the observation of 11.3-eV luminescence inthe region in front of the argon films. The dimers are emitted with {similar_to}0.8eV of kinetic energy.</TEXT></DOC>
