The Frankfurt market was closed.    Tokyo had heavy trading as steel and heavy industrial stocks returned to center stage.    The Nikkei index added 195.14 points to close at a record 28342.46. The broader market posted only modest gains, however, as pharmaceutical, real estate and most financial issues were mixed to lower. Electricals were lower almost across the board.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 2.15 points, or 0.10%, to close at 2219.33. The Nikkei's gain, by contrast, came to 0.69%. First section volume was estimated at 1.7 billion shares, up from 1.4 billion shares Thursday.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, share prices were broadly weaker. The Nikkei index fell 109.91 points to end the session at 28,232.55.    Traders said the steels were firmer during the morning session, and then surged during the afternoon, helped by a wave of buying from a major Japanese brokerage firm.    Nippon Steel closed at its high for the day of 571 yen ($4.55), up 12 yen. Volume came to 131.3 million shares, making Nippon Steel the most heavily traded issue in the sector.    Kawasaki Steel rose 19 to 582, while NKK rose 15 to close at 545, and Sumitomo Metal Industry gained 15 to 520.    Among electricals, Sony fell 50 to 5,170, while Matsushita Electric Industrial was off 50 at 2,530, and NEC fell 40 to 2,130.    London share prices settled lower as the market became unhinged by worries about interest rate increases.    The Financial Times 30-share index was off 9.0 at 1472.6. Volume was a moderately healthy 506.1 million shares, compared with Thursday's 467.5 million issues. The 100-share index finished down 11.8 points at 1850.1.    Analysts said the market became unglued over a perception that the U.K. government would raise interest rates to douse an overheating economy. &quot;We know the authorities would love to tickle up interest rates a fraction if they only have the opportunity,&quot; said one trading floor manager at a large U.K. brokerage house.    Randall Goldsmith, an equity strategist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London, said profit-taking coincided with fears of rising inflation, which caused concern that &quot;profit-taking might accelerate into a rout&quot; of the recent rally.    The rise in share prices over the course of the week was another source of concern, analysts said, as they questioned the speed of the ascent. &quot;We ran up too far and too fast this week, and it just wasn't sustainable,&quot; one dealer said.    Among the rare gainers on the day, Cadbury Schweppes rose 4 pence to 405 ($7.25) on volume of 4.6 million shares. One dealer said he saw &quot;quite a few good nibbles&quot; for Cadbury shares Friday.    Rowntree edged 1 penny higher to #10.51 on volume of 360,000 shares. Observers said there was a belief that next week would bring some resolution to the pending bids for Rowntree, a U.K. confectioner.    Elsewhere, shares rose in Zurich and Milan, but ended mixed to lower in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. Thursday's decline on Wall Street and worries about higher interest rates weighed on most markets.    Among Pacific markets, stocks closed at a record high in Taipei, were higher in Seoul, Manila and Hong Kong, mixed in Sydney and lo wer in Wellington and Singapore.    The Sydney market defied the sharp fall in New York and negative domestic trade figures. Brokers said the market demonstrated a &quot;surprising degree of resilience.&quot;    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
