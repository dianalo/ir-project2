LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Underground leaders in the occupied lands urgedPalestinians on Wednesday to ``burn the earth with fire and anger''in continued rebellion.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the uprising has the samegoals as Palestinian ``terror organizations,'' and declared that``terror must be met by force.''   Doctors at Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank said a 19-year-oldArab died of gunshot wounds suffered in a clash with Israelisoldiers last month in a village near Bethlehem.   An army spokesman said reports of the death were beinginvestigated. It would bring to at least 186 the number ofPalestinians killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip since Palestinian riots began Dec. 8.   Instructions for more Arab strikes, boycotts and otherresistance appeared in a new underground leaflet. It wasdistributed as soldiers rounded up at least 11 journalists andother community leaders in overnight raids.   ``Let's burn the earth with fire and anger under the feet of theoccupation,'' the leaflet said. ``Painful blows should be inflictedagainst the occupation soldiers and policemen and thecollaborators.''   The bulletin was the 16th from the United Leadership of theUprising in five months of rebellion among the 1.5 millionPalestinians in the occupied territories, which Israel capturedfrom Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.   It said the leadership ``calls for a complete boycott of theZionists and asks the people to ready themselves for civildisobedience by storing food in houses, enough for at least amonth.''   Police spokesman Alex Lapidoth in Jerusalem said more than 2,000extra officers were ordered deployed in the Holy City from Thursdaythrough early next week.   He said they were needed to handle anticipated Arab proteststhis weekend at the end of the Moslem feast of Ramadan and onSunday, Jerusalem Day, when Israelis celebrate the 21st anniversaryof city's reunification.   The leaflet ordered demonstrations on Friday the Moslem sabbath,a ``day of anger'' and general strike Sunday and a march byteachers to protest the closing of Palestinian schools.   Rabin told a meeting of B'nai B'rith leaders from around theworld the uprising has ``the same political goals ... that thePalestinian terror organizations try to achieve by terror andatrocities.''   ``Terror must be met by force,'' he said. ``Any giving in toviolence will invite more violence, terror and the increasingdanger of war.''   He defended the use of force to put down the revolt, sayingsoldiers and police acted within the limits of Israeli law.   ``I know that you have seen television day and night, all thestories of confrontation between civilians and the military,'' hesaid. ``I will not deny it. This is what we have to do.''   In the West Bank village of Qabatiyeh, 47 Palestinians werecharged with manslaughter in the lynching death of an Arab manaccused of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Israel radioreported.   Mohammed Id Sakanda was dragged from his home and hanged from anelectricity pole in February.   Israeli soldiers closed the main vegetable market in Hebron andused loudspeakers to order merchants there and in other towns tokeep their shops closed in the morning, when leaders of theuprising have told them to open.   A struggle between the army and Palestinian leadership over whenstores will close and open has continued for months.</TEXT></DOC>
