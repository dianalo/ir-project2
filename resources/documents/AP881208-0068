(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Atlantis returned from itsfour-day secret space mission more bruised than normal, but thedamage is not severe enough to delay its next scheduled launch, NASAsays.   Up to 175 thermal tiles were heavily damaged, apparently duringliftoff, possibly by something loose hitting the orbiter, saidConrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director.   ``The damage comparatively is significant, but it's not a majorconcern,'' he said Wednesday. ``We have to understand why we hadthis damage and keep it from happening again.''   Nagel said the damage would be easy to fix and that it would notaffect Atlantis' next flight, scheduled for launch April 28 with aspacecraft that is to be dispatched to the planet Venus. Overall, hesaid, Atlantis returned from its classified military mission onTuesday in ``very clean'' shape.   There were only a few minor technical problems during the flight,he said. One entailed a minor malfunction in the shuttle's airconditioning system, causing about a gallon of water to leak intothe cabin. The astronauts used a vacuum cleaner to clean it up,Nagel said.   During the flight, the five astronauts inspected and assessed thebattered tiles, using a television camera on the end of the ship's50-foot robot arm, Nagel said.   The shuttle is covered with about 28,000 tiles made of variousmaterials designed to protect it from atmospheric re-entry heat. Hesaid the tile damage posed no threat to the shuttle's return toEarth.   Nagel said the heaviest damage was concentrated in a strip3-to-4-feet long ``down the right hand side, along the line of thefuselage.''   One tile in the nose was missing and ``it looked like it waspopped off by the impact of something,'' he said.   There was speculation here that a part from the solid fuelbooster rockets, the external tank or the orbiter might have fallenoff and hit the craft. Nagel said he did not want to speculate.   A small fiberglass panel was missing from one of Atlantis'maneuvering engines, but this probably did not cause the problem,officials said.   Nagel made his comments in an interview from Edwards Air ForceBase, Calif., where he leads a team that is inspecting Atlantis andpreparing it for return to the Kennedy Space Center here Tuesdayatop a Boeing 747 airliner.   He said Atlantis' tile damage was about twice that suffered byDiscovery, which made the first post-Challenger shuttle flight twomonths ago.   ``It appears that between 125 and 175 tiles will have to bescrapped and replaced,'' Nagel said. In addition, he said, scores oftiles with scratches and ``dings'' will have to be repaired in place.   ``Dinged'' tiles are common on a shuttle, with much of the damagebeing caused by objects kicked up from the runway when the vehiclelands.   He reported brakes and about 200 other systems modified since theChallenger explosion 34 months ago worked well.</TEXT></DOC>
