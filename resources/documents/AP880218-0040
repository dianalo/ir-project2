(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, the winner of the NewHampshire Democratic primary, set the stage for a debate with hisrivals tonight by talking tough on military policy and promising ahard line on terrorism.   Dukakis traveled south Wednesday, touting positions aimed atsatisfying more conservative voters. And he tossed a few pointedbarbs at Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who has staked his entirecampaign on doing well in the South.   The governor was to spend part of today back at theMassachusetts Statehouse in Boston, and travel to Dallas for afaceoff with the other Democrats.   Facing the inevitable question about whether he is too liberal,Dukakis said at a news conference, ``I don't understand theselabels. I'm a guy who's supposed to be a liberal from theNortheast. I've balanced nine budgets in a row ... I've cut taxesfive times in the last four years. We've cut crime.''   In Atlanta, Dukakis said he wanted to strengthen the nation'sconventional forces and crack down on terrorism. He challenged hisDemocratic rivals to out-do him on ``toughness.''   ``I don't yield on toughness to Al Gore in any shape ormanner,'' Dukakis said.   Later in Florida, Dukakis fired another shot across Gore's bowwhen told that Gore had accused his opponents of being alienatedfrom the electorate.   ``Mr. Gore left Iowa, virtually left New Hampshire,'' Dukakissaid. ``I don't know who's alienated.''   The governor's message was not entirely hard-line. In theClearwater press conference he stated flatly, ``I'm not going tocut social programs ... I, for one, am not going to balance thebudget on the backs of poor people.''   He also said he would keep the defense budget at about itscurrent funding. To cut the federal deficit he said, as he hasthroughout the campaign, that he would institute an aggressive taxcollection program.   Florida is of critical importance to the Dukakis campaign.Dukakis said it may offer his best opportunity to win one of thesouthern states on Super Tuesday.   Speaking to about 600 cheering supporters in this Gulf coastcommunity, Dukakis said, ``If, three weeks from now, with yourhelp, we can do well in Florida, we're going to be on our way tothe White House.''   The idea that the South is politically different from the restof the nation is false, Dukakis said.   ``There's a mythology about the South as if it's some kind offoreign country. It's nonsense,'' he said.   Campaign aides say Dukakis will focus his economic opportunitymessage on states with the most electoral votes. And he will drivehome his points with the biggest campaign war chest of any of theDemocratic candidates.   Former Kentucky Gov. Martha Lane Collins and former New OrleansMayor Dutch Morial endorsed Dukakis in his Atlanta appearance.   Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, Florida and Marylandare states where Dukakis is expected to do well on March 8. Others,like Alabama, Texas, Kentucky, South Carolina and Georgia, won'tcome to the Dukakis fold as easily as New Hampshire, his aidesacknowledge.   Boston-based political consultant Michael Goldman said Dukakiscampaign sources tell him the governor will spend between $3million and $4 million in the South.</TEXT></DOC>
