Gen. Prosper Avril says.   Avril, in power since being installed in a coup a year ago, saidthat without international assistance his government has beenunable to provide the people of this impoverished Caribbean nationwith jobs and and security.   ``Nevertheless, we have demonstrated our will to govern thiscountry democratically,'' Avril said in an interview Monday at theNational Palace. ``But if the U.S. does not assist us financially,we still may have problems.''   Washington suspended two-thirds of its direct aid to Haiti aftera Nov. 29 1987 election-day massacre and the subsequent suspensionof balloting by the military. The U.S. government has said thattransfering power to a civilian government is a key condition forrestoring the aid.   Avril's government said Sunday that local, legislative andpresidential elections will be held next year. In the interview,Avril said the army would not interfere with the balloting andwould ensure security.   The government has not said, however, whether or not it willallow international observers monitor Haiti's next election.   Presidential elections are to be held in two rounds _ Oct. 17and Nov. 11, 1990. The first round will be among about 10candidates and the second will be a runoff among an unspecifiednumber of the top vote-getters.   ``We have announced the electoral timetable. We now expect toreceive the assistance which will make the elections a success,''Avril said.   When asked whether he would be a candidate Avril said, ``Theonly thing I do with my power is try to put my country on the roadto democracy, the only way to develop this country.''   Under Haiti's constitution, no member of the military can becomepresident less than a year after resigning. Therefore, Avril wouldhave to resign before Oct. 17 in order to run.   Next year's balloting will be Haiti's first presidentialelection since Jan. 17, 1988, when civilian Leslie Manigat waselected in balloting widely regarded as fraudulent. He was oustedin an army coup five months later.   A previous military government stopped balloting during the 1987election when street gangs assisted by soldiers shot and hacked todeath 34 people at the polls.   The canceled vote was the first attempt at free elections afterdecades of Duvalier family dictatorships. President-for-lifeJean-Claude Duvalier, who succeeded his father Francois ``PapaDoc'' Duvalier on his father's death, fled during anti-governmentdemonstrations in February 1986 and now lives in France.   Avril, 51, took power on Sept. 17, 1988, after a coup againstthe regime of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy that was organized bynon-commissioned officers. The coup leaders said they wanteddemocratic reforms and an end to what they called state-sponsoredviolence.   Shortly after taking office, Avril began a 19-point program togive Haiti a constitutional government, purge undesirable elementsfrom the army and improve soldiers' living conditions.   On Dec. 14, his government signed five international humanrights conventions. But rights groups have said violations, oftenperpetrated by soldiers, are still common in Haiti, where 80percent of the 5 million residents live in poverty.   In March, Avril partially restored the 1987 constitution thatNamphy had suspended and in April installed a nine-memberindependent electoral council to organize next year's elections.</TEXT></DOC>
