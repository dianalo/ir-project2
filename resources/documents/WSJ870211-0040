Alluding to Mr. Baker's Texas background, he said, &quot;We are told that he wears boots under his suit pants on Saturdays. The only other cowboy leather on him is invisible, worn on his character. He is deceptively tough.&quot;    Mr. Clark went on -- and on. At various points he referred to Mr. Baker as &quot;The Miracle Man&quot; and &quot;The Velvet Hammer.&quot; He also compared him favorably to Michaelangelo.    Some in the audience thought Mr. Clark might have overdone it. &quot;He could have called that talk, 'Jim Baker, Superman,'&quot; said one executive. Even Treasury officials, who have heard many a gushing introduction, were impressed: &quot;As a PR guy, I'm supposed to say the secretary is all of those things and more, but that was getting awful flowery,&quot; remarked one.    The reviews left Mr. Clark puzzled. &quot;I'm not going to stand up there and just say, 'Here he is, the honorable secretary,'&quot; he says. &quot;We try to make it interesting . . .. Was it too long?&quot;    Rising Executive   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca brought along an unusual prop when he spoke at the recent National Automobile Dealers Association's annual convention in Las Vegas, Nev. -- his own motorized, air-cooled, custom-built podium.    Baron K. Bates, vice president of Chrysler public relations, says the auto maker has three of the podiums, specially built about three years ago for a price the company won't disclose. Chrysler decided to order the special stands when speaking requests, mainly for Mr. Iacocca, skyrocketed with the chairman's increasing popularity. &quot;We found when we went out and did these things that we got everything from quite satisfactory to disastrous podiums,&quot; says Mr. Bates. &quot;You might wind up with a music stand.&quot;    The most important feature is a motor that raises and lowers the podium at the &quot;push of a button,&quot; Mr. Bates says. Other features are a built-in microphone, a reading light and a fan that circulates air around the speaker -- through adjustable louvers that came from a Chrysler dashboard. Rumors that the podiums are air conditioned are &quot;a myth,&quot; Mr. Bates insists.    Mr. Bates also is adamant that the podiums aren't Mr. Iacocca's. They're &quot;part of our fixed assets; any executive can use them,&quot; he says.    Beware, Louisville!   Not that they have anything against art, but some folks in Bakersfield, Calif., were a little nervous when Armand Hammer's collection of Impressionist and Renaissance paintings arrived for a local exhibit.    Bakersfield is headquarters for the international oil operations of Occidental Petroleum Corp., of which Dr. Hammer is chairman and chief executive officer. For some time, there have been rumors of pending layoffs.    Was the art exhibit perhaps an attempt to soften up Bakersfield for bad news?    Not at all, said Dr. Hammer. He cautioned that a company reorganization was in progress. &quot;But all the rumors about our pulling out of Bakersfield are false,&quot; he told a local TV station.    Six days later, Occidental announced that it would cut 200 of its 600 jobs in Bakersfield. A company spokesman says the timing of the exhibit and the layoffs &quot;was really a coincidence and nothing more.&quot;    Several years ago Tulsa, Okla., also enjoyed a visit by Dr. Hammer's art collection. At the time, hundreds of Cities Service Co's. employees were being let go after Occidental acquired the company.    The Hammer collection moves to Louisville, Ky., next month.    ODDS andamp; ENDS: The new paint shop at General Motors Corp.'s recently renovated plant in Linden, N.J., is off limits to visitors. All visitors. Last month, on a tour for directors, Chairman Roger B. Smith asked to see where the cars are spray-painted. He got a polite &quot;no&quot; from J.R. &quot;Russ&quot; McCarthy, the 40-year GM veteran who runs the plant. The reason: &quot;dirt control&quot; in the painting area. &quot;I wouldn't take my own mother up there,&quot; said Mr. McCarthy. . . . &quot;How do you know when your bank is about to be closed?&quot; a Texas banker asked an official of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &quot;Look for 50 rental cars with Oklahoma plates,&quot; quipped Michael J. Zamorski, an FDIC assistant regional director. Oklahoma was No. 2 in bank failures last year, after Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
