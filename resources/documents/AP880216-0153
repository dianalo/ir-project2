Abu Nidal's dissident PLO group, known for terrorist attacks,also vowed revenge.   Two of the bodies, of Mohammed Sultan and Mohammed Buheis, wereflown to Amman, Jordan, for burial.   The Palestine Liberation Organization has blamed Israeli secretservice, Mossad, for the killings Sunday and the explosion Mondayon the ferry Sol Phryne, both in Limassol. The ferry was holedbelow the waterline.   Cyprus condemned both attacks but made no accusations, and saidan investigation was being conducted to determine whether theevents were related.   A PLO statement issued in Nicosia said: ``Israel knows that thePLO is not handcuffed. ... The blood of our martyrs will not gounavenged.''   Sultan, Buheis and the third guerrilla, Marwan Kayyali, werekilled in a car bombing in Limassol, on the southern coast.   They apparently were attacked after arranging the sale of theSol Phryne to a PLO-affiliated company for the ``ship of return''voyage to Israel with 130 Palestinians who have been expelled fromIsraeli-occupied Arab territories. The trip originally was to havebegun at Piraeus, Greece.   In Athens, PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the three menwere not linked to the voyage.   ``We deny completely any relationship between the three who wereassassinated by the Israelis two days ago in Limassol and thejourney of return,'' he told reporters. ``We deny any relationshipbetween the three martyrs and chartering the boat. ... We deny also... that the ship was bought by the three men.''   He said they were ``on a different mission.''   ``We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite ofIsraeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, nobleideas,'' Abu Sharif said.   Cleanthis Vlahopoulos, captain of the ferry, said ``severalmonths'' would be needed to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again.   In Lebanon, a statement by the Abu Nidal group pledged to avengethe guerrillas' deaths with ``double, swift retaliation.''   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has been blamedfor terrorist attacks around the world since splitting from YasserArafat's mainstream Fatah guerrillas in the early 1970s. He iswanted in Europe and the United States.   A senior PLO official in Nicosia said the slain guerrillas werenot members of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council, but ``theywere popular, active and well-respected officers with whom AbuNidal had worked before he split from Fatah.''   Also in Lebanon, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad Squads inPalestine said it would kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ofIsrael Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon ``as a price for thiscrime.'' The threat was contained in a statement delivered to aWestern news agency in Beirut.   A man claiming to speak for the U.S.-based Jewish Defense Leaguesaid Monday it was responsible for the attack on the 6,151-ton SolPhryne.   ``The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol,'' he toldThe Associated Press in Nicosia by telephone. ``This is only awarning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it.''   The head of the Jewish Defense League, Irv Rubin, told TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview Monday from Los Angelesthat the bombing was a ``righteous action'' but his organizationwas not involved.   Shamir has said the voyage would be considered ``a declarationof war'' and Israel would stop it ``in the ways it sees suitable.''   Israel's transport minister, Chaim Corfu, appeared to suggest onTuesday that his government was behind the bombing.   If the PLO obtains another vessel, ``its fate will be thesame,'' he said on Israel radio. ``We knew we wouldn't allow theboat to reach Israel. If we could prevent its departure, that wasobviously the right thing to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
