CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the month before TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggartwas silenced by scandal, his preaching turned from outward attacksto self-criticism in what ``may have been the outgrowth of his ownsin,'' a researcher says.   ``He lately started putting himself down,'' says Stephen M.Winzenburg, a communications professor at Florida Southern College.``It makes you wonder how much of it was guilt seeping through.   ``He usually had put others down and pumped himself up as beinggreater than anyone else, with an inside, direct line to God. Butthen all of a sudden, he started saying these negative, deprecatingthings about himself. He seemed to be pointing a finger at himself,and preaching it to others.''   Leaders of the Assemblies of God in Swaggart's Louisianadistrict initially recommended that he be suspended from preachingfor at least three months because of his reported involvement witha prostitute. National leaders of the church have asked thedistrict to review that recommendation, and perhaps make thepenalty more severe.   Winzenburg, a Catholic whose monitoring project mainly aimed attiming and comparing fund-raising pitches of TV evangelists, saidhe was puzzled when Swaggart began switching his preaching targets.   ``It was something that hadn't been there before, but now itmakes more sense,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It may havebeen the outgrowth of his own sin.   ``He also started picking on fellow Pentecostals. Before, he hadfocused more on attacking Catholics and mainline Protestants. Butnow he was denouncing his own kind.''   From Swaggart's preaching since mid-1987, some of it taped andbroadcast after his Feb. 21 confession to his congregation of``grievous sin,'' Winzenburg cites these samples of Swaggart'sself-deprecation:   July l2 _ ``I'm scared to death of money and scared to death ofwomen. Those two things have caused more creatures' downfall thanany other.''   Dec. 14 _ ``I'm a poor, pitiful, flawed creature.''   Dec. 20 _ Taking an odd subject for a Christmas sermon, heidentified himself with Judas, who betrayed Christ.   Feb. 21 _ Comparing himself to the biblical harlot, Rahab, hesaid he was a ``poor, pitiful, scarred, flawed piece of humanity.''   Samples given of his put-down of other Pentecostals:   Feb. 24 _ Attacking higher education, he said, ``EvenPentecostal schools are straying.''   Feb. 25 _ ``Holy Ghost preachers are falling for seducingspirits at an alarming rate. This is the paramount danger of thechurch.... In supposedly Holy Ghost (Pentecostal) churches, thepastors never preach on the Holy Spirit.''   July 24 _ He said that after criticizing the Catholic Church,``all hell broke loose,'' but he had ``a right to criticize othersbecause the book (Bible) gives us the right.   ``If Catholics go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. IfBaptists go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. Even ifPentecostals go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. That's whatwe'll continue to do.''   Swaggart lodged complaints of sexual misconduct that led to theouster of former TV evangelist Jim Bakker and that also bumped aNew Orleans evangelist, Marvin Gorman. Both were ministers of theAssemblies of God. Gorman reportedly provided evidence thatunseated Swaggart _ pictures of him at a motel with a prostitute.   Swaggart also has harshly assailed other denominations,declaring Dec. 13 that ``in most churches in America, you couldn'tget saved if you wanted to.''   Some of his sharpest assaults on Roman Catholicism seem to havebeen toned down lately, Winzenburg said. Some TV stations hadthreatened to drop his program if the attacks continued.   The Louisiana Interchurch Conference, including most majorProtestant and Catholic bodies in the state of Swaggart'sheadquarters, in 1983 formally protested his attacks on Catholicism.   The Rev. James L. Stovall, the conference executive director,says ``we took it pretty lightly'' when Swaggart denouncedBaptists, Methodists and other Protestants, but when he beganstirring up anti-Catholic venom, ``We had to condemn it.''   Swaggart has called Catholicism a ``false cult,'' a``monstrosity of heresy'' and a ``complete contradiction of theword of God.''   Roman Catholic Bishop Stanley J. Ott of Baton Rouge, La., metwith Swaggart in 1984 to urge him to stop the attacks, but saidafterward Swaggart continued to ``harbor judgments and makestatements'' about the church that were neither true nor fair.   The Rev. Robert Furlow, a Catholic permanent deacon andcommunications officer for the Baton Rouge diocese, observedsomewhat prophetically before Swaggart's downfall:   ``When you start attacking others, it can turn in on oneself.When you're firing rockets around, you're liable to hit yourself inthe foot.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv04</NOTE></DOC>
