Box 646, Dublin, OH 43017, proposing that andSection; 178.2650 <T3>Organotin stabilizers in vinyl chloride plastics </T3>(21 CFR 178.2650)be amended to provide for the safe use of a mixture of dodecyltin tri(isooctylmercaptoacetate)and di(dodecyl)tin di(isooctylmercaptoacetate) as a stabilizer in polyvinylcloride and vinyl chloride copolymers intended for use in contact withfood.FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. Theagency concludes that the proposed use of the additive is safe, and thatthe regulations should be amended in 21 CFR 178.2650 by revising the introductoryparagraph, by adding new paragraph (a)(7), and by adding new paragraph(b)(1)(iii). The agency is also modifying the nomenclature for the twoorganotin chemicals in this additive. The agency is listing them as ``dodecyltinS,andmin172;,S&quot;-tris(isooctylmercaptoacetate)'' and ``di(<T3>n</T3>-dodecyl)tin S,Sandmin172;-di(isooctylmercaptoacetate).'' The agencyconcludes that this nomenclature is more descriptive than that set outin the filing notice and is also more consistent with the nomenclatureused for other chemicals appearing in 21 CFR 178.2650.Additionally, the agency is making editorial changes in the introductorytext and in the introductory text of paragraph (a) of andSection; 178.2650.It is changing the term ``octyltin,'' used to describe tin compounds inthese paragraphs, to read ``organotin.'' This term more accurately describesthe tin compounds in the referenced paragraphs. It is also changing thereference to ``polyvinyl chloride and vinyl chloride copolymers'' to read``vinyl chloride homopolymers and copolymers'' to reflect the terminologyused in the agency's proposal on these substances. See 51 FR 4177, February3, 1986.In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact, includinga determination that this action will have no effect on the market forvinyl chloride, and the evidence supporting that finding, contained inan environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch(address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Thisaction was considered under FDA's final rule implementing the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (21 CFR Part 25).Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before March 16, 1989 file with the Dockets Management Branch(address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separatelynumbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularitythe provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the groundsfor the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requestedshall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particularobjection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall includea detailed description and analysis of the specific factual informationintended to be presented in support of the objection in the event thata hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis forany particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearingon the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted andshall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the headingof this document. Any objections received in response to the regulationmay be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 178</ITAG>Food additives, Food packaging, Incorporation by reference.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to theDirector, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Part 178 is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 178_INDIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES: ADJUVANTS, PRODUCTION AIDS, ANDSANITIZERS</ITAG>1.
