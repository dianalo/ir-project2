The Mexican debt crisis triggered an avalanche of more than $450 billion in unpayable foreign debt that soon enveloped most of Latin America, many other developing countries and their international creditors.    Despite substantial progress, particularly in strengthening international banks' capital and reserves, debtors and creditors are still groping for ways out of the international debt debacle. For example, Brazil, the developing world's biggest debtor, hasn't paid interest on its estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt for half a year; it hasn't even begun serious negotiations with its creditors on the unpaid interest.    Peru and Ecuador are months in arrears on their interest payments. World economic growth is slowing, making it harder for debtor countries to export. And a rise in interest rates could make much developing country debt unserviceable.    U.S. and British banks recently have added more than $23 billion to their loan-loss reserves. Commercial bank lenders probably will have to set aside even more, particularly if the industrialized world's economic growth continues to slow.    For their part, developing countries are trying to make their economies more efficient. Some are opening up to foreign investment, and have begun to entice foreign capital back. But progress is slow.    For Western nations and Japan, the developing world's stagnation and debt burden is a drag on economic growth. The developed countries, particularly the U.S., have watched some of their most valuable markets shrivel. The U.S. has traditionally exported heavily to Latin America, where foreign debts are biggest.    &quot;The industrial countries have a real need to open up the less-developed countries,&quot; says Lowell Bryan, a senior consultant on financial institutions at McKinsey andamp; Co. &quot;They need them as markets.&quot;    To be sure, since Aug. 20, 1982, when then Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul A. Volcker began patching together a rescue for Mexico, the world has avoided the financial catastrophe that many commentators had predicted. Since October 1985, when Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a plan to counter the debt crisis, there has been a loose blueprint for dealing with the problem that is broadly acceptable to most debtors and creditors. The so-called Baker Plan calls for economic changes in 15 major debtor countries in return for loans from the World Bank and commercial banks.    Three major debtors, Mexico, Nigeria and Argentina, have agreed to new borrowings linked to economic restructurings in line with the Baker Plan. And Chile, Morocco, the Philippines and Uruguay have agreed to debt reschedulings and made economic changes that conform to the treasury secretary's initiative.    But it has been easier for banks to build their capital and reserves, and thereby help to insulate the world financial system against crisis, than for developing countries to cut back bureaucracy and corruption and thus boost exports to earn hard currency to service their debts.    International banks, often with encouragement from their national regulators, have built their capital rapidly. The primary capital of nine U.S. money-center banks rose more than 60% to a total of $46.7 billion at the end of 1986, up from $29 billion four years earlier. In Britain, definitions of primary capital were relaxed to allow banks there to issue so-called perpetual floating-rate notes that they could count as primary capital.    Of course, banks remain vulnerable to impasses with major debtors, such as Brazil's current suspension of interest payments. Indeed, U.S. banks may have to begin writing down the value of their Brazilian debt this fall if they aren't close to reaching agreement with that country.    Still, whatever the banks' problems, heavily indebted countries in the developing world face much greater challenges. They need to improve their economies, most of which more closely resemble those of Eastern Europe than the fast-growing developing countries of the Far East.    Some countries, such as Mexico, Chile and the Philippines, have begun restructuring to try to replace the bureaucratic inefficiencies that contributed to their difficulties. Mexico has removed many import duties and set about selling some state companies. Chile has reduced its foreign debt by about 10% in the past 20 months by swapping debt for equity investments.    U.S. banks are getting help from regulators in reducing their huge loans to heavily indebted countries. The Federal Reserve Board, in a move designed to aid debt-equity swaps, this week said U.S. banks could acquire as much as 100% of nonfinancial companies in 33 indebted countries. Before, they could hold only 20%.    Though the ruling permits banks to hold these stakes for only five years, it should facilitate swapping debts for equity investments. In the past two or three years international banks have swapped a total of about $6 billion of debt for equity investments in developing countries.    Major U.S. banks reacted cautiously to the Fed's action.    U.S. banks reacted cautiously. &quot;It's only a partial answer to a maiden's prayer,&quot; a senior banker at a New York money-center bank said of the loosened restrictions. &quot;There aren't a basketful of attractive companies that are being privatized in these countries,&quot; he added.    A spokeswoman for Bankers Trust New York Corp. said, &quot;We believe any liberalization . . . is a very welcome development, and that this is an initial step. But we feel further liberalization is necessary.&quot;    Jay H. Newman, senior vice president in charge of loan transactions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said, &quot;The problem is that if it's a good company, the country will only sell it for cash, and banks aren't going to buy companies for cash, they want to swap debt for them.&quot;    But debtor nations' efforts to sell off state entities, which dominate their economies, and to strengthen free enterprise have come slowly. Most debtors have lagged in trying to overhaul their economies. &quot;From the fall of 1982, when the developing-country debt crisis broke, until the end of 1984, very little was done in these {heavily indebted} countries which involved any kind of structural change,&quot; says Ernest Stern, senior vice president for finance at the World Bank, although he is more sanguine about the record of the past two years.    These countries also have found it increasingly difficult to borrow additional money from bank and government creditors, and they haven't generally attracted other forms of investment. It's only in Mexico and Chile that substantial amounts of flight capital have come back into the country.    In 1983 alone, local investors who lacked confidence in their own countries sent an estimated total of $19 billion abroad from ten of the biggest debtor nations. That slowed to $5.4 billion in 1985, but 1986 was probably the first year in a decade when there weren't substantial net flows of local money out of debtor countries.    Apart from a few large debtors such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, whose collapse could threaten the financial system, few heavily indebted countries have succeeded in getting sizable new bank loans.    In 1986, bank loans to the 15 major debtor countries named in the Baker Plan fell $2.8 billion to a total of $301.2 billion at year-end, after increasing by $800 million in 1985. Those numbers should improve in 1987 because banks have pledged to lend more than $9 billion to Mexico, Argentina and Nigeria this year.    But there is a long line of debtor countries looking for more loans. It is doubtful banks will accommodate all their needs, following the banks' huge additions to loss reserves for past loans. Colombia, the Philippines, Venezuela and Brazil probably will seek a total of many billions of dollars from their banks in the next 12 months. Already, Brazil is talking of a bank loan of more than $7 billion.    The banks, under pressure to expand their lending, are quarreling among themselves about who should make new loans. Many regional banks are balking at making new loans to creditor nations. And bankers criticize their own governments for not doing enough for the big debtors.    Governments and international agencies are a dwindling source of finance for the so-called Baker 15 countries. They lent these debtors an average total of $13.8 billion a year in 1983 and 1984 but managed only $6.6 billion in 1986.    &quot;It would be of considerable help if governments would show the same flexibility to the less-developed countries that they ask from commercial banks,&quot; says William R. Rhodes, a Citicorp group chief executive in charge of debt rescheduling. He argues that industrialized countries should stretch out repayment of debts they are owed and should allow their export-development agencies to resume lending more quickly once developing countries have instituted economic changes.    But government creditors and international agency lenders don't see it that way. The commercial banks &quot;want us to bail them out,&quot; says the World Bank's Mr. Stern. Treasury Secretary Baker last month told Brazil's finance minister, Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, that increased lending was &quot;a problem for the banks, and that the taxpayer has nothing to do with&quot; it, according to the Brazilian minister.    ---                 Repayment Gets More Difficult       (Total foreign debt as a percentage of exports)                           1982     1984     1986     1987 Argentina                  405      461      536      554 Brazil                     339      322      425      471 Chile                      333      402      402      370 Colombia                   191      254      198      235 Equador                    239      259      333      464 Mexico                     299      292      413      366 Nigeria                     84      158      300      310 Peru                       269      356      497      551 Philippines                269      309      308      309 Venezuela                   84      158      322      278    Source: Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.   ---                   The 'Baker 15' Countries         (Total foreign debt, in billions of dollars)                            DEC. 31, 1982    DEC. 31, 1986 Argentina                      $45.4            $51.6 Bolivia                          3.7              4.5 Brazil                          85.3            110.3 Chile                           18.0             21.5 Colombia                        10.6             14.7 Ecuador                          7.5              9.1 Ivory Coast                      8.0              9.4 Mexico                          87.6            100.3 Morocco                         11.3             15.9 Nigeria                         14.3             23.4 Peru                            12.2             16.2 Philippines                     29.5             28.3 Uruguay                          4.2              5.2 Venezuela                       37.2             34.1 Yugoslavia                      20.0             19.4    Source: Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</TEXT></DOC>
