As a vicepresident of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle EastAirlines, he has seen 12 planes lost to shelling and morehijackings than he can recall. Staff members have beenkidnapped and shot. Fighting closed MEA's hub, Beirutairport, for months at a time. And when it opened, it oftenwas the destination of choice for international terrorists.   The airline's pilots joke that Beirut has become sosynonymous with hijackings that gunmen can't think of anyother destination to ask for. In Cyprus, a man once jumped onan MEA flight and demanded to be flown to Beirut. The planewas going there anyway.   Yet the airline has survived during Lebanon's 16 years ofwar, and now, with a cease-fire almost a year old, is doingrecord business. One reason for the airline's resilience: Itoffers services its competitors wouldn't dream of, even innightmares.   At times, the airline's courtesy bus has made thefive-mile run to the airport from downtown hotels with aphalanx of security guards riding shotgun. For months, whenmortar attacks were a daily threat, no MEA craft sat on thetarmac without a full tank and crew, ready for instanttakeoff if the attacks got too heavy.   MEA probably is the only airline with a war-traumaspecialist as its medical officer. Marcel Prince, a retiredarmy colonel, worked in a Vietnam burns unit and wrote afield surgery manual-involving skills that have been indemand at MEA.   During a 1985 hijacking, a disgruntled airport securityguard ordered the pilot to take off while the doors stillwere open. Some passengers jumped out before liftoff,breaking legs and suffering other injuries. One was killed,sucked out after the plane became airborne. Other times, Dr.Prince has had to patch up staff members caught in crossfireon their way to work. &quot;It's one thing to get the bullet withyour name on it,&quot; says the physician. &quot;It's another thing toget the one marked `To Whom It May Concern.'&quot;   Gallows humor has sometimes helped the airline's staffdeal with the daily danger. Norma Karaoglan, public-relationsmanager, remembers a cheeky colleague's response when akidnapper held up the airline's bus in which the two womenwere traveling. She refused to budge, declaring: &quot;I can't gowith you today. I have a lunch date.&quot; The kidnapper let hergo.   But mostly, employees have kept the airline aloft out ofloyalty to their company and their country. Its fleet of 15crafts -- mostly venerable 707s -- all bear the cedar ofLebanon on their tails -- the emblem that appears on theLebanese flag.   Even in the worst times, few of the airline's 5,000employees resigned, and fewer were fired. For 40 days in 1985when the trip to the airport was too hazardous, the airline'schief executive, Salim Salaam, turned the airline officesinto a dormitory and slept there with the rest of the staff.At other times, he has taken the whole airline out of town,operating out of Paris in 1975 and Cyprus in 1983 and 1989.   During one five-month airport closure, employeesvolunteered to work for half-pay rather than have anyone losejobs. They still accept lower-than-average wages. But theairline's insurance bill is huge, and most of its planes areexpensive fuel-guzzlers.   &quot;From a strictly economic point of view, it's amazing thatthey've kept going,&quot; says a spokesman for the InternationalAir Transport Authority in Geneva.   When times in Lebanon are bad, the airline leases aircraftand crew to British Airways and Air France. And it scrapes upcash wherever it can. In 1976, facing a precipitous drop infirst-class passengers, it went into the caviar business,selling excess stocks at half-price.   Beirut airport's location in the heart of the city'sembattled southern suburbs has added to the airline'sburdens. The airport road passes between the often-besiegedPalestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila and runsthrough Shiite neighborhoods adorned with huge billboards ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   It is turf that has changed hands a dozen times in thelast decade, turning executives such as Mr. Mujais intodiplomats as much as airline officials. He lists thedifferent groups that have controlled the airport: &quot;First wehad the Palestinians, then the Lebanese army, then {theShiite} Amal {militia}. In 1982 it was the Israelis, in 1983the American Marines, then Amal again, and now the Syrianarmy.&quot;   Apart from its domestic travails, the airline has becomeentangled in international imbroglios. It may be the onlyairline hijacked by Israelis. An MEA Caravelle was making theshort hop from Cyprus to Beirut when two Israeli Phantom jetsforced the plane to land in Tel Aviv. The Israelis mistakenlythought a wanted Palestinian was aboard. The plane and itsshaken passengers were soon released.   When Amal wanted to settle a score with Jordan's KingHussein, gunmen hijacked a Jordanian plane to Beirut andburned it. An outraged Lebanese then tried to hijack an MEAplane in protest. A passenger on that plane had beentransferred from the ill-fated Jordanian flight, gaining thedistinction of being hijacked twice in the same day.   The airline also bears reprisals for the acts ofnon-Lebanese based in Lebanon. Back in 1968, when Palestinianguerrillas attacked an El Al jet in Athens, Israelis avengedthe incident by landing commandos at Beirut airport anddestroying 13 aircraft, including a third of MEA's fleet.   Also costly for the airline was the June 1985 hijacking ofa Rome-bound TWA jet by Hezbollah members seeking the releaseof 17 prisoners held in Kuwait. The plane landed twice inBeirut, where hijackers dumped the body of the U.S. navydiver Robert Stethem on the tarmac. The airline tried tosupport the hostages during negotiations for their release,and flew freed passengers to Cyprus at its own expense. But amonth later, Ronald Reagan embargoed U.S. travel to Lebanon,costing the airline its lucrative nonstop New York-Beirutservice. &quot;He wanted to punish Beirut, punish the airport&quot; forlax security, says Khattar Hadati, the airline's senior vicepresident for government affairs, &quot;and we had to pay for it.&quot;   But one American -- MEA's U.S.-born flight attendant,Nicolette Allam -- ignored the embargo. &quot;It's fun to beAmerican on the plane,&quot; she says, because nobody expectsAmericans to be in Lebanon anymore. After nine years at MEA,Ms. Allam has particularly enjoyed her work since lastsummer, when most militias agreed to withdraw from Beirut andreunite the long-divided city. &quot;So many people are comingback after years away,&quot; she says. &quot;When they get their firstglimpse of the city, the seat belts come off and they'reclapping and jumping all over the place.&quot;   MEA is applauding, too. Increased passenger demand hasrequired it to get back two aircraft leased to Air France andto lease additional planes. Last month was the busiest since1975. MEA even welcomes the return of competitor airlinesbecause it means returning confidence in Lebanon. Staffmembers are beginning, cautiously, to imagine a day when thesandbags in front of their offices might be replaced byflower beds.   &quot;We had to learn the art of survival,&quot; says Mr. Mujais.&quot;We've always thought that as long as Lebanon can make it, wecan too.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
