The candidate slips in polls as GOP attacks get wide press coverage. As Dukakis parades vice presidential prospects, some see parallels to Mondale's ill-received process. Dukakis's teasing of Glenn last week played poorly; strategists warn that the selection should be announced early next week to head off further criticism. Relations remain unsettled with Jackson, who faces left-wing pressure to hang tough.    But top Democrats say it's better to confront problems now than later in the campaign, and the Atlanta convention provides the vehicle to rebound strongly. Despite the desire to placate Jackson, a moderate tone is expected to dominate. Keynote speaker Ann Richards is advised to stress defense more than day care.    Recalling 1984 attacks on &quot;San Francisco Democrats,&quot; a party operative predicts, &quot;Republicans won't be able to talk about 'Atlanta Democrats.'&quot;    OFFICIALS SPLIT on overtures to Iran following the downing of the Flight 655.    The State Department pushes for a conciliatory line through third parties. But CIA, Pentagon and other officials suspect the agency is too eager to rush into a dialogue without determining who speaks for Iran. That, they say, would push U.S. hostages to the top of the agenda -- with the Iranians using them to barter for a U.S. withdrawal from the gulf and other concessions.    For now, U.S. analysts are encouraged by statements from the Lebanese terrorists holding the American hostages. They interpret the statements as indicating that the terrorists are paying more attention to Speaker Rafsanjani than to other Iranian leaders urging immediate retribution for the shooting down of the plane.    MAJOR MEASURES fall by the wayside as Congress heads toward adjournment.    Only a handful of bills, mostly driven by election-year politics, are assured of passage: the revamped trade bill, the plant-closing measure, an omnibus anti-drug bill, the minimum-wage increase and the U.S.-Canada trade treaty. Likely casualties include welfare reform -- which might never emerge from a House-Senate conference -- and Sen. Proxmire's anti-takeover bill.    Among issues that will be pushed into next year: early-childhood education, tax incentives for college-tuition savings, changes in the law governing legal immigration. Labor's hopes of banning &quot;double-breasting,&quot; or dual-shop arrangements in the construction industry, also go a-glimmering.    But lawmakers brag that, for a change, they will avoid the necessity of passing a huge catch-all spending bill this year.    DEBATE DODGER? As Bush's poll standings improve, his aides duck discussions about the campaign debates that the two parties have promised to hold. His handlers know he can't avoid debates entirely. But unless he is well behind in the polls, they want to minimize the number of them -- and thus the risk of a Bush gaffe.    GAG RULE? Soviet military chief Akhromeyev's U.S. visit ignites a caustic feud between Joint Chiefs Chairman Crowe and State Department officials, who wanted to forbid him from discussing foreign policy with his Soviet counterpart. National Security Adviser Powell had to referee, agreeing that Crowe should be free to discuss any issue but not to negotiate on arms control.    NEVER MIND? After months of dire warnings about mandatory Gramm-Rudman spending cuts, OMB chief Miller softens his line. He tells reporters he is &quot;a little teeny bit more optimistic&quot; than he was a month ago. A likely scenario: A projection that the fiscal 1989 deficit will be just shy of the $146-billion trigger for across-the-board cuts.    ALL IN THE FAMILY: Bush, who this week promised to put a Hispanic in his cabinet, recently surprised attendees at a private Northern California fund-raiser by bragging that he has even mobilized his &quot;Mexican grandchildren&quot; to help campaign. Son Jeb is married to a Mexican-born woman who is a naturalized U.S. citizen.    BURGEONING SPENDING on health-care programs alarms budget planners.    Even without figuring the cost of likely new programs, some analysts predict Medicare will exceed the defense budget by the year 2000. Some hope the deficit-reduction commission, due to report after the election, will come up with politically palatable suggestions for holding down costs. But pressure continues to run toward expanding, not cutting, health programs.    Even a modest long-term-care bill, likely to be a hot issue in the next Congress, &quot;would cost in the tens of billions,&quot; analysts at the Urban Institute say. And the prescription-drug provisions of the new &quot;catastrophic&quot; program cause concern: Congressional and White House cost estimates have varied widely, and experts say no one really knows how expensive it will be.    Among those nervous: the drug industry, which fears an outcry about costs could lead to tough price curbs.    MINOR MEMOS: Attending &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; the musical about poverty and revolution, Reagan tells a cast member backstage: &quot;It's so different from 'Bedtime for Bonzo.'&quot; . . . After a lifetime of covert operations, veteran clandestine CIA official Dewey Clarridge comes in from the cold -- to become a top marketing executive at General Dynamics. . . . Invitations to an Atlanta reception honoring Sen. Bentsen include a card reading: &quot;Please note: This is not a fund-raising event.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
