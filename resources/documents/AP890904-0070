About 2,500 students at the multi-racial University of Nataldefied a police ban on the meeting to protest Wednesday'sparliamentary elections, from which blacks are excluded. Policearrested 18 protesters, the witnesses said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The witnesses said 10 people were injured when the crowd fled thegunfire and tear gas.   In a similar rally at the nearby University of Durban-Westville,eight people were arrested when police swinging batons dispersed 500students at a banned demonstration.   It was unclear if anyone was struck by bullets. Police had noimmediate comment on either of the protests.   Earlier today, police spokesman Brig. Leon Mellet said policewere ``prepared to come down mercilessly and hard on anyone whowishes to disrupt the elections.''   Meanwhile, thousands of black workers and students were poisedfor a two-day general strike beginning Tuesday to protest theexclusion of the black majority from the polls.   On Sunday, thousands of blacks marched on a beach reserved forwhites. Police arrested 58 people during the protest, the latest ina series of acts of defiance protesting the white-led government'srefusal to allow the black majority a vote in national affairs.   ``We want to tell (Acting President) F.W. de Klerk that we aregoing to defy until we are free,'' black Anglican Archbishop DesmondTutu told about 1,000 people at a church service Sunday inBonteheuvel, a mixed-race township outside Cape Town.   Police have arrested more than 1,500 demonstrators and detainedwithout charge an additional 240 activists since the defiancecampaign began Aug. 2, according to the Human Rights Commission, anindependent civil rights group.   Major anti-apartheid groups and the country's two largest blacklabor federations have endorsed protests on Tuesday and Wednesday aspart of the nationwide defiance campaign.   The organizations have not called specifically for a generalstrike, which is illegal under the 3-year-old state of emergency.But in the past, such protests have resulted in mass strikes.   The multi-racial University of Cape Town, the site of frequentanti-apartheid demonstrations, announced today that it would beclosed Tuesday and Wednesday.   ``For the university to adopt an attitude of business as usual inthe context of the tensions surrounding the elections and the denialof fundamental freedoms ... would be neither principled norpossible,'' Vice Chancellor Stuart Saunders said in a statement.   The crowd of beach protesters stretched for more than a milealong the shore. Several dozen whites, some carrying whips andwearing ``whites only'' T-shirts, yelled abuse as the throng paradedalong the segregated sections of South Africa's most heavilyfrequented beachfront.   Other sections of the hotel-lined Indian Ocean shore have beenopened to all races in recent years.   One angry white man barged into the crowd, yelling and pushing,but police said they could control the situation on their own. Somewhites yelled to the officers, ``Shoot them dead!''   The police contingent of several hundred officers was equippedwith shotguns and a water cannon but made no efforts to stop theprotesters from moving onto the segregated beach.   Previous targets of the defiance campaign have includedsegregated hospitals, schools and buses.   Many activists have defied restrictions imposed on them followingtheir release from detention, and several banned organizations havedeclared that they were resuming operations.   Protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at awhites-only beach near Cape Town on Aug. 19. At least two Cabinetministers of the governing National Party have expressed regret forthat incident, but the government has given no public indicationthat it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control thegovernment and economy and maintain separate districts, schools andhealth services.</TEXT></DOC>
