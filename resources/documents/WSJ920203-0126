But after weeksof studying the problem, it hasn't radically changed itsformula for doing the job.   There are more and more hints of trouble inside Saddam'sIraq. American intelligence recently has reported a few&quot;serious flare-ups&quot; of fighting in which organized bands ofShiite Muslim rebels have attacked Iraqi army units insouthern Iraq. In one sign of concern, Saddam Hussein in thepast few weeks has formed a new presidential protectionforce, apparently recruited from the elite Republican Guard,a Pentagon official asserts.</LP><TEXT>   Such signs of trouble have stoked the administration'syearning to get the Iraqi dictator who, against all odds,survived his drubbing in last year's Persian Gulf War. Theyprompted a recent policy review, in which the administrationmade contingency plans to provide U.S. air cover to support acoup, officials say.   &quot;There is a generalized sentiment that this administrationisn't interested in another Panama One,&quot; says one U.S.official, referring to the first ill-fated effort byPanamanian military officers to oust Manuel Noriega, whichcaught the administration flat-footed and unprepared to help.   Yet despite some overheated press speculation in the pastfew weeks, the administration hasn't altered its centralanalysis of the best way to topple Saddam Hussein. Officialsstill calculate that a successful coup can start only fromwithin the core Sunni Muslim ruling clique in Baghdad. Thatmeans the U.S. is counting on an insurrection from inside thearmy, the Republican Guard, the ruling Baath Party or -- anintriguing new possibility -- Saddam Hussein's own extendedfamily, where there seems to be increasing turmoil.   Senior administration officials deny recent news reportsthat the U.S. has changed its view and decided to arm Shiiteand Kurdish rebels in southern and northern Iraq. There stillis little appetite inside the administration for setting offa sectarian war that, U.S. officials fear, might rip apartIraq without booting Saddam from his perch in Baghdad.   There is some sentiment in Congress for a covert Americanprogram to arm ethnic Iraqi rebels, particularly the Kurds.But in general, the administration's cautious attitude isshared on Capitol Hill, officials there say.   Democrats who opposed the war in the first place areparticularly unenthusiastic about endorsing a risky covertaction program, the aim of which would be to help PresidentBush dispose of the biggest blemish the war left on him. Noneof the eight Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee,which would have to be consulted on a covert program to armanti-regime Iraqis, voted for last year's resolutionapproving use of force against Iraq.   The administration believes that Kurdish and Shiite rebelssimply mightn't have the clout or organization to toppleSaddam Hussein, and that any initial success they might havewould simply allow the dictator to rally his Sunni Muslimminority around him.   The administration has become more willing, though, towork with Shiites, as well as Kurds, as part of an effort tocreate a broad opposition coalition to oppose Saddam Husseinand offer itself as an alternative to his rule. And SaudiArabia, deeply concerned it could be the target of revenge bySaddam Hussein, has lost some of its fear that helping Shiiterebels could help create a new, radical, Iran-like Shiitestate on the Persian Gulf.   As a result, the Saudis are more willing to funnel help toShiite rebels, U.S. officials say. Clearly, Shiite fightersare getting weapons from somewhere, though U.S. officialsthink most of the arms were captured from the Iraqi army inthe chaos following the war or are supplied covertly by Iran.   Similarly, despite its cautious attitude, theadministration has stepped up its signals encouraging arebellion from within Iraq's Sunni ruling clique. There aresigns the U.S. and its allies are pumping more propagandainto Iraq encouraging such action. And though the recentpolicy review revealed deep Pentagon skepticism about gettingU.S. forces involved in some murky enterprise with uncertainchances, officials say it at least generated generalguidelines for helping would-be coup plotters.   Still, while the level of interest is higher, theunderlying policy analysis doesn't appear much different nowthan a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
