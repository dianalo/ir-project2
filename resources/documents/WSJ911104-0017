Since spring, it has tried. Industrial production turnedup in March; employment started growing slowly in April.Geoffrey Moore, a member of the committee of economists thatdates such events, said early last week that &quot;it's fairlyclear, although not absolutely 100% clear, that the recessionended in May.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But by the end of the week, new statistics indicatedanother stall. Orders for factory goods fell, home salesplummeted, and a report out last Friday showed thatemployment, too, declined slightly in October.   Meanwhile businessmen and consumers appear convinced theeconomy is even worse than the economists and theirstatistics say it is. A sour mood has set in across the land,and as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, that attitudeitself has emerged as a major roadblock to economic revival.   &quot;It's fascinating,&quot; says Robert Hall, the StanfordUniversity economist who heads the recession-datingcommittee. &quot;In terms of economic fundamentals, it's hard tothink of any that are particularly bad. But there is thisgloom hanging over the economy.&quot;   The split between sentiment and statistics was evidentearly last month, when 14 chief executives gathered at theCarlyle Hotel in Manhattan to hear from the economic expertsat the Conference Board, a business research group.   &quot;The economists started talking about a recovery,&quot; recallsLennox Brown, chief executive of Teleflex Inc., a diversifiedmanufacturing company in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. &quot;But we allsaid: `Hey, you're not being realistic. The economy hasstalled.'&quot; Mr. Brown says his firm, which makes controls thatgo into everything from automobiles to lawn mowers, isbetting that consumers &quot;aren't going to do anything until thespring of 1993. We'll just bounce along the bottom.&quot;   Marne Obenauer, who heads a large graphic arts companycalled Devon Group Inc., in New York, is equally glum. &quot;Forthe foreseeable future, nobody sees anything good happening,&quot;he says.   Public opinion has also taken a markedly negative turn. Anew Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 32% ofvoters think the economy will get worse in the next year,while only 26% think it will get better. That's a reversalfrom the previous month, when 32% thought it would getbetter, and only 24% thought it would get worse.   Moreover, when asked whether they planned to spend moremoney on Christmas shopping this year than last year, only 6%said yes. Nearly half -- 47% -- said they would spend lessthis year than last.   Such pessimism has the potential to cause the economy toturn south again -- perhaps leading to the &quot;double dip&quot;recession that some commentators have long feared. At best,the combination of sour attitudes and stalling statisticssuggests the recovery will continue to be a halting one. GaryCiminero, chief economist for Fleet/Norstar Financial Group,calls it a &quot;convalescence&quot; rather than a recovery.   In Washington, the signs of continuing economic troublesare prompting a lot of finger pointing, but as yet, no clearaction. &quot;The economy is in trouble and families are hurting,but the administration still does nothing,&quot; Democratic Sen.Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts said on Friday. TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady says Democratic fear-mongering isresponsible for the crisis in confidence. &quot;The Democraticopposition is making a feast out of the fears of the Americanpeople,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;I don't think that's aresponsible thing to do.&quot;   And President Bush pointed his finger squarely at theFederal Reserve. &quot;I think we could go down more on {interest}rates&quot; to help the economy, he told reporters in Houston.   To be sure, by most measures the current recession doesn'tlook nearly as bad as the nation's last downturn, whichbottomed out in November of 1982. The unemployment rate nowis 6.8%; in 1982, it went well over 10%. The number of jobsshed from business payrolls totals less than 1.7 million; in1982, the number approached 3 million. Even measures ofconsumer confidence, despite the big plunge they took inOctober, remain above their 1982 lows. Moreover, the stockmarket, also seen as a barometer of confidence, is settingrecord highs.   Still, what seems to be missing in consumer and businessattitudes is a clear sense that there is light at the end ofthe tunnel. In 1982, consumer confidence began climbing evenbefore the recession ended, and it climbed rapidly after therecovery began. This time around, the successful end of theGulf War led to a surge in confidence in March, but it hasbeen headed downward since.   &quot;People believe there is something wrong,&quot; says DougBailey, a veteran Republican political operative. &quot;They don'tsense that whatever troubles they've experienced in theircommunity, in their workplace, are getting any better. Theirexperience in the past is that the economy would come back,but this time it isn't coming back.&quot;   Barry Rogstad, who heads a group of midsized companiescalled the American Business Conference, sees a similarchange in sentiment. Bad economic news used to be interpreted&quot;as momentary pauses on an otherwise upward economic path.&quot;But today, &quot;the upticks are perceived as aberrations in anotherwise stagnant environment. Attitude is everything.&quot;   Moreover, pollsters are picking up disturbing signalsabout people's sense of the nation's long-term economichealth. Some 53% of the respondents to The Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll said they believe the U.S. is now &quot;in astate of decline.&quot; And other polls suggest Americans are nolonger confident that their children's generation will livebetter than their own.   The reasons for this pessimism are diverse. In part, itreflects trends that began well before the recession startedlast July. The 1980s produced an enormous speculative surgein the price of real estate and other assets, fed partly by atremendous growth in debt. But starting in late 1989, thatinflationary bubble began to burst. If the 1980s were a greatfinancial party, the last two years have seen the hangoverset in.   The effects of the bursting bubble on commercial realestate are well known; most analysts believe it will be yearsbefore commercial construction picks up again. That problem,in turn, has spilled over to the nation's financialinstitutions, which bankrolled much of the 1980s real-estateboom. And weakened financial institutions have meant lesscredit for everyone.   In addition, the drop in home values that has occurred inmany parts of the country has dealt a serious blow to thefinancial planning of Americans. For most families, the homeis their largest single asset; many planned to borrow againstit to finance their children's education, or their ownretirement. The decline in housing values may make thatimpossible.   &quot;We have some things that haven't happened to the Americanpeople before,&quot; Treasury Secretary Brady points out. &quot;Thevalue of homes has gone up for 10 or 20 years. It's embeddedin the American consciousness. When that stops, it's a verydisturbing thing.&quot; As a result, many Americans are spendingless, and trying to pay off the debts they accumulated in theroaring '80s, when consumer credit rose from 11% of thenation's output to 17%.   Patricia Hallock of Wayne, N.J., for instance, bought ahouse in 1986 for $300,000. A year later, it was appraised at$425,000, and she and her husband took out a line of creditto take advantage of their housing windfall.   But now, Ms. Hallock estimates the house is worth lessmoney than they originally put into it. &quot;It makes us verycautious,&quot; she explains. &quot;I'm less inclined to go out andspend money.&quot;   Then there are even broader trends that influence manypeople's economic worries. Since 1972, the wages and theproductivity of American workers have, overall, beenrelatively stagnant. That has resulted in the so-called&quot;middle class squeeze&quot; that has become an important part ofthe nation's political debate. The recession has heightenedawareness of that trend.   Some analysts believe the current pessimism is exacerbatedby a growing perception that government cannot, or will not,do anything about the problem. &quot;People just aren't as hopefulas they used to be about the president or Congress respondingto their problems,&quot; says Karlyn Keene, editor of the AmericanEnterprise magazine.   In fact, some analysts believe the sharp drop inconfidence in October was a direct response to events inWashington during the month, which ranged from thecontroversial hearings surrounding Clarence Thomas's SupremeCourt nomination to the squabbling over tax policy. &quot;Allwe've got is inaction and confusion,&quot; says Alan Levenson, aneconomist with the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;Theadministration isn't even capable of saying what should orshouldn't be done and why. That's very deleterious toconfidence.&quot;   In part, the squabbling in Washington reflects the federalbudget deficit, which is expected to reach $350 billion thisyear. &quot;What the economy needs is a fiscal jolt,&quot; says RobertDederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. &quot;But thecombination of the huge budget deficit, the deficit reductionact of 1990 and a split government has made fiscal policyimpotent.&quot; Moreover, while the federal government is markingtime, state governments are busily enacting tax increases andspending cuts that actually drain strength from the economy.   That leaves monetary policy with the burden of rescuingthe economy from recession. Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan showed his concern last week by nudging the keyfederal funds interest rate down another quarter percentagepoint. But in the face of a stalling economy, administrationofficials, including Mr. Brady, are arguing that larger andmore dramatic moves may be needed. Fed policy makers meettomorrow to plot the course of monetary policy for the nextfew weeks.   Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University,notes that over the last 30 years, the effects of lowerinterest rates in stimulating the economy have steadilydiminished. &quot;The overall stimulus is less than half todaywhat it was three decades ago,&quot; he says.   That's partly a result of the deregulation of the bankingsystem that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, saysMr. Gordon. Before deregulation, banks faced a cap on theinterest rates they could pay depositors. As a result, whenmarket interest rates rose too high, depositors pulled theirmoney out of financial institutions and went elsewhere toseek higher returns, constraining bank credit and slowing theeconomy. When rates came back down, money rushed back intothe banking system, expanding credit and giving a boost tothe recovery. Today, that no longer occurs.   In addition, the deregulation of rates paid to depositorshas meant the income of many people -- particularly retirees-- fluctuates with market interest rates. Thus, lowerinterest rates can actually reduce the incomes of manypeople, and reduce consumer spending -- offsetting thestimulus resulting from lower rates.   Mr. Gordon's argument is disputed by other economists. Butall agree that the way in which the Fed influences theeconomy has changed dramatically in recent years. And as aresult, it's possible that its power to stimulate the economyhas declined.   One way in which lower interest rates are supposed tostimulate the economy is by depressing the dollar. A lowerdollar, in turn, encourages the sale of U.S. exportsoverseas.   But this time, the dollar hasn't responded much to lowerinterest rates. The tumultuous events in Eastern Europe andthe Soviet Union have led investors to keep their money indollars rather than in European currencies, bidding up thedollar's value. &quot;The rolling collapse of the Russian economymay be undermining the U.S. recovery,&quot; Mr. Gordon says.   Still, Mr. Gordon agrees that the Fed could do more tostimulate the economy. With the federal funds rate -- theFed's main policy tool -- now at 5%, he notes &quot;we still havefive percentage points between here and zero.&quot;   ---   David Wessel contributed to this article.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          TELEFLEX Inc.'s chairman is Lennox Black.
