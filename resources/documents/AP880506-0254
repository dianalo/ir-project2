ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A cold spell and an early Easter curbed consumer buying lastmonth and contributed to lower-than-expected sales for the nation'slargest general retailers, according to industry analysts.   April was not expected to be a strong month because manyconsumers did their Easter shopping in March, due to theearlier-than-usual holiday. But it was colder than usual in manyparts of the country last month, and that slowed sales of springclothing and of seasonal merchandise such as gardening equipmentand patio furniture, analysts said.   The ongoing slump in consumer spending also contributed to thepoor results, which were released Thursday by the nation's biggeneral retailers.   Sales rose for some retailers, but analysts deemed the gainslackluster.   Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with the investment firm DeanWitter Reynolds Inc., described spending as ``softer than it hadbeen,'' and predicted there would be little improvement before theend of 1988.   ``It's a continuing of what we've been seeing for the lastseveral months,'' said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with BrownBrothers Harriman Inc. Ronning predicted sales would pick up in thesecond half of the year.   Economists watch retail sales closely because consumer spendingaccounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said itsoverall sales rose 4.8 percent from April 1987, and 3 percent forthe first 13 weeks of the fiscal year. Sales from stores open atleast a year _ known as same-store sales _ rose 2 percent in Apriland 1.4 percent for the year so far.   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 2.5 percent last monthand 4.4 percent for the year to date. Its same-store sales fell 0.6percent in April and rose 1.5 percent for the first 13 weeks.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales climbed 32 percentin April and 33 percent for the first three months. The rapidlyexpanding chain said its same-store sales rose 12 percent lastmonth and 13 percent for the year so far.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which heavily emphasizes its apparellines, saw sales decline 0.4 percent last month. Year-to-date saleswere up 3.7 percent.   Limited Inc., another major apparel retailer, said its overallsales fell 8 percent last month and rose 1 percent for the firstthree months of the fiscal year. Same-store sales fell 16 percentin April and 7 percent so far this year.   Fashion retailers have been slumping since last fall and are notexpected to see business turn around until this summer at theearliest.   The sales announced Thursday were from general and apparelretailers and do not reflect sales of auto dealers or supermarkets.
