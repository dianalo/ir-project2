LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain's reputation as a fashion capital forindividualists has been reinforced with autumn collections thatoffer everything from fringes, fake fur and animal prints to classicwools and perennial velvets.   The result is ``anything goes'' _ with no single direction forBritish fashion.   Skirts are long or short. Pants are narrow or very full. Jacketsare long and lean or short and swingy. The looks are ethnic, orcowboy, or biker, or Russian, or prim Miss Marple English.   ``I think anything goes this season,'' says David Sassoon ofBellville Sassoon, who designs evening dresses for Princess Diana.``But I think people have found it difficult to buy. I think they'vefound too many kooky clothes and not enough that people will wear.''   Marie Gavrielides of Warwick, R.I., whose company Kellouie'ssells to private clients, agrees, saying the British shows _ with afew exceptions _ were ``too high fashion'' for the States.   ``Paris is more classic,'' she says. ``Americans are way tooclassic for most of these collections. Everything moves so muchfaster in England. Designs are very up, very progressive.''   The greatest excitement seems to be generated at the young end ofthe fashion scene, with the accessory and clothing firm Pink Sodasetting the trend for the 15-25 generation.   Its collection _ inspired by India, Morocco and Turkey _ featureslots of embroidery, animal prints, fringed scarves, corset-likebustiers with lurex, coins, bells and pompons, and plenty of ethnicnecklaces. All are topped with fake fur or patterned velvet bowlerhats.   ``We've had a lot of interest from the States _ more than in thelast five years,'' says David Solomon, head of the firm.   Helen Storey's beaded chiffon bra tops, fringed zebra bolero andone-piece leather chaps with attached boots also are big hits in theyoung market.   Some top British designers took the bizarre route during recentLondon showings.   Katharine Hamnett's biker-look collection, harking back to the1970s, includes a skin-tight black velour jumpsuit worn withhigh-cut black leather briefs and a leather bomber jacket with metalstuds bearing her latest ecology slogan _ ``Clean up or Die.''   Rifat Ozbek, winner of the British Fashion Council's Designer ofthe Year award, returned to his Turkish roots with belly-dancer brasfringed with gold coins, leopard-print pants and Berber-stripedcoats.   At the other end of the fashion spectrum for autumn and winterare the more traditional designers who have become part of Britain'sfashion establishment.   Jean Muir features loose jumpsuits. Gina Fratini has black velvetstrapless ones molded to the body and covered with Indianmirrored-cloth jackets. Caroline Charles reflects Miss Marple _Agatha Christie's elderly sleuth who personifies British solidity _with long, lean earth-colored tweeds, trimmed in fake fur. AllyCapellino also does a prim English look with skirts down to theankle.   Edina Ronay's collection includes animal prints, velvet suitswith gold beading, and colored Venetian silks, said ``the Americansare coming back'' after several seasons in the wings.   David Sassoon, whose midi-chiffons and short sequinned wooljerseys were big sellers, also says sales to the United States areup. ``The Americans want glamorous clothes that women will wear, andthey come here for evening wear _ no doubt about it.''   But Betty Jackson, who did a softer, more feminine collectionwith a new A-line silhouette based on Tibetan and Mongolian themes,says ``the Americans have been difficult for a few seasons now.''   ``I think they come as voyeurs.''</TEXT></DOC>
