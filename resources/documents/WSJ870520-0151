TELEFONICA NACIONAL DE ESPANA, Spain's state telephone monopoly, said it is near agreement on a joint venture to make telephones in the Soviet Union.    Telefonica said it also is negotiating a joint-venture with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to make switching equipment. No further details were given.    Telefonica said it has signed a cooperation pact with the Soviet Industry Ministry, but declined to give further details. Sources said the Soviets appear willing to accept Telefonica's participation in a factory to produce low-technology telephones, and that Telefonica may import some Soviet-made parts.    Meanwhile, Telefonica's 1984 agreement with Corning Glass Works of the U.S. to produce optic fibers in Spain is unlikely to go ahead, Telefonica said. &quot;The project is frozen right now,&quot; a source said, citing declining world prices for optic fibers. </TEXT></DOC>
