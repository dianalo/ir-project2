The agreement, with Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa and theDirectorate General of Telecommunications of China's Ministryof Posts and Telecommunications, calls for the partners tobuild a new system -- including a satellite earth stationnetwork and the first undersea fiber-optic cable to China --in two phases.</LP><TEXT>   In the first phase, to be completed by next year, anetwork of satellite earth stations will be built providingdigital voice and data communications services to majoroffice buildings in Beijing and Shanghai. Satellites of theInternational Telecommunications Satellite Organization, orIntelsat, will tie the network together.   The second phase, which is scheduled to be built andoperating in 1993, is a 800-mile, digital fiber-opticsubmarine cable that will link Japan's Kyushu Island and theChinese coast near Shanghai. The cable is expected to carryabout 35,000 phone calls simultaneously, &quot;a significantexpansion over the existing system,&quot; according to an ATandamp;Tspokesman, who declined to provide further details.   William B. Carter, ATandamp;T's executive director of submarinesystems, said the China system will provide one of the lastmajor links in a digital communications system encircling theglobe. He said equipment suppliers for the systems haven'tbeen chosen, but said the project should cost between $20million and $45 million.</TEXT></DOC>
