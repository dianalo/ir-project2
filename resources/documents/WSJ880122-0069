Those people close to the grand jury investigation here said the case involved less than $1 million in alleged false claims by a Rockwell division. They said that the case nonetheless was viewed as serious because of Rockwell's past promises not to violate the federal False Claims Act.    Rockwell's Satellite Systems division, based in Seal Beach, Calif., in 1982 signed a consent decree with the Justice Department, in which it agreed to an injunction against submitting false claims on government contracts. Under the decree, in which it neither admitted nor denied overcharging, it agreed to compensate the government $500,000. As part of a settlement of a civil fraud suit at that time, the Rockwell unit also agreed to spend $1 million on a computerized accounting system to prevent claims abuses. The alleged violations, if proved, could constitute a violation of the consent decreee.    In the current case, a spokesman for the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations in Washington confirmed that the Air Force conducted an investigation of the Rockwell unit and referred its findings to the U.S. attorney's office here. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment, citing a policy against discussing pending cases.    If Rockwell is indicted, the Air Force would further review the case to determine whether the company should be temporarily suspended from bidding on government contracts. Daniel Connors, general counsel to the Air Force's Suspension and Debarment Review Board, said the board had &quot;received information from Rockwell that they submitted in the hopes that we would not suspend them if an indictment were handed up.&quot; Mr. Connors declined to specify what information Rockwell submitted, but he said the board is still reviewing it.    In El Segundo, Calif., headquarters of Rockwell's aircraft and space operations, a company spokesman said, &quot;It would be inappropriate to comment on the matter at this time.&quot;    In November 1985, Pittsburgh-based Rockwell was temporarily suspended from receiving new defense contracts after it pleaded guilty in federal court in Dallas to 20 counts of submitting false billings on an Air Force spare-parts contract. Rockwell agreed to repay the government as much as $1.2 million and to forgo seeking reimbursement for $300,000 in contract costs. The ban on bidding for new contracts was lifted the following month.    Under the satellite program, known as the Navstar Global Positioning System, the Rockwell division is building 28 satellites for a total of $1.2 billion. The satellites, 18 of which will be placed in orbit, will be used by the military to send navigational directions to warplanes, naval vessels and ground troops. A Rockwell unit in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is building a system to monitor the satellites from the ground. It isn't known whether the Iowa unit also is a target of the investigation.    In the 1982 case, Rockwell settled civil charges that it improperly charged cost overruns from the Navstar satellite program, which was a fixed-price contract, to the Space Shuttle program. The Space Shuttle contract was &quot;cost-plus,&quot; meaning the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would pay for overruns.    The charges resulted from a three-year investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the NASA inspector general and government auditors, in conjunction with the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.    Rockwell's chairman, Robert Anderson, said at the time that the settlement was &quot;in the best interests of the company and of its employees in that it avoids what would be lengthy and disruptive litigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
