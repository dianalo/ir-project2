The Joint Economic Committee published a report last week raising doubts about whether the U.S. can be &quot;a great power and a great debtor at the same time.&quot; And Yale historian Paul Kennedy writes in the latest issue of The Atlantic Monthly that the &quot;American century&quot; is coming to an end.    Such hand-wringing seems strange in light of recent economic news. The bull market in stocks turned five years old last week, with a flourish. The economic expansion is also about to set a longevity record. And a recession is nowhere in sight.    Moreover, although the relative position of the U.S. in the world economy has declined, that's hardly surprising. Europe and Japan were devastated by World War II; some catching up was in order.    But many thoughtful observers believe some disturbing long-term currents run beneath the recent economic news. They see signs the nation is slipping into a British-style decline that will undermine its leading role in the world economy. &quot;Strong evidence points in that direction,&quot; says Charles Kindleberger, professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Much of the concern focuses on debt. America's pre-eminent place in the postwar economic system was based on its ability to export not only goods, but also money. The U.S. bankrolled the world. Now, however, a rapidly growing mountain of foreign debt has changed that.    The Joint Economic Committee calculates that U.S. financial debts to foreigners at the end of 1986 exceeded what foreigners owed here by a record $209 billion, which made America the world's biggest debtor. And the shortfall seems sure to get much worse. Even under optimistic forecasts, net debt owed to foreigners will swell to more than half a trillion dollars by the end of the decade. The likely result: a decline in America's ability to provide international economic leadership.    As the late economist Walter Heller said: &quot;You can't sit tall in the saddle when you owe everybody in town.&quot;    But debt is just part of the worry. Slow productivity growth, a plague since the late 1960s, remains a major problem. Mr. Kindleberger ticks off others: a slowdown in smokestack industry, a drop in savings, an unwillingness to pay taxes, a deteriorating infrastructure. Stanford economist Nathan Rosenberg maintains that the nation's technological prowess also lags. In 1986, for example, nearly half the patents given out by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office went to foreigners.    The rise and fall of nations is a topic eschewed by most economists nowadays. Generally, they focus instead on near-term developments and feel ill-equipped to deal with deeper questions of national character -- the collective hopes, fears and desires that may ultimately determine a nation's fate.    Mancur Olson, professor of economics at University of Maryland, is an exception. He argues that nations over time develop rigidities in their economic institutions -- a sort of national sclerosis -- that forces them into decline. Special-interest groups collude, create cartels and demand special treatment from government, all of which induces economic stagnation. This happened in Britain early in this century, Mr. Olson says, and is happening &quot;to a considerable degree&quot; in the U.S. now.    Some analysts say the causes of decline are rooted in the national psyche. In his book &quot;English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit,&quot; historian Martin Wiener describes how the very country that created the industrial revolution gradually lost interest in it. The sons of industrialists, educated in elite schools, yearned to be gentry and let Germany and the U.S. take the industrial lead.    To be sure, the U.S. and Britain are vastly different. But a process similar to that described by Mr. Wiener may be at work here. Mr. Olson wonders why so many of the nation's brightest become lawyers, &quot;engaged in very subtle complicated disputes and litigation with each other, rather than making the country work.&quot; And David Hale, a Chicago-based economist, worries that &quot;the huge concentration of people going into things like finance will make us a society that is good at administering wealth, rather than creating it.&quot; The course lists of many top business schools show lots of courses in marketing and finance, but hardly any in manufacturing.    For America to remain the world's premier industrial power, Mr. Rosenberg argues, Americans will have &quot;to be very single-minded, strongly committed. It may be that some of the intensity of our commitment is not what it used to be.&quot;    Still, the U.S. remains the leading economic power, retaining considerable vitality. The enormous U.S. market is one huge plus, in Mr. Olson's view. And Mr. Kindleberger points to vibrant new industries, like microbiology and genetic engineering.    In addition, the U.S. economy continues to demonstrate an ability to create new jobs that is the envy of the world. And while the nation's overall productivity is weak, manufacturers have made impressive strides during the last few years towards cutting costs and boosting efficiency.    &quot;There is no inevitability in decline,&quot; says Mr. Olson. &quot;If we understand it, if we don't make mistakes, we can remain the dominant country as far into the future as the eye can see.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
