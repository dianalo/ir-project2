Bruce McColm in the November-December Freedom at Issue magazine, put out by Freedom House:    At the heart of the upcoming debate lies the victory issue: Can the Nicaraguan democratic resistance win? But the way the question is posed usually obscures the proper response. Victory in a low-intensity war does not signify that the adversary has been militarily defeated; it is the confirmation that he is exhausted and bled dry, that he is psychologically defeated. The aim of a guerrilla war is to slowly, through single, small actions culminating in larger operations, erode the domestic and international perception of a government's legitimacy. Victory comes unnoticed through the backdoor in an unexpected moment when a regime collapses like a punctured balloon. </TEXT></DOC>
