Here, right beside it, is &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; without.;   Mozart's most perfect opera and its source, the revolutionary play by PierreAugustin Caron de Beaumarchais, are mirror images: complicated comediesfrosted with social relevance. Except for the music, there's little differencebetween &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Mariage de Figaro.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Arts andamp; Books  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE MESSAGE OF 'FIGARO': LOVE, HONOR, FORGIVENESS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Performing Arts / Essay  </MEMO><TEXT>     Why is it, then, that productions of the opera (a huge work and a musicalmine field) are common enough, while the play, a touchstone of Western drama,has never entered the standard repertory in English-speaking countries?;   Thanks to San Francisco's Mozart andamp; His Time festival, it's been possible tocompare the two and work out an answer. American Conservatory Theater producedBeaumarchais' play in May to lead off the festival; San Francisco Operafollows this month with the opera (through Friday).;    The brilliance ofMozart's &quot;Figaro&quot; begins with its libretto. Beaumarchais' play was brand-newand notorious in 1785 when Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte grabbed it for anopera. To their credit, they shied away from none of its seditious content:servants smarter than their masters, that sort of thing. It so alarmed LouisXVI that he was supposed to have said (prophetically, as it turned out): &quot;Ifwe allow this to be performed, they would tear down the Bastille.&quot;;    Notonly did da Ponte preserve the play's elaborate network of plots andcounterplots, he also retained a surprising amount of the text, bettering itin the process.;    Consider Cherubino, the lovesick page. In the play, hedescribes the glandular upheaval he experiences whenever a woman crosses hisline of sight: &quot;Upon my word, I don't know what's coming over me,&quot; he says (inthe standard translation by John Wood). &quot;My pulse quickens at the very sightof a woman. The word love makes my heart pound. In fact, I feel such a need tosay 'I love you' to someone that I catch myself saying it to myself, to you,to the trees, to the clouds, to the wind.&quot;;    Da Ponte split this gawkyrhapsody right down the middle. Where it occurs in Act 1, he provided aliteral translation and Mozart a conventional aria, &quot;Non so piu&quot; (&quot;I don'tknow what's happening to me&quot;) -- a charming song whose superficial energycomes from its lickety-split buffo (comic-opera) tempo.;    Then, in thesecond act, Cherubino gets another solo: a love song to the countess, whosmiles on his youthful ardor without knowing she's the object of it.Beaumarchais set the song as a roundelay -- the words are meaningless -- tothe tune of &quot;Malbrouck s'en va t'en Guerre,&quot; a popular French marching tunenow known, I am sorry to say, as &quot;The Bear Went Over the Mountain.&quot;;    DaPonte scrapped the roundelay.Going back to the giddy boy's first words, hefurnished Mozart with a new text, though still recognizably derived fromBeaumarchais. It is, of course, &quot;Voi, che sapete.&quot;;    This is an artlesslittle ballad, the song of a boy more in love with love than with anyparticular woman. It's sung to one of Mozart's prettiest accompaniments, inwhich pizzicato (plucked) strings in the orchestra conjure up the lute thatSusanna pretends to play on stage.;    Here Cherubino's inner turmoiloverwhelms him, and he sings (in my translation): &quot;I'm chilled, then I burn,in the next moment, I congeal again. I search for something, I know not what.I sigh and moan, quite without will; I tremble and my heart races, withoutknowing why. I have no peace, night or day.&quot;;    The Italian text manufacturesits own poetic sense with a pile-up of rapid-fire plosives and sibilants,consonants bumping against one another in zestful confusion, imitating theboy's wide-eyed wonder, knocking knees and short breath. The words also jumpthe measure lines, rushing ahead of their proper harmonies and waiting for themusic to catch up.;    Against this busy verbal activity, the accompaniment isan anchor. Where the harmonies begin to cramp and bunch up, a good performancewill compress the tempo, responding to Cherubino's mounting exaltation andmisery; but the steadying influence of the lute forces the boy back to earth,to reality.;    The music is the message; This push-pull of text andaccompaniment, harmony and rhythm, allows us to laugh at Cherubino and, at thesame time, with him. Not only does this not happen in the play, in which theboy is simply a plot device, but it also fulfills the highest purpose ofopera, which is to speak to all the senses at once.;    The countess, perhapsMozart's finest tragic creation, benefits from the same enrichment. WhereBeaumarchais drew, da Ponte and Mozart painted, and with a full palette ofcolor.;    Look at the finale: the play's weakest scene, the opera'smasterpiece. Beaumarchais badly short-changes the reconciliation of thecountess and her philandering husband; they resolve their differences in twolines of dialogue. In the opera, recognition is accomplished through a keychange. Harmonically speaking, the count is like a car roaring around a curveonly to find the countess planted there, like a large and gracious tree,forcing him to a halt.;    When the countess unmasks, there are six emptybeats and then a shocked whisper from the company. The count begs his wife'sforgiveness, and there's a long fermata (a hold) over a silence. Will she orwon't she? The harmonic direction tells us she will -- but the delayedresolution gives a poignant suspense to her decision that the play doesn'thave.;    Great opera on a human scale;  Then, when she pardons him, thecompany prolongs her gesture with a luminous slow chorus -- a wave ofcompassion (from the servants, no less) that leaves the count overwhelmed withshame. It's one of the loveliest, truest moments in opera, and it'saccomplished purely through music -- no words.;    Beaumarchais was arevolutionary in his play, but Mozart, whose politics are unknown to us, madehis opera a true creature of the Enlightenment.;    His &quot;Figaro&quot; is not aboutclass systems and social order; it's about an unhappy marriage and a happyone, and what they have to teach each other. It's one of the first operas tofocus on people, not deities, and to place them in their own world, not someheroic or mythic past. Opera on a human scale -- that's a really revolutionaryconcept, and vastly more resonant, to our time, than Beaumarchais' socialcriticism.;  The Marriage of Figaro; Music: W.A.
