<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-1100 </DOCNO><TEXT>According to the latest environmental policy targets, the backfittingof conventional power plant with flue gas purification systems for NO/subx/ removal down to the reference limits set by the Conference of Ministersfor Environmental Affairs is to be concluded by the end of 1989. Forthe VKR, this means that 25 boiler plants with a total installed capacityof 5000 MW - predominantly with low-grade coal firing - have to be backfittedby this date. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) seems to be the bestavailable method today for this purpose. In a first phase, eight pilotplants, each with a flue gas flow rate of 1 600 m/sup 3//h but with varyingflue gas compositions, have been put into operation in the period 1984/1985.In the district heat producing power plant at Buer, the boiler plantunder construction, designed for low-grade coal firing and dry ash removal,has been equipped with a system capable of cleaning the total flue gasemission of 500 000 m/sup 3//h. Due to headend measures taken, the NO/subx/ content fed to the catalysts is about 800 mg/m/sup 3/ (6% O/sub 2/),at flue gas temperatures of about 350/sup 0/C. The designed purificationefficiency of 75% is achieved by three catalyst beds of 1 m thicknesseach, representing a total of about 180 m/sup 3/ of the honeycomb catalystmaterial. The residence time of the first material is planned to be 16000 hours, and the second, after exchange of one of the three beds, isplanned to be 8000 hours. The catalyst system has first taken up operationin December 1985 and currently has been working for 8000 operating hours.</TEXT></DOC>
