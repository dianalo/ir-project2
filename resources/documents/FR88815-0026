We propose to extend V-220from Meeker to Grand Junction, CO, via a south dogleg. This action wouldimprove traffic flow in snow country airports located in the vicinity ofAspen, CO. These changes also support terminal procedures by providingmissed approach routes to holding on en route fixes. This action improvesflight planning and increases airport capacity during instrument weatherconditions. Section 71.123 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6D dated January 4, 1988.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, VOR Federal airways.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
