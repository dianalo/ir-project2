Results on the spectral shape for the elementsC, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe, obtained from this experiment, are presented.It was found that the C and O energy spectra retain a power-law spectrumin energy with an exponent Gamma of about 2.65. The Fe spectrum is flatter(Gamma of about 2.55) up to a particle energy of about 10 to the 14theV, indicating a steady increase in the relative abundance of iron incosmic rays up to this energy. The energy spectra of Ne, Mg, and Si aresteeper than anticipated. This behavior is unexpected within currentmodels of cosmic-ray acceleration. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
