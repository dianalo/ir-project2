The Fremont, Calif., computer and computer-peripheral maker said its net income was $6.7 million in the quarter, or 28 cents a share, up from $2.9 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $97.4 million from $78.9 million.    The company said net for the year was $21.3 million, or 91 cents a share, up 103% from $10.5 million, or 45 cents a share, in 1988. Sales rose to $377.3 million from $266.7 million.    Everex attributed the sharp profit rise to increased sales of its own brand of computers, particularly its high-end desktop computers based on Intel Corp.'s 80386 and 80386SX microprocessor chips. </TEXT></DOC>
