Interested persons were invited to submit comments, suggestionsor objections by August 17, 1989. Comments were received from nineteenindividuals and organizations. Commenters included the senior Senator fromNew York, the junior Senator from South Dakota, the American Legion, theVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, the Disabled American Veterans,the National Veterans Legal Services Project, Inc., representing the VietnamVeterans of America, the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition, the OklahomaAgent Orange Foundation, the State of Minnesota Department of VeteransAffairs and ten members of the general public.In addition, a special session of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on EnvironmentalHazards was convened on September 8, 1989. The Committee received an oralpresentation by four individuals representing the views of the AmericanLegion. (The Committee has received oral presentations from a number ofindividuals and organizations in the past and will continue to do so solong as adequate advance notice is provided for scheduling purposes.) TheCommittee also reviewed all of the comments received and offered theirviews on them. The Committee made a number of recommendations, some inresponse to the oral presentation made at this meeting by representativesof the American Legion and others in response to the written comments thatwere reviewed. The comments are summarized below together with VA's responseand any indicated amendatory action.Five commenters from Des Moines, Iowa, requested an extension of the timelimit for submitting comments on the proposed changes asserting that theestablished 30-day period was insufficient. Thirty days is a typical lengthof time for a comment period in the rulemaking process, especially whererules governing veterans' benfits are concerned. In addition, a significantnumber of comments were received within the comment period. Further, VAdesires to move as swiftly as possible to establish new study evaluationcriteria, review the scientific literature and determine whether therecurrently exists sound scientific and medical evidence that demonstratesa significant statistical association between dioxin or radiation exposureand any diseases. We decline, therefore, to extend the comment period.Many commenters addressed issues that were clearly outside the scope ofthis rulemaking proceeding. Such issues included the composition, membershipand alleged bias of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards,various comments concerning 38 CFR 1.17(b) and 3.311a for which no changeswere proposed, the frequency of VA's publication of study evaluations,consideration of defoliants other than those containing dioxin, objectionto the decision not to appeal the court ruling which prompted this rulemaking,assertion that all veterans exposed to Agent Orange should receive somepayment from VA and comments concerning claims of specific individuals.Some of these comments could be addressed through administrative procedureswhile others would require legislative action, but all are outside thescope of the original proposal. Consequently, these will not be addressedin this rulemaking proceeding.Three veterans' organizations and one individual suggested that the proposedcriteria for defining the term ``significant statistical association''were too strict or that VA should adopt the criteria already developedby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer (IARC) as indicative of such an association. Thecriteria set forth by the EPA (Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment,(51 FR 33992-34003 (1986)) and the IARC (IARC Monographs on the Evaluationof the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans, Supplement 4 (1982) andSupplement 7 (1987)) are designed to assess the carcinogenic potentialof a particular agent. This process of risk assessment attempts to determinethe likelihood that exposure to a specific agent will result in the futuredevelopment of a certain adverse health effect. The identification of apossible adverse health consequence through the use of either or both humanand animal models is the goal of the risk assessment matrix. Its purposeis to serve as the basis for the elimination or lessening of the possibleadverse health effect. VA, on the other hand, is attempting to determinethe likelihood that a presently existing disease is associated with a priorexposure to a specific agent. In doing so, it is concerned with more thana mere possibility that an effect is associated with a past exposure. Rather,it must determine whether it is at least as likely as not that a significantstatistical association exists. Consequently, it would not be appropriateto rely upon an approach designed to identify merely possible risks; adifferent standard must be employed to accomplish VA's task. As describedbelow, VA has looked to the models cited in its attempt to draft a scientificallyvalid and acceptable standard and utilized them where appropriate.Further, certain of these commenters suggest VA should adopt the standardarticulated by IARC that, in the absence of adequate human data, if studiesshow evidence of a particular agent's carcinogenicity in animal species,it is prudent to regard such agents ``as if they presented a carcinogenicrisk to humans.'' The Advisory Committee had previously considered theapplicability of animal data to human experience and did so extensivelyat its September 8, 1989, meeting. The Committee has noted the widespreadvariations in observed effects in animals both within the same speciesand among different species. Other factors such as the dose of exposureand the methods and durations of exposure employed in animal models alsoplay a role in judging the true applicability of animal results. For thesereasons, VA does not believe it would be appropriate to adopt the IARCmodel, especially those portions which would apply ``in the absence ofadequate human data.'' As will be discussed later, however, the Committeehas articulated what it considers to be a proper role for animal data toplay in VA's attempt to determine the human's response to exposure. The proposed criteria have been criticized as being too strict becausetheir language is similar to that employed by IARC for determining a causualassociation.\1\<NOTE/> VA's advisory committee commented, however, that the criteriaset forth are those which are generally accepted by the scientific communityin evaluating any study. That is, the Committee advised that there arecertain minimal standards which must be met for any scientific study tobe considered valid. These standards are the same whether a study purportsto establish a causual association or a statistical association. Furthermore,VA notes that a complete reading of the cited IARC monograph page showsthat much more is generally needed to infer causal association. The additionalfactors listed were the existence of several concordant studies which showan association, a showing of strong association, a dose-response relationship,and a reduction of cancer incidence with a reduction in exposure. Noneof these additional criteria are required for a finding of significantstatistical association under VA's proposed rule. Additionally, it shouldbe noted that the application of these criteria, when met, must resultin the finding of a significant statistical association. Moreover, thebenefit of the doubt rule will be applied by the Secretary to the evaluationof the weight of the scientific evidence. Thus, if there is an approximatebalance of positive and negative evidence regarding the association betweendioxin and an illness or condition, the benefit of the doubt will be givento the conclusion that the association exists. Studies that do not satisfythese threshold criteria may still contribute to the body of scientificand medical evidence which, in the Secretary's judgment (under proposedparagraph (e)), may warrant a finding of significant statistical association.When read together, VA does not believe that proposed paragraphs (d) and(e) constitute a standard which is too strict. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The IARC monograph states: ``Three criteria must be metbefore a causual association can be inferred between exposure and cancerin humans: <ITAG tagnum="28">1. Three is no identified bias which could explain the association.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">2. The possibility of confounding has been considered and ruled outas explaining the association. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">3. The association is unlikely to be due to chance.'' </ITAG>One commenter suggested that VA was introducing a ``null hypothesis'' whereby``it is assumed that the relationship does not exist unless there is enoughscientific evidence to satisfy a rigorous standard that it does exist.''To the extent that this comment suggests that a significant statisticalassociation should be assumed to exist regardless of whether there areany studies which adequately support such a relationship, VA disagrees.First, and foremost, VA does not start with any presumption concerninga disease's association with exposure. Rather, it begins from a neutralposition and then seeks to determine the existence of valid positive andvalid negative studies. The relative weights of the valid positive andvalid negative studies, with the application of the reasonable doubt doctrine,will determine the eventual conclusion. Thus, the regulation does not establishan overly rigorous standard but properly requires that a significant statisticalassociation be established consistent with Public Law 98-542.Two veterans' organizations asserted that VA should review the resultsof dioxin studies involving laboratory animals and not confine itself toreviewing studies on the adverse health effects of dioxin exposure in humans.The issue of the value of animal studies was also raised by one of theorganizations in support of an objection to the proposed change to paragraph(a). That commenter suggested that limiting the studies reviewed to thoseinvolving only herbicide exposure would be too restrictive and would bean additional basis for not reviewing studies on laboratory animals. Atthe same time, an individual commenter supported this change to paragraph(a) indicating that exposure to the herbicide, and not just one of itscomponents or contaminants, was the key issue.Valid epidemiologic studies constitute that most direct and convincingevidence regarding exposure to some agent and association with adversehuman health effects. Animal and mechanistic studies provide less directevidence in determining the likelihood that a presently existing diseaseis associated with past exposure to a specific agent, but may provide supportiveand supplemental information in evaluation of the weight of evidence ofassociation with adverse human health effects.To assure that relevant scientific information on any specific issue isconsidered, we are adding a new paragraph (e) to the proposed rule settingforth the additional types of studies which may contain supportive or supplementalinformation and which may be considered in assessing the relative weightto be accorded the various valid studies being reviewed. The types of evidenceto be considered under new paragraph (e) would include case series (reportsof individual cases unrelated to a specific scientific study), correlationalstudies (studies showing that a temporal or other association between twoevents is present), studies with insufficient power, animal studies andmechanistic studies (studies of the cellular or molecular response to anexposure).In response to the comments concerning the revision to paragraph (a), VAnotes that the purpose of the proposal was simply to track more closelythe statutory charge in Public Law 98-542, the Veterans' Dioxin and RadiationExposure Compensation Standards Act. Section 5 of that law, which setsforth the requirement for and content of regulations, clearly speaks interms of ``guidelines governing the evaluation of the findings of scientificstudies relating to the possible increased risk of adverse health effectsof exposure to herbicides containing dioxin * * *.'' Thus the languageof the regulation is faithful to the language of the law. For purposesof grammatical accuracy, however, we are substituting the words ``and/orexposure to'' for the word ``or'' immediately following the parenthetical``(dioxin)'' in paragraph (a). The change is not intended to restrict thescope of studies to be reviewed and evaluated concerning the issue of adversehealth effects related to exposure to herbicides containing dioxin. Two veterans' organizations and one legislator expressed support for proposedparagraph (e) (redesignated as (f)), but one suggested it could be strengthenedby permitting consideration of animal studies. Because the formulationof that paragraph is such as to permit consideration of <T3>any </T3>relevant scientific and medical evidence, we perceive no benefitin referencing one particular type of evidence. Further, as noted abovewith respect to new paragraph (e), animal studies as well as other relevantstudies may be considered in conjunction with valid scientific studiesas defined in paragraph (d). One veterans' organization and one legislator suggested with regard toproposed paragraph (d)(2)(ii) that study biases should not be assumed inthe absence of specific evidence of their presence or that they shouldbe permitted to exist if they are satisfactorily accounted for. Neitherthe presence nor the absence of a bias is assumed. Further, the proposedlanguage only requires that a study be reasonably free of biases and thatif biases are found to exist, the investigator acknowledge them and explainhow they were taken into account in arriving at the study's conclusions.Reviewers should not be prohibited from suggesting that a particular studymethodology may have introduced a bias not accounted for by the investigator.However, we agree that where bias is identified, it should not invalidatea study if it can be shown that the bias did not affect the study's conclusions.To accommodate this suggestion we have amended paragraph (d)(2)(ii), withthe concurrence of the Advisory Committee, to read as follows: ``Is reasonablyfree of biases, such as selection, observation and participation biases;however, if biases exist, the investigator has acknowledged them and sostated the study's conclusions that the biases do not intrude upon thoseconclusions; and''. Two veterans' organizations sought clarification of the terms ``positive''and ``negative'' with reference to the scientific studies being reviewed.One of those commenters suggested that studies which contain misleadingstatements or which depart from established scientific standards shouldbe eliminated from consideration even before they are designated as ``positive''or ``negative''. The terms ``positive'' and ``negative'' with regard tostudies are well-understood by scientific investigators and represent generalcharacterizations of studies depending on their findings or lack of findings.A study is ``positive'' if it finds a correlation the study was designedto detect. A study is ``negative'' if it did not find a correlation thestudy was designed to detect. The screening factors suggested by the commentercould be considered in assessing the validity of a study, but not whetherthe study should be considered at all.One State veterans' organization conceded that the study evaluation processwas ultimately subjective in nature and did not lend itself to completeobjectivity but suggested that the process might be more open if additionalfactors were considered during the study evaluation process and some termswere clarified. The commenter suggested four terms for clarification. Threeof those terms (peer review, replicability and the veteran population ofinterest) are contained in paragraph (b) of the rule which is not a subjectof this rulemaking proceeding. The fourth term (relative weights of studies)is a term which cannot be quantified but which relies heavily on the subjectiveconsideration of experienced scientific investigators.Several of the additional factors suggested for consideration during theprocess of evaluating epidemiological findings were already included inproposed paragraph (d), i.e., statistical significance, study design andbias. Other suggested factors such as dose-response relationships, theconsistency and reproducibility of results, the strength and specificityof the association and its biological significance, that relate to thedetermination of causality in epidemiology, are not required or determinativefor finding significant statistical association, but may be consideredin evaluating the relative weights of studies.One veterans' organization and one legislator addressed the requirementin proposed paragraph (d)(3) that positive studies be statistically significantat a probability level of .05 or less. They indicated that this requirementshould not ``pre-eliminate'' studies, should apply equally to negativestudies and, in any event, should probably be raised to .10 or less. Whilethis requirement could prevent a study from being considered as a validpositive study for purposes of paragraph (d), it would not preclude or``pre-eliminate'' it from consideration under paragraph (e) or (f) togetherwith other scientific and medical evidence on the same subject. This requirementis not applicable to negative studies because it requires that there bea one-in-twenty chance or less that an apparent positive association isdue to chance alone. It is not, therefore, calculated with respect to negativefindings. Finally, our Advisory Committee has advised that .05 is the mostaccepted probability value with or without a prior hypothesis. For thesereasons we find no basis for changing the proposal.One individual commeter suggested that ``significant statistical association''was a straightforward mathematical calculation. We believe the commenterwas confusing that term with the term ``statistical significance'' whichis a mathematical calculation and which is considered under paragraph (d)(3).One veterans' organization suggested a mathematical formula for weightingpositive and negative studies and suggested its inclusion in paragraph(d)(4). We agree that the statistical power of negative studies shouldbe used in balancing them with positive studies, but use of the mathematicalequation proposed is only applicable when two or more studies are identical,or nearly so, with at least one being positive and one being negative.Such an equation would be useful for evaluating laboratory studies, butepidemiological studies unfortunately lack such uniformity.One veterans' organization suggested that proposed paragraph (c) be amendedby adding the phrase ``it is at least as likely as not that'' before thephrase ``a significant statistical association exists * * *'' We cannotagree. The language suggested for addition is the key language used inapplying the reasonable doubt doctrine. As reflected in proposed paragraph(c), that doctrine is applied in determining the existence of a significantstatistical association under the provisions of proposed paragraph (d)(1),and that is where that reasonable doubt language should and does appear.The same commenter suggested that some high risk subgroups might be unethicallyexcluded from consideration in a study's conclusions because such thingsas the possibility of synergistic disease-provoking mechanisms or impairmentof the immune system might be viewed as confounding factors for which theinvestigator had to ``correct.'' We do not agree. The proposed rule doesnot require correction for possible confounders but rather a satisfactoryaccounting for known confounders. Under this more liberal constructiona valid study is permitted to include confounding factors if they are notedand satisfactorily explained in relation to the study's conclusions.The interest expressed by both individual and organizational commentersis appreciated. Except as noted herein, the amendments to 38 CFR 1.17 areadopted as proposed.The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directlyaffect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from theinitial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretaryhas determined that this regulatory amendment is non-major for the followingreasons.(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore.(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.<ITAG tagnum="20">(The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104,64.105, 64.109, and 64.110)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 1</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, claims.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: September 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
