<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0287 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Chernobyl nuclear power station accident released large quantitiesof vaporized radionuclides, and, to a lesser extent, mechanically releasedsmall (andless; 1-10 {mu}m) aerosol particles. Chernobyl-derived radionuclidescan be used as transient tracers to study physical and biogeochemicalprocesses. Initial measurements of fallout Chernobyl radionuclides froma time-series sediment trap at 1,071 m during June-September 1986 inthe southern Black Sea are presented. The specific activities of /sup137/Cs, /sup 144/Ce and /sup 106/Ru in the trap samples are independentof the particle flux while their relative activities reflect their ratesof scavenging in the order Ce andgt; Ru andgt; Cs.</TEXT></DOC>
