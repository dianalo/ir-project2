Violence broke out Friday during protests over PLO militarychief Khalil Wazir's slaying, and Israeli soldiers killed two Arabsand wounded at least 36 in the occupied territories. In Jersualem,police battled rioting Moslem worshipers on the sacred Temple Mount.   The curfew, imposed on Monday, covered the West Bank towns ofAnabta and Nablus _ the area's largest town with more than 100,000population _ and 20 Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank andGaza Strip.   A total of 400,000 people were under curfew, according to Israelradio.   Arab ringleaders threatened to take revenge on merchants whodefied Palestine Liberation Organization orders to strike andcalled on Arabs to turn the Moslem holy month of Ramadan into ``amonth of fury.''   Wazir, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Jihad, was killedone week ago at his Tunis home by commandos said to be Israeli.   In the West Bank village of Idna near Hebron, soldiers killed a28-year-old Arab Friday who tried to attack a border policeman witha nail-studded club, the army said.   Military officials said troops had entered Idna to search thevillage.   In the Gaza town of Khan Yunis, 25-year-old Fayez Abu Ali diedof a bullet wound to the head Friday, Nasser Hospital officialssaid. The army said he was shot when troops fired on a car tryingto run over them.   The fatalities brought to 171 the number of Palestinians killedsince unrest began Dec. 8 in territories Israel captured in the1967 Middle East war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish girl settlerhave also been killed.   The Temple Mount riot followed prayers on the first Friday ofRamadan attended by about 10,000 worshipers at the Al Aqsa mosqueand the Dome of the Rock, where Moslems believe the prophetMohammed ascended to heaven.   Police fired rubber bullets and swung truncheons to dispersehundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators.   The Arabs carried outlawed Palestinian flags and black bannersand chanted, ``With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge AbuJihad!''   Rubber bullets and beatings injured six Arabs and stones woundedfive policemen at the site, which is also sacred to Jews who saythe Second Temple stood there until Romans destroyed it in 70 A.D.   More than 30 protesters were arrested, police said.   Israel TV showed two protesters being carried out on stretchers.   Leaftets bearing Wazir's picture and calling for more proteststoday were distributed at West Bank mosques. Underground leadersordered Arabs to step up attacks with ``stones, gasoline bombs,metal balls and slingshots.''   Also Friday, Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian guerrillabases in seaside hills south of Beirut in the sixth such raid intoLebanon this year. Police said at least one fighter was killed andeight wounded.   After noon Moslem prayers, Israeli soldiers clashed withprotesters at several sites in the Gaza Strip.   At Jabaliya refugee camp, 12 Arabs were wounded when soldiersfired on protesters, and 18 others were hurt by rubber bullets andbeatings, U.N. and hospital officials said. Israel radio said 12people were hurt.   The army said soldiers used live ammunition after Jabaliyaresidents defied a curfew and tear gas and rubber bullets failed todisperse the crowd.   Outside Omari Mosque in Gaza City, Israeli troops hurled teargas canisters and fired in the air when about 200 Palestinianyouths left prayers to throw rocks and chant, Arab witnesses said.   In Ramallah and neighboring El Bireh on the West Bank, Israelitroops patrolled the streets in trucks and jeeps. On the walls werefreshly painted slogans calling for avenging the death of Wazir.   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank's militaryadministration, said on Israel TV that the curfews in the occupiedlands would ``continue until we become convinced that the area willreturn to normal life.''   At the United Nations headquarters in New York, SovietAmbassador Alexander Belonogov on Friday accused Israel of stateterrorism in Wazir's death.   He told the U.N. Security Council, ``It is but another exampleof Israel's cynical contempt for world public opinion.''</TEXT></DOC>
