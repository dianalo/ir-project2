The approval came against a background of intense competitionbetween Airbus and U.S. aircraft makers, who complain that thecompany sells planes more cheaply because of unfair government aid.Airbus denies the accusations but has been under increased internalpressure to become more efficient.   British Trade and Industry Minister Kenneth Clarke, SpanishIndustry Minister Luis Carlos Croissier, German Economy MinistryState Secretary Erich Riedl and French Transport Minister JacquesDouffiagues approved the guidelines, contained in a reportpresented by four consultants, one from each country, calling forfundamental management changes.   Clarke told a news conference the ministers reached what hecalled surprisingly speedy agreement on the need for a managementrestructuring aimed at cutting costs, clarifying costs andexpenses, accelerating decision-making and running the operation``on clear commercial lines.''   The report asserts that despite an increase in production andsales, Airbus Industrie had failed to reduce costs and increaseefficiency.   Based in Toulouse, France, Airbus was created in 1970 by theFrench firm Aerospatiale, British Aerospace PLC,Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany and ConstruccionesAeronauticas S.A. (CASA) of Spain, with the aid of the governmentsof Britain, West Germany, France and Spain.   Aerospatiale and MBB GmbH each own 37.9 percent of Airbus, whileBritish Aerospace owns 20 percent and CASA 4.2 percent. Combinedassets of the consortium exceed $12 billion.   Riedl called the general agreement Tueday among the officials``a giant step forward.''   ``Airbus Industrie's pioneer stage is now something we'vedefinitely left behind. Airbus has come of age,'' he said.   The officials called for Airbus and its industrial partners topresent detailed plans of action to implement the recommendationsat a meeting May 5 in Hannover, West Germany.   Croissier said the officials did not discuss U.S. officials'accusations of unfair government subsidies to Airbus in the Tuesdaymeeting, but said recent talks between European Economic Communityofficials and U.S. trade officials had led to a better climate.   Clarke said the four governments aimed to revamp Airbus'management structure ``so that government support is reduced.''   Airbus has received orders for more than 1,000 aircraft,including from five of the top 10 U.S. airlines, and carved out anestimated 20 percent share of the world jetliner business,competing against U.S. builders Boeing Co. and McDonnell DouglasCorp., which dominate the industry.   The treasuries of Britain, France and West Germany financeddevelopment of two new Airbus models, but now the governmentsbelieve it is time the consortium begins to function like a publiccompany.   Clarke said the importance of the accord to overhaul Airbusmanagement structure is that ``Airbus will have to become a projecteconomically feasible on its own.''   Croissier called Airbus Industrie ``by far the most succesfulEuropean industrial cooperation project.''   The so-called ``Four Wise Men's report'' the officials approvedTuesday called for turning the Airbus consortium into a publiclimited company by 1992; revamping the supervisory board toincrease policy control; and creating a financial director post toaccount for program costs, profits and losses.</TEXT></DOC>
