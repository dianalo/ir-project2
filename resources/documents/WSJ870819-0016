As previously reported, the Canadian government earlier this week ordered the banks to more than double their current loan-loss provisions to between 30% and 40% of all loans outstanding to 34 less-developed countries. The required increase varies with each bank, and the government hasn't disclosed individual bank guidelines.    Canada's eight domestic banks currently have provisions for about 15% of their 25 billion Canadian dollars of loans ($18.8 billion) to the 34 countries. To comply with the mandatory provisions, analysts estimate the country's banks will increase their loan-loss reserves by between 4.5 billion dollars and 7 billion dollars in fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31.    The government has given banks until Oct. 31 to increase their provisions, but most are expected to meet the new guidelines by reporting a special after-tax charge for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31.    Patricia Meredith, a banking analyst with Wood Gundy Inc., estimates that Canada's six largest banks will report a total after-tax charge of 3.42 billion dollars for the third quarter to meet the new reserve guidelines. The estimated charge exceeds the total 2.11 billion dollar profit the six banks had in fiscal 1986.    &quot;It's unavoidable that most of the banks will be reporting big losses for the year,&quot; Ms. Meredith said.    Montreal-based Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal are expected to report the largest losses because they have the most loans outstanding to less-developed countries.    Assuming banks will increase their loan-loss reserves to 35%, Ms. Meredith estimates Royal Bank will report an 820 million dollar charge for its third quarter. In fiscal 1986, the bank had net income of 489 million dollars. Royal Bank declined to comment on the forecast.    The Bank of Montreal said it expects to report a charge of 753 million dollars for the third quarter. The bank earned 353 million dollars in fiscal 1986.    The banks' third-quarter results are expected within the next two weeks.    The increase in loan-loss reserves was prompted by a similar trend in the U.S. after Citicorp announced in May a $3 billion addition to its reserves for questionable debt of developing nations. Whereas Citicorp's move sparked a rally in U.S. banking stocks because of renewed investor confidence in bank stability, Canadian bank stocks remained largely unchanged yesterday.    Terry Shaunessy, a banking analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Canadian unit, said the lack of investor enthusiasm reflects concerns that most banks will have to raise additional equity to absorb the losses. &quot;The new provisions are a positive move, but the financing requirements for some of the banks will be so high that it will choke any rally in the stock market,&quot; he said.    The anticipated losses come at a time when most Canadian banks are launching acquisitions and expanding to take advantage of the recent deregulation of the country's financial services sector. Wood Gundy's Ms. Meredith estimates banks will need to issue more than 1 billion dollars in new equity over the next year as a result of the losses and expansion.    ---          Canadian Banks' New Loan Loss Provisions             (In millions of Canadian dollars)                            REQUIRED NEW         ESTIMATED                               LOAN-LOSS    3rd QTR.
