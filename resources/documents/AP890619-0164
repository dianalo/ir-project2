Sudan saidit arrested 66 people in the plot.   Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi told Parliament in Khartoumon Monday that the plot was aimed at ``manslaughter in Parliament''and at ``uprooting the democratic system in Sudan and serving thestrategies of other countries.''   Mahdi did not identify the countries but assailed ``the feverishactivities of the bloodthirsty Nimeiri in Egypt.''   Nimeiri said from his exile home in Cairo that the conspiracystory was invented to divert the Sudanese people's attention fromtheir problems.   Sudan's military command said Sunday that soldiers and civiliansloyal to Nimeiri were arrested after the plot was discovered. Itimplied but did not say their aim was to restore power to the formermilitary ruler ousted on April 6, 1985.   Mahdi said his government ``will promptly and harshly deal withthis coup attempt ... whatever be the price.''   His security adviser, Abdel Rahman Faraha, said 18 military menand 48 civilians were arrested in connection with the plot.   Sudanese newspapers said earlier Monday that 14 army officers,including six brigadiers and two colonels, and 48 civilians werearrested. One newspaper, Al-Sudani, said a lieutenant general headedthe plotters and remained at large.   Editor Sidahmed Khalifa reportedly was arrested. His newspaper,Al-Watan, recently published an interview with Nimeiri and saidNimeiri would return in two weeks.   Newspapers quoted security sources as saying the plotters plannedto strike Monday as Mahdi addressed Parliament. They said the planwas to surround the assembly building with demonstrators, thenarrest senior government officials trapped inside.   Nimeiri scoffed at the reports.   ``This is a poor plan by the government, which is trying todivert the masses from their suffering,'' he said in an interview.``The government is trying to increase prices again, and they wantto divert the people's attention.''   Nimeiri said he was told Sudan's Interior Ministry for weekscompiled lists of his supporters, intending to arrest them oncharges of trying to overthrow the government.   ``They are always arresting people I knew,'' he said. ``Sixmonths ago, they arrested a southern man who used to help my formerchef. They also detained a former butler, and five or six distantlyrelated relatives of mine.''   Nimeiri ruled Sudan in a mostly pro-Western military dictatorshipfor 16 years. He contends he enjoys widespread civilian and militarysupport at home, although none is evident.   ``The masses are calling for the return of Nimeiri ... becausethey know maybe I can help them,'' he said.   But ``I am not trying to overthrow the government,'' he said.   Nevertheless, Nimeiri said this month that he sent tapes andcopies of speeches to Sudan in May urging the Sudanese to overthrowMahdi's civilian administration, which he called a ``government ofthieves.''   Sudan's economy is in a shambles because of a $13 billion foreigndebt and southern civil war costing $1 million a day.   Many small demonstrations protesting inflation and commodityshortages have occurred in recent days, including Sunday before thecoup plot announcement.   Demonstrators on Sunday urged a return to military rule unlesssupplies of bread and sugar are increased.</TEXT></DOC>
