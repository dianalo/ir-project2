In one sense, of course, it's surprising that the Vice President would choose to yank someone up from the minors when seasoned GOP stars were clearly available. The 41-year-old Mr. Quayle shares, for example, most of the convictions of Rep. Jack Kemp, whose consistent batting average and free-market evangelism have made him the George Brett of a new generation of Republican talent. That Mr. Bush preferred a protege over the pathmaker suggests the Vice President is willing to sacrifice individual brilliance to team loyalty -- and may also say something about his willingness to lead strong-minded peers.    That said, Mr. Quayle has clearly shown he can learn fast. In 12 years in Congress -- and especially from his Armed Services Committee post in the Senate -- Mr. Quayle has made himself an intelligent advocate of U.S. defense. His knowledge of the details of strategy has led him to support such valuable but arcane high-technology weapons as conventionally armed cruise missiles. These have potential to enhance NATO deterrence even as they reduce defense costs.    Mr. Quayle also supports the strategic defense initiative, and has been ahead of his colleagues in warning of the dangers to the U.S. from the spread of ballistic missiles through the Third World. Both themes have begun showing up in Mr. Bush's speeches, a sign of how much the Vice President trusts the Senator's advice. The Republicans plan to make foreign and defense policy central to their campaign, of course, and Mr. Quayle is well prepared for that task.    On other issues, Mr. Quayle more or less shares the &quot;conservative&quot; views of President Reagan, whose landslide in 1980 helped him defeat incumbent Birch Bayh. Like the GOP platform, Mr. Quayle's selection as the vice-presidential nominee illustrates the degree to which Republicans have united around Mr. Reagan's ideas. Michael Dukakis's campaign manager, Susan Estrich, has already accused Mr. Bush of giving in to the conservatives, though Mr. Quayle's views are a lot closer to Democratic vice-presidential candidate Bentsen's than Michael Dukakis's are. Mr. Quayle falls comfort ably within what has become the center-right main stream of U.S. politics.    Mr. Quayle's contribution to the GOP ticket will lie in how well he articulates these mainstream principles, and not in whether his choice represents any &quot;bold stroke across generations&quot; (as Bush campaign chairman James Baker put it Tuesday). Generational politics is a cliche for people with nothing else to say. Its premier Democratic practitioners, Joseph Biden and Gary Hart, flamed out early during the presidential campaign, while the oldest President in U.S. history, Ronald Reagan, has helped make the GOP the majority party among Americans under age 30. Ideas matter more than hairlines and wrinkles, whatever image-makers say.    Senator Quayle the political phenom will now have his chance to prove he can be an &quot;impact&quot; player in the majors. He's now in what everyone on the Durham Bulls called &quot;the show,&quot; and to play in this league he has first of all to keep in mind the ideas and policies that have helped yank him there. </TEXT></DOC>
