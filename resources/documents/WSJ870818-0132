BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   The Maine state prison in Thomaston is being accused of pulling a con job.    Seems the prison operates a showroom where it sells things made by prisoners in vocational projects. These items -- lamps, cutting boards and the like -- are quite a hit with the tourists traveling through town. The store is even a regular stop for some tour buses.    Part of the items' appeal is the stamp on them: &quot;Made by Inmate. Maine State Prison.&quot;    But, as it turns out, not everything is actually made by the prisoners.    The chairs, for example. Bradco Industries in Lisbon, Maine, sells unfinished chairs to the prison. Some are then finished by inmates and have been given the &quot;Made by Inmate&quot; stamp. The prison store also sells the unfinished chairs, which aren't worked on by inmates at all. But the unfinished chairs aren't stamped, and buyers are told that prisoners haven't worked on them, say officials of the 480-inmate, maximum-security institution.    After an inmate spilled the beans to a newspaper earlier this month, editorial writers across Maine reacted with indignation. (After all, this is a state so opposed to hypocrisy that it halted its own billboard tourism ads in Massachusetts, since Maine itself bans all billboards.)    &quot;The very last thing a prison inmate needs is a refresher course in deception,&quot; harrumphed the Portland Press Herald.    &quot;You would think we were smuggling guns to the contras in the legs of these chairs,&quot; says Donald Allen, commissioner of the Department of Corrections. &quot;It's a crock of baloney&quot; to say &quot;we are deceiving the public.&quot;    The problem is that state law requires that all products worked on by inmates be so identified. When the prison gave up making chairs on its outmoded machines several years ago and started selling the non-prison furniture, the state attorney general's office advised it to continue using the stamp, even if inmates merely finished the pieces, Mr. Allen says.    &quot;We weren't totally comfortable, because we knew that technically it was manufactured outside,&quot; he adds.    After the recent publicity, an assistant attorney general talked to the consumer fraud division and decided the label should be modified. The prison has now ordered a special stamp to specify that the chairs are &quot;partially manufactured (finished) at the Maine State Prison.&quot;    Meanwhile, the prison store is using paper tags. </TEXT></DOC>
