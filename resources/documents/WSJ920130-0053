As part of the White House's budget proposal to Congress,the Internal Revenue Service would require charitableorganizations to file information returns for all donationsof $500 or more. The agency also is planning to reviseindividual tax-return forms to force filers to report thosecontributions separately so that IRS computers couldcross-check for cheaters.</LP><TEXT>   The problem, the Treasury Department says, is that filersaggregate donations on the IRS's Schedule A. That makes itimpossible for the government to distinguish betweencharitable donations and payments to those charities forgoods and services, which aren't tax deductible.   For example, the Treasury contends that it loses&quot;significant tax revenues&quot; when filers write checks tocharities for items they purchase at auctions but then takethe payment as a deductible contribution.   A separate proposal would encourage taxpayers to donateproperty to charity by broadening an exclusion of suchdonations under the alternative minimum tax.</TEXT></DOC>
