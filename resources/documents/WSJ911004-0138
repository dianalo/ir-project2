Unless, of course, you're willing to pay asmuch as seven times the official rate to get one on the blackmarket.   In Jakarta, Indonesia, things are much the same. As theyare in Malaysia and in the Philippines.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, throughout large parts of Asia, it's not so mucha question of &quot;Sorry, wrong number,&quot; as of &quot;Sorry, nonumber.&quot; Much of the region is woefully behind in modernizingits telecommunications system, and such shortfalls areaffecting its ability to attract and carry on business andinvigorate its economy.   &quot;Expectations are so low that big improvements in thephone system will come as a shock,&quot; says an Indonesianexecutive.   But one area's needs are another's opportunities, andAsia's needs are making it perhaps the world's most excitingmarket for sellers of telecommunications equipment. This yearalone, U.S., European and Japanese manufacturers will reapthe bulk of the US$20 billion in sales of telecommunicationsequipment to the area. And &quot;beyond the year 2000 is when thereal growth is coming,&quot; says Rolf Granstrom, managingdirector of Asian operations for Ericsson Communications (HK)Ltd., a subsidiary of Swedish-based Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson.   &quot;At that point, the Asian market will be comparable towhat the European market is today.&quot;   For most of the have-not nations, the problem is one ofeconomic growth outpacing the telecommunications systems. Inthe past decade, the Asian-Pacific region has recorded someof the highest growth rates in the world. The average annualrate of 11 Asian countries was 4.7% between 1985 and 1989,and the figure rose to 6% in 1990 alone.   But even with more money in state coffers, tens ofmillions of people in rural areas are cut off from urbancenters, while cities bursting at the seams still rely ontelephone systems installed 30 to 40 years ago.   Recently, in a bid to attract foreign investment,manufacturing and financial institutions, many countries inthe region have made telecommunications systems a nationalpriority. They include Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesiaand the Philippines. &quot;The country that has the besttelecommunications infrastructure will be best positioned todraw in foreign financial firms,&quot; says N. Ranjan Pal,director of country analysis and forecasting for BusinessInternational Asia/Pacific Ltd., a Hong Kong-based consultingfirm.   In addition, telecommunications development will furtherassist the trade boom within Asia. This intra-regional tradenow accounts for 38% of all Asian exports, according to JamesRiedel, an economist at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;Asia,&quot; hesays, &quot;is Asia's largest market for export.&quot;   State-of-the-art telecommunications systems, however, arenot unknown in Asia, and those of Japan, Hong Kong, Singaporeand South Korea can stand comparison with any systems in theworld. The region's telecommunications success stories areall products of government regulatory and financial support,but even so there is some movement toward more competition,which would widen the Asian market.   While the bulk of Asian orders are for basic equipment,demand for more-sophisticated gear -- such as fiber-opticcable, digital switches and cellular networks -- is expectedto sustain sales growth for years to come. In Asia &quot;we areexpecting 50% average annual growth in cellular-equipmentsales through 1993,&quot; says Ericsson's Mr. Granstrom. He notes,however, that sales are starting from a relatively low base.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. officials also see fastgrowth in the cellular market. The cellular business in Asiahas jump-started ATandamp;T's sales figures, says Richard Brandt,regional marketing vice president for ATandamp;T Asia/Pacific Inc.&quot;It's like a license to print money,&quot; he adds.   Because the majority of Asian telecommunications projectsare under either direct or indirect government control, mostof the competition exists between equipment suppliers such asATandamp;T, NEC Corp. and Ericsson -- rather than between companiesor consortia bidding to build and operate telecommunicationsnetworks within a country.   Despite the great need for modern telecommunicationssystems, these overseas companies find that winning acontract in Asia is tricky business. Often it isn't enough topossess a good product or offer the best price. There's alarge degree of influence peddling and political favoritism.   History is also important. Swedish-based Ericsson, forinstance, has been selling to China for almost 100 years.Ericsson is now one of the leading product suppliers for bothswitching and cellular-phone networks in China. SaysEricsson's Mr. Granstrom: &quot;If you aren't in {China} by now,you're out of luck.&quot;   For overseas groups that don't have the history, jointventures are the next best thing.   In Indonesia, for example, there was a well-publicizedbattle between Japanese and U.S. equipment companies tosupply 700,000 digital switching lines. The hotly contestedcompetition ended in a draw in November 1990 between anATandamp;T-led consortium and a separate NEC Corp. and SumitomoCorp. partnership. Then in January 1991, Perumtel, the statetelephone company, selected two local companies to work withthe two groups -- P.T. Citra Telekomunikasi Indonesia, withthe ATandamp;T consortium, and P.T. Elektrindo Nusantara, with theNEC-Sumitomo partnership. Both Indonesian companies arecontrolled by children of Indonesia's President Suharto.   Initially, Indonesia had planned to award only onecontract. In the end, Perumtel doubled the volume of work andgave each of the winners half the contract.   The country has only about 1.4 million telephone lines, orone for every 130 people. Cacuk Sudarijanto,president-director of Perumtel, said early this year thatseven million lines are needed just to meet current demand.   Here are other examples of project competition around theregion:                                                                                                          MALAYSIA                                                                                                          Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd., Malaysia's partiallyprivatized phone company, plans to invest M$5.35 billion(US$1.94 billion) through 1995 to improve its system.Industry analysts and diplomats say that competition is stifffor contracts to install switching and new digital exchangesto replace the outmoded exchanges. Telekom Malaysia hasearmarked expenditures of M$1 billion in this area through1995.   Among the competitors are ATandamp;T and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan.Fujitsu President Tadashi Sekizawa has said that the initialinvestment to build digital exchange systems would amount toM$40 million if the company won a contract to be TelekomMalaysia's sole provider of the exchange systems.                                                                                                          TAIWAN                                                                                                          This country also has big spending plans fortelecommunications, with projected outlays totaling US$7.39billion through 1996. The phone system, like much of thecountry's infrastructure, just barely meets users' needs:Only about 30% of its 20 million people are phonesubscribers.   Several projects already are in the bidding stage,including two tenders totaling US$300 million forcellular-phone and paging networks. Likely bidders for thecellular-phone project are ATandamp;T, Motorola Inc., NorthernTelecom Ltd. and Ericsson, which has the bulk of the currentcellular system.   It's unclear just how far the government is planning to goin allowing foreign companies to play a large role inservices. In the equipment sector, however, ATandamp;T, GeneralTelephone andamp; Electronics Ltd. and ITT Corp. provide asignificant amount of technology for Taiwan's existingtelecommunications system.                                                                                                          THAILAND                                                                                                          A contract to install three million phone lines inThailand at an estimated cost of US$3.4 billion was awardedlast year to CP Telecommunications Co., a unit of thepowerful agro-industrial Charoen Pokphand Group. But beforethe deal could be signed, the government of Prime MinisterChatichai Choonhavan was toppled amid claims of governmentcorruption. While no public allegations of favoritism wereleveled against the group, the prime minister's successor,Anand Panyarachun, nevertheless ordered a task force toreview the CP Telecom concession.   In April, World Bank advisers concluded that CP Telecom'sbid was higher than other bids. The World Bank panel alsoquestioned the length of the 25-year concession to build andoperate the new phone lines as potentially monopolistic. Inlate June, at the behest of certain high-ranking militaryofficials, the issue was resolved, preserving CP Telecom'slicense but trimming the size of the project from threemillion to two million new lines. ATandamp;T's Mr. Brandt says CPTelecom will begin requesting bids for equipment contracts byearly next year. &quot;We'll be a major bidder for that contractalong with everyone else.&quot;   If the project goes ahead as scheduled, the new lines willmore than triple the capital's current supply of 943,699, orabout one for every six people.   Mobile phones now provide an alternative to overcrowdedlines. Services are expensive, however, and friction betweenthe country's two state-owned telecommunications bodies --the Telephone Organization of Thailand and the CommunicationsAuthority of Thailand, which handles overseas links -- hascaused glitches in operations.                                                                                                          CHINA                                                                                                          As a whole, this country's infrastructural deficienciesare among the worst in Asia. However, in the coastal andsouthern provinces, telecommunications development is on apar with other countries in the region. These provinces,unlike areas in the north and west, have the foreign exchangeto buy the required equipment. They also have approval fromBeijing officials, who know that trade and technology linkswith Hong Kong and other foreign interests will help drivethe rest of the country forward.   China plans to run more than 1,500 miles of fiber-opticcable from Shanghai in the north to Guangdong in the south by1993. The government's most recent five-year plan calls for15 million switches and 150,000 phone lines to be installedthrougout China by 1995, although industry analysts suspectthat the commercially vibrant coastal provinces will receivemost of the new equipment.   Adjacent to Hong Kong, Guangzhou was the first province totake full advantage of a cellular-phone service to easecongestion on regular phones. Cellular networks have alsobeen proposed as a means of linking China's more remotepopulations to urban centers.   Still, the bulk of investment is slated for switches andcables. &quot;China invests heavily in infrastructure, and wedon't expect them to slow down any time soon,&quot; saysEricsson's Mr. Granstrom.                                                                                                          THE PHILIPPINES                                                                                                          This country's desperate need to improvetelecommunications seems to be on hold while the government'sliberalization efforts face resistance from the giantPhilippines Long Distance Telephone Co. The company has takenlegal action against the government for ordering it tointerconnect its services with would-be competitors.   PLDT controls 94% of the country's phone lines, 80% ofwhich are in metropolitan Manila, where there is onetelephone for every 10 people. In other cities, the averagedrops to one line for every 50 people, while in rural areasthe ratio is one for every thousand.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA                                                                                                          A protective government has served South Koreantelecommunications well, fostering the establishment of oneof the region's most extensive and sophisticated phonesystems -- and one that is most resistant to incursions fromforeign suppliers. The country boasts about 15 million phonelines for its 42 million people. An additional 2.2 millionlines are expected this year.   Most of this progress has been made in the past decade. Ithas come through extensive government fund-raising effortsand a hefty subscribers' deposit of US$330 per line, whichprovides a reliable pool of cash currently totaling aboutUS$4.4 billion. In 1980, South Korea had fewer than twomillion lines and a waiting time of six months to a year.   &quot;Considering where they started from, they have done thebest job of anyone in the past 10 years of building up basicservices,&quot; says David Johnson, vice president and managingdirector of ATandamp;T Far East (Korea) Ltd. in Seoul.   The Seoul government plans to ease protectionismgradually. Seoul officials say Korea will allow limitedcompetition in overseas calls this year, in domesticlongdistance calls in 1995, and in cellular-phone services in1993.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA                                                                                                          By contrast with South Korea, this country is relying lesson government financial support and more on private-sectoringenuity. The government announced a plan last year to allowa second nationwide telecommunications system to be built by1992 and compete with the state-owned telephone company. Thegovernment hopes competition will lower phone rates andimprove services now rife with rude operators and incorrectbilling. Two consortia -- both with strong U.S. corporateparticipation -- have been selected to bid for the contract,and a winner is expected to be announced by year's end.                                                                                                          JAPAN   Japan ended the state-owned telecommunications monopoly in1985, when the government declared Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone Corp., or NTT, a private company and allowedcompetition. Since then, Japanese consumers have been offereda staggering increase in options and that rarest of Japaneseexperiences, price cuts.   New competitors to NTT for domestic long-distance callsnow have as much as 40% of the market in heavily populatedareas, while two new challengers to Kokusai Denshin DenwaCo., the international long-distance company, have 10% of themarket, reducing rates by 50% and 25% respectively.   Despite the benefits of further deregulation, Japanesegovernment and business leaders still have mixed feelingsabout unfettered competition in a field considered strategic.While some groups advocate an ATandamp;T-style breakup of NTT, sucha decision has been put off until 1995, in part because ofconcern over losing a longtime central figure in Japan'shigh-tech industrial policy.                                                                                                          HONG KONG                                                                                                          Deregulation is also on the minds of Hong Kong governmentpolicy makers, who are discussing the introduction of asecond territorywide cable network. Last year, the governmentoffered a franchise license to one group, but fighting amongits members forced the HK$5.5 billion (US$709.8 million)project to fold.   Until government officials announce other plans, domesticand international phone franchises will remain firmly in thehands of the Hong Kong Telecom group, a subsidiary ofBritain's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC.   Beyond conventional services, three cellular-phoneoperators and 29 radio-pager companies operate in the Britishcolony, and later this year four additional vendors areexpected to introduce a new generation of mobile cordlessphones, or CT2s.   Competition in facsimile and electronic data services isalso emerging following a series of agreements earlier thisyear between Hong Kong, the U.S., Japan and Britain. Faxmessages currently account for close to half the callsleaving Hong Kong and represent approximately HK$1.5 billionin annual long-distance revenue, according to a Hong KongTelecom spokesman.   Hutchison-ATandamp;T Network Services, a joint venture betweenthe U.S. company and Hong Kong-based HutchisonTelecommunications Ltd., a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., isthe first to launch a competing international fax service,and others are expected to follow.   ---   Mr. Stine is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal'sHong Kong bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
