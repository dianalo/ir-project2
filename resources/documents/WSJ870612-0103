Over the past two decades, publishers have earned an A-plus for using technology to revolutionize production and distribution, cut costs and boost profit from newspapers, magazines and books.    More investment in these technologies is on the way: Times Mirror Corp., for instance, plans to spend $385 million to modernize production at the Los Angeles Times, and McGraw-Hill Inc. recently invested in an electronic book publishing system that will cut pre-printing costs as much as 40% and reduce the time it takes to bring a manuscript to print 30% to 50%.    But publishers' efforts to use technology to develop new products get a mixed grade. The industry rates a solid B in delivering a wide range of sophisticated data electronically to specialty markets such as big corporations and financial institutions. And as mass marketers of electronic information to individual consumers, publishers get an F, having pushed technological advances in areas where no demand existed.    Over the past few years, a half-dozen giant media companies have lost millions on ill-fated ventures aimed at selling electronic publishing products to a public hooked on print.    &quot;There just hasn't been any indication that most of the population is interested in receiving their information electronically rather than by newspaper or magazine,&quot; says Paul Kagan, whose media research firm, Kagan Associates, recently halted publication of a newsletter called Electronic Publishing after the market failed to develop as expected. &quot;People don't sit in their house reading data,&quot; says Mr. Kagan.    Some industry executives predict that in time, consumer demand for electronically delivered information will rise; the experiments, they say, were necessary. &quot;Consumer videotext was a hedge on the part of some newspapers, who felt they had to experiment because of the enormous stakes involved,&quot; says Joseph E. Kasputys, executive vice president of development at McGraw-Hill.    Electronic publishing has had far greater success in the business market. But profits have been elusive for all but the most powerful companies. James McGrane, director of government and industrial markets for Mead Corp.'s Mead Data Central, which provides legal and general data-retrieval services, calculates that electronic publishing has grown into a $5 billion-a-year business in the past 15 years. But he warns, &quot;The traditional publisher who thinks he can go electronic and make a quick dollar is in for a surprise as he enters the on-line jungle.&quot; He figures there are more than 2,900 data bases world-wide, &quot;and only a few make money.&quot;    The big electronic business publishers, such as McGraw-Hill, Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., focus primarily on finding faster and more lucrative ways to deliver information they already gather for their basic print markets. &quot;The key is linking information and action in real time,&quot; says William L. Dunn, a Dow Jones executive vice president who oversees the company's information services unit.    Mr. Kasputys of McGraw-Hill says the company believes electronic publishing markets will grow 15% to 20% annually, while print markets grow only 10% a year. Likely customers: executives who must arm themselves with the latest information on such things as stock prices; brokerage reports; corporate performance, and patents.    These publishers use a wide variety of electronic distribution means, including personal computers, compact disks that can store as much as 250,000 pages of information, and satellite broadcasting of data. For example, McGraw-Hill's oil industry newsletter, Platt's Oilgram, is starting to deliver oil news and pricing data to subscribers via computer time-sharing or by satellite signals that are transmitted over FM airwaves to personal computers.
