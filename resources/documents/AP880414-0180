(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Arizona political news has been dominatedrecently by the ouster of Republican Gov. Evan Mecham, butDemocrats will reclaim the spotlight, at least temporarily, withpresidential caucuses on Saturday.   The outcome is viewed as a tossup between Michael Dukakis, whohas lined up endorsements from key Democrats, and Jesse Jackson,whose firmly committed supporters may be more likely to turn out atthe caucuses.   ``I think we can win Arizona,'' Jackson coordinator John Norrissaid Thursday, ``because people committed to Jesse Jackson tend tobe more apt to go out and vote.''   Dukakis, meanwhile, has been gaining endorsements from the likesof Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, Tucson Mayor Tom Volgy, and anumber of state lawmakers and local government officials.   Dukakis campaign spokesman Jose Villarreal said the endorsementswere significant ``because these are all very well-known andrespected individuals.''   Arizona's caucuses begin the process of alloting 36 nationalconvention delegates _ a mere blip compared to the 255 at stake inNew York's primary on Tuesday. The caucuses resemble a primary inthat voters merely cast their ballots and leave. But there are only99 polling places statewide _ far fewer than the 1,932 regularvoting precincts _ which means Democrats must find out where tovote and travel farther. Voters will make two choices: apresidential preference and a delegate ballot.   ``Jackson is at a distinct advantage under this kind of asystem,'' Villarreal said, adding that Jackson won in Michigan,which has a similar voting process.   The only objective indicator of support is a survey severalweeks old that showed Dukakis as the choice of 36 percent, comparedto 17 percent for Jackson and 4 percent for Tennessee Sen. AlbertGore Jr. But the poll had a small sample and did not screen forlikely voters.   ``I think it's anybody's race at this point,'' said one Dukakissupporter, state Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens. ``I thinkArizonans are just now focusing on this primary. They've beenconsumed with the Mecham trial.''   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office on April 4 by theSenate impeachment court.   Jackson supporter Sen. Carolyn Walker predicted her candidatewill win, adding, ``I think the die-hard Jackson supporters aregoing to find their way out (to the polls). I kind of feel a littlebit in that Dukakis takes Arizona for granted.''   The new governor, Rose Mofford, is a Democrat, but has notendorsed any of the candidates. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, whodropped out of the 1988 race in February, appeared with Jackson ata rally last week but did not endorse him.   Jackson's campaign has done no advertising, while Villarrealsaid Dukakis has spent only about $1,500 on radio ads statewide.   Blacks make up less than 10 percent of Arizona's population. Thestate keeps no statistics on what percentage of Arizona's 1.58million registered voters are minorities.   State party executive director Glenn Davis said he expected only25,000 to 30,000 of the state's registered 683,000 Democrats tovote Saturday.   ``That's why I think Jackson can win here because he's wellorganized and his people will go vote,'' Davis said.   Only registered Democrats can vote but the party says it willhave registrars on hand to register new voters.</TEXT></DOC>
