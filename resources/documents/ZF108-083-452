 Any business with a data processing department isfamiliar with the difficulties involved in correcting software problems.andO;These difficulties are even more pronounced for software vendors.andP;  Inaddition to correcting identified problems, software vendors have the burdenof managing many occurrences of each particular problem.andP;  Researchs at CincomSystems have created HELDA, an expert system that addresses thesedifficulties.andP;  HELDA describes problems and retrieves solutions in complexsoftware.andM;PROBLEM DEFINITIONandM;Many computer hardware advances have been made in the last few years.andP;  Speedand capacity improvements enable software to help computer users.andP;  By handling more details, the software allows users to focus on the task at handrather than on how the computer operates.andP;  Behind the facade of the fast andfriendly user interface, however, looms a growing problem.andP;  The computerprograms comprising this facilitative software are getting larger and morecomplex.andP;  Hardware speed ensures fast response time for users, but it doesnothing to ensure that the additional computer instructions executed arecorrect.andM;Just as new technology enhanced user productivity, so must the softwareindustry seek new approaches to enhance customer support.andP;  As products aredeveloped, new support techniques are required just to maintain response timeand support quality.andP;  Competitive pressures further complicate the situation.andO;Support quality must not be compromised and should be improved--but supportcosts also must not increase.andM;One of the most perplexing difficulties facing software vendors is how todescribe user problems and locate assistance to address them.andP;  Thetraditional method is to distill the user's description into a few key words,which are then associated with the problem and provide the basis for itsretrieval.andP;  Performing this process on every problem creates a repository ofpotentially similar problems.andP;  For each new problem, the repository issearched for problems with similar key words.andP;  In this manner, previousproblem resolutions are used to solve later occurrences of the same problem.andM;The shortcoming of this approach lies in the selection, form, and content ofthe key words.andP;  The choice and composition of the key words are entirelyarbitrary.andP;  The search results depend on the skill with which both thedescription and search processes are done.andP;  But since each process isinvariably performed by a different person, the success of the overalloperation is beyond any individual's control.andP;  No matter how well the searchis conducted, a poor problem description can thward the search effort andvice versa.andP;  Then the search process becomes an exercise in frustration inwhich the search time and the quality of the results can vary dramatically.andO;This process is very inefficient, since the time and resources needed tosolve a problem represent a significant investment by the software vendor.andM;APPLICATION DESCRIPTIONandM;Cincom Systems created HELDa to resolve the shortcomings of the traditionalapproach to software support.andP;  HELDA is embedded within Cincom Systems'product support system; it is written in ADS, an expert system shell, and theproduct support system is written in MANTIS, a fourth-generation language.andO;Interfaces between the two systems are written in assembler language.andP;  Boththe expert system and product support system use SUPRA, a relationaldatabase, for data storage and retrieval.andP;  The product support system is usedat Cincom offices worldwide through an IBM mainframe-based terminal network.andM;HELDA comprises 32 knowledge bases containing 3,500 rules.andP;  HELDA has twoexpert systems, Automated Characterization Expert (ACE) and Similarity andDiscrepancy Analyzing Retrieval system (SADAR).andM;ACE automates problem description by guiding the user through a series ofquestions that establish what the user was trying to do with the product andwhy the outcome was unsatisfactory.andP;  ACE builds a problem description basedon the user's responses and encodes the description.andP;  The problem repositoryis indexed on these ACE codes.andM;SADAR completely automates the search process without interacting with theuser.andP;  SADAR builds its search key by analyzing the problem repository'sindex.andP;  When the analysis is complete, SADAR retrieves the ACE codes andperforms a discrepancy analysis between those that describe the new problemand those from the problem repository.andP;  For each ACE code from the problemrepository, SADAR determines a confidence level reflecting the degree ofsimilarity between the two problems.andP;  The repository problems with thehighest confidence level are presented to the user with a graphic depictionof how each compared with the new problem.andP;  The user can then browse theresolutions associated with the repository problems.andM;HELDA can support problem records (textual accounts of problem occurrences),problem resolutions (remedies for error conditions), and diagnostic methods(procedures for deternining resolutions).andP;  Problem records are the only typeof assistance in production at this time, but problem resolutions anddiagnostic methods are scheduled to be implemented in 1989.andM;HELDA incorporates several innovations.andP;  The most significant is the fullyautomated search process.andP;  By imposing a framework for key values, HELDA canuse a structured search that yields both definitive results and a qualitativeassessment of the results.andP;  The encoded keys HELDA uses achieve twoadditional innovations.andP;  Since the search and analysis use only the encodedform of description, the system operation is independent of the user'slanguage.andP;  A problem described in French would be properly compared withothers described in English, German, or Italian.andP;  In addition, the key'sencoding minimizes storage requirements while its structured form optimizessearch efficiency.andP;  Finally, the structured form of the search key allows theproblem description process to be generalized.andP;  The result is an applicationshell for describing problems.andP;  Twenty-five knowledge bases were built simplyby adding product knowledge to a copy of this application shell.andM;DEPLOYMENT CRITERIAandM;The system requirements were that the system be usable by a high schoolgraduate with a superficial understanding of data processing.andP;  The usabilityrequirements were somewhat more numerous: the system operation had to beindependent of the user language, and describing a problem had to beindependent of retrieving associated assistance.andP;  User responses and dataentry were to be minimized, and a response of &quot;unknown&quot; would always beacceptable.andP;  In addition, the user had to be able to suspend and resume theconsultation at any time, change responses seconds or days later, and be freeto disagree with the response selection and &quot;suggest&quot; new responses.andP;  Last,searching with any number or combination of &quot;unkown&quot; or &quot;suggested&quot; responseshad to be valid.andM;Response time requirements were specified for each exchange of theconsultation and the entire consultation: 10 seconds for &quot;describe,&quot; oneminute for &quot;retrieve,&quot; and five minutes total elapsed time.andP;  The deploymentrequirements specified initial deployment on an IBM mainframe, but the systemhad to be capable of PC deployment and distributed deployment between amainframe and any number of PCs.andM;The primary resource consumption requirement was that the system not affectother mainframe systems.andP;  The runtime costs had to be comparable to thecurrent system, and productivity gains had to justify the development anddeployment costs.andM;ORGANIZATION PAYOFFandM;HELDA's most important payoff to the corporation was to cut the costs ofproviding support.andP;  Cost savings for the first full year are estimated at$1.5 million.andP;  Another important payoff is in customer response time.andP;  Thesystem gives the customer at least a preliminary assessment of the situationwithin five minutes.andP;  If places in the customer's hands (underconsideration), the system will reduce the product-support call load,eliminate the logging of redundant problems, and automate entry for newproblems.andM;HELDA also increases the efficiency of product support personnel byautomating the assistance search and providing definitive results.andP;  Thesystem also captures and distributes expertise worldwide on a realtime basisand eases the burden of new hires by providing a standardized approach toproblems, minimizing data entry, and unifying assistance sources.andP;  Finally,the system eliminates rework on existing problems and the time wasted insearching for assistance.andM;HELDA was placed in production in St. Louis on Oct. 1, 1988.andP;  Deploymentfollowed in Cincinnati on Nov. 1, South America on Dec. 1, and the remainderof North America on Jan. 15, 1989.andP;  Europe and Asia/Pacific were scheduledfor summer 1989.andM;The system is deployed on an IBM 3084 mainframe under the time-sharing optionof the IBM's MVS/XA operating system.andP;  HELDA uses the high performance optionversion of Aion's Application Development System for MVS (ADS/MVS).andP;  Thenetwork of IBM model 3270 terminals are managed by IBM's VirtualTelecommunication Access Method.andP;  The search results presentation uses CincomSystem's fourth-generation language MANTIS.andP;  Data storage and retrieval isprimarily accomplished through Cincom System's relational database, SUPRA,but a portion is managed by IBM's Virtual Storage Access Method.andM;Development costs include expenditures for hardware, software, and personnel.andO;The hardware expenditures were for two Compaq Deskpro model 386 PCs with 10MBof RAM.andP;  The software required were two copies of MicroSoft's MS/DOS andADS/OS2 operating systems, two copies of Aion's ADS/PC and ADS/OS2 expertsystem shells, one copy of Aion's ADS/MVS and HPO products, one copy of IBM'sMVS Pascal compiler, and one copy of NSA's Adapt/RJE networking product.andO;Personnel costs include four person-years on the PCs for developing theexpert system and one person-year on the mainframe for interfacing the expertsystem to the product support system.andP;  The transfer to field took threemonths for North and South America.andP;  Europe and Asia/Pacific are alsoexpected to require three months.andM;DEDICATION MEANS RESULTSandM;HELDA succeeded due to a near religious adherence to the problem statementand solution criteria established at the project's onset.andP;  Commitment byupper management was vital, since success required acquiring much hardwareand software.andP;  Sufficient time was allowed to design and develop the systemproperly.andP;  Finally, by using existing technology where possible rather thanexploring the outer limits, deployment was possible within the existingproduct support system.andM;The prognosis for future similar projects is excellent for menu-drivenproducts since an application shell has already been developed.andP;  Because theyare highly structured, embedded products are also expected to be foodcandidates for this type of approach.andP;  While user query products arerelatively unstructured, their similarity with executing program statementswithin menu-driven products indicates that they, too, can be conquered.andM;Anthony R.
