RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MER NYNTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teleport Communications, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s telecommunications unit, asked federal regulators to rule on whether New York Telephone Co. must allow Teleport to install certain phone gear in the telephone company's central office.    The equipment would allow Teleport to compete with New York Telephone, a unit of Nynex Corp., in the business of relaying long-distance calls from the central office to long-distance carriers. Teleport estimates that long-distance companies now pay New York Telephone about $340 million a year for providing such relays. Teleport says that in the unlikely event that it captured all of the business, it could save the long-distance companies $170 million.    A spokesman for New York Telephone said it is willing to provide a connection for Teleport but not by placing Teleport's equipment in the telephone company's central office. Granting the request to locate the Teleport gear with its own switching equipment, known in the industry as co-location, would invite a flood of such requests from other telecommunications concerns, the spokesman said. The phone company would then lose control over its space and security, the spokesman said.    Co-location has been a subject of dispute between alternative providers of telecommunications services such as Teleport and the local telephone companies.    Teleport's proposal would &quot;constitute competition,&quot; said Robert C. Atkinson, Teleport's vice president for regulatory and external affairs. &quot;They just don't want competition,&quot; he said of Nynex.    Teleport is 97%-owned by Merrill Lynch and owns a 150-mile fiber-optic link between New York City and northern New Jersey.    Teleport said that about a year ago it asked New York Telephone to allow it to place the equipment in the central office. There Teleport's gear would pick up outgoing long-distance phone calls that come into New York Telephone's switches from local telephone users. The equipment would then process and route calls made by Teleport's customers directly to the long distance carriers for transmission.    New York Telephone would continue to provide the first leg of long-distance phone calls-that is, from the customer to its central office switches. In most instances now, New York Telephone also provides the link from its own switches to the long-distance carrier.    Under federal communications laws, local telephone companies are required to provide the interconnections between other telecommunications concerns like Teleport and long-distance carriers, said Teleport's Mr. Atkinson. But at issue in this case, however, is whether the interconnection must be provided in New York Telephone's central office. &quot;There is no way we can offer the users any kind of cost savings or quality improvements without being able to have the equipment&quot; in the central office, said Mr. Atkinson.    In a petition, Teleport asked the Federal Communications Commission to help settle the co-location dispute. A ruling by the commission on the application of federal communications law to the issue could be a basis for future litigation.    A senior FCC official said the commission generally hasn't ordered phone companies to locate equipment in their central offices. &quot;We don't think it is a bad idea, but we have expressly declined to order it,&quot; he said.    The FCC's only concern, he said, is that interconnections permit fair competition between the Bell phone companies and others. </TEXT></DOC>
