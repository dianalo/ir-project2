Some environmentalists said the accident left a 10-mile oil slickand that wildlife was already dying. Others said it was too early tosay how much oil spilled and how much damage was done to the regionand its animals.   ``There could be a small stain'' from the release of oil in theengine room of the Bahia Paraiso, a navy spokesman said. ``Anythingelse, no.''   The vessel, which carried tourists as well as fuel for severalpolar stations, hit a rock Saturday, was evacuated and listed forthree days before sinking in high winds and heavy seas late Tuesdaynight. No one was injured.   The incident occurred in the Bismarck Strait 600 miles south ofCape Horn on the tip of South America and within two miles of theU.S. Palmer Research Station, where the ship's 300 tourists and crewinitially were taken.   The U.S. National Science Foundation said the vessel carried250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an ``incurable disaster''would result if all the fuel leaked into the unspoiled waters in theregion.   A spokesman at the research station who requested anonymity saidin a telephone interview that leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick.   Officials at the foundation, the U.S. base and Greenpeace saidleaking fuel already has killed some krill, a shrimp-like crustaceanthat is the main food of the baleen whale and a vital part of theAntarctic food chain.   ``The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully belowthe water,'' Peter Wilkniss, director of the foundation's Antarcticprogram, told ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday.   ``This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by aglacier and some islands and our (research) station. So if the oilgoes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, onthe ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he toldABC.   The depth of the water was not known.   Neverthess, it remained unclear Wednesday how much oil hadspilled, and the extent of any ecological damage.   ``The situation is totally controlled and there is no danger ofany type of release of fuel,'' said the navy spokesman, who demandedanonymity.   On Tuesday, the government news agency Telam said the fuel theship carried was contained in individual steel drums. The newsagency quoted a navy source as saying ``a spill is practicallyimpossible.''   Andrea Figari, the Antarctic expert in Buenos Aires for theenvironmental organization Greenpeace, said Wednesday: ``We needtime to confirm whether any oil spilled. News reports said krillwere killed. I'm not sure of that. It looks like the ship sank inthe bay and krill live in the open sea. There wouldn't have been alot of krill there.''   Asked to comment, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Airessaid, ``We're concerned about the potential of an oil spill, but tothe best of our knowlege so far there isn't one.'' Reports the BahiaParaiso carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel appear to be a``drastic exaggeration,'' he said.   The Bahia Paraiso, launched in 1980, is a navy vessel that forthree years has chartered excurision voyages as a way to defrayexpenses.</TEXT></DOC>
