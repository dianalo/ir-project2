And while the government seems to be trying to dissipate it quickly, the accumulated anger of years under repressive rule is defying easy appeasement.    In the five days since President Chun Doo Hwan's historic pledge to enact sweeping democratic reforms, some of the euphoria that greeted it already has turned to suspicion and impatience to have pent-up grievances resolved swiftly. Violent demonstrations have resumed by groups unsympathetic to the government's pleas for time to cut the red tape involved in changing the political system.    The political opposition, especially the Reunification Democracy Party, wants prompt movement to rewrite the Korean constitution and to specify that the next presidential election will be a direct, popular vote. Students, teachers, dissidents and labor leaders who were expelled, fired or jailed for their activism want immediate freedom or reinstatement.    The people of Kwangju want a full accounting of the military action that put down a 1980 civil insurrection in that city and left at least 191 -- some say as many as 3,500 -- dead. Saturday night, several hundred people in Kwangju clashed with police, who fired tear gas to prevent them from holding a rally for a democratic constitution.    Mr. Chun's government and the ruling Democratic Justice Party are by and large moving with uncharacteristic haste and apparent resolve to satisfy most of the demands and to head off others. Even before Mr. Chun agreed to major concessions to the political opposition and other anti-government forces, the cabinet had begun planning how to carry out the reforms. The ruling party has formed 11 task forces to develop plans for implementing various parts of the reforms.    Government bureaucrats have worked into the night to process papers for the release of political prisoners. Democratic Justice Party spokesman Kim Jung Nam said the party also is considering ways to &quot;heal scars&quot; of the Kwangju incident, including compensating relatives of those killed, a monument to the victims and an apology from the government.    Courts have released some of the estimated 400 people on trial in political cases by granting suspended sentences and dismissing charges. Justice Ministry officials said they would release 1,100 political prisoners, and only those convicted of treason or other serious charges will have to serve their sentences.    All ruling party and government officials are visibly striving to convince skeptics that they are sincere in their pledge to democratize one of the most politically restrained societies in the noncommunist world. But everyone -- from student activists who led the fight in the streets to those in the ruling circle who resisted -- agrees that the reforms won't be easy.    &quot;The easy part is over,&quot; says a political science professor from Seoul National University and one of the government's sharpest critics. &quot;Now comes the problem of delivering on the promises.&quot; His cynicism is underscored by the fact that he still doesn't feel safe to publicly criticize the government.    Last Monday, within hours of the surprise endorsement of the reforms by Roh Tae Woo, President Chun's handpicked successor and ruling-party chairman, several groups already were demanding immediate relief. Hundreds of students at Seoul National University demanded that a constitution be drawn up immediately providing for &quot;the return of military operational and commanding rights of our armed forces from the U.S.&quot; and ensuring freedom of the press and citizens' rights to assemble, demonstrate and strike.    The Council for Reinvigoration of the Press called for abolition of laws that control the media and which require that all Korean journalists be licensed.    On Wednesday, Mr. Chun was barely finished speaking when at least a dozen groups were calling for their complaints to be handled first, while others were calling for greater concessions. By the end of the week, students and opposition leaders were challenging the government's sincerity and insisting on speedier action, while a spate of labor strikes and demonstrations were under way.    Opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam threatened Saturday to shelve negotiations with the government and to call for a resumption of anti-government demonstrations unless political prisoners are freed. The opposition estimates the number of political prisoners at about 3,000; the government acknowledges 1,100.    Also on Saturday, dozens of women relatives of political prisoners marched to ruling-party headquarters to demand the immediate release of detainees. Scuffles broke out when plainclothes police moved in to break up the protests. About 50 women were taken away in police buses.    The hostility was aggravated by the death Sunday of a Yonsei student injured by fragments from a police tear-gas canister in a demonstration nearly a month ago. The death of 20-year-old Lee Han Yul, who had been kept alive on a respirator, sparked violent clashes with some 5,000 riot police Sunday.    Anti-government feeling also has been fanned by the relatively light sentences given to five policemen convicted Saturday of complicity in the torture death of another student last January. Family members and other spectators shouted insults and hurled chairs at the judge and the defendants over the judge's decision to sentence the policemen to prison terms ranging from five to 15 years.    The demonstrations of public impatience led Dong-A Ilbo, the nation's leading newspaper, to caution that &quot;the ruling camp's great offensive of democratization has just begun.&quot;    Adds a Western economist who specializes in political risk analysis: &quot;These guys have raised expectations dangerously high. If they drag their feet now, if they don't deliver and deliver fast, the lid's going to blow off this place in a way that'll make the French Revolution look like a wedding reception.&quot;    The analyst also warns that if the demands come too fast and furiously for hard-liners to digest, &quot;the military will be waiting in the wings to put a mean stop to an embryonic democracy.&quot;    He notes that the military has reacted that way twice before in South Korea's 39 years as an independent nation, after a brief experiment with democracy that followed the 1960 student revolution that toppled President Syngman Rhee, and in 1980 after the assassination of President Park Chung Hee. &quot;In both cases,&quot; he says, &quot;the generals let it go on only so long. Then they rolled in with the tanks.&quot;    Few political observers believe it's likely to happen that way again. &quot;The Olympics, only 15 months away, the U.S. government threatening sanctions if the military steps in, and the intolerance level of Koreans today make that highly unlikely,&quot; says an American scholar here. &quot;But that's not to say it's impossible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
