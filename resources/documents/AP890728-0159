(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A research lab where a techniciandied of a rare virus contracted from a monkey was cited and finedFriday for unsafe working conditions and failure to tell employeesabout the job risks.   International Research and Development Corp. of Mattawan wasfined $30,600 for six violations, ``five for willful violations andone for a serious violation,'' of the Michigan Occupational Safetyand Health Administration rules, the Department of Public Healthsaid.   The investigation followed the June 20 death of Thomas McGeorge,23, who was infected with the herpes B virus after being scratchedor bitten by a rhesus monkey, a species commonly used in labexperiments.   The violations include failure to record and medically monitor77 employee monkey bites and scratches during the two months beforeMcGeorge's death.   Other violations include failure to properly train employees inthe hazards and health risks of their jobs and failure to performfollow-ups on injured employees, according to the report, signed byMichael S. Mosher, district supervisor of the state OSHA.   Questionnaires given to employees by the agency found that of 71employees who had direct contact with the monkeys, 29 said they hadnever heard of the B virus before McGeorge's death.   Guidelines drawn up two years ago by the federal Center forDisease Control say that all employees handling such potentiallyinfected monkeys should be told of the risks.   Beside McGeorge, another former laboratory employee also isinfected with the virus. The 21-year-old man, whose name has notbeen released, was discharged from Bronson Methodist Hospital inKalamazoo last week following three weeks of treatment, hospitalofficials said.   IRDC ``emphatically denies the cruel and untrue `allegations'outlined in the MiOSHA report,'' company spokesman James Webb saidin a statement. ``No employee of IRDC has ever been willfullyinjured nor has the company ever violated any laws.''   Webb said the company plans to appeal the report's findings.   The report said IRDC's records show tests conducted on theapproximately 190 rhesus monkeys from China before the experimentbegan found that about 40 percent of them carried the virus.   The virus is commonly found in rhesus monkeys and is harmless tothe animals. But it has an estimated 70 percent mortality rateamong humans once symptoms appear.   The company has said the two infected employees never reportedany bites or scratches; but the report found that no illness orinjury log was kept, as recommended by the CDC.   The company, also under investigation by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture, employs about 350 people, uses thousands of animals,including monkeys, dogs, rabbits and rats, to test drugs andchemicals for pharmaceutical companies.   Blood tests on about 140 current and former IRDC employees havenot turned up any other cases of the virus, which attacks the brainand central nervous system. Twelve inconclusive tests are beingredone, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
