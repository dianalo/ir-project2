According to the      invention, an optically transmissive display faceplate is disclosed having      a substantially planar optically transmissive base sheet or a      substantially optically transmissive region of substantially uniform      thickness of a cathode ray tube envelope. On the base sheet is disposed at      least one layer of substantially optically transmissive solid material,      such as a deposited diamond film, with thermal conductivity greater than      that of the faceplate material disposed on at least a part of a major      surface of the substantially optically transmissive base sheet or      substantially optically transmissive region of substantially uniform      thickness of a cathode ray tube envelope. The base sheet also includes at      least a layer of cathodoluminescent material, which cathodoluminescent      material may be preferentially disposed on at least a part of a second      major surface of the faceplate or, alternatively, on at least a part of      the at least one layer of substantially optically transmissive solid      material. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  TECHNICAL FIELD </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to cathodoluminescent display devices and      more particularly to cathodoluminescent display devices employing      thermally conductive solid materials as a cooling mechanism and methods      for realizing such devices. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Cathodoluminescent image displays are known in the art. In these displays      high energy electrons are directed at a cathodoluminescent material      (phosphor) wherein some of the energy of the electrons is converted to      photon energy some of which is emitted from the display. The energy      conversion process is inefficient resulting in 80% or more of the energy      of the impinging electrons being converted to heat energy in the phosphor. </PAR><PAR>  The brightness, or luminous output, of a display is, in addition to other      parameters, generally proportional to the density of electrons incident at      the phosphor. That is, luminous output increases as current density      increases. Many display applications require high brightness which      correspondingly demands increased current density to the phosphor. The      required high current density will also result in high heat energy density      in the phosphor and immediate material on which the phosphor resides.      Since the phosphor and faceplate materials are effective insulators they      serve as relatively poor conductors of thermal energy. Unacceptably high      temperatures may result which can severely degrade device performance due      to thermal quenching of the phosphor material or physical damage to the      device structure caused by stress induced failure. Further, since displays      typically, are not uniformly illuminated, local hot spots due to high      brightness local regions of illumination, may result. </PAR><PAR>  One method of the prior art to reduce the temperature at the phosphor and      photon emission region of the cathodoluminescent display is through the      use of cooling fans to rapidly remove heat from the display. Cooling fans      are unsuitable in some applications due to size, power, noise, and cooling      capacity constraints. </PAR><PAR>  A second method of the prior art to reduce the temperature at the phosphor      and photon emission region of the cathodoluminescent display is through      the use of convection cooling techniques and is depicted in FIG. 1. In      this method a volume of liquid is disposed in contact with the display at      the area of high thermal energy flux. Convection flow is utilized to carry      the unwanted heat away from the display structure. The liquid medium must      be held in a containment vessel and the containment vessel must be sealed      and rigidly held in position with respect to the display surface. This      cooling method may introduce unacceptable distortions to the image, which      must traverse the extent of the cooling medium, because of the motion of      the medium. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, a need exists to provide a method and/or a display apparatus to      overcome at least some of these shortcomings of the prior art. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Pursuant to the invention disclosed herein at least some of these      shortcomings, and others, are overcome. An optically transmissive display      faceplate is disclosed wherein the faceplate may be a substantially planar      optically transmissive base sheet or a substantially optically      transmissive region of substantially uniform thickness of a cathode ray      tube envelope on which resides at least one layer of substantially      optically transmissive solid material, such as a deposited diamond film,      with thermal conductivity greater than that of the faceplate material      disposed on at least a part of a major surface of the substantially      optically transmissive base sheet or substantially optically transmissive      region of substantially uniform thickness of a cathode ray tube envelope,      and also including at least a layer of cathodoluminescent material, which      cathodoluminescent material may be preferentially disposed on at least a      part of a second major surface of the faceplate or, alternatively, on at      least a part of the at least one layer of substantially optically      transmissive solid material. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a partial side elevational cross-sectional view of a prior art      display device employing a liquid convection cooling medium. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2A is a partial side elevational cross-sectional view of a first      embodiment of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2B is a partial side elevational cross-sectional view of a second      embodiment of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a thermal profile depiction of a quartz faceplate with no cooling      mechanism. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a thermal profile depiction of a quartz faceplate employing      convection cooling techniques of the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a thermal profile depiction of a quartz faceplate employing the      methods of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  PREFERRED MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2A a partial side elevational cross-sectional      depiction of a first embodiment of the invention is shown wherein a      faceplate is comprised of a base sheet (101) having deposited on a first      major surface a cathodoluminescent material (103) which cathodoluminescent      material (103) will emit photons corresponding to energy associated with a      preferred portion of the electromagnetic spectrum when energized by      incident high energy electrons. A layer of substantially optically      transmissive solid material (102), such as a diamond film, is deposited on      at least a part of a second major surface of the base sheet (101). The      substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) exhibits thermal      characteristics, such as thermal conductivity, which are an improvement      over the thermal characteristics of the base sheet (101) and      cathodoluminescent material (103). </PAR><PAR>  By disposing the substantially optically transmissive solid material (102)      directly onto a surface of the base sheet (101), at least a portion of the      thermal energy which has been imparted to the base sheet (101) and the      cathodoluminescent material (103) as a result of the inefficient      electron-to-photon conversion process will be conducted to the      substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) and further      conducted to a suitable dissipative element such as, for example, a      radiating fin. </PAR><PAR>  The faceplate may be a portion of an envelope of a cathode ray tube which      portion exhibits a substantially optically transmissive characteristic and      further exhibiting substantially uniform thickness. </PAR><PAR>  The substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) may be      deposited by any of many known methods such as, for example, thermally      induced precipitative surface crystallization. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2B a partial side elevational cross-sectional view of      a second embodiment of the invention is shown wherein a faceplate as      described above with reference to FIG. 2A is provided. A layer of      substantially optically transmissive solid material (102), such as a      diamond film, is deposited on at least a part of a major surface of the      base sheet (101). Subsequently, a layer of cathodoluminescent material      (103) is deposited on at least a part of the layer of substantially      optically transmissive solid material (102), which cathodoluminescent      material (103) will emit photons corresponding to energy associated with a      preferred portion of the electromagnetic spectrum when energized by      incident high energy electrons. The substantially optically transmissive      solid material (102) exhibits thermal characteristics, such as thermal      conductivity, which are an improvement over the thermal characteristics of      the base sheet (101) and cathodoluminescent material (103). </PAR><PAR>  By disposing the substantially optically transmissive solid material (102)      directly onto a surface of the base sheet (101), at least a portion of the      thermal energy which has been imparted to the base sheet (101) and the      cathodoluminescent material (103) as a result of the inefficient      electron-to-photon conversion process will be conducted to the      substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) and further      conducted to a suitable dissipative element such as, for example, a      radiating fin. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2B the thermally      conducting substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) is an      intervening layer between the base sheet (101) and the cathodoluminescent      material (103) and as such is disposed proximally with respect to the      source of thermal energy which is generated in the cathodoluminescent      material (103). </PAR><PAR>  The faceplate may be a portion of an envelope of a cathode ray tube which      portion exhibits a substantially optically transmissive characteristic and      further exhibiting substantially uniform thickness. </PAR><PAR>  The substantially optically transmissive solid material (102) may be      deposited by any of many known methods such as, for example, thermally      induced precipitative surface crystallization. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 3 a thermal profile of a partial cross-section of a      faceplate comprised of fused quartz material is shown. The depiction      clearly demonstrates the temperature rise and thermal gradients existing      within the faceplate structure as a result of incident thermal flux of 10      Watts per square inch. </PAR><PAR>  The numerals in FIG. 3 depict the temperature ranges represented by each      corresponding shaded area. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 4 a thermal profile of a partial cross-section of a      faceplate comprised of fused quartz material with a volume of      ethyleneglycol convective coolant and radiative fins is shown. The      depiction clearly demonstrates the temperature rise and thermal gradients      existing within the faceplate structure and coolant as a result of      incident thermal flux of 10 Watts per square inch. The numerals in FIG. 4      depict the temperature ranges represented by each corresponding shaded      area. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 5 a thermal profile of a partial cross-section of a      faceplate comprised of fused quartz material with a layer of substantially      optically transmissive diamond film is shown. The depiction clearly      demonstrates the temperature rise and thermal gradients existing within      the faceplate structure and diamond film as a result of incident thermal      flux of 10 Watts per square inch.
