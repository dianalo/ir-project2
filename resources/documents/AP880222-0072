Because the people who produce and deal in cocaine, marijuanaand heroin are so wealthy, the law enforcement agencies entrustedwith the fight against them are often outmatched.   Indeed, Bolivian President Victor Paz Estenssoro estimatescocaine brings in $600 million each year to his nation, compared to$500 million for all legal exports combined.   In that impoverished South American country alone, about 400,000farmers, merchants and others depend directly or indirectly on cocaleaf farming and cocaine for their livelihood.   Allegations that the drug trade is providing funds forcandidates has become an issue in this year's election inVenezuela. An outburst of drug-related violence in Colombia has ledto calls for the government to be given special powers to combat it.   Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico have for some time been known asnotorious centers of drug production and trafficking.   But in recent months, cases and allegations of officials playingan integral role in the drug trade have emerged in once overlookedcountries _ Honduras, Haiti and Panama.   And after a period of relative calm, drug cases proceeding inthe U.S. judicial system are once again having a major impact onrelations between Washington and many Latin American nations.   ``Unfortunately, much the United States does these days becomesburied in ideological rhetoric which has nothing whatever to dowith the issue at hand,'' said a recent editorial in the DailyNation, the largest newspaper in the Caribbean island nation ofBarbados.   Traditionally, the response from governments and observers inthe region is to call for the United States to look more closely athow to control American drug consumers, whose dollars provide thebasic incentive for the trade.   In a recent editorial, the Mexican government news agencyNotimex said the money floated in the drug trade approximates thetotal amount of debt service payments made by Latin Americancountries each year _ something in the neighborhood of $47 billion.   ``That figure shows the economic magnitude that the networks ofnarcotics trafficking have, and the use of planes, ships, weaponsand a great deal of money to bribe officials and judicialauthorities,'' the editorial said. ``However, the principal problemis the enormous consumption of drugs that exists in the UnitedStates, and that reaches $110 billion.''   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces ofPanama and the power behind his country's nominally civiliangovernment, was named in two Florida indictments Feb. 5 forracketeering and other drug-related charges.   Allegations of his involvement in a wide range of illicitactivities, including drug trafficking and money laundering, haveplayed a role in protests against his rule that began in June.   In retaliation for the steady attacks from Washington, Noriega'ssupporters have called for the ouster of the Southern Command,headquarters for all U.S. military activities in Latin America.   The Pentagon, meanwhile, has described as ``isolated cases'' therecent discovery of two cocaine shipments aboard U.S. militaryaircraft based in Panama, saying they did not appear linked toofficial corruption in that country.   In Honduras, a key U.S. ally in Central America, the governmentand armed forces have responded with indignation to newspaperaccounts alleging links between the military and drug traffickers.   ``I am free of any guilt,'' Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez,chief of the Honduran armed forces, said in a telephone interview.``I will not deceive my own people.''   Haitian Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who runs an army unit known ashis country's most brutal, was named by a Miami businessman asHaiti's main cocaine trafficker. The businessman, Osvaldo Quintana,told reporters he also knew of involvement by higher Haitianofficials.   Testimony at the trial of reputed Colombian drug kingpin CarlosLehder Rivas in Jacksonville, Fla., has implicated Prime MinisterLynden O. Pindling of the Bahamas.   Nine Mexicans were indicted in January in Los Angeles in the1985 kidnap-murder of American drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar,while a San Diego case a week later named seven Mexicans among 12foreign nationals said to be behind a major cocaine ring.   ``We insist that it will not be possible to defeat internationaldrug trafficking unless production, distribution and consumptionare attacked with similar strength and effectiveness,'' PresidentMiguel de la Madrid said at his Feb. 13 meeting with PresidentReagan. ``This final link (consumption in the United States)continues to have a determining influence in the criminal chain.''   ``It looks like (U.S. officials) are taking the problemseriously but they're not,'' Bayardo Ramirez Monagas, president ofVenezuela's National Commission on Drug Abuse, said in aninterview. ``The problem is not production or consumption, but thefinancing.''</TEXT></DOC>
