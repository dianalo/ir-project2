<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0560 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new type of nonpropagating surface-wave-like magnon has been detectedin yttrium iron garnet films (YIG) in a magnetostatic wave (MSW) devicestructure using Brillouin light scattering. The measurements were carriedout on a YIG film stripline device operated at 2--4 GHz. With an appliedmagnetic field parallel to the stripline, magnon signals were observedat fields above the surface wave band edge. Theory shows that highlylocalized, evanescent surface modes can exist at such fields, but onlywhen a ground plane is present; the bandwidth in field or frequency isinversely proportional to the separation between the film and the groundplane. The observed evanescent wave band limits are in good agreementwith the theoretical values.</TEXT></DOC>
