In a report scheduled to be released today, a special task force of the Securities and Exchange Council of the Finance Ministry calls for clearer definitions of who is an insider and what constitutes inside information. The 11-member committee of legal scholars also recommends that violators be subject to criminal penalties.    Although insider trading is illegal under current law, many Japanese don't see anything wrong with making money on a hot rumor or confidential information. &quot;Most Japanese had a hard time understanding why America was so strict with Ivan Boesky,&quot; says one brokerage official who asked not to be identified.    Investors here thrive on good stories about stocks, whether they are true or not. Brokers create investment themes around them and soon a market rally is born. It is not unusual, for example, for investors to swap stories on hot stocks gleaned from brokers, newspapers, or talk around Kabutocho, Tokyo's Wall Street. One group of big-time investors meets once a week to compose a list of 10 hot stocks, which each investor then passes on to friends or family. One investor estimates that by the end of day, the 15 or so original copies of the list of market rumors have multiplied to 10,000 copies.    &quot;Some of the information may be privileged but we don't know for sure. We hear it as a rumor,&quot; says the investor. &quot;Where do you draw the line between a rumor and inside information?&quot;    Until recently, even Finance Ministry officials were reluctant to admit that insider trading existed in Japan. They were able to resist pressure from the U.S. and the United Kingdom to toughen their stance on securities violations until a suspicious case turned up in September. In that case, one of Tateho Chemical Industries Co.'s banks admitted selling 337,000 Tateho shares shortly before the company announced big losses on bond futures. The bank denied this amounted to insider trading, and an official investigation said there wasn't conclusive evidence of violations.    The incident sparked awareness of the loopholes in the existing securities laws, and Finance Ministry officials admitted that the regulations were insufficient. The stock market crash last October, which demonstrated the close links between equity markets in Tokyo, New York and London, reinforced the need for changes.    &quot;The markets are becoming so international. It's only natural that insider trading is no longer just America's problem or Japan's problem. We have to look at it from an international perspective,&quot; says Hiroshi Kurihara, a managing director of the Japan Securities Dealers Association.    To clarify the existing laws, which are patterned after U.S. securities laws, the committee recommends separating investors into three categories based on their access to information: &quot;insiders&quot; such as company employees or leading shareholders; &quot;semi-insiders&quot; such as stockbrokers, accountants, lawyers, government officials and other employees who by contract or law have access to information; and &quot;general recipients&quot; such as journalists or spouses and relatives of other insiders.    The report defines inside information as any unannounced information that may affect share price movements, such as mergers with other companies, new stock offerings, substantial revisions of earnings estimates, and new technological or product developments. In addition to equities, transactions involving convertible bonds, warrants and corporate bonds would also be covered.    The report also recommends that securities firms be required to strengthen internal information controls, especially those which separate the flow of information between underwriting and sales divisions. And officials at Japan's eight stock exchanges will be asked to step up market surveillence.    Critics of the proposal, however, say enforcement will remain a problem. The Finance Ministry, for example, says it has only about 140 officials involved in investigating securities violations, compared with nearly 600 at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. So far, there have been no proposals to increase the staff or the budget.    And although the proposed revisions will give Finance Ministry officials greater authority to investigate violations, there is no guarantee that will result in more prosecutions because it will still be up to the police to bring charges and prosecute. The police have prosecuted a handful of securities fraud cases, but to date no one has ever been prosecuted for insider-trading violations.    The Finance Ministry is expected to submit the proposed revisions to the Diet before the current session ends in May. But analysts say it could be at least a year before any changes are actually implemented.    (Revised WSJ Feb. 25, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
