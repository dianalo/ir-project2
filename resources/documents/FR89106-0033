L. No. 98-613,16 U.S.C. 1851) required the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary ofthe Interior to conduct a comprehensive annual survey of the Atlantic stripedbass fisheries. Each survey was to include, but not be limited to, a compilationand assessment of the recreational and commercial landings of striped bassin the coastal states during the period considered in the survey. The resultsof each annual survey were to be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> This report presents data for calendar year1987 as required by section 6 of the Atlantic Striped Bass ConservationAct (The Act). The Act was signed into law on October 31, 1984. Under the Act, no fundswere authorized for appropriation for activities in fiscal year 1985. Forfiscal years 1986 and 1987, funds were authorized but not appropriated.Thus, for calendar years 1985 and 1986, no funds were appropriated forconduct of the comprehensive annual survey and no separate surveys wereconducted on the Atlantic striped bass fisheries. However, the NationalMarine Fisheries Service, of the U.S. Department of Commerce, routinelycollects data on all U.S. commercial fisheries and on marine recreationalfishing on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts. Data from these surveysare used in this report to satisfy the requirements of section 6 of theAct. A description of the statistical survey procedures for the commercial landingsmay be found in ``Fishery Statistics of the United States 1977'' (U.S.Department of Commerce, 1984), and for the recreational fishery data in``Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts,1986'' (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1987). The Act addresses striped bass from Maine through North Carolina; the datapresented here are for the same area. Commercial landings of striped bassin 1987 were 0.4 million pounds, an increase of 0.1 million pounds overthe 1986 landings of 0.3 million pounds. The 1986 landings were the loweston record. Maximum landings of 14.7 million pounds were recorded in 1973,and since then landings have steadily declined. Part of the decline since1982 has resulted from restrictive regulations on the commercial fishery.Average landings for the 20 year period from 1968 to 1987 were 6.3 millionpounds. However, from 1968 to 1987, landings averaged 9.9 million pounds,while from 1978 to 1987, landings averaged only 2.6 million pounds. Forthe last 5 years, an average of 1.3 million pounds was landed. Commerciallandings by state from 1980 through 1987 are shown in Table 1. Figure 1shows annual commercial landings from 1962 through 1987. Estimates of catch and harvest of striped bass by recreational fishermenare available from the marine recreational fishery statistics surveys from1979 through 1987. Catch is defined as the total number of fish caught,including those released alive. Harvest is the number of fish which areremoved from the population. Estimated weights are available for the fishharvested. The reliability of the survey estimates is greater for specieswhich occur more frequently in the catch than for those which occur infrequentlyin the catch. In recent years, with the striped bass stocks at low levels,the estimates for striped bass are less reliable than those for other speciessuch as bluefish, winter flounder, or scup, which occur frequently in thecatch. In addition, there is high variability of striped bass catch estimatesby state from year to year. Although a separate survey of the recreationalfishery for striped bass would likely provide more reliable estimates ofthe catch and harvest of striped bass, such a survey would be extremelyexpensive to conduct. In 1987, recreational fishermen caught an estimated 886,000 striped bass,of which 50,000 were harvested. The remaining 836,000 were released alive.The estimated weight of the 1987 striped bass recreational harvest was0.9 million pounds. Table 2 presents estimates of the total recreationalcatch of striped bass by state from 1980 through 1987. The total recreational catch of striped bass declined from about 2.0 millionfish in 1979 to about 600,000 fish in 1983-1985. As with the commercialfishery, restrictions on the recreational fishery contributed to the decreasein catch. The increase in total catch in 1986 likely reflects the increasedabundance of the 1982 and subsequent year classes, resulting from managementmeasures providing nearly total protection to these year classes. The numberof striped bass harvested has declined from about 1.3 million fish in 1979to 50,000 in 1986, while the number released alive has increased as a percentageof the total catch. From 1979-1981, an average of 24 percent was releasedalive; from 1982-1987, an average of 75 percent was released alive; andin 1987, 94 percent of the fish were released alive. This demonstratesthe effectiveness of size limits and bag limits in conserving striped bass.The management measures imposed on striped bass fishing by the coastalstates, as recommended by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission'sInterstate Fishery Management Plan for the Striped Bass (as amended), havehad a significant impact on the level of the recreational harvest and ofthe commercial landings. Most new management regulations were put in placebetween 1982 and 1986, with those having the most impact being implementedduring 1984, 1985, and 1986. These regulations include closed seasons,closed areas, size limits, commercial gear restrictions, and bag limitson the recreational fishery. Most significantly, a moratorium was imposedon striped bass fishing in Maryland and Delaware in January 1985. During1986, the striped bass fishery was closed in marine waters of New York,Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Several other states prohibit sale of stripedbass and have implemented a 33-inch minimum size limit. Bag limits rangefrom 1 to 5 fish in states which allow recreational fishing. Appropriate data from which to calculate estimates of striped bass populationsize have not been collected. Prior to 1982, striped bass commercial landingsdata were used as an indicator of the stock size. The commercial fisheryhas since been severely restricted by regulations; thus, landings in recentyears are not comparable to those in earlier years nor are they indicativeof trends in stock size. The recreational fishery for striped bass hasbeen similarly impacted by management regulations. Thus, caution shouldbe used in interpreting the landings data in recent years.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
