WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   House Speaker Jim Wright's use of theCongressional Record to plug a home video product made by hiswife's employer follows a long Capitol Hill tradition: Just aboutanything can be printed, and is, at taxpayers' expense.   For more than 100 years the Congressional Record has provided anuncritical compilation of remarks said _ and unsaid _ by members ofCongress.   It is printed five days a week, every week, and runs 200 or sopages on average. It costs $18 million a year, and is produced bymore than 500 government printers working through the night.   ``It's like producing the Sunday New York Times, five times aweek,'' said Duane Nystrom, editor for the CongressionalPublications Office. ``It is not a small project.''   The embattled speaker, already fighting allegations he violatedHouse ethics rules, was the object of fresh reports Monday in TheWall Street Journal about remarks he had included in theCongressional Record of Dec. 9, 1985.   His 350-word statement amounted to an effusive endorsement ofthe Pacific Institute's series of video motivational programsdesigned to enhance family togetherness and conversation.   ``Marvelously useful,'' Wright gushed. And available ``at anominal price within the range of most American families.''   Wright didn't mention the $36,000 a year annual salary that thecompany was paying his wife, Betty. Her job with another company isthe basis for some of the ethics charges now facing the speaker.   The Seattle-based Pacific Institute said it didn't ask forWright's remarks. But it reprinted them later in promoting sales ofthe tapes at $34.95 each or $400 for a full set of 21.   The revelation can't help Wright in the fight for his politicalfuture, but no one is suggesting this is the first the timeCongressional Record provided an official-looking plug.   Nor is it the first embarrassment involving the Record.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., can vouch for that. In 1986, Helmsinserted into the Record a legal brief filed by a group opposing``dial-a-porn'' telephone services, Citizens for Decency ThroughLaw.   That issue of the Congressional Record became a bestseller.Included in the brief, and printed in the record, was the full,X-rated text of one of the tapes. ``Hi, I'm Nellie from HighSociety,'' it began.   Both episodes were possible because of the way the Record isedited. It isn't.   Or at least, it isn't edited for content. Copy is edited forerrors and grammar, but little else, said Nystrom.   ``There is virtually no censorship of comments put on therecord,'' he said. ``The only thing that would be excised from therecord would be obscenities.''   Content, he said, is governed by the rules of the House andSenate. The Record prints what is said on the floor of the House orSenate, and members are free to submit additional statements.Remarks that violate the rules, such as attacks on another member,would be edited out.   In an effort to make the Record more faithfully reflect what wassaid, Congress a few years ago decided to have remarks that wereedited or added later appear in a different typeface.   But inserts can be as lengthy as a member of Congress wants.Much of the Pentagon Papers, for example, was included.   The Record is printed through the night and available the nextmorning, and it is also available electronically by computer. Ithas a press run of 24,000 copies, and Nystrom figures it costsabout $500 per page to print.   Congressional rules generally bar members from receivingbenefits as a result of improperly exerting their position, andguidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so ``affiliated witha particular enterprise'' that it creates an appearance ofimpropriety.   Wright declined to answer questions Monday about his video plug.But Nystrom says he doubts Wright's use of the Record was unique.   ``If there was something wrong with that, every member ofCongress would be guilty of doing that,'' he said. ``Everyone ...uses the Record to promote or call attention to some activitywithin their district.   ``I would see it as a matter of degrees,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
