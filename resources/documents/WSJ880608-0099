Staff members of Rep. Doug Barnard's (D., Ga.) subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, which is holding a hearing on foreign-based insider trading today, also said that despite Securities and Exchange Commission efforts to speed the referral process, the exchanges were taking longer to refer cases than they did in 1986 and 1987. The aides said their conclusions are based on data obtained from the SEC's enforcement division.    During 1987, they said, it took the New York Stock Exchange an average of 12.43 months to notify the SEC about suspected insider trading, far longer than any other of the 10 exchanges that the aides reviewed. The fastest referrals came from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which took an average of about three months. In 1986, the Big Board's 50 referrals took an average of 11.78 months, which also was the slowest of the 10 exchanges.    In addition, they said, the New York Stock Exchange in 1987 referred 53 cases to the SEC, fewer than the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which referred 87 cases, or the American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which each referred 69 cases. The aides said the Chicago options exchange's referrals took an average of about seven months to reach the SEC.    Separately, the SEC sent Congress several proposals for legislation to help it deal with the internationalization of the markets. Most significantly, the SEC proposed that it be allowed to conduct investigations in this country for foreign securities authorities. It also asked for the power to suspend or bar securities professionals who have been disciplined by foreign authorities.    As previously reported, Rep. Barnard's panel recently concluded a review of the SEC's pursuit of foreign-based insider trading. Subcommittee aides have been extremely critical not only of the SEC's performance, but also of delays by exchanges in referring suspicious trading to the agency.    A spokeswoman for the Big Board said the exchange not only makes formal referrals but also advises the SEC of suspicious trading by telephone. &quot;We only turn over to them completed, written reports that go beyond our jurisdiction&quot; of enforcing exchange rules among its members, she said. She also said that to speed the referral process, the Big Board has taken several steps, including imposing rules enabling it to fine member firms for not providing information on a timely basis, and over the last year has doubled the number of analysts in its surveillance department to 40.    Asked about the exchanges' apparent slowness in referring cases to his office, SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch said, &quot;We've noted that referrals on old trading make it more difficult to establish the facts.&quot; He also said the SEC is trying to get the exchanges to convey their referrals in 90 days or fewer.    A subcommittee aide said despite the effort, SEC records indicate that during 1988, the average age of the cases referred to the agency has worsened slightly. The aide wasn't able to provide figures comparable to previous years, however. </TEXT></DOC>
