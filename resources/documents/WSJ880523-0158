West Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain last week announced plans for a new European fighter plane after months of unsuccessful lobbying by the Pentagon and its top aerospace contractors seeking to head them off. Their move suggests that economic competition within the Western alliance is driving decisions more than military competition between West and East.    The U.S. had fought for an allied agreement to buy cheaper, American-designed models or at least a transatlantic hybrid combining features of the European and U.S. fighter jets. But national economic concerns prevailed, and they probably will on similar battles in the future. &quot;I predict a decline in the importance of strictly military issues, with economic issues dominating things,&quot; says Dennis Kloske, the Pentagon's top specialist on trade and international arms cooperation. &quot;This is a disturbing trend throughout the alliance.&quot;    Rather than forgo production opportunities, the allies are churning out four new fighter jets in the 1990s. Though the proliferation of warplanes will strain the alliance's combined military budget, it helps aerospace concerns, which create jobs and spur high-technology industrial development.    The upshot is a proliferation of costly production lines. While the four European countries proceed with the Eurofighter, the Americans will build improved versions of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 Falcon and of the F/A-18 Hornet, which is built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Northrop Corp. The French will develop the Rafale, to be built by Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation and Societe Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation. According to U.S. estimates, the total cost of all the new fighters is $80 billion.    The Eurofighter will be built by several companies in the sponsoring countries. Among the major contractors will be Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. in Germany, British Aerospace PLC, Italy's Aeritalia and Spain's Construcciones Aero nauticas S.A. Engines will be built by a consortium including Rolls-Royce PLC, MTU Group in Germany and Fiat S.p.A.'s Fiat Aviazione unit. Ferranti PLC's Ferranti Defense Systems and General Electric Co.'s Marconi Command and Control Systems Ltd., both of Britain, and AEG-Telefunken AG in Germany will work to develop the radar for the Eurofighter.    In addition, the U.S. is developing advanced warplanes, with radar-evading &quot;stealth&quot; features, for both the Navy and Air Force, at a combined cost of about $70 billion. These probably won't be exported, though.    The dizzying outlays for warplanes come just as the West is trying to beef up its ground and naval forces to offset the elimination of hundreds of nuclear weapons under the soon-to-be ratified U.S.Soviet agreement to remove intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe. Yet economic arguments, rather than military considerations, dominated the fighter plane debate. When the U.S. tried to sell F/A-18s to the French last year, Serge Dassault, president of Dassault, was quoted in the French press as saying, &quot;The purchase of F/A-18s by the French Navy will kill the Rafale in its infancy . . . The United States is conducting a merciless campaign to knock its competitors out of the world markets.&quot;    Many Europeans tend to view the Pentagon's calls for more collaboration as little more than code-language for an unwavering buy-American message. &quot;We still wait for the U.S. Air Force to buy a front line fighter from overseas,&quot; gripes a British diplomat.    The U.S. is also beginning to look out for its own contractors, even if that means passing up cheaper alternatives overseas. After eight or so years of buying more foreign military components, Congress is seeking to require that long lists of items be purchased in the U.S.    With so many Western aerospace concerns gearing up for new fighter plane production, &quot;there's going to be world-wide excess capacity,&quot; predicts David Smith, an aerospace specialist with Robert Ellsworth Co., a Washington-based consulting firm.    Making conditions worse, the new generation of aircraft will be so expensive that the Western air forces will buy fewer of them. Defense Department predictions show the Eurofighter costing as much as $60 million per plane, and the Rafale, $50 million. The new F/A-18 Hornets will run about $28 million apiece. The Pentagon's Mr. Kloske figures that the U.S. and its allies can only afford to buy three of the new planes to replace four in the current fleets.    To help cover the production costs, the U.S. and European aerospace concerns will be chasing sales elsewhere, such as the Middle East, Asia and the Third World. This strategy worked well after U.S. defense outlays slackened in the years following the Vietnam War, but it could fizzle in the 1990s. Developing countries, often burdened with debt, might be scared away by the lofty prices of the new planes. They might instead settle for upgrades of planes they already have.    In addition, several other countries, including India and Brazil, are planning to build their own fighter jets rather than rely on the U.S. or Europe. Japan is also doing so, and is expected to become a formidable contender in an already crowded export market.    Meanwhile, military planners worry that the approach taken on the Eurofighter could be echoed in a string of other big military purchases the Western allies are expected to make in coming years. These include heftier air defenses for Europe -- including a replacement of the Hawk air-defense missile -- new helicopters and upgraded artillery.    Although the allies have recently signed agreements to collaborate on about a dozen smaller weapons projects, &quot;everybody is going to spend their own money&quot; in the biggest programs, says a Pentagon official. </TEXT></DOC>
