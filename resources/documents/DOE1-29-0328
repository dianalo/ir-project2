For determining effectson cell viability, function and morphology, exposures were conductedfor 20 hours at either 30 or 37 deg. C in Leighton culture tubes of polystyrenepetri dishes. In both instances, cells were attached to glass. Cell viabilitydose-response curves were obtained with H{sub 3}O{sup +} (HCl and H{sub2}SO{sub 4}), SO{sub 2} (dissolved gas), HSO{sub 3}{sup -}, SO{sub 3}/sup=/ and SO{sub 4}/sup =/. Buffer strength and pH were varied to determinethe effect of these various molecular species on viability. Sulfur dioxidegas exhibited a weak protentiating effect on H{sub 3}O{sup +} toxicitybelow pH 6.4. Significant viability loss did not occur above pH 6.4.Particle uptake was diminished significantly at sulfite concentration{ge} 500 uM, pH 7.2. Sulfite was found to be a potent competitive inhibitorof GSH-peroxidase in vitro. A slight yet significant change in cell morphologyoccurred at sulfite concentrations of 200 uM and 4000 uM and pH 7.2.There was a significant difference in O{sub 2} utilization between controland 4000 uM exposed cells, indicating a potential diminution in cell-surfacemediated respiratory stimulation. Based on these studies, sulfur dioxidegas exposure may have an effect on alveolar macrophage function dependingon the ambient concentration of the gas and its accumulation in the airspacesof the lung.</TEXT></DOC>
