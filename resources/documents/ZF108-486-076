(Hardware Review) (one of sixfacsimile modems evaluated) (evaluation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bethoney, Herb; Damore, Kelley.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Orchid Technology's OrchidFax Modem is a facsimile modem thatenables Apple Macintoshes to send and receive facsimiletransmissions of superior quality to those produced by stand-alonemachines.andP;  The OrchidFax is one of the most feature-filled of themodems tested and it has the advantage of being networkcompatible.andP;  It rated as the second best modem tested, being verysimilar to Circuit Research Corp's FlexFax, with which it was ableto exchange programs, files and facsimiles.andP;  OrchidFax comes witha version of BackFax with FreeTerm 2.0, and can convert files fromMacPaint, PICT, EPS and TIFF into BackFax facsimiles.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Orchid Technology Inc. (products).andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (equipment and supplies)Orchid Technology OrchidFax Modem (Facsimile modem).andO;Topic:     EvaluationModemsFacsimile.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Orchid TechnologyandM;ORCHIDFAX MODEMandM;The capabilities of the OrchidFax are similar to those of FlexFax, and itperformed on par with FlexFax.andM;Bundled software includes an OrchidFax version of BackFax with FreeTerm 2.0.andO;Orchid's BackFax program contains all the features of the version bundledwith FlexFax.andM;Because they share similar capabilities, both OrchidFax and FlexFax canexchange files and programs with each other at 2,400 bps, and faxes at 9,600bps.andM;The difference between the two modems is apparent in the LEDs.andP;  Eight LEDs,as opposed to FlexFax's three LEDs, are featured on the front panel of theunit.andP;  In addition, the OrchidFax lacks FlexFax's serial pass-through port.andM;Orchid Technology, of Fremont, Calif., can be reached at (415) 683-0300.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;At McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., in Huntington Beach, Calif., theOrchidFax is used on a Microsoft Mail server, according to Senior Manager OrvJordahl.andM;&quot;The OrchidFax is reliable,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The interface is especially nicebecause it allows us to send mail messages over the facsimile.andP;  The employeeslove it.&quot;andM;Jordahl chose the OrchidFax for its price and speed.andP;  &quot;For future growth, Iwanted something that had file-transfer capability.andP;  The OrchidFax has9,600-bps file transfers,&quot; he said.andM;Chris Kline, a sales manager at MicroAge Computer Stores Inc., a computerretailer in Chicago, agreed.andP;  &quot;I focused on the 9,600-bps speed,&quot; he said.andO;Kline found the background feature especially beneficial because it allowsusers to accomplish their day-to-day activities with the fax transmissionsrunning in the background.andM;----------Editor's Note: Dove Computer Corp., of Wilmington, N.C., and PrometheusProducts Inc., of Tigard, Ore., were unable to send PC Week their Mac faxmodems in time for inclusion in this review.andM;Of the six Macintosh facsimile modems that PC Week evaluated, CypressResearch Corp.'s FaxPro is the only one that can be used in a networkenvironment without being modified.andM;FaxPro works on either an AppleTalk network without a network operatingsystem via the FaxPro Share software, or on server-based architecture, suchas AppleShare, and distributed network operating systems, such as TOPS.andM;PC Week tested the FaxPro on an AppleShare network and the FaxPro Shareversion with AppleTalk.andM;In both types of networks, the FaxPro sent and received faxes just as easilyas in the single-user mode.andP;  The only difference between the single-user andnetwork modes was that when used on a network, the faxes resided in fax-outand fax-in folders on the file server instead of on the sender's workstation.andM;FaxPro includes a site license with both versions, eliminating the need tobuy additional software when network nodes are added.andM;Because the OrchidFax, FlexFax 9624 and AppleFax modems support BackFax, theycan be used on a network with Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Mail 2.0 ($395 forone user; $125 for each additional user) and Solutions Inc.'s FaxGate gatewaysoftware ($395).andM;While residing on the fax server, FaxGate acts as a gateway between MicrosoftMail and BackFax.andM;PC Week tested the three fax modems on an AppleTalk network using MicrosoftMail 2.0 and FaxGate.andP;  Under FaxGate, they successfully transmitted E-mailand documents as faxes.andM;Each workstation must have MailMaker ($40), Solution's mail-station program,to create and send faxes.andP;  Documents and E-mail messages were easy to send asfaxes from a workstation, and the whole process went smoothly.andM;Solutions bundles five copies of MailMaker with FaxGate and plans to ship aversion of FaxGate for CE Software Inc.'s QuickMail in June.andM;Solutions Inc., of Williston, Vt., can be reached at (802) 865-9220.andM;-- Herb Bethoney</TEXT></DOC>
