In March, Carsey-Werner sued Viacom and asked that the U.S. District Court in New York establish a trust for Carsey-Werner's share of syndication revenues for the popular television show, estimated at about $350 million. Carsey-Werner said at the time that Viacom had &quot;failed and refused&quot; to provide assurances that the revenues would be protected from creditors' liens or other claims that might be related to Viacom's leveraged-buyout sale to National Amusements Inc., a Dedham, Mass.-based theater-chain operator.    Viacom has said it plans to sell &quot;Cosby Show&quot; rerun rights to local TV stations.    Stuart Glickman, an attorney for Carsey-Werner, said the related action to bar the buyout was filed because Viacom's proxy statement for a June 3 shareholder meeting on the proposed acquisition indicates that Viacom will be in an &quot;extremely extended financial position&quot; after the transaction closes. He said Carsey-Werner is concerned that Viacom intends to treat the money due Carsey-Werner &quot;as its own asset&quot; and pledge it to creditors as part of the buyout plan.    Mr. Glickman, who said Carsey-Werner isn't seeking to block the Viacom meeting, said the federal court hadn't yet acted on the initial request for a trust for Carsey-Werner's share of &quot;Cosby Show&quot; revenues.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
