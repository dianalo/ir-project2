<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-0327 </DOCNO><TEXT>The role of interstitial atoms in solid solution hardening and mechanicalproperties of monocrystals of single-phase alloys are considered. Changein hardening mechanisms as a result of alloying which causes change indislocation distribution and interaction character is traced. Creep processcontrolled by dislocation climb and slip as well as dislocation interactionwith the second phase precipitations in the hardening processes are analyzed.The hardening mechanism of ordered alloys and dependence of mechanicalproperties (yield strength and creep) on the order parameter is shown.Plasticity and strength of intermediate phases in binary metal systemsare considered. 232 refs.; 43 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
