It claims as much as 7.7% of their salaries. Yetthey fear they won't get much back come retirement.   Compounding the unease: Many people hear nary a word fromthe government program in the decades between signing up fora Social Security number and applying for their benefits.</LP><TEXT>   But Social Security is too important to ignore. Workingpeople can and should bridge the gap of silence -- to getbenefits estimates that can help in planning for retirementand evaluating insurance needs, and to ensure that theyultimately get every penny for which they're eligible.   The Social Security Administration recommends that peoplecheck the agency's records of their earnings every threeyears or so. Omissions &quot;aren't common, but when they happenthey can be a nightmare,&quot; a spokesman says.   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy forthe American Association of Retired Persons, learnedfirst-hand the value of checking Social Security's records.He requested his information a few years back just to seewhat AARP members could expect. What he found was a two-yeargap when his earnings as a Senate staffer weren't recorded atall.   Such gaps could saddle a person with a lower retirementbenefit than deserved because of the way Social Securitybenefits are calculated. They're based on people's averageearnings in their 35 highest-paid years, translating allfigures into today's dollars. People could be penalized, forexample, if some high earnings at the peak of their careersare omitted and replaced in the calculation by zeros or bypay from years when they were just starting out.   Less than 1% of eligible wages aren't credited to people'srecords, the Social Security Administration says. Andcorrecting an error is fairly easy if a person knows itexists: Just contact Social Security with W-2 forms or otherrecords that verify wages and Social Security taxes for theperiod in question. Unfortunately, many don't discoveromissions until retirement age, if at all.   Back in 1987, the General Accounting Office reported that$58.5 billion in earnings between 1978 and 1984 apparentlyhad been left off people's Social Security records. Thosewere wages that employers had reported to the InternalRevenue Service, but not to Social Security.   A stepped-up effort by the Social Security Administrationto resolve such discrepancies has resulted in $36 billion ofthose earnings being credited to people's records. But theagency spokesman says the remainder hasn't been credited, inmany cases because Social Security couldn't find theindividual or the company involved.   Finding out about what's in your Social Security earningsrecord is easy. Stop by a Social Security office or calltoll-free (800/234-5SSA) to get a request form for a freePersonal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (Pebes).Answer a few questions on the form, mail it in, and get thePebes in about four weeks.   That same statement also contains benefits estimates,including those that would be paid if a person dies orbecomes disabled. Those figures are important in evaluatinglife insurance and disability insurance needs.   &quot;Social Security isn't just a retirement program. You'rebuying enormous lifetime protection,&quot; says Judy Schub, alobbyist for the AARP.   Still, the estimates of retirement benefits may be themost valuable part of the Pebes statement for people startingto think about leaving the work force. That's a new featureSocial Security added about two years ago.   The statement shows the benefits that people might expect,expressed in today's dollars, if they retire at threedifferent ages. People can look at those figures as apercentage of their current salary to get a sense of how muchof their working income Social Security might replace.   One message that is likely to come through very clearly isthat Social Security alone is far from enough.   The government program will generally replace about 60% ofearnings for a worker who has always earned the minimum wage,but only about 28% for someone who has always earned themaximum pay covered by Social Security -- currently $51,300.The percentage is even lower for people earning more.   Meanwhile, a rule of thumb is that retirees, to becomfortable, need income equal to 70% of their final pay.Some will need less. But others will require 100% of theirworking income in the early years of retirement, at least ifthey want to reach goals such as traveling a lot ormaintaining two homes, says Cleveland financial planner KarenSpero.   Keep in mind that the benefit figures in the Pebes areonly estimates. &quot;The closer a person is to retirement, themore accurate those estimates will be,&quot; says Malcolm A.Makin, a Westerly, R.I., planner. The actual payouts willdepend on people's earnings between now and retirement and,of course, on any changes in Social Security's benefitformulas.   It's also important to understand some of the assumptionsthat underlie the figures. For instance, when Social Securityprojects a person's benefit at age 62, age 65 and age 70, theagency is assuming that the person keeps working to thoseages -- not that he or she would quit earlier and delaycollecting benefits.   Even people who don't ask for Pebes reports may eventuallyfind something like them in their mailboxes. A law passedlast year requires the Social Security Administration by theyear 2000 to send people their earnings records and in somecases benefits estimates every other year.   Meanwhile, getting a Pebes report may give some people aneeded push to start retirement planning.   People should begin to analyze their finances 10 to 15years before they expect to retire, advises Dallas Salisbury,president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute inWashington.   But when do they really do it? &quot;Eighteen to 36 monthsbefore they plan to retire, if they are really behaved,&quot; Mr.Salisbury says. &quot;And right after retirement if they aretypical.&quot;   ---                  Social Security's Role                   In Retirement Income                                                                                                          Sources of income, on average, for retirees with at least$20,000 in annual income in 1986                                                                                                          Investments ...........................  34%                                                                                                          Earned Income .........................  24%                                                                                                          Social Security .......................  21%                                                                                                          Pensions ..............................  19%                                                                                                          Other .................................   2%                                                                                                          Source: Social Security Administration</TEXT></DOC>
