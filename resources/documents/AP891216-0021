Per capita income in the United States last year was $19,780,compared with $18,580 in 1987. In Japan, the income rose from$15,840 to $21,040, the World Bank reported Friday. The bank gaveall incomes in U.S. dollars.   The World Bank arrives at its figures by dividing the value of acountry's total production, the gross national product, by itspopulation. Per capita income thus includes people without income,such as children, and non-wage income, such as returns oninvestments.   The Swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a1988 average of $27,260, up from $21,310 in 1987.   Mozambique ranked lowest among the 152 members of the World Bankwith a 1988 annual per capita income of $100.   The United States, which in 1987 ranked second only toSwitzerland in per capita income, was fifth last year, behindSwitzerland, Japan, Iceland and Norway.   Much of the rise in the Japanese income can be attributed to anincrease in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar, aswell as to increased Japanese production. Elsewhere, differencescould be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared withother currencies. The dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fallthat began in 1985.</TEXT><NOTE>Study Finds Deepening Hardship Among Latino Families, Children</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new study released says the economicexpansion of the 1980s has least benefited U.S. Latinos.   Nearly one-fifth of Hispanic families are living in poverty asthe decade ends, according to the study released Friday by theNational Council of La Raza.   The study found widespread poverty among Hispanic families ledby women, deepening hardships for married-couple families andsignificant numbers of poor Latino children.   ``Hispanics made many gains in the 1980s, politically andsocially, especially in visibility and growth,'' said La Razapresident Raul Yzaguirre. ``But unfortunately, the economic picturefor Hispanics worsened at the same time.''   La Raza, a non-profit Hispanic research and advocacyorganization, said Hispanics were concentrated in low-wage jobs,overrepresented in industries with declining employment and morelikely to lose their jobs through plant closings.   Hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country,with only 51 percent of Latinos 25 and older completing four yearsof high school or more, compared with 78 percent of non-Hispanics.   The increasing number of Hispanic families led by women is alsoa factor, as those families tend to be poor, the study said. In1980, 21.8 percent of Hispanic families were led by women, but by1988, women-led families accounted for 23.4 percent of Hispanicfamilies.</TEXT></DOC>
