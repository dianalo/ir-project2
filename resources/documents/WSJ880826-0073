U.S. officials said the review is purely a trade-law matter and isn't related to the State Department's recent protest against the deportation of Palestinian political activists from Israeli-occupied territory. Indeed, officials said the State Department had argued against the trade representative's decision to review the case.    This is the first time the U.S. has used its trade laws to test Israel's human-rights record. The White House also ordered similar reviews of the labor practices of Syria, Malaysia, Burma, Haiti and Liberia.    These reviews are authorized by a 1984 trade statute that requires countries with duty-free treatment in the U.S. to observe workers' rights. As a result of earlier reviews, the U.S. ousted Nicaragua and Romania from this program, which is called the Generalized System of Preferences, and suspended the benefits of Chile and Paraguay.    Yesterday, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter also announced that he had turned down petitions to subject El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey to similar reviews.    But Venezuela's Generalized System of Preferences status will come under a review authorized by another trade-law provision that denies participation in the program to countries that expropriate U.S. property, Mr. Yeutter said.    The complaint against Israel was filed by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in June. The Washington-based pro-Arab lobby accused Israel of denying trade-union rights to more than 100,000 Palestinians who commute from homes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to work in Israel. A U.S. trade official said inquiries by the Labor Department and the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem uncovered &quot;enough evidence to warrant a continued investigation&quot; of the complaint.    A spokesman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington said, &quot;Israel doesn't violate the rights of workers.&quot; He added that &quot;the charges will be refuted.&quot;    The decision to review the complaint comes on the heels of a strong protest by the State Department over Israel's decision last week to deport 25 Palestinians. Using extremely tough diplomatic language, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, speaking for the vacationing Secretary of State George Shultz, expressed &quot;shock&quot; about the deportation decision, in a private meeting Monday with a senior Israeli official.    There could be further strains in U.S.-Israeli relations in coming weeks. According to diplomatic officials, Mr. Whitehead noted at the meeting that the United Nations Security Council is considering a statement criticizing the deportations and hinted that the U.S. might join in expressing opposition to Israel's policy. In January, a month after the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began, the U.S. voted in favor of such a resolution. It later abstained in a similar U.N. vote.    Israel has expelled 33 Palestinians since the unrest began. The Reagan administration says the expulsions violate international law, but Israel rejects this, saying that its high court has determined the deportations are legal.    Israel sent $487 million of duty-free shipments to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences program last year. Israel concurrently benefits from a 1986 free-trade association with the U.S., but the pact won't remove all tariffs until 1995.    The AFL-CIO lodged the petitions against Syria, Burma, Haiti and Malaysia, and a lawyers' group filed the complaint against Liberia. U.S. officials will hold public hearings in October and make further inquiries overseas before ruling on the complaints. It will be the next administration's task to announce the outcome. The decisions will be handed down at the same time the annual review of the entire Generalized System of Preferences program is to be completed on April 1. </TEXT></DOC>
