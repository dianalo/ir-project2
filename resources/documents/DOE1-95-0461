<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0461 </DOCNO><TEXT>A /sup 3/He insert-refrigerator designed for proximate measurements at0.32-300 K temperature in strong magnetic fields in the UIS-1 cryostatsis described. The insert has the external diameter of 40 mm and copperbath for /sup 3/He has the volume of 3 cm/sup 3/. The insert operatedin a stationary magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid with magneticinduction not exceeding 8 T. The sample cooling time from 300 K to 0.32K is 1 h. The insert can operate at 0.32 K temperature for about 5 hours.</TEXT></DOC>
