And if the rush of oncoming technology is anything like the rushof hormones, home computing is going to see changes at least asdramatic as puberty and maybe as painful.   Figure the beginnings of personal computing from 1975, with theintroduction of the Altair 8800 to 1977 with Apple and Radio Shack.Since the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981, the notion of apersonal computer has become commonplace and the very idea ofhaving one no longer draws much attention. Now the focus is whatthe machines will do.   For all the talk from hobbyists who have figured out ways tocomputerize everything from sundials to switches, personalcomputers for most of us do four things: They process words, theycount money, they play games, they file things.   Word processing, financial spreadsheets, games and data basesall existed before personal computers. They were calledtypewriters, calculators and pencils, board games and filingcabinets. Putting a computer to work on those tasks enhanced themin some ways and made them easier to perform, but didn't basicallychange them. A hand-calculated spreadsheet is exactly like acomputer-calculated spreadsheet, the difference being drudgery.   The next few years of personal computing may see somethingdifferent springing from three major and interrelated developments.The tremendous growth of processing power, data storage andhandling techniques and ``interconnectivity'' may contribute tofundamental changes in many areas of ordinary life.   Take processing power, the raw ability of a computer to handleinformation. It has two ordinary measurements, the speed at whichthe computer performs instructions and the number of bits (binarydigits) the machine is able to handle at once.   The last 10 years or so have seen a change from machines thatcould process around 800,000 instruction per second and handle 8bits at a time to machines that rip through 20 million instructionsper second and handle 32 bits at a time.   A machine with that power can handle multi-tasking (doing morethan one job at the same time) and can be equipped with verysophisticated software. It isn't stretching things to say that theindividual can have more raw computing power sitting on a desktopthan was available in entire rooms of computer gear not many yearsago. A computer on that level is perfectly capable of running asmall home business in the basement, a terminal for word processingand doing a search in a data base _ all at once.   Even with the power of a single chip, more power and productionmay be had by grouping the chips and having each of them work on adifferent part of a given task at the same time. That's calledparallel processing and it's a computer version of ``many handsmake light work.''   Since it's unreasonable to expect that the growth of computingpower is going to stop, it isn't outlandish to begin to wonderwhether our homes will replace individual computers for familymembers with a central computer just as central heating replacedthe individual room fireplaces of an earlier time.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
