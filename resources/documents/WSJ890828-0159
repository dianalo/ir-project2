In September, Enimont will offer 850 million shares valued at more than 1.2 trillion lire ($853 million) to Italian and foreign investors.    As Enimont's chairman, Mr. Necci is trying to convince investors that this offspring of an uneasy marriage between state-owned EniChem S.p.A. and part of private-sector Montedison S.p.A. can develop into a formidable -- and homogeneous -- force in international markets.    In size alone, Enimont already is a world player. Its estimated sales this year of 16 trillion lire and net income of 1.1 trillion lire would place it 52nd in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 biggest non-U.S. industrial concerns -- behind Sweden's Electrolux AB but ahead of Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. After next month's offering, it will have the fourth-largest market capitalization of any Italian company.    &quot;It will be one of the few Italian stocks traded internationally,&quot; says Paolo-Filippo Lardera, an analyst at UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew. Mr. Lardera expects Italian mutual funds and institutional investors to buy heavily. &quot;In the short to medium term, I'm very positive&quot; about the issue, he says.    But Enimont also has some problems: It is overstaffed and has inefficient internal distribution, and the two groups that formed it often duplicate efforts. It gets the vast majority of its sales in Italy. Its debt of 6.4 trillion lire is twice shareholders' equity. Its product line is concentrated in the highly cyclical and mature base-chemicals business. And, as a result of its government-private sector origins, it is prone to culture clashes.    Mr. Necci, who came from the state side, is optimistic in spite of the challenges. &quot;The problem in all mature sectors is to rationalize,&quot; he says. &quot;We are doing it in Italy, and we hope to do it across Europe.&quot; He says Enimont should save around 500 billion lire a year just by eliminating overlap between Montedison and Enichem plants and by improving logistics. &quot;That alone would make forming the company worthwhile,&quot; he says.    The next step will be to streamline the company's portfolio through acquisitions, joint ventures and asset sales. &quot;We want to stay only in the markets where we have cost leadership, technology leadership or market leadership -- preferably all three,&quot; Mr. Necci says.    Mr. Necci points to Enimont's agreement last month to buy Orkem S.A.'s low-density polyethylene while selling the French state-owned company its Vedril subsidiary, which produces acrylic glass. The transaction will boost Enimont's international presence, Mr. Necci says: &quot;After it is completed, we will get 22% of our sales abroad instead of 14%.&quot; He adds that Enimont plans more acquisitions to raise its proportion of foreign sales closer to the industry average of 50%.    But the company might not be in a strong position for acquisitions. &quot;Enimont's balance sheet is among the weaker in the sector,&quot; says Alan Norris, European chemicals analyst at County Natwest Securities in London. He adds that rivals such as West Germany's BASF AG have spent the past few years rebuilding their balance sheets, and some have cash hoards.    Mr. Necci replies that after a capital increase and the share offering, the company's debt should equal equity. He adds that ENI and Montedison, which each own 40% of the company, have agreed to plow their Enimont dividends back into the company for three years.    Perhaps most worrying for Enimont is that most of its sales are in base and commodity chemicals; fine and specialty chemicals made up just 6.3% of sales in 1988. Because of low oil prices and strong economic growth, base chemicals have had strong profits in recent years. But, says County Natwest's Mr. Norris, &quot;demand for base chemicals is slowing in response to higher interest rates and governments' efforts to try to cool their economies.&quot; He expects slower profit growth in the next few years.    Enimont is trying to counter that by spending 400 billion lire a year on developing new specialty forms of its existing base chemicals -- for instance, a fireproof version of polyvinyl chloride -- where profit margins would be higher.    &quot;Am I worried about a downturn?&quot; Mr. Necci asks. &quot;Yes, like all businessmen. I have to be worried.&quot; He says Enimont's future profits &quot;will depend on many things: the economy, the dollar, demand&quot; for its products. &quot;But I think that with our lower cost of production and market share, we'll be one of the companies that will have better results&quot; in a downturn. </TEXT></DOC>
