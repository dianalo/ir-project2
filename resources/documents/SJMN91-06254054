Although thefootball team won the Big West Conference title and a trip to the CaliforniaBowl, expenses outran revenue by $530,000 for the '90-91 fiscal year. Astudent-fee hike approved last spring will net athletics an extra $450,000 forthe '91-92 fiscal year, but that is expected to be offset by a poor footballschedule and a $274,000 reduction in state funding. The bottom line is thatBrennan still had to trim between $200,000 and $300,000 from his '91-92 budgetas of August and has yet to provide the university with a balanced budget. Hemade some headway in balancing the budget by eliminating fourassistant-coaching positions in August, bringing to 16 the number ofdepartment jobs cut since November.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SJS'S BRENNAN REMAINS OPTIMISTIC  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  SPECIAL REPORT -- INSIDE SJS ATHLETICS; Third of three parts  </MEMO><TEXT>     In the following question-and-answer session, Brennan explains hisoptimism, the consequences if it proves to be unfounded and his long-termplans. He also addresses allegations that his budget-cutting measures havereflected an insensitivity to women's athletics.; Q How do you plan toincrease donations from alumni and friends when, historically, contributionshave been poor?;   A We have some room to get back to the status quo at SanJose State. Last year, we were below even what the school normally is able toraise, so we have the opportunity to regress to our mean, I guess you couldsay. There has been a lot of struggle and controversy in the athletic program,and I think we lost some major boosters because of it. I don't think it can beaccomplished overnight, but I think there are people in the community (who)may be ready to step forward now that some things have changed.; Q How longcan the program continue at the current level of support?;   A I'm workingwith a two-year time frame. . . . I don't think that right now we're worriedabout our status as a Division I-A program. I think the immediate concern isscaling down the program even more than it is. . . . Right now we have atiering system as to how we fund our different teams. Men's and women'sbasketball, volleyball and football are at the top. If external supportdoesn't increase, there will be a meaningful reduction in operations. We willnot drop sports, because we're at 14, which is at the Division I-A minimum.But we may have to say to our coaches, &quot;You can't sign out-of-state athletesanymore.&quot; And then it's dropping people.; Q In what financial shape did youexpect the SJS athletic program to be at this point?;   A I did not anticipatethat our fiscal posture would be as weak. I knew that the challenges at aschool like San Jose State are considerable. I'd heard about all the rifts andproblems here. But the one thing I didn't anticipate was the lack of fiscalsupport from the school because of the cut in support from the state system. Idon't think anybody anticipated the kind of shift in conditions caused by thestate cutbacks.; Q Since your firing of two women administrators and hiring ofa male administrator, we've received letters from people who contend you'reinsensitive to the women's athletic program and women in athletics in general.What's your response?;   A I would say that the argument that I'm not insupport of women's athletics or women in general is not true and is far fromthe truth. I eliminated three positions. Two were women and one was a man. AndI hired one man as a manager. . . . The fact is, I have three administratorsnow and two are men and one is a woman. I'm looking at a situation where I canbe measured and evaluated by the model that exists now.; Q How long will it bebefore you're able to resurrect positions that have been eliminated forbudgetary reasons?;   A I don't anticipate that's going to happen in the nearfuture.; Q Where do you see this program five years from now?;   A The No. 1goal is to promote the integrity of the academic-athletic milieu. It'simportant that we promote the graduation experience for our student-athletes.The other main goal is to maintain a Division I-A program and promote theimage and visibility of our university, and develop a partnership with thecommunity. The notion of partnership is important. I see the football programwith an improved status, and I think this school needs a field house. You wantto see the school grow. You need a vision, even if you have income problems atthe moment.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RIC BUCHER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910910  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  867  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 10, 199100254054,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
