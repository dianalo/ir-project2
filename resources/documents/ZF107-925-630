 has finally settled down; theconversion to off-the-shelf workstations is nearly complete.andP;  The result isthat the prospective customer now has a real choice not only of softwarecapabilities but also of hardware platforms.andP;  It is interesting that most ofthe &quot;players&quot; are the same as they were ten years ago, when all systems ranon proprietary hardware.andP;  Many of the people have changed, but the productstoday are, for the most part, descendants of the systems we were seeing andusing a decade ago.andM;Some of the new software and systems have been in place for a few years(Magna and Ultimate), but most of the vendors have completed theirtransitions quite recently.andP;  The rundown of companies in new guises now lookslike this:andM;* Quadex, acquired by Compugraphic in 1979, has moved from its proprietaryterminals to the Sun386i.andP;  Graph Expo marked the formal launching of the newversion.andM;* Compugraphic's Integrator runs on a standard '386 machine with aproprietary graphics controller, which means that it doesn't runoff-the-shelf MS-DOS programs and it takes a few months for CG to react whennew machines are released.andP;  It runs under a version of Unix.andM;* Penta has stuck by Data General as its supplier of a central file server,but it has completed its transition to the PC as the workstation.andP;  It isdeveloping all of its new software modules to run under DOS and MicrosoftWindows, and at Graph Expo it announced the capability to support DOS andData General networks on the same file server.andM;* Alphatype was one of the first companies to support PCs on its system, theMultiSet, and it still has one of the largest, most loyal customer bases inthe industry.andP;  But the company has taken a long time to develop a systemrunning under MS-DOS.andP;  Its initial attempt, which used a Tops network, hasbeen replaced by a Novell version that is now being installed and used inproduction.andM;* CCI ceased to exist under that name in 1986, but its key personnel kept aversion of the product alive on the PC as Magna Computer Systems.andP;  UsingNovell networks, Magna probably has installed more commercial systems basedon PCs than any other vendor.andM;* EIT met a fate similar to CCI's, but its software formed the basis of earlyversions of the Ultimate system (although, Ultimate says, most of the codehas been rewritten).andM;*Bedford went through a devastating purge, a drawn-out legal battle over useof investment funds, and reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but ithas perservered and come through the ordeal with potentially the mostversatile and innovative product line in the market.andP;  It offers qualitycomposition on Sun, Mac and PC platforms, with the Mac product now sportingthe true Macintosh user interface and multitasking.andM;* Itek's products of a decade ago--the Quadritek and the CPS system--weren'treally aimed at commercial type shops.andP;  The former filled a key niche inin-plant markets, while the latter was basically a newspaper system.andP;  Now thecompany, which has been in and out of acquisitions and buyouts for most ofthe decade, is part of AB Dick and offers two lines: the PC-based InPrintproduct for in-plant use and the Designitek, running on a Sun386i, for usersrequiring higher quality.andP;  The CPS system, meanwhile, has been acquired byComputer Peripheral Sciences, which focuses on newspapers and didn't appearat Graph Expo.andM;* Varityper has kept mum about its plans for the Epics system, which has beeninstalled in nearly as many sites as Quadex systems.andP;  It is still based on aproprietary operating system and workstations.andM;* Linotype developed its PC/DesqView-based Series 2000 system as areplacement for the CRTronic family, but it hasn't enthralled the U.S.andO;market, perhaps because the network version has been slow to materialize.andP;  InEurope, where networks don't seem to be as crucial, it is faring much better.andO;The Series 2000 wasn't demonstrated at Graph Expo and won't be covered here.andM;* Berthold, which has made a nice transition to Sun and PC workstations, hasleft the U.S.andP;  market, at least temporarily, so it didn't appear at GraphExpo and isn't included here.andM;* Atex has been a formidable competitor in the magazine market for years,basing its systems on proprietary terminals and operating systems.andP;  It hasrecently conducted beta testing of its PC Page Makeup system, with the betasite holding the distinction of being the first Atex customer not to use aproprietary DEC-based system.andP;  Atex wasn't at Graph Expo.andM;New faces.andP;  There are also newer faces in the competition, although some ofthem aren't focusing primarily on commercial type shops.andP;  This groupincludes:andM;* Miles 33, which has ported its software to the Sun platform and now offersa more flexible, interactive program suitable for applications such asmagazine makeup.andM;* Xyvision, with a six-year product history, is a relative newcomer in thismarket, but it has recently demonstrated a move from its home-grownworkstations to DEC hardware.andM;* Bestinfo, achieving most of its success in the magazine market, started onthe PC and remains there.andM;* Dewar, a crossover from the newspaper market, which remains its primefocus, now finds that the commercial market is driving its development, as wenote below.andP;  Dewar has switched from proprietary hardware to the PC.andM;Missing from the U.S.andP;  commercial market of ten years ago are AKI, which wasacquied by Atex and then abandoned, Imlac, acquired in turn by Royce andScitex before disappearing; and Pagitek, which has been in and out of theU.S.andM;System pricing.andP;  With so many new products in this market, we thought itwould be interesting to provide some rough pricing information--not for usein planning a purchase, but to get a feeling for where these products sit.andO;One thing we learned from the exercise is that this class of system is moreexpensive than we thought it would be.andP;  Although it is possible to get abasic system for about $10,000 per user, the price is likely to be more like$15,000-$20,000.andM;In the following configurations, we have tried to include all of the hardwareand software needed to connect workstations, but we haven't tried to makeevery configuration identical, such as in amount of memory or disk storage.andO;These configurations are intended to represent appropriate platforms to runthe company's top-of-the-line software.andP;  (Where PCs are involved, we havepresumed a '386 machine with hard disk for a price of about $6,000, unlessotherwise noted.)andM;In some cases, the software includes good pagination or tabular programs.andP;  Inothers, pagination or tabular setting may be weak.andP;  The shopper obviouslyneeds to delve deeply into how good the software is before making apurchasing decision.andM;* Quadex.andP;  A system consisting of two Sun386i workstations and two 80386 PCswith hard disks runs between $75,000 and $80,000, including all software(composition, pagination, programming language, etc.) for the Sun units.andP;  PCshave much more limited functionality.andM;* Penta.andP;  An entry-level system based on an MV 1000 with four PCs with harddisks costs about $69,000, including server, composition software, batchpagination and math.andM;* Magna.andP;  A four-PC system ('386 machines with no hard disks) with a Novellserver and all composition software, including pagination, will be functionalfor a cost of about $40,000.andP;  All PCs have the same functionality.andP;  Magnasaves expense by not requiring extra memory or local hard disks.andP;  But wewould probably recommend buying machines with hard disks anyway, which wouldadd a few thousand dollars to the price.andP;  Including PCs of the powerspecified in the other systems here brings the full price to about $54,000.andM;* Ultimate.andP;  A four-PC system based on a token-ring network, not requiring afile server, costs just under $55,000, with pagination, tables, etc.andP;  All PCshave the same functionality.andM;* Bedford.andP;  A system with four PCs and batch pagination runs from $50,000 to$80,000, depending on how many workstations have software options, such asgraphics and math.andP;  A similarly configures Mac IIcx-based system runs$72,000-$116,000.andP;  A Sun-based system is slightly higher.andM;* Xyvision.andP;  The entry-level price begins at about $100,000.andP;  The company isfocusing on large, multiple-system sales that are priced individually.andM;* Bestinfo.andP;  A four-PC system (two pagination and two editing/compositionstations) with programming language, table software and XyWrite costs about$61,000 with two stripped-down '386 PCs or about $68,000 with loaded ones.andM;* Alphatype.andP;  A four-PC system with two Workstation IV WY-SIWYG screens andtwo composition-only stations running on a Novell network with two 300-MBfile servers costs about $69,000.andP;  Alphatype doesn't sell unbundled software.andM;A.B.andP;  Dick/Itek Graphix: color DesignitekandM;The main news relating to Itek Graphix was in the color scanner area, whereItek Colour Graphix of the UK has set up an office in the U.S.andP;  (See theLatest Word.).andM;The most important development for the Designitek system was the addition ofspot color.andP;  Up to seven colors can be specified, as either RGB or CYMKpercentages.andP;  Each of the seven colors can be displayed individually, eitherin color on a color monitor or in monochrome.andP;  The system then outputs fourpieces of film for printing.andM;The company says that it has written algorithms to handle process color, butthat its current output device, the IGX 7000PS, isn't accurate enough toproduce high enough quality for process color.andP;  The 7000PS is rated at anaccuracy of six mils across the output film--about twice the generallyaccepted maximum permissible variation, and still farther from the ratings ofmachines producing high-quality color.andM;Itek Graphix also showed Designitek software running on the Sun SparcStation,which, we were told, provides 2.5 times the performance of the Sun386i.andP;  ButItek hasn't determined yet whether it will offer the Sparc unit as a product.andM;Also new is the ability to flow text on an arbitrarily curved path.andP;  Text,which can be imported or typed at the keyboard, can be edited after it hasbeen placed on the path.andM;Quadex IQ in Sun debutandM;In a status report on Agfa Compugraphic last July, we noted the company'splans to introduce a new generation of Quadex system running on the Sun386iplatform.andP;  Graph Expo provided the venue for its formal introduction.andP;  Thatnew Quadex system was the main news from Agfa CG, although it also announcedthe sale of the 5,000th Integrator in slighly more than two years.andP;  (SeeInstallations in The Latest Word for details.)andM;The Quadex system, which may have been installed in more customer sites thanany other commercial typesetting system, has been in need of an upgrade forseveral years.andP;  It has been based on proprietary technology since its initiallaunch in 1976, although a Sun-2 workstation was added in 1985 for graphicsapplications.andM;In 1987, Compugraphic demonstrated the ability to run the full Quadexcomposition program within the Sun-3 workstation, but it hadn't put togethera full system based on modern hardware.andP;  CG spent the time since thendeciding what platform it wanted as a replacement for the old Quadex systemand then taking the pieces that had already been developed and adding therest of the necessary ingredients for the new-generation product.andM;At Graph Expo, Agfa Compugraphic unveiled not only the new system, called theIQ, but also its strategy in trying to cement for itself a spot for years tocome in the market for commercial composition systems.andM;On display was a Sun386i workstation with full editing and compositioncapabilities, multiple windows, electronic mail and the other features thatcome with a Unix platform.andP;  Not demonstrated was the use of a PC for low-costinput, although Agfa described how this will be accomplished.andP;  Also notdemonstrated was support for graphics, which won't be ready until the secondsoftware release, currently scheduled for the second quarter of 1990.andM;The market.andP;  Agfa CG isn't shy about what it is trying to do.andP;  Its philosophyhas been to put together the best functional system it could offer, not tomake it the most affordable.andP;  Its choice of the 386i instead of a '386 PCmeans that the hardware for each full-function workstation will cost somewhatmore than it costs to buy hardware necessary to run a system from Magna,Ultimate or Penta, for example.andM;Software pricing is another matter.andP;  Agfa CG is bundling all systemcapabilities in the basic software price.andP;  In that perspective, the price of$14,500 for software for the first user and $12,500 for the second one arequite attractive.andP;  However, the customer can't save a few thousand dollars byskipping some features.andP;  We'll provide detailed pricing of the IQ systembelow.andP;  To see how it compares with other systems, please see theintroduction to this section.andM;CG said that in October it booked orders for 11 workstations for five sites,with a total value of more than $750,000.andM;Product overview.andP;  In general, the IQ has the same functionality as the Q5000system, with the addition of myriad features enabled by the Sun386i (multiplewindows, electronic mail, extensive backup facilities, etc.) and some newones added within the Quadex software.andP;  The IQ runs within the SunViewwindowing environment under the Sun operating system on an Ethernet network.andO;The user interface is new, of course.andP;  It supports menus, icons and keyboardcommands for most functions.andP;  Icons are available to run the various IQprograms, but the system can also be run without them.andM;The IQ provides some nice incidental features, such as the ability to set a&quot;home&quot; position that will be used when the system is started or when the userasks to &quot;go home&quot;; a status field for error reports; support for the 386i DOSwindow that can be run with a conversion program to import ASCII or EBCDICfiles or to convert Quadex files to ASCII; keyboard shortcuts (aliases) thatcan be customized for each user; online help; and the ability to linkfunctions to suit a certain production flow, such as &quot;compose and output.&quot;andM;File management.andP;  File management is flexible, as expected with a Sunplatform.andP;  All disks on the Sun network are treated as a single database,available to any user with access rights.andP;  Any user can be prohibited fromaccessing certain files, directories or disks.andM;The system supports any number of hierarchical directory levels.andP;  File namesare limited in length only by the 256-character maximum for the entire pathname.andP;  Groups of files can be copied or deleted.andP;  Backup facilities provideroutines for backing up the entire database or all files that have beenchanged since the last backup.andM;Q Edit.andP;  Files are generally stored in uncomposed format and appear as rawtext when they are called up, although it is possible to call up an handamp;j'edfile.andP;  Editing features are comprehensive, including functions to define theword or the paragraph under the cursor; a mouse and keyboard to mark thebeginning and end of a block to be selected; multiple search/replace stringsthat can be run forward or backward, globally or item by item; phrase storageunder function keys or under file names; a spelling checker; a popup menu forcopying or cutting a block of text to be inserted elsewhere; and macro keysthat can store any functions available on the system.andP;  (The mouse, popup menuand macro functions are new on the IQ).andM;Multiple editing sessions can be open at the same time in separate windows.andM;Composition and preview.andP;  Text in an editing window can be composed byissuing a command from the editing window.andP;  Composition features are the sameas on the Q5000.andP;  Handamp;j is based on a 200,000-word exception dictionary backedup by logic.andP;  Interword space is calculated from the minimum value permitted,rather than from the optimum, which is a disadvantage.andP;  But there are someother good controls over handamp;j quality.andM;After a job is composed, it appears in a separate preview window.andP;  Thepreview uses four serif and four sans serif typefaces (Times and CGTriumvirate, respectively) but displays true character heights and widths byscaling outlines on the fly.andP;  The preview can be scaled to any percentagebetween 25% and 500% of actual size.andP;  At Graph Expo, CG's Intellifont system,version 1.5, was used for scaling type, but when the IQ is released, it willuse 2.1, which will be faster, will support dynamic caching of characters andwill provide a better display, especially in smaller sizes.andP;  The speedincrease will be useful.andP;  At the show, it took more than 20 seconds todisplay an 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; page of text, but Agfa CG says that the newIntellifont program paints the same page in 15 seconds.andM;It is easy to move from one page of a document to another one by issuingcommands to go to the next, previous, first or last page, or by specifying apage number.andM;The preview serves only as a preview.andP;  It has no interactivity.andP;  Changes arealways made in the Q Edit window.andP;  This can be somewhat awkward, especiallywith the current software release, for two reasons.andP;  First, editing windowgenerally doesn't show actual, composed line endings.andP;  When this is the case,it may be difficult to locate the text to be changed, although this can bedone with the search function.andP;  Second, the cursor currently doesn't trackbetween the two screens, so if a mistakeis spotted in the preview of a pagelate in a document, the editing window might still be on the first page,requiring the user to search to the place the change is needed.andP;  Agfa CG saysit will implement cursor tracking in a later release.andM;After a change is made, it is possible to recompose the entire file bycommand, or to recompose from the beginning of the file to the cursorlocation.andP;  This is a nice feature, but it would be nicer to be able torecompose smaller portions of a file also.andM;Kerning (600 pairs per font, with default values provided for all fonts) andtracking (four tracks) are supported.andM;Composition commands.andP;  There is no doubting that the IQ--like the Q500--is acommand-driven system.andP;  The basic composition program provides an enormousnumber of commands, available from outside of the pagination program,including:andM;* 12 different indent commands (half for the left margin, half for the right)that can be saved as a group and returned to as needed.andP;  Commands enableskewing text.andM;* Mark a point and return to it, store the maximum depth and return to it,vertical justification (by inserting vertical space commands) and columnstraddles.andM;* The usual set of commands for adding lead, canceling exposure orescapement, etc.andM;* A category of &quot;special-purpose&quot; commands that enable the operator to embednontypesetting comments in text, insert numbers that are automaticallyincremented by the system, hang elements in the left or right gutters (usefulin outline format), and use a &quot;save status/restores status&quot; facility forstoring the 36 current typesetting parameters and recalling them at a latertime.andM;* Formats that can be looped, nested, chained or merged to up to eightlevels.andP;  Delay commands can be embedded to cause a format or a command to beimplemented only after another event.andM;* Hung punctuation, which isn't as flexible as with some systems, but allowsthe hanging on the right margin of the period, the comma, the hyphen, andsingle and double quotation marks, and on the left margin, the single anddouble quotation marks.andP;  All characters are hung to their full width, unlessthey are part of kerning pairs, in which case it may be modified in any ofseveral ways.andP;  Text characters can't be hung automatically, but there areways to hang elements manually by command.andM;* Generation of ligatures, fractions, superiors and inferiors.andM;Pagination.andP;  The pagination program is the same as the Quadex PaginationOption (QPO) for the Q5000.andP;  It gives the operator good control over mostaspects of pagination, with a system of priorities that give the program roomto manipulate elements close to the operator's desires.andP;  It isn't ascomprehensive as Penta's latest pagination program in some areas, such asoptions for floating illustrations, but it has some strengths, including useraccess to internal variables.andM;Since we haven't reported on the QPO for many years, we will mention a fewhighlights here:andM;* Page templates.andP;  Pagination is based on page templates that contain runningheaders/footers/folios, set up by filling in forms with numeric values ratherthan by drawing areas on a page with a mouse.andP;  They control the size of page,the number and width of columns, whether the first page is a recto or versopage, and so on.andM;* Floating illustrations.andP;  Illustrations can be specified as floating to thetop or bottom of a column or page, or to either the top or bottom.andP;  It ispossible to limit the number of illustrations that float to the top or thebottom of a column, as well as the maximum depth they can occupy, which maybe used to prevent multiple nearby illustrations from appearing together inthe same column if they would be too deep.andM;* Widow/orphan prevention.andP;  There are 20 different controls over the way textblocks break to avoid widows and orphans.andP;  They cover how many lines must bekept together at the beginning and end of paragraphs and around heads, withprovision for handling the last line differently depending on its length (thepercentage of the full line that it occupies).andP;  The user can specify the&quot;ideal&quot; amount and the &quot;adequate&quot; amount, as well as a &quot;priority&quot; value(high, medium or low) to weight each item as the pagination routine is run.andM;* Footnotes.andP;  The program automatically places footnotes at the bottom of thepage, with leading above notes, separator rules and spacing or graphicelements between footnotes handled automatically.andP;  But it doesn'tautomatically number footnotes (although the user can write a routine forthis using the programming language).andM;* Vertically justified and vertically ragged composition.andP;  For verticaljustification, the user specifies the amount of white space that may beinserted at certain places (such as around illustrations or heads, abovefootnotes or between paragraphs) and a priority for each.andP;  If text is toappear vertically ragged, the user specifies the minimum and maximum depthsthat are permitted.andM;* Multicolumn pages with column balancing.andM;Attaching PCs.andP;  Agfa CG didn't demonstrate the use of PCs on the network, butwe were told that it will be possible to connect a PC to the IQ using PCNFSand a network node.andP;  The PC will be able to run the editing program and embedIQ composition commands at the PC.andP;  It also will be possible to run thespelling checker and handamp;j from the PC command line.andM;We haven't seen how smoothly this works or what feedback the operator getsafter a file has been composed.andP;  We will be anxious to see this at the firstavailable opportunity.andM;Compatibility with Q5000.andP;  The IQ system is fully compatible with data fromthe Q5000.andP;  In version 1.0 of the software, communications will beone-directional, enabling Q5000 files to be sent to an IQ system forcomposition.andP;  There will be facilities for moving the entire Q5000 databaseto the IQ.andP;  In release 1.1, due in the second quarter, communications willrun both ways.andM;As expected, when new capabilities are added to the IQ, someincompatibilities with the 5000 will arise.andM;Output.andP;  Initially, the IQ will drive the standard CG9600 and 9700 laserimagesetters, any output device with a Compugraphic Genics RIP, and theLinotronic 300 in Cora mode.andP;  With the next release, it will add the 8600 and8400 typesetters.andM;Pricing and configurations.andP;  The basic system includes a 386i computer with 8MB of memory, a 19&quot; monochrome monitor, a 327-MB disk drive, a 3.5&quot; floppydisk drive storing 1.44 MB and a 155-MB mag tape drive in an expansion unit.andM;It uses the standard Sun keyboard.andP;  Unlike the Q6000 (and unlike Alphatypewith its Workstation III and IV), Agfa CG will not provide a Quadex keyboardfor the IQ.andP;  Because the Quadex keyboard includes about 30 more keys than theSun unit, the extra functions provided by those keys will have to be accessedthrough other means.andP;  Each key supports three levels (shift, unshift and onemore).andM;A basic system requires one master terminal, which includes the tape drive(one per site) and an output driver (board and software), plus all systemsoftware, for a price of $36,000.andP;  A second 386i running all software, butnot including the tape drive and output, costs $29,000.andP;  The third and fourthare priced at $27,000 and $25,000, respectively.andM;Agfa CG also sells the software unbundled.andP;  The first copy costs $14,500, thesecond, $12,500, the third, $11,000, and the fourth, $10,000.andP;  Site licensesare available for $50,000 to support five workstations, $4,000 each foradditional unit.andM;Also available from Agfa CG are Sun386i workstations at the same list pricethat Sun charges: $18,490 each.andM;Because of the relatively high price of the 386i workstation, we expect thatmost users will want to connect a few PCs to provide limited-functionstations for text input.andP;  A sample configuration consisting of two 386i unitsand two PCs (estimated at $6,000 each) would cost almost $80,000, includingeverything.andP;  In other words, the pricing of the IQ system isn't verydifferent from what Compugraphic has always charged for Quadex systems.andP;  Ofcourse, the new system is vastly superior to the former one in performance.andM;As we note in the introduction to this section, the IQ is more expensive thanmany other systems in this market.andP;  But a large part of the difference is inthe hardware platform, which is unquestionably more powerful than the PCsthat Ultimate, Magna and most other vendors are using.andM;Agfa CG is not offering a trade-in program for existing customers.andM;The first shipments are scheduled for January.andP;  We will prepare a full reviewof the system after initial installations have been given thorough use in aproduction environment.andM;Alphatype: ready for reawakening?andM;Graph Expo was an important show for Alphatype.andP;  Over the last three years,it has been through two serious management/financial crises.andP;  It hasexperienced severe delays in its development of a PostScript option for itstypesetters.andP;  And it has struggled through a painful--and abortive--attemptto use the Tops network for a PC-based multiterminal commercial system.andM;Undaunted, Alphatype has marched forward, enhancing its bread-and-butter CRTtypesetter, converting its composition system to Novell Netware, and bringinga PostScript typesetter to the point where it can be delivered.andP;  And it cameto the show full of confidence in its products and its future.andM;The Chestnut Group investment team that joined the company a few months agowas present, as was Don Hase, the eternal president who still calls the shotson the product front.andP;  Hase, who himself had been instrumental during acrisis a year earlier, has outlined a plan for the future that includesprominent roles for PostScript, Alphatype fonts and the standard productline.andM;Typesetters.andP;  The typesetter line now includes the new, high-productivity CRS99000 and the tabletop Alpha-Composer, both of which support the nativeAlphatype mode and PostScript through an add-in board.andM;The 99000, which carries on an historic line of CRS devices aimed at thecommercial market, has been installed in standard (non-PostScript)configuration, which is capable of outputting narrow galleys of text at arate of 42 inches per minute at a resolution of 5,300 dpi--not a bad rateeven if you take into account that it is producing only galleys.andP;  To set afull 96-pica-wide page, the output speed is 9&quot; per minute.andM;Orders are now being accepted for the PostScript version of the 99000, withshipments expected to start this year.andP;  In PostScript mode, which uses aclone RIP from MediaNet and Pipeline Associates, it will run at variableresolutions up to 5300 dpi.andP;  Not only are the resolutions selectable by theuser (such as 635, 1,270 and 2,540 dpi), but the customer actually canconfigure the machine to support any desired resolution, in one-dpiincrements.andP;  We're reproducing some samples of text and line art to show thequality attainable.andP;  No speed figures have been disclosed.andM;The typesetters can output PostScript files and graphics that have beenmerged into Alphatype files and previewed on the MultiVu.andM;As reported previously, the 99000 is an upgraded 9900.andP;  It uses a '386 CPU inAlphatype mode and a National Semiconductor NS32532 for PostScript.andP;  Pricingvaries from $78,000 to $88,000 for standard mode, and $97,000 to $106,000 forPostScript (depending on disk storage and other options).andM;Meanwhile, the PostScript version of the AlphaComposer has been installed atfour sites: one each in Wisconsin, Tennessee, Illinois and Louisiana.andP;  Itruns at a single resolution of 1,270 dpi when in PostScript mode, over a linemeasure of 12 inches.andP;  The price is $44,000 with 4 MB of memory in the RIPand a 50-MB disk.andP;  In native Alphatype mode, it sells for $25,000 with a '286processor or $28,000 with a '386.andP;  The package includes the code-orientedWorkstation software used for commercial typesetting applications.andM;Alphatype currently has no plans to offer the PostScript AlphaComposer tobroad markets as a standalone device.andP;  It is set up to sell it through itsexisting channels, primarily to customers with MultiSets or other Alphatypeequipment.andM;MultiVu and Novell systems.andP;  Alphatype reported that it has installed a fewNovell systems, including one of 12 terminals and another one of eight.andP;  Thenetworks support Alphatype's Workstation III software, which runs the fullAlphatype composition program using a code-based display, and the newWorkstation IV, which runs the composition program and adds a true-fontdisplay on a separate screen.andP;  Also supported are the full line of Alphatypetypesetters and two image scanners: the 300-dpi Datacopy unit and, the newestaddition, the 1,200-dpi Xerox 7650 gray-scale scanner.andM;Workstation IV, which consists of a PC running Alphatype's compositionsoftware and a high-resolution MultiVu preview screen, has added the abilityto import TIFF graphics as well as Xerox IMG format and EPSF files.andP;  Theworkstation can display and scale--but not crop--imported graphics.andM;The MultiVu is central to Alphatype's marketing strategy, which entailshaving survice bureaus that use MultiSet or Workstation IV systems supplytheir customers with the software and fonts necessary to preview fileslocally on the high-resolution screen.andP;  They can then request changes and geta new preview as desired, until the job is satisfactory.andP;  This basicWorkstation IV capability costs $16,500 to the service bureau, which can makewhatever deal it wants with its customers.andP;  It can rent, sell or givehardware and fonts to customers to support the program--and, hopefully, lockthe customers in.andM;One benefit Alphatype may get from this setup is additional font sales.andP;  Thepackage available to service bureaus' customers will include samples of theentire Alphatype font library, which the customers will be able to see ontheir screens.andP;  If a customer finds any it likes that the service bureaudoesn't have, it may ask the service bureau to purchase them.andM;A nice feature of this program is the ability to configure the typesetterfrom a remote location.andM;Alphatype sells the MultiVu/Novell system as a hardware/software packageonly.andP;  The package includes two 300-MB disks--one for the system and jobfiles, the other for fonts and graphics.andP;  Mirror writing to another 300-MBdisk is optional.andP;  Each '386 workstation comes with a 50-MB hard disk andsupports all composition functions.andP;  The MultiVu is optional.andP;  A sampleconfiguration comprising two Workstation III and two Workstation IV seatswould sell for about $69,000.andM;Spelling checker.andP;  Alphatype has added a spelling checker developed by thesame software team that did the MultiVu--Shore Technologies, of Chicago.andO;Called STIspell, after its developers, it runs in batch mode on theWorkstation III or IV, as well as under MS-DOS on any other '286 PC.andP;  Some ofits features are:andM;* A main dictionary, updatable by the user, with more than 135,000 words,plus an auxiliary dictionary function that can include contractions and wordswith ligatures.andM;* The ability to check words that are broken, such as by hyphens and carriagereturns or other user-defined characters.andM;* Display of suspected errors with suggested alternatives that can beinserted into the text either for one occurrence of the error or for alloccurrences within the file.andM;* The ability to print all flagged words in the file.andM;* Display, at the user's request, of the three lines of text that surroundany flagged word so the user can see the context in which the word resides.andM;MultiProof.andP;  Alphatype demonstrated support for the Canon BJ130 bubble-jetprinter based on ink-jet technology.andP;  It features a 48-nozzle head thatimages one direction only across an area 13-3/4 inches wide.andP;  The input trayholds 100 sheets of plain paper.andP;  Ink cartridges print approximately twomillion characters, or roughly 500 8-1/2&quot; X 11&quot; sheets.andP;  It prints at 100% or66% of actual size, in portrait or landscape mode, with automatic tiling ofjobs larger than the maximum size.andM;The BJ130 is driven directly from the MultiVu screen or from any workstationon the network at resolutions of 180 or 360 dpi, with an optional&quot;double-print&quot; 360-dpi mode to produce bolder output.andP;  (See samples.)andP;  If youwonder about the difference in resolution between the 120-dpi screen and theprinter, the answer is that the file is rerasterized in the MultiVu to drivethe printer at the selected resolution.andM;It prins text, graphics and rules generated by the RIP, using the same fontsthat are displayed on the MultiVu.andP;  It can be used to produce comprehensivesby printing headlines and greeking body text.andM;The output function ties up one workstation while the file is rasterized andspooled--either the workstation that sends the file or a dedicated outputserver.andM;The MultiProof can be run remotely at a customer's site.andM;The MultiProof costs $6,500, including the BJ130.andM;Font strategy.andP;  Alphatype's font strategy involves serving both the desktoppublishing and traditional publishing markets.andP;  It currently provides 35 fontthat are compatible in height and widths with the standard LaserWriter Plusfamily.andP;  The PSClone RIP used in Alphatype's PostScript typesetters nowaccepts Adobe Type 3 faces.andM;In addition, the 99000 and PS Composer can be run in either PostScript orAlphatype mode.andP;  In PostScript use, Alphatype fonts can be converted intoMacintosh screen fonts.andM;Finally, alphatype is modifying its PostScript interpreter to accept AdobeType 1 fonts.andM;Bedford shows PC versionandM;Throughout the year, Bedford has been porting software to the Macintosh andrefining it to make use of the Mac interface.andP;  Initially, the software was adirect conversion of the Bedford Meteor software.andP;  It was keyboard-orientedand didn't make use of Mac conventions.andP;  But that has gradually changed, andat Graph Expo, Bedford showed the Mac software in essentially finished form.andO;Bedford also showed a new version, for a '386-based PC.andP;  This product,currently as Meteor-like as the Mac one was initially, is just beginning itsevolution.andM;Bedford calls its Mac product &quot;ProType.&quot;andP;  It runs under A/UX (Apple's Unix),which means it must run on a separate disk (or at least a separate partitionof a large disk) from standard Macintosh applications.andP;  It needs a Mac withan 80-MB hard disk, 4 MB of RAM, and a SuperMac monochrome or color largemonitor.andM;ProType supports the same kind of high-quality commercial typography thatBedford products always have.andP;  It includes pair kerning, four levels oftracking, and aesthetic ragged controls.andP;  There is extensive support forforeign languages and for pi characters.andP;  Unlike previous Bedford systems, itsupports rotatation of text to any angle.andM;But the real break with Bedford tradition is the user interface, which is nowthoroughly Mac-oriented.andP;  The pulldown menus are handled in the usual Macfashion.andP;  It's a far cry from the Bedford interface, which, though it givesyou WYSIWYG feedback on the screen, still asks you to interact entirely viakeyboard commands.andM;Still, Bedford has not forgotten the value of keyboard coding for specialsituations, particularly when precision is called for or when flexibleformats must be developed for later reuse.andP;  Even though it isn't evident, themanipulations you do on the ProType screen are tracked in the form of Bedfordcodes in the background.andP;  Whenever you want to, you can open a window showingthese codes, and you can manipulate them from the keyboard in the traditionalmanner.andM;The latest ProType features at the show included typical Macintosh keyboardshortcuts for menu items (such as command-I for italic type and command-B forbold), a &quot;format on the fly&quot; feature that captures keyboard and mouseactivities for reuse later, and a four-up signature imposition routine.andO;There are also improved tools for creating irregular runarounds.andM;ProType options include translators for TIFF and EPS files, an automaticbatch pagination routine, a package for complex math (always a Bedfordstrength), and a package of text-file conversion tools.andM;The basic ProType package costs $3,995.andP;  Bought separately, math costs$7,000, image support costs $4,000, batch pagination costs $5,000, and thetext-file conversion tools cost $3,000.andP;  But Bedford offers discounts oncombinations.andP;  For example, ProType with math and image support costs $11,995(vs.andP;  $14,995 for the individual parts).andM;DOS PCs have been the platform of choice for commercial-quality typesettingsoftware up to now (Bestinfo, Magna, and Ultimate the examples of this).andO;With ProType, Bedford becomes one of the initial group of vendors movingMacintosh typography to the next level beyond PageMaker and Xpress.andM;We expect Lightspeed's new software to put it in this group, and Letraset'sDesignStudio may end up there as well.andP;  But of the three, only Bedford has along tradition of commercial typesetting systems, and it is the only oneoffering batch pagination and math support.andP;  This group of vendors, andothers that join it, may well shift the balance of quality typographicsoftware in favor of the Macintosh.andM;The PC port.andP;  Bedford's PC product, next in line for development, was shownrunning on an NEC '386 platform, using SCO Xenix.andP;  Initially, it is availableonly as part of a network containing Bedford's Sun or proprietary Targetworkstations.andP;  At this point it has a totally keyboard-oriented interface,but Bedford plans to move to an X Window interface once the necessarydevelopment tools become available (they are expected around the end of theyear).andP;  Bedford reports orders for 18 of the PC-based units so far.andM;Bedford has gradually added graphics support to its products and now supportsmost varieties of graphics except full-resolution contone color.andP;  It doessupport color at screen resolution (for position), and it has developed aCrosfield interface for the addition of full-resolution color.andP;  The Crosfieldinterface is in production at Batten Graphics.andP;  A similar facility for Scitexis under development, and Hell will follow.andM;Betting on Unix.andP;  Bedford, as it has from the start, continues to place itsbets on Unix.andP;  For the Mac, this means A/UX; for the PC, Xenix with the &quot;XWindow&quot; user interface.andM;Sticking with Unix has made some aspects of Bedford's software conversioneasier, but others harder, than the alternatives.andP;  It was evidentlyrelatively easy to get the Meteor software to run in the A/UX environment,but adjusting the user interface to Mac expectations and handling thenecessary file conversions and interfacing to use the standard Mac fileformats and peripherals was hard because Apple has not put much energy intodeveloping A/UX.andP;  Bedford had to write utility software that Apple wouldprobably have supplied if it were really serious about A/UX as a developmentenvironment.andM;In a similar vein, working with Xenix on the PC means doing without manyutilities that are readily available under DOS, and full support fordeveloping X Window applications is only just becoming available.andP;  So itremains to be seen whether Bedford's Unix approach will return the hoped-fordividends.andP;  But Bedford has managed to provide a package that runs in amultitasking environment on the Mac, which is something the other MAcpackages can't do.andP;  And Bedford's Xenix/X Window product may well be readybefore the OS-2/Presentation Manager combination spawns any real products.andM;Bestinfo competes in colorandM;Graph Expo gave us an opportunity to explore the color separation facilitiesof Bestinfo's Wave4 system in greater depth than we had before.andP;  There's alot to report: Bestinfo has evidently taken color as seriously as it hastypography, and as a consequence it has developed a system that can competein either area (text or color) with systems developed specifically for thatarea alone.andM;Bestinfo's color software works with PostScript imagesetters.andP;  It does not,however, use PostScript halftoning.andP;  Bestinfo recgonized early on that therewere problems with PostScript halftoning, so it developed an output methodthat creates the halftone dots in the PC, rather than in the output recorder.andO;They are sent, in compressed form, to the PostScript imagesetter.andP;  (Inaddition to avoiding the idiosyncracies of PostScript halftoning, this methodincreases output speed.)andM;For input, Bestinfo supports only the Eikonix vertical camera for color work.andO;(Xerox and ECRM scanners are supported for monochrome.)andP;  Bestinfo isinvestigating other color scanners for the future, however, and it ispossible to take in images from any scanner that can provide a Targa-formatfile.andP;  Though its displays handle only 16-bit color, Bestinfo supports both16-bit and 32-bit color images internally.andP;  (Monochrome contones, which arealways 8 bits deep, are supported too.)andP;  Unlike text files, which alwaysreside on file servers, scanned images are often stored on the disk of thescanning station: they often contain tens of megabytes of data, so movingthem elsewhere would bog the network down.andP;  Low-resolution view files, whichare much smaller, move freely.andM;The color separation software is controlled through an extensive series ofmenus.andP;  One group is used for setting up separation parameters--such as dotshape, contouring (i.e., changing dot shape to emphasize edges), UCR and GCRcontrols, screen angles and ruling, and resolution of the output device.andO;There is also an adustment for press dot gain and one for ink colorimperfections.andP;  Incidentally, Bestinfo's dot contouring facility depends onthe company's non-PostScript approach to halftoning.andP;  Dot shapes inPostScript halftones can't be varied according to their surroundings.andM;Actual scanning is done using &quot;ImageWright,&quot; a Wave4 module.andP;  The first stepis to calibrate the scanner, using a white card (or a white backlight, if atransparency is to be scanned).andP;  Then the user makes a &quot;view&quot; scan, a quickscreen-resolution scan that is used to check focus, cropping and scaling.andM;It also permits adjustment of other scanning parameters.andP;  Adjustments can bemade in split-screen mode, with the original scan on the left and theadjusted version on the right.andP;  Like other color vendors, Bestinfo does notclaim that the screen shows accurate color as it will print, but thesplit-screen view does show the direction and magnitude of any changes.andM;A variety of adjustments are possible.andP;  Histograms show where in the tonalscale the image pixels fall.andP;  Highlight and shadow points can be selected,indicating which elements in the image will print with the minimum(highlighs) and maximum (shadow) dot.andP;  The operator can adjust the tonalcurves in such a way that tonal range compression takes place with the leastloss of useful picture information.andP;  (Some compression is usually necessary,since photographic images often have a wider tonal range than the printingprocess can reproduce.)andP;  Alternatively, a less sophisticated operator cansimply work with brightness and contrast controls.andM;There are individual controls of overall red, green and blue, or cyan, yellowand magenta.andP;  These would be used to remove a color cast.andP;  There is also acontrol for increasing or decreasing the overall color saturation.andP;  A digitalsharpening control increases the contrast at edges in the image.andM;Color images can be converted to black-and-white or duotone, and the operatorcan control the contributions of red, green and blue components to emphasizeareas in the image.andM;A queuing facility lets color adjustments be applied to the full-resolutionimage in the background on the network output workstation.andP;  Color settingsused for one job can be saved and recalled for use with another, similar joblater.andP;  Eventually, images will have a picture job ticket, similar to the oneused with text files on the Bestinfo system.andP;  This facility has not beenimplemented yet: Bestinfo is still determining what the ticket shouldcontain.andM;For image editing, Bestinfo supports Tips.andP;  Masks can be constructed, eitherby selecting a specific tonal range or via the drawing tools, and used tomanipulate selected image areas and to combine images.andP;  Large images areoften bigger than the Tips image buffer, so they must be worked on in smallertiles.andP;  On an overall view, the operator can select an image area for work.andO;The selected point will then become the center of the current tile.andM;Other image-editing packages can be used, as long as the Targa file format issupported.andP;  Some Bestinfo sites have used Rio or Lumena, for example.andM;Pages are assembled in Color PageWright.andP;  Text and monochrome line art fromPageWrite and color images from ImageWright can be brought in.andP;  Graphicobjects (rules, borders, geometric shapes and the like) can be assignedcolors from a palette, via typed CMYK percentages, or by selecting a colorout of an image.andP;  (Text can be colored too, without being converted to lineart; it remains editable at any text terminal.)andP;  The required amounts ofchoke and spread can be specified.andP;  Images can be placed, cropped, sized androtated.andM;Color EPS files from Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw can also be placed onthe page, but they will be displayed as monochrome.andP;  (On output they will becolor, of course.)andP;  Since they are not converted to Bestinfo format, it isnot possible to introduce chokes and spreads to these files.andM;For proofing, Bestinfo supports color PostScript devices, such as those fromQMS and Tektronix.andP;  Proofs from these machines can be used as a substitutefor comprehensive layouts, but it is difficult to get accurate color fromthem.andP;  To produce a more sophisticated proof, Bestinfo is developing aninterface to the Iris ink-jet proofer.andM;Bestinfo has an image library option, which allows the storage and retrievalof images, logos and custom color palettes.andP;  There is also a &quot;color table&quot;facility, which allows the storing of up to 485 standard colors that can berecalled by number.andP;  This can be thought of as a kind of &quot;make your ownPantone&quot; capability.andM;While it provides a strong color capability, Bestinfo recognizes that someusers who might like Bestinfo's text facilities are not ready to do their owncolor.andP;  For them, the company offers text systems with interfaces to high-endcolor systems.andP;  One way of getting into the high-end systems is simply viaPostScript output files, which all the color vendors can now accept.andP;  ForScitex, there are two additional options: Handshake and Visionary STIL.andM;We were impressed with the comprehensiveness of Bestinfo's color facilities.andO;We particularly like the fact that you can setter.andP;

 There the made-up pages arecombined with graphics from online scanners and output to the Autologic PIPas full pages.andP;  At the first customer site, the configuration includes anAtex composition system, PostScript and Autologic RIPs, and Autokon and ItekColour Graphix scanners.andM;CSE's role includes not only providing layout capabilities in its customaryfashion, but also assisting in precise placement of graphics.andP;  PageSpec,which issues graphics calls to acces the scanned images from the AGI, canplace them with greater accuracy than some scanners or composition programs.andO;CSE sites the Autokon as an example.andM;In using the CSE program, the scanner is set up to produce an image slightlylarger than the space assigned on the page, which enables CSE to crop it tothe exact size required.andP;  CSE also performs trapping of images to compensatefor slight variations in registration of printing plates.andP;  It achieves asimilar result with rules used as borders around photographs by specifyingthat part of each rule overlap the graphic object adjacent to it.andM;CSE sends cropping instructions to the Autologic PIP, where the croppingtakes place.andP;  Other functions served by CSE include sending tint values tothe PIP as CMYK values, reversing type on an area basis and rotating elementsin 90-degree increments.andP;  Not yet completed is a project to send a view fileback to PageSpec from the AGI.andP;  This capability has been in Autologic's planssince the AGI was introduced, but it hasn't been completed yet.andM;Mac PageSpec.andP;  In another corner of the Autologic booth, CSE showed a previewof a version of its PageSpec layout program for the Macintosh.andP;  The intentionis to provide facilities for designing layouts, with emphasis on theprecision that often isn't available with other Macintosh programs.andP;  Forexample, PageSpec provides comprehensive means of aligning elements.andP;  If anelement is being placed with respect to multiple columns of text, it can besnapped to the far end of one column of text, to the middle of the gutterbetween the two columns or to the near end of the next column.andP;  Alignment totext can be based on the baseline or the cap height of the text line.andM;PageSpec also has nice features for restricting or controlling the movementof elements--anchoring corners of the center, restricting movement to eitherthe horizontal or the vertical direction, and so on.andM;Text will be displayable using Bitstream Fontware technology.andP;  By March, CSEhopes to be able also to diplay TIFF and EPSF graphics.andM;When the product is finished, it will be possible to create a design of theMacintosh, turn it over to a PC system for production, and go back to the Macfor modifications as desired, CSE said.andP;  The initial release is scheduled forJanuary.andM;Dewar shows Advanced GraphicsandM;Dewar, the newspaper system vendor that expanded into the commercial markettwo years ago, has sold systems to about 20 commercial customers in thattime.andP;  We were interested to learn that Dewar believes that the commercialmarket is now driving its development effort harder than the newspapermarket.andP;  The explanation for this circumstance includes the strongcompetitive nature of the commercial market, which forces customers toupgrade their systems to keep up with their competitors, and their abilityand willingness to make financial commitments to improve their equipment.andM;With this in mind, Dewar has been working on integrating off-the-shelfgraphics programs into its system.andP;  The two products being demonstrateD,which are in beta testing at Shepard Poorman in Indianapolic, were Corel Drawand Astral Picture Publisher.andP;  Graphics from these programs can be broughtinto the Discovery display ad system, placed on a page, sized, cropped,reversed, flipped, masked and anamorphically distorted.andP;  A drawing also canbe used as a background for creating an ad layout.andP;  Text and rules can alsobe added.andM;Dewar was demonstrating Corel Draw's ability to modify type, by fitting it toa curved path, inside or outside a circle, and so on, with kerning availableafter characters are placed.andP;  Corel produces a 300-dpi file that Dewarconverts to the appropriate resolution for the target output device.andM;The graphics database provides the standard dBase functions for storing andsearching.andP;  (As we have reported, Dewar uses dBase as the database languagefor its system.)andM;Dewar now offers three levels of capabilities with Discovery: (1) the basicdisplay ad program; (2) Discovery with Basic Graphics, including the graphicsdatabase and the ability to crop and size graphics; and (3) the AdvancedGraphics program, which imports contones and created graphics, as shown inChicago.andM;Intergraph enters color fieldandM;This was Intergraph's first appearance at Graph Expo, and it was anauspicious debut.andP;  The sales force manning the large booth may have beengreen, but they had reason to smile--Intergraph's first commercial systemsale, announced at the show, is a $5-$7 million contract with TV Guide (seeVol.andP;  19, No.andP;  4, p. 27).andM;More such contracts may come.andP;  Lani Hajagos, a key planner for Intergraph'selectronic publishing group, was a cofounder of EIT, which specialized indatabase publishing systems for yellow page and TV listings.andP;  Her experienceproved invaluable in winning the TV Guide contract.andM;But this was also the show at which Intergraph announced its intention to bea serious player in the color prepress market.andP;  It plans to supply completesystem solutions that handle everything from text and image input to creationof final films.andP;  New at the show were a 400-dpi color scanner (covered in thenext section) and color manipulation software.andM;Going from imaging to print.andP;  Intergraph's Distributed Publishing (DP)product family supports color in several ways.andP;  DP/Publisher provides spotcolor separations; DP/Paint provides low-resolution raster image editing; andDP/Presenter provides vector-based color presentations that may be imaged toscreen, printer or film recorder at selectable resolutions.andP;  At Graph Expo,Intergraph introduced I/Image, a high-resolution color image manipulationprogram.andP;  Developed initially for Intergraph's industrial design andpackaging customers, I/Image is Intergaph's flagship product for imageprocessing.andP;  Now, Intergraph wants to give the program the touches necessaryfor graphic arts applications.andM;I/Image is ideal for users who want to create visuals for print usinggraphics in a CAD or CAE database, because the program offers a combinationof vector and raster tools and has interfaces to Intergraph's extensivefamily of graphics software.andP;  For example, at the show, Intergraphdemonstrated how a ray tracing done on tubes of toothpaste, taken from agraphics database, formed the foundation for a new image that becameadvertisement artwork.andP;  The toothpaste tubes were copied, rotated, edited andmanipulated in various degrees until ready for output.andP;  The final image couldthen be sent to a color printer, video device or film recorder like theColorSetter to make a new transparency.andM;The program supports up to 2,048 separate layers, half vector and halfraster.andP;  Its interface is a combination of menus, icons and palettes, withkeyboard commands offered as an alternative for most operations.andP;  It runs onIntergraph's Clipper-based workstations, but it takes a hefty dose of RAM.andO;The demo unit on the show floor had 48 MB, and 16 MB is considered theminimum.andM;I/Image has more vector tools than most graphic arts applications.andP;  Theability to build models using wireframe arcs and shapes derived from athree-dimensional database, for example, is just now starting to appear inthe industry.andP;  (Shima also showed the use of wireframes at Graph Expo.)andP;  Ofcourse, the usual collection of graphics primitives are offered, with floodfill and vignettes offered for any shape.andM;I/Image has extensive shading options.andP;  The software lets the user specifyindependent red, green or blue values, or a range of values, and then changethe color of pixels that fall within that range.andP;  Not only can you change onecolor to another, you can also bump one color up or down in numerical values.andO;For example, we changed the color of a toothbrush that was dipped in water byadding 20 to all green values within a certain range.andP;  This made all of thetoothbrush change color uniformly, even the part that was shaded darkerbecause it was under water.andP;  Because we could make the transformations on aselected value range within a selected portion of the image, we didn't affectother parts of the image.andM;The raster tools are not yet as sophisticated as those of top-of-the-linecolor retouching systems, but Intergraph has made a reasonable first stab atdelivering a functional product.andP;  The painting and masking tools of I/Imagework with either gray-scale or color images.andP;  Neither set of tools isparticularly noteworthy yet, but they do provide a reasonable foundation onwhich Intergraph can build.andM;The text facilities, as you might expect, are better than those of most colorsystems.andP;  Intergraph is bundling 96 Bitstream scalable outline fonts withI/Image.andP;  You can independently control the horizontal and vertical set ofeach character, kern on the screen in 1/100-point increments or percentagesof an em, adjust baselines, rotate freely and edit the text itself, evenafter it is part of the image.andP;  Of course, you can also color text.andM;To make color selection a little easier, Intergraph also announced alicensing agreement with Pantone through which it will offer Pantone's systemof matching colors in the Intergraph Pantone Color Interface.andP;  The interfacewill be available on all Intergraph RISC-based workstations by the end of theyear.andP;  I/Image will be the first application to support it.andM;I/Image will be available later this year (pricing to be announced).andM;Until now, Intergraph really hasn't been taken seriously in the commercialcomposition or graphic arts color markets.andP;  But its contract with TV Guide,coupled with a strong show debut and the launch of a dedicated sales force,had heads turning at Graph Expo.andP;  Steadily, the company is establishing oneof the most complete graphic artx prepress systems available.andP;  Havingsucceeded with text, it is turning its attention to what it knowsbest--graphics--and adding input and output peripherals as it moves along.andM;Intergraph may be a darkhorse in this market, but it is running ever closerto the pack.andM;Miles 33 making progressandM;We reported on Miles's recent progress at the Seybold Conference (see Vol.andO;19, No.andP;  4, p. 11), so we did not really expect any changes at Graph Expo, amonth later.andP;  But Miles had added two new wrinkles in the interim.andM;One is a new way of handling image placement and cropping.andP;  The operator canplace a frame of a precise size on the page, then bring in the image at aspecified magnification.andP;  If the image is larger than the frame, only thepart inside the frame will be visible, but the image can be moved around&quot;behind&quot; the frame, using the mouse, until the desired portion is visible.andO;Then the image can be locked in position.andM;The second enhancement is a better way of handling stories that overflowtheir assigned columns.andP;  The overset matter previously continued down off thebottom of the page.andP;  That worked fine if the column ended at the bottom ofthe page.andP;  But if there were other items lower on the page, they could beobscured by the overset matter.andP;  In the new implementation, the story stopsat the bottom of the column, and the overset (if any) jumps to the bottommargin of the page.andP;  From there it continues downward as before.andM;Multi-Ad out with second releaseandM;The latest status of Multi-Ad Creator's key software upgrade is that it willbe shipped to regular customers by the end of November.andP;  This release (2.0),which will be covered in our upcoming review of the display ad product forthe Macintosh, includes enhancements to both text and graphics capabilities.andM;For text, Creator 2.0 provides style sheets with the ability to define textattributes at the character and paragraph levels.andP;  It also offers &quot;composefrom model&quot; capabilities.andP;  For the first time, automatic hyphenation isprovided, with reasonable controls over the quality (number of charactersthat must precede and follow a hyphen, size of hyphenatable word and numberof consecutive lines that may be hyphenated).andP;  The interword spacing targetis specified as a percentage of the default--an implementation that has to betested extensively before it can be judged for quality.andM;Also new are a thersaurus from Microlytics and an interactive spellingchecker that will lean new words and replace flagged items with suggestedalternatives.andP;  Another nice addition is a global font change facility.andM;A copyfitting routine appears to have been implemented nicely.andP;  It enables aline of text to be sized to fit within a fixed horizontal space, either bymaintaining the point size and expanding or condensing the characters or bymaintaining the true character proportions and changing the point size asmuch as needed.andM;New graphics features include an algorithm for smoothing curves, a &quot;makematrix&quot; command for dividing an area into boxes, the ability to add color toimported graphics, improved color separation capabilities by adding UCR andGCR, and separation of 32-bit color images.andM;With this release, Creator becomes an even stronger contender in a greatlycompetitive market.andP;  Multi-Ad Services says it has sold about 1,200 packagessince the product was released in March.andP;  Creator's $995 price includes ayear of both free upgrades and free technical support.andM;Penta embraces the desktopandM;Penta had the new entry-level system it introduced the month before at theComputer Publishing Conference, but at Graph Expo it showed a new twist:running both a PC and Data General network off the same file server.andP;  Thissetup allows systems running on PC networks and Penta software to run off thesame hardware, which works nicely with applications such as its newPostScript filter, developed by Shaffstall.andM;PageMaker/Penta side-by-side.andP;  Using Data General's PC interface, Penta hasbeen able to run PCs off a DG file server for well over a year.andP;  During thattime, the company has gradually migrated nearly all of its software ontoMS-DOS running under Microsoft Windows.andP;  Penta now has its editor, graphicspackage, magazine layout and batch pagination all running on the PC.andP;  Theonly key piece left to port is the basic handamp;j, which the company says it hopesto complete next year.andM;In the meantime, Penta's commercial customers need to be able to offerservices to desktop publishers as well as their traditional Penta-basedcomposition.andP;  Many existing customers are buying PCs additional Pentaterminals and have already purchased PostScript imagesetters.andP;  The questionis how to make use this equipment in a mixed environment, rather than set upseparate operations.andM;Data General has introduced software that enables Penta to create an MS-DOSpartition on the Data General file server.andP;  As shown at Graph Expo, thisenables Penta to run two networks over the same Ethernet wiring and, moreimportant, it makes it possible to log into both networks (though obviouslynot simultaneously) from one workstation.andP;  The system administratorestablishes two batch files for booting the PC.andP;  If the job at hand calls forworking in Ventura or PageMaker, the user logs into Novell.andP;  If the next jobis to be done on the Penta system, the user reboots using the Penta loginbatch file.andM;We have been running dual networks in our offices for some time.andP;  Whilerebooting is a nuisance, it certainly beats buying duplicate PCs.andP;  (And with'386-based PCs becoming more common, the reboot times are droppingdramatically.)andP;  Thus, we believe Penta's offering is attractive to customersthat want to run a mixed-system shop.andM;Penta is the first vendor to openly offer such capability (dual systems canbe set up similarly using any of the PC-based systems that support Novell).andO;This move signals the company's recognition that it must coexist with desktoppublishing rather than try to distance itself from the desktop market.andM;This strategy was further exemplified in Penta's demonstration of the newShaffstall PostScript translator.andP;  The program will convert a PostScriptoutput file from PageMaker, Quark Xpress or Ventura in two ways.andP;  The firstway is to recompose the file on the Penta system.andP;  The PostScript commandsare interpreted and translated to corresponding Penta commands, creating aPenta composition file that may be edited, composed and paginated the same asany other Penta file.andP;  This conversion would be useful if the servicebureau's customer wants something better than he can get through PageMaker orVentura--such as hung punctuation, foreign language hyphenation or simplybetter handamp;j and pagination.andM;The second method translates the PostScript file into a Penta file, but itinserts a force-justify command at the end of every line, thereby preservingthe line breaks of the original file.andP;  One interesting application of thistechnology would be outputting PageMaker or Ventura files on a typesetter innative mode (Cora, Autologic or any other that Penta drives), rather thanusing a PostScript imagesetter.andM;Penta reports that three of its customers already have &quot;PS Filter,&quot; as thetranslator is called.andP;  Unlike Shaffstall, which is selling the program onlyin conjunction with its media conversion system, Penta is selling just thesoftware, which runs under MS-DOS.andP;  However, no firm pricing for the producthas been established.andM;Synaptic ties the knot with EPIandM;The main news from Synaptic wasn't related to equipment on display: themerger with The Electronic Publisher, Inc.andP;  We covered this announcement inour last issue, although it took place at the time of Graph Expo and thebooth included news about the products now housed under one roof.andM;Ultimate supports masking, MacandM;Ultimate Technographics introduced a Macintosh version of its Poststripprogram and a Postmask product for the PC.andM;Mac Poststrip, which is scheduled to be available next February, provides thesame functionality as the PC product.andP;  That is, it takes PostScript files andarranges them in proper imposition for a press and outputs them to ahigh-resolution recorder to be imaged on film or RC paper.andP;  It takes intoaccount gripper margins for the press, lap margin of the collator, thicknessof the paper when it is folded, and so on.andP;  The user can view the imposedpages on the screen or on a laser printer prior to committing them tohigh-resolution film.andM;Ultimate says the response to its first version of Poststrip has been good.andO;The company reports that it supports input from systems by Penta, Xyvision,Magna, Bestinfo and Ultimate, with Miles 33 to follow.andP;  Pricing depends onthe exact applications purchased: a single desktop publishing application,such as PageMaker or Ventura Publisher, $4,000; three desktop applications,$10,000; for all applications, such as might be needed by a service bureau,$20,000; for Penta, Xyvision, Magna, Bestinfo or Miles systems, $9,000 each;and for Ultimate, $7,000.andM;Postmask.andP;  Another new addition to this family of products is the maskingprogram called Postmask.andP;  Running in a PC with a VGA monitor, it providesfacilities for masking graphics for spot-color assignments on PostScriptpages.andP;  It uses the Eicon PostScript interpreter board to generate a previewof pages on the screen.andP;  Input can be data files from a variety of PostScriptcomposition programs or pages that have been scanned.andM;The operator is given a variety of tools for creating masks at the desiredlocations, using geometric shapes such as circles, rectangles and polygons.andO;Freehand outlining with a mouse will be available also, as will the abilityto cut and paste objects between programs, which would be useful when twoprograms are incompatible.andM;Postmask, which works on single pages at a time, outputs pages as multiplepieces of film--one for each color--to a PostScript recorder.andP;  Postmask canbe used in conjunction with Ultimate's Poststrip product.andM;Pricing is expected to be in the range of $10,000, including the Eicon cardthat generates the PostScript page on the screen.andP;  First deliveries weretargeted for this month.andM;One market for this product will be users with special applications--such asmerging of elements from two incompatible programs--since the masking,assignment of spot colors and output of multiple pieces of film are alreadysupported on a lot of programs, both at the desktop level and amonghigher-end composition systems.andP;  Other special situations that would benefitfrom Postmask's facilities might be reassigning colors when they weren't donecorrectly in desktop programs.andP;  We could see masking and assigning more thanone color to an object in PageMaker that was brought in as a single plane andcan't be split into two planes to support two colors.andP;  It is also likely thatsome printers will be more comfortable with this masking than with usingdesktop publishing programs.andM;Graphic SubsystemsandM;ECRM and ImagiTex dominate the market for high-resolution monochrome scannersand graphic subsystems, and both had booths at Graph Expo.andP;  However, we havecovered their new products in our last two issues.andP;  At Graph Expo, we heardfrom the newcomers.andM;Du Pont highlights Linotype pactandM;Du Pont announced a marketing agreement with Linotype through which it willoffer Linotronic imagesetters with PostScript RIPs as part of the Du PontHighlight system.andM;The Highlight is an ImagiTex scanner with ImagiTex's image processingsoftware put onto specialized hardware driving a Linotronic 300 or 500 innavite mode for creating screened halftones.andP;  Highlight is marketed as areplacement for cameras and a direct competitor to Fuji and ECRM--ImageTex'simage editing software is not offered, nor are there any announced plans inthis direction.andM;Highlight is an expensive system, partly because of the cost of theimagesetter.andP;  The new agreement makes the package more palatable because thecustomer will be able to use the Highlight imagesetter for output ofPostScript files.andM;As part of the agreement, Linotype will be able to market the Highlightsystem in conjunction with an L500.andP;  Du Pont will service all of the systemexcept the RIP, which will be serviced by Linotype personnel, although DuPont will act as the prime contact for all service calls.andM;Fuji adds SCSI interfaceandM;ScanArt 30II.andP;  Fuji's ScanArt 30 has become a serious competitor to the ECRMAutokon and the ImageTex 3000.andP;  Its monochrome scanner offers noteworthyoptions--an input stacker with which up to 40 jobs are loaded and run withoutoperator intervention and an attachment for scanning color transparencies.andO;It also operates in full daylight without the need for darkroom processing.andO;Fuji says it has sold more than 60 units so far in the U.S.andM;Several sharpness filters, sizing from 20% to 300% in single-degreeincrements and special-effect filters and screens are standard features.andO;Fuji also cites the quality (up to 2,500 dpi on input) of the machine as akey selling point.andP;  It is a production-only machine that generates screenedfilms at 1,129 lpi directly from the scan; no tools for image editing areoffered at this time.andP;  The ScanArt 30II uses two lasers--one helieum-neon andone argon-ion--which enables it to provide scans of color originals that Fujiclaims are superior to those of single-laser systems.andM;But the first step toward hooking up the ScanArt 30 to other devices wasintroduced in the form of a SCSI interface between a PC and the ScanArt 30II.andO;The interface package (which includes PC plug-in board and hard disk), inconjunction with software running on the PC, takes the scanned data, pipes itto the PC and converts it to TIFF.andM;Fuji showed a Mac connected to the PC, but that was only to demonstrate howfiles could be passed from a PC to a Mac; there are no current plans for adirect Mac SCSI interface.andP;  However, Fuji did say that it expects to offerEthernet and DDES support in the near future.andM;The SCSI interface for the ScanArt 30II will be available in early 1990.andP;  Itspricing has not been established.andM;Fuji's American subsidiary announced that its graphic arts division has beenrenamed the Graphic Systems Division to reflect the merger of Fuji's colorcopier and reprographic products into the graphic arts division.andM;Conversion SystemsandM;Shafftstall translates PostScriptandM;Shaffstall, in its first show appearance since its buy-out from Penta,featured its PostScript conversion software at Graph Expo.andP;  The software isdesigned to help people with existing non-PostScript typesetting systems whowant to take in PostScript files.andP;  In particular, it is a way for commercialtypesetting services and in-house typesetting operations to piggyback ondesktop publishing activities.andM;If you own a typesetting system, there are two approaches you might want totake to typesetting PostScript on a non-PostScript system.andP;  On the one hand,you might want to run the file out matching line for line the composed linesof the PostScript file.andP;  Though your system wouldn't change line endings, itwould be able to handle kerning, tracking and other such formatting withineach line.andP;  Alternatively, you might want to capture the PostScript text asparagraphs that could be your system.andP;  This gives you better control overhandamp;j, but it might result in line endings and paragraph lengths different fromthose in the original PostScript file.andM;Shaffstall provides the tools to take either approach in its PS Interpreterpackage.andP;  The &quot;page image&quot; option puts a &quot;force justify&quot; command at the endof each justified line of PostScript, and it puts a quadding command at theend of each line in ragged copy.andP;  Leading commands ensure that the originalline-spacing is retained.andM;Alternatively, the &quot;galley&quot; option collects the PostScript text into aconinuous file, with line-endings disregarded.andP;  Although there is nothing ina PostScript file to explicitly indicate the end of a paragraph, PSInterpreter tries to identify paragraphs via clues such as short last linesand indents on initial lines.andP;  It puts a return or quad command at eachsuspected paragraph end.andM;PS Interpreter will handle text and rules that are horizontal or vertical.andO;It throws out the rest of the PostScript file.andP;  It can produce output that iscorrectly coded for use on systems from the following vendors:  Alphatype,Bedford, CCI, Compugraphic, Datalogics, Linotype, Magna, Miles 33, Penta,Varityper, Xerox and Xyvision, with others to come.andP;  It can handle PostScriptfiles generated by Aldus PageMaker (Mac and PC), Ventura Publisher, QuarkXpress, ReadySetGo and WordPerfect 5.0.andM;The conversion of a sample file, the Ventura &quot;Scoop&quot; document, took aboutfour minutes.andP;  The source file occupies about 152 KB on disk.andM;PS Interpreter is a $2,995 option to the Shaffstall 6000 Media Converter.andP;  Itis also available as a standalone program to run on an IBM-compatible PC; inthat form it costs $5,995 and requires a '286 or '386 PC with 640K of RAM anda hard disk.andP;  On-site training is included in both versions.andM;Input/Output DevicesandM;Although most of the major vendors of output devices were present, there wasless news in this area than might be expected.andP;  Most of these companies hadmade major announcements at the Computer Publishing Conference two monthsearlier, so there hadn't been time to come up with much new.andM;There were a few new items, though: more configurations from Autologic (whichwe covered in some detail from IFRA in our last issue), a PC RIP From Hyphen,U.S.andP;  introductions of products from the European vendors Purup and DISC(which are covered under color systems), a 300-dpi printer from Linotype anda polyester plate material from Mitsubishi.andP;  Alphatype's PostScript devicesappear on page 26.andM;Autologic restructures output lineupandM;In reporting from IFRA in our last issue, we mentioned some of the changesAutologic has made in an effort to make more rational its line of outputdevices.andP;  The changes involve memory and disk configurations in its PageImage Processors and capabilities of its ECRM PelBox recorders.andP;  Some of thenews was announced at both shows.andP;  Much of it was only at Graph Expo.andP;  Herewe will summarize the entire situation, including some sample U.S.andP;  pricing.andM;Besides the new output lineup, also new were some commands for the GICLlanguage and enhancements to the Autologic Graphics Integrator (AGI), whichtakes and stores input in a variety of formats, merges it with input fromother sources and sends it to a PIP for processing.andM;Another new development is an online processing transport system from Pako,which sells for $31,995.andM;The 250S Page Image Processors.andP;  Autologic already had a diskless APS-250PIP, but there are now several models to cover various output formats.andM;* Where the former 250 had 4 MB of memory, the entry-level APS-250S now has12 MB, which accommodates an 8-1/2&quot; X 11&quot; page.andM;* The 250SE (for expanded) has an extra 12 MB, for a total of 24 MB, eitherto hold an 11&quot; x 17&quot; page or to overlap the processing of two 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot;pages.andP;  The SE has no through-put accelerator.andM;* The 250SR has 24 MB of memory more than the SE, or 48 MB all together,which can either overlap the building and recording of two consecutive 11&quot; x17&quot; pages or build broadsheet newspaper pages, one at a time.andM;The 250S family of PIPs, which can drive any Autologic recorders, come withdual ports to support two imagers.andM;The APS-6/70S imager.andP;  At both IFRA and Graph Expo, Autologic demonstrated anew member of the APS-6 family, the 70S (a 70-pica PelBox), running in avariety of modes:andM;* 10&quot; per minute at 1,016 x 1,016 resolution in ICL or PostScript mode.andM;* 5&quot; per minute at 2,032 x 2,032 in PostScript mode only.andM;* We expect to see another version running at 7.5&quot; per minute at a resolutionof 1,446 x 1,446 or 12.5&quot; per minute at 723 x 723.andM;This is a different machine from the existing APS/70, which will continue tobe offered.andM;As we reported from IFRA, Autologic has combined the new 70S recorder withthe 250S PIP to form an APS-Micro6, which will cost $52,500 in the U.S.andO;(Pricing will vary from country to country).andM;APS-6/500 family.andP;  In a manner similar to the 250S, Autologic isrationalizing its 500 PIP.andP;  In this case, some of the model variations relateto disk sizes and some to memory.andM;* The 500 PIP has a single 86-MB Winchester disk for page memory.andM;* The 500D has a second 86-MB disk, making it equivalent to the currentAPS-800 PIP.andM;* The 500R replaces both 86-MB disks with 48 MB of dynamic RAM.andM;* The 500S replaces both 86-MB disks with 96 MB of memory, making itequivalent to a current 800S.andM;An APS-6/500 with one 86-MB disk and an APS-6/70 imager sells for $69,500 inthe U.S.andP;  The R option adds $12,000 in the U.S.andP;  (pricing varies by country).andM;Color separations.andP;  Announced at both shows was the modification of a108-pica PelBox to output color separation film with accuracy.andP;  Themodifications to the 1,016 x 1,016-resolution machine included bettercharacter laydown and a motorized cassette.andP;  The speed is the same as thestandard 108S: 24 inches per minute.andM;New GICL commands.andP;  Autologic continues to add to the capabilities supportedby its GICL language.andP;  The latest additions are bevel shadows, transformationmatrixes, better means of handling text attributes (outline text, fills,etc.), starbursts and several ways of creating coupon rules.andM;These capabilities already are available to vendors of front-end systems;some have been implemented by Harris.andM;AGI developments.andP;  Autologic reported installing four AGI systems and selling12 more, with the average price being about $55,000, equivalent to an AGIwith 1.2 GB of disk storage.andP;  The standard configuration, which sells for$35,000, has one 344-MB disk and a 150-MB tape cartridge, although the tapeunit capacity will be increased to 2.2 GB.andM;Autologic has made it easier for front-ent systems to call for graphics bydedicating an unused font call to graphics.andP;  When the system requests thisfont followed by the name of a graphic, the AGI accesses it.andP;  This is howcolor is being handled.andM;We asked when Autologic would be able to send view files back to thefront-end system from the AGI and were told that in the near term the AGIwould be able to send a TIFF file back for previewing.andP;  Users can alreadytake in a TIFF file, such as from an Autokon scanner, and sent it back to aMacintosh for manipulation using programs such as ImageStudio or ColorStudio,after which it is returned to the AGI.andP;  Other features already supported arethe cropping and sizing of images in the AGI, which is under way at the keyinstallation at MillerFreeman, where 22 magazines are being produced.andM;Farther in the future will come the ability to provide redundancy byconnecting a second AGI to the first.andP;  The exact implementation hasn't beendetermined.andP;  It might involve concurrent writing to both systems or dualrecording with a slight delay in storing the second copy.andP;  Optical discs areexpected to be supported by the end of 1990.andM;Birmy, Graphic Enterprises share spaceandM;Graphic Enterprises shared its booth with Birmy Graphics, where theydemonstrated the Birmy RIP Driving the Graphic Enterprises PageScan 3recorder.andP;  PageScan 3, which was introduced at ANPA, uses holographic optics,rather than the Ultre optical unit that resides in the PageScan 2.andP;  ThePageScan 3 was being demonstrated at 800-dpi resolution, although GraphicEnterprises has promised to have it up to 1,000 dpi soon.andM;Addressability of the unit has been extended from 1,000 dpi to more than3,000, which doesn't mean the effective resolution will be that high.andP;  Whatit means is that the print engine can be used to emulate high-resolutionimagesetters without requiring interpolation or pixel averaging.andP;  Forexample, it is now possible to emulate, pixel for pixel, the 3,048-dpi PelBox3000, although the effective resolution of the plain-paper PageScan 3 is only800 or 1,000 dpi.andM;Birmy news.andP;  Birmy announced that it is installing its new RIP based on theIntel 960 RISC processor, which increases significantly the speed of theBirmy output devices.andM;Birmy also renamed its new line of plain-paper printers based on the Canon SXengine.andP;  Now called PowerPrint they come in three varieties, with the onlydifference being the resolution supported.andP;  PowerPrint is available in apackage consisting of an SX engine, a RIP and a card to be inserted in an ATmachine, with the AT optional.andP;  Pricing without an AT is $6,000 to support aresolution of 800 x 400 dpi, $7,500 for 1,000 x 400 and $9,000 for 1,200 x400.andM;Other plain-paper recorders that Birmy supports are the 11&quot; x 17&quot; CanonLBP-20 (resolution: 960 x 480), which costs $26,900 with the RIP, and the 18&quot;x 24&quot; Graphic Enterprises PageScan 3, which costs $64,500 with the RIP.andP;  ThePageScan 3 was scheduled to be delivered in November.andP;  The PageScan 2 remainsavailable for $59,500, including the RIP.andM;Birmy's high-resolution line now includes the BirmySetter 300 TXF (PelBox3000), available starting this month with a 20-MB RIP for $61,900, and the500 TXF (PelBox 108S), available in December with a 56-MB RIP for $109,500.andO;The basic Birmy RIP tower, which includes a font disk and a spooling disk,sells for $4,800 with a 20-MHz '286 processor.andM;Hyphen unveils PC RIPandM;Hyphen's Graph Expo booth different notably from its IFRA one.andP;  In Chicago,it demonstrated the ability to output Adobe Type 1 fonts and it showed itsRIP software running in a PC.andP;  The PC, which drives the Ultre recorderdirectly, provides approximately the same performance as the Macintoshversion.andP;  It requires a minimum configuration of a 25-MHz '386 processor, 8MB of memory and a 100-MB disk.andP;  It supports LocalTalk and Ethernetconnections.andP;  Hyphen said it should run with the Chooser soon.andM;On the performance question, Hyphen said that with a 33-MHz '386 with 16 MBof memory, the speed was approximately the same as when it runs in aMacintosh with a Siclone accelerator board.andP;  But, we were told, when a '486machine is available, it should be faster than the Mac.andM;Pricing is the same as for the Mac version: $26,000 with a 72-pica Ultrerecorder (but without the PC hardware) or $39,000 with a 94-pica machine.andO;Initial installations are scheduled for December.andM;As at IFRA, Hyphen was driving the PelBox 3000 from the Hyphen hardware RIP,which comes for a package price of $89,000.andP;  (The 108S package costs$120,000.)andP;  Hyphen supports all of the resolution combinations of the 3000.andM;Hyphen said it had completed its port to the Sun SparcStation, but it wasn'tdemonstrated in Chicago.andP;  We were told that it is 80-90% as fast as theHyphen hardware RIP in rasterizing data, but that it loses speed in recordingbecause it doesn't have a real-time recorder interface.andM;Lasersmith shows 415-dpi PostScriptandM;At the low end of the market, Lasersmith demonstrated its 415-dpi,eight-page-per-minute PostScript printer based on a Canon CX engine and acontroller from Everex.andP;  It boasts 4 MB of memory, interfaces to PC andMacintosh computers, 35 Bistream fonts included, and a price of $3,995.andM;Linotype offers large-format prooferandM;Linotype didn't demonstrate the new Saturn Plus PostScript RIP that wasintroduced at IFRA (see last issue), but it did unveil a new 11&quot; x 17&quot;printer using an Adobe RIP.andP;  Called the Linotype Printer 30, it is based on aQMS machine with a Panasonic engine.andP;  Features include:andM;* Resolution of 300 dpi.andM;* Speed of up to 22 8-1/2&quot; x 14&quot; pages per minute.andM;* Duty cycle of 20,000 impressions per month.andM;* Toner supplied from a cartridge.andM;* Automatic switching between two input trays with capacities of 250 sheetseach.andM;* Thirty-five fonts and 4 mB of memory standard, expandable to 8 MB.andM;* External SCSI port and optional external hard disk.andM;* Support for LocalTalk, RS-232, RS-422 and Centronics input.andM;Pricing hasn't been announced, but we believe it will be in the range of$12,000 to $15,000--less expensive than the Dataproducts unit that comparesmost closely in features.andM;Mitsubishi shows new plate materialandM;Mitsubishi, which it represented in the U.S.andP;  by Mitsubishi PaperInternational, demonstrated new plyester-based laser-sensitive platematerials that can be imaged by helium-neon or laser-diode imaging devices.andO;The plates, part of the Silve-DigiPlate family, are called the SDP-FHN 100(helium-neon-sensitive) and the SDP-FLD 100.andP;  Before this, Mitsubishi hadoffered only a plate sensitive to argon-ion lasers, the SDP-FAr 175.andM;The advantage of polyester is that it can handle longer runs thatpaper-coated-base plates.andP;  Mitsubishi claims that they will reduce stretch inruns of 10,000 or more impressions.andM;Silver-DigiPlate materials use an activation/stabilization chemistry, ratherthan developer-based chemical systems.andM;Also introduced were platemakers for making multiple exposures from a singlepolyester-based original.andM;Mitsubishi Paper International, 520 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022;
