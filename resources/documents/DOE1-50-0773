<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0773 </DOCNO><TEXT>Equations of motion for an FEL of relativistic-strophotron type are averagedwith respect to fast oscillations; and the slow-motion phase, the dimensionlesstime, and the saturation parameter are investigated. It is shown that,in general, the resonant frequency and the radiated energy depend significantlyon the initial electron parameters: the initial transverse coordinateand the entry angle into the strophotron. An asymptotic expression forthe gain at higher harmonics of the resonant frequency, averaged overthe electron distribution in the beam cross section, is obtained in thestrong-field asymptotics. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
