Now it wants to soar free as an independent company.    Executives say Airbus expects to be in the black by the mid-1990s and no longer needs government subsidies. It wants to be able to buy or build plane components wherever the price is right, instead of relying mostly on its four sponsors.    But getting free won't be easy. The companies that own Airbus Industrie do more than make up its operating losses -- they are also its prime contractors. It's an arrangement they don't want to change, though many Airbus executives and some outsiders say it's inefficient and fraught with conflict of interest.    All this is creating strains inside Airbus's Hydra-headed structure. &quot;There are centrifugal forces in Airbus,&quot; says personnel chief Jacques Baniere. &quot;There are always politics in the background.&quot;    These legal, financial and management conflicts loom larger than ever now that Airbus no longer has to be spoon-fed. They are aggravated by a growing belief that the consortium must remake itself along more traditional business lines to give Boeing a serious race into the next century.    Airbus's owners differ in size, participation and motivation. As bosses, they want Airbus planes to sell at a profit. But as contractors, they want top prices for the wings, fuselages and other aircraft components they produce. The headquarters staff in Toulouse, which coordinates manufacturing and marketing, feels caught in the middle. After selling 1,200 airplanes since 1970, headquarters thinks it knows a thing or two and wants more control. In an unusual display of frankness, employees here blame the four partners -- Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. -- for a host of ills. They maintain that the partners pad the prices they charge Airbus and are intent on keeping jobs in their own countries, even to the detriment of the project as a whole.    While conceding that tensions do exist, Airbus's owners reject this view, though they agree change is needed. They counter that Airbus sells its planes too cheaply. They feel they have made enough concessions to Airbus, mainly by handing over the sales function rather than doing it themselves.    &quot;We have given our sales force to Airbus Industrie,&quot; says Hartmut Mehdorn, president of MBB's transport aircraft group and an Airbus executive board member. &quot;We've given them certain management powers. Now they think the partners are only subcontractors and they are the big chaps.&quot; But the Airbus shareholders, he says, won't surrender control.    Until recently, such bickering was ignored internally and kept from public view. Airbus was consumed with the challenge of becoming an aerospace giant against fierce competition. Nobody thought much about how Airbus was organized. But today, with new confidence and bulging order books, &quot;the big challenge of Airbus is to manage its success,&quot; says Robert Alizart, vice president of corporate communications. &quot;We've proved ourselves technologically. Now we have to prove ourselves in a management sense.&quot;    In the early days, a peculiarly French legal structure allowed the four partners the flexibility to build planes together without pooling assets or having to provide scarce equity. It let the four partners make Airbus decisions without revealing financial secrets.    The outside world hasn't always understood how the consortium works. A recent survey of airline executives found that, while they think Airbus offers great technology, &quot;the company as such is viewed as a weird animal,&quot; says one manager, &quot;while Boeing is {seen as} normal.&quot; Further, the airlines wonder how long &quot;the Airbus arrangement&quot; will hold together, the manager says.    The governments subsidizing Airbus worry that the consortium structure will perpetuate the need for handouts. Four independent businessmen appointed last year to review Airbus operations and finances recommended that it become a normal business corporation held by the partners, the public or both.    That idea has caught on here in Toulouse. Officials think Airbus must become more efficient and financially rational and less politicized if it is to capture a greater share of the aircraft market. They want Airbus to make its own operating decisions and employ directly the 30,000 people who build the planes in partners' factories.    The partners, to a greater or lesser degree, say they endorse the concept. Recently privatized British Aerospace is the most enthusiastic. &quot;But it's a difficult path to tread, from a political, legal and financial point of view,&quot; concedes Sydney Gillibrand, chairman of British Aerospace's civil aircraft division and an Airbus executive board member. The matter is under study, he says.    It isn't clear how the partners could afford to capitalize a new company. Would they pool the eight main factories and all the employees in the four countries that make the planes into a jointly owned holding company? If so, where would it be domiciled; who would get the tax benefits; and which country would get the trade-balance credit for exporting finished jetliners? Devising answers &quot;easily could take a decade,&quot; says Colm Mannin, Airbus's senior counsel.    The first coping mechanisms were put in place in April. Decision making was simplified. Airbus won more control over partners' work. A financial director was appointed to inspect partners' books and monitor prices charged for Airbus work.    But this isn't enough for the impatient staff in Toulouse. &quot;Airbus Industrie is the engine, and the partners the brakes,&quot; says one executive, who adds that the partners &quot;just don't want&quot; Airbus to stand alone.    Airbus's owners want to keep their aerospace skills in-house rather than hand them over to a new Eurocorporation. They want to retain jobs. They want to perform the most sophisticated engineering and production work while subcontracting out the mundane jobs. And with defense spending shrinking and Airbus on the verge of profitability, they don't see this as any time to let it slip away.    Moreover, the partners fear that an independent Airbus might choose to build the planes in Korea or another lower-cost place. The current system ensures that can't happen. On important issues such as launching new planes and dividing work, decisions must be unanimous. Thus CASA of Spain, with only a 4.2% stake, can block the others if it likes.    Despite the April reorganization, the supervisory and executive boards still include executives who may push national agendas. &quot;The countries aren't always playing a completely open and transparent game with Airbus,&quot; says Mr. Baniere, the personnel chief.    ---@ Airbus Industrie @ Ownership by percentage @ Aerospatiale (France) 37.9% @ Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm 37.9% @ British Aerospace (United Kingdom) 20.0% @ Construcciones Aeronauticas (Spain) 4.2% @ Airbus founded: 1970 @ Backlog (through July): 706 jetliners @ Deliveries: 504 jetliners @ Customers: 80 airlines @ Source: Airbus Industrie </TEXT></DOC>
