The utility said that in exchange, it has asked the commission to allow it to keep any benefits it receives from the new tax law, and from debt refinancings or cost-cutting measures it may take, instead of passing those benefits on to ratepayers. Kansas Gas also has asked that it be allowed to depreciate its Wolf Creek nuclear power plant over 40 years instead of 30 years, thus cutting expenses.    In addition, the utility proposes setting up a corporate-owned life insurance plan that would generate revenue.    The company said the proposal calls for it to defer a planned $14.6 million rate increase to 1989 from 1987, and a $15.6 million boost to 1992 from 1988. The company could continue to reflect the rate increases as deferred revenue, a spokesman said.    The move would give customers a better sense of what their future rates will be and &quot;make us more competitive in the marketplace,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
