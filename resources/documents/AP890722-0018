Investigators also told of a heroic effort by an off-duty pilotto help gain control of the airplane.   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jim Burnett saidan off-duty United pilot was on the plane and offered hisassistance to flight attendants shortly after the rear engine blew.   The pilot was allowed into the cockpit to help the co-pilotwrest control of the crippled plane.   ``The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use enginethrust,'' Burnett said. The off-duty pilot ``was on his kneesmanipulating the throttle.   ``What you have here is a situation of two men desperatelytrying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' hesaid.   Rescue officials said Friday they had recovered 109 bodies andplanned to lift a large section of the fuselage with a crane to seeif there were two more bodies underneath. More than 180 peoplesurvived the crash.   It was not known whether the off-duty pilot, whose name was notreleased, survived the crash, but United reported shortly after thecrash Wednesday that everyone in the cockpit had survived.   United, however, still had not released definite figures on thenumber of victims and survivors nearly 2{ days after the crash.Burnett said 111 people were killed, and United said 109 peopledied.   Burnett said NTSB figures showed 297 were on board, two morethan earlier reports, and that there were 186 survivors. Unitedsaid there were 296 on board with 187 survivors.   ``I don't know what the NTSB is using for their count,'' saidSue Moss, United spokeswoman. ``We feel ours is correct.''   Of the injured, 47 remained at two hospitals Friday inconditions ranging from very critical to good.   State Medical Examiner Tom Bennett said an autopsy would beperformed on all bodies recovered, to determine the cause of deathand to ease family concerns.   ``I'd rather have the evidence and the answers right now for thefamily members. Three to six months down the road, they're going tobe tormented by this. They are going to come back to us withquestions,'' he said.   Bennett said 12 autopsies had been completed, with pathologists,crime investigators, FBI fingerprint experts and dentists workingin a makeshift morgue set up in a hangar at the Air National Guardbase adjacent to the airport.   Meanwhile, investigators from the National Transportation SafetyBoard began measuring the tail section from the shattered plane inthe search for clues to the crash.   ``The fan on the engine in the tail is not with the rest of thewreckage,'' said Burnett. ``We hope to be able to find that, andwe're going to be looking at an additional wreckage area about 60miles away from the principal site.''   Field workers near Alta, about 55 miles east of Sioux City,reported a large section of the jumbo jet in a test fieldWednesday, shortly before the jet crashed, turned a cartwheel andexploded in flames during an emergency landing at Sioux GatewayAirport. Flight 232 had been bound for Chicago and Philadelphiafrom Denver.   Burnett said that early examination of the hydraulic lines ledinvestigators to conclude that at least two were severed.   ``They were cut cleanly. It's very clean,'' he said.   Burnett said the third hydraulic line was badly damaged fromcontact with the ground.   Burnett also said preliminary findings showed that the smallwing of the tail had several holes and the hydraulic system hadlost all fluid. The hydraulic system is routed through the tail andallows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls.   Investigators were surprised to discover the entire fan-rotorsystem missing from the rear engine, the first time he has seenthat, Burnett said. The DC-10 has three engines, one on each wingand on the tail.   Burnett acknowledged Friday that it was conceivable that piecesof metal spewing from a disintegrating rear engine could havecaused the small holes on on the tail wing and could have severedthe hydraulic lines in the tail section. But he cautioned againstjumping to conclusions about the cause of the accident, a warningechoed by aviation expert Pat Murphy.   ``If you start with an engine throwing off the blades (of thefan), called an uncontained failure, it's a plausible chain ofevents to get at how the steering may have been knocked out,''Murphy, vice president of operations for Avtias Inc., a Reston,Va.-based aircraft consulting firm, said in a telephone interview.   ``But what is being speculated may not have happened. And fromthe standpoint of the industry, what is potentially much moreimportant is why the engine developed uncontained failure,'' hesaid. ``The CF6 (engine) is not historically a blade-throwingengine.''   The manufacturer, General Electric Co., said its GE AircraftEngines division sent a five-member team to help investigate.   The chief flight attendant told the NTSB an explosion rocked thejet over western Iowa, knocking flight attendants to the floor,Burnett said at a news conference late Thursday. The attendant, whowas unidentified, went into the cockpit and found the flight crewstruggling to regain control of the plane, he said.   Thirty-four minutes before trying the emergency landing, thepilot told air traffic controllers he had almost no control of theaircraft, Burnett said.   Investigators also were reviewing maintenance records on the15-year-old jet. Burnett said repair work involving the rear enginewas done on the plane the day before the crash, to correct aproblem with the pneumatic system.   The pneumatic system uses excess pressure generated by the giantengine to power the aircraft's air-conditioning system. Burnettsaid there was no way that problem ``would have, could have''affected the engine itself.   Iowa air and army national guardsmen and investigators from theFBI and the state Department of Criminal Investigation continued tolook for wreckage around the runway.   Their efforts focused on a large, blackened section of thefuselage lying in a cornfield alongside the scorched runway whereUnited pilot Capt. Al C. Haynes brought the crippled jumbo jet down.   The National Guard and medical examiners had asked families fordental and medical records and other information that would helpidentify the victims, said Sinda.   Bennett said two-thirds of the victims apparently were killed bythe impact of the crash, and the remaining third in the fire ittouched off. Visual identification is often impossible for burnvictims, Bennett said. The victims also included children, whofrequently haven't had dental X-rays taken, he said.   The Rev. Lawrence Soens, bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese ofSioux City, said a special Mass for about 400 people at noon.   ``There are moments of great tragedy when our very nature callsout to God,'' Soens said during his homily. ``This is such amoment.''</TEXT></DOC>
