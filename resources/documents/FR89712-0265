The rule regulates polystyrenefoam manufacturing in the Kern County Air Pollution Control Disrict (APCD).Section 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(a)(1) of the CAA, 40 CFR 51.110, and EPA policyrequire that SIPs provide for the attainment of the National Ambient AirQuality Standards (NAAQS) ``as expeditiously as practicable.'' Section110(a)(3)(B) of the CAA, 40 CFR 51.104 extend the SIP requirements in section110 and 40 CFR Part 51 to SIP revisions. The revision to Kern County Rule414.4 represents a weakening of SIP requirements in that it will permitincreased VOC emissions by extending the compliance date. The State hasfailed to demonstrate that this SIP revision will provide for the attainmentand maintenance of NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable. In addition to not meeting the CAA requirements listed above, amended KernCounty Rule 414.4 is inconsistent with EPA policy. The rule lacks a testmethod, the compliance period is not specified, and there are no recordkeepingrequirements. The incorporation of non-specific guidelines for the designof the collection system is also inconsistent with EPA policy. As a resultof this disapproval, the original version of Rule 414.4 will remain a partof the Federally approved SIP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Comments will be considered by EPA if they aresubmitted on or before August 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Please address any comments to: Colleen McKaughan,Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 215 Fremont Street, San Francisco,CA 94105.

Background </ITAG>1. Kern County Ozone SIP EPA has proposed to disapprove Kern County's Ozone Plan (52 FR 26428) sinceit failed to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by December 31,1987, or a fixed near-term date thereafter. As a nonattainment area, KernCounty is subject to the requirements of Part D of the CAA and EPA policythat pertains to post-87 nonattainment areas. The following is a summaryof the history of Kern County's ozone SIP. For a more complete background,see 52 FR 26428, July 14, 1987. On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of nonattainment areas that includedKern County as a nonattainment area for the ozone NAAQS (43 FR 8962). OnOctober 12, 1979, CARB submitted to EPA an ozone control plan for KernCounty that purported to show attainment of the ozone standard by December31, 1982, and to satisfy the requirements of Part D of the CAA.On August 21, 1981, EPA published a notice of final rulemaking conditionallyapproving the 1979 Kern County Ozone Plan, with the stipulation that theemissions inventory and emission reduction estimates be corrected and thata revised control strategy reflecting the corrections be submitted to EPAby October 1, 1981 (46 FR 42450). CARB did not meet this deadline.Kern County did not attain the ozone standard by the statutory date ofDecember 31, 1982. Subsequently, EPA supplemented the conditions describedabove with a notice of SIP deficiency under section 110(a)(2)(H), and therebyissued a call for a SIP revision. The State was required to submit a revisedozone attainment demonstration to EPA, showing attainment of the ozonestandard by the statutory deadline of December 31, 1987.On July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26428), EPA published a notice proposing disapprovalof the attainment and RFP (reasonable further progress) demonstration portionof the 1979 SIP because it failed to provide for attainment of the ozoneNAAQS by December 31, 1987, or a fixed near-term date thereafter. In doingso, EPA also proposed to rescind its prior conditional finding that the1979 Plan satisfied Part D of the CAA. This action was taken because thecondition of approval on the 1979 Kern County Ozone Plan, regarding theattainment demonstration, had not been met.Kern County again failed to attain the standard by the statutory deadlineon May 26, 1988. EPA issued a finding that the SIP is substantially inadequateto attain or maintain the NAAQS. In addition, the State failed to fulfillcertain conditions in the SIP. Under these circumstances, EPA does notconsider Kern County to have an approved ozone plan (see 53 FR 45104, November8, 1988).2. Kern County Rule 414.4CARB first submitted Kern County Rule 414.4 Polystyrene Foam Manufacturing,to EPA on July 30, 1981. EPA approved this version for inclusion in theCalifornia SIP on October 11, 1983 (48 FR 46046). The rule requires thatany person operating any equipment for the storage and extrusion of recycledpolystyrene foam or the storage of blowing agents containing VOCs, eitherreduce emissions by at least 95% by weight, use a non-VOC compound, orcontrol emissions by a method equivalent in emissions control to the firsttwo options.On November 18, 1985, the Kern County Air Pollution Control Board rescindedRule 414.4. The Board then transmitted its action to CARB as a proposedrevision to the SIP. CARB determined that the rescission of Rule 414.4would constitute a relaxation of the SIP and informed Kern County's AirPollution Control Officer (APCO) on May 15, 1986, that it would not besubmitting the rescission of Rule 414.4 to EPA as a SIP revision.On July 11, 1988, the Kern County Air Pollution Control Board adopted anew version on Rule 414.4. CARB forwarded it to EPA as a SIP revision onOctober 14, 1988. EPA requested additional information from the Kern CountyAPCD through CARB. On February 13, 1989, EPA deemed the submittal completeand began evaluation of the proposed SIP revision. Because the November18, 1985, rescission was not forwarded to EPA, the original version ofRule 414.4 remains part of the federally approved SIP. The submittal ofthe revised version of 414.4 is therefore being evaluated as a rule revision,rather than a new rule submittal.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. EPA Evaluation</ITAG>The revision of Rule 414.4 incorporates several changes to the originalversion, some of which are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and EPApolicy. These changes, and other deficiencies that EPA has identified,are divided into three categories and discussed below.1. Compliance Date ExtensionAmong the proposed revisions to Rule 414.4 is a change in the compliancedate from December 31, 1982, to December 31, 1988. This revision, if approvedby EPA, would effectively grant the source a six year extension on thecompliance deadline. EPA has a policy of approving compliance date extensions,but only under certain circumstances. A detailed discussion of EPA policyregarding compliance date extensions is found in Appendix A of 53 FR 45103(November 8, 1988). Appendix A provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">A SIP revision seeking a compliance date extension amounts to a relaxationof the SIP requirements because the company would be permitted to emitgreater amounts of pollutants for a longer period. EPA may approve theSIP revision only if the state shows the greater amounts of pollution willnot interfere with attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS by the requireddate, and with RFP \1\<NOTE/> in the interim. The State cannot make this showing if ithas not submitted an approvable attainment demonstration identifying theattainment date and the RFP line. Accordingly, EPA cannot approve a compliancedate extension in an area locking an approved attainment demonstration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``Reasonable further progress'' (RFP) is defined (in theClean Air Act) as_annual incremental reductions in emissions of the applicableair pollutant (including substantial reductions in the early years followingapproval or promulgation of plan provisions * * * and regular reductionsthereafter) which are sufficient in the judgment of the Administrator,to provide for attainment of the applicable national ambient air qualitystandard by the date required * * * 42 U.S.C. 7501(1).In summary, when extending a compliance date, the State must demonstratethat the action does not or did not interfere with the attainment and maintenanceof the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later thanthe statutory attainment date (December 31, 1987). The compliance datein this case (December 31, 1988), goes beyond the statutory deadline. Inaddition, Kern County lacks an approved attainment demonstration whichprecludes EPA's approval of a compliance date extension. 2. Technical Deficiencies The revised version of Rule 414.4 adds an exemption for stationary tanks,reservoirs and containers that hold or store VOC blowing agents and havea capacity of 200 gallons or less. This change weakens the SIP by relaxingthe requirements of the rule and could result in increased emissions. Adequatetechnical information that would justify the relaxation of control requirementshas not been submitted to the EPA. 3. Enforceability/Legal Sufficiency IssuesIn addition to relaxing the federally approved version of Kern County Rule414.4 as discussed above, the amended version does not comply with EPApolicy. EPA has identified certain key provisions (enforceability criteria)that are required in SIPs to ensure enforceability and legal sufficiency.See ``Review of SIPs and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency'',policy memorandum, Michael S. Alushin, Associate Enforcement Counsel forAir Enforcement, <T3>et al., </T3>to Regional Offices, September 23, 1987. In addition,in Appendix D of ``State Implementation Plans; Approval of Post-1987 Ozoneand Carbon Monoxide Plan Revisions for Areas Not Attaining the NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards'' (52 FR 45044, November 24, 1987), EPA affirmedthe importance of enforceability criteria to rule effectiveness and summarizedcommon inconsistencies and discrepancies from EPA policy found in currentSIPs. Finally, on May 25, 1988, EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning andStandards issued ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies,and Deviations.'' This document provided additional clarification to thedeficiencies cited in Appendix D (52 FR 45044). Kern County Rule 414.4 contains some of the deficiencies noted in the documentscited above. The rule does not specify a test method or compliance period,and it lacks recordkeeping requirements. Without these provisions, it isimpossible to determine if the source is in compliance with the rule. BothEPA and CARB noted these deficiencies in comments provided to the KernCounty APCD during the rule development stage. It is EPA's policy that ``regulation(s) must be sufficiently specific sothat a source is fairly on notice as to the standard it must meet'' (seethe September 23, 1987, policy memo cited above). Revised Rule 414.4 requiresthat the collection system must be ``designed to meet American Conferenceof Industrial Hygienists Guidelines and Sheet Metal and Air ConditioningContractors National Association Guidelines.'' The Sheet Metal and AirConditioning National Association has published several sets of guidelines,some of which have multiple editions. The American Conference of IndustrialHygienists has published twenty editions of their industrial ventilationmanual. It is unclear which of these guidelines must be followed. The inclusionof these ill-defined standards in Rule 414.4 is inconsistent with EPA policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">EPA Proposed Action</ITAG>Under section 110 and Part D of the CAA, EPA is proposing to disapproveamended Kern County Rule 414.4 because it weakens the existing CaliforniaSIP and is inconsistent with the CAA, 40 CFR Part 51, and EPA policy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Process</ITAG>Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.) This action does not subject the source to a new rule.It retains a 1983 EPA approved rule in its entirety. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administratorunder procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and Table 3SIP revisions (52 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executiveorder 12291 for a period of two years. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmentalrelations, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 22, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Daniel W.
