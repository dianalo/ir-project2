May and June projections on crude oil production by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and in theNorth Sea's U.K. sector figured prominently in marketresults, as prices jumped as much as 76 cents a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   There were new industry reports of OPEC output cuts --mainly in the Middle East -- totaling as much as 700,000barrels a day so far this month, in line with the May 3agreement. Some trackers of OPEC production questioned thereported sizes of such reductions. But one authoritativemonitor confirmed that his figures now show OPEC's productionnearing 23 million barrels a day after averaging 23.7 millionbarrels, according to his calculations, in April.   On top of the OPEC reports, meantime, came news that inJune the North Sea's Brent crude oil production andtransportation system will be able to load only aboutone-half of its usual monthly volume of more than 30 cargoes.Reasons for the reduction include both planned andunscheduled maintenance factors as well as labor problems.   &quot;The bottom line,&quot; said John Hill, a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.vice president of energy trading, &quot;is that only 16 cargoeswill be loaded.&quot;   Some traders suggested that both the OPEC and North Seadevelopments already had been factored into the oil markets.Still, the developments ignited a rally in crude oil pricesthat began in European spot and futures markets and thenspread to the U.S.   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent blendcrude oil futures closed up between 33 cents and 50 cents abarrel in heavy trading. On European spot markets, North Seacrudes were up between 30 cents and 60 cents a barrel.   In the U.S., Marathon Petroleum and Sun Refining andamp;Marketing Co. set off what is likely to be a new round ofincreases of 75 cents a barrel in field postings for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark crude. The refiners' newWTI posting is $18.50 a barrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June futurescontract for a WTI-like crude increased 76 cents a barrel tosettle at $19.71. Unleaded gasoline and heating oil futuresalso were up sharply, as much as 1.57 cents a gallon for somecontracts.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices for platinum and silverrose, but gold edged lower. July delivery platinum advanced$3.30 an ounce to $487.20. July silver was up two cents anounce to $5.1250. June gold slipped 60 cents an ounce to$369.90. Although Johnson Matthey, the world's largestplatinum-products company, said in its latest annual reviewof the platinum market yesterday that South Africa wouldraise its output by 39% over the next five years, itsobservation that strikes and violence are expected to cutthat nation's estimates in the next few years stimulateddemand for futures. Yesterday there were reports of a strikeat a small South African platinum mine, analysts said. Oneanalyst said it created concern that it could be a sign offurther labor unrest in the future. Johnson Matthey said thatthe Soviet Union's platinum exports in the first quarter thisyear were lower after soaring last year to the highest levelsince 1977, and could decline for the year as a whole. As forgold, there was very little investment demand, &quot;and thesurging stock market didn't help it either,&quot; said oneanalyst.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices eased on traders' perceptions thatdemand for the metal may be easing and supplies growing. TheJuly contract declined 2.65 cents a pound to $1.15. JohnGross, president of J.E. Gross andamp; Associates, Inc., acopper-industry consulting firm in New City, N.Y., observedthat brass and rod mill use of copper &quot;is good, but down fromthe levels earlier this year.&quot; Analysts and dealers estimatedthat London Metal Exchange warehouse inventories of coppertoday may rise by 4,000 tons to 8,000 tons. Mr. Gross said hethought those estimates were high, but agreed that peoplethink supplies are rising. Copper inventories of New York'sCommodity Exchange yesterday rose by 428 tons, to 6,335 tons,he noted. Mr. Gross also cited the Commodity Exchange'saction last week in increasing margins, or good-faith money,for transactions in May contracts and the exchange's noticethat it would go to a full price for May contracts nextMonday. The result has been, Mr. Gross said, for the openinterest, or number of May contracts outstanding that remainto be nullified by either an opposite trade or delivery or acommodity, to decline significantly. This decline will reduceconcerns over deliveries against the May contract as itapproaches its last trading day on May 29, he said.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices rose to life-of-contract highsbecause of unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largestcocoa producer, and predictions of higher prices by two majortrade firms. The July contract soared $105 a metric ton to$1,406. At its high during the day, July traded at $1,410,setting a new life-of-contract high that topped $1,384, seton April 11. Analysts said troops surrounded the presidentialresidence in Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast, andprotested economic conditions. Also, unarmed troopssurrounded the radio station in that city, but later returnedto their barracks, analysts said. Arthur Stevenson, analystfor Prudential-Bache Securities, said the events were thelatest in turmoil that has plagued that country in the pastthree months. Another analyst, Sandra Kaul of Shearson LehmanHutton, said two of the world's biggest commodity tradefirms, Salomon Inc.'s Philipp Bros. unit, based in New York,and Paris-based Sucre et Denrees agreed in separate addressesat a Paris luncheon on Saturday that prices would risesignificantly and perhaps double. &quot;This caused a real rush ofbuying in London and New York, because these firms in thepast have been very much on opposite sides of the market,&quot;said Ms. Kaul. The reports caused many traders who hadpreviously sold contracts in anticipation of further pricedeclines &quot;to panic and buy back their contracts,&quot; she said.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices slid in acontinuation of Friday's reaction to government figurespredicting an increase in soybean stockpiles for the1990-1991 crop year. The Agriculture Department peggedsoybean stocks at 355 million bushels for the 1990-1991period, compared with last season's carry-over of 305 millionbushels. Widespread rain across Midwestern and Southerngrowing regions, and predictions for more of the same, alsodepressed soybean futures prices. Analysts said they areworried that farmers, unable at present to plant corn andcotton in flooded fields, will substitute soybeans for thesecrops as their fields dry out. That increase in soybeanacreage would be expected to boost supply and depress pricesin the soybean and soybean futures markets. Most corn isplanted in the Midwest by the end of May, while farmerstypically wait up to a month later to plant soybeans. Soybeanfutures for July delivery dropped eight cents a bushel to$6.3575 a bushel. Wet weather provided modest support towheat futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade asanalysts said that some wheat crops had been damaged byflooding, and that wheat rust, a disease that can reduceyields, had been spotted in Oklahoma. Wheat futures prices onthe Kansas City Board of Trade were slightly lower. Cornfutures prices, supported by continued tight supplies, closedmostly higher, despite the sell-off in the adjacent soybeanfutures pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. July corn futuresgained 0.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.9075 a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
