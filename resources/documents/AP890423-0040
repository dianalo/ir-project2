Organizers said about 3,000 people, some chanting ``Protect ourchildren'' and ``Remove nuclear plants,'' marched in the rain inKawasaki, just south of Tokyo, and gathered along the Tama River.   ``We must be more sensitive against contamination and pollution,even if such struggles are held far away from metropolitandistricts,'' Kohtaro Yamamoto said as he watched a concert that waspart of the rally.   ``Various signs indicate that a turning point in theanti-nuclear movement has been reached after the Chernobyldisaster,'' said Eriko Hirai, 32, a homemaker who joined in theprotest.   The April 26, 1986, accident at the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of northern andcentral Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from severalcountries. Hundreds were hospitalized, including at least 31 whodied from radiation-related injuries.   Elsewhere in Japan on Sunday, organizers said more than 1,000people rallied in Osaka, Japan's second-largest city; 600 turnedout in the central city of Nagoya; and 300 demonstrated in Kyoto inwestern Japan.   In the western port of Kobe, about 1,500 people demonstratedSaturday at the Kansai Electric Power Co.   Despite recent reductions in nuclear power development in somecountries, Japan plans to produce more electricity with nuclearpower to reduce reliance on oil imports. Nuclear plants now meet 28percent of Japan's power needs, the government says. Utilitiespredict that share will rise to 36 percent by 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
