The American Petroleum Institute's figures, released after the close of trading, showed surprising drops in U.S. distillate, gasoline, crude oil and import stockpiles in the week ended last Friday.    More significant, analysts said, was a fall in the domestic refinery utilization rate of almost three percentage points, to 75.2% of capacity from 78.1% the week before. That augurs less refined products on the market in the weeks ahead.    The lower refinery utilization numbers also indicate that &quot;many refiners are trying to use their existing stockpiles to satisfy demand,&quot; said Stephen Platt, senior analyst in Chicago for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Many analysts and traders had been anticipating only slight stockpile and refinery-run declines. &quot;The potential for a large stock surplus has been significantly reduced,&quot; said Robert Boslego, vice president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., oil-consulting firm. In recent months, many analysts had been concerned about the huge excess of supplies on the market.    Crude oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 23 cents a barrel to $18.35. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also spurted higher.    The spot, or noncontract, price of West Texas Intermediate, the premier U.S. crude, rose 25 cents a barrel to $18.35. Meanwhile, the March price of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European blend, surged 35 cents to $18 in late trading.    Some traders who were sitting on the sidelines earlier in the week waiting for clues to the market's direction came back in force, especially early in the session, said Eric Bolling, an oil broker in Boston for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Computer-guided trading added to the early gains, traders said.    But some of the gains faded late in the day. To some traders, that suggested possible follow-through selling today.    Still, further gains in the coming weeks are expected, many analysts said. &quot;We're still in a bull mode,&quot; said a New York trader.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures closed lower after trading in a narrow range. March futures on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index got an occasional boost when they slipped below the index itself and numerous arbitrage programs called for buying futures and selling the underlying stocks. But futures were weakened by anticipation of the March 20 &quot;triple witching hour,&quot; when stock-index futures and options and stock options expire simultaneously, traders said. Also, some traders fear the stock market could be poised for a correction after its recent sharp rise. &quot;People don't want to pay a premium for the futures,&quot; concluded Steve Tsang, stock-index strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Weak beef carcass prices and sluggish demand for boxed beef depressed futures prices. An Agriculture Department report slated for release late Monday should show an 11% increase from a year earlier in the number of young cattle placed on feedlots in seven major beef-producing states during February, said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. That may depress the prices of contracts for June and July delivery, when the animals will be ready for slaughter, Mr. Levitt said. He also expects a 3% decline from a year earlier in the number of animals on feed as of March 1. Sales for slaughter during February should come in about even with a year earlier, he said.    SUGAR: World sugar eased. Trade sources said some European sugar processors, who also act as dealers, sold Paris white sugar futures yesterday. That prompted selling of raw sugar futures in New York. Also, the sources said, European producers angry over what they perceive as low Common Market subsidies are expected to put economic pressure on the Common Market by placing an estimated one million metric tons of beet sugar into the community's intervention stocks. Eventually that sugar would be sold onto the world market and might depress prices. The first report of European sugar beet planting plans for the coming season was released yesterday by F.O. Licht, a West German sugar statistics firm. Plans for planting are little changed from last year, said the report, which consequently had no discernible impact on the market, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
