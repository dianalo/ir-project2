Rainwater said it and a shareholder group that includes Bethesda, Md.-based Energy Recovery Fund are considering seeking control of Denver-based Consolidated Oil andamp; Gas Inc.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Rainwater group said the groups might seek control or a controlling interest through a proxy solicitation to remove current directors.    Other possible courses include presenting a proposal to Consolidated's board to make a capital infusion into the company and recommending restructuring.    According to the filing, the groups have had preliminary talks with Consolidated's chairman, Harry A. Trueblood, in which they discussed board representation as a condition for providing capital.    According to the filing, the Rainwater group holds a 13.1% stake in Consolidated. And according to a previous SEC filing, the Energy Recovery group holds the equivalent of about 20%.    Consolidated declined to comment until it reviews the filing. </TEXT></DOC>
